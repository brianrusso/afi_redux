Fixed Prosthesis. A fixed prosthesis is any of a variety of replacements for a missing tooth or a part of a tooth a dentist attaches to the mouth and the patient cannot rem ove. Restoration such as inlays, pinledge castings, onlays, crowns, ve neers, and fixed partial dentures  (FPD) fall into this category. A fixed prosthesis m ay be constructed entirely from  cast metal alloy, acrylic  porcelains. It may also be constructed from a combination of these materials. 1.2.  Die. A  die  is a po sitive rep roduction of  a prepared to oth m ade f rom a suitab le, hard sub stance (improved artif icial s tone or m etal). A die can be c onstructed from  a  com plete arch, partial arch, or  individual tooth im pression. Fixed pr ostheses are m ade by either th e direct or indirect m ethod. The dentist uses  the  direct  method  when carving the for m of the restoration on the natural tooth in the patient’s mouth. The dentist  or technician uses the   indirect  method  when form ing the shape of the restoration outside of the m outh on a die. Because there is such ove rwhelming dependence on dies in fixed prosth etic den tistry, a die has to be extraordinarily accurate an d m ethods of m aintaining the positions of dies on casts must be perfectly dependable. 1.3. Wax Pattern. With the exception of complete porcelain or resin restorations, at least part of a fixed prosthesis is cast in metal. Castings are made from wax patterns. A  wax pattern is an exact wax replica of a desired shape. W hen the wa x pattern is invested and burned  out, a casting can be m ade in the resultant mold. If the dentist carves the pa ttern wax in the patient’s m outh, it is a  direct pattern. Small inlays and complete crown cores are sometimes done this way. If the wa x pattern is adapted and carved on a die, it is a indirect pattern.  Section 1B—Types of Fixed Prostheses 1.4. Inlays: 1.4.1. An  inlay  is a den tal resto ration that fits  into  a p repared cav ity. It is held in place by its precision fit and by using a bondi ng composite method or a cem enting medium. Because in lays intracoronal are, for the m ost part, surrounded by intact restorations. The variou s forms of inlays are p rimarily used to restore i ndividual tooth contour s and function. In the m ajority of cas es, an inlay is not a suitable an chor casting (reta iner) for an FPD. Inlays are usually cast in m edium hard gold,  but they can be m ade of porcelain or acrylic resin. There are five clas ses of inlays, based on the lo cation of the surfaces  being restored (shown in Figure 1.1 and as follows): tooth structure, they  are often called 1.4.1.1. Class I—Located on the occlusal surfaces of premolars or molars. 1.4.1.2. Class II—Located on an occlusal surface combined with one or both proximal surfaces. 1.4.1.3. Class III— Made for the m esial or distal su rfaces of anterior teeth. This clas sification does not involve incisal angles. 1.4.1.4. Class IV—Made for the m esial and distal su rface of an anterior tooth plus on e or both of its incisal angles. 1.4.1.5. Class V—Limited to the facial surface of any of the teeth. 1.4.2. A more specific way of na ming an inlay  is to  cite th e tooth surfaces it resto res. Examples include a disto-incisal (DI) inlay, mesio-inciso-distal (MID) inlay, mesio-occlusal (MO) inlay, and mesio-occluso-distal (MOD) inlay (shown in Figure 1.2). AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 1.1. Inlay Classifications.  Figure 1.2. MOD (Class II) Inlay. 15   1.5. Pinledges:  1.5.1. A pinledge is a thin, cast rest oration that covers the lingual  and one proximal surface of an anterior tooth. It is usually categorized as a speci alized form of inlay. What distinguishes it from a conventional inlay is th at it has two  or three  parallel pins, about 1.5 to  2 m illimeters (mm) long, that penetrate the lingual dentin for retention. The thinness of the casting and the small diameter of the pins require that the pinledge be construc ted of a hard, nonprecious metal or gold alloy (Type  IV gold).  1.5.2. A modification to the preparation m ay be s een with resin-bonded FP Ds. It is the least reliable of inlay restorations and potentially destructive to an abutment tooth. A pinledge functions best as filling for a cavity and should not ordinarily be expected to do more. 1.6.  Onlays  and  Veneers. Onlay restorations are m ade from   cast g old or cer amic m aterials th at ordinarily cover the MOD surfaces of posterior teeth. On the anterior teeth, porcelain veneers may cover facial, incisal, and lingual surfaces. An onlay d iffers from an inlay in  this respect. An onlay covers the entire occlusal surface of a tooth to  include th e cusps. An onlay is th e smallest of the fixed prosthe tic restorations class ified as   extracoronal. W hereas an intr acoronal repla cement like a n inlay f its  into  a tooth, an extracoronal restoration fits around what remains of a tooth. For many dentists, an onlay is the minimum restoration adequate to act as a FPD retainer. 16  1.7. Artificial Crowns. An artificial crown is a fixed prosthetic restoration that covers more than half of the tooth ’s surface exp osed to view in the patienextracoronal restoration, and the following kinds ofcategory: t’s m outh (Figure 1.3). Onlays are classified as  crowns m ake up the balance of extracoronal AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 1.7.1. Complete Crown—Covers the entire surface anatomy of a tooth’s clinical crown as follows: 1.7.1.1. Metal—Constructed entirely of a noncorrosive metal such as gold (Figure 1.3-A). 1.7.1.2. Veneered—A complete coverage; that is, a m etal substructure overlaid with porce lain or resin for esthetic effect (Figure 1.3-B).  Figure 1.3. Some Types of Artificial Crowns.   1.7.1.3. Jacket—A complete crown for an an terior tooth made entirely from porcelain or from  acrylic resin. 1.7.1.4. Post Crown—A com plete crown of any ki nd (complete metal, veneer) supported by a metal extension (post) into a tooth’s root canal. Endodontically treated teeth are teeth that have had the pulps rem oved and root c anals f illed. Such teeth  eventua lly becom e brittle and a re prone to f racture. In m any instan ces, there is  little co ronal substan ce lef t and re storations continually come loose from them. To maintain an endodontically treated tooth as an abutment capable of supporting and retain ing a crown, it is comm on practice to cement a post about 2/3 of the way into a root canal. The part of the pos t that protrudes from the root canal is called the core. Combined with the remains of the coronal part of the tooth, the core, is built to resemble a complete crown preparation. After the post and co re are cem ented into the root, a com plete crown is fabricated on top of this foundation (Figure 1.4). 1.7.2. Partial Crown—Made entirely from metal that covers more than half, but less than the entire tooth’s clinical crown. A partial  crown is named according to the fractional amount of the clinical crown it covers. Examples include half, three-eighths crowns (Figure 1.3-D). quarters (Figure 1.3-C), four-fifths, and seven-1.8. Fixed Partial Denture (FPD). An FP D is a restoratio n designed to replace on e or m ore missing natural teeth. In con trast to a  removable partial denture (RPD), the de ntist attaches an FPD to natura l teeth, roots, or im plants  by cem entation or screws. A  primary  abutment  is a  t ooth or  r oot us ed for support and anchorage of one of the ends of an FPD. An  intermediate abutment is a tooth without other natural teeth in proximal contact, situated between two primary abutments. The typical FPD consists of  the parts shown in Figure 1.5 and as follows: AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 1.4. Post Crown. 17  Figure 1.5. Parts of a Typical FPD.    1.8.1. Retainers. A re tainer is a c asting the d entist attaches to an  abutment tooth to secur e and support the FPD’s artificial tooth or teeth. 1.8.2.  Pontics. Pontic is the general nam e for any ar tificial tooth suspended from a retainer. Pontics are classified according to the kinds of  materials used to m ake them and according to the way they relate to gingival tissue under them (gingival adaptation), as follows: 1.8.2.1. Classification of Pontics Based on Materials Used in Construction: AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 1.8.2.1.1. Complete Metal Pontic. Use of  these pontics is lim ited to the posterior areas of  the mouth where they are not likely to be seen. 1.8.2.1.2. Cast Metal Combined With Prefabricated Resin or Porcelain Blank. Blanks are commercially available in anterior and pos terior tooth form s and in  a selection of sizes and shades.  The dentis t selects th e approp riate blank and custom  gr inds it to fit a n edentulous s pace. The rest of th e artificial tooth , whether a b acking for an anterio r or an  occlusal surface for a posterior, is waxed and cast in m etal. The dentist then cements the  modified resin or porcelain blank to its retaining post on the metal casting. Figure 1.6 shows types of prefabricated pontics and backings. 18   Figure 1.6. Prefabricated Pontics and Backings.  1.8.2.1.3.  Veneered  Pontic. The majority of the pontic’s substructure is  cast m etal; the balance consists of a layer of acrylic resin or porcelain processed onto it. Acrylic veneers are mechanically retained by incorporating retention beads or loops into the casting. Porcelain is retained by baking and fusing it  directly to the  m etal substructur e. The  tip  of  a po ntic is   AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  19 usually made to contact gingival tissue. If the part of a pontic contacting the gingiva is made from a m aterial tha t is  chem ically activ e or c ollects deb ris, inf lammation will p robably result. Glazed porcelain  and highly polished  gold provoke m inimal tissue reaction. Acrylic resin is second best. F ood tends to stick m ore  to a p lastic surface, bacteria g row in the debris, and produce tox ic products th at irritate tissue.  In time, resin will absorb o ral fluids and acquire an unpleasant odor. 1.8.2.2.  Classification  of  Pontics  Based  on  Gingival  Adaptation:  (NOTE: Paragraph 1.64 contains a detailed description of these pontics.) 1.8.2.2.1. Modified ridgelap pontic. 1.8.2.2.2. “Egg” shaped in contact with a residual ridge. 1.8.2.2.3. Hygienic (conventional or modified). 1.8.3. Connectors. A connector is that par t of an FPD that unites a po ntic to a re tainer or jo ins pontics together. Connectors are classified as rigi d (soldered joint) or nonrigid (key-to-keyway arrangements known as semiprecision attachments). The term stress breaker is commonly applied to nonrigid connectors (Figure 1.7). Rigid connectors are by far the most popular option. There are problem situations where a stress-b roken FPD is the restoration of  choice. A stress-broken joint is indicated when there is no common path of insertion for the retainers or when an FPD includes an intermediate abutment.  Figure 1.7. Nonrigid Connector.   1.9. Fixed Splints: 1.9.1. There are ways to m ake a number of teeth  share the load being placed on o ne of the m to help prolong the life of teeth that are loose or have lost supporting bone.  1.9.2. Stabilizing a m obile tooth or teeth is called adjacent, connected castings that have been cemen ted to place in the m outh, it becomes a form of fixed splinting. Such splints are made the same as an FPD. The only difference is that there are no pontics involved.  1.9.3. The overall size of FPDs and fixed splints is expressed in  units. Each replacement tooth or retainer counts as a unit. For example, an FPD with thre e retainers and two pontics has f ive units; a fixed splint with four castings has four units. splinting.

This is a rigid, provisional  restoration that replaces  missing teeth and is generally made from self-curing resin. Its pur pose is to protect cu t tooth surfaces and hold the abutm ent teeth in  position while the definitive FPD is being made.  Section 1C—Fixed Cast Restoration 1.11. Procedural Overview. Production of a fixed cast restoration usually progresses as follows: 1.11.1. The dentist determ ines a patient requires  prosthodontic treatment and m akes preliminary maxillary and mandibular impressions. 1.11.2.

Many f actors can improve the o cclusal and functional stability of natural and prosthodontic teeth. Such factors include: 1.12.1. Balanced Centric Contact. The teeth close into maximum intercuspation (MI) at the end of each swallowing cyObviously, simultaneous and even contact of all st amp cusps must occur at the m oment of closure into MI if  m aximum stability is to  be achieve d. Two f actors that can  prevent balanced centric contact are uneven cusp height and inaccurate cusp placement, as follows: cle. This o ccurs seve ral thousand  tim es each day for most people. 1.12.1.1. Uneven Cusp Height. Uneven cusp height causes overloading and possible da mage AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  21 to teeth that come into contac t sooner or more heavily than others. It  may also cause lightly loaded teeth to overerupt into positions that ups et the cen tric and eccen tric relationships that have been developed. 1.12.1.2.  Inaccurate  Cusp  Placement. Inaccurate cusp  placem ent causes  a hit-and-s lide contact pattern. This can result in  occlusal forces not in line with the long axis, early wear, and instability of the teeth involved. It may also cause the patient to develop the destructive habit of bruxism. 1.12.2. Uniform Centric Contact. All of the posterior teeth contac t exactly at the same time and with uniform pressure when the jaw is closay be either anteroposterior with heavy molar or premolar contact, or cross-arch with one side hitting ahead of the other. In either case, the following adverse conditions could result: ed in MI. Nonuniform contact m the lon g axis, and theref ore 1.12.2.1. Heavy Contact. The teeth in heavy contact would carry all of the pressure and beoverloaded. Such pressures would  probably not be in line with would cause adverse occlusal leverages and forces. 1.12.2.2. Teeth Not In Contact. The teeth not in occlusion w ould tend to erupt into contact, thereby creating occlusal instab ility. Also, as they erupt into occlusion, they may cause a deflected m alocclusion in the excu rsive m ovements, a situation that would create adverse leverages and wear. 1.12.2.3. Involvement of the Temporomandibular Joint. The natural condylar guidance of the temporomandibular joint can  be overpowered by inharmonious  occlusal contacts. This can cause uneven loading and painful and possibly damtemporomandibular joint. aging stress on the tissues of the 1.12.3. Forces Directed In Line With the Long Axis of the Teeth. The uniform centric contacts should be directed in line with the long axis of the teeth from a m echanical leverage standpoint. Ideally, tipped or tilted teeth should be straightened orthodontically. 1.12.4.  Tripodism. For dental pu rposes, tripodism  mean s each cusp co ntact should  be a three-point contact, rather than a single-point, contac t system of occlusion. T he actual cusp  tip should never contact anything at any tim e, any where.  Rather, the ridges around the cusp tip should contact the ridges forming the fossa of the opposing tooth. Tripodism is encouraged as a system of occlusion for use in the fabrication of crowns and FPDs for following reasons: 1.12.4.1. To Establish Stability. Because it is very m uch like a three-legged stool (as opposed to a one-, two-, or four-legged st ool), tripodism is considered to  be a very stable system  of occlusion. 1.12.4.2. To Maintain Stability. Relying on single-point contact s on a prem olar, for example, gives only four connecting points for stability; th at is, two stam p cusps contacting two fossae . Missing only one pair of these contacts causes a significant loss of stability. With tripodism, 12 pinpoint areas of contact are deve loped so a loss of contact be tween one or two pairs does not greatly reduce stability. 1.12.4.3. To Distribute Forces. Tripodism creates m any pinpoint-type contacts rather than a few large areas of contact. Therefore, it produces a better distribution of the applied force. 1.12.4.4. To Avoid a “Locked” Bite. A study of natural, unworn t ooth anatomy indicates cusp ridges are convex. This makes it impossible for the tip of a cusp to contact the center of a fossa  without creating a “locked” bite. The tripod type of contact is one answer to an “unlocked” occlusion. It perm its lateral ex cursive m ovements to be m ade with a m inimum of locking 22  effect. Think of this type of contact as a baintermeshing of precision gears (Figure 1.8). AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 ll-bearing re sting in the f ossa, rathe r than the 1.12.5. Twin Centric Contact (Cross-Tooth Stability). The stamp cusps are the b uccal cusps of the mandibular teeth as they con tact the fossa  of the oppos ing maxillary teeth, and  they are th e lingual cusps of the m axillary teeth as they contact the fossa  of the m andibular. Both groups of stamp cusps m ust occlude even ly and sim ultaneously. This cross-t ooth con tact (o r twin  buccolingual cusp contact) is essential for the following reasons:  Figure 1.8. Avoiding a “Locked” Bite.  1.12.5.1.  It  Improves  the  Stability  of  Tripodism. Twin centric contact is essential tomaintaining the many contact points established by tripodism (Figure 1.9).  Figure 1.9. Centric Contact Points (Closure Stoppers and Equalizers).     1.12.5.2. It Eliminates Damaging Contacts. If the lingual stam p cusp of the m axillary tooth does not contact the central fossa  of the opposing m andibular tooth, the tendency exists for the maxillary to oth to erupt in a tilted pattern until that cusp d oes m ake contact. As s hown in Figure 1.8, the occlusal forces are centered over the long axis of the teeth when the A, B, and C areas are all in contact. If you lose  the B contact, the resulting fo rces of A and C would tend to displace th e m andibular tooth lingu ally o r th e  maxillary to oth bucca lly. If  this  o ccurs, the  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  23 lancing s ide contac t dur ing la teral overerupted lingu al cu sp could  c onstitute a heavy baexcursive movements. The result would be instability and a heavy balancing contact recognized as the most detrimental tooth contact possible (Class II Lever System). 1.12.6.  Closure  Stoppers  and  Equalizers  (Figure  1.10). A, B, and C interocclusal contacts (shown in Figure 1.8) are as also designated as being either closure stoppers or equalizers. Closure stoppers and equalizers stop the closure of the mandible and equalize the forces to p revent buccal or lingual and mesial or distal movement of the posterior teeth, as follows:  Figure 1.10. Location of Closure Stoppers and Equalizers (Sagittal View).   1.12.6.1.  Closure  Stoppers. Closure stoppers stop the hinge closure of the m andible as it centrically relates to the maxilla. They also offset or neutralize the forces exerted by equalizers. Closure stoppers are located on the distal inclines of maxillary posterior teeth and on the mesial inclines of mandibular posterior teeth, primarily on marginal ridges. However, they can also be located on triangular, supplemental, or central ridges. 1.12.6.2.  Equalizers. Equalizers offset (equalize) the gaining mesial-distal stability. Equalizers also  ensure buccal-lingual stability. They are located on the m esial inclines of  m axillary posterio r t eeth and in  the dista l incline s of  m andibular posterior teeth. They are primarily located on triangular, supplemental, and central ridges. Only rarely are they located on marginal ridges. forces exerted by closure stoppers, 1.12.7. Limited Occlusal Table Width. The buccolingual width of prosthodontic teeth, especially of crowns or units of FTDs, m ust  never ex ceed the wid th of the na tural tooth  struc ture th ey replace. In most cases, whether fabricating a he buccolingual width must be made the same width or narrower than the original teeth. This is true for the following reasons: single unit restoration or  a long span FPD, t1.12.7.1. Increased Occlusal Load. Increasing the occlusal tab le width directly increases  the surface area of a crown o r FTD. Increasing the surface area du ring the chewing cycle increases the area of oppositio n to occlus al f orces and adds  directly  to th e func tional load  applied  to abutment teeth. Increasing the functional load puts additional stress on the root system s of AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 abutment teeth. This stress often results in a loss of periodontal support and increasing mobility of the abutment teeth. 1.12.7.2. Forces Not In Line With the Long Axis. Increasing the occlusal width puts occlusal stresses further from the long axis of abutm ent teeth. This increases the  leverage forces felt by the root system  of the abutm ent tooth. It can  also lead to a loss  of periodontal support and mobility of the teeth under stress. 24   Section 1E—Diagnostic Casts, Interim Fixed Prostheses, and Custom Trays 1.13. Preliminary Impressions and Diagnostic Casts: 1.13.1. Because of natural tooth and soft tissue undercuts, elastic impression materials are used for fixed prosthodontic im pressions. I rreversible hydrocollo id (alginate) is the m aterial used for making preliminary impressions. 1.13.2. Diagnostic casts are poured from preliminary impressions made in stock trays. In complete denture and RPD work, diagnostic  casts are used for evaluating th e patient’s problem s and for  constructing a custom tray. A diagnostic cast has additional value in fixed prosthodontic treatment procedures—it is frequently used for making interim (provisional) fixed restorations. 1.13.3.  For a m ore detailed description of the care and pouring of alginate im pressions and trimming specifications of casts, consult the following sections or paragraphs in Volum e 1 of this pamphlet: 1.13.3.1.

Provisional resin restorati ons, made with the indirect method, are routinely constructed for onlay, crown, a nd FPD situations. The diagnostic cast is a m ajor aid in m aking thes e prostheses.  So me technicians th en us e the m ore accurate firs t ca st to m ake th e interim restoration. Once the cast is made, there are a number of ways to either make, or help the dentist make, an interim fixed prosthesis. It is helpful to m ount the cast in a sim ple, fixed-guide articulator that will hold the casts in MI. Index the casts and paint  the bases with separator before mounting them. The  following methods can be used to make interim restorations: 1.14.1.  Vacuum-Forming  Methods. To begin, you m ust have access to a vacuum -forming machine and the proper kind of therm oplastic material (Clear Tem porary Splint Material, 0.020 inch, Buffalo Mfg Co). Then follow the procedures in Method #1 or #2 below: 1.14.1.1. Method #1: 1.14.1.1.1. If the teeth the dentist intends to prep are are broken down, complete a diagnostic wax-up to restore tooth for m and function. Duplicate this wax- up in dental stone and then make a clear matrix for the interim restoration. If the provisional prosthesis is for a proposed FPD site, also adapt m ismatched, uncarded res in denture teeth to the e dentulous space and adjust the occlusion. 1.14.1.1.2. Take the cast off its mounting and vacuum-form the clear splint material over the cast. Cut out the part of the for med plastic th at includes the region of the fixed prosthesis PLUS one or two uninvolved teeth anterior and posterior to it. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  25 1.14.1.1.3.

In f ixed prosthetic dentistry, custom  tray s are used alm ost entirely with elastom eric impression m aterials (F igure 1.13).  For the elastom ers to regist er an impression  accurately and show acceptable elastic behavior, it has to have ad equate thickness. This is why custom  trays are routinely made over spacers.  1.15.2. It is one thing to create space, but quite anot her to maintain it. To guarantee that the tray is being held out of contact with the dentist’s toot h preparations by a m easurement at least equal to the thickness of the spacer, stops are incorporated into the tissue side of the tray. Maxillary custom trays are made with a s ingle, large, palatal stop. Occasionally, however, st ops are placed on tooth surfaces. In the mandibular arch, the occlusal and incisal surfaces of teeth are the only solid places for stops to hit. Such stop contacts are undesirable, but unavoidable. Stops are NE VER placed over teeth the dentist intends to prepare.  1.15.3. Custom trays can be made with self-curing resin, vacuum-forming material (0.125 inch), or light-cured acrylic res in. Because  the dentist has  to ex ert considerable force on  the handle of th e tray, be sure to m ake it strong eno ugh. Mold a nd trim  the custom  tray acco rding to directions  given in Volume 1, Section 7E, but note the following differences in spacer requirements:  28  Figure 1.13. Maxillary and Mandibular Acrylic Resin Custom Trays. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005   1.15.3.1. Self-Curing Acrylic Resin and Light-Cured Trays. Block out facial and lingual soft tissue undercuts with baseplate wax. Adapt two sheets of baseplate wax to cast. Cut the borders of the wax to match the tray’s outline as drawn by the dentist. (See Figure 1.13-D for suggested placement of stops.) Form the tray in self-curing resin. Trim the borders back to d esign and round off the edges. If the wax sp acer is to peel out of a resin  tray cleanly, polymerization has to be com plete and the plastic m ust be cool.  One way to m ake sure wax does not stick to the tissue surface of the tray  is to ad apt tinfoil over the spacer b efore molding the resin. Another way is to substitute a sheet of plastic film for the tinfoil. 1.15.3.2. Vacuum-Forming Trays. The shape and thickness of a maxillary or mandibular arch spacer for a vacuum -forming tray  is  the sam e as  for an  acry lic res in tray. Th e im portant difference is that wet tissue is substituted for the wax. NOTE: Rubber base impressions can be very difficult to remove from the patient’s mouth.  Section 1F—Dies and Working Casts 1.16. Overview: 1.16.1. A  working cast is a cast used to duplicate the patient’s prepared tooth (teeth), the other teeth present in the arch , and all as sociated soft tissue structures. It is us ed to establish the shape,  proximal contacts, occlusion, and fit of fixed prostheses, from  the simplest inlay to the m ost complicated complete mouth rehabilitation.  1.16.2. A die is a positive reproduction of the prepared portion of a tooth in a hard, stable m aterial such as im proved stone, dental am algam, acrylic  resin, epoxy resin, or el ectrodeposits of m etal. Dies are co mposed of two parts,1.14). By itself, a die has lim ited value until its re lationship with adjacent and opposing teeth is  established.  tooth and an extension (Figure  th e duplicate of the prepared  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 1.14. Improved Stone Die Made From a Tube Impression. 29   1.16.3. A working cast contains one or more dies. Dies are either part of a working cast or they are not. For those dies that are not,  the extension is a conve nient grip and nothing  more. Dies that are part of a working cast are frequently made to be removable, and their extensions are keyed in some manner. Because of the key, the die will not rotate and it can be placed back in the cast in the same position after every removal. Dies can be keyed in  a variety of ways; for example, carve facets on the extension or m ake the extens ion from a commercially available, m etal dowel p in (paragraph 1.20.2). 1.17. Individual Dies Made From Tube Impressions: 1.17.1. The dentist has access to a st ock of short m etal tubes or bands that are m ade from copper or aluminum. He or she can use these bands as miniature trays to make impressions of single teeth. Rubber base and modeling plastic are the impression materials most often employed. Dies derived from tube impressions can be keyed and subsequently inc orporated in to a workin g cast. Tub e impressions are most frequently poured in improved stone. 1.17.2. Because tubes made from  copper or alu minum bend easily, th e tube impression should be handled gently. Rinse the im pression with room te mperature water to rid it of saliva and debris and dry it with gentle blasts of compressed air. 1.17.3. “Box” the rim  of the band with 28-gauge material should be wide enough to produce an exte nsion that is 2.5 centimeters (cm) long after the impression is poured. When using wax, seal the “box”  at the side lap and at the junction with the band. Be careful not to heat the impression material. 1.17.4. Mix a sufficient volume of die stone according to the manufacturer’s directions. The water-to-powder ratio and the  manner of spatulation will determine the hardness, density, and su rface smoothness of the stone. W hen possible, use vacuum spatulation and mix the stone from 10 to 15 seconds. Avoid lengthy mixing because it causes the stone to set very rapidly. 1.17.5. Gently vibrate a small amount of the mix into the boxed impression until the deep parts are filled. Without trapping air, add m ore of the m ix until the b ox is filled. Let the ston e reach fina l set. 1.17.6. If the im pression is made of nonelastic modeling compound, place the im pression and die oF for 3 to 5 m inutes. W hen the m odeling com pound stone assembly in warm  water at 140 sheet wax or cellophane tape. The boxing 30  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 becomes soft, extract the die.  Failure to wait until the m odeling compound softens m ay result in unacceptable die abrasion or outrig ht breakage. If  you are using an elastic m aterial to m ake the impression, extract the die without applying heat to the impression material. 1.17.7. Trim the die’s extension to a sm ooth even taper. If the die is going to becom e a removable die in a wor king cast, cut at le ast one flat facet on the exte nsion portion to ac t as a key (Figu re 1.14). 1.18. Removable Die Systems. There are a great variety of rem ovable die systems; some are good and others are poor. Besides ease ofconvenient handling, the overriding requirement is that dies , once rem oved, have to go back to exactly th e sam e place. Dies that do notsatisfy this requirem ent have greatly dim inished  value. Paragraphs 1.19 through 1.26 describe these systems in detail. 1.19. Dowel Pin Systems:  fabrication and subsequent  1.19.1. A working cast can be m ade with removable stone dies by pouring the arch portion of an impression first and then pouring the rest of th e working cast around commerc ially fabricated die extensions (dowel pins).  1.19.2. One of the improved stones is used for both pours. Occasionally, the technician reproduces the den tition and p repared teeth  in  a work ing cast,  using  electrically depos ited s ilver or epo xy resin. He or she then com pletes the cast, us ing im proved stone and one of the conventional pinning techniques.  1.19.3. Keyed and tapered m etal dowel pins with serra ted heads are used as die extensions. Dies  having these keyed dowel pin extensions will travel to place and seat in a working cast in only one way. Dowel pins can b e placed in any kind of imp ression. The differences in techn ique focus on two points: (1) the way the dowel pins are held in  position while the first pour of stone is setting, and (2) the way separation between the die and working cast is achieved.  1.19.4. Tooth preparation sites (dies)  are not the only areas of an arch that are m ade removable with dowel pins. It is very common practice toremovable. Contact areas on finished castings are  better evaluated when this is done. Som etimes,  is to m ake adjacent  teeth removable, to o. the only  way a die w ill com e out of the base pourMaking the edentulous ridge between two abutments removable has definite advantages in shaping and finishing FPD pontics.  1.19.5. A final im pression for a fixed prosthesis m ay be  m ade from elastom eric m aterial or reversible hydrocolloid. Im pressions m ade with  elastomeric im pression m aterials have several  advantages over those m ade with hydrocolloi d. Elastom ers are much less susceptible to temperature and humidity changes, and they ar e stronger than hydrocolloid. Two successive casts from the sam e elastomeric impression may be poured  to m ake the second ca st a duplicate of the first. However, if the impression is being m ade from reversible hydrocolloid, another im pression will have to be made to pour a second cast. 1.19.6. See paragraphs 1.20 through  1.24 for various techniques and  methods pertaining to this system.  m ake the unaltered teeth next to the dies 1.20. Saw-Out Technique for Elastomeric Impressions. This technique is shown below and in Figure 1.15:  1.20.1. Rinse the rubber base final  impression in room temperature water to flush away saliva and debris. Disinfect and carefully dry the impression with a gentle stream of air. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 1.15. Dowel Pin Removable Dies (Saw-Out Technique). 31   1.20.2. Above each preparation site and ad jacent unprepared tooth (teeth), drive two straight pin s from the buccal flang e through to th e lingual aspect of the impression. The distance between the  straight pins should be a little greater than the  width of a dowel pin. The thinner an d sharper th e straight pins, the lesser the chances of distorting the impression. The 28-gauge disposable injection needles work best (Figure 1.15-A). 1.20.3. Position a dowel pin between a set of two straight pins and centered  above the cervical margin of the preparation site or tooth imprint, flat side to the distal and long axis of the dowel pin parallel to the long axis of the tooth’s root. Besides being as parallel as possible to the long axis of the tooth’s root, the dowel pin s placed in ad jacent areas sho uld parallel each other. Neatly sticky wax the dowel pins to the straight pins. NOTE: A variation of this method is where the dowel pins are held in  place by comm ercially availab le p lastic tub ing bridged a cross vertically oriented straight pins. Dowel pins can also be held in place with bobby pins fastened to the impression with straight pins and sticky wax (Figure 1.15-A). 1.20.4. Pour the im pression in two steps (stages). Th e first stage takes in the tooth preparations, unaltered teeth, and edentulous ar eas (Figure 1.15-B and -C ). Pour the second stage on top of the first and form the base of the cast (Figure 1.15-D). To prevent entrapment of air bubbles caused by the surface tension of the dental stone, use a wetting agent on the impression before flowing in the first stage.  1.20.5. Vacuum spatulate the d ie stone acco rding to  the manufacturer’s directions.  Starting in a heel area, vibrate the stone into the impression and  make it run to the opposite side. Be careful not to trap bubbles. The depth of the  first pour should come to a level  slightly below the straight pins and sticky wax. Embed staples (washers, paper clips) into all segments of the first pour that are not NOTE: Polysilox ane programmed to be removable; that impression materials are extrem ely hydrophobic. Be fore pouring the impression, ensure that no moisture has collected in crevices, blocking out the fine detail. 1.20.6. After the first pour ha s reached final set, remove the straight pins and clean the sticky wax from around the dowel pins. At th e place where the dowel pin ente rs the first pour , cut away the is, any part without a dowel pin. 32  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 flash of stone and create a butt junction. Cut two he mispherical indexing dimples into the base of each doweled part, one buccal and one lingual to  the dowel pin. Use a #8 round bur.  Do not sink the bur into the stone further than one-half the diameter of the bur head. 1.20.7. Apply a separator to the bases  of the parts that contain dowel  pins. If this is not done, the areas in th e first stage that are prog rammed to be rem ovable will not s eparate cleanly from the second stage. 1.20.8. Moisten the surface of the first pour and proceed to build a stone base for the working cast. Stack the stone to reach near the tips of the dowel pins without actual ly burying them . Do not  attach balls of wax or clay to th e dowel pin tips to act as p in locators. If wax or cl ay residues find their way into a dowel pinhole, a removable die will not seat. A better option is to place red plastic covers on the tips of the dowel pins (Figure 1.15-C and -D). Such covers are part of the “placement kit, tooth ” previous ly mentioned. If  the plastic covers or s omething sim ilar are not  available, do not use anything.  1.20.9. Next, place retention nodules ont o the stone surface so the wo rking cast stays  attached to an articulator mounting ring when mounting time comes (Figure 1.15-D). Place the handle of the set, im pression side up.  NOTE: Casts sent to tray into  an  approp riate holder and let the stone another laboratory for appliance fabrication must have smooth bases so they can be separated from their mountings and returned with the finished restoration. 1.20.10. Wait until the second pour reaches final set  and separate the cast from the i mpressions (Figure 1.15-E).  NOTE: Polyether impression m aterials are ve ry stiff, m aking separation of the cast from impressions difficult. 1.20.11. Next, trim the cast. The slush that splashes  off a trimming wheel can  ruin a working cast. If precautions are not taken, debris will cling to cast surfaces, making them rough and inaccurate. Before trimming a cast, soak it in SDS for about a minute. The slush will have fewer tendencies to stick. As addition al protection, cover the cast’s arch  form with wet tissu e paper. After trimm ing the cast, rinse it thoroughly in SDS. Blow it dry and set it aside for 30 minutes. 1.20.12. Clear any stone away from the tops of the  pins, ensuring about 2 mm is exposed to view. If covers were used, remove them. 1.20.13. Before dies are sawed and tapped out for the first time, accurately seat the working cast in a jaw relationship record (Figure 1.15-F) and mount the working cast  in an articulator (according to cast mounting procedures in Section 1G). Then proceed to the next step in the current process. 1.20.14. Using a flat-bladed die saw or fine-bladed coping saw, extend cuts from the gingival crest areas mesial and distal to a preparation or dowel ed tooth, down to the junction be tween the f irst and second pours of the working cast. If a die does not have other rem ovable segments adjacent to it, the two saw cuts should converge toward the   there are a num ber of consecutive dies and doweled teeth  present, the most mesial and most distal cuts should converge  toward the  base of  the  cast and a ll in termediate cuts should bisect the ang le m ade by the converging outer cuts (Figure 1.15-G). 1.20.15. With the cast held low over a table and crad led in the palm of the hand, exert downward pressure on the tip of a dowel pi n with an flat instrum ent. The doweled area should pop loose. NOTE: Ne ver saw out dies or doweled teeth and pop them loose before the cast trimm ing procedure is done. Once rem oved, a die will not return to  place if slurry f rom the trimming wheel gets into the dowel pinholes. 1.20.16. The next step is to trim the dies (paragraph 1.33.1). base of the cast.

Review the procedures desc ribed in paragraph 1.20 for obt aining rem ovable dies and a  working cast from  an elastom eric impression by  the saw-out technique. This m ethod is alm ost identical. It only differs in the way dowel pins are positioned because reversible hydrocolloid does not retain straight pins well, is weak, and splits easily. 1.21.2. Certain ingredients in som e reversible hydr ocolloid im pression m aterials detrim entally affect the s urface hard ness of dental simpression in a 2 percent solution of potassium sulfate for about 5 minutes before continuing. This is called “fixing.” 1.21.3. Using an indelible pencil, make marks buccal and lingual to preparation sites and adjacent teeth. The m arks should be up hi gh enough to still be visible afte r the first stage of the working cast has been poured. 1.21.4. Place a dowel pin in a bobby pin. The intent is  for the dowel pin to hang into a preparation site or adjacent tooth imprint while suspended from the bobby pin. The buccal and lingual walls of the impression support the bobby pin. Align the dowel  pins in the areas selected according to the  manner described for rubber-base impressions. Sticky-wax the dowel pin to the bobby pin and lay the assembly aside. 1.21.5. Pour the first stage of the working cast. Using the indelible penc il m arks as guides, position the dowel pin or bobby pin assem blies in thei r proper places. A dowel pin is parallel to the long axis of a tooth and multiple and consecutive dowel pins are parallel to each other. 1.21.6. Let the stone of the first stag e reach final set. Remove the bobby pins and clean the stick y wax from the dowel pins. Prepare butt junctions where the dowel pins enter the first stage. 1.22.  Matrix  Band  Shim  Method. A saw can not be used  to full adv antage in an  interproximal area where the p reparations are too  clos e to  each other or to ad jacent teeth.  The  shim  method  of  making removable dies is helpful in these kinds of cases (Figure 1.16). Two-thousandt hs (2/1000) of an inch matrix band  m aterial can be used  to separate ad jacent dies  from  each other and from  the rest of the  dental arch in the first stage pour . After the second stage pour has se t, the rem ove metal shims, which should almost eliminate the need for sawing. The m atrix band m aterial is avai lable in 5/16- and 7/16-inch widths. Use the width that works best for a given situation.  Figure 1.16. Dowel Pin Removable Dies (Shim Method).    34  1.22.1. Rubber-Base Impressions: AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 1.22.1.1. Cut trapezoid-shaped shim s (dividers) from 2/1000 of an in ch stainless steel m atrix band material. Place these shim s mesially and distally  to a toot h preparation site or adjacent tooth im print. Use only one shim in each interproxim al area. The s hims, together with th e sidewalls of the im pressions, will form a “box” around each area of interest. Shape each shim to conform to the facial, lingual, and gingival contours of the impression without quite touching them. Be sure to allow about 1 mm of space  between the impression of the proxi mal gingival crests and the band material. Lay aside the cut shims in their proper sequence to help in placing them accurately. 1.22.1.2. Carefully apply a 1 or 2 mm thickness of u tility wax to the facial and lingu al aspects of the im pression above the im prints of prepared  and ad jacent teeth. Warm a shim  in an open  flame sufficient for it to melt the utility wax and go to place easily. Converge the shims apically on an isolated abutment. For multiple, adjacent doweled areas, the most mesial and distal shims in the segment should converge ap ically. All interm ediate shims should bisect the angle m ade by the converging outer shims. 1.22.1.3. Position the do wel pins by using the stra ight pin or bobby pin m ethods described in  paragraph 1.20.  NOTE:  Some technicians place dowel pins” immediately after the first stage has been poured. This method can be used successfully, but the technician has minimum control over dowel pin alignment. 1.22.1.4. Minimize entrapment of air bubbles by us ing a surface tension reducing agent over the rubber base m aterial. Pour  a v acuum spatulated  m ix of die  stone into  the  im pression to  produce the working cast’s first stage. Leave about 0.5 mm of the shim  tops visible. If the dowel pins  were not previously position ed with  str aight pins, a lign them  now. Provide mechanical retention in all segm ents of the first stage not destined to be removable. Use small washers, wire loops, or small nodules of stone. 1.22.1.5. After final set of the first stage, drill sm all indexing  depressions to the buccal and lingual of a dowel pin with a #8 round bur. Paint a separator onto the bases of the doweled parts and pour the second stag e of the working cast as previously described in paragraphs 1.20.8 through 1.20.10. Do not bury the ends of the dowel pins. 1.22.1.6. Trim  the wor king cast, taking care not toworking cast and its opponent in an articulator (Section 1G). 1.22.1.7. Using a #0000 jeweler saw blade, carefully cut from  a proxim al gingival crest down to the shim. Remove each doweled part by pressing on the dowe l pin and popping it out. To do this successfully, first  expose the buccal, lingual, and gingiv al edges of the shim s with a #25 knife blade.  get stone slush all over it. Mount the  in soft stone “freehand1.22.2. Reversible Hydrocolloid Impressions: 1.22.2.1. Subm erge reversible hydr ocolloid impressions in a 2 solution for about 5 minutes. This improves the surface hardness of the set stone. 1.22.2.2. In a rubber-base im pression, undersized shim s were waxed to place.

The Pindex instrument or similar drilling device simplifies paralleling and centering dowel pins for removable stone dies made in elastomeric or hydrocolloid impressions (Figure 1.17). This technique is useful when it is m ore advantageous to pin the die after the first pour is com plete. Such is the case in a difficult-to -pin hydrocolloid impression or when an epoxy resin technique of  cast construction is used. 1.23.2. Make the first stage pour sufficiently thick—at least 15 mm  from  the bottom  to the marginal extension. Carefully remove the arch from the impression and trim the base against a cast trimmer to create a flat surf ace (Figure 1.17-A). The finished fi rst stage pour should be 15 mm  from the base to m arginal extension. The first st age pour should be slightly dam p before drilling the pinholes (Figure 1.17-B). 1.23.3. Using a pencil, p lot each pin hole location on the surface of the first s tage pour. Drill  two holes, one buccal and the other lingual, centered on each prepared posterior tooth (Figure 1.17-C). Ensure the holes are far enough apar t that they won’t inte rfere with seating of the plastic sleeves that cover each pin. Drill one hole lingual to each prepared anterior tooth. Drill individual pinholes in adjacent areas that w ill be rem ovable or used for placing reten tive devices. After all ho les are drilled, use compressed air to clean any debris from the holes. 1.23.4. Select the proper pin for each location and cement it in place with cyanoacrylate glu e (Figure 1.17-D). Place the corres ponding plastic or m etal sleeve  over the m etal pin (Figure 1.17-E). Regular brass dowel pins with the tapered end  bent over can be used for retention areas. Use the dual pin with corresponding m etal sleeves for anterior s to com pensate for narrow arch sizes. Use this pin  without th e metal sleeve if space is  limited. When using th e dual pin, m ake a s mall indexing notch lingual to each hole  with a separating d isc. Use the  long pin with a white pla stic sleeve as a dowel pin  for posterior teeth. Use the  short pin and gray sleeve with th e long pins for indexing the die. 1.23.5. Paint a separator on the base of all areas you intend to saw out. Before constructing the second stage, place a strip of utility  wax over the  pin extensions to access the p ins and to close over the opening of the gray sleeves. Bead and box the first pour with wax or use the rubber molds to form the base. Moisten the surface of the first pour before filling the mold to form the base. Be sure to flow stone in  and around the sleeves before  inverting the arch into  the stone-filled base mold (Figure 1.17-F and -G). 1.23.6. Trim the cast and section the dies as previously described (Figure 1.17-H through -J). 1.24. Silver-Plating Polysulfide and Silicone Impressions: or su rface detail. These advan1.24.1.

NOTE: Tox ic fumes produced by the silver cyanide solution ar e extremely dangerous. Use the solution under an exhaust hood. Although it is possible to silver-plate silicone im pressions, distortion can be a  problem. Do not attempt to plate polyether impressions. 1.24.2. Thoroughly clean and dry the impression because the metalizing powder will not adhere to wet surfaces and tends to collect in corners. 1.24.3. Insert the cathode wire through the impression in the buccal sulcus area and fix it firmly in place to prevent twisting and loss of contact with the impression material.  36  Figure 1.17.

Avoid excess pools of silver powder in the impression and ensure the wire m akes contact with the p owder. Pay close attention to undercut areas, m aking sure they are adequate ly covered. Dust away  all surplus powder and  37 AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  lightly dry the impression with compressed air. Y ou may also use commercially available aerosol silver sprays. 1.24.5. Fill the preparations and the teeth with th e electrolytic solution by using an eyedropper to prevent air bubbles and resulting voids. 1.24.6. Completely submerge the impression in the plating solution. Attach the cathode wire to the negative side of the unit and connect the anode of  pure silver to the po sitive side. Switch on the plating unit and adjust the outpu t for a com plete arch im pression to approxim ately 150 (m A) or less for smaller sections. After 1 ho ur of plating, inspect the impression and even deposition of metal to ensure there are no voids. If voids are pr esent, remetalize those areas with silver powder and resume plating. 1.24.7. Remove the plated im pression after approximately 15 hours and wash it thoroughly under running water. Dry the impression, using compressed air. 1.24.8. Pin and pour the impression as you normally would. 1.25.  Removable  Dies  and  a  Working  Cast  Made  From  a  Combination  of  a  Tube  Impression, Transfer Copings, and a Tray Impression. Individual dies made from plastic tube impressions can be changed into rem ovable dies in a working cast by using transfer copings  and a tray im pression. Although this technique is tim e-consuming and has  more potential f or error than with dowel pin systems. It continues to  persis t because it is o ccasionally im possible to  make an im pression of the prepared teeth in a tray. doubts about how accurately the die is seated or 1.25.1. Making Dies From a Tube Impression. Take the tube im pression and construct a dental stone die. Have the dentist trim the margins of the die. Taper and key the die’s extension. 1.25.2. Making Dies From Transfer Copings. An individual die cannot  be inserted into a tr ay impression made from an elas tic material with fu ll confidence that the  die is cor rectly related to the rest of the dental arch. There are always whether the weight of the die is m aking it lean fro m its proper orientation. Transfer copings help to resolve most of the doubts. A  coping is a thin, shell-like cap fabricated over a die of a complete om m etal or m ade from a resin like  Dura  Lay® crown preparation. A coping can be cast fr(Reliance Dental Mfg Co, W orth, IL).  This metal or plastic cap becomes a  transfer coping when used for seating an individual die in an im pression tray with greate r accuracy. M etal copings are thought to give better results than  the plastic variety, bu t plastic copings are  much easier to m ake and work well enough for simple cases, as follows: 1.25.2.1. Apply a tinfoil substitute to a stone die. 1.25.2.2. Use the  brush  technique  to build up a Dura Laytechnique consists of adding in crements of resin polym er with a brush and using the sa me brush to wet each polymer increment with monomer. NOTE: Because acrylic resin shrinks as it polymerizes, a circumferential coping m ade as   a single unit tends to lock onto the die. To minimize this tendency, build the coping in halves  down to the die m argin. For example, apply the facial half and let it polym erize before  layering on the lingual portion. Be sure the resin layer is uniform and sufficiently thick to be rigid. 1.25.2.3. Take the coping off the die and cut itsmargin. Carefully cut a sm all “window” into the coping’s f acioincisal edge. Place the coping back on the die. Look into the window and make sure it seats. Attach resin spurs to the coping’s facial and lingual surfaces well above the plastic margin. Store the completed coping on its die.  gingival m argin 0.5 mm short of the die ®  coping on the die.

Note that the dentist places the copingspatient’s mouth and looks into the windows to check the copings for fit. Next, the dentist might make a plaster index to encase all of the copings as a unit. To relate this a ssembly to the rest of the dental arch, the dentist will make a complete arch alginate impression over the index while it is se ated in the  mouth. NOTE: The impression received will h ave copings embedded in a plaster index which, in turn, will be embedded in an alginate impression. 1.25.2.5. Apply separating m edium to any exposed  plaster in the im pression and seat the tapered, keyed, individual dies  into the cop ings. Seal each die  in position by flowing a little baseplate w ax around the die’s junction with the im pression. Further stabilize the die by extending a common straight pin from facial lingual across the ridge area and seal the die to the pin with sticky wax. 1.25.2.6. Lubricate the extension  of each d ie. Pour the cast, leaving abou t 2 mm of the tip s of the dies exposed. Place retention nodules on the top of the soft stone  so the cast can be retained on a mounting ring without difficulty. 1.25.2.7. Separate the cast from the im pression. Trim the cast, m ount the cast against the opposing arch in an articulator, and pop the dies loose. 1.26.  Solid  Working  Casts. A solid working cast can be a great prostheses. Following are two methods for fabricating solid casts and their use in the laboratory: asset in the fabrication of fixed 1.26.1. Solid Working Cast With Augmenting Individual Dies (Figure 1.18): 1.26.1.1. Some dentists prefer to use a solid work ing cast (no rem ovable dies) to develop the occlusal surfaces and th e proximal, buccal, and  lingual contours of wax pa tterns. The patterns are then transferred to individu al d ies for co mpletion of  the m argins. A working cast with augmenting individual dies can be  made by pouring a rubber base impression twice; first, to pour the dies of the individual abutm ents, and s econd, to pour the cast.  Do not use reversible hydrocolloid impressions because the material is susceptible to change. 1.26.1.2. Before pouring the dies, “box” the imprint of each abutment with matrix band strips to confine the die material. An alternative is to pour a sectional or partial cast that includes several dies and saw the dies apart later. Add enough die material to form an extension that is adequate for easy handling of the die. Allow this first pour to set for 45 minutes. 1.26.1.3. Remove the first pour from  the im pression and set it aside where it will not be damaged. Before repouring the im pression, wax  a ring of boxing wax around the top of each abutment margin. This ring will ex pose the m argin so the wax pattern  can be m ade and the  casting can be seated on the cast. Immediatel y repour the impression to construct a com plete, solid working cast. 1.26.1.4. After removing the working cast from the impression, trim it on a cast trimmer and let the cast dry.  Use this cast to estab lish the occlus al form, proximal contacts, and occlusal two-thirds of the axial contours of the wax patterns. Use the trimmed individual dies to complete the final adaptation of the wax pattern margins. 1.26.1.5. Using this technique, m ake a single-pie ce die for FPDs (Figure 1.19). Leave the die for each abutment joined to the other by a comm on base. Because the d ies are never separated  from each o ther, greater accuracy  can be expected. Pour the invol ved part of th e arch and die stone for an adequate base. W hen trimm ing  the one-piece die, be sure to cut back th e edentulous ridge area, allowing good access for cont ouring the interproximals and for finishing the margins. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 1.18. Solid Working Cast With Augmenting Individual Dies. 39  Figure 1.19. One-Piece Die for an FPD.    1.26.2.  Solid  Working  Cast  With  Dowel  Pinned  Cast. T he extrem e stab ility of polyvinylsiloxane impression material allows the production of multiple and nearly identical casts from one impression. For fixed pr osthodontics, it is most useful to have one pinned and sectioned cast (paragraph 1.19) and one “solid ” cast. These two casts allow  the production of an extrem ely accurate prostheses.  Section 1G—Cast-Mounting Procedures  1.27.  Overview.  The most convenient tim e to unseat a rem ovable die for the first tim e is before mounting the working cast. You have m aximum access to  the tips of the die exten sions. However, th e best time to m ount a cast is before the first releas e of re movable dies from  their seats. A working cast has a better chance of fitting agains t an opposing cast or into a jaw relationship record with the greatest possible accuracy. The accuracy of the m ounting is  the prim ary consideration.  The problem  then becomes one of providing access to the tips of die extensions in the working cast’s mounting. 1.28. Die Extension Access: 1.28.1. Cover the tips o f the extensions with an y type of tape that sticks to damp surfaces (Figure 1.17-I). 1.28.2. Place a m ound of clay on top of  the tape and shape it so th e stone used in m ounting the cast will not block direct access to the extension tips (Figure 1.17-J). 40  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 1.28.3. Mount the maxillary cast with facebow (Figures 1.17-K and -L). 1.28.4. Mount the mandibular cast (Figure 1.17-M). 1.28.5. Peel out the clay and tape after the stone sets (Figure 1.17-M). 1.28.6. Pop loose the dies and all other removable areas of the cast (Figure 1.17-N). 1.29. Mounting the Maxillary Cast: 1.29.1. Average Method. See Volume 1, paragraph 6.12. 1.29.2.  Facebow  Transfer. An occlusion rim  is part of the facebow transfer ap paratus for an edentulous or nearly edentulous maxillary arch. In fixed prosthodontic cases, a significant number of maxillary teeth are us ually present and an occ lusion rim is not of ten used. Instea d, the dentis t will cov er the facebow’s bite fork with a un iform thickn ess of base plate wax or m odeling compound. The dentist will warm the material and impresses it against the maxillary teeth, picking up a series of incisal ed ge and occlusal surface  indentations. After the f acebow transfer has been sent to the laboratory, set the maxillary cast in the indentations when the  facebow is being related to the articulator as follows: 1.29.2.1. Hanau H2 Articulator. See the description in Volu me 1, paragraph 7.47.2) The only difference in the description is that the occlusal plane form ed by stone teeth (instead of the  plane of an occlusion rim) is oriented parallel to the base of the articulator. 1.29.2.2. Whip-Mix Articulator: 1.29.2.2.1. Prepare the Articulator for the Cast-Mounting Procedure: 1.29.2.2.1.1. The lower frame of the articulator has the letters L (large), M (medium), and S (s mall) engraved on each of its corners on the back side. Screw the two condylar elements into the setting that corresponds with  the patient’s condylar width of L, M, or S as recorded on the front of the facebow by the dentist.  1.29.2.2.1.2. Tighten the condylar elements firmly in place with the box wrench. Then set the upper frame of the articulator to the same width of L, M, or S by re moving or adding the correct number of spacers on the shafts of the condylar guides.  1.29.2.2.1.3. Use two spacers on each shaft for L, one on each shaft for M, and none for S. Make su re th e shafts are rep laced so th e s pacers are in tigh t con tact on bo th sides  between the articu lator frame and the condylar  guides. W hen spaces are using spacers,  always place those with the beveled sectionsbevels next to the guides. Also be sure the  horizontal line on each spacer aligns with the one on the back of the condylar guide.  1.29.2.2.1.4. Spacers are not interch angeable between articulators. When spacers are not in use, place them on the incisal guide pin so they stay with  the same instrument. Set the condylar gu ides at a 3 0-degree angulation  in preparation for attach ing the facebow assembly. The side shif t guide settings are i rrelevant at this tim e.

Be sure the 1.29.2.2.2. Secure the Facebow to the Upper Frame: 1.29.2.2.2.1. The W hip-Mix faceb ow is m ost convenien tly used  with a W hip-Mix articulator. The facebo w is de signed so neither side arm  can be m oved laterally without AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  41 the other arm m oving a  correspond ing distance . The facebow is attach ed to the u pper frame of th e articulator by placing  the ho les in the m edial side of the plastic earp ieces over the pins provided on the outside flange of the condylar guides.  1.29.2.2.2.2. Remove the plastic nasion  relator and its bracket fr om the crossbar of the facebow and loosen the three thumb screws slightly. To secure the facebow in place, hold it in one hand and with the other and lift off the upper member of the articulator.  1.29.2.2.2.3. While holding one arm of the facebow against your body, guide first one pin and then the other onto the outer flanges of  the condylar guides and in to the holes on the medial side of the p lastic earp ieces. Allow  the anterio r end of the u pper fram e of the articulator to rest on the crossbar of the f acebow and then tighten the three thum b screws while still pressing the facebow arms firmly against your body.  1.29.2.2.2.4. Replace th e upper fram e with attach ed faceb ow onto th e lower fram e, allowing the fork toggle of the facebow to rest on the incisal guide table. 1.29.2.2.3. Mount the Maxillary Cast: 1.29.2.2.3.1. Seat the cast in the face bow fork registration. Then lift the upper arm of the articulator and apply a mound of well-mixed stone to the base of the cast. Using one hand for support to prevent an y movement of the facebow fork or cast, close th e upper arm of the articulator until it again touch es the cr ossbar of the facebow , sinking the m ounting plate into the soft mounting stone. Hold the cast in position until the mounting stone has set and then remove the facebow from the articulator. 1.29.2.2.3.2. W hen a fa cebow transfer is m ade to  a W hip-Mix articulator, expect the occlusal plane to have an anterior tilt warticulator. If the occlusal plane and the articulator’s horizontal plane happen to coincide, it is pure chance. ith reference to the horizontal plane of the 1.30. Mounting the Mandibular Cast: 1.30.1. Mounting at the Patient’s Actual or Estimated Occlusal Vertical Dimension. This is characteristic of two kinds of cast relating m ethods, dentulous casts fitted together in MI and occlusion rim -jaw relationship records. Follow mounting: the pin-f lush ru le b elow with this kind o f 1.30.1.1. Mount the upper cast by the average or the facebow transfer method. Mount the upper cast while the incisal guide pin is flush with th e upper member of the articulator. In the W hip-Mix facebow transfer procedure, remove the pin before placing the face bow on the articulator. After facebow m ounting of the m axillary cast is finished, repla ce the incis al guide pin (pin -flush). 1.30.1.2. Lock the condylar elements down in the most retruded position. The Hanau articulator has centric locks to a ccomplish this. On the W hip-Mix articulator, set the side sh ift guide on each side in  an extrem e negative po sition and outwa rd as far as possib le. While this will lock  the condyles in a retrud ed position, be careful not  to force the articulator into an overopened  position because the instrument could be seriously damaged. 1.30.1.3. Invert the articulator. 1.30.1.4. Place opposin g dentulou s casts in th e best  MI possible or position casts in anocclusion rim record, if provided. 1.30.1.5. Stabilize the assembly with wires and modeling plastic.  42  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 1.30.1.6. Apply a m ound of stone to the base of the  lower cast and close the  articulator into it. The condyle elements should be in their most retruded positions in the condyle guides. 1.30.2.  Mounting  at  a  Vertical  Dimension  Other  Than  the  Patient’s  Actual  or  Estimated Occlusal Vertical Dimension:  1.30.2.1. This condition is characteristic of m ountings made with interocclusal jaw relationship records. An   interocclusal  record  is one that has been m ade between the teeth of opposing arches. Interocclusal records are m ade in diffe rent ways. S ome are m ade from  wa x wafers, others are made from zinc oxide and eugenol paste carried into the mouth on a perforated metal plate, and still others are made with zinc oxide and eugenol paste supported by gauze held in a frame.  thickness. Because they  1.30.2.2. The one thing all interocclusa l records have in common is have thickness, they usually hold opposing teet h apart at a vertical dimension that is open from the patient’s occlusal vertical dimension. It is common practice to compensate for the thickness of an interocclusal record before the lower cast is attached to its mounting ring. 1.30.2.3. Mount the maxillary cast with a facebow tr ansfer supplied by the  dentist. The thicker the interocclusal record, the greater the need for a facebow transfer. Opposing casts mounted at an open vertical dim ension without benefit of  a facebow transfer will  be inaccurately related when the articulator is subsequently closed to the patient’s actual or estim ated occlusal vertical dimension. 1.30.2.4. Make an es timate of how thick the reco rd is. Using the p in-flush pos ition as the starting point, open the vertical dimension accordingly. The range of compensation varies from about 1 mm for a gauze-supported r ecord to 5 mm for a record m ade with wax or with m etal plates. 1.30.2.5. Invert the articulator and position the interocclusal record on the teeth of the maxillary cast. Place the teeth of  the m andibular cast in their corres ponding indentations. Stabilize the assembly with wires and m odeling plastic.  A good interocclusal record will show the indentations of incisal edges and the cusp tips of posterior teeth, but no more. Records showing more than the requirements have to be trimmed with the sharpest k nife possible until on ly incisal edges and cusp tips are v isible. It is  unacceptable practice to force a cas t into a reco rd that laps onto the facial or li ngual surfaces of teeth. There is a  strong possibility the record will warp. There is no way of determining whether the cast is fully seated in the record. 1.30.2.6. Mount the mandibular cast.  After it has been mounted, remove the interocclusal record. Decrease the vertical dim ension to  th e pa tient’s actual or es timated o cclusal vertical  dimension. Make a note of the final pin setting on the upper cast’s stone mounting. 1.31. Semiadjustable Articulator Settings (Hanau H2 and Whip-Mix): 1.31.1. Average Method: 1.31.1.1. Note that the occlusal plane is parallel to the horizontal plane of the articulator. 1.31.1.2. Remember, the scale should read “+30 o.” If, for som e reason, the occlusal plane has not been mounted parallel to the horizontal plan e of the articulator, set the horizontal condylar guidance other than +30 o to com pensate for the am ount of deviation (Volum e 1, Chapter 6). For example, many dentists like to use a facebow transfer with average settings on a Whip-Mix articulator. The occlusal plane will r arely come out parallel to the articulator’s horizontal plane after a W hip-Mix facebow transfer. Expect a positiv e deviation of about 10 to 15 degrees.

Note that lateral condylar guidance equals 15 degrees. 1.31.1.4. Set the incisal guide determining the occlusion scheme for the prosthesis. 1.31.1.5.

Use a protrusive jaw relationship record  to set the horizontal condylar guidance. First, mount the maxillary and mandibular casts in the centric position (centric relation, MI) the dentist wants. Then, loos en the horizontal condylar guid ance lockscrews. The guidances should rotate freely within their housings.

W ith the upper fra me and its cast Raise the incisal guide pin toinverted, carefully seat the left lateral excursion interocclusal r ecord on the upper cast. Holding the upper fram e in one hand and the lo wer fram e in the other, place the left condylar element in the left condylar guide. Gently seat the lower cast into the indents of the lateral record and lightly hold the articulator and casts in position with one hand.  1.31.2.2.4. Notice in Figure 1.20-B that the right condylar elem ent has m oved away from both the superior and posterior surfaces of the condylar guide and, in most cases, toward the median line. To set the inclination of this right guide, loosen its holding screw and rotate the guide toward the condylar element until contact is established. It is advisable that contact be ondylar guides at zero 44  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 judged by sight, rather than by depending on the  sense of touch (Figure 1.20-C). This helps to ensure that the casts are not f orced out of position from the interocclusal record. Tighten the locking screw to fix the guide in this position.  1.31.2.2.5. The next step is to get the correct amount side shift by lo osening the side shift guide locking screw and then m oving the guide  into contact with the condylar elem ent (Figure 1.20-D). Retighten the locking screw.  After the right horizontal and lateral condylar guidances have been set, adjust the left side of  the articulator with the right lateral excursion record.  Figure 1.20.

Generally, the power of ma gnification fo r laboratory use is in the range of 10x to 30x. Microscopes may be used anytime detailed intricate work is being performed. Their most common uses are for die trimm ing and marking the margins on fixed restorations , achieving adaptation of wax to the m argin areas of fixed restorations, s eating fixed restorations  on the die after cas ting, and quality control assessment of completed restorations. All of these procedures are shown in this chapter. 1.33.  Die  and  Working  Cast  Preparation  Before  Waxing:  (NOTE:  The assu mptions are that the working cast is mounted against its opponent in an articulator and the  removable dies are removed from the cast and ready for trimming.) 1.33.1.  Trimming  the  Die. The com bination of cuts a den tist m akes on a n atural tooth  f or purposes of receiv ing a resto ration is called a  preparation. The   most peripheral extent (outline form) of a preparation is  the margin. A fixed prosthetic restoration,  such as an onlay or a crown, has to cover the entire tooth surf ace a dentist has cut o r prepared. The m argin of the preparatio n also represents the border or  margin of a proposed restoratpreparation the dentist has made, part or the entire margin will be be low gingival tissue. Before a die can be used to make a restoration, any dental stone that covers the margin of a preparation has to be trimmed away. NOTE: Although die trimming is the dentist’s responsibility, a technician is occasionally called on to do it under the dentist’s superv ision. If a technician is to trim dies, m ake wax patterns, and finish castings competently, he or she must have knowledge of basic preparation forms and margin styles (Figure 1.21). ion. Depending on the kind of 1.33.1.1. Margin Styles (Figure 1.22): 1.33.1.1.1. Shoulder. A shoulder margin is one that intersects with the surface of a tooth at a 90-degree angle. The junction of  a restoration with a preparation at a shoulde r is called a butt join t. This kind of  m argin is alm ost ex clusively res erved for all-ceram ic crowns or metal-ceramic restorations with f acial porcelain margins because of porcelain’s limitations as a res torative m aterial. W hen f abricating  an all-ceram ic crown, the 90-degree angle between the m argin and facial su rface must be  rounded or radial to prevent porcelain from  fracturing. A thin, sharp m argin would contribute toward better sealing a restoration to a tooth, but the physical properties of porcelain do not permit it to be used in that way. 1.33.1.1.2. Chamfer. The chamfer is usua lly the margin of choice f or complete and partial metal crowns and pinledges. 1.33.1.1.3.  Knife  Edge. In m ost cases, the kn ife edge (or chisel edge) is considadequate substitute for the chamfer margin.  ered an 46  Figure 1.21. Preparation Forms. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 1.22. Margin Styles.    1.33.1.1.4. Bevel. There are m any areas in the various  preparations for reception of a m etal casting where shoulder-like cuts are made. Examples include the gingival seat of an inlay or onlay and the faciogingival area of a com plete anterio r crown. The place where a AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  47 conventional shoulder would join with the surface of a tooth at 90 degr ees is changed into a  45-degree angle. This alteration, called a  bevel, has the desirable effect of lengthening and sharpening a restoration’s margin. 1.33.1.2. Die Trimming. Define margins and reshape the  area immediately below the m argins before making wax patterns. Use a m icroscope to perform these steps to be able to  clearly see the margin. When refining the wax m argins of a  pattern, rest the instru ment on the die base. Figure 1.23 shows how a deeply ditched die can  influence overcontouri ng of the pattern. The margin definition can be perform ed in two steps:  (1) remove excess stone next to the gingival margin of the preparation, and (2) define the gingival margin by careful carving.  Figure 1.23. Pattern Contour Influenced by Die Trimming.   1.33.1.2.1. Bulk Trimming. Do the initia l bulk trimmings with a pea r-shaped bur (Figure 1.24). Expose about 4 mm of stone below the margin without creating a deep recess. The die contours should resemble the root portion of a natural tooth.  Figure 1.24.

Do not use a lead pencil because lead transferred to the investment mold can create pits in the casting. Then apply a very thin surface hardener over the marked margins.

Sometimes, certain subtle changes or even a major change is indicated to preserve the smile and personality of the patient. 1.35. Morphology of Anterior Teeth. A thorough understanding of tooth  morphology is essential to meet the esthetic dem ands of the patien t. The eye is  extremely sensitiv e to the outline for m of objects,  even more so when teeth are being viewed prom inently silhouetted against the dark  oral cavity. In fact, small differences in color will  go unnoticed if the form  and textur e of the teeth ar e correct. Som e technicians unknowingly create the  same morphological features in ev ery restoration they m ake. This approach lacks the pers onalization needed so the re storation will harmonize with  the patient’s physical characteristics. For a detailed disc ussion of tooth morphology, review Volume 1, Chapter 4. Discussion of morphology in this chapter will be limited to anterior teeth only. rely on personal knowledge and 1.35.1. Diagnostic Aids:  1.35.1.1. The exact size and for m of the original  tooth is usually produced  in the r estoration. However, because the technician is nor mally not directly involved with the patien t and m ust rely only on the information present, this task can be very difficult. Examples of diagnostic aids that should be available include preoperative casts and casts m ade from i mpressions of diagnostic wax-ups or provisional restorations.  1.35.1.2.

These casts can be used as references when simulating the morphology of natural teeth in fixed prosthodontics. ilable. Therefore, it m ay be  desirable to save discarded 1.35.2. Outline Form. The space available for crowns and FPDs will determine the dimensions of the restoration. A general guide, sim ilar to th at used for rem ovable prosthodontics (Volum e 1,  Chapter 7), can be used to determine the sizes of anterior teeth. According to this guide the central incisor is one-sixteenth of the length and width in relation to the  length and width of the patient’s face. Also, the basic form s of teeth (square, sq uare tapering, tapering, and ovoid) should agree with the face form. 1.35.3. Sex. The idea that a person’s sex de termines the surface form of his or her teeth is invalid. Dental morphology seems to depend m ore on t he patient’s face for m and personality than on his  or her sex. The traditional fe minine and m asculine forms are now thought of as displaying youthfulness or advancing age (wear). 1.35.4. Age. The changes that occur with ag ing can be attributed to attr ition, abrasion, and/or soft tissue recession, as follows: 1.35.4.1. Attrition (Abrasion):  ls som e 1.35.4.1.1. Attrition is  m ost noticeable in interesting details about the mandibular arch. The lack of wear due to youth is shown by the  full length of the clinical crown in Figure 1.incisal embrasures. At middle age, the incisal edges of the centrals are worn, but the laterals show only m inimal we ar. In later years, the la teral inc isors begin to wear, resu lting in a  straight line extending from lateral to lateral.  25. Also note the effect attrition has on the the m axillary arch, but it also revea Figure 1.25. Attrition of Maxillary Incisors With Aging.  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 1.35.4.1.2. Attrition with aging has a dram atic effect on the patien t’s smile. In youth, more of incisal edge extends below the lip and results in a vigorous appearance. As the length of the incisal edge shortens, an older appearance results.  1.35.4.1.3. The wear patte rns asso ciated with  attrition are  af fected by the positio n of  the teeth, direction of m andibular m ovement,  and condition of the antagonists. Once these factors have been an alyzed, reproduce the restoration’s proper wear  pattern, assuming the case is well m ounted on a progra mmed articulator. If attriti on advances, the dentin is exposed and a roughened surface results. The ex posed dentin is porous and quickly stains to an orange-b rown color.  Especially apparen t  in the m andibular teeth  (Figure 1.26), this is helpful to simulate aging changes. 50   Figure 1.26. Exposed Dentin Caused by Attrition of Mandibular Incisors.   1.35.4.2.  Soft  Tissue  Recession. T he architecture of a person’s gingiva changes with age (Volume 1, Figure 7.91). The soft tissues supporting the teeth reced e gradually with age as shown in Figure 1.27. As the narrower root portions of the teeth are exposed, the teeth begin to appear triangular. This effect is also partially due to attrition at the incisal edge. 1.35.5. Patient Profile. In considering the effect patient prof ile has, the gingivoincisal profile of teeth may be straight, convex, or slightly c oncave (Figure 1.28). Most  teeth exhibit a “rounding in” of the labial surf ace form in the incisa l third. This reduces the forward light reflection and prevents the incis al edg es from  appearing g rossly protruded. The m esiodistal profile m ay be straight, convex, or concave, depending on the shape of the zygomatic arch. 1.35.6.  Embrasures. All of the four eimportant. The incisal embrasure is particularly important because it has the most effect on outline form. The location of the contact areas separates  the embrasures from each other and helps shape the em brasure form . Generally, teeth with squ are outlines have contact ar eas long er th an tho se with more tapered outlines. W hen more separati on between teeth is desire d, shorten the contact  area to expose more space and tis sue in the interproxim al. The labial surface and em brasure form also has a significant effect on appearance. A convex labial surface with widened embrasure form will sca tter ref lected light ray s a nd appear narro wer th an a f lat la bial su rface with closed embrasure form. mbrasures (incis al, gingival, labial, and lingual) are AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 1.27. Attrition and Soft Tissue Recession of Maxillary Teeth With Aging. 51  Figure 1.28. Effect of Patient Profile on the Surface Form of Teeth.    1.35.7. Long Axis. Line angles, heights of contour, and th e incisal edge determ ine the long axis.  Restorations should appear as if they are actually  growing in place. Th e long axes o f restorations should be in line with the inclina tion of the root eminences. It is helpful to scribe lines on the cast to indicate this inclination. With anteriors, the root generally inclines distal ly and, as a result, th e apical cres t is of ten f ormed in the dista l thir d of the cervical portion.  A restoration im properly contoured in the cervue look unnatural, but m ay also cause tissical area will not only 52  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 inflammation. The long axis is generally at right angles to the incisal edge. When teeth lap over or under each other, their long axes change and the incisal edges must be made to reflect that change. When all of these factors have been met, harmony will be present. 1.35.8.  Midline. The d ental m idline is bes t determ ined by the patient’s facial m idline. M any believe the m idline of t he restoration should m atch the opp osing arch. The exact p osition of th e midline relative to the opposing arch is not as important as the size and arrangement of teeth. At a glance, you remember the arrangement and size of teeth before noticing anything else. 1.35.9. Incisal One-Third. The incisal one-third of  mandibular anteriors is  often in the “esth etic zone.” The incisal edge is gradually lost with  aging. Attrition occurs on the lingual surface of the  maxillary incisors  and  the labia l surface of th e m andibular inciso rs. As attrition proceeds, concavities on the lingual fossa be come more apparent. Give careful co nsideration to these areas when carving the lingual fossae and lingual embrasures. 1.35.10. Surface Characterization. If the surface characterization of restorations is not accurately simulated, reflection  from  the surface and luster  will d iffer from  those of the adjacen t teeth, making the restoration appear artificial. 1.35.10.1. Ridges and Grooves. Anterior teeth usually have three labial ridges and two shallow labial grooves between them. In the cerv ical third, one to four horizont al grooves exist with horizontal ridges between them . There m ay also  be m any other irregularities, such as fine developmental lines, particularly in younger den tition (Figure 1.29). The older the person, the less characterization is present and the sm oother the tooth s urfaces are. If correspon ding teeth on the opposite sid e are presen t, sim ply reproduce those surface characterizations in the restoration. However, if the  contralateral forms are not available, the re maining dentition will show surface characteristics typical of that patient. 1.35.10.2.  Surface  Textures. The surface texture of a restoration sh ould be slig htly m ore emphasized than th e adjacent teeth being m atched. A tex tured surface will d iffuse and sca tter light in an irregular m anner. Surface texturing m ay help to conceal slight differences in colo r and make the restoration appear more natural. 1.36. Improving Esthetics: 1.36.1. Changes in Tooth Width: 1.36.1.1.  Narrow  Spaces. A narrow  space can be treated b y overlapping at th e incisal edge (Figure 1.30 -A). Another way to treat the same problem  is to flatten the facial su rface an d move the contact facioincisally (Figure 1.30-B). 1.36.1.2. Wide Spaces. When the space to be filled is wid er than normal, the problem is more difficult. Figure 1.31-A shows how to treat this  wide space by rounding  the labial surface and moving the contact gingivally. Th is moves the visible labial lin e angles  to the center of the tooth, g iving the illusio n that  the tooth is narrower than the space it occupies. Still another method would be to recontour the  restoration in a lingual direc tion and move the contact area s lingually (F igure 1.31-B). (Movem ent of the contact areas labiwhich is to m ake the tooth appear wider.) Vert ical lines on  the labial  surface will also m ake teeth appear narrower. ally has the opposite effect,  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 1.29.

Changes in Tooth Length: AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 1.36.2.1. Long Crown Length. Teeth that have become periodontally involved have extra long clinical crowns which can be made to appear shorter by creating a definite cervical line (Figure 1.32). Placem ent of the cervical  lin e is determ ined by the ad jacent natural teeth  and overall appearance of crown length. The crown can be made to appear even shorter by adding gingival stain to the root portion. An alternative approach would be to reduce the cervical collar and add gingival shade porcelain to restore the contour . Gingival shade porcelain m ay be supplied by the manufacturer or made by combining various amounts of modifiers to dentin porcelain.  Figure 1.32. Cervical Collar and Shading To Reduce Length.  1.36.2.2. Short Crown Lengths. Short teeth can be m ade to  seem longer by adding vertical lines or a v ertical concavity to the surface tex ture. These pro cedures will give th e illusion of length, but only to a limited degree. A greater increase in length can only be made by surgically repositioning the gingival margin.  m w ould appear tapered, and those in the ovoid 1.36.3. Changes in Tooth Position. The effect of tooth position and alignm ent of a  tooth within the arch may be more important than the actual form of the tooth its elf. This can be demonstrated by using three sets of teeth of the sam e mold and shade. If each  set were arrang ed into three different arch form s (square, tapering, and ovoid), the tee th in the squ arely aligned  arch would appear square, those in the tapering forarrangement would appear ovoid. 1.36.4. Tooth Rotation. Rotating a tooth about its axis to cr eate an overlay allo ws the placement of a wider tooth m esiodistally in to a sm aller sp ace. Subtle axial  rotation (Figure 1. 33) gives a natural appearance to th e arrangement of teeth, but taking it to  the extreme will have an opposite effect and m ay not be pleasing es thetically. A tooth m ay lose som e of its  identity, depending on the degree of rotation. F igure 1.34 shows how dram atic this change m ight be  if the distals of the six anterior teeth are rotated in and the m esials out. Notice how  much narrower the teeth appear even though they occupy the same relative positions.  Section 1I—Waxing Individual Cast Restorations and FPD Retainers 1.37. Overview.

Determining  the  Occlusion  Scheme  for  the  Fixed  Prosthesis  and  Setting  the  Incisal  Guide Table:  1.38.1. The first step in selecting an occlusion sc heme for a fixed prosthesis is to analyze what kind of occlusion the patient has. Once this  has been d ecided, the dentist has the option of imitating it or changing it when ordering the rest oration. The technician  must have enough basic  knowledge to understand and follow the dentist’s directions. 1.38.2. There are com plex cases where there is no  definite way of telling what kind of occlusion the patient originally had. In these  cases, the dentist is forced to cho ose a s cheme of occlus ion based on educated guess ratherom directly observable tooth relationships. The standards for recognizing natural tooth occlusions are in Volume 1, Chapter 5.  1.38.3. In fixed prosthetic dentistr y, an incisal guide table is used to protect the dental stone teeth against abrasion, to pro gram the  movement of an articulator so  a restoration can be m ade that conforms to the movement, or for both reasons. D ecide on MI and eccentric occlusion patterns as  follows:  than drawing conclusions fr1.38.3.1. Maximum Intercuspation (MI). If a patient has a cusp-to-embrasure type of MI and there is an opportunity to switch the prosthesis over to the cusp-to-fossa variety, do so. 1.38.3.2. Eccentric Occlusion (Example #1). In this example, a posterior fixed prosthesis has to be made and the guiding surfaces of anterior teeth in eccentric movements are intact. 1.38.3.2.1.  Select  an  Occlusion. Barring unu sual circumstances , the  rule is to m ake a posterior fixed prosthesis blend into the existing occlusion. For example, after the prosthesis AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 is finished, a cast that  showed anterior guidance should  show posterior tooth relationships characteristic of anterior guidance.  1.38.3.2.2. Set the Incisal Guide Table (Figure 1.35). When casts move by one another in lateral and protrus ive excursions, the surfaces  of stone teeth wear away rapid ly. When the objective is sim ply to preser ve whatever tooth guidance th ere is between opposing arches, adjust the incisal guide table to minimize the wear on stone surfaces. Place the maxillary and mandibular casts in protrusion and tilt the inc isal guide table until it is a hair’ s breadth short of contact with the p in. Place th e casts in righ t and left late ral excursion relation ships and adjust the wings of the incisal guide table in the same way. 56   Figure 1.35. Setting the Incisal Guide Table.   1.38.3.3. Eccentric Occlusion (Example #2). In this example, an anterior fixed prosthesis has to be m ade and the k ey eccentric movem ent guiding surfaces of anterior teeth are in volved in the restoration (lingual surface of a maxillary canine, facial surface of a mandibular canine). 1.38.3.3.1.  Select  an  Occlusion. The dentist will d ecide whet her the  case  is  going to b e rebuilt in anterior guidance or in group function. 1.38.3.3.2.  Set  the  Incisal  Guide  Table. The objective is to m ake the articulator m ove laterally as if the guiding surfaces of anterior te eth had already been restored to th e type of occlusion the dentist wants. First, slant the incisal guide table to match the patient’s actual or programmed rise from MI to anterior tooth cont act in protrusion. Next , set the lateral wings to make the case behave like the type of occlusion chosen for the affected side or sides. 1.38.3.3.3. Build the Anterior Fixed Prosthesis. Do this to correspond to the m ovements programmed into the articulator. 1.38.3.4.  Eccentric  Occlusion  (Example  #3). In this example, a m ixture of anterior and  posterior fixed units hav e to be m ade in th e same arch, and key eccen tric movement guiding AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  57 surfaces of anterior teeth must be restored. Directions for selecting an occlusion and setting the incisal guide table are essentially th e same as those given in Exam ple #2 (paragraph 1.38.3.3). The anterior restorations are waxed f irst, and then the posterior units are waxed to confor m to the type of occlusion chosen. 1.38.4. Custom Incisal Guide Tables: 1.38.4.1. An adjustable incisal guide table looks like a precision adjustment mechanism; but, in reality, it is  rather crud e. There is a rela tively common type of lateral m ovement where a combination of group function and  anterior guidance occurs. As a  lateral movement out of MI begins, the posterior teeth on the  working side are in group func tion. As the late ral movement progresses, the anterior teeth on the working side m ake suf ficient contac t to s eparate the  posteriors (Volume 1, Chapter 5).  1.38.4.2. In other kinds of cases, the teeth of  patients with m arked Class II  jaw relationsh ips may follow irregular protrusive paths. An adjuproduce these kinds of articulator move ments. To deal with the problem, som e dentists use a custom  incisal  guide  table  made  from self-curing plastic. Thos e who use this type of table usually make it before sending the case to the laboratory.  1.38.4.3. To make a custom incisal guide table: stable incisal guide table cannot be set to 1.38.4.3.1.

AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 1.40. Materials. Materials for applying wax to dies and shap ing patterns include die lubricant and types  A and C inlay wax (the best available). 1.41. Steps in Waxing a Pattern: 1.41.1. Wax expands when heated and contracts when cooled (about 0.02 percent for each degree Fahrenheit of temperature change). Assume that a pattern, waxed under a light bulb near a Bunsen flame, is invested in ano ther part of the  room where the tem perature might be 10 to 15  oF cooler. Expect the pattern to shrink. During the subsequent casting procedure, gold contracts about 1.25 to 1.5 percent from  the molten to th e solid state. Expansion of the  investment mold is supposed to compensate for the predictab le con tractions of  solidifying gold and not for unanticipated wax pattern shrinkage.  1.41.2. To obtain a satisfactory f it of a casting to a die, you have  to be aware of environm ental factors that might affect the stability of inlay wax. Try to wax and invest wax patterns in an area of the room  where th e temperature is relativ ely  constant. Use room  t emperature water for the investment mix and invest the pattern as quickly as possible after completion. 1.41.3. Lubricate th e die, proximal surfaces of  adjacent teeth, and occl usal surfaces of opposing teeth. 1.41.4. Cover the die with a prim ary layer of wax  (wax blank) as a foundation for the rest of the pattern. One method that is adaptable to any type  of preparation is to apply m olten wax with a #7 wax spatula, com pletely covering the preparation’ s surfaces before any part of the wax cools. Once you have laid down a full layer of coverage,  you can proceed to build the rest of the pattern at a more leisurely rate.  1.41.5. Another m ethod that is particularly usef ul when waxing com plete crowns is to dip the lubricated die into a pool  of molten wax. An electric wax heater  is perfect for the job. Use second dip for heavier initial coverage. On e of the major objectives in this s tep is to b egin forming an accurately fitting pattern with smooth internal walls. Avoid grossly ove rextending the wax blank. Carefully remove excess wax from all margins. 1.41.6. Flow on additional wax with a spatula and contour the pattern. The techniques for occlusal and axial contouring of wax patterns are: 1.41.6.1. Negative waxing, which is the  buildup, smash, and carve technique (Figure 1.36), as follows:  urface of th e pattern uniform ly on the die. Bring the 1.41.6.1.1. After laying the foundation layer of  wax, overbuild the pattern intentionally with more wax. Soften the occluding sworking and opposing casts together (sm ash) so the teeth opposite the pattern can roughl y mold an MI contact in the wax.  1.41.6.1.2. Carve the wax back to proper anat omical and functional contours. When carving wax, hold the instrum ent in either a palm  or pe n type of grasp. Use the palm  grip to m ake forceful strokes that rem ove large amounts of wax without rega rd for the fine details. You have better control when using  a finger rest. Brace a finger on the han d that is holding the carving instrument on the die surface or patter n while carving is in progress. To negative wax a pattern, use applicable portions of paragraph 1.42. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 1.36. Negative Waxing of a Pattern. 59   1.41.6.2. Positive waxing, which consists of adding wax to a wax blank (foundation layer, co re layer) in small increments and in highly selected areas to form a three-d imensional skeleton of a crown’s final contours. Once the wax f ramework is complete, all that remains is to fill in the spaces between the various parts  of the lattice. The obvious diffe rence between th is technique and negative waxing is that wax is being built up to produce a given shape instead of being carved back. To positive wax a pattern, use applicable portions of paragraph 1.42 to shape axial surfaces. Then use the wax-added technique presen ted in Section 1J fo r the occlus al surface. NOTE: In producing an anatomically and functionally shaped pattern, the choice of negative or positive waxing techniques is up to the den tist. If no specific  instructions accompany the case, it is up to the technician.  and the stone die back to where the 1.41.7.  When carving the junction  between the wax preparation begins, use blunt carv ers instead of  sharp instrum ents. Blunt carvers will produce a clean, well-defined m argin without marring the die’s surface.  NOTE: If the wax pattern m argins are grossly distorted, re move the pa ttern and ca refully cut it back 2 mm off the m argin. Apply a fresh coat of die lubricate to the die and reseat the pattern. Quickly flow molten wax into the space created to cover the margin and provide a smooth internal adaptation. 1.41.8. Smooth and polish the pattern. Use the bristle brush to get at occlusal surface irregularities. Use a piece of silk or nylon cloth wrapped around the end of a finger to smooth axial surfaces. 1.41.9. Recheck MI co ntact and eccentric m ovement relationship s. Test occlusal contacts b y dusting pow dered wax on the pattern, bringing the working and opposing  casts together, and observing where the pattern wax shows through the dust film.  NOTE: Do not use talcum powder  in place of zinc stearate for occlusal verificatio n. Talcum powder contains im purities that cou ld cause porosity in the casting.  1.42. Anatomic Versus Functional Contouring of Wax Patterns: 1.42.1. When a pattern is anatomically contoured, the pattern either looks like a natural tooth or it blends well into a natu ral tooth ’s surface. Al so, its ov erall shap e an d size are proportionally  correct in com parison to the teeth around it. Anatpleasing to the eye.

In some instances, anatomical and functional shaping of patterns amount to the same thing. As an example, when a pattern’s  anatomic proportions look “right ” in com parison to the natural tooth surfaces around it, chances ar e the resulting casting will help preserve the health of gingival  tissues. However, just because the occlusal portion of a pattern looks like the chewing surface of a  tooth does not mean it will function without conflict in the patient’s mouth. val tissues.

From the bulge, the contour of the facial surface should be flat or sloping inw ard as it enters the crevice and reaches the crown margin (subgingival). 1.43.2. Lingual Surface. The lingual height of contour on most teeth can be seen in the  gingival third. Like the facial surface, the height of conto ur should not project more than 0.5 mm from the cervix. Exceptions to this rule  involve the m andibular premolars and molars. Their lingual height of contour is in the  middle third. The bulge on m andibular premolars and molars may protrude as much as 0.75 to 1 mm, respectively. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 1.38.

Proximal  Contact  Relationships  Among  Anterior  Teeth. Contacts between adjacent anterior teeth (Figure 1.39) usually occu r within th e incis al th ird, m esially. On the distal surfaces of anterior teeth, the contacts are located closer to the junction of the incisal and middle thir ds. Always  try  to  prov ide a  con tact  with ad jacent tee th to keep the  teeth  f rom moving out of position. However, there are certain lim itations to the m esial-distal width of  restorations. Avoid  making restorations  so  wide  that the patien t has dif ficulty k eeping the restorations clean. If a patient has a natural occurring diastema, it should be provided for in the pattern. Check with the dentist regarding exceptions to the rule of providing proximal contacts. 1.45.2.3. Gingival Embrasures. Accommodate the patient’s interdental papillae in the gingival embrasures. To keep the papillae healthy, do  not overcontour the proxim al surface of pattern s or place the contact areas too f ar gingivally. Esthetics of the restoration will g reatly influence the final embrasure form.  62  Figure 1.39. Proximal Contact Relationships Among Anterior Teeth. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005   1.45.2.4.

Proximal  Contact  Relationships  Among  Posterior  Teeth. Contact areas are generally eg g-shaped, w ith the long  axis  of   the “egg” being oriented buccolingually (Figure 1.40). Occlusogingivally, the contac t area is located at the ju nction of the occlusal and m iddle thirds of a proximal surface. Buccolingually, the contact area can be found at the junction of the buccal and middle thirds of a posterior tooth ’s proximal surface except b etween the maxillary molars, where it is located near the occlusal mesial or distal developmental groove area (Figure 1.41).  Figure 1.40. Posterior Contact Area and Embrasure Characteristics.  Figure 1.41. Maxillary and Mandibular Contact Areas (Occlusal View).    1.46.2.3. Marginal Ridges. The marginal ridges on both sides of an occlusal embrasure should be oriented at about the sam e height. Also, marginal ridges are  supposed to be rounded so the resulting occlusal em brasure looks like a V-sh aped crevice. Avoid square, sharply angled marginal ridges on adjacent teeth  in con tact  because they produce crack-like occlusal embrasures and improperly placed contact areas. 1.46.2.4. Gingival Embrasures. For interproximal papillae to stay he althy, the natural shap e and dim ensions of gingival em brasures m ust  still b e pr esent af ter a  f ixed r estoration is cemented in the patient’s m outh. The apex of a  gingival embrasure is th e result of two convex proximal surfaces com ing together at th e con tact area. However, the lower part of the embrasure is for med by diverging,  concave proximal surfaces. Reductio n of em brasure space with subseq uent com pression of th e gingiva  happens when the proximogingival surfaces of patterns are overcontoured and when contact areas are located too far gingivally. 1.46.2.5.  Buccal  and  Lingual  Embrasures. A contact area is located  at the junction of the  buccal and m iddle thirds of a  posterior tooth’s proxim al surf ace. As  a result, the lingu al 64  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 occlusal table for the next chewing stroke ize, embrasure is larger than the buccal em brasure.  Because o f this relative difference in schewing movements will divert m ost of the food  toward the tongue ins tead of into the buccal vestibule. The tongue moves food back onto the more efficiently than the cheek muscle does. Besides the chewing efficiency advantage, proper stimulation of  interp roximal tissue s requ ires th at the lingu al em brasure be larg er than  the buccal. 1.46.2.6. Maximum Intercuspation (MI). Decide whether the stam p cusp contact in MI  will follow the cusp-fossa or cusp-em brasure type of  impact. Cusp-fossa imp acts are preferred. Be sure to introduce enough horizontal  overlap so the patient does  not have a problem  with cheek biting. Review Volume 1, Chapter 5. 1.46.2.7. Working Occlusion.

The wax-added technique is a method of occlusal surface formation through addition of small incre ments of  wax to  a wax  blank.  ( NOTE: Review Volum e 1, Chapter 4.) Instead of carvin g grooves to produce ridges, the ridgesridges are being for med, grooves develop between the ridges by contrast. Som e carving may be done in association w ith the wax-added technique, but only to em phasize and sm ooth the de pths of the grooves. This m ethod is popularly regarded as the ideal way to organize a m utually protected occlusion, but there is no reason why the technique cannot be used with sim ilar success to  organize other kind s of occlusio n schem es (group function, delayed anterior guidance). Axial surface and occlusal anatomy are developed by following the standardized waxing sequence in paragraph 1.48. 1.48. Standardized Waxing Sequence:  are built up in wax. As the 1.48.1. The first step in the wax-added technique is to properly shape a wax blank on the die. Wax is applied to  the en tire die in an eve n layer to keep distortion to a m inimum. Build up the ax ial surfaces of the blank into their prop er facial, li ngual, and proxim al contours. Leave the occlus al surface out of contact with opposing teeth to allow space for development of the occlusal anatomy. 1.48.2. Place m axillary and m andibular stamp cusp wax cones and check them  for clearance in  lateral excursions. 1.48.3. Place maxillary and mandibular shearing cusp wax cones and check them  for clearance in lateral excursions. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  65 1.48.4.

Refine the occlusal surface to emphasize the desirable patterns of MI contact. 1.49. Specific Steps in the Waxing Sequence: 1.49.1. Placing Maxillary and Mandibular Stamp Cusp Cones. Place the stamp cusp cones first because they are difficult to see after the shearing cusps and ridges are added (Figure 1.42-A and -B). The stamp cusp cones (linguathe lower) represent the final position and length of the stam p cusps. When complete, the stamp cusp and associated ridges will account for 60 percent of the total occlusal area. l of the upper and buccal of  Figure 1.42. Placement of Maxillary and Mandibular Stamp Cusp Cones.  1.49.1.1. Position. Center the s tamp cusp cones, repr esenting the vertical dim ension holding cusps, over the opposing toot h’s central sulcus area.  This helps orient th e forces of occlusion more or less parallel to a tooth’s long axis.  If a pattern is being waxed against opposing natural teeth, try to  m ake the stam p cu sp cone hit in a fossa rather than on the tops of proxim al marginal ridges. When waxing one pattern agains t another, place the stamp cusp cones for one pattern over the an ticipated fossa sites on the  other. In MI, the id eal is for the tip o f a stam p cusp to be supported at three points around an opposing fossa’s rim. Such three-point support is known as tripodism (Figure 1.43). Avoid a mortar-and-pestle arrangement in which the cusp tip actually contacts the bottom of the fossa if possible. 1.49.1.2. Length. When waxing against natural teeth, make the stamp cusp cones long enough to hit the opposing tooth in MI. W hen waxing opposing patterns against one another, make the stamp cusp cones long enough to m aintain the ante roposterior curve (Curve  of Spee) dictated by the stamp cusps of the unprepared teeth (Fi gure 1.42-C). Once the length of the cones has been established, build up the sides of the fossae on the opposing patterns to meet them. 1.49.1.3. Balancing Excursion Stamp Cusp Relations (Figure 1.42-D): 1.49.1.3.1. Premolars. In a balancing excursion, the stamp cusps of the mandibular first and second premolars pass mesially to the maxillary premolar stamp cusps.   66  Figure 1.43. Cusp-Fossa MI Contacts. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  1.49.1.3.2.  First  Molars. The m esiolingual stam p cusp of the upper first m olar passes between the distobu ccal and the d istal stam p cu sps of  the  lower f irst m olar, div iding th e space as equally as possible. 1.49.1.3.3.  Second  Molars. The stam p cusps of the lower second molar relate to the maxillary second m olar’s stamp cusps in the  same way as the opposin g first m olars. The  only difference is that the lower second molar pattern might or might not carry a distal cusp. 1.49.2. Placing Maxillary and Mandibular Shearing Cusp Cones (Buccal of the Upper and Lingual of the Lower) (Figure 1.44-A Through –D): 1.49.2.1. Length. Make shearing cusps shorter than stamp cusps to form a proper mediolateral curve (Curve of W ilson) (Figure 1.44-C). Ante roposteriorly, make shearing cusps confor m to the desired Curve of Spee.   AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 1.44.

Make the shearing cusp cones of the upper premolars pass distally to m andibular stam p  cusps with  am ple clearance. In  a working excursion, m ake the shearing cu sps of the m axillary prem olars travel through  opposing  embrasures. 1.49.2.2.2. First Molar. The mesiobuccal cusp cone of the upper first molar passes between the m esiobuccal and distobuccal cu sp cones of   the lower f irst m olar, dividing  the space evenly. 1.49.2.2.3. Second Molar. The shearing cusps of the upper  second molar are related to the lower second m olar in essentially the sam e way an upper second molar relates to its opponent. 1.49.2.3.  Mandibular  Shearing  Cusp  Working  Excursion  Relations  (Figure  1.44-B  and  -D): 1.49.2.3.1. First and Second Premolars. The lingual cusp cones of the upper first prem olar passes distal to the lin gual cusp cone of the lower first premol ar. The lin gual cusp cone of the upper second premolar either passes over or travels behind  the lingual cusp cones of the lower second premolar. 1.49.2.3.2. First Molar. The m esiolingual stamp cusp cone  of the upper first m olar travels between the two lingual cusp cones of the lower first molar, dividing the distance equally. 1.49.2.3.3. Second Molar. The lower second molar shearing cusp cones are placed in thesame relation to the upper second molar as the lower first molar is to the upper first molar.  1.49.3. Waxing the Peripheral Marginal Ridges (Figure 1.45-A Through -D and Figure 1.46). The peripheral marginal ridges consist of buccal , lingual, and proximal segments. The buccal and lingual marginal ridges are com posed of the m esial and distal cusp ridges of a tooth’s buccal and lingual cusps, respectively. Each posterior tooth has mesial and distal proximal marginal ridges. A proximal marginal ridge is sepa rated into buccal and lingual parts by a groove or “sluiceway.” ewing and allow for stim ulation of lingual Sluiceways are escape routes for food during chinterproximal gingival tissue. Control of buccal a nd lingual peripheral marginal ridge height is an important influence on the schem e of occlusi on you want to develop. If buccal and lingual peripheral marginal ridges are waxed so no contact occurs with opposing cusp ridges or inclines in lateral excursions, the case is anterio r guided. If mandibular buccal peripheral marginal ridges are waxed into  working side contac t with the lin gual inc lines of  m axillary bucca l cusps, grou p function results, as follows: 68  Figure 1.45. Placement of Marginal Ridge Segments. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 1.46. Marginal Ridge Contours (Buccal View).    1.49.3.1. Proximal Surface Peripheral Marginal Ridges and Opposing Cusps (MI):  d” support within the fossae. A proxim1.49.3.1.1. Cusps to Fossa Stamp Cusp Orientations. In this type of  MI, all s tamp cusps occupy fossae and the cusp tips have “tripoal marginal ridge for ms one wall of a proxim al fossa (mesial or distal fossa). W hen a stamp cusp hits in a proximal fossa, one of the tripod contacts occurs on a proximal marginal ridge (Figure 1.43). The other two tripod contacts occur on stam p and shearing cusp triangular ridges yet to be laid down. NOTE: When a stamp cusp hits in a central fossa, all three tripod contacts are found on various triangular ridge inclines. 1.49.3.1.2. Cusp to Embrasure Stamp Orientations. In the cusp-embrasure concept of MI, most of the m andibular buccal cusps hit across two opposing proxim al marginal ridges that form an embrasure. Almost all of the maxillary lingual cusps are in a fossa relationship with mandibular teeth. (See Volume 1, Chapter 5 and Figure 5.4, for details.) Be sure there are no interferences between proxim al surface periph eral m arginal ridg es and opposing cusps during lateral movements. 1.49.3.2.  Maxillary  and  Mandibular  Lingual  Peripheral  Marginal  Ridges  (Working Excursion  Relationship). The convention is to wax opposing lingual peripheral m arginal ridges and cusp inclines out of contact when the teeth are in a working relationship. This is true for group function and mutually protected occlusions. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  69 1.49.3.3.  Maxillary  and  Mandibular  Buccal  Peripheral  Marginal  Ridges  (Working Excursion Relationship): 1.49.3.3.1.  Mutually  Protected  Occlusion. Mandibular buccal peripheral m arginal ridges pass by all parts of the maxillary buccal cusps with clearance. 1.49.3.3.2. Group Function. Buccal peripheral m arginal ridges of mandibular teeth contact the lingual inclines of buccal cusps and the  buccal peripheral m arginal ridges of maxillary  teeth. 1.49.3.4.  Maxillary  Lingual  and  Mandibular  Buccal  Peripheral  Marginal  Ridges (Balancing Excursion Relationship). There will be no contact  of any kind between opposing posterior teeth during the progress of a balancing excursion. 1.49.4. Positioning Maxillary and Mandibular Stamp Cusp Triangular Ridges (Figure 1.47-A and -B):  Figure 1.47. Placement of Stamp Cusp and Shearing Cusp Triangular Ridges.  1.49.4.1. MI Contacts. The MI fossa contacts that should develop as a result of this step appear in Figure 1.43. The contacts form  where the stamp cusp triangular ridges in one arch touch the opposing stamp cusp triangular ridges. 1.49.4.2. Balancing Excursion Relationships. There should be no balancing excursion contact between any surface of opposing stam p cusps ( Figure 1.47-C). Stam p c usp triangular ridg es must be waxed in specific directions to allo w escape of the opposing stam p cusps out of the central sulcus area with  no interferences during  a balancing move ment. To achieve this goal, maxillary stamp cusp triangular ridg es are angled  toward the distal of the tooth as they trav el from a cusp tip to the central sulcus. Mandibular  stamp cusp triangular ridges angle toward the mesial of mandibular teeth as th ey travel from cusp tip to ce ntral sulcus. Also, on teeth having multiple stamp cusps, the junction  of triangular  ridge inclines  form s a com paratively d eep valley of groove to allow escape of an opposing stamp cusp.   70  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 1.49.5. Positioning Shearing Cusp Triangular Ridges (Figure 1.47-D and -E): 1.49.5.1. MI Contacts. The MI fossa contacts that should develop as a result of this step appear in Figure 1.43. The contacts occur because stamp cusp marginal ridges (lingual marginal ridges of the m axillary poster iors and f acial m arginal ridge s of  the m andibular po steriors) tou ch opposing shearing cusp triangular ridges. 1.49.5.2. Working Excursion Relationships. In a working excursion, the mandibular shearing cusps are su pposed to miss the m axillary stamp cusps (F igure 1.47-F). In the case o f a group  function oc clusion, the  m axillary shear ing cu sp triang ular ridge s would sh ow working excursion contact with  m andibular buccal cus p  mesial and distal cusp ridges. W hen the occlusion is anterior guided, maxillary shearing cusps would miss the mandibular stamp cusps during a working m ovement. To ac hieve the  recommended working and balancing relations, the following information becomes important: 1.49.5.2.1. Recall how the stam p cusp triangula r ridges were angled when they were laid down. Shearing cusp triangular ri dges travel at roughly a 90-deg ree angle from the cusp tip to the central sulcus area.  1.49.5.2.2. The intersection of a stamp cusp triangular ridge and a shearing cusp triangular ridge produces a characteristic Gothic arch or  arrow point angle. The apex of this angle is  directed toward the distal in the maxillary arch and toward the mesial in the mandibular arch (Figure 1.48).   Figure 1.48. Stamp Cusp Working and Balancing Paths Out of a Fossa MI.  1.49.5.2.3. If stam p cus ps are to move laterally out of their respective fossae without interference, triangular ridges m ust be waxe d in arrow point patterns that parallel the working and balancing paths taken by the stamp cusps. 1.49.6. Verifying MI Contacts. At this time, all contacts are required for proper tripodism of the stamp cusps and should be present. Figure 1.43-C shows the three-point contact of stam p cusps  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  71 within fossae (solid lines). It also shows where the three points of contact occur around the rims of individual stamp cusps (dotted lines). A contact is shared where two triangles overlap. 1.49.7.  Waxing  Supplemental  Anatomy  (Figure  1.49). Supplem ental anatom y is used for the following two purposes: 1.49.7.1. To fill any occlusal surface voids that still remain. 1.49.7.2. To provide any additional contacts that m ight be needed to  achieve stamp cusp tripodism. The most common situation for this  is when a pattern is waxed against an opposing natural tooth. This is b ecause you have no con trol over the natu ral tooth’s shap e and the wax  pattern has to be adapted to existing, unalterable conditions.  Figure 1.49. Placement of Secondary Anatomy and a Cross-Section View of Cusp Placement.  Section 1K—Casting Production 1.50.  Overview. This section describes casting, spruing, crown and FPD gold alloys. CastiChapter 2 of this volume. 1.51. Rules of Casting. Every casting contains porosity, due to so lidification shrinkage. The tas k is to control the location of that porosity, keeping it out of the casting and in the sprue or reservoir system. To do this, apply the following rules: and finishing procedures for conventional ng procedu res for m etal-ceramic  substructures ar e described in  1.51.1. Attach the pattern sprue to the thickest cross-sectional area of the wax pattern. The flow of molten alloy from the reservoir to the pattern should be from regions of greater volume to areas of lesser volume. 1.51.2. Position the pattern margins to the right and mark their location with an orientation dot. In centrifugal casting, the wax patterns should be positioned so their margins face to the right to tak e advantage of the centrifugal, rotational, and gravitational forces on the molten metal. 1.51.3. Position the wax patterns so they will be located in a cold zone of the investment mold and the reservoir in the heat center (thermal zone) of the ring. That way, the castings will cool first, the sprues will cool next, a nd, f inally, the rese rvoirs will cool,  thereby pla cing the por osity in the  reservoir that cools last. 1.51.4. Provide a reservoir with enough m olten alloy  to fill the shrinkage th at occurs within the casting. 1.51.5. Do not cast a button if you  are using a runner bar  or other method of indirect spruing. The exposed surface of a  button causes the button to  cool before the castin g, drawing molten m etal away from the reservoir and reducing the feed of molten alloy to the castings. 72  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  1.51.6. Eliminate sharp turns, res trictions, points, or im pingements on flat  surfaces that increas e turbulence in the sprue. The pathways for the flow  of metal must be smooth, gradual, and without  impediments. Any restrictions can accelerate the m etal’s rate of flow and  lead to abrasion of the mold (mold wash). 1.51.7. Select a cas ting ring of sufficient d iameter and leng th to accommodate the patterns to b e invested. The investm ent layer  surrounding the patterns should be  a uniform thickness to ensure proper mold expansion and thick enough to prevent investment breakage. 1.51.8. Apply a wetting agent to the wax pattern s to reduce the surface tension of investm ent. By cleaning the wax surfaces of conta minants and  covering the wax patte rns with a wetting ag ent, bubbles on the casting will be less likely to occur. 1.51.9. Measure all investm ent liquids and weigh all casting investm ent powder for a precise  liquid-powder ra tio. Sm all va riations in the liq uid-powder ratio greatly a ffect expansion of the  investment. 1.51.10. Elim inate the air in the investm ent  by vacuum m ixing and careful pouring of theinvestment into the casting ring. 1.51.11. Allow the investment to set completely before beginning the burnout procedure. If setting is not complete when the ring is pla ced in the oven, the mold will be weak and m ay break during burnout. 1.51.12. Use a burnout technique that  is specific for the type of patte rns used (wax versus plastic) and suitable for the particular alloy selected. Plastic sprues need to be heated slowly so they soften and do not exert pressure and possib ly break the mold. The burnout tem perature for each casting alloy varies and must be adjusted to ensure adequate expansion and a complete cast. 1.51.13. Use an adequ ate heat so urce to pro perly m elt and cast th e alloy selected for use. Inadequately heated alloy does not atta in maximum fluidity and may not fill the mold completely. Normally, you will notice blunt margins when the al loy is cast too cool. Too much heat can burn off minor alloying elements through volatilization, oxidation, or both. Symptoms may be brittle or porous castings. 1.51.14. Use the  reducing  zone  (middle portion) of the flame to m elt the a lloy and  not the  oxidizing  zone  (outer p ortion) whe n tor ch c asting. The  o xidizing po rtion of  the  f lame can introduce oxygen and carbon into the alloy and adversely affect its properties. 1.51.15. Follow the m anufacturer’s recomm endation on casting procedure and casting force.Whether you use a centrifugal, vacuum, or pressure casting, t oo much force can be just as detrimental as insufficient force. 1.51.16. Direct alloy flow to your margins. In a  centrifugal casting m achine, the m etal will flow downward and to the right first. Position the casting ring to take advantage of this behavior. 1.51.17. Do not quench the ring  immediately after casting. Quenching the casting ri ng before the metal and investm ent have com pletely cooled can  resu lt in tensile f orces being applied to the casting by the investment. W ith prem ature quenching, the m etal is still too hot to possess sufficient strength to resist these forces so the casting can tear. NOTE: Many alloy manufacturers do not recommend quenching the casting ring at all. Instead, they recommend allowing the ring to completely bench cool. 1.51.18.

Use reservoirs that are larger than, or at least equal to, the thickest cross-sectional areas of the pattern. Weigh the wax patterns and sprues to calculate amount of metal required. (Technique based on specific gravity of wax versus casting alloy.) Eliminate sharp turns, restrictions, points, or impingements on flat surfaces. Space patterns 6 mm apart with at least  9 mm of investment between patterns and ring liner. Cover patterns with at least 6 mm of investment. Brush or spray patterns with wetting agent and let dry. Excess amounts cause rough castings. Weigh all casting investment powder and measure investment liquids. Use the proper ratio of each. Vacuum mix and carefully pour investment into rings to ensure a dense, bubble-free mold. Allow investment to set completely prior to burnout.

The purposes of  a sprue channel are to  allow an escape for wax during procedure a nd to direc t the m olten m etal f rom the c rucible into  the  m old cavity . The chann el a lso provides a reservoir of molten metal on which the casting may draw during solidification. Sprue formers are made of wax, plastic, or m etal; and they attach  the wax pattern to the sprue base. W hen the sprue former is burned out, it becomes the sprue through which molten metal will be cast. the early stages of the burnout 1.52.1. Size of the Sprue Former: 1.52.1.1. The sprue form er should be s mooth, short, and thick (6 to 9 mm long and 8 to 10 gauge in diam eter). The size of  th e sprue f ormer will increas e with the size of  the patter n. Molten metal will first cool and  solidify near the walls of th e mold and sprue, form ing a crust around a molten center.  1.52.1.2. The metal will shrink towards this crus t as the m olten center cools, leaving a void in the last part of the m etal to so lidify. This void is called “sh rink spot po rosity.” When using a long, thin sprue former, molten metal will freeze in the sprue channe l before it solidifies in the crown portion of the mold. As a result, the casti ng part of the m old cannot draw on a reservoir of fluid m etal in the sprue channel to com pensate for cooling shrinkage. Shrinkage porosity will then occur within the crown.  1.52.1.3. When using a sprue form er of correct  size, molten metal will continu e to be drawn  into the mold as cooling progresses, and shrink spot porosity will occur in the sprue or reservoir instead. 1.52.2. Attaching the Sprue Former to the Pattern (Figures 1.50 and 1.51):  1.52.2.1. To lessen the possibility of distorting the pattern, always attach the sprue former while the pattern is seated on the die. Attach the sprue  former to the bulkiest part of the pattern at an angle that will create the least am ount of casting turbulence (45 degrees to the axial surfaces of the pattern). Avoid  attaching spru e for mer to anatom ical  features that are  critical to the occlusion you have developed (stamp cusp tips, fossae).  1.52.2.2. When attaching m etal  or plastic sp rue form ers, never heat the sp rue f ormer and plunge it in to the m ass of the pattern because the pattern  will warp.  In stead, jo in the sp rue former to th e pattern with a sm all bead of  sticky wax. Blend the spru e former into the pattern  with additional inlay wax. Before taking the sp rued pattern off the die, add a s mall amount of wax to the contact areas to compensate for metal loss during finishing. 1.52.3. Attaching the Sprued Pattern to the Sprue Base (or Crucible Former) (Figure 1.51-B). Remove the sprued pattern from the d ie. Lute the sprue former to the sprue base, building up or reducing the apex of th e sprue base until the sprue former’s length is 6 to 9 mm  and there is  6 mm clearance between the top of the pattern and e the rim of the casting ring. This space is thAFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  75 thickness of investment needed to prevent metal from breaking out of the m old while casting is in progress. Yet, it is thin enough to let trapped gases escape ahead  of molten m etal entering the mold cavity.  Figure 1.50. Examples of Direct Spruing.  Figure 1.51. Directly Sprued Wax Pattern Attached to a Sprue Base.     1.52.4. Spruing Options. Most sin gle unit castings can be m ade with one direct sprue form er—the only spruing option m entioned so far. A stra ight, unin terrupted sprue channel between th e crucible an d the m old characterizes direct sp ruing. However, below  are a few m ore spruing options: 1.52.4.1.  Auxiliary  Spruing  a  Single  Pattern  (Figure  1.52). For large patterns or those patterns with two thick areas sep arated by a thin  area, use auxiliary sprue form ers (18-gauge wax) to ensure complete casting. 1.52.4.2. Direct Spruing of Multiple, Independent Patterns. When two or more patterns are sprued in direct fashion off of the same sprue base, they should fan out from around the apex of the sprue base. Do not make the sprue former’s lead off one another. When using prefabricated sprue formers with reservoirs, place the reservoirs so they contact each other and are positioned in the center of the ring (thermal zone). Join the contacts between the reservoirs with inlay wax. 1.52.4.3. Indirect Spruing of Multiple, Joined Patterns:  1.52.4.3.1. Indirect spruing is commonly used to cas t multiple single units or units joined together as a splin t or a FPD. In contras t to direct spruing, the sprue channels for indirectly sprued patterns do not lead directly from the crucible to the mold.  76  Figure 1.52. Auxiliary Spruing of Single Patterns.

Note that the 10-gauge patterned sprue formers from the horizontal runner bar to the pattern are offset from  the 8-gauge lead  sprue formers that c onnect the r unner bar to the sprue base. The runner bar is also made of 8-gauge round wax.  chniques f or three unit FPD   1.52.4.3.3. This spruing technique allows molten metal to be cast into the mold so it fills the mold uniform ly and simultaneously, thus elim inating variations th at occur when m olten metal hits different areas of the mold at different times. Indirect spruing increases turbulence (over the direct m ethod) and reduces backpressure  when the m etal is ca st into the mold. It  helps eliminate shrink spot porosity because the feed of molten metal stays open longer. 1.52.4.4. Indirect Spruing of Multiple, Independent Patterns (Figure 1.54). A num ber of patterns that are not joined together are sprued  to a runner bar (as described in the paragraph 1.52.4.3). 1.52.4.5.  Sprued  Pattern  Orientation  Dot. Investigations have show n that the flow of the  molten m etal is downward and to the right of the m old (tra iling edge) as it r otates in a  centrifugal casting m achine. Mark the m old so  it can be o riented to the arm  of t he casting  machine to take advantage of this flow of molte n metal. The two kinds of  patterns that receive maximum benefit from selective orientation of the mold in the casting machine are as follows: AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 1.54. Indirect Spruing of Multiple Independent Patterns. 77  1.52.4.5.1. Single Unit Patterns With a Thin Section. Place a sm all round do t of wax on the sprue base. Position the pattern so the thinnest section (or margins) faces the dot of wax. This dot will late r appear in th e investment and be us ed to orient the  mold to tra il as the casting arm spins. 1.52.4.5.2. Splints and FPDs Being Cast in One Piece.

Prepare the Casting Ring for Investing (Figures 1.51 and 1.55): 1.52.5.1.

Schematic View of a Sprued Pattern in a Casting Ring. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005   1.53. Venting a Sprued Pattern. Venting is a special provision that  permits gas to escape rapidly from the mold cavity ahead of incoming molten metal during the casting procedure  (Figure 1.56). There are “direct” vents (attached directly to patterns) and “blind” vents (not attached). Current theory states that direct vents act m ore like  chill sets and are of lesser im portance than “vents” th at remove gases. Chill sets are wax projection s that radiate heat away fr om the castings and cause the m etal to coo l in a desirable way. The term  chill vent better describes the use  of direct venting.  In Figure 1.54, two 18-gauge wax rods have been placed on the pontic area  of the FPD. Pontic areas  are bulky and chill vents should help to control porosity.  Figure 1.56. Vented Pattern.   AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  1.54. Investing. A sprued pattern is invested  in a casting ring by pouring inve stment material into the ring. 79 1.54.1. Maintaining Cleanliness. Keep all equipment and hand inst ruments used in the investing operation meticulously clean. Keep sprue bases,  spatulas, mixing bowls, m echanical mixers, and water baths free of any dried or  caked investment. A high percenta ge of porosity in gold castings can be attributed to investm ent contam ination.  Particles m ay also cau se the inves tment to set improperly, causing it to be soft and crumble when hot molten metal is cast into the mold. Porosity is also caused by investm ent powder that has ab sorbed m oisture f rom the envir onment. It is important to store investm ent in a tightly covered container. Herm etically sealed bags with individual portion of investment are best. 1.54.2.  Choosing  a  Compensation  System  for  the  Shrinkage  of  Cooling  Gold  (Gypsum-Bonded Investments Only). Cast gold shrinks about 1.4 percent  (± 0.2 percent) when it solidifies from the molten state, and investm ent expansion compensates for this shrinkage. Depending on how they are handled, investments can expand in a number of ways: 1.54.2.1. Kinds of Investment Expansions: 1.54.2.1.1.  Semihygroscopic  or  Effective  Setting  Expansion. This setting expansion (about 0.35 percent) occurs in air when the casting ring contains a wet ring liner. 1.54.2.1.2.  Hygroscopic  Expansion. This setting expansion (about 0.75 percent) occurs when the invested pattern is completely immersed in a warm water bath.  1.54.2.1.3.  Thermal  Expansion. Therm al expansion of the investm ent and m old occurs when it is heated in a burnout oven. Higher heat results in more thermal expansion. 1.54.2.2. Two Popular Systems of Compensating for Cast Gold Shrinkage: 1.54.2.2.1. High Heat Technique. In this system, most of the investment expansion is heat induced. The investm ent bench sets in ai r for 45 m inutes during which sem ihygroscopic oF, during expansion of 0.35 percent occurs. The  pattern wax is then burned out at 1250 which thermal expansion of 1.2 percent occurs . Total expansion for high heat technique is 1.55 percent. 1.54.2.2.2.  Hygroscopic  Technique:  (NOTE:  Most of an investm ent’s expansion is hygroscopic.) 1.54.2.2.2.1. First, the  investment sets under 100  oF water for 30 to 45 m inutes, during which hygroscopic expansion of 0.75 percent  occurs. Pattern wax expansion from  room temperature (72  oF) to 100  oF is 0.3 percent. T hen, the pa ttern is burned  out at 900  oF, during which therm al expansion of  0.55 perc ent tak es p lace. Tota l e xpansion of  the  hygroscopic technique is 1.60 percent.  1.54.2.2.2.2. Advantages claimed for the hygroscopic compensation method over the high heat technique are that the m ethod gives smoother castings, prolongs the life of furnaces and casting rings, and gives finer grain structure to the solidified gold.  1.54.2.2.2.3. Som e brands of investm ent are specially compounded for use in the hygroscopic method while others w ork best in  the high heat techni que. Always read the manufacturer’s directions. 1.54.3.  Preparing  the  Water  and  Investment  Powder. Use the water-to-powder ratio recommended by the m anufacturer. Recommended ratios will f all within a narrow range. W hen selecting from this range, keep in mind that less water in the mix will give greater mold expansion. 80  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 1.54.3.1. Distilled Water. The water should be carefully m easured. Using only distilled water, pre-wet the bowl. ( NOTE: A significant percentage of the water can b e consumed in wetting  the mixing bowl and not become incorporated into the mixed mass.) Do not leave excess water  be sure it is damp. W ater temperature should be about 70  oF. on the surface of the bowl, butRoom temperature water can vary according to th e area within the laboratory and the season of the year. Water that is too war m or too cool is  one of the greatest con tributing factors to th e distortion of the wax pattern during the investing process. Use only distilled water. 1.54.3.2.  Investment  Powder. If not using a prepackaged investm ent, be sure to weigh the investment powder accurately.  1.54.4. Investing a Pattern. There are two basic ways to invest a pattern—mechanical mixing the investment under vacuum and hand-mixing (investing). No matter which method you use, the first step is to pour water into the mixing bowl and then slowly add the powder. Incorporate the powder and water with a hand spatula so no dry powder or large lumps are visible. 1.54.4.1. Mechanical Mixing Under Vacuum (Figure 1.57): 1.54.4.1.1. After incorp orating the powder a nd water with a hand spatula, place th e lid on the bowl and ensure it is tightly closed. 1.54.4.1.2. Connect the vacuum  tubing. Slip the  metal trap cap at the e nd of the tubing into its opening on the top of the lid. 1.54.4.1.3. Position the vacuum  spatulator so  the agita tor’s drive nut e ngages the m otor’s drive chuck . Star t the  unit.  Spatulate   for the length of timmanufacturer (Figure 1.57-A). Then disengage the spatulator. e recommended by the  Figure 1.57. Investing With a Vacuum Spatulator.   1.54.4.1.4. Release the vacuum , but let the uni t run for 1 more m inute to flush water vapor from the pump and re-oil the motor. 1.54.4.1.5. Use a brush or instrument and mild vibration to flow a mix of investment over all the pattern’s surfaces an d into the cavity of the pattern (Figure 1.57-B). Take care not to incorporate air bubbles. Do not touch the pattern with the brush or instrum ent. Instead, vibrate a brush load of investm ent ahead of th e brush’s bristles until the pattern is covered. When done properly, precoating a pattern in this way helps ensure a bubble-free casting. 1.54.4.1.6. Place the ring carefully  on the sprue base and pour the investment around the  pattern (Figure 1.57-C). This is done by pourin g investment down the  side of the ring and allowing it to rise around the pattern. While the ring is being filled, hold it in the hand that is rested on the vibrator plate. The vibrations cause the ring to fill evenly without trapping air. If the hygroscopic technique is  being used, submerge the ring in  a water bath (Figure 1.58). If not, let the investment bench set. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005   Figure 1.58. Hygroscopic Expansion Water Bath. 1.54.4.1.7. Wash m ixer parts, lid, bowl, a nd hand spatula thoroughly  under running water before the investment has a chance to set. 81  1.54.4.2. Hand-Investing. If powe red mechanical spatulators and vacuum  equipment are not available, a pattern can be hand-invested as follows:  the m ix to stay in the bottom of  the bowl and f acilitates and spatulate th e contents with a hand 1.54.4.2.1. Place the mixing bowl on a vibrator spatula. The vibration causes thorough mixing. Mild vibration will also act to remove most air bubbles.  1.54.4.2.2. At the very least, m ost laboratories have a hand-driven m echanical spatulator. If using one of these devices, start the m ix with a hand spatula and finish it with the hand-cranked unit. The num ber of turns of the  handle is im portant. Follow the m anufacturer’s directions b ecause d ifferences in the am ount  of spatulation cause v ariations in  setting expansion. Gently vibrate the mix to liberate trapped air. 1.54.4.2.3. The investm ent can now be adde1.54.4.1.5 and 1.54.4.1.6. d to the ring as described in paragraphs 1.54.5. Investment Setting Time: 1.54.5.1. Investment Destined for High Heat Pattern Burnout. A m inimum setting tim e of 45 minutes (1 to 1.5 hours is be st) is critical to  developing sufficient  semihygroscopic setting expansion and ensuring adequate strength. Be sure  the invested pattern is allowed to stand on a bench where there is no vibrati on. If the investm ent is subjected  to v ibration during the initia l setting period, a cracked mold or rough casting can result. 1.54.5.2.  Hygroscopic  Investment  Expansion. Af ter inve sting (and while th e in vestment is  still wet), s ubmerge the ring in 100   oF water for 45 m inutes. It  may remain in water up to 3 hours. Do not subject the investment to vibration while it is setting. 1.54.6. Removing the Sprue Base and Sprue Former: 1.54.6.1. Once the investm ent has set for the re commended length of time , carefully twist of f the sprue base in a single motion and free it from the investment and sprue former. Remove any excess inv estment f rom the ends a nd side of  the ring so it will fit p roperly in th e casting machine.  82  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 1.54.6.2. Break the glaze at the top of the ring so gases generated by pattern burnout can escape readily (F igure 1.59). Ensure th e crucib le po rtion of  the  m old is clean and free of loose investment particles.   Figure 1.59. Breaking the Top Surface Glaze of the Set Investment.   1.54.6.3. Metal sprues form ers must be rem oved before wax pattern burnout; wax and plastic sprue formers do not. To remove a metal sprue former, warm it through contact with a hot pair of pliers, invert the casting ring with the crucible downward, and  rotate the sprue former out of the mold with the plie rs. From this point until  the casting is m ade, keep the ring inverted to prevent particles of investm ent or other debris from  falling into  the sprue hole. Deb ris in the mold causes gross casting defects. 1.54.7. Storing Invested Patterns:  1.54.7.1. Invested patterns usually go directly  into the burnout oven after the investm ent sets. Occasionally, though, invested patterns cannot be burned out imm ediately so they m ust be stored overnight or longer.  1.54.7.2. Do not let set investments dry out. Water must be present in the investment to conduct heat evenly throughout a m old. When a mold is dry, the outer e dges nearest the heated furnace walls can becom e much hotter than the m old’s inner core. The investm ent may c rack under these conditions.  1.54.7.3. Store invested patterns in a hum id atmosphere. Wrap them in a damp towel and keep them in a plastic bag that contains a few drops of  water. If a ring dries out, soak it in water for 10 or 15 minutes before placing it in a burnout furnace. 1.55. Wax Elimination (Burnout): 1.55.1. Overview. Wax elimination (burnout) is used to elim inate all moisture from  the invested ring. It is also used to e liminate the wax or plastic used to form  the pattern from  the mold cavity.  The heat ex pands the mold cavity  to com pensate for allo y shrink age during  solidification and cooling and raises the mold to the proper temperature to receive molten alloy. Controlled burnout prevents damage to the investm ent from overheating. Uncontrolled burnout causes breakdown of AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  83 the mold’s walls and p ossible sulfur contamination of the alloy. Sulfur c ontamination renders the alloy weak and brittle. 1.55.2. Calibrating the Burnout Furnace’s Temperature Indicator: 1.55.2.1. Every burnout furnace sho uld have  a good pyrometer and ind icator. The pyrom eter (or thermocouple) consists of a pair of dissi milar wires welded together at the couple tip. The wires project into the furnace’s burnout chamber (muffle). Contamination of the wires by gases released in the muffle and exposure to continued high temperatures changes the thermocouple’s behavior characteristics.  1.55.2.2. Because the th ermocouple is directly  responsible for the read ings on the tem perature indicator, the readings tend to lose their accura cy. Therefore, tem perature readings should be checked m onthly. One m ethod is to use a co mmercially prepared pellet m ade fr om m etal oxides. The pellet fuses  and flows when its m elting point is reached. The accuracy of these pellets is within 1 percent of their rated melting temperatures. Pellets may be obtained that melt at almost any tem perature up to 2400  oF. The pelle ts com e f rom the m anufacturer with f ull directions for use. 1.55.3. Placing Rings in the Furnace: 1.55.3.1. Make sure the ring is dam p when placing it in the furnace to  minimize the possibility of cracking. Soak rings that have dried overn ight (or longer) in water for 15 m inutes before placing them in the furnace. 1.55.3.2. Place a tray in the botto m of the muffle for the rings to sit on. The tray will retain the molten wax that flows out of the mold cavity and keep it from soaking through the muffle floor where it could damage the heating element. An alternative is to line the floor of the muffle with asbestos-substitute strips. 1.55.3.3. Place the rings in the center of the furnace toward the back wall when possible (Figure 1.60). The temperature in different parts of the o ven may vary and this p lacement ensures that the furnace atm osphere surrounding  the ring is th e sam e as that reco rded by the pyrom eter indicator.  Figure 1.60. Placement of Rings in the Burnout Furnace.   84  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 1.55.3.4. Place the m old in the oven with the sprue hole down. Elevate one edge of the ring upward by resting it on a sm all piece of ceramic material. (This is not necessary if the burnout furnace has a firing pla tform with channels in it .) Molten w ax will flow out of the mold as it melts and air will pass m ore freely into the  mold cavity to ensure com plete burnout of all residual carbon. 1.55.4. Controlling Burnout Time and Temperature: 1.55.4.1. High Heat Technique. Use the high heat technique with investments that have bench oF. set in air and sem ihygroscopically expanded. The burnout  tem perature is 1250 to 1275 Starting with a cool ov en, the furn ace takes ab out 1 hour to reach  burnout tem perature. After reaching burnout temperature, heat soak the m old for ano ther hour. Total tim e in th e oven is about 2 hours. Do not raise the tem perature above 1300 oF because it will cause the in vestment material to break down, which causes rough castings. Excessive burnout tem peratures also produce sulfur gases that mix with gold alloys and make castings brittle. Do not use the oven to burn out new molds until its temperature has dropped to at least 900 oF. 1.55.4.2. Low Heat Technique. Low heat burnout is used in combination with investments that have been hygroscopically expanded in a wa ter bath. The burnout tem perature is 900  oF. Heat the mold from room temperature to 900  oF or place it d irectly in th e furnace at 90 0 oF. After reaching burnout temperature, heat soak the m old for 1 hour. Total tim e in the oven is about 2  hours when starting with a room  temperature furnace. However, only half the tim e is needed with a preheated furnace. Som e c laim low  heat burnout produces fi ner grained, stronger castings than the high  heat techn ique. Using   equipment at lower tem peratures generally prolongs its life. 1.55.4.3. Factors Influencing Burnout Time and Temperature. Do not rush burnout. If an error is m ade in burnout tim e, be sure it is on the long side rather than on the short side, as follows: 1.55.4.3.1.  Temperature  Rise  Time. The tim e from  room  tem perature to the desired burnout temperature should not be less than 1 hour. 1.55.4.3.2.  Number  and  Size  of  the  Molds. Allow an addition al 10  m inutes for each  additional m old. (Use an addition al 20 m inutes f or larger m olds.) Calculate burno ut time from the time the last mold is placed in the oven. 1.55.4.3.3. Preheated Oven. Using a preheated oven does not significantly decrease burnout time. At the start of the burnout  cycle, the temperature of the investment is much lower than the atm osphere of the furnace. The tim e it w ould take the m old to reach the preheated temperature is about the same as the tim e it would take a room  temperature oven and mold to rise simultaneously to the preheated tem perature. Therefore, burnout time stays about the same whether the ring is initially placed in a room temperature furnace or in a preheated  oven. 1.55.4.3.4.  Plastic  Patterns. Molds containing pl astic patterns m ust burn out slow er and longer. The initial burnout temperature should not exceed 600 oF for the first 30 minutes. 1.56.  Casting  With  a  Gas-Air  Torch  and  Centrifugal  Casting  Machine.  (NOTE:  There are m ore sophisticated, electrical methods of melting and casting gold alloys. If you are going to use an electrical device in the casting process, be sure to folloequipment.) This method uses direct application of heat with a blowtorch to melt an alloy before casting as follows: w the manufacturer’s directions for operating the AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  85 ting 1.56.1.  Balance  the  Machine. Keep a “dummy” casting ring available to balance the casmachine. 1.56.2. Prepare the Crucible. There are th ree types of availab le casting crucibles; clay, quartz,  and aluminum oxide. Clay crucibles must be glazed by sprin kling powdered flux ins ide them and heat with a casting to rch. The alternative appro ach would be to sim ply use a quartz or alum inum oxide crucible. These crucibles are self-glazing if they are sufficiently heated with a torch. 1.56.3. Determine the Amount of Alloy Needed. The amount of alloy re quired for a casting is dictated by the pattern’s  weight. Ideally, you sh ould not cast a button when  using a reservo ir. A button is an y additional cast alloy beyond the spru e. To d etermine the am ount of alloy needed, weigh the patterns with attached sprue former. Then multiply that weight times the specific gravity of the alloy being used. The product  is the amount of alloy needed  to cast. For example, .6 gram s (weight of patterns and sprue form er) times 15.5 (specific gravity of the alloy) equals 9.3 gram s. Thus, you would cast 9.3 grams of alloy. 1.56.4.  Select  the  Metal  Needed. Use either new alloy  or a  combination of n ew alloy  an d previously cast alloy for a casting.properties of such blends are unpredictable. When using previously cast alloy, com bine it with at least 50 percent new gold alloy. Thoroughly m icroblast previously cast all oy before reusing it. When necessary to com bine small pieces of all oy or rem ove impurities from a button, m elt the alloy in a depression on a charcoal block with th e reducing part of a blowtorch flame. Sprinkle a  reducing flux over the m olten metal to remove the oxid es and impurities. Prevent reoxidation by shutting off the a ir to th e torch and playing the gas flame over th e alloy to e xclude air until th e alloy solidifies. 1.56.5. Wind the Casting Machine. Allow three to four turns to  generate enough casting force. Use more turns for small masses of metal and a lower number for large masses. Raise the stop rod from the base of the m achine and rest the m ain arm against it. The press ure of the arm holds the rod in an elevated position. The arm will not rotate as long as the stop rod is up. 1.56.6. Adjust the Torch Flame:   Do not m ix  brands or types of alloy because the physical 1.56.6.1.

L ight the  tor ch with onl y gas flowing. Incorporate progr essively m ore air in to the  gaseous m ix until a pointed flam e showing two  “cones” develops (Figure 1.61). The outer cone, called the redu cing zone, is  the part of the flam e that c onsists of burning gas. The inner cone, called the combustion zone, is unburned gas of a low temperature.   Figure 1.61. Parts of a Gas-Air Torch Flame.   86  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 1.56.6.2. Melting must be done in the reducing z one of the flam e lying between the tips of the inner and outer cones. This portion should be large enough to cover the button of gold alloy used.  1.56.6.3. Taken as a whole, the flam e should al ways have a reducing nature. This m eans the flame has a  supply of gas som ewhat larger than  the available air can co mpletely burn. If the  flame does not have this reducing character, excess oxygen will oxidize base metals in the alloy and raise the alloy’s m elting te mperature to a poin is  im possible to m elt it satisfactorily. t where it1.56.7. Preheat the Crucible. Preheat the crucible with the  torch. This ensures a cold spot does not develop at the base of the alloy as it is being melted. 1.56.8.  Melt  the  Gold  and  Apply  Flux. Place the required a mount of alloy in the preheated crucible. M elt th e alloy  with the re ducing zone  of the flame. If a signifi cant oxide film for ms, sprinkle a sm all amount of casting flux onto the su rface of the alloy. If the m etal is clean and  uncontaminated, this should be th e only time you use flux. Never  add flux once the ring has been positioned in the cas ting machine. The rush of  gas out of  the tor ch could blow th e flux into the mold and cause it to become part of the casting. 1.56.9. Position the Ring in the Casting Machine (Figure 1.62). Maintain the alloy in as molten a state as po ssible. Remove the  burned out m old from the oven. In sert the ring  into the m achine with the sp rue hole tow ard the cruc ible and ens ure the orientation dot is positioned toward the trailing edge of the rotation of the casting machine. Move the crucible into contact with the ring. 1.56.10. Heat the Alloy to Casting Condition. The exact tim e of casting the alloy into the m old cavity is determ ined by appearance. The gold all oy is rea dy to cast when it exh ibits a m obile, bright, mirror-like surface. 1.56.11. Make the Casting. Grasp the arm of the machine firmly, move it away from the stop rod, and let the rod drop back into the base. Release the arm and make the cast, hold ing the flame on the gold until the crucible starts to rotate. Release the casting arm smoothly. Do not allow it to jerk because molten metal spills can result. 1.56.12.  Recover  the  Casting  From  the  Mold. When the m achine stops spinnin g, remove t he mold and place it on a bench top. Allow it to bench cool completely before dives ting. Push the investment out of the ring and break away the bulk of investment surrounding the castings. 1.57. Cleaning and Pickling (Deoxidizing) the Casting: 1.57.1.  Cleaning. Use a stiff brush under running water to rem ove adhering investm ent. A microblaster with glass beads under low pressure may also be used to remove investment from the outer casting surface, while alum inum oxide may be  used to rem ove investment from the inner casting surface. Use caution not to use too much air pressure or abrade the m argins of the casting with the microblasting process (Figure 1.63). 1.57.2. Pickling (Figure 1.64): 1.57.2.1. Pickling consists of chemically removing oxides from a casting. A 50-percent solution of hydrochloric acid is frequecommercial pickling p reparations available.

Keep all pickling soluti ons in c learly labe led, plas tic bottles  with  plastic caps.  1.57.3.2. When m aking an acid pickling solution, NEVER pour the water into the acid  because the chemical reaction is violent and the acid will splatter. The antidote for an acid bu rn is to ap ply baking soda to the affected area im mediately after contact. In the absence of a specific chem ical neutralizer for a pickling agen t, the best course of action is to liberally flush the affected area with water.  1.57.3.3. One of the first rules of safety durieyeglasses. Do not boil pickling ag ents; they  tend to foam and splatter unexpectedly when boiled. A thermostatically controlled electric heater will eliminate this hazard.

ALWAYS pour the acid into the water. ng the pickling procedure is to wear p rotective AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  1.58. Finishing and Polishing the Casting. The finishing of a casting cons ists of inspecting the casting for defects, removing the sprue, test-fitting the cas ting on the die, rough-finishing th e casting’s surface, checking the contact areas, adjusting the occlusion, and polishing (Figure 1.65-A through 1.65-L): 89 1.58.1. Inspecting the Casting for Defects. If possible, us e magnification to check  the casting ’s surfaces. The casting should be smooth, dense, and complete. There are two major kinds of defects to look for, positiv e and negative. Bubbles of metal  or fins that protrud e from a casting’s surface are called  positive  defects. Poros ity, holes, an d incom plete castings are classified  as  negative defects. Holes can sometimes be soldered closed. Porosity and incomplete castings usually means starting over. Before a casting can be test-fitted on its die, free the internal surface of the casting of all positive defects. It is highly  recommended that a m icroscope is  used in this process. Rem ove nodules and fins with a round carbide bur of adequate  size in relation to the defect. Never grind or polish a casting’s internal surface. 1.58.2. Removing the Sprue. Remove sprues with a separating  disk (Figure 1.65-A ). Be careful to avoid cutting into the body of the casting or dam aging the fine  margins. Leave  a little of the sprue on the casting to permit proper recontouring of the area. 1.58.3.  Test-Fitting  the  Casting  on  the  Die. Exam ine the intern al s urface of the casting for positive defects under m icroscopic view and elim inate any defects (Figure 1.65-B). After all internal surface positive defects have been removed, carefully place the casting on the die (Figure 1.65-C). There is serious potential for die damage when a casting is test fitted. If a casting does not fit, don’t force it because the pattern  cannot be rem ade if the die is dam aged. The casting should  seat com pletely without undue pressure. It should  be stable on the die and the m argin of t he casting should conform perfectly to the m argin of  the d ie. If the cas ting does not seat, try to determine the cause and check f or positive defects that might remain. If the casting  is warped o r otherwise distorted, reject it and s tart over. Once the casting is accu rately seated on the die, go to  the next step. 1.58.4. Rough-Finishing the Casting’s Surface: 1.58.4.1. Finishing and polishing can be done rapidly and effectively  only by well-organized use of progressively finer abrasive and polishing agents. Be careful not to damage the casting. 1.58.4.2. Shape the sprue stum p into the genera l contour of the ca sting with a he atless stone (Figure 1.65-D) followed by a #203 stone. 1.58.4.3. Sharpen the occlusal anatomy by using a small, dulled round bur (Figure 1.65-E). 1.58.4.4. Go over the entire casting with fine stones (Figure 1.65-F) and rubber abrasive wheels (Figure 1.65-G) and points (in that order). Depending on the roughness of the casting, start with the finest abrasive that does the job. Sm ooth and contour all axial surfaces, from the tips of the cusps to within 1 mm of the margins. Be careful not to grind away proximal contours in contact areas. This could cause loss of contact with  adjacent teeth and/or loss of contact with opposing teeth. 1.58.5. Adjusting Proximal Contacts. When a casting has  mesial and distal p roximal contacts, adjust them one at a tim e. At the tim e the working cast was made, the natural teeth adjacen t to a preparation site we re a lso made removable with dowel pins. Place  the  die in the  working cas t, remove one of the teeth next to the die, try to seat the casting on its die, and carefully rem ove contact excess with a ru bber abrasive wheel. Us e a piece of articulating  film between the crown  and adjacen t teeth to d isclose exces sive contact areas (Figu re 1.65-H). After the casting seats, follow the sam e procedure for the other con tact. Finally, check the proxim al contacts with both adjacent dies in place to ensure proper contact (Figure 1.65-I). 90  Figure 1.65. Finishing and Polishing a Casting for Try-In. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005   1.58.6. Adjusting the Occlusion. Place each working cas t in positio n in the articulato r. Seat the casting on the die. Restore the vertical dim ension of occlusion fi rst. Use articu lating f ilm to disclose high spots on the casting (Figure 1.65-J).  Preserve the occlusal anatom y when grinding these spots.  Af ter re storing the v ertical d imension of occlusion, check  the cas ting’s eccentric relations with opposing teeth. The casting should c onform to the occlusion schem e chosen for the wax pattern (anterior guidance,  group function, etc.).  Maxillary stam p cusps should not contact  between upper and low er teeth on  the balancing side. Perf orm a final sm oothing of the casting with rubber wheels and points (Figure 1.65-K). Re member to stay about 1 mm a way from the  margins. 1.58.7. Polishing the Casting. The m aterials used for final  polishing are buffing bar com pound (BBC), rouge, soft bristle brushes, and (som etimes) mandrel mounted felt wheels and a cham ois. The BBC and rouge are polishing agents used together with an appropriate wheel or brush to shine a casting. BBC is the coarser of the two. Polishing  starts with BBC on a  soft bristle brush or felt  wheel and continues with rouge on a soft bristle brush or felt wheel (Figure 1.65-L). An extremely high luster results when rouge is applied to a casting with a chamois wheel. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  91 1.58.7.1. Preliminary Polish. The d entist will tr y the castin g in the patient’s mouth after the occlusion has been corrected in the articulator and will probabley modify the proximal contacts and adjust the occlusio n. In effect, a casting  is finished and polished twice—once before and once after the try-in. The casting’s occlusal surface is the portion most likely to be modified. It makes sense to anticip ate this  and  not carry   polishing of the occlus al surface to com pletion before try-in. For a pre-try-in polish, high shine all axial surfaces and leave a satin finish on the occlusal. Som e dentists  prefer a matte-finishe d occlusal su rface becau se it is easier to see interferences on a casting in  the patient’s m outh against a  dull background than a shiny one. The matte finish is produced with a mini-sandblaster. 1.58.7.2. Final Polish (Figure 1.66): 1.58.7.2.1. Remove any gross scratches the dentist might have produced and give the casting its final polish. If the dentist did not finish the margins during try-in, the technician will do so now.  1.58.7.2.2. Some technicians finish the m argins with the casting seated on the die; others prefer to finish them off the die. Neither m ethod completely assures the margins will not be abraded, so use extrem e care. W HEN FINISHING AND P OLISHING MARGIN AREAS,  ALL ROTARY INSTRUMENTS USED MARGINS (Figure 1.66).

The dentist hing com pounds with soap and water or by   Section 1L—FPDs (Retainers, Pontics, and Connectors) 1.59. Overview: 1.59.1. An FPD is a rep lacement for missing natural teeth that is cemented to existing teeth in the patient’s mouth. Once cemented, an FPD cannot be removed without a great deal of difficulty.  1.59.2. An FPD is composed of two kinds of units, retainers and pontics, and the unit castings are jointed together by connectors (Figure 1.67).  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 92   Figure 1.67. Parts of an FPD.   1.59.3. The dentist prepares (reduces the tooth structure) an adequate  number of natural teeth adjacent to an edentulous space to provide eno ugh support and retention for the FPD. The natu ral teeth the dentist prepares are  abutments. Metal castings (on lays, complete crowns) are m ade to replace what the dentist reduces on the abutment teeth. These castings are retainers.  1.59.4. A  pontic is an a rtificial tooth suspended from the retainer castings. A pontic  occupies the space formerly occupied by a natural tooth and is attached to a retainer by a connector.  1.59.5. Connectors can be rigid or nonrigid. There are two types of rigid connectors—solder joints and cast jo ints (multiple wax patterns joined with wax at th eir proximal surfaces an d cast as one piece). Nonrigid connectors take the form of key and keyway interlocking parts (patrix and matrix interlocking parts, respectively). 1.60. FPD Designs:  1.60.1. The typical FPD consists of one or m ore pontics rigidly suspended between two retainers,  one on each side of the edentulous space. Norm ally, an a butment at both ends will support an FPD, but there are special situations where this requirem ent  is waived. W hen a pontic is suspended from only one retainer, it is cantilevered.  1.60.2. The best example of a cantilever FPD involves replacement of the maxillary lateral incisor, when the adjacent central incisor and canine are still present. In some cases, the dentist chooses to preserve the central incisor and does not prepare it as an abutment. The prosthesis will then consist of a canine retainer and  a lateral incisor pont ic. The reasoning behind this  compromise is that the maxillary canine is v ery strong and  can bear ch ewing loads for itself and for a small, relativ ely nonfunctional lateral incisor pontic. 1.60.3. The dentist is obligated  to prepare enough teeth to provide  adequate support for an FPD,  usually at least two. For long span FPDs (four units or more) or in cases where potential abutment teeth are somewhat mobile, the dentist might prepare more than two teeth as abutm ents. When a t, join ted re tainers, the prosth esis is s aid to  have  double pontic is attached to two adjacenabutments. It is possible to have double abutments on both ends of the prosthesis. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  93 1.60.4. There are p atterns of natural too th loss where two edentulous sp aces are s eparated by an intervening tooth, and at leas t one tooth rem ains distal to the posterior  edentulous space (Figure 1.68). When an FPD is m ade to bridge the two  edentulous spaces, th e intervening tooth will be  prepared as an abutm ent. On this kin d of FPD,  the most mesial and the m ost distal abutments are called primary abutments and the intervening tooth is called an intermediate abutment or pier.  Figure 1.68. Intermediate Abutment.   1.60.5. Rigid connection between all units of an  FPD is recommended most of the time. However, a key to keyway, nonrigid connector, placed between one retainer and  pontic, is an acceptable alteration in design for special situations.  1.60.6. For example, rigid connectors cannot be us ed between all units of a case where the dentis t is unable to prepare the abutment teeth with a path of insertion common to all of the abutments. In another example, maxillary FPDs with canine  intermediate abutments tend to bre ak loose f rom their abutments when all of the c onnectors are rigid. (This kind of pr osthesis “turns the corner” of the m axillary arch and the abutm ents are  subje cted to unu sual stress es.) To “brea k” or redu ce stress, a dentist might decide to prescribe a nonrigid connector distal to the canine. 1.61. Steps in FPD Construction. For steps in FPD construction, see Figure 1.69 and as follows: 1.61.1. Make working casts with removable dies. 1.61.2. Mount the casts and trim the dies. 1.61.3. Wax the retainer and pontic patterns. 1.61.4. Sprue, invest, and cast the patterns. 1.61.5. Seat the casting, desprue, and solder the FPD, if necessary. 1.61.6. Satin finish the castings and adjust the occlusion. 1.61.7. Veneer the castings with applications of porcelain or acrylic resin, if prescribed. 1.61.8. Polish the completed restoration. 1.62.  Materials  Used  in  Making  FPDs. The units of an FPD may be  made entirely f rom m etal, a combination of m etal and acrylic re sin, or a com bination of m etal an d porcelain.  To satisf y esthe tic requirements, use appropriate laboratory equipment to veneer retainers and pon tics with porcelain fused to metal or with acrylic resin processed to metal. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 94  1.63.  Retainer  Construction.  The dentist determ ines the type of reabutment teeth accordingly. The m ost commonly used retainers are complete crowns, partial crowns, and onlays. Retainers, regardless  of their fin ished com position, st art out as wax patterns. T he only exception is  som e all-ceram ic system s that do  not  use the lost wax techniqu e. Section 1I addresses construction of wax patterns for individual restorations. Use Section 1I to construct the retainers because the directions for retainer patterns are e ssentially the same as sing le unit construction. Basic patterns must be modified when retainers are programmed for acrylic resin or porcelain application. (See Chapter 2 of this volume for ceramic veneers and Chapter 5 of this volume for acrylic resin veneers.)  Figure 1.69.

Although most of a typical pontic conform s t o the  shape of the tooth it is replacing, the linguogingival one-third to one-half has to deviate from a crown’s natural shape for hygenic reasons. A pontic that duplicates a crown’s na tural shape exactly woul d lap over (saddle) the residual ridge from  facial to lingual, and this kind  of broad coverage is very  unhealthy. It fosters food debris retention and gingival tissu e inflammation. As much as possi ble, construct pontics with rounded contours, avoiding sharp angles, whic h are harder to floss and prom ote debris retention. The following three types of pontic design are generally used: 1.64.1. Modified Ridgelap. The style of gingival adaptation most universally used is the modified ridgelap (Figure 1.70). The modified ridgelap closely resembles the shape of a natural tooth from the facial view. It is the shape of choice for maxillary anterior, maxillary posterior, and mandibular anterior pontics. It is also used for m andibular posterior pontics when there is  sufficient bu ccal sulcus depth. Contact with the residual ridge sh ould extend no farther lingua lly than the crest of the ridge. (An ideal area of contact between a m odified ridgelap pontic and the residual ridge is illustrated in Figure 1.71.)  Figure 1.70. Modified Ridgelap Pontic Forms.   96  Figure 1.71. Modified Ridgelap Pontic Gingival Contact Area. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005   1.64.2. Conical (Figure 1.72). If ridge reso rption is slight to  moderate and the bu ccal sulcus is shallow, the  conica l po ntic is sub stituted f or the modified ridgelap form. The concern is th at a pontic with a facial lap m ight  impinge on an active, shallow su lcus. The gingival half of the conical pontic is form ed into an “egg” shape,  both mesiodistally and buc colingually with a ridge contact area localized to a small spot on the crest of the ridge.  Figure 1.72. Conical Pontic Design.   1.64.3. Hygienic (Figure 1.73). When ridge resorption is very fa r advanced the hygienic pontic is used. The hygienic pontic has no contact with th e ridge and is suspended a m inimum of 2 mm (and not more than 4 mm) over the crest of the ri dge. An alternative design of the hygienic pontic  also appears in Figure 1.73 and is called the archway (modified) pontic. Proponents claim  that because of this pontic’s shape, it is easier to clean and has more strength in the connector areas. 1.65. Pontic Construction (Figure 1.69). As a genera l guideline, first fabricate the pontic ’s full axial and gingival contours in wax. Rigid  (wax) connector areas may be for med at this time. (Connectors are discussed in depth in paragraph 1.68). Next, wax the occlusal surface and establish occlusal contacts. If the dentist prescribes a veneered  surface, modify the pattern for the veneered su rface at th is time. (See Chapter 2 of this volume for ceram ic veneers and Ch apter 5 of this volum e for acr ylic resin veneers.) Use one of several pontic designs discussed in paragraph 1.64 while fabricating an FPD.  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 1.73.

Facial Surface (Figure 1.74):  teeth will h elp m aintain gi ngival health by shunting food 1.65.2.1. One of the m ore important considerations affecting a pon tic’s appearance is its facial surface length. Pontics that are too long or too short do not blend well with natural dentition. It is not enough to m ake a pontic just as long as th e natural tooth it is replacing. For an observer to get an acceptable visual impression of facial surface length, the pontic’s cervical line as well as the f acio-occlusal or  incisal edg e will have to f all in the right plac es rela tive to adjace nt teeth. 1.65.2.2. There are two m ethods of developing an  acceptable visual impr ession of a pontic’s cervical pos ition as rid ge resorp tion increas es. One  is to m ake the gi ngival half of a facial surface more convex than usual. The other is to deviate from the normal long axis alignment by depressing the neck of the pontic. F requently, both of these methods are used at the sam e time. When ridge resorption is slight to moderate, depend more on depressing the neck than changing gingivofacial convexity to achieve the desired cerv ical line effect. If a ridge is substantially resorbed, th ere is little  choi ce but to do both. Given that resorption is far advanced, a conventional FPD may not be indicated. 1.65.2.3. When possible, working and protrusi ve movement contacts should be borne by the natural teeth, not a pontic. This is o ne control  over a pontic’s facio-occlusal or facio-incisal length. Another control is how the facial edge  lines up with the rem aining teeth. Extend the  facial cusp ridges of a posterior pon tic or the in cisal edge of an anterior pontic as far as these controls allow. Many frustrating situations will arise where a pont ic’s facio-occlusal or incisal edge is oriented at just the right level to look good in a patient’s mouth, but the pontic’s vertical overlap causes it to have contacts in working and protrusive excursions. Decreasing the vertical overlap o r increas ing h orizontal ov erlap will reduce or elim inate the force of the excursiv e contacts, but it also compromises the pontic’s appearance. It is up to the dentist to give specific advice in these cases. 98  Figure 1.74. Positioning the Cervical Line of an Anterior Pontic.

When the  mesiodistal width of an edentu lous space is greater than the tooth extracted from the spot, the facial aspect of an oversized pontic is shaped to produce a mesiodistally convex surface that scatters reflected light rays and gives the illusion of being a narrower pon tic than it is . When teeth adjacent to a space have drifted to  make the space narrower than the natural tooth was, the facial  surface of the pontic is flattened to reflect more light straight back into the viewer’s eyes and create an illusion of a wider pontic.  Figure 1.75. Mesiodistal Convexity. 1.65.3. Lingual Surface: 1.65.3.1.  Anterior  Pontics. An anterior pontic’s lingual contours, down to the junction between its middle and gingival thirds, should more or less im itate adjacent natural teeth. As a  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  99 ng and protrusive contact s; it is bette r tha t general rule, anterior pontics do not have workinatural teeth bear such loading. This  means vertical and horizontal overlap must be controlled, often to the detrim ent of the pontic’s appear ance. The lingual height  of contour is roughly located at the junction of the pontic’s gingival and middle thirds. The lingual surface below the height of contour tapers in toward the crest of the ridge where initial contact with the ridge is made. 1.65.3.2.  Posterior  Pontics. The shape of the occlusal half of a posterior pontic’s lingual surface sho uld conform to accep ted food-sh unting  standards for retain ers. Th e height of contour is located at the junction between the pontic’s occlusal and gingival halves. The lingual surface below the height of contour tapers in tow ard the crest of the ridge where initial contact with the ridge is made. 1.65.4.  Proximal  Surfaces. Mes iodistally, a p ontic is con structed to f ill the ed entulous spa ce. However, embrasures between pontic and retainer  units of an FPD should be sufficiently open to allow effective cleaning. If the e mbrasures ar e too open, they become obvious to the casual observer and represent gross food traps. 1.66. Pontic Occlusion. Pontics must function or occlude ag ainst opposing teeth according to the same  rules as individual cast restorations with one si gnificant exception—pontics should clear opposing teeth in working and protrusive excursions no m atter what kind of occlusion scheme is involved. The limit of acceptability in this regard is  light contact. An extension of this principle is that no pontic should bear the burden of anterior guidance. T o the extent possible, working and protrusive excu rsion contacts should be borne by well supported natural teeth. When not possible, consult the dentist. 1.67.  Pontic  Occlusal  Surface  Area. The occlusal surface area of po ntics shou ld be the sam e as or  slightly narrower than the adjacent teeth. (Pontics should not be arbitrarily narrowed by a set percentage as was taught in the past.) A narrowed occlusal surface is sometimes compared to a malposed tooth that cannot shunt food properly. It is cons idered a poor practice,  which results in soft  tissue dam age in the edentulous space. One m ethod of checking th e facial -lingual width is to m easure the corresp onding natural teeth using a Boley gauge. Rem ember, the occlusal table width (b uccal cusp tip to lingual cusp tip) represents just a frac tion of the total buccal-li ngual width of teeth (F igure 1.76). The m istake made most often is to unknowingly widen the occlusal table by placing the cusps too far apart.  Figure 1.76. Occlusal Table Width Compared to Overall Buccal-Lingual Width.  1.68.  FPD  Connectors. The various m eans used to join fi xed prosthodontic units  are single-piece casting, nonrigid (stress breaker) connectors, and soldering, as follows:  100  1.68.1. Single-Piece Casting (Figure 1.77):  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 1.68.1.1. One way to fabricate an FPD is to c onnect all units during the wax-up and cast it into a single piece. This method is widely used, but re quires the technician to pay close attention to the fit of the wax-up on the stone dies prior to sp ruing and casting in order to achieve a solid fit (no rocking) of the casting.   Figure 1.77. Single-Piece Casting of an FPD.   1.68.1.2. A single-piece die (see  Figure 1.19) is very useful in achiev ing a so lid f it of  the casting. A good guideline is to cast in two pieces  and solder any FPD larger than three units. The accuracy of the casting declin es as the number of units increases. As an exam ple, a five-unit FPD can be cast as  separate two and thre e-unit segments and late r joined by s oldering. Note that the choice of materials for preparing multiple unit patterns can vary.  1.68.1.3. Wax patterns m ade by conventional t echniques with regular inlay wax work well. Patterns that are a com bination of resin and wax are equally acceptable. When the patterns for individual units have been satisfactorily positioned on a working cast, join them together with a drop of inlay wax to f orm a multiple unit pattern. Contact areas are generally egg-shaped, with the long axis of the “egg” being oriented buccolingually.  1.68.1.4. Occlusogingivally, the contact area is middle thirds of a proxim al surface. Buccolingua lly, the contact area can be found at the junction of the buccal and middle thirds of a posterior tooth’s proximal surface; except between the maxillary molars, where it is  located near the occlu sal mesial/distal developmental groove area (Figure 1.41). The m inimum width of a conn ector is 2 mm and the  minimum depth is 2.5 mm. Use extreme care when working with the wax patterns to minimize distortion. located at the junctio n of the occlusal and 1.68.2. Semiprecision (Stress Breaker) Attachment:  1.68.2.1. A  stress  breaker  is a m echanical type of connect or that depends on the dovetail retention principle to unite FPD  units (Figure 1.78). It consists  of two interlocking parts, a  key (or male) element and a keyway (or female) portion.  1.68.2.2. When used, th e stress breaker connector  usually joins the distal proxim al surface of the anterior retainer to the mesial proximal surface of the adjacent pontic. The pontic carries the key, and the retainer houses the keyway. As far as relative dimensions are concerned, a keyway should be at least twice as deep, occlusogingivally as it is wide buccolingually. The key portion of a stress b reaker connector is  not ordinarily m ade to fit the  keyway with absolute precision. Limited buccolingual movement between the connector parts is desirable.  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 1.78. Semiprecision Attachment. 101   1.68.2.3. One of the major advantages of a broken stress connector is that an FPD can be m ade for a case where the abutm ent preparations are  not parallel to each other or when an FPD includes a pier abutm ent. A seriou s disadvantage is that its use segments replacing only one tooth.  1.68.2.4. Semiprecision attachments are comm ercially available in various sizes. An  adequate stress breaker connector can be made from  materials found in  most dental facilities. The following paragraphs described two types of attachments: is restricted  to s hort sp an 1.68.2.4.1.  Commercial  Attachment  (Ney  Mini-Rest).  The Ney m ini-rest has a slightly tapered, dovetail design. To help position this attachment, a surveyor mandrel is molded as an integral part of the key portion. T he key and keyway parts are m ade of acrylic resin and are completely eliminated during burnout. Proc edures for m aking FPDs with a Ney Mini-Rest are in Figure 1.78 and as follows: 1.68.2.4.1.1. Mount the casts (Figure 1.79-A). Seat the key (m ale) portion of  the attachment in the keyway (fem ale) part  (Figure 1.79-B). Determ ine the position of  the  mini-rest by placing the m andrel (on the ke y p ortion) in a  surveyor  a nd rela ting the attachment to the dies on the working cast. Although the keyway part  of the attachm ent will probably be placed in the FPD’s anterio r retainer, the key’s path of insertion into the keyway has to line up with the lon g axis or  the distal abutm ent preparation. Mount the working cast on a surveying table and establish the attachment’s best orientation to the distal abutment die. Lock the survey table at the selected tilt (Figure 1.79-C). 1.68.2.4.1.2. Com plete the wax patterns and carve a reces s in the pattern destined  to receive the keyway. While m ounted on a surve yor, move the attachment into this recess and seal the keyway portion in position (F igure 1.79-D). Rem ove the m andrel-mounted key from the keyway and take the m andrel out of the surveyor’s spindle. The surveyor is no longer needed. 1.68.2.4.1.3. Cast the pattern that contains  the keyway portion of the attachm ent. Satin finish the casting’s exterior su rfaces and test fit it on the di e (Figure 1.79-E). Adjust the proximal contact if necessary. Be certain thworking cast (Figure 1.79-F). 1.68.2.4.1.4. Wax the pontic and distal retainer (Figure 1.79-G). Carve enough wax away from the proxim al surface of the adjacen t pon tic to accommodate th e key part of the attachment. Align the pontic on the  working cast in proper relation to the edentu lous ridge and opposing teeth. Seat the key portion  of the attachment in the keyway and join the key to the pontic pattern (F igure 1.79-H) . Cut the m andrel off the key with a hot e casting is f ully seated on the die in the 102  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 spatula (Figure 1.79-I)  and sprue the patterns. Sprue and cast the d istal retainer, pontic, and key in one piece (Figure 1.79-J).  Figure 1.79. Fabricating an FPD With a Semiprecision Attachment.  1.68.2.4.1.5. Finish, adjust, and polish the castings (Figure 1.79-K through -N). The mini-rest does not provide for un limited movement between segments of the FPD, but it does allow normal tooth movement. 1.68.2.4.2. Technician-Fabricated Key and Keyway (Figure 1.80):  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  103 1.68.2.4.2.1. Flatten off one long edge of a  wooden or plastic dent al matrix wedge and round the other two long edges slightly (Figur e 1.80-A). Use cyanoacrylate glue to attach the flattened edge of the wedge to the sm ooth side of a plastic back ing (Figure 1.80-B). Round off t he junction between the wedge and the backing by applying a minimal amount of molten inlay wax to the two lines  of union (Figure 1.80-C). Trim  the backing and the pointed end of the wedge to provide a definite seat for the key in the keyway (Figure 1.80-D).  Figure 1.80. Technician-Fabricated Key and Keyway.   1.68.2.4.2.2. Make a rubber im pression of the backing and wedge side of the assem bly. Using the sprinkle-on technique, fill the im pression with ac rylic resin to for m a plastic pattern. Many such patterns can readily be made from the same impression. Grinding can easily m odify the resu ltant ke ys if necessa ry. Use larg e p atterns for m olars and sm all patterns for premolars and anterior teeth. 1.68.2.4.2.3. Use sticky wax to m ount the plastic pattern of the key on an analyzing rod.  The long axis of the pattern should parallel the rod. Place the working cast on a surveying table and determine the best orientation of the  dies to the key as previously described for the Ney mini-rest. Lock the table at the selected tilt. 104  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 1.68.2.4.2.4. Now that all patterns are com pleted, cut a rec ess in to the  re tainer p attern destined to contain the keyway. The reces s should be large enough to accomm odate the plastic pattern of the key. 1.68.2.4.2.5. Lubricate the key. Place the wo rking cas t on the surv eying tab le and position the key in the retainer pattern’s recess. Flow melted inlay wax over the resin key and incorporate it into the contour of the retainer. Complete the key from the wax. Invest, cast, and finish the retainer, taking particular care to preserve the accuracy of the keyway. 1.68.2.4.2.6. Position the finished retainer on the die and replace the  plastic pattern in the keyway. Make wax patterns for a one-piece ca sting of the p osterior retainer and pontic, incorporating the key pattern into the pontic pattern. Sprue, invest, and complete the one-piece casting. 1.68.2.4.2.7. Finish, adjust, veneer, and polish the FPD. 1.68.3.  Solder  Connectors. A two-piece castin g can also be  used to construct an  FPD. W hen using a solder connector, first co mpletely wax the retainers and pon tic in one piece as previously described in paragraphs 1.63 and 1.65. Cut through  the connector area to be soldered, using a wax saw or suture silk. The pontic shou ld remain attached to the  smaller retainer. The wax-up is no w ready to b e com pleted and cast.  After castin g,  the FPD can be so ldered. Procedures for the soldering process are detailed in paragraph 1.75. 1.69. Completing the Wax-Up. Figure 1.81 and the following procedures apply to this process:  Figure 1.81. Refine the Margins and Smooth the Wax Patterns.   1.69.1. Refine the margins. When carving the junc tion between the wax and the stone die back to where the preparation b egins, use b lunt carvers instead of sharp instrum ents. Blunt carve rs will produce a clean, well-defined margin without marring the die’s surface. NOTE: If the wax pattern margins are grossly distorted, re move the pattern and ca refully cut it b ack 2 m m off the m argin. Apply a fresh coat of die lubricate to  the die and reseat the pattern. Quickly flow molten wax into the space created to cover the margin and provide a smooth internal adaptation. 1.69.2. Sm ooth and polish the paclusal su rface irregularities.

Spruing:  105 1.70.1. Attach a 10-gauge wax sprue former (pattern sprue) to each unit as if it were an individual pattern (Figure 1.82). Reduce the sprue for mers  to a unifor m height of 4 to 6 mm from the patterns. Place an 8-gauge wax rod (runner bDepending on the num ber of units be ing cas t, attach two or thre e 8- to 10-gauge wax sprue formers (lead sprues) opposite the pattern sprue formers on the runner bar.  ar)  over them and seal them  with m olten wax.   Figure 1.82. Spruing an FPD.   1.70.2. The lead and pattern sprue form ers should be on the same plane, but not in direct line with one another. Cut off  the lead sprue f ormers to  a length tha t will position  the patte rns outside the  thermal zone. Normally, this position places the pattern 6 mm from the end of the casting ring. Be sure to leave at least 6 mm of investment covering the pattern for strength.  1.70.3. Remove the sprued wax pattern from  the working cast by carefully withdrawing it parallel to the long axes of the dies. Att ach the lead sprue for mers to the sprue base at a common point of attachment. Use the wax orientatio n dot m ethod to  record the position  of the patte rn in the r ing (paragraph 1.52.4.5). Indirect spruing is described in detail in paragraph 1.52.4.3. 1.71. Investing. Invest the pattern according to an acceptab le method of choice. (See Figure 1.57 and paragraph 1.54.4.) 1.72. Burnout. Follow burnout procedures described in paragraph 1.55. 1.73. Casting. Use the reference dot on the investment’s crucible surface to precisely position the ring in the casting m achine. If a horizontal casting m achine is  used, orien t the pattern  vertic ally with the pattern’s thin areas trailing while the m achine is  spinning. For additiona l guidance on casting see paragraph 1.56. 1.74. Finishing the FPD. Finishing an FPD is essentially the same as finishing a single unit (Figure 1.65). Additional care must be taken not to reduce th e size of the connectors. A detailed description of the finishing process is given in paragraph 1.58. 1.75.  Soldering. Soldering consis ts of applying heat to pieces of m etal that are next to each other,flowing a lower fusing  m etal (so lder) on to the su rfaces of the ad joining p ieces, and filling the intervening space at the same time. After the solder cools, the metal pieces are rigidly connected.   1.75.1. Requirements of a Solder Connector: 106  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 1.75.1.1. A solder joint has to  be free of oxide and voids for  maximum strength. Dental gold alloys contain base m etals, particularly copper, that readily oxidize in the presence of oxygen. Satisfactory union between units will not take p lace unless the surfaces to be soldered are free from debris and oxide. Besides m echanical cleaning of the parts to be  joined, a good soldering flux is essential. 1.75.1.2. The physiologic and m echanical success of the soldered connection also depends on lder joint must be centered on the proxim al the design or shape of the connection. The socontact area, triangular in shape with rounded corners, and have concave peripheral borders (Figure 1.83). The gingivo-occlus al or incisal length of the conn ection is critical. The soldered area must not encroach on the interdental tissue  or allow a food pocket to  be created (Figure 1.84). The joint has to be wide enough, facioli ngually, for strength, but not  so wide as to be visible and unsightly (Figure 1.83). 1.75.1.3. A solder joint has to unite the units of an FPD or splint precisely.  Figure 1.83. Solder Joint Between Two Posterior Castings (Proximal View).  Figure 1.84. Solder Joint Between Two Posterior Castings (Buccal View).    1.75.2.  Procedures  Associated  With  Soldering  Type  III  Golds:  (NOTE:  Procedures for soldering porcelain fused to metal systems are in Chapter 2 of this volume.) 1.75.2.1. Aligning the Units on the Working Cast and Evaluating the Width of the Solder Gaps (Figure 1.85): 1.75.2.1.1. Remove all oxide from  the proximal surfaces to be joined with a rubber wheel. Do not polish the surfaces. The solder bond is stronger on a satin finish. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 1.85. Testing the Width of the Solder Gap. 107  1.75.2.1.2. Place the retainers and pontics on the cast. Seat the retainers on the dies as solidly as possible. 1.75.2.1.3. When assembling the FPD or fixed splint on the cast before soldering, the proper width of the solder gap between units is a very  important consideration. Factors tha t affect the width of the solder gap are the setting expansion of the soldering investment, the thermal expansion of the investment, and the thermal expansion of the metal units.  1.75.2.1.4. The setting and therm al expansions of the soldering investment tend to increase the solder gap over what has been established on the cast. On the other hand, thermal expansions of the gold parts tend  to close the gap. When the investment and metal units are heated, the overall effect is to close the solder  gap. The width of the so lder gap at its closest point should be about 0.15 to 0.30 mm (0.005 to  0.010 inch). This distance, represented by two to three thicknesses of letter paper, m ay be judged by slipping  letter paper through the gap while the units are assembled on the cast.  1.75.2.1.5. If the gap is too sm all, metal-to-metal contact of the units  might occur during heating. Such contact could cause shifting of the units, warping of  the m etal, and possibly  cracking of the investment. On the other hand, if the gap is too wide, the solder joint will be porous and the likelihood for distortion will be greater. 1.75.2.2. Relating Units to Each Other and Investing the Assembly. Units can be  related to each other for soldering in either of two ways, t he stone index method or the resin m ethod, as follows: 1.75.2.2.1. Stone Index Method (Figure 1.86). The purpose of a stone index is to hold the castings in position while the solder investment is being poured: 1.75.2.2.1.1. First, paint a separatin g medium for dental stone onto the surfaces of the teeth adjacent to the fixed prosthesis. To form an index for a posterior FPD or splint, fill a segment of a used m etal denture tooth card with low-expan sion stone and place it over the occlusal surfaces of the castings (Figure  1.86-A). Include about half a stone tooth on  each side o f the prosth esis. The section of  denture too th card acts as  a tray. Make a soldering index for an anterior FPD or splin t on the lingual aspect  of the arch. Cut and bend the denture tooth card to conform to the curvature or make a carrier out of baseplate wax.   108  Figure 1.86. Stone Index Method of Fabricating a Solder Investment Patty. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005   e  into the wa x. This prevents solder investm ent from  1.75.2.2.1.2. After the stone has set, remove the index. The index should include the cusp tips of posterior castin gs or the entire lingua l surfaces of anterio rs. Anything more is  unnecessary and should be trim med away. Trim the index to 3 mm (1/8 inch) around the perimeter of the castings (Figure 1.86-B). 1.75.2.2.1.3. Remove the retainer castings from their dies.  Reposition the castings in the index. Lute the c astings in pos ition by apply ing sticky wax (Figure  1.86-C). Do not use sticky wax in the join t areas because the wax contraction during cooling might make the castings move out of position. 1.75.2.2.1.4. Fill the e mbrasures in the joint areas with inlay wax. Carve the precisshapes of the solder connectorsentering the solder joint gap (Figure 1.86-D). 1.75.2.2.1.5. Paint the exposed stone surfaces of the index with a separating medium. 1.75.2.2.1.6. Wrap a 15 to 20 mm wi de strip of boxing wax around the index to form  the solder investment patty (Figure 1.86-E). 1.75.2.2.1.7. Mix the solder investm ent according to the m anufacturer’s instructions and paint it onto and around the castings with a soft brush. Fill the boxed index  with investment material. 1.75.2.2.1.8. W hen the investm ent has set,  separate the a ssembly f rom the inde x by immersing the assembly in boiling water, melting the sticky wax. Trim the investment to 15 to 20 mm thick and 3 mm (1/8 inch) around the perimeter. 1.75.2.2.1.9. Thoroughly flush away all wax re sidues from the investm ent with boiling water. Cut V-shaped channels leading from the edge of the investment to the metal parts to be soldered (Figure 1.86-F). These cha nnels give the s oldering flam e access to the joint. Ensure no loose investment particles remain in the spaces between the units. 1.75.2.2.1.10. While the assembly is still wa rm from boiling, use an ex plorer dipped in flux to place a s mall am ount of soldering  (CAUTION:  An excess of flux will caus e pits and weaken  solder joints.) The f low of solder has to be controlled. It cannot be allowed to ruin m argins or run onto carved flux onto the m etal areas to be joined.AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  109 occlusal surfaces. Areas on which solder is not  wanted may be covered with an antiflux, applied after the soldering flux application. A good antiflux is m ade by moistening rouge with chloroform and painting it on the areas where solder is not desired. Use a small, soft brush to sparingly apply this mixture. 1.75.2.2.2. Resin Method (Figure 1.87). Use a high-quality, fast-set ting material such as Dura Lay ® or Zap-It® to unite the castings. Ensure the  castings are seated properly on the stone dies. Apply resin, using th e brush-on technique or tube t ype dispenser into the solder joint area. Continue to do th is until the resin has enough stre ngth to allow handling of the prosthesis during subsequent steps. Once the re sin has set and the prosthesis rem oved from the cast, check the tissue side of the joint for voids. If voids are present, add more resin. (Let the resin polymerize while the prosthesis is seated on the working cast.)  Figure 1.87. Resin Method.  tings. Float the prosthes1.75.2.2.2.1. Place p roperly measured and m ixed investment on a su itable work su rface and build up to a h eight of 25 m m (1 inch ). Use small increments of investments to fill the inside of individual casis o n the m ound of investm ent material. Stand the ass embly upright and tak e care not to b ury it. Le ave as m uch metal exposed as possible, but be sure that the m argins are covered. Maintain a sufficient bulk of investment beneath the castings (15 to 20 mm) to provide strength during the soldering operation.  1.75.2.2.2.2. After the investment has set, trim it to these following dimensions: 15 to 20 mm thick a nd 3 mm be yond the perim eter of the castings. Cut a V-shaped groove from the edge of the investment to the joint areas . Paint around the periphery  of all joints with antiflux if desirable (paragraph 1.75.2.2.1.10). 1.75.2.2.2.3. It is not necessary to go thr ough the boilout procedure  associated with the stone index method. All of th e resin will vaporize during th e preheating operation in the burnout oven. 1.75.2.3. Secondary Laboratory Solder Relationship Index (Figure 1.88). If a resin index has come directly form the patient’s mouth, it is a good idea to fabricate a secondary laboratory index to check the prosthesis for accuracy after soldering has been completed as follows:   110  Figure 1.88. Secondary Laboratory Solder Relationship Index. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005   1.75.2.3.1. First, place the stone dies from  the working cas t into the castings and use sticky  wax to hold them in place (Figure 1.88-A). 1.75.2.3.2. If pindex pins were used, slide ne w sleeves over the d ie pins. Mix the sto ne and place a mound on the bench thicker than the leng th of the lon ger die pins. Gently place the dies with castings into the stone until the pins are fully covered. Do not bury the dies into the stone. 1.75.2.3.3. After the stone has set trim the stone patty leaving a 3 to 5 mm border around the perimeter of the dies (Figure 1.88-B). 1.75.2.3.4. Re move the castings and com plete  the soldering procedures. After soldering, return the FPD to the dies on the stone index and check for accuracy. 1.75.2.4. Selecting a Solder and Cutting the Strip Into Pieces. Select s older with a  melting range at least 100 oF below the melting range of the castings. The solder’s color must match the castings. There are two ways of getting solder to a joint area during the soldering procedure: 1.75.2.4.1. Feed the strip of solder into a ch erry-red embrasure until a joint of satisfactory size develops. 1.75.2.4.2. Place a p iece of solder of suitable s ize in the embras ure before the so ldering. In the strip feed m ethod, solder flow is fast and  heavy and its spread is som etimes difficult to control even with antiflux. Solder may run onto delicate margins or onto occlusal surfaces to destroy carefully established  occlusal relations hips. The size and shap e of the joint can  better be controled when the solder has been cut into pieces and pl aced with appropria te forceps. 1.75.2.5. Preheating the Assembly. Place the invested castings in a burnout furnace. Heat soak the assem bly at 900  oF for 30 m inutes. Do not preheat the assem bly over a bunsen burner e inv estment clo sest to the fl ame expands m ore rapidly than flame. Because the part of thportions further rem oved, this causes distorted assem bly relation ships and  occasion al investment cracking. 1.75.2.6. Soldering:  1.75.2.6.1. Adjust the torch flam e so the reducing part of the flam e is large enough to cover AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  111 rger. The reducing atmosphere prevents the connector area being soldered, but no latroublesome oxide formation. A larger flam e only increases the chances of releasing sulfur contaminants from the surrounding investment. 1.75.2.6.2. Re move the preheated assem bly from  the burnout oven and place it on a hot soldering frame. If not previously done, place a small amount of flux in the joint area. Coat a small square of solder with flux and place it in the linguo-occlusal embrasure of the joint area (Figure 1.89). 1.75.2.6.3. Using the reducing part of the flam e, gradually heat up the units adjacent to the joint area. Avoid applying the heat of the torch directly to  the solder. W hen the castings  become dull red in co lor, they are ap proaching soldering temperature. Switch from gradual heating of a relatively large flam e’s m ovement around the connector site. The units will become bright red, and the solder should  flow. As soon as th e solder flows, remove the flame. e area to concentrating th1.75.2.7.  Bench  Cooling  and  Removing  the  Investment. Allow the s oldered ass embly to bench cool com pletely. Rapid quenching from  a high temperature induces distortion. Slow cooling heat hardens the restora tion. Cleanse the  soldered castings of investment particles and pickle them to remove oxides. 1.75.2.8. Finishing. Proper control of the am ount of so lder used to m ake the connection will  minimize the effort needed to finish  the soldered area. Use a separating  disc or a sm all tapered fissure bur (#669 or #700) to develop the final sh ape of the joint. A knife-edged rubber wheel will further smooth the area. Use guidelines f or finishing in paragraph 1.58 for completion and polishing.  Figure 1.89. Soldering an FPD.  112  1.76. Repairing Metal Castings: AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 1.76.1.

Pick up the cro wn with a p air of locking tweezers, hemostats, or cotton pliers. Make sure you don’t accidentally dam age the margin. NOTE: To make a pair of soldering  tweezers, bend one tip of a pair of locking tweezers. Place the bent tip on the inside of the crown to avoid crimping the margin. 1.76.1.3. Select the so lder and cut a piece larg er than actually needed. (The added bulk will help in recontouring the proximal surface.) 1.76.1.4.

Larger voids that extend all the way through a casting m ust first be invest ed. Also, a backing of  platinum foil is used underneath the hole to aid in solder flow. Ho les on the o cclusal surf ace can be successfully repaired, but you risk covering the entire surface with solder. Do not try to repair deficient margins because it is improbable that adding solder will result in an acceptable margin.  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  1.76.2.1. Start by adapting a s mall piece of platinum foil onto the die an d in the area under the hole. Seat the casting on the di e and sticky wax the foil to th e casting through the hole (Figure 1.91-A). Remove the casting and check to see that the foil stays in place inside the casting. Fill  the casting with solder investment and set it down in a small investment patty.  Figure 1.91.

Overview:   the occlusion of a fixed prosthesis in an 1.77.1. Most tim es, the technician’s adjusting ofarticulator b efore try- in and the dentist’s refining of the occlusion in the patient’s m outh are enough to ensure the prosthesis will function satisf actorily. However, the tr uth of this statem ent decreases as the number of units being placed in the patient’s mouth at one time increases.  1.77.2. In a situation where a com plete mouth rehabilitation is being done and m any units have  been made for both arches, most dentists will order a remount of all castings in the articulator after try-in. To do this, the dentist must try the castings in the patient’s mouth and make sure they fit the preparations, perform gross occlusal adjustm ents on the castings, seat all of the castings on the preparations and m ake m axillary and m andibular pickup  im pressions; m ake a new facebow transfer, and m ake a new jaw relationship reimpressions, castings, a facebow transfer, and a jaw relationship record, pour the impressions and remount the castings.  cord.

The pickup  impression usually consists of a com bination acrylic resin and zinc oxide-eugenol matrix embedded in an alginate impression. Paint the interior of the casting with a white, liquid shoe polish and let the film dry. Position the ca stings in the  impression, seating each  casting firm ly and positiv ely in the m atrix. Protect the m argins of the  castings by flowing a thin layer of rubber base impression material onto them. 1.78.2. Pour the pickup im pression. Melt the low-fu sing metal of choice as suggested in Volume 1, Chapter 2. Syringe the melted metal into the castings. Add enough additional metal to create an arch f orm at least 6 m m thick. After the  m etal  cools, in corporate s ome for m of  mechanical retention into its base. For exam ple, heat paper clip loops or small brass screws and partially embed them in a number of places. Pour the rest of the impression in dental stone. Be sure to form a few retention nodules on the base of the stone. 1.78.3. Use the facebow transfer to mount the maxillary cast (paragraph 1.29.2). 1.78.4. Use the interocclusal jaw relationship record to mount the lower cast (paragraph 1.30.2). 1.78.5. Adjust the occlusion (paragraph 1.58.6). 1.78.6. Final polish as directed by the dentist. In complete mouth rehabilitation ca ses, this will probably mean applying a mandrel-mounted wire brush to the occlusal surfaces of posterior teeth and high shining the lingual surfaces and incisal edges of anterior teeth with jeweler’s rouge.  Section 1N—Post and Core Castings 1.79.  Construction  Procedures. Most teeth that have been endodontically treated  have been so destroyed by caries or previ ous restorations that there is very litt le clinical crown left. Often, only the root portion is lef t to re tain the crown. A casting, calle d a post and cor e, must then be constru cted for retention. This dev ice anchors in the root and re places th e suprag ingival axial w alls sim ilar to the standard crown preparation. Post and core castings are most often associated with endodontically treated anterior teeth, but they m ay be used on posterior teeth as well (F igure 1.92). Patterns for post and core construction can be m ade of wax,  self-curing acrylic, o r m etal and a crylic, us ing eith er the  dire ct technique or indirect technique.   Figure 1.92. Post and Core Castings for Anterior and Posterior Teeth.   AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  115 1.79.1. Waxing. Using the indirect technique, patterns are  more easily made of  wax. A device is needed to strengthen the wax post portion of the pattern and to ensur e wax com pletely fills the root canal. A sprue between the tip  of the post and the gutta-percha  used to fill the root tip would not be acceptable.  To p revent this from happening, use a 1 4-gauge solid plastic sprue form er or paper clip inside the canal (Figure 1.93). 1.79.1.1. Trim the tip of the plastic sprue form er so it will e xactly fit in to the canal and reach the apical end of the preparation. Also, cut small notches into the sprue to aid in retention of the wax. 1.79.1.2. Liberally apply die sepa rator to the in side of the prep aration. Using an explorer or PKT No. 2, f ill the apical end of the canal with  dead soft wax (sprue wax, utility wax). W arm the spru e s lightly and insert it into  the wa x completely (Figure 1.93-A ). W ait until the wax cools and test the wax post for removal. Be sure each time the pattern is removed it is returned to the same place. Rewax the pattern if it has voids or if it breaks. 1.79.1.3. Add enough inlay wax to the coronal portion of the pattern to  overbuild the core. Carve away the excess wax and refine the core  pattern until it imitates the contours of an ideal crown preparation (Figure 1.93-B). Ensure the m argin of the core is continuous with the canal preparation. NOTE: The final restoration will probably be a metal-ceramic crown. See Chapter 2 of this volume for details on amount of reduction needed for a metal-ceramic crown.  Figure 1.93. Post and Core Construction.   1.79.2. Spruing. Sprue the pattern on the incisal or occlusal surface (Figure 1.93-C). 1.79.3. Investing. Add 1 or 2 cc more water per package of investment to lessen the am ount of mold expansion and thereby produce a sm aller post and core that will h ave less tendency to bind in the canal. 1.79.4. Burnout and Casting. Follow the conventional routine used with Type III gold alloys. 1.79.5.  Finishing. Finish the casting as you would an inlay. Check the casting’s fit by gently seating it in the preparati on. If it binds in the canal or will no t seat completely, coat the post with disclosing medium and relieve any shiny spots  on the casting that are disclosed by the m edium. Once the casting com pletely seats in the prepara tion, desprue the post and core. Recontour the sprue attachment area and finish the casting with mounted stones or sandpaper discs. Give the core part of the casting a final satin finish with a rubber wheel. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 116   AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Chapter 2 117 METAL-CERAMIC RESTORATIONS   Section 2A—Metal-Ceramic System 2.1. Overview. The inform ation presented in this section  applies to the noble-m etal alloy system s and does not necessarily reflect the characteristics of base metal alloy systems. A metal-ceramic restoration is one in which veneer porcelain is bonded to an unde rlying metal substructure. This type of restoration enables the dentist to provide the patient the esthetic and biological advantages of porcelain plus the fit, strength, and durability of  a ceramic alloy. Also, porcelain is i mpervious to m outh fluids, color stable, resistant to abrasion, and causes minimal tissue reaction. 2.2. Physical Characteristics of the Metal-Ceramic System: 2.2.1. Strength of the Bond. The role of each bonding mechanism between porcelain and metal is not clearly defined. Three factors influence the bonding of porcelain to metal: 2.2.1.1. A  chemical bond occurs when oxides, prim arily tin oxide, on the m etal surface fuse with the porcelain during firing.  2.2.1.2. A  compression  bond  exists when the  cooling m etal sh rinks, drawing th e porce lain together and placing the veneer  in a state of compression. The  metal substructure should be designed to take full advantage of the compressive nature of porcelain.  2.2.1.3. A mechanical bond results from the gripping action of  the porcelain that has solidified in the microscopic grooves and undercuts of th e metal surface. The bond  strength of porcelain fused to m etal is gr eater than the  tensile strength of the porcelain itse lf. A break would occur through the porcelain before the porcelain and metal pull apart. 2.2.2. Coefficients of Thermal Expansion:  2.2.2.1. The success of using one manufacturer’s porcelain system with another’s ceramic alloy may be m easured in term s of their coefficients  of ther mal expansion. The coeffi cients of thermal expansion of the porcelain and the m etal must be relatively c lose if the porcelain is to remain firmly bonded after the completed restoration has cooled.  2.2.2.2. Although the expansion coefficients of the porcelain and metal are similar, they are not the same. Porcelain is strongest  when it is com pressed. Manufacturers deliberately lower the coefficient of expansion of the porcelain s lightly in re lation  to the  m etal. (The porce lain expands, or sim ilarly shrinks, less than the m etal.) After firing and su bsequent cooling, the porcelain is bonded to the m etal in a state of compre ssion. If the opposite  condition exists, the porcelain, after cooling, would be  in a state of tension  and the veneer would  likely crack. It is for this reason that the porcelain and alloy chosen should be a compatible system. 2.2.3.  Strength  of  the  Substructure. W hen a porcelain veneer is bonded to metal, any deformation of the m etal may cause the br ittle porcelain to fracture. Metal frameworks must be strong enough to resist any defor mation under an  occlusal load. An alloy’s strength does not depend solely on how its molecules are put together. Strength also depends on the bulk and design of the metal frame. As the length of  the span increases, an FPD must have a thicker cross-s ection and the thickness increase must be in line with o cclusal loading. In designing posterior FPDs with veneered pontics, one reason for covering the occlusal and tissue contacting surfaces with metal is that the correspondingly greater bulk of metal will increase resistance to deformation and decrease the possibility of porcelain fracture. 118  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.2.4.  Melting  Range  of  Ceramic  Alloys. Most low-fusing porcelai ns m ature between 870 to 1065 oC. Because the melting range of the conventiona l golds used in dentistry is approxim ately the same temperature, it is necessary to have an alloy with a higher melting range to withstand the firing temperature of dental porcelain without de forming. Several ceram ic alloys are form ulated with a casting range from 1150 to 1360  oC. The technician can bond low-fusing porcelain to these ceramic alloys without any deformation of the framework. 2.2.5. Thickness of the Veneer:  2.2.5.1. The combined thickness of m etal and porcelain on the facial surface of m etal-ceramic crowns should be at least 1.2 to 1.5 mm t requirements (Figure 2.1). There should be atveneer areas to keep the substructure fromfracturing the applied porcelain. The opaque laye r needs to be 0.1 to 0.2 mm  thick to perform its masking function. The dentin and enam el porcelain should be a m inimum of 0.8 mm thick with 1 mm being ideal to reproduce the desired shade. More porcelain may be needed in the incisal portion because of added translucency necessary in this area.  hick to m eet m inimum strength and shade least 0.3 mm m etal thickness in the porcelain-  flexing during seating or occlusal load, thus  Figure 2.1. Veneer and Metal Thickness.   the required m etal and porcel ain thickness on a stone die 2.2.5.2. The technician can place regardless of the amount of tooth reduction done by the dentist. However, if the tooth’s  normal contour is to be restored, the dentist is obligated to reduce the facial surface of the tooth at least 1.2 mm to ensure there is room for the minimal thickness of metal and porcelain.  2.2.5.3. Pontics should be made so the bulk of the pontic is composed of metal evenly veneered with 1 to 1.5 mm of por celain. Metal-ceramic frameworks should be made so porcelain can be uniformly applied in a thickness th at does not  exceed 1.5 mm on the fa cial or 2 mm on the  incisal. Try to keep the porcelain to a m inimum thickness without sacr ificing esthetics. A  thin, uniform thickness of porcelain supported by a rigid substructure offers the most strength. 2.2.5.4. The relative thickness of the m etal substructure, opaque, dentin and enam el porcelains depend on the type of ceramic alloy and porcelain used. For example, metal substructures made from high-gold content alloys need to be at least 0.5 mm thick to adequately support the AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  119 porcelain. The minimum thicknesses listed above are not absolute and will not app ly in eve ry given situation. Strength requirements also depend on the design and extent of the restoration. Section 2B—Color and Shade Selection 2.3. Color. Visible ligh t is th e range of the electrom agnetic spectrum that is visible to the  human eye. The visible light range includes vi olet, blue, green, yellow, orange,  and red wavelengths (spectrum s). Color is def ined as the physical  modifications of light by colorant s, observed by the hum an eye and interpreted by the brain. Th e m any variables involved in produci ng color will be discussed in this section. 2.3.1. Dimensions of Color: 2.3.1.1. Just as an object can be described by its  dimensions (length, width, and depth), color  can be described by its dimensions (hue, chroma, and value).  2.3.1.2.  Hue denotes the nam e or type of color. Fo r exam ple, red, orange, and blue are all names for colors.  2.3.1.3. Chroma is the amount of sa turation of a hue. For  example, an object that is intensely red is higher in chroma than pale pink.  2.3.1.4. Value, sometimes referred to as brightness or reflectivity, can be defined as the relative whiteness or blackness  of a hue. High value is m ore white  or reflective. When relating to a  black and white photograph to describing value, a light  blue object next to  a tan colored object may appear as identical levels of gray. Value is probably the most important dimension of color to the dentist and technician. If the value of a  restoration and the teeth match, small differences in the hue a nd chroma will not usu ally be noti ced, but a c rown of higher value w ill be m ore reflective and readily visible. 2.3.2.  Subtractive  Color  System. This system is used with pigm ented objects and is useful in  characterizing fixed prosthodontic restorations. When light reflects from a pigmented object, some wavelengths are absorbed or  subtracted. The color you see is the wavelength reflected from the object. The red from  a stop sign subtracts all wa velengths except red. The three primary hues are red, yellow, and blue. They are the basis of the subtractiv e color system and cannot be reproduced by m ixing other hues. As their nam es i mply, s econdary hues are produced by m ixing prim ary hues. They are orange, green, and violet.  2.3.3. Complementary Colors: llow and violet are the two most common the color wheel (Figure 2.2) is called a 2.3.3.1. Any hue that is opposite another hue on complementary hue. Orange and blue and yecomplementary color relationships used in reference to fixed restorations.  2.3.3.2. Adjusting the shade is rarely as sim ple as adding a hue that is lacking. More often it also involves reducing an apparent excess of chroma in a given hue or making an adjustment in value as well. Complementary hues become an important part of this process.  2.3.3.3. When two complem entary hues of equal ch roma are m ixed together, they produce a neutral gray. This can be a very effective way to reduce chroma or lower value.  intensify the chroma  of the dom inant hue 2.3.3.4. Complem entary hues can also be used to present. When two complem entary hues are placed  side by  side, each intens ifies the other’s chroma. For instance, placing blue stain along th e cervical, m esial, and  distal boundaries of a predominantly yellow tooth may make the tooth appear more yellow.  120  Figure 2.2. Color Wheel. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005   2.3.4. Color Variables. Many factors come into play when observing, recording, and reproducing a selected tooth shade. Be aware of the followi ng environmental influences when evaluating the color of a tooth: 2.3.4.1. Object Variables. When looking at an object su ch as a crown, the colo r of the object may contrast with the surroundings. A green object placed on a yellow background will appear blue. The same green object placed on a blue background will appear yellow. Because blue and yellow together produce green, placement of a green object on  one of these colors contrasts the remaining color. This same effect can also be  applied to the value of  an object. For example, a gray object on a black b ackground will appear lighter; on a white background, the sam e object would appear darker. 2.3.4.2. Light Source Variables. Without light, color cannot exist. Each light source, whether it is d aylight, f luorescent ligh t, or c olor-corrected ligh t, emits wavelen gths of  vary ing color,  temperature, and intensity. Cool white fluores cent or norm al office fluorescent bulbs usually emit light high in blue and gree n. Incandescent bulbs are high in  yellow and red. Daylight is considered by many to be the best light source fo r comparing colors. However, daylight varies in intensity and quality depending on atm ospheric conditions and tim e of day. The light that produces consistent illum ination a nd negates using daylight is the  color-corrected  light or a commercially available, hand-he ld light for taking shades. Th ese lights  are m ade to em it a broader spectrum of light for better color comparisons. 2.3.4.3.  Metamerism. This phenom enon occu rs when s timuli reaching the eye causes two objects to m atch in color  under  certain  lighting  conditions. To avoid m etamerism, com pare objects in the same or similar light sources and build color modifications internally. 2.3.4.4. Cone Fatigue. Avoid staring at the teeth or a shade guide for long periods of tim e. After staring at a particular co lor, the retinal  cones in your eyes becom e desensitized to th at color. If yo u stare at a blue  card, blue will d eplete the retinal chemical balance for blue, and AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  121 orange will be easily seen. An  opposite reactio n will occu r if  you stared at a yellow-orange card. Varying your gaze and looking  at a variety  of colors is less likely  to desensitize any one color. Do not use the blue card as a background for comparing shades. White is the best background for extraoral comparisons. 2.4. Selecting a Shade. As a m inimum, the dentist will s elect the shade for the restoration and includ e this information on the prescr iption form. The techni cian will then inter pret the prescription and make the restoration, duplicating  the shade selected. Shade  selection is a dentist’s  responsibility; but, when possible, the individual who will make the restoration should be involved in the shade selection process. Whether selecting a shade or comparing the restoration to a shade tab, the following principles apply:  2.4.1. Take the shade in a neutrally colored room , the porcelain room, or a room with some outside light available. If possible, u se a co lor-corrected light as the prim ary light source. Cover  bright or high chrom a clothing  with a patient napkin and have  lipstick removed. Choose a shade guide com patible to your porce lain system  and if possible arrange guides by value. Choose a shade with a sim ilar value rega rdless of shade. C hoosing value is difficult for many people, reducing the amount of light entering the eye by squinting can help discern reflectivity.  2.4.2. Once satisfied that the value is correct, try to determ ine the dom inant hue of the tooth. Natural teeth have dom inant hues in the y ellow to yellow-orange  range. With the Vita  Lumin® shade guide, the A range is yellow-red, the B range is predominately yellow, the C range is a gray-yellow, and the D range is gray yellow-red in co lor. Other shade guide system s may have varying hues and organization. If choosing the hue is difficult, compare areas thin in enamel such as the lingual, proximal, or cervical regions of a tooth.  2.4.3. For the last comparison, determ ine the chrom a. The selected chrom a level should closely correspond to the previous value se lection. For exam ple, a value se lection of D3 with a hue and chroma selection of A3 is alm ost ideal. These  two shade tabs are ad jacent to e ach other on the value scale. Use of either shade would probably work fine, so choose the closest match. 2.4.4. If no satisfactory shade m atch is available,  select a shade tab that is higher in value and lower in chrom a. A higher value shade can be lowetranslucency. Any deviation in the darker crown will be less noticeable over a lighter crown. 2.4.5. The shade selection process improves with pr actice. Develop a habit  of viewing the shade selection at various distances—close up and thenabnormalities, be sure to  include these on the pres cription along with an y characteristics such as  glaze level and surface texture. red (adjusted) m ore ea sily without loss of final  restoration  should be toward a lower valu e because a  far away. If there are any color defects or  Section 2C—Substructure Design and Fabrication 2.5. Factors in Substructure Design. To a grea t extent, the shape of  the m etal substructure seriously affects the stresses that develop in the porcelain. As it is being fired, porcelain tries to becom e a sphere. This results in the porcelain drawin g to the m etal structure; and when the re storation has cooled, the porcelain is in a com pressive state. If the metal’s surface is sharp or uneven, tensile stresses are created in the porcelain as it cools and may cause the veneer to fail. 2.5.1. Surface Form. The prim ary bond between porcelain and m etal is chem ical in nature, but mechanical bonding also plays an im portant role. Bond strength overall seem s best when the  porcelain-bearing metal surfaces are gently  rounded. Avoid producing corners,  angles, poin ts, or deep concavities on the porcelain-bearing surfaces. Sharp angles and points will cre ate stresses in the porcelain, causing it to fracture. Deep concavities are a problem because the porcelain is likely 122  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 to shrink away from these areas during firing towards its greatest bulk. Due to the tenacious bond strength between porcelain  and m etal, m echanical retention in the fperipheral boxing (acrylic resin ve neer) is not required and, if pr esent, would make the porcelain more susceptible to fracture. orm of beads, lugs, or 2.5.1.1. Tooth Preparation. A typical tooth preparation for an terior restorations combines a facial shoulder m argin style with a lingual ch amfer or knife-edge m argin (Figure 2.3). The amount of tooth surface removed from the facial surface is about 1.5 to 2.0 mm, and only about half this thickness is removed from the lingual portion. An elevated ridge, called a wing, results from the differences in these depths and is us ually located lingual to the proximal contact area. This preparation form significantly affects the design of the preparation.  Figure 2.3. Typical Tooth Preparation for Anterior Metal-Ceramic Restorations.   (and only then) can you be2.5.1.2. Full Contour Wax-Up. The porcelain-bearing surfaces of substructures should closely parallel the finished contours of  the porcelain v eneers. Remember, porcelain is strongest when it is applied  in a thin unif orm thickness. To do this, wax the restor ations to f ull contour and uniformly cut back the wax patterns. Then  sure of a uniform thickness of porcelain and know where to place the metal-ceramic junction (commonly referred to as porcelain-to-metal junction or finish line) . If the porcelain is left unsupported, two results will likely happen—the  porcelain m ay f racture due  to s tress or th ermal shock or subsurf ace porosity may increase in the thicker sections, weakening the porcelain. 2.5.1.3. Finish Lines. When wax patterns are m ade, finish lines should be placed in a position  to take full advantage of the compressive strength (paragraph 2.2) of the porcelain. Designs that do not let th e porcelain wrap around  the structure are not recomm ended because the porcelain does not have anything to grasp  or hold on to. W ith this design, the risk of fracture is m uch greater than when the fin ish line is k ept as low as possible (Figure 2.4 ). All junctions between porcelain and metal on the external  surface of a restoration should  be as close to  a 90-degree angle as possible (Figure 2.5). Th e porcelain must not be feathe red at the porcelain-to-m etal junction because the porcelain would be m ore likely to chip in function or “flake off” during seating. 2.5.1.4. Cervical Collar. A cervical collar of metal is recommended for strength and support of the porcelain in the shoulder area. W ith beveled  shoulder preparations, the width of the facial bevel determines the width of the cervical co llar. A 1 mm wide bevel  requires a  1 mm wide cervical collar. At a minimum, provide a 0.5 mm cervical collar as a routine practice. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 2.4. Balancing the Compressive Strength of Porcelain. 123  Figure 2.5. Creating a 90-Degree Angle Butt Joint for Porcelain.    2.5.1.5. Porcelain Margins. Sometimes, the placem ent of faci al metal margins subgingivally creates problems. If the patient has thin translucent tissue, a dark shadow m ay be visible at the gum line. This dark shadow reflected at the cer vical collar is considered unattractive. One way to prevent this problem is to m ake crowns w ithout metal collars (colla rless) (Figure 2.6). The dentist cuts a shoulder preparati on for the porcelain m argin technique. An altern ative to this design requires the metal and porcelain to be finished to a knife edge at the margin (known as a disappearing margin). However, this  design is  not recommended because the porcelain could  fracture while the crow n is being seated. Do  not try to apply porcelain over a long beveled shoulder that was originally prepared for a cervical collar. 2.5.2. Occlusal Contacts. As a rule, never place the metal-ceramic junction at an MI contact point or area because porcelain fracture would be inevitabl e. In fact, do not place the junction where the opposing tooth would ride across it during an excursion. This situation m ay also cause the porcelain to flake, especially if the substructure is poorly designed. 2.5.2.1.  Anterior  Design. Because occlusal co ntacts should  not occu r at the m etal-ceramic junction, the contact must occur either on the metal framework or on the porcelain (Figure 2.7). Keep the metal-ceramic junction well away (2 mm) from the MI contact point. If you don’t, the metal may flex and cause the porcelain to fracture. 124  Figure 2.6. Porcelain Shoulder Margin. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 2.7. Metal-Ceramic Design for Anterior Crowns.   2.5.2.2. Posterior Design (Figure 2.8):  2.5.2.2.1. In the m axillary arch, the posterior d esign is fairly sim ple because the s hearing cusps do not occlude in MI nor should they function during an excursion. On a premolar, the metal-ceramic junc tion is located ac ross the buc cal triangu lar ridge. If  the m etal-ceramic junction is placed  too close to  the fossa, the porcelain w ill  fracture (Figuare 2.8 -A). The pattern sho uld be wax ed with eno ugh space f or porcelain  or adequate m etal con tact to support porcelain.  2.5.2.2.2. W ith the mandibular arch, the problem   of where to place the m etal-ceramic junction becomes more difficult depending on the situation. In  Figure 2.8-B, the mandibular buccal cusps are made of metal to lessen the ris k of porcelain fracturing . This design is not very esthetic; it should be used only when th e patient’s exhibits group function occlusion in lateral m ovements. If  mutually p rotected or  anterior guidance occlusion is provided, the design shown in Figure 2.8-C or -D is recomm ended. Also notice that like m aterials, metal-to-metal and porcelain-to-porcelain, are made to contact one another in occlusion. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 2.8. Placement of the Metal-Ceramic Junction on Posterior Occlusals. 125   2.5.3. Proximal Contacts. The proxim al contacts of anterior  restorations should be in porcelain. This is the most esth etic design, and it of fers the most latitude in cont ouring the veneer. Do not place the metal-ceramic junction lingually as far as  the proximal wing of the prep aration because this would result in a thin area and thereby weaken the framework (see Figure 2.9). For premolars, place the m esial contact in po rcelain for esthetic  reasons. The distal contact m ay be in m etal. Generally, molar contacts are made in metal. 2.5.4. FPD Design:  th ickness of porcelain to prevent uneven stress 2.5.4.1. All the principles of fra mework design that  apply to single units would also apply to FPDs. In addition, FPD fra meworks require more strength because of connectors. Frameworks must not flex or bend, causing the porcelain to  fracture. There must be a large enough m ass of metal to ensure rigidity, plus uniformconcentrations in the porcelain.  2.5.4.2. The typical design for an anterior FPD is in Figure 2.10. Notice the continuous width of metal across the lingual surfaces. The lingual finish  line m ay also be scalloped to ad d length and bulk in the connectors. If needed, this connect or design is also easier to solder. Also, be sure to make the connectors wide enough buccal-lingually for adequate strength.  2.5.4.3. Porcelain coverage of the pontics is basically the same as for retainers. EXCEPTIONS: Porcelain is applied to ridge areas for better es thetics and to prevent possible tissue irritation, and the porcelain veneers of pontics should be continuous with the veneers of retainers. 2.5.4.4. From a m esial or distal vi ew, the contour of the m etal surface must appear to closely follow the contour of the porce lain veneer (Figure 2.11). A t least 1 m m of porcelain should cover the facial surface,  while an  absolute m inimum of 0.5 mm  of coverage is n eeded on th e pontic’s tissue side. Possible irritation of the gi ngival tissues could result from  contact with a rough metal-ceramic junction. Therefore, the pontic’s lingual finish line is placed lingually and incisally to the crest of the ridge. 126  Figure 2.9. Improper Placement of the Metal-Ceramic Junction. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 2.10. Typical Metal-Ceramic Substructure for Anterior FPDs.    2.6. Waxing. Patterns should follow the desi gns described in paragraph  2.5. Wax all single complete crown and multiple co mplete crown retainer patterns to a m inimum thickness of  0.4 mm in the veneer provide enough bulk to ensure a areas. This thickness is needed to  strengthen the wax pattern and complete casting. The wax has to have uniform thickne ss and be wrinkle free if  the pattern is to cast without holes or voids. 2.6.1. Coping Preparation: 2.6.1.1. One of the m any ways to lay down a well-ada pted coping for this kind of pattern is to dip the die into m olten wax until th e wax com pletely covers the cerv ical margin. Use a wax specifically m ade for wax dipping.  Dip the d ie as m any tim es as  it takes to get the desired thickness. Adjust your technique so one coat of wax will equal 0.4 mm.  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 2.11. Metal-Ceramic Design for Pontics. 127   2.6.1.2. Wax the m argins and cervical area, usi ng regular inlay wax or follow the dual wax technique, using a h arder inlay wax (type A).  Use the dual wax techniq ue because the harder inlay wax used for the marginal area resists distortion. You can also wax copings free hand, but use care to prevent internal wrinkles and voids in the pattern.  2.6.1.3. After making the coping, remove it to ensure  that undercuts do not prevent rem oval of the  completed  pattern. Com plete the full contour wae mentioned in Section 1J. x-up, using the wax-added techniqu2.6.2. Cutback Technique. Study the full contour wax-up carefu lly. Make mental notes about the occlusion and overall appearance of  the waxup. Better still, m ake an impression of the wax-up to serve as a guide during the porcelai n application procedures. An ideal  method is to m ake a facial index of the full contour wax-up with a silicone  putty impression material. Pour this index with stone to m ake a perm anent record of the wax-up and the opposing teeth. Cut the index in half below the incisal (occlusal) edge to expose the imp ression from an occlusal view. Then, use it to check the amount of cutback on the wax substructure (Figure 2.12). However, you will not be able to use this index during the porcelain application st ep so be sure to m ark the width and length of the restorations on the opposing cast for future reference.  Figure 2.12. Facial Core Used To Check Cutback.  128  2.6.3. Single Crown Cutback (Figure 2.13):  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.6.3.1. The first step in  performing the veneer cutback area is to scribe th e outline of that area on the pattern using a No. 25 blade (Figure 2.13-A ). Place the proximal metal-ceramic junction of anterior units as far lingual as possible.  2.6.3.2. Using a sharp instrum ent, car ve away 1.5 mm  from the in cisal edge of the pattern (Figure 2.13-B). Then use a di scoid carver to provide a nice , smooth butt joint between the  metal and the porcelain and to also place vertical grooves (depth cuts) in the center of the labial surface (Figure 2.13-C).  Use these grooves to m easure the depth of wax in the veneer area, which should be at least 1 mm deep.   Figure 2.13. Cutback Technique for Crown Patterns.   2.6.3.3. Remove the rem aining wax with a #25 blad e or sim ilar instrument, leaving a sm ooth veneer surface with a sharp clean metal ceramic junction. If the crown is to have a metal collar, leave a .5 m m cervical collar on th e facial one-h alf of  the pattern. This width helps to ensure strength of the pattern and complete casting of the facial marginal area. Later, reduce the width of the collar in m etal to the minimum 0.3 mm thickness (a bulk that resists distortion when the  porcelain cools from its firing temperature).  2.6.3.4. If a porcelain margin is prescribed rem ove the wax from the fac ial margin area to th e junction of the facial axial wall of the wax  leaving the shoulder margin exposed. 2.6.3.5. Use a wax gauge to check the thickness of  the facial cutback (Figure 2.13-D). The wax should measure at least 0.4 mm. If not, add wax to provide enough bulk. Also inspect the inside of the pattern for thin areas of wax that might cause an incom plete casting. Smooth the completed pattern, being careful not to destroy the nice, crisp finish lines or intricate anatomy. 2.6.3.6. Replace the die and pattern on the working cast and check the occlusion and placement of finish lines. From  various angles (m esial, distal, and o cclusal profiles), inspect the cutback for amount of reduction  (Figure 2.1 3-E and -F).  Remember, the m etal surface should parallel the contour of the finished rest oration. There are usually two areas of concern, the mesiodistal  curvature and the occlusogingival curvature of the facial surfaces of teeth. Alm ost always, the pattern and the shoulder,AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  129 wax pattern should be “rolled in” on these surfa ces, especially anterior units. The tendency is for novice technicians to m ake their substructu res “box-like” without allowing for the natural esthetic curvature of all teeth. 2.6.3.7. The final step is to adapt  the margins before spruing a nd investing. Carefully rem ove the wax pattern and check for defects such as br oken or frayed margins, overextended margins, and short margins. Use a microscope to check the margin while the wax-up is on the die. Some technicians also prefer to att ach a small wax knob to the lingua l collar. They use this knob for  removing the crown during the try-in and,  in som e instances, as  a h older while build ing porcelain layers. 2.6.4. FPD Patterns. Waxing multiple unit wax substruc tures is m uch like waxing single un its. Each retainer is reduced the same way an individual unit is (Figure 2.14). The difficulty lies in the cutback of  the pontics. Either c arefully cut bac k the pontic  while it is  attach ed to  one of  the retainers or section the pontic from its retainers and cut back the pontic individually. Bear in mind that once you rem ove the pontic, you m ust repos ition it precisely so you do not destroy the occlusal relationships originally established.  Review paragraph 2.5.4 for a description of FPD substructure design.  Figure 2.14. Cutback Technique for FPD Patterns.   2.7.  Spruing. For the most part, m etal-ceramic substructu re patterns  can be sp rued the s ame as conventional alloys, but lower density and increased m elting range make the metal-ceramic alloys more susceptible to casting porosity. This porosity, whether deep inside the metal or on the surface, can create subsurface bubbles in the porcelain, which will weaken  the veneer. Due to the sensitive nature o f these alloys, it would be better to ad apt the standard sprui ng, investing, and casting techniques to coincide with the particular metal-ceramic alloy being used. 2.7.1.  General  Observations. To m ake the best possible casti ngs, f ollow these principles: (1) make sure the sprue  former’s diameter corresponds to the v olume of the pattern  (larger patterns need thicker sprues); (2) when using direct spposition patterns in the investm ent mold so they ar e 3 to 6 mm  from the top and their reservoirs are within the thermal zone. 2.7.2. Sprue Former Attachment: ruing, avoid constrictions in the sprue; and (3) 130  2.7.2.1. Single Units:  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.7.2.1.1. Sprue single anterior un its on the incisal edge (Fi gure 2.15). This way, you can place the sprue former at an angle that will direct molten metal into the thinnest areas of the casting as well as the th ick areas. If the wax is thin in an area, add a sm all ridge of wax to that surface to act as an auxiliary sprue. No rmally, copings are thick eno ugh to allo w for a complete casting. Spruing to the veneer area  positions the sprue away from the m argins and makes finishing a lot easier. Sp rue posterior w ax patterns on  the lingual cusp because of their large bulk.  NOTE: This m ethod m ay distort prev iously established occlusal relationships. To preserve occlusal contacts on maxillary waxups, sprue to the facial cutback area, taking  care to direct th e  flow of  m etal a cross the oc clusal tab le, toward th e thicke r areas.   Figure 2.15. Direct Spruing of Wax Substructure Patterns.  2.7.2.1.2. Most single unit castings can  be m ade from  a single sprue.  Rarely  will a wax pattern req uire an au xiliary spru e for mer. Judge each case on its individual m erits. Remember the following rule: sprue size and sprue placement depends on the volume of the wax pattern. Normally, the sprue former is made of wax and is at least 10 gauge in diameter. 2.7.2.2.  FPD  Patterns. The m ost common ways of  spruin g FPDs and m ultiple s ingle units  involve the indirect an d direct m ethods. For best results, spruing m ethod described in paragraph 1.52.4.3. Placement of pattern sprues is the same as paragraph 2.7.2.1.  use the indirect2.7.3. Chill Vents. Use chill vents to rem ove gases from the mold and to transfer heat away from the casting. The logical placem ent of chill vents  is on the bulkiest areas of the wax patterns—th e connectors (Figure 2.16). To construct a chill ve nt, attach an 18-gauge  round wax wire about 6 mm long to each connector. This chill ven t will  draw heat away from the pontic an d connector, preventing porosity in those areas.   AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 2.16. Placement of Chill Vents on a Substructure Pattern. 131  2.7.4. Pattern Position: 2.7.4.1. Wax patterns should be 3 to 6 mm from the end of the ring so gases can escape through the porous investm ent as the rushing m etal enters the m old. The chance of back -pressure porosity or an incom plete casting increases if this gas is no t eliminated. Because ph osphate-bonded investm ents are stronger than gypsum -bonded investm ents, the danger of the m old cracking is not as great and strength is not a problem.  2.7.4.2. Another factor involves place ment of pa tterns outside the  thermal zone (Figure 2.17). After the molten metal enters the mold, heat is transferred to the investment and concentrated in the center of the ring. The m olten m etal  in this area (therm al center or  thermal  zone)  will solidify last due to the h otter investment temperature. If the pattern is in the thermal zone, the feeder sprues could freeze before th e pattern does. Place the pattern above or to one side of the thermal zone so that the casting will cool first and then the sprues.  Figure 2.17. Placement of Metal-Ceramic Patterns Outside the Thermal Zone.  2.7.5. Orientation Dot. Besides depending on the force gene rated by a spring-wound casting arm to fill a burned-out mold, it is critical that the mold gets maximum benefit from the natural flow of  132  molten metal during the casting procedure. Use the or ientation dot method to indicate the relative position of the invested pattern inside a ring (paragraph 1.52.4.5). AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.8. Investing. The procedures used for investing m etal-ceramic substructures are like those used with conventional gold castings. Phosphate-bonded investments must be used with ceram ic alloys because of their high heat capabilittemperatures greater than 1300  oF, giving off a sulfur gas. Not only is  the strength and  accuracy of the  s can contam inate the alloy. Phosphate-bonded mold reduced by this breakdown, but sulfur galiquid to control part of the expa nsion. This liquid is a colloidal investments generally use a special silicate that can be diluted with  water to provide vari ous am ounts of  investment setting expansion. Undiluted liquid provides maximum setting expansion. ies. Gypsum -bonded investm ents tend to break down when heated to 2.8.1. Mold Expansion: 2.8.1.1 When using phosphate-bonded investments, mold expansion is affected by:   special liquid to water (m ore special liquid, m ore 2.8.1.1.1. Using more layers of asbestos substitute to line the casting ring. 2.8.1.1.2. Increasing the ratio ofexpansion). 2.8.1.1.3. Placing the investm ent in contact  with water during setting (hygroscopic technique). 2.8.1.1.4. Burning out the m old at a higher temper ature. If your castings are too large and you want to decrease the am ount of expansion, tr y the opposite approach with any or all of the above methods. 2.8.1.2. The size of the casting ring affects the seating of castings. If too m any patterns are crammed into one casting ring, expansion of the mold cavity will be uneven. Also, the castin gs will not be as precise n or will th ey fit their p reparations. Therefore, be sure to use  the larg er oval or round rings to produce FPDs that will seat more completely. 2.8.1.3. “Ringless” casting system s may also be us ed to gain added expansion. These system s do not use solid m etal casting rings, and they vary in design from  dis posable wax for ms to reusable pla stic cylinde rs. The s imilarity all  ringless casting system s share is u nrestricted expansion during burnout. 2.8.2. Investment Procedures:  mix. After mechanically m ixing the ingredients together 2.8.2.1. Use a separate mixing bowl for each type of investment (one for phosphate-bonded and one for gypsum-bonded investments). Particles of other investment types can alter the chemical and physical properties of the (manufacturer’s powder-to-liquid ratio and m ixing tim es), continue to vibrate the m ix under  vacuum for an additional 15 seconds to remove ammonia gas th at escapes a s part of the chemical reaction taking place. Small metal nodules on the underside of the casting are a direct result of this gas escaping.  2.8.2.2. It m ay also be necessary  to change the m ixing tim es because som e m ixing bowls become worn and will generate heat, caus ing the mix to suddenly harden. Either inspect th e equipment and replace it or spatulate the m ix for a sho rter period of time. After investing the pattern, let the ring bench set for at least 60 minutes before burning out. 2.9. Burnout: 2.9.1. Follow m anufacturer’s directions for burnout tem perature, rate of te mperature climb, and AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  133 hold tim e. Large rings  will ne ed more tim e accord ing to their size . In any ca se, keep th e investment at the recommended te mperature until the  co lor of  th e investm ent has com pletely whitened. A dark shado w in the  center of the in vestment indicates carbon residue still left in the investment mold. The physical properties of some metal-ceramic alloys, especially high palladium content alloys, is greatly affected by carbon, making the use of a carbon-free investment desirable.  2.9.2. W hen using prefor med plas tic sprue form ers, you should begin the burnout sequence gradually, before increasing the temperature to 1300  oF. Usually 30 minutes at 600  oF is sufficient to soften the plastic and allow the wax to run out. All burnout times and temperature should follow exactly the instructions of the investment’s manufacturer and of the particular alloy being used. 2.10.  Casting. Ceram ic m etals ar e m elted in a quartz or z ircon-alumina crucib le (m ade to withsta nd higher temperatures) and cast at 2300 to 2500  oF. Because of their lo wer densities and critical casting temperatures, they n eed more casting force. Ins tead of winding the casting arm  only 3 1/2 to 4 tim es, wind it 4 1/2 to 5 times. Also, do not use casting flux  during the melt because it can remove some of the trace elements in the alloy. Use a separate crucible  to melt different types of alloys, thereby preventing alloy contamination. 2.10.1. Adjusting the Torch. Use a gas-oxygen casting to rch with a multiorifice tip. Regulate the oxygen pressure to 8 pounds per square inch (psi), w ith the propane gas be tween 6 to 8 psi. NOTE: Bottled propane under constant pressure produces a cleaner, hotter flame than natural gas. Use caution in lighting the torch. Always add  oxygen to the gas flame and always remove oxygen from the gas flam e in shutting off the torch. A co rrectly adjusted torch w ill produce a fairly soft, shower flame with the small blue reducing cones about 5 mm in length. The reducing nature of the flame indicates a slight excess in propane gas left unoxidized. Too m uch oxygen added to the  flame causes oxygen gas absorption by the gold, a nd resulting in m inute porosity throughout the casting. Hydrogen gas absorption by palladium  is also a problem , especially in the higher content palladium alloys. 2.10.2. Melting the Alloy: 2.10.2.1. Preheat the crucible to a du ll red to drive off m oisture and prevent a cold spot at the base of the crucible. A lumina or quartz crucib les are s elf-glazing an d do not need a liner. oF above their upper lim it) Ceramic alloys are usually superheated (white hot—about 100 before they are cast. Wear dark colored glasses to prevent an eye injury from the bright light of the hot metal.  2.10.2.2. Place the alloy in the crucib le’s center and start the melt with the tip about 3  or 4 c m from the alloy. Continue heating the alloy, watching it change color from red, to orange, to dull white, to a mirror-like white. When the alloy is orange, transfer the ring from the furnace to the cradle. When the alloy is white hot and mirror-like, release the casting arm and let spin until the casting arm comes to a complete stop. Then remove the casting ring and let it bench cool.  2.10.2.3. When the ring is cool enough to handle,  remove the casting and pick off most of the  investment. Carefully air abrade the casting with alum inum oxide to remove any rem aining investment. 2.10.3.  Alternative  Casting  Method. Another casting m ethod uses electric m eans of induction melting. Induction casting m achines, sim ilar to the  Ticomatic, can be used to cast all types of ceramic alloys, but they are especially helpful when using base metal alloys. More information on induction casting is in Chapter 3, paragraph 3.8.2. 2.11. Finishing. See Figure 2.18-A through -F. Overall, the th ree objectives in finishing the porcelain-rovide clean surfaces for thebearing areas of castin gs for m etal-ceramic restor ations are to: (1) p AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 134  chemical bonding of porcelai n and m etal, (2) provide the ideal surf ace tex ture tha t will inc rease the  wetting ac tion between the porcela in and m etal, and (3) r eturn the m etal subs tructure to p reviously established contours, taking full ad vantage of the porcelain’s physical  characteristics (preparation of a  porcelain-to-metal junction, placement of the junction,  and overall design of th e framework). While the goal is to make a wax pattern that only requires m inimal finishing, chances are some recontouring may be needed as follows:  Figure 2.18. Surface Preparation of a Metal-Ceramic FPD.  2.11.1. Precautions:   2.11.1.1. Only use new finishing stones and burs or those used exclusivel y on a particular  ceramic alloy to prepare porcelain -bearing su rfaces (Figure 2.18-A). Indiscrim inate use of  finishing equipment can cause contamination by copper, silver, zinc, or chromium alloys. If the surface is unusually rough or is contaminated by using “dirty” stones, the result m ay be severe blistering of the opaque layer.  2.11.1.2. Furthermore, only use abrasives that are fu sed together with a ceram ic binder. Do not use rubber wheels or abrasives he ld together with epoxy resins  or silica binders. If you are unsure about using an abrasive ston e or po int, place a s ample of it  in a porcelain fu rnace and fire to 1000 oC. If the abrasive does not turn to powd er, it has a ceramic binder. Ceramic points either have carborundum or aluminum oxide as an abrasive particle; the latter abrasive is better.  2.11.1.3. Single-cut carbide burs m ake the best fini shing instrum ents. They sharply cut the metal surface, producing lower roughness and very  few undercuts or concav ities. Try to grind on the castings in one direction only since cris s-cross strokes m ay cause folding of the m etal surface and impurities could become trapped. 2.11.2. Seating the Casting and Restoring Occlusion. Before despruing the casting, check to see that it fits  the die and the m argins are com plete. Use a disc or abrasive  wheel to recontour the sprue attachm ent area (Figure  2.18-B) and remove gross am ounts  of m etal from the proximal contacts. D o not use “heatless” stones because they can contam inate  the m etal. Rubber the  contacts smooth into light contac t with the ad jacent teeth. If the occlu sion is h igh, reduce it to bring the restoration back into MI. Check the amount of clearance available for porcelain coverage AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  135 in centric as well as through working, balancing, a nd protrusive excursions. If there is not enough space, reduce the m etal substructure.  NOTE: If  the  f ramework is  to   be presoldered (paragraph 2.27), do it at this time and before reducing the bulk metal.  2.11.3. Reducing Bulky Areas: (NOTE: Areas that normally require attention are adjacent to the metal-ceramic junction and connector areas.)  porcelain is applied, nough to resist flexing of the m2.11.3.1. Use a fresh #8 carbide bur to prepare th e metal-ceramic junction. Retrace the m etal-ceramic junction, m aking a 90-degree angle prep aration (Figure 2.18-C ). The resulting finish line should be sharp and continuous. Everywhereit m ust end abruptly without feathering onto the m etal and the shallow concavit y created must encircle the m etal support evenly and smoothly, reducing all traces of sharp angles or points. 2.11.3.2. Make sure the connectors are strong eetal, yet positioned where they will not co mpromise esthetics. Should the metal flex, the porcelain will fracture and the veneer will break o ff. Doubling the connectors width makes it twice as strong, but doubling its depth increases the strength by a fact or of eight. If a force (F) of 1 is a pplied to a three-unit FPD, flexing of the metal will only be minimal (Figure 2.19). However, if the same force (F) is applied to a four-unit FPD, the amount the metal flexes will be eight tim es greater. The minimum width of a connector  for a three-unit FPD is 2.5 mm ; the minimum depth is also 2.5 mm.  2.11.3.3. You can verify these dim ensions by m easuring the thickness with a m etal gauge (Figure 2.18-D). If the connectors are too thick faciolingually, they will make contouring of the embrasures more difficult. You m ay accidentally expose the m etal framework while trying to shape th e inte rproximals with aocclusogingivally, they may impinge on the ging ival tissues. The bulk of the connector should be as high as possible and towards the lingual. n ultra thin disc. If the connectors are too thick  Figure 2.19. Law of Beams.  2.11.3.4. Dentists are often conservative in the am ount of tooth structure rem oved for a m etal-ceramic restoration. If this is the case, reduce the entire facial surface of the metal framework to the minimum 0.3 mm noble m etal thickness (0.2 mm  for base m etal alloys). However, if you  136  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 reduce the thickness to these dim ensions, the ri sk of the fra mework flexing and porcelain fracturing is much greater. Using a metal gauge, measure the thickness of the metal at different spots (Figure 2.18-E). Areas of i mportance are  towards the facioincisal, which m ay cause the opaque porcelain to be visible, and the entire lingual surface, due to close bite conditions.  2.11.3.5. Avoid thin areas of m etal, as you m ight accidentally make a hole in the casting. If a casting has a large thin area, it must definitely be remade. Also check to see if th ere is at least 0.5 mm of c learance under the pont ic for porcelain coverage. To reduce large areas of m etal, ® wheel. Sandpaper discs ar e also effective in use a double separating disc or Busch Silentsmoothing large areas and gently rounding the m etal’s surface. Always go over the entire porcelain-bearing surface with a  #203 stone as the last step be fore moving on to treating the metal surface (Figu re 2.18-F). Move the #203  stone in  one direction to crea te satin finish that will enhance the mechanical bond of the porcelain to the metal. 2.11.3.6. Re member that undercontoured m etal can cr eate thick porcelain areas that cause support and shade control problems. Porcelain that is not properly supported (more than 2 mm) is prone to f racture. If  the porcelain  is too thic k in an area , it will af fect the sh ade, large ly because the shade is con trolled by the presence of opaque, dentin, and enamel porcelains. Too much of one and not enough of th e other alters the shade. If  the opaqued fra mework does not extend far enough (either incisally or  gingivally) light will simply  pass directly through. In this instance, the pontic will appear grayer than the retainers due to increased translucency. 2.11.4. Nonporcelain-Bearing Areas. Confine finishing of these areas to  light finishing only, not to polishing. Rubbering m etal  adjacent to the porce lain-bearing areas could contam inate the prepared su rface. The only exceptions include r ubbering m etal contact areas to  finalize th e proximal contact or the m argins if you doubt th eir completeness. All other nonporcelain-bearing areas can be ligh tly finished with a fine ab rasive to recontou r areas and  to remove wrinkles and pits. 2.11.5. Removing Contamination. If a high-gold content alloy fra mework has been finished on a metal die (copper, silver, or am algam), boil it in  nitric acid 1 m inute a nd then pickle it in hydrochloric acid. This p rocedure eliminates any possibility of contamination from the metal die. If using a white ceramic alloy, consult the manufacturer’s instructions for its behavior in acids.  Section 2D—Porcelain Application and Firing 2.12. Pretreatment of the Metal Surface. Treatment of the metal surface prior to porcelain application varies with the base-m etal elem ents, such as  tin,  indium, and  iron,  to precip itate on the surf ace and produce an oxide film. Alloys that contain greater amounts of base-metal elements (notably nonprecious alloys) produce thicker oxide layers. In contrast, high-gold content alloys with far lesser amounts of base elements produce fewer surface ox ides. For this  reason, bond strength v aries greatly depending on the types of allo y and su rface pretreatments. Strictly adhere to th e manufacturer’s instruction on preparing the metal surface. (The use of metal conditioners is discussed in paragraph 2.12.7.) 2.12.1.  Overview. Use any or all of the following procpretreat the metal surface: edures (liste d in  sequential order) to 2.12.1.1. Surface grinding. 2.12.1.2. Ultrasonic cleaning with distilled water or steam cleaning. 2.12.1.3. Heating under vacuum at 1040 oC for 2 minutes. 2.12.1.4.

Heating at atmospheric pressure at 1040 oC for 2 minutes. 137 fore porcelain is applied, they could cause the 2.12.2.  Surface  Grinding. Norm ally consider ed the last s tep in the m etal f inishing process,  surface g rinding is  don e to  rem ove defects  an d m ake final ad justments. It  is also  expected to increase the m echanical bond between the porcelain  and metal. This finishing procedure is best accomplished by using a carbid e bur and grind ing in only on e direction. If you leave the surface rough, it can create stresses w ithin the porcelain veneer. From  this point on, handle the castings with forceps or the lik e to prev ent contaminating the porcelain-bear ing surfaces with oil and d irt from your fingers. 2.12.3. Ultrasonic Cleaning. The purpose of using an ultrasonic at  this time is to c lean the metal surface. Abrasive particles, dirt, and oils that may have attached to the surface during grinding can be removed by using distilled wate r in a ultrasonic. If oily re sidue remains on the ground surface, it will bake on the m etal su rface as a contam inant. Steam  cleaning is also effectiv e for this purpose. 2.12.4.  Heating  Under  Vacuum. The term  “oxidation” describe s the heating process used to produce a controlled ox ide layer on the metal’s surface and to disp el gases absorbed by the m etal during casting. If these gases aren’t released beopaque to bubble at the interface between metal and porcelain. These gas bubbles will even tually migrate to the surface where th ey become visible. The resultant  holes can be repaired; but each time the porcelain is fired under vacuumframework under vacuum to 1040 oC for 2 minutes will drastically decrease bubbling. 2.12.5. Deoxidizing. Some metal-ceramic alloys produce  excess amount of oxides that decrease bond streng th and dark en the m etal surface. A ir abrading the m etal s urface will deoxidize th e castings and, to som e extent, expose “fresh” metal for reoxidation.  NOTE: Do not deoxidize castings m ade from  high-gold content alloys.  These alloy s produce fewer surface oxides and deoxidation could strip the metal surface of its base-metal atoms. 2.12.6.  Heating  at  Atmospheric  Pressure. A second oxidation finish m ay be  indicated to improve the oxide film ’s quality an d color. Ea ch m etal-ceramic alloy, when properly oxidized , will have a characteristic appearance. Precious metal alloys containing tin should have an optimal oxide film  com posed of dense tin oxide (SnO 2), which appears grayish-white in color. The appearance of nonprecious alloys af ter oxidation varies so much th at it would be impractical to discuss here. Instead, refer to th e manufacturer’s instructions. Rep eat heating as needed, but take  care no t to  overtreat th e m etal surface and dist urb the fragile oxide film. When you observ e interfacial bubbling of the porcelain, it is best to strip the framework and lightly refinish the metal surface with a carbide bur before proceeding again. 2.12.7. Metal Conditioning Agents. Use metal conditioning agents to enhance the metal-ceramic bond or, when using silver-bearing alloys, to prevent staining of the porcelain veneer: , the  risk of escaping gas increases. Heating the 2.12.7.1. Gold Metal Conditioners: 2.12.7.1.1. The 24K gold m etal condition ers reduce th e apparen t silver conten t on the surface of the alloy when properly fired. Theory predicts that the silver content at the surface drops sharply to about 15 percent due to the addition of the gold. As the percentage of silver decreases, so does the p robability of disco loration. Because gold m etal conditioners do not form oxides, the bond strength between porcelain and metal m ay dim inish using this technique.  2.12.7.1.2. One m anufacturer adds s mall plati num beads to its m etal conditioner for 138  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 mechanical retention of porcel ain, claiming it dram atically strengthens m etal and porcelain bonding. G old m etal condition ers, having  a char acteristic colo r com pliment with natu ral teeth, are also indirectly responsible for lightening the shade of the veneer porcelain. 2.12.7.2.  Ceramic  Metal  Conditioners. These  m aterials a ct as a b arrier layer b etween the  metal and porcelain, preventing the porcelain from contacting the metal surface. 2.12.7.3. How To Use Metal Conditioners. To use m etal conditioners, prepare a thin m ix of powder and liquid. Apply a thin coat of conditioner to the metal surface to be conditioned. Dry the coat of conditioner and then fire it to a s light sheen. Remove the fr ame and cool it before applying th e opaque porcelain. W hen using a m etal condition er, f ollow the m anufacturer’s instructions regarding porcelain application. 2.13. Opaque Porcelain. Opaque porcelain serves a three-fold  purpose; it m asks or hides the color of the underlying m etal, it sim ulates the dentin of  a natural tooth and com plements the dentine shade porcelain, and it combines with the metal surface oxide to form a powerful bond. 2.13.1. Applying: 2.13.1.1. Measure out the correct amount of opaque  powder onto a flat glas s slab or ceram ic dish. Using a glass m ixing rod or nylon spatul a, m ix the powder with m odeling fluid (or opaquing liquid) to a cream y consistency. Modeli ng fluid is a com bination of glycerin and distilled water that prevents the porcelain from  drying out. Before applying the first m asking coat of opaque, apply an initia l, thin “wash coa t” of opaque porcelain. This in itial application increases the wetting action of the opaque to the metal.  thin 2.13.1.2. Using a #6 sable hair brush, slightly mo isten the casting with fluid and apply a slurry of opaque. Place the cas ting on the firing platform  (predrying is not necessary) and fire the casting 600 to 960 oC at 32 oC per minute in a vacuum.  2.13.1.3. To apply the first coat of  opaque, pick up a ball of porce lain on the brush and let it lightly con tact the m etal su rface (Figure 2.20 -A). Move the bru sh d own the m etal and the opaque will follow it in a thin film. Continue to repeat this procedure until the entire porcelain-bearing area is cov ered. It is im portant to work quickly so the opaque  stays we t before it is condensed. Gently vibrate the opaque porcela in to sm ooth and condense the surface.  NOTE: Allow the c asting to co mpletely cool between porcelain applications. Al so, rewet the su rface with distilled water before making subsequent additions. 2.13.2. Drying. Dry the opaque in front of an open furn ace door or draw the m oisture away with the tip of a facial tissue. Re move any opaque por celain from the inside  of the casting or on the nonporcelain-bearing areas. 2.13.3. Firing. Place the casting on the firing platform. Insert the crown into the furnace and start the vacuum pump. Set the tem perature at 960  oC and the rate of tem perature rise to 32  oC per minute. When the furnace reaches the right temperature, immediately remove the casting and let it bench cool. (IMPORTANT: Firing times and temperatures presented in this section are for VMK 68® porcelain used with Olym pia® m etal. They do not necessarily apply to other porcelain or ceramic alloys.) 2.13.3.1. Properly calibrate the furnace. If you have  done so correctly, the fired op aque should have a matte finish or possibly a slight sheen similar to an eggshell surface. If the opaque has a glazed appearance, it was fired too high.  An expert ceramist always fires porcelain to maturity, as identified by its appearance. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  139 inating all m etal 2.13.3.2. Apply the second opaque layeshadows.

If the special opaque powders above are not available, try using other standard opaque powders or porcelain stains. The mo st practical use for opaque stai ning is at the  cervical and incisal areas.

Porcelain Application: 2.14.1. Condensing Porcelain. The process of packing the particles together and rem oving the water is known as condensing. The  methods used to condense the raw  porcelain m ass and your  experience as a ceramist will determine th e quality and the amount of  shrinkage of the processed veneer: 2.14.1.1. Porcelain Shrinkage: zes of particles to the porcelain powder’s  particle size and 2.14.1.1.1. The am ount of shrinkage is related to shape. Porcelain powders contain several sishrinkage. On the average, the volume shrinkage of porcelains is between 30 and 40 percent. This can be m isleading, though, because the am ount of linear shrinka ge is only about 14 percent. Usually, you would only be concerned  with the linear shrink age because m ost of the shrinkage occurs in overall length.  2.14.1.1.2. Some porcelain powders are  coarse grained, while others  are fine grained. Fine grained porcelain has im proved handling ch aracteristics and lower volum e shrinkage.

Methods of Condensing Porcelain: ll affect the am ount of shrinkage and 2.14.1.2.1. Your ability to condense the porcelain wicolor of the fired porcelain. If the porcelain is not condensed enough, extra air spaces between particles will m ake the buildup shri nk m ore and appear grayer. In contrast, porcelain that is well condensed  will shrink very little, be  exceptionally hard, and appear saturated with color. It is not  correct, however, to say that  if a little condensation is good, a lot must be better. Hypothetically, if  all th e air spaces were rem oved, the porcelain would lose a great deal of its translucency, making the veneer look less vital.  2.14.1.2.2. Be sure to com pare the shade of the re storation against its  shade tab each tim e a buildup is fired. This will let you know  how well your techniques are w orking. NEVER let the  porcelain  mass  dry  out  during  application. This is because dry porcelain can’t be condensed and it is hard to rewet the buildup once it dries out. Use the following four methods to condense porcelain:  2.14.1.2.2.1. Apply  vibration  by serrating or tapping with an instrum ent. This will eliminate large air bub bles o r spaces. However, it is hard  to con trol, and cracks  m ay unintentionally be created in the buildup. 2.14.1.2.2.2. Perform capillary action by blotting from the lingual  surface. In this way, the flow of moisture from the facial to the lingual will draw the particles closer together. 2.14.1.2.2.3. Perform  pressure packing by smoothing with a spatula or pressing with a clean tissue. 2.14.1.2.2.4. Continue by whipping or brushing the surface with  a large soft brush to f ill in the surface voids and remove loose particles. 2.14.1.2.3. The net effect of these four m ethods increases the am ount of surface tension  within th e b uildup. Surface ten sion is the actu al  driving  force  that tightly binds the m ass together. The entire condensation process can be described as being m ore molecular than mechanical. 142  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.14.2.  Preparation. Make su re the cas t is clean. Seal the surface contac t  areas with clear finger nail polish or cyanoacrylate glue to prev ent moisture absorption and contam ination of the porcelain. Using a wet brush,  adapt a clean piece of tis sue or rice paper over the ridge area. This will help keep porcelain from adhering to the cast and consequently aid in later removal of the buildup. Accurately seat the opaqued casting on its die. 2.14.3. Ready Materials. Measure out the dentin and enamel porcelains onto a glass slab or ceramic dish. Using a nylon m ixing spatula or glass rod, m ix the  dentin powder with distilled water to a thick consistency. If the m ix is too  wet, blot th e excess m oisture awa y f rom the powder bed with a clean  tissue. The condition of  the powder bed is im portant because the air bubbles that remain in the m ixture are a m ajor cause of porcelain failure. Also, you should be able to pick up small increments of the mix with an instrument or brush. The mix should not be so thin that it would drip off th e end of an instrum ent. If using color m odifiers in the buildup, simplify their placement by dyeing the separate mixes with food coloring. 2.14.4. Layering Technique. There are as m any different methods of porcelain  application as there are ceramic authorities, and each one has an a pproach to reproducing natural teeth. Som e authorities believe concessions have to be maporcelain and natural enamel and dentin. Others contend de ntal porcelain should be layered the same as natural teeth.favorable and the techniques are properly executed. Figure 2.20-D shows one approach used in building porcelain. 2.14.4.1. Applying Cervical Porcelain. Using a #6 sable hair brush, pick up a bead of cervical shade porcelain from the edge of the m ix. Start at the cervical collar and flow the m ix onto the opaque (Figure 2.20-E). Place each  increment of porcelain with a  gentle pushing and tapping action and absorb the ex cess water with a clean , dry tissue. Less cervical porcelain is used to  simulate youth; more is used for middle-aged or elderly dentition. 2.14.4.2.  Applying  Opacious  Dentin  (Figure  2.20-F). This m aterial was developed with greater opacity for us e in special sh ading situations. Opacious dentin is  an interm ediate shade porcelain, f alling between the cerv ical and den tin sh ade p orcelains. Use opacious dentin in place of cervical po rcelain around the necks of t eeth to slo w light pen etration to the opaque layer. In the darkened and sha dowed interden tal a reas, use  it to c reate color  and b rightness. Opacious dentin is espe cially helpful in corre cting the shad e difference between the pontic’s  gingival portion with that of th e re tainer’s. This difference  is  du e to  the ab sence of opaque porcelain on the pontic’s internal  surface layer and the dark reflect ion of the ging iva. Also use opacious dentin to create  den tin effects, and,   in very thin areas, to prevent opaque show-through. 2.14.4.3. Applying Dentin Porcelain (Figure 2.20-G):  Either  approach will y ield accep table  results if oral conditions are de for the optical differences between dental e porcelain dry out, leaving large voids in the 2.14.4.3.1. Build the dentin porcelain drop by drop, us ing a brush or apply a greater am ount of m aterial using a spatula. Do not let thbuildup. Gentle vib ration of the cast will bring  water to the surface where it can be blotted  away. Avoid heavy vibration becau se it tends to m ake the porcelain slump; and it m ay also displace internal color modifiers.  2.14.4.3.2. Control slu mping by pressing w ith a tissue on  the lingual surface to draw the moisture through the porcelain. As water is withdrawn, the particles pack closer together due to surface tension. Slightly overbuild the porpoint, the porcelain should be compact and moist. celain m ass to allow for shrinkage. At this AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  143 2.14.4.3.3. A brush additiv e techn ique is su itable when placing po rcelain m odifiers and  stains in the buildup as it progresses. On the other hand, the spatula technique is quicker and molding of the porcelain buildup is easier. 2.14.4.4. Cutback: 2.14.4.4.1. Note that no t only does the cutback create space for the enamel porcelain, but it also forms the shape of the na tural dentin with th e dentin porcelain. Th e amount of dentin porcelain remaining depends on th e shade selected and the firi ng shrinkage of the porcelain mass. There is also a relationship between th e amount of dentin, en amel, and age. Young teeth have larger pulp cham bers, more dentin, and less enam el than middle-aged teeth. The older the patient, the thicker the enamel layer becomes. 2.14.4.4.2. Using a bladed instrument, cut back the incisal third and proxim al surfaces (Figure 2.20-H and -I). Make two sm all grooves in the labial surface to  simulate mamelons. Check the thickness of dentin porcelain covering the opaque with an instrument. 2.14.4.5. Applying Enamel Porcelain: 2.14.4.5.1. Mix the enamel porcelain a little thinner than the dentin porcelain. If the buildup is too dry, moisten it slightly  before applying the enamel. Trying to add wet porcelain to an already dry buildup will cause entrapment of large air bubbles and areas of blotchy opacity. 2.14.4.5.2. Pick up a bead of enam el porcelain and apply it to the buildup. Continue to build up the incisal area until the original contour is established. The final buildup should extend 1 to 1.5 mm past the desired length (Figure 2.20- J). The enamel porcela in should blend well into the middle third or, for some shades, in to the gingival third of  the tooth. This enam el overlay prevents a visible line of demarcation and creates an illusion of depth. 2.14.4.6.  Completion. Using a thin blade, remove any porcelain from below the proximcontact area that m ight be in  an undercut (Figur e 2.20-K). Carefully rem ove the built up restoration from the cast. Rem ove any dirt particles that m ight be present because they will b e visible through the porcelain. Mois ten the m esial and distal c ontact areas of the buildup and apply clear porcelain to these areas (Figure 2.20-L). Smooth the completed buildup with a large soft brush to rem ove any loose particles. Clean  excess porcelain away from the m etal-ceramic junction, as well as porcelain particles inside the crown. Check the overall outline, contour, and detail of the buildup. Place the restoration to be fired on a sagger tray. al 2.14.5. Building FPDs: 2.14.5.1. Applying Porcelain. Follow the procedures in  paragraphs 2.14.4.1 through 2.14.4.3 when applying porcelain. 2.14.5.2. Cutback. One technician might prefer to build each unit separately and cut back each one separately, trying to be as uniform as possible. Another technician will build the entire FPD in dentin porcelain, cut back th e entire buildup, and then complete it with the application of enamel porcelain. Someone else would prefer to apply dentin porcelain a nd only cut back half of the buildup (Figure 2.20-M thro ugh -O). In this way, the enam el porcelain can be added to the cutback, using the adjoining buildup as a guide. 2.14.5.3. Contact Areas. Start by removing any porcelain that  may be in an undercut. Re move the buildup by gently pushing up on the retainers. If any porcelain should break off, add it back or rebuild it. Now add clear po rcelain to the mesial and distal contacts  and dentin porcelain to the ridge area (Figure 2.20-P). Be careful in vibrating to avoid making the porcelain slump. 144  2.14.5.4. Firing Shrinkage:  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.14.5.4.1. Firing shrinkage varies w ith the type of  restoration. The porcelain on single unit crowns shrinks towards the center of the bucauses stress in the porcelain in the interproximal areas as it is dr awn toward the  center of each unit. Some porcelain manufacturers recommend that each unit be separa ted by cutting through to the opaque, using a shar p instrument such as a razor  blade (Figure 2.21). Do this to relieve stress and prevent cracking in th e conventional buildup technique. The res ulting gap between the units is later filled in during the correction step. ildup. In the case of FPDs, firing shrinkage  Figure 2.21. Separating the Units.   2.14.5.4.2. An alternative method to separating the units is  to thoroughly precondense those areas where cracking is likely to occur. Usincervical and proximal areas and con dense. Then, place the restoration o n the working cast,  and complete the porcelain buildup. g this m ethod, first apply porcelain to the 2.14.6.  Building  Porcelain  Cusps  (Figure  2.22). There  are two ways of contr olling f iring shrinkage. Either porcelain can be built in two or  three bakes to full occlusion with the articulator closed or the porcelain can be built in one bake with the incisal pin opened one to two millimeters. Using the latter m ethod, occlusion is restored (paragraph 2.15). Because the second method is simpler, its description is presented below: and then refined duri ng the contouring step 4.4.1 and 2.14.4.2 for applying cervical or 2.14.6.1.

The clinical crown of a natural tooth is covered with enamel, creating a transition and depth of natura l color. The conventional layering technique does not provide this “wraparound” effect of ena mel. Use the modified layering technique as shown in Figure 2.23. It nearly copies natural dentition as follows: for building porcelain laye rs as in paragraph 2.14.4.1 2.14.7.1. Follow the basic technique through 2.14.4.3. 2.14.7.2. Cut back the incisal third,  proximal, and interproxim al surfaces of the dentine layer. Remove about 1 mm of porcelain from each surface. Be sure to draw accurate guidelines on the surface before cutback. The a mount of cutback  on the proxim al and interproxim al surfaces is especially difficult to determine. 2.14.7.3. Apply enam el porcelain to th e dentin layer. The enam el layer should be built up to resemble the contour of dentin porcelain prior to cutback. The enamel porcelain should extend slightly beyond the incisal edge to cover the dentin porcelain. 146  Figure 2.23. Wraparound Effect of Enamel. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005   2.14.7.4. Apply clear p orcelain to th e entire facial su rface. This  will p rovide dep th of color within the fired restoration. The completed buil dup should be 15 to 20 percent larger than the finished restoration. Because a clear porcelain la yer that is too thick makes the crown appear dark and gray, exercise care when constructing the dentin and enamel layer. 2.14.7.5. Once the facial surface is complete, cut back the lingual surface to make room for the next porcelain addition. Apply clear porcelain to  the prepared lingual surface to co mplete the wraparound effect. Completion of the buildup is the same as the basic layering technique. 2.14.8. Porcelain Margin Technique. The ideal preparation for a  collarless crown is a 90-degree shoulder preparation on the facial extending from one proximal surface to th e other. This type o f labial margin preparation allows you to butt the  porcelain directly to the  shoulder area. Alternate styles of margin preparation and casting design appear in Figure 2.24.  Figure 2.24. Margin Designs for Collarless Crowns.  2.14.8.1. Materials. In addition to the conventional materials, you will need: 2.14.8.1.1.

Porcelain separating medium (or m ineral oil) to use  as a release agent for the raw porcelain. 2.14.8.1.3.  Shoulder  porcelain  for building the porcelain m argin. Shoulder porcelain is gingival-shaded porcelain special ly prepared to  have a hig her s intering tem perature th an other m etal bonding porcelains. Many porcelain  manufacturers have shoulder porcelain available for use with their systems. 2.14.8.1.4. Medium for mixing the shoulder porcelain. Disti lled water is preferred, but it is sometimes difficult to remove the casting and  wet porcelain without fracturing the buildup. Some technicians prefer to m ix the shoulder po rcelain with the specia l liquid provided with phosphate bound investm ents. This special liqu id reacts with the  porcelain, cau sing it to stiffen. Specially prepared waxes h ave also been developed to m ix with porcelain. Mix 8 parts porcelain to 1 part wax by wei ght. Proponents of the wax technique say it works well in extremely difficult margin situations. 2.14.8.2. Procedures. It is difficult to achieve m arginal accuracy with porcelain, d ue to firing shrinkage. Therefore, porcelain margins must be built up two or three times until an acceptable fit is achieved. 2.14.8.2.1. Start by waxing the substructure as desi gned in Figure 2.25. Invest and complete the substructure in the usual manner. When finishing the casting, do not thin the metal at the labial shoulder because this  could weaken  the porcelain m argin. Also ensure the proxim al metal-ceramic junction meets the cervical margin abruptly at a 90-degree angle to reduce the chance of metal creep during firing. Opaque the casting.  Figure 2.25. Wax Patterns for Porcelain Margin Technique.   2.14.8.2.2. Apply a thin coat of cyanoacrylate glue  to the facial shoulder area. After the glue has dried, apply a light coat of separating medium. 2.14.8.2.3. Make the buildup in two steps. First ap ply a bulk of shoulder porcelain to the shoulder area. Carefully rem ove the casting  and dry the buildup (F igure 2.26). As the porcelain is drying, you m ay notice s mall dark ar eas on the surface. These dark areas are small amounts of organic matter in the porcelain. In this instance, the entire cervical margin will appea r black beca use of  the separa tor. Don’t f ire the porcela in until th is area has completely dried or porosity will result in the processed porcelain.  148  Figure 2.26. Applying Shoulder Porcelain in the Porcelain Margin Technique. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005   2.14.8.2.4. Once the porcelain has been  fired, add m ore shoulder  porcelain to the m arginal area to fill the gap and  repeat the firing process. When the crown is again cool, contour the processed p orcelain to  finalize th e facial  margin. The rem ainder of the construction sequence follows the normal metal-ceramic technique. 2.14.9. Dentin Effects (Figure 2.27). You can create a multitude of dentin effects in the den tin porcelain with porcelain powders called  effect powders or modifiers. Porcelain stains may also be used, but their intensity is hard to control. 2.14.9.1. Altered Shades. Basic hu e and ch roma changes can be m ade to a sm all area of the dentin porcelain or to the entire facial surface area of the veneer. 2.14.9.1.1. To increase chroma in a small area, start by building the porcelain to full contour and then carve away the porcel ain in the affected area (F igure 2.27-A). Next, apply the effect powder to that area, tapering the porcelain onto the sides (Figures 2.27-B and -C). The dentist may request that the entire gingival shade be altered, changing the hue of the veneer. 2.14.9.1.2. To m ake a predom inantly gray shade  appear yellower, first cover the opaque with a layer of porcelain that has a yellow hue (Figure 2.27-D and -E). Follow this layer with a layer of porcelain that has a gray hue. You can decipher the dom inant hue for a given shade porcelain by looking at the  shade guide. Whatever the desi red effect, you can m ake it by combining different porcelain shades. 2.14.9.2. Dentin Mamelons:  2.14.9.2.1. In m any c ases, dentin m amelons  (Figure 2.27-F) originate during the development of the teeth, appearing as three fi nger-like extensions of the dentine separating the incisal edge. 2.14.9.2.2. To simulate this effect.  the porcelain is built to full  contour and two grooves are cut into the incisal third (Fi gure 2.27-G). Then a sm all amount  of colorless porcelain is placed in each groove (Figure 2.27-H). The net effect  will be to increase the tran slucency in these areas. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  2.14.9.3. Discolored Fillings:  149 2.14.9.3.1. Discolored fillings (Figur e 2.27-I) are com posite or pl astic restorative materials that have discolored. They usually appearmarking their boundaries. 2.14.9.3.2. Build the porcelain to f ull contour and ho llow out the area to  be filled (Figure 2.27-J). Lightly coat the walls of  the cavity w ith yellow-brown  stain. Then fill  the cavity with a core of opaque porcelain followed by clear porcelain (Figure 2.27-K).  opaque like and have brown discoloration  Figure 2.27. Dentin Effects in Dental Porcelain.   150  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.14.10. Incisal Effects (Figure 2.28). These effects range from fine  check lines to strong orange hues. The effect of subtle shading of the incisal will drastically affect the appearance of the veneer. 2.14.10.1. Enamel Check Lines (Figure 2.28-A): 2.14.10.1.1. To adequately simulate a natural check line or crack,  reproduce it in depth. The reason for this is these defects in the enamel are difficult to reproduce with surface stains.  Figure 2.28. Incisal Effects in Dental Porcelain.  2.14.10.1.2. Build up the entire crow n, including enamel porcelain. Cut a V-shape wedge in the incisal third and  put it asid e to be rep laced later (F igure 2.28-B). N ow, with on e light stroke, apply yellow-white stai n to the ver tical wall and  remove any excess from  the facial surface with  a clean  brush. Do not work th e s tain into  th e porcelain.  Gently replace the wedge slice you saved earlier and seal the cu t by lightly tapping the cast on the bench top (Figure 2.28-C). Failure to seal the cut could lead to fissure cracks during firing.   AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  151 2.14.10.1.3. This effect is also acco mplished by creating and staining a ve rtical wall during initial layering of the incisal porcelain. This eliminates difficulties associated with replacing and sealing the V-shaped wedge. However, great ca re must be taken to ensure the stains are not disturbed while completing the incisal buildup. 2.14.10.2. Hypocalcification:  pear as a series of also hard to reproduce with surface 2.14.10.2.1. Note that white hypocalcified areas are stains. They often apwhite do ts tha t do n ot look  lik e natu ral hypocalcification (Figure 2.28-D). Th is effect is better treate d using white m odifiers or effect powders in the porcelai n buildup. W hite effects are better  created if they are applied in two or three layers (Figure 2.28-E). 2.14.10.2.2. Use a fine brush tip to pick up just the right quantity of white powder and gently rub it into place. Then cover the white powder  with enamel porcelain and repeat the process (Figure 2-27-F). 2.14.10.3. Blue Translucency:  2.14.10.3.1. Remember, natural teeth often appear  more translucent (Figure 2.28-G) at the mesial and distal incisal edges. 2.14.10.3.2. To create this effect, rem ove a sm all a mount of incisal porcelain from  the  mesial and distal prox imal surfaces (Figure 2.2 8-H). Apply blue stain  to these areas with a light stroke and overlay them with clear porcelain (Figure 2.28-I). Be careful not to rem ove too much incisal porcelain because this will cause the blue effect to be lost in the gra ying of incisal by the clear porcelain. 2.14.10.4. Incisal Orange Hue:  2.14.10.4.1. Notice how this effect appear s as an orange hue at the  incisal, just short of the incisal edge (Figure 2.28-J). The enamel outlines the orange effect like a halo. 2.14.10.4.2. To reproduce this effect, first scoop out  a section of ena mel porcelain from the facial surface of the incisal e dge (Figure 2.28-K ). Next, app ly orange stain to the prepared  area. Follow that with an application of clear porcelain (Figure 2.28-L). 2.15. First Dentin-Enamel Firing: 2.15.1. Drying. Let the buildup dry fully to keep from  releasing steam and causing large sections of the veneer to crack. T he amount of drying time depends on the am ount of moisture, which can be judged by the density of the m ass and elaps ed time from initial ap plication. Also, setting the  entrance temperature too high will fracture the porcelain. Dry and preheat gradually by moving the restoration closer to the hot z one of the furnance m uffle in stag es. The entire drying, preheating, and inserting process usually take s 3 to 6 m inutes, depending on the number of units to be fired. The entrance temperature should stay at 600 oC during this entire process. 2.15.2. Firing Sequence. Center th e restoration in the m uffle or on the firing platform  and close the m uffle door. Seal the vacuum cham ber and  start the vacuum  pum p. Do not increase the temperature until you get a full vacuum  of 26 to 29  inches of m ercury. Set the am perage control for a rate of rise of 32  oC per minute and set the tem perature control for the maturing point of the porcelain at 940 oC. When the restoration reaches 940 oC, release the vacuum and remove the fired porcelain immediately. Let the rest oration cool completely before  handling it.

Shaping the Sintered Porcelain Veneer: AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.16.1. Use abrasives designed for fini shing and polishing porcelain su rfaces to shape the veneer. Each type abrasive has a specific function (Figure 2.29). Certain rubber wheels and points are used to smooth and polish. B ulk-reducing wheels can be  used for m ost of the overall contour. These abrasive wheels rem ove porcelain quickly and  wear  at ab out the s ame rate as th e porcelain,  making them ideal for “roughing out” the restoration’s form.   Figure 2.29. Contouring Metal-Ceramic Restorations.  2.16.2. Various shaped diam ond-cutting instrum ents can also be used for shaping and characterizing the surface. When they are new, these devices cut  very quickly and should be used cautiously. An alternative to the “diamonds” would be mounted stones and points.   AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  153 2.16.3. Avoid using abrasives that have been used  on other m aterials. Each time you m ust refire the restoration, be sure to remove the porcelain’s glaze first by lightly air abrading the surface with aluminum oxide and then clean the restoration using an ultrasonic and di stilled water. (Review Chapter 1, Section 1H, Esthetics, before continuing.) ing, and protrusive excursions. W hen adjus ting the crown in  the crown for sintered (fired ) porcelain particles or other 2.17. Establishing the Overall Contour:  2.17.1. Initially, inspect the inside ofinterferences that m ight keep th e crown from  seating. Seat the crown on its die and verify its marginal accuracy. So metimes the m etal m ay distort u pon sinterin g, lifting away from  t he preparation’s shoulder (known as metal creep). If possible, adjust each proximal contact separately until th e crown is completely seated on the cast (Figu re 2.29-A).  W hen thr ough m aking adjustments, the crown should be in light con tact and smooth. The proximal surface can either be rubbered smooth or lightly finished with a sandpaper disc. 2.17.2. Next, resto re the functional occlusion of the  crown according to the dentist’s prescriptio n (that is, unilate ral ba lance or m utually pro tected  occlusion). Restore MI fi rst; th en adjust th e restoration in working, balancexcursive movem ents, be careful n ot to rem ove too m uch of the crown’s length. W hen the occlusion is correct, you can then adjust the length of the incisal edge until it matches the adjacent tooth (Figure 2.29-B). Also consider the linguoincis al line angle of the incisal edge. This angle may be steep or shallo w, showing vi sible signs of wear (wear facets ). Precision grinding of the incisal edge and embrasure form is an absolute must. 2.17.3. Using a bulk-reducing wheel, grind away enough porcelain from the facial surface until the curvature m atches the teeth being duplicated. The  mesiodistal and distofaci al lin e angles  are especially important because alm ost all ante rior tee th exhibit  a “rounding in” effect at their distofacial surface. From incisal an d proximal views (Figures 2.29-C and -D), insp ect the facial  contour and alignment of the incisal edge. 2.17.4. Frequently check the thickness of the veneer  with a m etal gauge, especially in the incisal third area. If the thickness measures less than 1.2 mm, chances are the opaque m ay be noticeable through the enam el porcelain. This “ light spot” of opaque is hard to  hide, using extrinsic stains. An alternative to this approach is to shape the restoration in a protruded  fashion, but esthetics of the restoration might be compromised. 2.17.5. Shape the cervical third of the veneer so the  contour is continuous with the cervical collar (Figure 2.29-E). If the crown is co llarless, also refine the porcelai n shoulder m argin at this time. Normally, the height of contour  of the crown (suprabulge area)  will correspond to the adjacent teeth. 2.17.6. Smooth the entire facial surface while ensuring all the line angles are correctly positioned. Inspect the shape of the labial su rface by viewing it from  several as pects. You should be able to line up the facial su rface of the  restoration with the adjac ent tooth. This exact symm etry is not always the goal, but use it as a guide. 2.17.7. Once you have defined the overa ll facial contour, start shap ing the lingual surfaces with  a small diamond wheel or ball diam ond (Figure 2 .29-F). The crown should ha ve a definite lingual  fossa with incisal edges correspond ing to th e ad jacent teeth. Check again to en sure the crown functions properly with the movements of the articulator in excursive positions. 154  2.18. Charactering the Veneer Surface: AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.18.1. Study the working cast or diagnostic aid  for surface details. Most teeth have a satin finish, and only th e high spo ts, such as ridge and point angles, will b e shiny.  Of ten sign s of  wear or  abrasion m ay change th e charac ter of older teeth. These teeth m ay appear sm oother, and som e facial anatomy (horizontal grooves, development lobes) may be absent. Only a close inspection of the adjacent teeth of a diagnostic cast will determine the exact method of characterization. 2.18.2. With a sharp pencil, trace out the ridge and point angles (Figure 2.29-G) and m ake a final check of the facial contour. Use a small diam ond poi nt or diam ond wheel to m ake the developmental grooves. Scribe a fine groove. T hen, if necessary, widen and deepen it by gently  moving the diamond from side to side (Figure 2.29-H). 2.18.3. Observe how num erous small transverse lines m ay sometimes cover the facial surface of teeth. The s urface m ay vary greatly from having deep irregular groo ves to appearing alm ost smooth. Use a sm all diam ond ball to create th ese striation s (Figure 2. 29-I). Fin er lines can b e drawn across the surface as shown in Figure 2.29-J. 2.18.4. Note that the patient’s tissue will often recede, exposing the cervix of the tooth. Reproduce this cervix on the veneer’s su rface or the crow n will look too l ong. Overcontour in the cervical area can als o lead to ch ronic gingivitis. Use a  small round diam ond to sim ulate the cervix of th e crown (Figure 2.29-K). Your goal in this critical area is  to reproduce the origin al contours or to match the adjacen t teeth. Lightly to uch and polish  all high spots with a rubber wheel to sim ulate natural wear in the mouth. 2.19.  Establishing  Occlusal  Surfaces. I t is d ifficult to e stablish o cclusal contact in  porce lain a s successfully as with metal. The optimum type of occlusion for a porcelain occlusal is mutually protected occlusion because the forces of mastication are mostly vertical. Also, when possible, cusp-to-fossa tooth orientations are preferred. 2.19.1. Contacts. Avoid contact on m arginal ridges where  porcelain is ea sily fractured. Do not widen occlusal tables or leave sharp edges on porcelain cusps because breakage is more likely. 2.19.2.  Redefine  Occlusal  Anatomy. Grinding  posterior o cclusal  surfaces requ ires great skill. The objective is to   highlight detailed anatom y m ade whe n the porcelain was first applied, not create it. The grinding stones and diam onds should,  therefore, be used w ith a very light action. Some suggested finishing device s and their uses can be seen in Figure 2.30. Fissures should be finished with points, and suppl emental grooves and fossae with sm all round diamonds. Be sure to remove all porcelain th at overlaps  the m etal b efore glazing. During final polishing, any fired porcelain left on the metal will be very hard to remove. 2.20. Shaping FPDs. As the number of units increases, so does the level of difficulty. Finishing an FPD will require more tim e and patienc e. Before you actually sta rt, think about and  plan your approach to contouring each resto ration. It m ay be helpful to sc ribe a pencil lin e showing the boundaries of each individual unit. 2.20.1. The initial steps of seating th e restoration are the same as  for a single unit. A djusting the contact areas will be easier if you can remove one of the adjacent teeth or ridge area from the cast.

One of the m ore difficult steps involves shap ing the interproxim als. During the porcelain application step, m any ceram ists cut through th e porcelain to the opaque, separating the teeth. When the restoration is processed, the porcelain shrinks away from these areas. The task now is to remove all sharp edges by light grinding with a  diamond-coated disc and then later addingporcelain to the interproxi mal areas and refiring the restoration.  But first, its best to shape the rall contour and prevent needless repeated remaining bulk of porcelain to establish the oveporcelain additions. Then, lightly air-abrade and clean th e restoratio n in an ultrasonic before adding porc elain in th e interp roximals and ot her deficient areas.  NOTE: Ensure interp roximal spaces are precisely positioned and contoured to allow only minimal finishing. 2.20.3. Separation betw een the units m ust be  finely  divided and deep enough so the teeth will is division should appear V-shappear natural (Figure 2.31). Thaped and not like a groove separating the individual units. It takes p atience to  shape teet h to look natural and not like “cutouts” bonded to a metal backing. Use a diamond-coated ultra-thin separating disc to divide the units. Exercise care not to grind through the po rcelain, exposing the opa que layer or underlying metal.  Figure 2.31. Separation Between Units of Anterior FPDs.  2.21. Second or Corrective Dentin-Enamel Firing. To add porcelain, first rem ove the glaze and clean the restoration. Then apply the sam e porcelain powders  originally used during th e initial app lication to make the addition. Be sure to  add enough porcelain to allow for r econtouring. Process the porcelain addition under vacuum and at a slightly lower temperature.  156  2.22. Repairing Porcelain (Low-Fusing, Air-Fired):  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 e is preferred. Repair porcelain fusing temperatu res are er porcelains. Consequently, they are som etimes 2.22.1. Another way to correct post-co mpletion contour or repair porc elain veneers is with repair porcelain (f or exam ple, correction powder). Thes e porcelains will bond to glazed or unglazed surfaces, b ut, an unglazed surfacconsiderably below that of the standard venemixed with standard powders to lower the fusing temperature of the mix.  2.22.2. Uses for repair porcelain incl ude filling imperfections such  as bubbles or cracks, adding onto the occlusal where it does  not contact the opposing bite prope rly, adding to interproximal contact areas, adding to pontic s th at are sho rt of contactin g  the tis sue, and  correcting crown contour near the gingiva. These additions can be  carried out at the g laze step withou t risking the vacuum cycle and possibly causing the veneer porcelain to bubble.  2.22.3. While some repair porcelains such as Ceramco® 1600 Add-On Porcelain are supplied in as many shades as standard porcelain s, others are designed to be m ixed with the regu lar dentine and enamel powders. Becau se m aterials are widely  diffe rent and repair situations vary , consult th e manufacturer’s directions when using repair porcelains.  Section 2F—Staining 2.23. Shade Modification and Characterization. Extrinsic staining involves applying porcelain stains to the surface of a porcelain restoration and then  processing the stains,  usually during the glazing sequence. When the s tains are fired, they  actually  become part of the porce lain, covered  by  a th in, transparent glaze layer. Surface stai ns are h ighly pigmented objects th at absorb som e wavelengths of light and reflect others. As such, when they’re used in heavy concentrations , th ey tend to m ask the surface of the porcelain , reducing the translucency a nd vitality of the product. Th e stain s sho uld be mixed to a consistency that is neither too dry nor too we t. They should flow  on easily (evenly and smoothly), but stay in place and not  run. The surface on which the stains  are placed should be clean and dry and, of course, the glaze must be removed. Review Section 2B on color and shade. 2.23.1. Shade Alteration. Any changes in shade should be m inor and, if possible, limited only to corrections between adjacent shade tabs. It would be better to re make the veneer rather than m ake a major correction to the shade. 2.23.1.1. Surface Glaze. Apply a liquid glaze m edium to th e porcelain surface to sim ulate a glazed surface. The liquid medium will restore the surface luster and allow a good appraisal of  color. Do not use saliva or water for this purpose. Com pare the crow n and shade tab, using principles discussed in paragra ph 2.4. Evaluate the color of the restoration to determ ine where the change is needed—hue, chroma, or value. 2.23.1.2.  Chroma  Adjustments. T o increase the chrom a, sim ply add the stain of the sam e dominant h ue as the  c rown until the inten sity  is cor rect. To decreas e the chrom a, add the compliment of the dom inant hue. If the shade is  bright yellow, adding viol et will neutralize it. This also lo wers the va lue but,  hopefully, it will not be so drastic as to cause a m ismatch. NOTE: Usually, the processed porcelain veneer is  of higher value than required (depending on the cer amist’s ability to  apply porc elain). If  th e process ed porcela in v eneer a lways appears darker, it is because the porcelain is not being condensed properly. 2.23.1.3.  Hue  Adjustments. To change the hue of a re storation, re fer to the  c olor whee l (Figure 2.32-A). Only two hue m odifications are necessary because natural teeth are located in the yellow to orange range. To move a yellow hue to an orange hue, add a pink stain. (The stain AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  157 represented by red on the color wh eel is actually a pink.) T o change a orange  hue to yellow, add a yellow stain. 2.23.1.4. Value Adjustment: 2.23.1.4.1. Lowering the value can be done very eas ily by adding the com plementary color. If the dominant hue is orange, add blue. If  the dominant hue is yellow, add violet. Because most teeth have a yellow hue, the  violet stain is used m ore often, especially in th e incisal third. Adding violet to the inci sal area has the effect  of apparent translucency. If the crown being modified has a dominant hue of orange, use a blue stain instead.  2.23.1.4.2. Another very powerful modifier used to  lower value is brow n stain. Brown is a low value shade of red, orange, or yellow. A  small amount of brown a pplied to the surface will increase chroma and lower value.   Figure 2.32. Extrinsic Staining of Metal-Ceramic Crowns.  2.23.1.4.3. Raising the value of a rest oration is next to im possible. The only successful way to raise value is by adding a stain of higher value, which m ay change the hue, increase chroma, and also raise the value. Sometimes a small amount of white stain can increase the value, but it is not a go od choice of modifiers, because it is  very opaque. NOTE: If at any time, the actual hue of t he stain can be seen ra ther than the neutral gray desired, remove the stain with a tissue and repeat the procedure.  158  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.23.2.  Characterization  (Figures  2.32-B  through  -D). The desired effect of external characterization is sim ilar to th e placem ent of modifiers, the characterization can be seen  in d epth. The goal of every  ceramist is  to produce a restoration  so  natural  it  prevents  detection  when  seated  in  the  patient’s  mouth. Therefore, an y characterization should not be the focal point, but  it should blend into the entire com position with balance and harmony: internal m odifiers. However, with internal 2.23.2.1. Proximal Staining: 2.23.2.1.1. Every tooth will appear to have som e degree of proximal staining. The intensity and color of the staining may vary with the age and lifestyles of the patient. A young patient may have very little proxim al staining com pared to an older patient. Th e same comparison can be made between a coffee drinker and nondrinker.  2.23.2.1.2. To sim ulate proxim al stain, apply a m ixture of orange and brown stain that compliments the patient’s age and tooth color to this area, extending facially just beyond the contact area, but not co vering the facial surf ace itself (F igure 2.32-B). You can also apply this orange-brown mixture to the interprox imal connector areas of an FPD to enhance the apparent separation of the units. Be sure to re move any excess stain fro m the facial surface. For a fairly young patient, use a gray m ixture  instead. For the m ost part, the m esial and distal surfaces of a FPD unit should be treated the same way as an individual crown. 2.23.2.2.  Cervical  Staining. The cervical areas  of a too th  reflect the pink coloration of the gingiva and may also be stained.  This effect may vary from a light pinkish-orange color to an orange-brown color.  Cervical stainin g is p resent on m ost shade guid e tabs and  will h ave a  bearing on the overall shade of the restoration. Ce rvical staining is often used to simulate the root portion of a tooth. This is especially true  of periodontally involved teeth and exceptionally long pontic. To rem edy the problem, an orange-brown mixture its applied  to the prepared area to accentuate the cem entoenamel junction and  make the restoration look shorter (Figure 2.32-C). 2.23.2.3. Enamel Cracks:  2.23.2.3.1. The enamel crack is hard to sim ulate with surface stains. T o give an appearance of depth, the enam el crack simulation should have both a  highlight and a shadow. This can be done by applying a mixture of white and yellow stain (4 to 1 ratio) in a thin line.  2.23.2.3.2. The excess stain is rem oved by a method called painting off (Figure 2.33). Use a clean brush to narrow the width  of the line and to apply a second  gray stain line distally to the first, simulating the shadow. Narrow this second line until just a hint of shadow rem ains. The combination of these two should give the illusion of a fracture (Figure 2.28-A).   Figure 2.33. Painting-Off Technique.   AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  159 2.23.2.3.3. Som etimes the enam el crack lines beco me discolored with food, tobacco, or other stains. If this happens, replace the white-yellow mixture with one of orange-brown and apply with a sm all a mount of orange stain alo ng either s ide of the f irst line to c reate the shadow. 2.23.2.4. Hypocalcifications. These areas result from  the removal of calcium from the enamel and appear as white blotches or even white lines (Figure 2.28-D). To  create this effect, use white stain mixed with liquid medium to a fairly heavy consistency. Although this stain is quite opaque, it is sometimes difficult to apply in the opacity desired. If the stain applied is too thick it will actually create lu mps on the surface. The  desired effect shou ld appear m uch the sam e after firing as it does when the stain is applied. 2.23.2.5.  Resin  Restorations  (Figure  2.27-I). Som etimes it is n ecessary to p lace a m etal-ceramic crown in the mouth of a patient who has m any anterior composite restorations. A flawless restoration would look out of place in such an environment. To simulate a resin filling, the proper color of an orange-b rown mixture (also white, if need ed) is selected and applied to the desired area. Then, the first app lication is o utlined with  a slight bit of  brown stain. Th e outline should be narrowed to a thin marginal line. 2.23.2.6. Anatomy. The occlusal anatom y of posterior  teeth and lingual anatom y of anteriors should also  show degrees of characterizatiomonotony of the basic shade. The concern, however, is to avoid the overuse of stains. Different ratios of orange and brown are used, depending on the anatomy. A darker stain would normally be applied to a defect (such as a pit) rather than to a groove or fissure. On occlusal surfaces, the stain is randomly applied with a fine-tipped brush (Figure 2 .32-D). The lines should appear as  mere suggestions of grooves, rather than being  heavily accented. Marginal ridges can be m ade to seem  m ore translucent by adding violet st ain. Cusp tips are highlig hted with white  sta in. Lingual anatomy may also be accentuated in much the same way. n to define surface detail and break up the  Section 2G—Glazing 2.24. Overview. Glazed porcelain surfaces have been described as being impervious to mouth fluids and biologically compatible with oral tissues. The glaze itself is a for mation of a thin transparent g lass. The amount of glaze on the surface determ ines its appearance. A low glaze appears as a slight sheen with no  loss of surface detail. A medium glaze appears with some rounding of fine detail. A  high glaze appears glossy (high ly reflective, sm ooth) with a greater loss of surface detail and for m. A m edium glaze is  usually pref erred for its beauty  and long-lasting quality. Also, in surface detail may become filled with saliva and, therefore, go unnoticed. 2.25. Autogenous Method: the patient’s mouth, some of the 2.25.1. This m ethod is usually done in conjunction w ith extrinsic staining and is preferred by many for its durability, sim plicity, and beau ty. After the resto ration is proces sed, the s tains become a part of the thin transparent glass that covers the restoration.  2.25.2. Two factors that are used to cont rol the for mation of the glass are  time and  temperature. Either variable can be increased or decreased to obtain the desired amount of glaze. For example, a crown sintered to 920  oC may require holding at that tem perature for a period of 2 or 3 m inutes. The same crown fired to 940  oC may only require holding 1 or 2 m inutes. It is always easier and safer to increase the holding time than to incr ease the temperature. You might accidentally cause the porcelain to coalesce or devi trify. If the porcelain co alesces, it will need to be recontoured. If the porcelain devitrifies, it may not glaze, in which case you must start over. 160  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.25.3. After the extrins ic staining is com plete, place  the restoration on a firing tray and th en on the firing table to dry. Set the firing tem perature at th e lowest en d  of the manufacturer’s  recommendation or 20  oC below the last know n firing temperat ure for that restoration. A typical setting would be 920  oC for 2 to 3 m inutes. Air-fire the rest oration, using the proper tim e and temperature controls. R emove the restoration and  visually inspect the g laze. If the resto ration is underfired, immediately replace it in the furnace and raise  the temperature another 10  oC and hold the restoration at that tem perature for 30 seconds to 1 m inute. W hen you observe the desired amount of glaze, remove the restoration immediately and let it completely cool. 2.26. Overglaze Method: 2.26.1. Some uses of this technique  are to reglaze denture teeth,  facings, or prefabricated pontics  after they have been adjusted ; reglaze a ceram ic restoration that has been adjusted ; and ensure a glazed surface covers a ceram ic restoration that m ay have been difficult to glaze. An autogenou s glaze is superior to an overglaze so avoid the routine use of an overglaze. 2.26.2. Mix the overglaze powder with the liquid medium until it will string from the spatula when lifted from the mix. Apply the m ixture in one di rection, using a s mall brush. Keep the m ix even and remove any excess or puddling.  Dry the ov erglaze in front of an open furnace as if it were a stain. Correctly applied glaze m aterial will appear as an even white layer after dry ing. Air fire the restoration to a tem perature of approximately 860  oC. Immediately remove the restoration and let  cool.  Section 2H—Soldering 2.27.  Presolder.  This technique joins the units of a m etal-ceramic FPD before porcelain is applied  (Figure 2.34). Presoldering metal-ceramic units requires a solder with a m uch higher fusion temperature (about 1090  oC) than Type III gold  solders. Th e solder jo int must be able to with stand the po rcelain firing tem peratures. Be  sure the p resolder yo u are using  is m atched to the ceramic alloy  in its composition and color. 2.27.1. Preparing the Units:  2.27.1.1. The principles and theories of presoldering differ som ewhat from  those used for conventional soldering. The strongest presolder joints are those that have been prepared so they need the least am ount of solder. Trying to bridge  a large gap, especially if the presolder has been overheated, will result in a weak joint. The proper am ount of solder gap width for presoldering is 0.1  mm. The area o f the sold er joint m ust also be rubbered sm ooth before making the matrix.  2.27.1.2. One m ethod of separating the units of a  FPD is to m ake a diagonal cut through the pontic. The cut can be made with a separating disc through the casting or by making a diagonal cut with a warm razor blade through the wax pontic (Figure 2.34-A). This way, the solder joint will be long and thin, resulting in a much stronge r joint. Ideally, the con nectors should be cast metal (for strength) so they are not as good a location for a presolder joint. 2.27.2. Soldering Matrix. Seat the units on the  cast and se cure them with sticky wax. Join the units together with a high quality fast-setting material such as Dura Lay® or Zapit® (Figure 2.34-B). Once the material has set and the units are removed from the cast, check the tis sue side of the joint for voids. Fill any voids with more material. 2.27.3. Investing the Assembly: 2.27.3.1. Use a special high-heat solder investm ent or phosphate-bonded casting investm ent. If AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  161 casting investm ent is used, m ix with  distilled  water  instead of  the specia l liquid to lim it expansion to an absolute m inimum. Mix the i nvestment thick; a thin  m ix can weaken the  investment, causing it to crack at high temperatures.  2.27.3.2. Place the m ix inside each retainer, usin g a bladed instrum ent (Figure 2.34-C). Next, place a patty of the m ix on a paper towel and in vert the assembly onto the patty (Figure 2.34-D). The towel absorbs moisture, w hich helps to  control slum ping. Make sure the m argins are covered and the m etal is supported. However,  do not bury the castings because it w ould make soldering more difficult because of poor heat transfer to the castings.  e investm ent mound with as much m etal 2.27.3.3. The assem bly should rest gently on thexposed as possible so the heat can be applied qui ckly and evenly wi thout overheating the assembly. Let the investm ent bench set for at least 45 m inutes and then trim  the i nvestment base to these dimensions: 10 to 15 mm thick, and 3 mm beyond the castings (Figure 2.34-E). 2.27.4.  Preheating  the  Assembly. Burn off t he  Dura  Lay® or  Zapit® and preh eat the so lder assembly before applying the soldering flame. One burnout method suggests placing the assembly in a cold furnace, raising the temperature to 1300 oF, and then letting it heat soak for about 5 to 10 minutes. 2.27.5. Soldering the Units:  2.27.5.1. Us e a gas-oxygen torch with a special soldering tip to m elt the solder. Adjust the oxygen pressure to 6 pounds and set the gas pre ssure between 6 and 8 pounds. Light the torch and check the fla me. Adjust the flame until the inner cone is about 15 mm long. If the torch is adjusted right, there should be little or no hissing.  2.27.5.2. Remove the assem bly from the oven and pl ace it on a tripod. Imm ediately direct the flame around the base of the investm ent to raise  the temperature. Then di rect the flam e to the castings until they show a slight orange color.  Holding the torch in one hand and the presolder in the other, place the end of the strip onto the joint. Now, as you direct the flame onto the joint area, the solder will melt and flow down into the joint (Figure 2.34-F).  2.27.5.3. Remove the solder strip, but keep a brush flam e on the assem bly. Move the flam e to the reverse side of the assem bly and draw the so lder through the joint. So lder will always flow to the hottest areas.  2.27.5.4. Let the investm ent bench cool com pletely before you rem ove the castings (Figure 2.34-G). On multiple units, never solder more than two joints at a time. 2.28. Postsolder Technique. This technique involves furnace soldering metal-ceramic restorations that have already had porcelain applied  to them (Figur e 2.35). Occasionally, a Type III gold alloy  retainer must be soldered to th e rem aining part of  a  metal-ceramic FPD. Another  use inc ludes splin ting two metal-ceramic crowns to strengthen weak abutment te eth. Finally, this technique  may be used to repair the metal part of a metal-ceramic restoration. 2.28.1. Preparing the Units: 2.28.1.1. Assembling the units is m uch the sam e as for Typ e III go ld alloy. Because you will use low-fusing solder, you can make the solder assembly with any solder investm ent. A solder gap width o f 0.250 mm between th e m etal surf aces is sugg ested, bu t the porcelain  veneers should be as close to each other as possible without contacting. 2.28.1.2. Lightly rubber all surfaces to be soldere d, seat the units on the abutm ent teeth, and flow wax into the p repared area. Use a steel  bur and sticky wax to  hold the units together. 162  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 Remove the solder relation and flow ivory wa x over any porcelain su rface that would contact investment (Figure 2.35-A). This will keep th e solder investm ent from contacting and fusing with the veneer (Figure 2.36).  Figure 2.34. Presolder Technique.  2.28.2. Investing the Assembly. Mix a sm all amount of solderi ng investment and construct the  assembly as described in paragraph 1.75.2.2. Carve a V-shaped notch on th e lingual to ensure adequate access to the s older joint. Flush out th e wax with boiling wate r. Place the invested units on the firing table of a porcelain furnace to warm  slowly for 10 minutes. Then move closer to the muffle and warm it for 5 more minutes.    AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 2.35. Postsolder Technique. 163   Figure 2.36. Investing a Metal-Ceramic Restoration (Cross-Section).  2.28.3. Soldering the Units:  2.28.3.1. Hold a strip of low-fusing solder over a bunsen burner until a sm all ball of solder forms (Figure 2.35-B). Cut off the ball of solder , leaving a sm all tail long enough to touch the investment patty. Apply flux to the solder joint. Apply antiflux to th e occlus al surface to  confine the solder flow.  Position the ball of solder with the tail extending down (Figure 2.35  -C).  164  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.28.3.2. Place the assembly in the furnace and star t the vacuum pump to reduce the amount of oxide that would normally form in the solder joint. (A porcelain furnace with a viewing glass is best because you can watch the solder melt.)  oC (slightly above the fusing tem perature of the s older) and 2.28.3.3. Set the furnace to 870 wait for the solder to melt. The  actual temperature the solder flows may vary with the so lder used. Start to check for solder flow  when the o ven temperature reaches 815  oC. Release the vacuum and rem ove the assem bly as soon as th e solder wets the join t (Figure 2.35-D). If the solder is overheated, you’ll ha ve porosity and an em brittled  joint. The solder joint should extend far enough gingivally to recontour and still maintain adequate strength. 2.28.4.  Repairing  Exposed  Metal  Surfaces. After the porcelain has been applied, m ake a ny metal repairs by the postsolder technique,  using the rules for low-fusing alloys.  Furnace soldering is preferred over torch soldering for this purpose because it is more controlled and does not subject the porcelain to drastically chang ing tem peratures. Rem ember to position the res toration in th e solder investment to take full advantage of solder flow. This would be the case in soldering a hole or contact area.  Section 2I—Resin-Bonded FPDs (Maryland Bridge) 2.29.  Design  Factors. The two prim ary considerations are to es tablish a distinct path of insertion to allow for proper seating and resistance to dislodgment and to m aximize th e bonding surface of the retainers for strength and retention. The design of the retainers consists of four parts: 2.29.1. Proximal Segment. The dentist prepares the abutment teeth by removing enamel from the proximal suprabulge an d undercu t areas to incr ease the b onding surf ace. This enam el shaping extends just past the p roximal line angle, allowing the retainer to grasp the abutm ent and provide bracing for the framework (Figure 2.37). The proximal wrap limits facial-lingual movement of the retainer during function. The dentist m ay also  cut sm all subtle  groo ves in the interprox imal parallel to the path of insertion to resist displacement.  Figure 2.37. Resin-Bonded FPD Design.   AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  165 2.29.2. Lingual Segment. The design goal in the lingual segm ent is to create as large a bonding surface as p ossible without creating periodontal probl ems, excursion p roblems, or plaque traps. Therefore, it is necessary that the fram ework ends 1 mm away from the gingival tissue and has a knife-edge finish. The m etal thickness of the  framework should range  from 0.3 mm  to 0.6 mm. The minimum thickness passing over a m arginal ridge is 0.6 mm. This thickness increases with  the transition into the connector areas. 2.29.3.  Occlusal  Rests. Preparations for occlusal rest seats for resin-bonde d retainers are shallower, narrower, and have stra ighter “locking” walls than occl usal rest seats fo r RPDs. Rest seats are usually about 1.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter and 1.0 mm in depth. 2.29.4. Seating Stops. The design m ay include incisal seating  tabs to provide positive orientation of the restoration during cementation or to stabilize mobile teeth (Figure 2.38). These stops greatly enhance positive seating during the short tim e period available for bond ing. Afterward, th e tabs are cu t off and sm oothed. Many d entists ob ject to  the tabs becaus e, in som e in stances, the y interfere with making occlusal adjustments. An alternative method involves the use of di mples or delicate horizontal slots prepared in the lingual enamel of anterior teeth.  Figure 2.38. Seating Stops for Resin-Bonded FPDs.   2.30.  Framework  Fabrication. T here are two m ethods of produc ing fram eworks for resin-bonded FPDs. The first involves the use of a refractory cast, where the pattern is waxed directly to the refractory cast, sprued and invested, and cast to the refractory cast. In the s econd method, the pattern is waxed directly on the m aster cast, sprued, pulled off the m aster cast, invested, and then cast into metal. These two methods are as follows: 2.30.1. Refractory Cast Method. A refractory cast can be made in the following two ways: (1) by initially pouring the im pression in stone and  repouring it a second tim e in refractory m aterial, or (2) by duplicating m aster casts and pouring a refract ory cast. The first way requires less m aterial and is less time consuming. 2.30.1.1. Mixing and Pouring the Refractory Material. Mix and pour the refractory m aterial into the impression in the usual manner. Adhere to the m anufacturer’s recommended liquid to powder ratios and m ix under vacuum for 60 to 90 seconds. Mechanically spatulate the mix 166  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 under vacuum for 60 to 90 seconds. Pour only th e involved portion of the im pression and a tooth to either side. Let bench set fo r 45 m inutes before removing the cast.  NOTE: Full-arch refractory casts are required only when the refractory casts are articulated. 2.30.1.2.  Surveying  the  Cast. Routinely survey refracto ry casts  to establish the height of contour on abutm ent teeth. This  indicates undercut  areas and discourages overwaxing of the pattern and late r corrections to  seat the fram ework on the m aster cast. Do not block out these undercut areas, even w hen duplicating casts. To  do so would elim inate proxim al contours needed to pr operly shape the ging ival half of the patte rn. Outline the ex tent of the f ramework with a wax pencil. 2.30.1.3. Waxing the Pattern. Follow the design factors given in paragraph 2.29 when waxing frameworks for resin-bonded FPDs. The dim ensions given are for the fi nished casting. The  pattern thickness may be increased slightly to allow for finishing. 2.30.1.3.1. Mount the m aster casts on an articulat or in the prescrib ed m anner. Wax the  pontic substructure on the  master  cast  or m odify a preform ed plastic substructure pontic form to fit the edentulous space. Ensure adequate space is allowed for porcelain cov erage of the pontic. By beginning the wax-up on the m aster cast, you are able to check the occlusion without having to articulate threfractory cast for pattern completion. 2.30.1.3.2. Attach the pontic to the refractory and  flow a uniform layer of wax over all areas within the design. Keep in m ind the m inimum thickness of m etal needed for strength and add about a tenth of a millim eter thickness for finishing. Sm ooth the pattern and prepare to invest. e refractory cast. The pontic is later transferred to the 2.30.1.4.  Trimming  the  Refractory  Cast. Trim the base of  the cast p rior to inv estment in order to fit the appropriate size casting ring. Leav e an investment base at least 10 mm thick for strength. After the investm ent is set, any portio n of the base sticking out from  the ring can be removed. The pattern is now ready for spruing and investing. 2.30.1.5. Spruing and Investing the Pattern. Attach a sprue for mer to the wax pattern and apply a wetting agent. L ine the casting ring with a th ick layer of petrolat um; use no other ring liner. Use distilled wate r instead of the special liquid and vacuum spatulate the m ix as before. The reason for these modifications is to restrict expansion and thereby reduce the possibility of mold separation and casting fins. Let the inveinutes. Proceed to burnout and casting (paragraphs 2.9 and 2.10). sted ring bench set for at least 60 m2.30.2. Pulled Pattern Method (Figure 2.39): 2.30.2.1. Articulate the m aster cast.  Use a wax pencil to m ark the margin outline on the cast (Figure 2.39-A). Apply a resin to stone separator to the cast. 2.30.2.2. Using a pattern resin build up the wing and  proximal portions of the retainers (Figure 2.39-B). Pattern resin is used to minimize pattern distortion. Do not extend the resin beyond the margin outline and m aintain an even thickness. After the resin has cure d carefully remove the resin wings, cutback any m argin overextensi ons, and reduce thick areas (Figure 2.39-C). Replace the completed wings on the cast. 2.30.2.3. Slowly add resin from  the prox imal of  each retainer towards the opposite retain er. Allow the resin to cure  before contact is m ade between the  two retaine rs. This m inimizes the amount of distortion between the resin retainers  and the abutm ents. An  alternate method is to use a p lastic sprue cu t to fit be tween the reta iners without applying pressure to th e retainers. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  tic sprue and let the resin cu167 Connect one side of the plasremaining s pace between the retain ers and  the plas tic sprue then  le t the resin  cu re (F igure  2.39-E).

NOTE: Base m etal alloys, nickel-chrom e or chrom e-cobalt, are generally used for the resin-bonded te chnique. As such, m eticulous handling of these alloys must be observed each step of the way for successful porcelain bonding. It is important that no more than 25 to 30 percent recast alloy be used with this technique. 2.30.5.  Finishing.

There are difficulties as sociated with applying po rcelain to  this style framework (Figure 2.39-J through -M). The  distinct path of insertion can make removing the raw porcelain buildup difficult. If a section of  the mass breaks away, hopefully it can hopefully be replaced or fresh porcelain added with the framework off the cast. Also, support of the fram ework during firing procedures must be aided by using metal or ceramic posts with grooves in them. The proximal wrap causes th e pontic to be slightly wider than the edentulo us space, and shaping the  pontic can be an esthetic compromise without showing opaque or metal.

Overview. The high increase in the value of gold, be ginning in the late 1960s, has been the m ain force behind the development of gold substitute alloys for dental casting uses. The greatest development has been toward base metal alloys, commonly called nonprecious alloys, which contain no noble metals. The most popular of these have been the nickel-chromium alloy systems. These alloys are not new. Like many other m aterials used in dentistry, they were initially developed for pur poses outside the dental profession. Nickel-chromium (NiChrome™) has been used in industr y for many years as heater wire or conductive rod material in the m anufacture of heating elem ents. Nickel-chromium alloys were selected for fixed restoration casting primarily because of their high heat characteristics.  3.2. Prosthodontic Uses. The m ost popular current use of the  nonprecious nickel-chromium alloys in fixed prosthodontics is the casting of substructures or copings for m etal-ceramic restorations. An advantage o f the bas e m etal alloy  in this  app lication i s it s hi gh s ag or  di stortion r esistance a t t he temperatures needed for the firing of the veneer pormelting tem peratures of  the base m etal alloy over  gold-based alloys designed for com parable use. Because the base metal alloys equal or exceed the m echanical properties of gold in m any respects, base metal alloys have been used in all cast metal fixed restorations, with and without porcelain.  3.3. Alloy Composition. Practically all of the current nonprecious  alloys for fixed prosthodontic uses are nickel-chromium systems. Composition ranges for the many brands availab le are approximately 67 to 81 percent nickel and 2 to 20 percent chromium . Other elem ents such as m olybdenum, manganese, aluminum, silicon, and beryllium  are added in sm all quantities ranging from  approximately 0.1 to 5.2 percent. The trace am ounts of these elem ents control cast m etal grain size, fusion and melting temperatures, hardness, and tensile strength; and they  impart other needed char acteristics to the alloy  depending on its intended use. As a  general rule, those additions to th e alloy that provide lower melting temperatures usually produce higher  hardness and, therefore, restorati ons that are m ore diffi cult to finish. Higher melting alloys are generally less hard and less difficult to finish. 3.4. Possible Hazards: celain. This is attributed to the higher fusion and 3.4.1. The element nickel may be one of the most common causes of allergic dermatitis. It may be responsible for m ore allergic reactions than all other m etals com bined. Laboratory technician s who have been shown to be nick el sensitive by m edically valid  evidence should be advised of some potential risk with long-term exposure.  3.4.2. Some base metal alloys contain the elem ent beryllium to control hardness of the cast alloy and reduce the fusion temperature. Inhalation of beryllium-containing dust particles is known to be a potential health h azard. Industrial safety pre cautions must be observed  and adequate ventilation provided when grinding and finishing beryllium-containing alloys.  3.5. Technique Differences:  3.5.1. The well-established laborator y techniques developed over m any years of prem ium gold alloy use cannot be directly applied to the base metal alloys. This is because base metal alloys, due to their chromium content, have high melting temperatures which usually range between 2000 and 2600 oF. Such a heat range is beyond the capability of a conventional gas-air torch. Instead, a gas-oxygen torch with m ultiorifice tip is required to m elt base metal  alloys. The use of  acetylene as a  fuel should be avoided because the flame produced from such a source can become too hot. Also, 170  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 ments must be used. Even these high heat hrinkage, burnout tem peratures of 1500 to 1600 an oxyacetylene flame is rather dirty. When using a gas-oxygen torch, the ga s pressure should be  between 6 and 8 pounds while the oxygen pressure should be adjusted to 20 pounds.  3.5.2. Base m etal alloys are suscep tible to oxidation of their co mponent m etals and to carbon inclusion in the m olten state. For th is reason induction casting is preferre d for base m etal alloy casting and produces the most consistent results. 3.5.3. Due to their h igh m elting temperatures,  base  m etal alloys und ergo greater shrinkage or contraction than go ld alloy s wh en cooling  f rom the liqu id (m olten) to  the solid state. Consequently, more expansion of the m old is ne cessary to p roduce a cas ting of sufficient size to  fit the die without considerable grinding on the inte rnal surfaces of the casting. To compensate for  oF are the unusually large amount of srecommended. Because gypsum-bonded casting investments cannot be u sed for such temperature levels, either phosphate or silicate bonded investinvestments show considerab le su rface breakd own when contacted b y over-heated m etal, a common occurrence with torch-melted alloy. 3.5.4. In addition to casting shrinkag e compensation, the high casting ring temperature is required to m aintain the m olten or liquid  s tate of  the  ni ckel-chromium alloy for as lon g as pos sible. Because base metal alloys have only half the density (approximately 9 grams per cubic centimeter [g/cc]) of their gold cou nterparts, more time is  required for the m olten metal to f ill the ca sting investment mold cavity by centrifuga l force of the casting m achine. The speed  of the cen trifugal arm of the casting m achine m ust be s ignificantly increased to provide the c entrifugal forc e required for base metal casting. The lower density of these alloys also requires special spruing and venting techniques for wax patterns to consistently produce complete castings. 3.5.5. Basic research in labo ratory techniques f or fixed restor ative construction with base m etal alloys has shown that m anufacturer’s instructions for handling of  investments are not adequate to produce castings large enough to fit the die. Therefore, m odification of the m anufacturer’s instructions are often ne cessary to establish rout ine laboratory procedures for the production of clinically acceptab le res torations. O nce establis hed, such procedures must be closely followed, otherwise th e technique  sensitivity of  the base  metal allo ys will resu lt in a prod uct less th an satisfactory for clinical use. Rem akes of unaccepta ble restorations quickly offset any potential savings in alloy cost. 3.5.6. Soldering of base m etals is  also very technique sensitive.  The thick oxides that form  when soldering can affect or weaken  the chemical bond of the porcelain.  Therefore, ill fitting FPDs are usually remade rather than soldered. 3.6.  Pattern  Spruing. Due to the low density offollowing special attention:  base m etal  alloys, wax pattern spruing requires the 3.6.1.  Direct  Spruing  of  Individual  and  Multiple  Unit  Patterns. Use 8-gauge round wax or plastic for pattern sprue for mers. Preformed sprue formers with spherical reservoirs are preferred.

Line the casting ring with 0.040-inch thick KAOLINER ®, which is a trade na me for a mat of finely spun fibers of kaolin used as an inve stment ring liner. It allows m aximum expansion of the investment mix while setting and during burnout . Asbestos is generally not resilient enough to  allow the expansion needed for base m etal alloys. One 0.040-inch thick strip of KAOLINE R is equivalent to a double layer of asbestos and does not pose the respiratory health problem  of asbestos. 3.7.2. The high heat investm ent of c hoice for cas ting base m etal alloys is the phosphate-bonded type. It produces sm oother surface castings th an the silicate-bonded type. Phosphate-bonded investment is supplied as a powder-liquid system.  The liquid portion of the system  is a colloidal silicate that can be diluted with water to provide various am ounts of investment expansion.

On completion of burnout, the investment should appear white. Dark areas of investment indicate not all the carbon residue has been eliminated. 3.8. Casting: 3.8.1. Manual Casting. Manual casting of base metal alloys, using a gas-oxygen torch and broken arm casting  m achine, is sim ilar to  casting other m etal-ceramic allo ys.

Load the ring when the ingots begin to slump; oxides will not allow the alloy to pool as precious metals do. Molten alloy  under the oxide layer  will begin to roll and m ove under the pressure of the flam e. Shake the crucible ca rriage with tongs as you slide it forward. W hen ingots collapse, cast them immediately. 3.8.2. Induction Casting. Induction casting of base m etal fixed restorations can be done by using casting machines such as the Ticonium  Modular 3.  Operating instructions for this machine are as follows: 3.8.2.1. Preparing the Machine:  balance the casting arm for the ring size being 3.8.2.1.1. First, choose and place the crucib le fo r the allo y being used. Carbon crucib les should not be used for base metal alloys because the carbon contam inates alloys containing nickel or palladium. Ceramic crucibles are predominantly used for base alloys, but they can be used for all alloys. Select a cradle and used. Turn the circuit breaker on and rotate the power switch from 0 to 1 to turn machine on. The white pilot light should now be on.  3.8.2.1.2. Raise the coil around crucible by rotating the casting arm until crucible is over the coil. With your left hand, push  the crucible carrier back to the center crucible over the coil. Place the fingers of your righ t hand under the b lack handle and lift while pushing the silv er lever to the lef t with yo ur thumb. Ensure the  reference pin aligns wi th the hole beneath it and release the silver lever to lock the coil in the up position.  3.8.2.1.3. Remove any slag from previous castings and adjust the crucible so the spout aligns with the sprue hole in mold. 3.8.2.2. Premelting the Alloy (for Multiple Ingots). Load the alloy into the crucible by gently placing ingots into place usi ng tweezers. (Dropping them  may  break the crucible.) Close the  cover and turn the reset switch onto the proper  number to begin m elt. (A higher num ber will produce a faster m elt.) Turn the reset switch clockwise for a ceramcounterclockwise for a carbon crucible. To set the electronic eye during premelting: ic crucible and 3.8.2.2.1. Using appropriate eye protection, observe the alloy as it m elts. Use visual indicators to dete rmine corr ect casting s etting.

Just prior to reaching casting temperature, open the cover and place th e mold into  the cradle. When the am ber light glows, imm ediately push the silver lever to the left  with your left hand and push  the black handle down firm ly with your right hand. When the black handle reaches bottom, the arm will begin to spin automatically. Allow the arm to spin for 10 to 15 seconds before pushing  the red stop button. The lid will not open until the arm stops completely. NOTE: Ticonium also m akes a flask support that adapts the Ticom atic for casting FPD castings. T he only other adjustm ent that must be made is to set the relay range knob for the metal being cast. 3.9.  Finishing  Base  Metal  Castings. Due to their superior physical and m echanical properties, base metal castings are more difficult to grind than their  softer, gold-based counterparts. There is a tendency AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  to overwax the patterns for gold castings because it casting. easier to rem ove the excess b ulk in the f inished 173 3.9.1. Make sure the patterns for casting base metal  alloys are highly ref ined and as close to the final form as possible. Keep overwaxing of m argins to a minim um. Remove bulk such as sprue cutoff on hi gh-speed equipment (such as a high-speed  lathe), using conventional abrasive disks. Abrasives like TiCor ® and TiHi ®, used to polish RPD fra meworks, are good polishing agents for base metal fixed restorations also. 3.9.2.

Overview:  4.1.1. Changing tim es and patient needs have brought a bout viable alternatives  to the traditional metal-ceramic system. Today’s patients are m ore health and esthetic con scious. To answer thos e needs, all-ceramic systems have com e on the m arket that offer excellent al ternatives to porcelain fused to metal.  4.1.2. The prim ary advantage of all-ceram ic restor ations is im proved  esthetics. Metal-ceram ic restorations do not transm it light through the meta l substructure. Light transm ission through an all-ceramic restoration more closely resem bles nature and, therefore, g reatly enhances esthetics. The elimination of the m etal collar and darkened  subgingival areas are also an advantage to the all-ceramic restoration.  4.1.3. In addition to esthetic benefits, all-ceramic restorations m ay exhibit im proved biocompatibility over traditiona l m etal-ceramic  restorations. Abrasion resistance with som e systems is more sim ilar to natural teeth, thereby m inimizing wear of opposing dentition. Ceram ic materials ar e m ore compatible  with ora l tiss ue than  m etal, p reventing corro sion and tissu e reaction.  4.1.4. All-ceramic restoration system s can be used  for crowns, inlays, onlays, and veneers. Also, with new materials on the m arket today, som e m etal-free FPDs can be m ade if  the techn ician practices strict adherence to the m anufacturer’s guidelines. Two of the  more popular all-ceram ic systems, In-Ceram ® by Vident and IPS Em press® by Ivoclar North Am erica, are discussed in Sections 4B and 4C, respectively. 4.2. Preparation Requirements:  strict adherence to 4.2.1. All-ceram ic restorations require m ore e xtensive tooth reduction and dimensional guidelines. Stress distribution is of great concern when designing the all-ceram ic restoration. A correctly  designed preparation w ill provid e unifor m stress dis tribution without points of stress concentration, which m ight result  in fracture of the resultant restoration. The preparation should be smooth, nonwa vy, with no sharp angles or edge s. Even reduction of tooth structure is essential for success.  4.2.2. Crowns require a reduction of 1.5 mm on the ax ial walls and 1.5 to 2 mm on the occlusal or incisal surface. The margin is prepared as a 0.6 to 1.2 mm  shoulder with a rounded axial-shoulder line angle (Figure 4.1). Margins with  shoulders greater than 100- to  110-degree bevels or knife edge should be avoided. Veneers  should have a uniform reduction of 0.6 to 1 mm  with a chamfer  at the gingival m argin. More specific requirements can be f ound in  the manufacturer’s directions for the different types of all-ceramic systems.  Section 4B—In-Ceram® System 4.3. Overview. In-Ceram® is a registered trademark of VITA Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany, and distributed in North Am erica by Vident. In-Ceram ® Alum ina is a glass infiltrated alum inous oxide ceramic substructure on which VitaDur® Alpha porcelain is fired to complete the restoration.

To begin, complete a master cast with removable dies, using the techni ques described in Chapter 1, Section 1F.   Figure 4.1. Preparation Requirements for All-Ceramic Crowns. 175  4.4. Procedures. Once the master cast is completed, proceed as follows:  on the die with blockout wax and 4.4.1.  Die  Preparation.

Die Preparation for In-Ceram® Restoration.  4.4.2. Duplication. Duplicate the model with a highly ac curate impression material (Figure 4.3-A). Polyvinylsiloxane materials or addition polymerizing silicone are recommended. Because only the prepared site needs impressing, a sm all, disposable, quadrant impression tray is quite suitable. Use a putty and wash technique of heavy and light body im pression m aterials to create the  impression. Inspect the impression for margin integrity.   176  4.4.3. Special Plaster Model:  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 4.4.3.1. Spray the im pression with a wetting  agen t and  blow it dry. Strictly follow the manufacturer’s instructions for m ixing and pouring special pl aster.

Mixing Slip Material:  4.4.4.1. Weigh out exactly 38 gram s of VITA In-Ceram ®, Alumina Powder. Pour the contents of one ampoule of powder liquid and one drop of In-Ceram additive in the glass -mixing vessel and premix for a few seconds in the Vitasonic II (Figure 4.4-A).  4.4.4.2. Next, place the glass beaker on a vibrator and slowly mix in the alumina powder with a glass mixing rod. (This important step can seem tedious because the p article size of the slip is very fine and does not  wet eas ily with such  a  small amount of  liqu id.) In terrupt the m ixing process three times to place the mixing vessel in the Vitasonic II for 2 minutes each. Be sure to remove the glass rod before m ixing ultrasonically. Once the entire am ount of powder has been added, place the mix in the Vitasonic II for 7 additional minutes.  4.4.4.3. The finished mix should be homogenous. Place the prepared slip under vacuum for one minute (Figure 4.4-B) and the pour it from the glass mixing beaker into a plastic cup. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 4.4. Mixing and Applying Slip Material for In-Ceram® Restoration. 177  4.4.5. Slip Application:   4.4.5.1. Slip application is  accomplished with a #4 synthetic fi ber brush. The material needs to flow off the brush without locking into place (F igure 4.4-C). The moisture content is absorbed into the plaster and previous layers of m aterial, creating a dense rigid coping and substructure resembling wet chalk.  4.4.5.2. Although the finished substruc ture’s dim ensions should fo llow standard criteria, the slip material should be s lightly overbuilt and re duced after sintering is com plete. Copings and retainers must be at least 0.5 mm thick and connectors should be as large as possible.  4.4.5.3. Use a sharp flexible #15 scalpel for carving and shaping m argins (Figure 4.4-D). Carving the slip m aterial increases chances  of cracking the buildup. Therefore, adjustm ents should be accom plished after sinter ing when possible. Prior to si ntering, apply a layer of In-Ceram Stabilizer to the completed slip buildup after a waiting time of 30 minutes. 4.4.6. Sintering and Finishing:  4.4.6.1. The sintering process shrinks the special plaster model, leavi ng the slip m aterial accurately intact (Figure 4.5-A). The firing  program is approxim ately 10 hours lo ng—6 hours to reach 120 oC, 2 hours to reach 1120 oC, and a 2-hour hold. Cool the furnace to 400 oC before opening the firing cham ber. Then cool the substr ucture to room  temperature before handling. Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for more detailed guidance.  178  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 4.4.6.2. Remove the die spacer from  the master model and gently seat the substructure (Figure 4.5-B). Adjust fit and contours with a fine diamond rotating at low speed. The m inimum thickness is 0.5 mm on t he facial and lingual surfaces and 0.7 mm occlus ally. Proper contours and function m ust be established before glass infiltration because futu re adjustm ent is not possible.  Figure 4.5. Sintering and Finishing In-Ceram® Restoration.   4.4.7. Glass Infiltration: 4.4.7.1. Color match the infiltration  glass to specific Vita L umin® shades. Mix the appropriate porcelain with distilled water an d apply the m ixture to the outsi de of the restoration (Figure  4.6-A). Leave a portion of the pontic uncovered if fabricating an FPD. The infiltration glass must be absorbed into the slip m aterial like a sponge absorbing water from  a countertop. If the entire pontic is covered, an air pocket will be trapped in the center of the pontic, resulting in an area of slip material not infiltrated by the glass. This condition will compromise the strength of the FPD.   Figure 4.6. Glass Infiltration of an In-Ceram® Crown.   4.4.7.2. Place the unfired restoration on the special, pl atinum firing tray and fire it according to manufacturer’s directions. The firing progr am includes a 4 to 6 hour hold tim e at 1100  oC in order to allow the infiltration glass to be absorbed by the sintered slip material (Figure 4.6-B).  4.4.7.3. After firing, remove any excess infiltration glass with a coarse diam ond (Figure 4.6-C) and sandblast the rem aining glass with alum inum oxide. The substructure  must be refired and sandblasted again  to  ensure  no infiltration glass rem ains  on the surface. Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for details. 4.4.8.

In-Ceram® Restoration Porcelain Application.   Section 4C—IPS Empress® System 4.5. Overview. IPS Empress® is a leucite-reinforced glass ceram ic manufactured in ingots of different shades and opacities. The ceramic ingots are pressed into molds formed by using the lost wax technique. There are currently two different systems available—IPS Empress®, used for inlays, onlays, crowns, and veneers, and IPS Empress® 2, used for all of the above plus all-ceramic FPDs. The IPS Empress® system can be used with either  of the following methods of fabrication—the staining technique (paragraph 4.6) or the layering technique (paragraph 4.7). 4.6.  Staining  Technique. The crown or veneer is waxed to fuburned out in a conventional burnout oven. After burnout , the mold is transfe rred to the IPS Empress ® EP500 pressing furnace where a neutral base ceramic ingot is pressed into the mold. The pressed pattern is recovered and fit to the master die. Pigmented characterization ceramic (stain) is applied and fired in a conventional porcelain oven to achieve  the desired dentin and enam el  effects. Lastly, a fine-grained glazing m aterial is app lied and fired to provid e a  sealed s urface with a natu ral ap pearing luster and texture. 4.7. Layering Technique. A dentin shade ceramic ingot is pressed just as in the shading technique. The  rrespond to dentin colors of the Vita Lum in® and ingots for the layering technique are shaded to coChromascop™ shade guides. The pressed dentin core is contoured for enam el porcelain application. Modifiers and incisal porcelains are applied, conventionally fired, and contoured. The restoration is then glazed before insertion. Procedures for this technique are as follows: ll contour, sprued, invested, and then 4.7.1.  Cast  and  Die  Preparation. Construct a m aster cast with rem ovable dies and articu late, using procedures given in Chapter 1, Section 1F,  of this volume. Apply a removable die spacer to the dies and ensure the spacer does not cover any portion of the margin. 4.7.2. Wax-Up. Wax the crown to the exact desired full contour. At this point evaluate the wax-up for the minimum thickness necessary—1.5 mm axial surfaces, 2 mm incisa lly, and 1mm shoulder margin. If the wax cutback technique is to be used, cut back the enam el portion, leaving approximately 1.0 mm wax thickness for pressing the de ntin core (Figure 4.8). If the cutback w ill be accomplished in the pressed ceramic, refine the margins now.  180  Figure 4.8. Wax-Up for an IPS Empress® Crown. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  4.7.3. Spruing:  4.7.3.1. Attach a single 8-gauge sprue for mer, 6 to  8 mm long to the incisal area of anterior teeth or the noncritical cusp of posterior teeth. The attachm ent site should be flared and perfectly smooth to prevent any  turbulence when ceramic material flows into the m old (Figure 4.9-A). Do not use multiple sprue formers to the same wax pattern because a suture line may be evident after porcelain pressing. (NOTE: Sprue two to three units of one shade when possible because ingots are expensive and material buttons cannot be pressed again. 4.7.3.2. Seal the opening of the ring base (sprue ba se) with wax and weigh the base. Attach the patterns on the ring base at least 3 mm apart and 10 mm from the sides of the paper ring (Figure 4.9-B).  4.7.3.3. Unlike conventional casting s, sprued patterns  must be placed in  the thermal zone. The labial surface of anteriors should face center of the mold. This places the thickest portion of the pattern in the thermal zone.  4.7.3.4. Weigh the ring base with att ached patterns and subtract th e weight of the empty base. This figure is th e exact wax wei ght of the wax patterns. If the  pattern weight is less than .24 grams, invest an additional “dummy” pattern. This allows the furnace press plunger to travel at least 1 mm; otherwise, the pressing procedure will not end au tomatically. Patterns weighing .6 grams or less m ay be pressed from  a single  ceramic ingot. Patterns weighing between .6 and 1.4 grams will require 2 ingots of material. 4.7.4. Investing:  4.7.4.1. Select a paper investm ent ring and form a cylinder by pressing the  adhesive side along the marked line. Place the ring base on one end of the paper ring  and seat the ring stabilizer on the other end.  4.7.4.2. Choose the appropriate investm ent for the  layering or staining  technique. Investment for the laye ring te chnique is white  in color a nd the stain ing techn ique  investment is blue. Measure the investm ent and liqui d per the m anufacturer’s instruction chart and the n vacuum mix for 60 seconds.  4.7.4.3. Carefully fill the cylinder just below the ring stabilizer, remove the ring stabilizer, and slowly position investm ent gauge (Figure 4.9-C  and -D). The investment m ust press through AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  181 the hole in the gauge. A fter setting, remove the gauge, ring base , and paper. Scrape only the rough dimple created by the investment gauge. DO NOT alter the 90-degree angle of the mold.  Figure 4.9. Spruing and Investing an IPS Empress® Crown.  4.7.5. Burnout and Pressing:  4.7.5.1. Select the appro priate ceramic ingo ts for  the prescribed shade an d place them  with an  alox plunger on the support tray. Pl ace the m old and support tray  into a cold burnout furnace (Figure 4.10-A). Heat at a rate of 3 oC (or 37 oF) per minute to 850 oC (or 1560 oF) and hold for 90 minutes.   Figure 4.10.

The pressing cycle last approxim ately 45 m inutes. To com plete the cycle, rem ove the mold from furnace and place it on a raised wire r ack surface to promote quick, even cooling of the pressed mold (Figure 4.10-C). 4.7.6. Recovery:  4.7.6.1. Position an unused alox plun ger on the outside of the investm ent mold to m easure the depth the first plunger traveled  during the pressing. Mark this de pth around the outside of the cooled mold (Figure 4.11-A).  4.7.6.2. Cut along the line with a larg e separating disk and pry at  the line with a plaster knife (Figure 4.11-B). Rem ove the rem aining portion of  the investm ent, using glass beads at 58 psi and reducing to 29 psi when the ceramic becomes visible (Figure 4.11-C).  4.7.6.3.

If the crown was pressed to full contour,  reduce the enamel portion with diamonds or  abrasives, leaving a dentin core of at least .8 mm. Take care not to generate heat while grinding the cer amic m aterial. Excess hea t will caus e c racking of  the pressed ceram ic, req uiring the restoration to be remade.

Veneers can be used to cover discoloration and enam el defects,  close diastem as, repair  chipped teeth, and corre ct slightly m isaligned teeth. Many techniques are available for producing porcelain lam inate veneers, including th e pla tinum f oil te chnique, ref ractory  technique, and pressed ceram ics. This ch apter will discuss only the refractory technique. 4.9. Refractory Technique: 4.9.1. Master Cast Preparation (Figure 4.14-A). Pour the i mpression in die stone and allow to final set. Trim the cast to standard dim ensions and remove any soft tissue interference from  the margins and interproximal areas. Mark the margins with a red wax pencil and apply die spacer to within 1mm of the m argins. If possible, use a re movable die spacer to allo w for easier se ating of the finished veneers on the m aster cast. Ensure th e removable die spac er is com patible with the duplicating material used in the refractory cast fabrication (paragraph 4.9.2). 4.9.2. Refractory Cast Fabrication:  4.9.2.1. Box the m aster cast to in clude at least o ne adjacent tooth on both sides of the prepared teeth (Figure 4.14-B). Using a high quality duplicating material, make a mold of the boxed portion of the master cast (Figure 4.14-C).  4.9.2.2. After the duplicating m aterial has set, rem ove and inspect the i mpression for any voi ds particularly around the m argins. Pour the m old with a refractory  material designed for use with porcelain veneering systems. Pay close attention to the manufacturer’s directions (Figure 4.14-D).  4.9.2.3. Carefully remove the refractory cast from  the duplicating material. Inspect the refractory cast for voids in any critical areas. Trim  excess m aterial from the base of  the cast, ensuring th e base is sm ooth and flat (Figure 4.14-E). Pin and  base the cast, using the reverse pin technique (paragraph 4.9.2.4). 4.9.2.4. Seal the bottom of the cast with a die hardeneach die using a pindex  or parallel pinning m achine (Figure 4.14-F). In sert the do wel pins int o each hole. Do not glue the p ins in place, bu t ensure the p ins are stable (Figure 4.1 4-G). Box the cast and pour a stone base. After the s tone ha s set,  sepa rate the  base from  the refractory cast (Figure 4.14-H). W hen using this  technique, it is easier at this tim e not to separate  the cast into individual dies. The cast will be sectioned into individual dies after the first firing and contouring have been accom plished.

Degass the refractory cast in a bur nout oven following m anufacturer’s directions for the refractory material being used. After degassing, the refractory cast should exhibit a white color. Gray or black areas indicate the need for additional degassing (Figure 4.15-A). 4.9.4. Porcelain Application: 4.9.4.1. First, soak the refractory cast in distilled water to prevent the porcelain from drying out quickly during application. Repeat the soaking process after firing and before each new layer of porcelain is added. (The cast must be cooled completely before soaking.) 4.9.4.2. Mix and apply a m asking porcelain layer (F igure 4.15-B). The opacity and depth will vary depending on the esthetic requirem ents. If  you are c overing stains or discolored teeth, more masking porcelain is needed than if you are  closing diastemas. Dry and fire the porcelain following manufacturer’s directions. 4.9.4.3. Mix and apply body porcelain to  the cervical margin area and work toward the incisal, tapering to a sheer layer as the incisal edge is approached (Figure 4.15-C). Shape the mamelons with a brush if desired. Appl y incisal porcelain from  the incisal edge, tapering it onto body porcelain to create natural den tin-enamel blend (Figure 4.15-D) . Cut through the embrasures with a sharp instrument to separate the veneers. Fire the veneers in a porcelain oven, using the manufacturer’s guidelines for time and temperature.  186  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 4.9.4.4. Contour the porcelain with a  medium to fine grit diamond or stone (Figure 4.15-E). If porcelain additions are necessar y, thoroughly clean the veneers and then apply porcelain and fire it in accordance to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Figure 4.15-F).  Figure 4.15. Porcelain Application and Contouring.  4.9.5.  Section  the  Cast  Into  Individual  Dies. Use a dis c to cut section d ies that are to be removable. Stop the cuts just shy of the interproximal contact areas (Figure 4.16-A). Use a knife to score a notch from  the cut to  the co ntact areas.  Place thumbs on both  sides of the cut and g ently push together until the die breaks apart (Figure 4.16-B).  Figure 4.16. Sectioning the Cast Into Individual Dies.   4.9.6. Completing the Veneers: 4.9.6.1. Some cases may require porcelain contacts to  be added at this point, or m arginal areas may need to be added to and refined. To add porcelain,  rem ove the glaze and  clean the restoration. Then apply the samapplication. Be sure to add  enough porcelain to allow for re-c ontouring. The porcelain addition must be meticulously applied, shaped, and well condensed.

Divest the com pleted restoration by removi ng the bulk of the refr actory material from the inside of the veneer with a #8 bur. Be careful not to touch the m argins (Figure 4.17-A). Finish cleaning the refractory from the inside  of the veneer with 25-micron aluminum oxide or glass beads at 40 psi (Figure 4.17-B). Take care  through the veneer or altering the marginal areas. 4.9.6.3. Seat the veneer on the master cast by first carefully removing any overextensions of the margins with a rubber wheel (Figure 4.17-C). If possible, rem ove the die spacer from the cast. Use a disclosing medium and gently seat the ve neer onto the cast (Figure 4.17-D). Light finger pressure is essential to prevent b reaking the thin porcelain veneers. Reli eve discrepancies with a fine diamond at slow speeds (Figure 4.17-Ee veneer is  completely seated (Figure 4.17-F). 4.9.6.4. Etch the veneers by first covering exterior  surfaces with wax and attaching sprue wax to the facial surface to act as a holding device  during the etching process. Apply etching gel(7.5 percent hydrofluoric acid) to the inside su rface of the veneer. After appropriate etch ing time has elapsed, neutralize th e veneers in a 10  percent solution of baking soda and water or neutralizer provided with the etching gel.

Resin veneered fixed prostheses are beco ming increasingly popular  in dentistry today. New materials are m aking it possib le to fabricate an es thetic and durable restor ation with r esin. Resin materials are available to fabricate veneers, inlays, onlays, and full coverage crowns as well as the m ore traditional m etal venee red c rowns and FPDs. Resin-ve neered r estorations are  ver y sim ilar to  m etal-ceramic res torations in  preparation  requirem ents a nd fabrication technique. A ll-resin preparations are  very sim ilar to the all- ceramic pre parations ( Chapter 4).  This chapter will discuss the f abrication technique for two resin systems currently on the market—Sinfony® by ESPE America Incorporated, and Targis™ by Ivoclar Williams, Ivoclar North America, Incorporated.  Section 5B—Targis™ All Resin Crown 5.2.  Overview.  Targis™ has m any uses in addition to veneering m etal crowns. It m ay be used as a metal-free crown for anterior teeth, inlays, onlays, a nd veneers. Metal-free pos terior crowns and FPDs  can be fabricated with Targis™ inreinforced c omposite mater ial tha t repla ces th e m etal fra mework. However, Vectris™ and T argis™ should not be used to construct a metal-free FPD with multiple pontics between two abutments. 5.3. Cast Preparation. A master cast with removable dies must first be fabricated and articulated. Use the techniques described in Chapter 1, Section 1F,  of this volum e. When fabricating a Vectris™ FPD substructure, it is he lpful to leave  the abu tments  and pontic portions in one p iece until af ter the  substructure is completed. Avoid sharp edges on the cast because they can damage the membrane during the formation process. The base of the m odel must also be flat to prevent it  from cracking while under high pressure during later steps. A pply a die hardener and allow it to  dry completely. Apply two layers of Targis™ Model Separator, waiting 3 minutes between each layer. 5.4. Metal-Free Bridge Framework Fabrication:  conjunction with a V ectris™ su bstructure. V ectris™ is a fiber-5.4.1. Silicone Key. Place a wax wire with a diameter of at least 3 mm between the two abutments and secure in place. Observe the placement of the connectors when positioning the wax wire. This wax represents the pontic and should be m odified by adding wax so it is slightly oval in shape (Figure 5.1). Re move segments of the m odel not  associated with the framework. Use silicone to make a key that covers the abutm ents and the wax  wire. Be sure to adapt  the silicone to the under  side of the wax wire completely with no voids. Leave the occlusal area open. After the silicone has set up, remove the wax  wire. Trim any silicon e material covering the occl usal surface to allo w light to reach the en tire occlusal surface during the curing p rocess. Apply two additional coats o f separator to the model. 5.4.2.  Spillways. Use a separating disc to cut two pe channel. The spillways will allow e xcess matrix to flow off during pro cessing of the Vectr is™ substructure known as deep drawin g. The fiber  reinforced com posite will be condensed m ore homogeneously with this technique.  5.4.3. Fabrication of Vectris™ Pontics. Apply Vectris™ glue to the base of the cavity formed by the wire wax. Remove the Vectris™ Pontic from the package and trim a piece of th e rope shaped material to fit into the cavity formed by the wire wax (Figure 5.2). Cut a second piece of Vectris™ pontic long enough to cover th e entire length of the occlusal surface.  Place this rope on top of th e rpendicular sp illways off of the ponticAFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  189 first piece. Use the Vectris™ VS 1 curing unit to for m and cure the pontic with program  P1 for 9 minutes (Figure 5.3). Be sure to follow the m anufacturer’s operating instructions for the Vectris™ VS1 curing unit.  Figure 5.1. Wax Pontic Placement.  Figure 5.2. Vectris™ Pontic Placement.  5.4.4. Finishing of the Vectris™ Pontic:    5.4.4.1. Carefully rem ove the cured pontic withoutmaterial with a carbide bur to conform to the following dimensions:  dam aging the silicone key. Trim  excess 5.4.4.1.1. The pontic should be slightly higher than wide (oval in shape). 5.4.4.1.2. The diam eter must be at least 2 mm a nd the pontic m ust touch the abutm ents in the proximal area. 5.4.4.1.3. The occlusal stop portion  must be a m inimum of 0.3 mm thick and cover at least 1/3 of the occlusal area. 5.4.4.2. Blast the contoured pontic with alum inum oxide at 1 bar pressure; then steam  clean thoroughly. 190  Figure 5.3. Vectris™ VS1 Curing Unit. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005   5.4.4.3. Apply Vectris™ wetting agent on the cleane d pontic and wait for 1 m inute. Blow any excess wetting agent off with compressed air. 5.4.4.4. Trim  the silico ne key used  to form  the pontic. E xpose at least 4/5 of th e abutm ent preparation, leaving the m argins covered. Also  provide a sp ace below the pontic to  adapt the frame around the pontic. Apply 2 a dditional coats of separator and allow to dry. Return the pontic portion to the dies, using a small amount of Vectris™ glue to hold in place if necessary. 5.4.5. Trimming of the Vectris™ Frame. Trim the Vectris™ fram e to a s ize sufficient to cover both abutments and pontic. For m aximum adaptation, make small cuts between the abutm ent and pontic on each side of the m aterial. Apply Ve ctris™ glue on the pontic and place the trimmed frame on the m odel (Figure 5.4). Position the mode l into the Vectris ™ VS1 curing unit and deep draw and cure the frame with program P1. 5.4.6. Finishing of the Vectris™ Frame: 5.4.6.1. Carefully rem ove the frame from  the mode l. Trim the fra me with a carbide bur to expose the cervical 1/3 p ortion of the crown. Do  not grind on the occlusal surface because this will weaken the f rame greatly reduc ing the stre ngth of the f inished prosthesis. The Vectris™  Frame must cover at least 2/3 of the pontic.  5.4.6.2. Blast the finished fra me with aluminum oxide at 1 bar pressure and then steam  clean. Apply Vectris™ wetting agent on the frame and wait 60 seconds (Figure 5.5).  5.4.6.3. Remove excess with com pressed air.

Vectris™ Framework Completion.    5.5. Targis™ Dentin and Enamel Buildup: 5.5.1.  Application  of  Basic  Shade  with  Targis™  Base  (Figure  5.6-B). Begin by applying Targis™ base to the entire fram e one segment at a time (Figure 5.6-C). Apply the material to the  preparation m argin. Precure each o f these seg ments for 20 seconds with Targ is™ quick -curing light (Figure 5.6-D). After precure is com plete, remove the air-inhibited la yer with a disposable sponge. Do not to remove the fram e from the di es at th is tim e because the Targis™ base isunsupported and easily broken. 5.5.2. Modeling and Layering:  5.5.2.1. Apply Targis™ dentin to th e restoration, using the norm al dentin or incisal buildup technique (Figure 5.6-E and -F). The m aximum layer thickness is 2 mm. Precure each segm ent 192  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 for 20 seconds in the Targis™ quick before m oving on. Do not m ix the m aterials because as this will trap air in the buildup.   Figure 5.6. Targis™ Dentin and Enamel Buildup.  5.5.2.2. Pat the material, using a modeling instrument after it has been dispensed. The modeling instrument can be dipped into  a sponge saturated with m odeling liquid to reduce the stickiness  of the m aterial. After the den tin buildup is complete, the cr own may be supplemented, using Targis™ transparent an d stains, b efore the incis al is app lied. If using these characterizations, precure each segm ent with the Targis™ quick for 10 seconds before m oving on. Apply Targis™ incisal to complete the contours of the crown (Figure 5.6-G and -H). 5.5.3. Curing with Targis™ Power. Apply a generous coat of Targ is™ gel to th e restoration to prevent formation of an air inhibited lay er during curing (Figure 5.6-I). Place the resto ration into  193 AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  the Targis™ power curing unit. Heat and light  cure it for approxim ately 25 m inutes on program P1 (Figure 5.6-J). Rem ove it fr om the unit after curing and warunning water. 5.5.4. Finishing and Polishing. Use carbide burs to accomplish any ne cessary final contou ring. Follow this up by prepolishing the restoration w ith pumice and a wet brush wheel on slow speed. Do not apply pressure while polishing; slow speeds w ith little or no pressure give the best results (Figure 5.6-K). Apply Targis™ polishing paste to the restoration and polis h without pressure at 8,000 to 10,000 revolutions per m inute (rpm ). If the desired high gloss is not achieved, the restoration was polished too quickly and with too much pressure. sh away the Targis™ gel with  Section 5C—Sinfony® Resin-Veneered Metal Crown 5.6.  Overview. Sinfony ® is a light-curing com posite system us ed for veneering fixed and removable restorations with m etal frameworks and the individualizing  of acrylic and porcela in teeth (F igure 5.7). To prevent fractu res with Sinfony ®, the m aterial must not be app lied less than 0.8 mm for facings and not less than 1mm for occlusal facings. ions, the resin can be freely g lateral and protrusive excurs5.6.1. Metal Framework. The framework for a resin-veneered metal crown is very similar to the framework used for a metal-ceramic crown. It is recommended, though, that incisal guidance be in metal to prevent veneer m aterial from shearing off during lateral and protrusive excursions. If the veneer is not under pressure durinextended up to 1.5 mm . For information on the de sign and fabrication of  metal frameworks, see Chapter 2, Section 2C, of this volume. Be sure the metal used is indicated by the manufacturer for use with veneering composites. Finish the framework, polish nonresin bearing surfaces, and steam clean before veneering with Sinfony® (Figure 5.7-A). 5.6.2. Retention System. Mechanical (such as beads) or  a chemical bond can achieve retention between th e m etal substruc ture  and the resin. The ESPE Rocatecrecommended for use with Sinfony ®. Rocatec ® is a three-step system  that chemically bonds the composite to the metal with no marginal gap or any other mechanical retention. The quality of the chemical bond achieved with Rocatecacturer’s directions. If no che mical bonding system is being us ed, mechanical retention such as beads will need to be incorporated into the veneer’s metal surface. Procedures for Rocatec® are as follows: ® depends on strict adherence to the manuf® adhesion system is 5.6.2.1. Step One—Rocatec® Pre (Figure 5.7-B). Use the Rocatec® Pre side of the Rocatector unit to blast each veneer surface individually. This  will clean and create rough indentations on  the metal’s veneer surface. The blasting tim e for each restoration is app roximately 10 seconds at 2.5 bar pressure. If you are usin g nonprecio us metal, it m ay be necessary to in crease the  pressure by raising the regulator on the rocatector unit. 5.6.2.2.  Step  Two—Rocatec®  Plus  (Figure  5.7-C). Use the Rocatec ® Plus side of the Rocatector unit to again blast each veneer surface ind ividually. T his creates a partially embedded adhesive coating into the alloy’s texture. Blast each restoration for 13 seconds at 2.5 bar pressure. The Rocatector unit is equipped w completion. It is v ital that th e  blasting d irection be perpen dicular to the m etals surface at a distance of 10 cm. When blasting is complete, there should be a uniform dark coloration on the metal to indicate correct coverag e of the m aterial. Do not touch the veneer surface once Rocatec® Plus has been appliedcompromised. ith an acoustic tim er as an indicator for because the bond with the Sinfony® vene er can be  194  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 5.6.2.3.  Step  Three—Silane  Coupling  Agent  (Figure  5.7-D). The Rocatec ® Plus does not provide an adequate bond with the veneer m aterial on its own. Apply a coupling agent (ESPE Sil) to provide the chemically binding adhesive necessary for the Sinfony ® opaquer. Proportion ESPE  Sil into a clean dappen dish. Usi ng the special brush provided with  the system, apply the solution by soaking the brush tip and brushing over the surface of the veneer. Allow the ESPE Sil to dry  at room temperature for 5 minutes; then coat it immediately with opaque.   Figure 5.7. Sinfony® Resin-Veneered Crown.  5.6.3. Opaque Application (Figure 5.7-E): 5.6.3.1. Dispense the appropriate opaque (pow der and liquid) onto a ceram ic mixing tray and mix with a plastic spatula. Mixi ng time is 45 seconds. Apply a th in masking coat of opaque to the veneer surface. Ligh t cure it for 5 seconds,  using the Visio Alpha lig ht curing unit (Figure  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  195 5.7-F).

Cure minimal amounts of the intensive opaque for 10 seconds with the Visio Alpha light; cure larger areas for 30 seconds. Check for complete curing of the opaque, using the wooden tip of a brush and, if necessary, cu re for addition al tim e. It  is im portant not to tou ch the veneer surface because the chemical bonding will be affected.  5.6.3.4. After the opaque layer is completed, immediately begin applying the dentine layer. eer surface and polym erize it with  auxiliary ive opaqu es can b e a pplied at th is tim e to 5.6.4. Dentine Application:  5.6.4.1. Apply a separating agent to  any areas of the cast that m ay be exposed to the Sinfony ® materials. Start by building up the dentine directly from the dispenser, or with an instrument, in layers no thicker than 1mm (Figure 5.7-G). Because Sinfony® materials are light sensitive, keep the dispenser closed when not in use.  5.6.4.2. As each 1 mm  layer is app lied, cure for 5  seconds with the Visio Alpha lig ht (Figure 5.7-H). This interm ediate 5-second polym erization leaves a s mear layer on the resin that is required for bonding with the next layer. Never  grind on or rem ove this sm ear layer until th e entire buildup has been completed.  5.6.4.3. Sinfony ® Opaque Dentin can also be applied at this tim e to r educe translu cency in  appropriate areas. Due to the higher opacity of the opaque dentin, ensure these m aterials are cured fully and not applied thicker th an 1 mm. Continue applying Sinfony® dentine layers until the correct dentin contour has been achieved (Figure 5.7-I). 5.6.5.  Incisal  Application. Overla y the buildu p with the Sinf ony® incisa l m aterial in the sa me manner as the dentine (Figure 5.7 -J). Cure each individual layer for 5 seconds with a Visio Alpha curing light. Once the restoration has been built to contour, accomplish final polymerization in the Visio Beta curing unit on the main program for 15 minutes under vacuum (Figure 5.7-K). 5.6.6.  Finishing  the  Resin  Metal  Veneer. Do not ginal polymerization is completed in the Visio Beta curing unit. Contour the veneer with cross-cut burs. Accomplish additional sm oothing with rubber polishers, fini shing from coarse to fine polishers. Rubber polishers are especially useful to create a sm ooth m etal-to-resin junction. Use a sm all white buff wheel witho ut polish to  prepolish the veneer. N ext, use the opal high luster polishing paste on a polishing wheel to create a high luster.  Clean the restoration in an ultrasonic or under running water. Do not use a steam  cleaner becau se heat from  the steam  cleaner m ay cause marginal gaps or fractures due to the different thermal expansion values of the resin and the metal. 5.6.7. Adjustments after Finishing. If additional resin m ust be  applied after finishing, roughen the surface, moisten with Sinfony® Activator, and wipe off any excess activator with a clean cloth. Proceed to buildup and cure as described in the preceding steps. rind on th e venee r u ntil the f 196  6.1.

When fabricating dental implant prostheses, be sure to closely follow the manufacturer’s directions for the system being used to maximize the chances of success.  options can now have function and esthetics  Figure 6.1. Implant Prosthesis.   6.2.  Standard  Components  for  Implant  Systems.  Most im plant system s on the m arket to day are similar in the types of com ponents used (Figure 6.2) . The following is a description of the standard components necessary to complete a restoration: 6.2.1. Fixture (Figure 6.2-A). The fixture is a perm anent device  that is im planted into the bon e after the dentist has drilled a hole in the proper lo cation and angle. Fixtures can be of screw type, self-tapping screw, hollow cylinder, hollow screw or m any other designs. The most comm on material for fixtures is Titanium . Titanium is an  inert material that develops the titanium  oxide layer necessary for the bone-to-implant fusion, which firmly holds the fixture in place. The fixture is normally placed en tirely inside th e bone with an  opening that is flush with the surface of the bone. 6.2.2. Cover Screw (Figure 6.2-B). The cover screw is placed or screw ed into the opening of the fixture at the time the fixture is  surgically placed into the b one. Cover screws allow the fixture to osseointegrate with the bone without bone or tissue growing into  the opening of the fixture during  the healing process. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 6.2. Components of the Implant System. 197  6.2.3. Abutment (Figure 6.2-C). The abutment is the por tion of the implant tha t attaches to the  fixture and supports and retains th e restorative com ponents. The abutm ent is situated from  the surface of the fixture, at bone level, and throug h the tissue. It stops no rmally just at or slightly above the gingival tissue. The abutm ent is held  in place with an abutm ent screw . There are a  variety of sizes and styles of abutments available to adapt to different needs. 6.2.3.1. Healing Abutment (Figure 6.2-D). Healing abutm ents are used  in place of standard abutments following second stage surgery (see paragraph 6.5.2). Healing abutments are desired when a specialized abutm ent is needed for the  restoration or when the  length of the standard  198  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 abutment is not known. These abutm ents are provided as a one-piece abutm ent and screw. The abutment allows the tissue to heal and reorganize into a unique peri-implant membrane. 6.2.3.2. Specialized Abutments (Figure 6.2-E). Each implant system may include specialized abutments, which are u sed to optim ize esthetics, or com pensate for the lack of interocclusal space. 6.2.3.3. Angulated Abutment (Figure 6.2-F): 6.2.3.3.1. Angulated abutm ents are us ed to compensate for fixt ures that ar e not ideally placed. Fixtures need a sufficient amount of bone to be properly implanted.  6.2.3.3.2. There are cases where the fixtures are improper or necessary implant placem ent. Angulated abutments can correct this angulation problem up to 30 degrees. However, a corrdestructive lever system on the final restoration. This is most commonly seen when a severe labial undercut in the anterior alveolar ridgeation of the fixture. Restoring the dentition with a  standard abutment in this pos ition would result in an access channel for the gold screw to emerge through the facial surface of the restoration. Angulated abutments compensate for this by angling the  implant a position where the restoration will be placed esthetically. ection of this m agnitude would create a angled to the facial or lingual due to  dictates labial angul6.2.3.4. Healing Caps (Figure 6.2-G). Healing caps are placed on top of the standard abutment during the healing process after  second stage surgery. The h ealing cap protects the abutm ent screw and the precision  m illed surfaces of the standard abutm ent until the res toration or provisional restoration is ready to be inserted. 6.2.4. Temporary Components (Figure 6.2-H). Temporary components are usually a cylinder, tube, or cap on which a provisional restoration is fabricated. The temporary component attaches to the abu tment with a s crew, tem porary cem ent, or  friction gripping of  precisely m anufactured components available with som e implant systems. The temporary is commonly used in place of the healing cap. 6.2.5. Impression Coping (Figure 6.2-I). The impression coping is plac ed or screwed on top of the abutment before the final im pression is made. The impression coping is  then picked up inside the impression material to transfer the exact locati on of the fixture or abutm ent to the master cast. Before the impression is poured with dental stone,  an abutment replica (analog) is attached to the impression coping. The cast is then  poured, res ulting in the analog bein g positioned in the sam e location on the cast as the fixture or abutment is in the patient’s mouth. 6.2.6.  Guide  Pins  (Figure  6.2-J). Guide pins screw direc tly in to th e standard,  sp ecialized, or angulated abutments; gold cylinders; abutm ent replicas; or temporary components. They are used during laboratory procedures to en sure the restorative components remain in precise contact with the abutment replica. Guide pins should be used during surgery, final impression, framework wax-up, and porcelain application to ensure proper esthetic and functional fabrication of restorations. 6.2.7. Abutment Replicas (Figure 6.2-K). The abutment replica (lab oratory analog) is an ex act reproduction of the abutm ent that a ttaches to the fixture. It is used as the m aster die for the  technician. The abutm ent rep lica attach es to   the im pression coping prior to pouring the final impression. After the final im pression is separated  from the m aster cast, the abutment replica is  three dim ensionally pos itioned on the m aster c ast  exactly as the abutm ent is position ed in the patient’s mouth. 6.2.8. Gold Cylinder (Figure 6.2-L). The gold cylinder is the restor ative component that attaches AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  199 to the abutment and around which the restoration is built. It is norm ally 3 to 4 mm in height. The technician attaches the gold cylinder to the abut ment replica with a gu ide pin and then waxes the restoration around cylinder, leaving a hole in the top for access to the screw that holds the cylinder in place. The wax-up is then cast to the gold cylinder, using the lost wax technique. 6.2.9. Gold Screws (Figure 6.2-M). Gold screws are used clinically to atta ch the te mporary or permanent restoration to the abutm ent. Two types ar e used. One is a fl at head screw with a slot, and the other is a flat head screw with a inte rnal hexagon or square. The internal hexagon screw has a taller screw head and requires greater interocclusal space. 6.2.10. Protection Caps (Figure 6.2-N). The protection cap is a stainless steel cap that attaches to the gold cylinder. It should be in place anaccomplished. Its purpo se is to protect the surf ace  and shape of the prosthetic co mponent that attaches to the abutment. y tim e sandblasting, grinding, or polishing is 6.3. Procedural Overview. The steps for fabricating an osseoint egrated implant are shown below (and in Figure 6.3): eliminary wax-up is accom plished to determ ine 6.3.1. The diagnostic cast is articulated and a prfunctional and esthetic requirements (Figure 6.3-A). 6.3.2. The dentist accomplishes trea tment planning to decide on num ber and location of im plant fixtures. A radiographic stent m ay be used to he lp determine if enough bone is available for the implant fixtures (Figure 6.3-B). 6.3.3. A surgical tem plate is fabricated to assist th e surgeon in placing the  implants in the proper location (Figure 6.3-C). 6.3.4. The first surgical procedure pe rformed is placing the implant fi xtures into the bone with the cover screw (Figure 6.3-D). 6.3.5. The second surgical procedure  performed is placing the abutm ent and healing cap (Figure 6.3-E). 6.3.6. Provisional restoration is made if necessary (Figure 6.3-F). 6.3.7. The custom tray is made for the final impression (Figure 6.3-G). 6.3.8. A master cast is made from the final impression and articulated (Figure 6.3-H). 6.3.9. The prosthesis framework is constructed (Figure 6.3-I and -J). 6.3.10. The porcelain, resin, or denture is processed to the framework (Figure 6.3-K). 6.3.11. The prosthesis is inserted. 6.4. Osseointegration Process:  laced in to the m andible or m axillae and  held in place through 6.4.1. Im plants are pchorage of an inert m aterial osseointegration. Osseointegration is  defined as the direct bone an(usually Titanium) that provides a f oundation to  support the prosthesis. After the im plant fixture has been p laced into the bone, osseointeg ration requires new bone form ation to firm ly hold it in place.  6.4.2. When the implant is first inse rted, a layer of oxide form s on the Titanium implant. A layer of glycoprotein approxim ately 100 m icrons thick  then form s and provides hard direct contact between the bone and the im plant fixture’s oxid e. Over tim e, spongy (cancellous) bone develops around the fixture, which will eventually form into compact bone as occlusal forces are applied.  200  Figure 6.3. Fabricating a Fixed Implant. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005   6.4.3. Bone-to-implant interface occurs at approximately 3 to 6 months after surgical placement of the im plant fixture. The m andible is com posed m ostly of hard er com pact cortical bone and, consequently, heals faster than the softer cancellous bone found in the maxillae.  6.4.4. To com plete the process, bone-to-implantosseointegration is the ability to transm it occlusal forces directly to the bone. However, careful planning m ust be don e to ensu re these forces  are  distributed m ore vertically th an latera lly to reduce traumatic failure of the implant.  infusion m ust occur. An advantage of 6.5.  Implant  Surgery. Surgery to place  the  implants is us ually acc omplished in the  f ollowing two stages: 6.5.1. First Stage Surgery. First s tage surgery is the process  of placing the im plant fixtures into the bone, as follows: AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  201 e proper size hole to receive the fixture. 6.5.1.1. First, a tissue flap reflectio n is done to expose  the bone. Next, a seri es of drilling and countersinking procedures are done to produce thDrilling is accomplished at slow speeds with irr igation to dissipate any frictional heat that m ay be generated, which would damage the bone thereby com promising osseointegration. Depending on the type of fixture, the hole may need to be tapped to produce threads on the wall of the bone.  6.5.1.2. The fixture is then screwed or tapped into place with the top of the fixture located at the surface of the bone. A cover screw  is screwed into th e top of th e fixture to p revent tissue or bone growth from contaminating the top surface of the fixture. The tissue is then readapted and sutured in p lace. The fixture rem ains covered  while healing and bone-to-im plant fusion takes place. This process will take from 4 to 6 months depending on the type of bone.  6.5.1.3. A tem porary prosthesis is used after severa l weeks have past, but  care must be taken not to apply pressure on the fixture during healing. This coul d cause implant  failure, due to exposure and bacterial infiltration. 6.5.2.  Second  Stage  Surgery. Stage two surg eries are more of  a m inor soft tissue surgery to expose the fixture and attach the abutments: 6.5.2.1. The fixture is first located though the tissue w ith the help of the su rgical stent and an explorer. After the cover screw is  located, a sm all incision is m ade to expose the cover screw. A punch is then used to rem ove tissue and expo se the entire cover sc rew. After removing the cover screw, all soft and hard tissue is cleaned away from the fixture opening.  6.5.2.2. Next, the appropriate type of abut ment is  attached to the fixture, using the abutm ent screw. If a specialized , esthetic, o r angled ab utment is used for the restoration, a healing abutment is  placed  at this stage. When the co rrect length of standard abutm ent is used, the  abutment should be at or 1 mm higher than the gi ngival margin in the maxilla and 1 to 2 mm in the mandible. Make sure the abutment is not to long for both esthetics and speech function.  6.5.2.3. Aft er the standard abutm ents are secured  in place, healing caps are placed over the abutment to protect the p recision surfaces during the healing process. If a tem porary prosthesis is to be used, a healing cap will not be necessary. 6.6. Radiographic Templates: radiographic exam ination to assist in the 6.6.1. Radiographic templates are used during the diagnosis of implant placement in the patient (Figure 6.4). Radiographic template are clear acrylic with ball bearings, or metal rods, positioned in the template as radiographic reference points above the implant fixtures proposed positioned.  6.6.2. The tem plate can help show  the am ount of bone available for the im plant fixture by comparing the known size of the m etal component in the templates to the am ount of bone shown on the radiograph regardless of distortion.  6.6.3. Metal rods are also positioned through the cente r of the proposed restoration, paralleling the axial inclination of the restoration, so it can be us ed as a guide to the ideal buccal or lingual angle  of the im plant fixture. In addition, the m esial-distal dis tance between teeth for s ingle im plant fixtures can be evaluated. Any  anatomic anomalies may als o be  discovered, utilizing the guide template.  6.6.4. To fabricate a partial edentulous radiographic template: 202  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  registration provided by the 6.6.4.1. Articulate the diagnostic cas t in MI or use the occlusaldentist. 6.6.4.2. Perform  a diagnostic wax-up. Denture teeth  may be used or a full contour wax-up performed (Figure 6.4-A). After  the wax-up is com pleted and ev aluated, it is a good idea to fabricate a tooth position index with silicone putty for later use. 6.6.4.3.

Trim  the tem plate to just belo w the gingival m argins of the existing teeth and include all of the diagnostic waxed-up areas. After the template is trimm ed, lightly air-abrade the areas that are edentulous on the diagnostic cast. 6.6.4.5. Remove the diagnostic wax-up from  the di agnostic cast. Survey and block out any undercuts in the edentulous areas of the cast. 6.6.4.6. Apply a separator to the dilic and fill the edentulous areas of the template (Figure 6.4-D). Place the template onto the diagnostic cast and ensure it is seated p roperly. After the acry lic has cured, trim any excess acrylic, smooth, and polish. 6.6.4.7. The dentist will clearly mark the position of the implants on the diagnostic cast. 6.6.4.8. Place the tem plate on the d iagnostic cast. The m arks for the po sition of th e implants should be visible through the cl ear acrylic. Carefully drill a hol e at the site  of each proposed implant (Figure 6.4-E). The hole mu st be at th e exact location a nd correct axial inclination of the proposed implants. 6.6.4.9. Place a m etal radiographic indicator into  each hole and seal in  place with acrylic o r cyanoacrylate (Figure 6.4-F). AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  6.6.5. To fabricate a fully edentulous radiographic template: 203 6.6.5.1. Duplicate the existing denture with clear acr ylic, using the technique from Volum e 1, Chapter 7, Section 7AK. 6.6.5.2. The dentist will precisely mark the position of the implants on the cast. 6.6.5.3. Place the duplicated denture on the cast and  drill holes through the  clear denture at the position of each proposed im plant. The holes must  be at the exact loca tion and correct axial inclination of the proposed implants 6.6.5.4. Place a m etal radiographic indicator into  each hole and seal in  place with acrylic o r cyanoacrylate. 6.6.5.5. Trim and the polish the template as needed. 6.7. Surgical Guide Templates: 6.7.1. Surgical guide templates are used during the fi rst stage surgery as a guide to implant fixture placement (Figure 6.5). The surgical guide tem plate provides the surgeo n with a prosthetic guid e to placement and angulation of fixtures.   Figure 6.5. Fabricating a Partially Edentulous Surgical Guide Template.  6.7.2. Surgical guide templates are essentially thtemplates. The m ain difference between the two is that n o metal indicators are p laced in th e surgical guide tem plate. However, the proposed implant area is hollowed out  to provide room for  the surgeon to drill in to the bone with the surgical guide template in place.  e sam e as radiographic   registration provided by the 6.7.3. The diagnostic wax-up of the proposed restoratio ns is reproduced in acrylic to act as the guide for the buccal-lingual placement of the implants. 6.7.4. To fabricate a partially edentulous surgical guide templates: 6.7.4.1. Articulate the diagnostic cas t in MI or use the occlusaldentist. 6.7.4.2. Perfor m a diagnostic wax-up (Figure 6.5-A).  Denture teeth m ay be  used or a full contour wax-up perform ed. The s ilicone putty  matrix th at was m ade when f abricating th e radiographic template may be used to accomplish the wax-up. 6.7.4.3. Finish the wax-up for the surgical guide te mplate by extending wax over the occlusals of the teeth adjacen t to the diagnostic wax-up (Figure 6.5-B). This will be used as a positive seat for the guide template. 6.7.4.4. Process the wax-up in clear acrylic, using bases (Figure 6.5-C). Trim and polish the completed surgical guide template. 6.7.4.5. Clean the diagnostic cast of all wax and ha ve the dentist m ark the ideal locations for the implant fixtures on the cast. 6.7.4.6.

To fabricate for an edentulous surgical guide template: 6.7.5.1. Evaluate the existing denture  to see if it m eets the functional and esthetic dem ands of the patient. Make any necessary adjustments: 6.7.5.2. Duplicate the denture in clear acrylic, using conventional methods. 6.7.5.3. The dentist will now m ark the implant sites on the cast. (T he sites should not interfere with the placement of teeth nor should the angulation affect the  facial-lingual inclination of the teeth.) 6.7.5.4. Cut guide holes or a slot at  the sites of the proposed implant fixtures. This will give the surgeon a starting point to drill the holes for the fixtures without affecting the positioning of the teeth for the restoration. 6.8. Custom Tray. Requirements for fabricating an im plant custom tray (Figure 6.6)  are essentially the same as those for a standard denture or fixed custom tray:   Figure 6.6. Fabricating an Implant Custom Tray.  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  205 t while m aintaining a unifor m thickness of 6.8.1. The tray m ust provide for patient comforimpression material. It must also  provide a stab le access area for  impression copings that utilize guide pins. This is accomplished by an opening in the area above the implants.  6.8.2. Depending on the im pression copings used, not  all require an opening in the tray. Some impression copings stay on the abutm ent when removing the impression from the mouth and then are removed and placed into the impression.  6.8.3. The following procedures describe an open im pression tray with square im pression copings and guide pins: (NOTE: Impression copings that are removed in the impression are recommended for increased accuracy.) 6.8.3.1. To open the custom  tray for im plant restorations, the dentist first m akes an alginate impression for the diagnostic cast. This is done with the healing caps in place on the abutments. The impression is poured and trimmed, using the standard guidelines for diagnostic cast. 6.8.3.2. Follow the dentist’s guideli nes for designing the tray and block out any significanttissue undercuts.  6.8.3.3. Block out the area around the healing abut ments with wax or clay (Figure 6.6-A). Using the dentist’s gu idelines, apply the necessa ry amount of relief to the tissue areas to bimpressed (Figure 6.6-B). 6.8.3.4. Mix and apply custom tray material to the cast in the usual manner. The only difference is to leave the area open over the blockout that wa s applied to the healing abutm ents. After the material has cured, trim the tray  to the design line and remove  all blockout m aterial (Figure  6.6-C). e  6.9.  Master  Cast.  Accuracy of the m aster cast (Figure 6 .7)  is of  the utm ost importance. Precise ly accomplish the following steps to ensure the fit of the finished restoration: 6.9.1. Disinfect the im pression and then exam ine the impression copings for stability in the impression material. Also, look for overflow impr ession material on the se ating surfaces of the copings (Figure 6.7-A). Any excess material indicates the copings were not properly seated on the abutments during the im pression procedure and, th erefore, the im pression will need to be reaccomplished.  6.9.2. To attach abutment replica for square impression copings with guide pins, remove the guide pins and gently blow air through  the holes to remove de bris. Seat an abutm ent replica on each of the impression copings and attach with a guide pin (Figure 6.7-B). 6.9.3. To attach abutm ent replica for tapered im pression copings, exam ine the tapered copings’ surface imprint in the impression for any debris or impression defects. Attach an abu tment replica to each of the im pression copings and then carefully seat the c opings into the im pression. Firmly seat each coping back into the impression before moving onto pouring the impression. 6.9.4. Use a  soft tissue model in the area of the abutm ents. After the abutm ent replicas are in place, pour soft tissue m aterial directly into th e impression. Because the soft tissu e material and impression m aterial are norm ally both vinyl poly siloxanes, a good separating m edium must be first applied to the im pression. Apply soft tissue m aterial around each o f the abutm ents, leaving the end of each abutm ent replica exposed for stone to be pour ed around it (F igure 6.7-C). W hen pouring, do not allow the material to run into the adjacent teeth areas.  206  Figure 6.7. Master Cast Procedures. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005   6.9.5. Bead and box the im pression if necessar y. Vacuu m m ix the die stone and pour the impression. Be careful not to use excess vibratio n, which may dislodge some types of i mpression copings. 6.9.6. After the stone has com pletely set, rem ove the guide pins and lift the im pression from the cast. If tapered impression copings are used, remove the impression with a snap. Examine the cast for any discrepancies. (Ensure the precision surfaces of the abutment replicas are clean and free of any stone.) Trim the cast in the usual manner (Figure 6.7-D). 6.10. Provisional Restorations: 6.10.1. After First Stage Surgery. Temporary, complete or partial dentures can be inserted when the sutures are rem oved (7 to 10 da ys after surg ery). Existing com plete or partial dentures can easily be made to f it over the im plant sites. Simply relieve the fixture area of the denture acrylic and reline it with soft-tissue conditioner. Do not apply any pressure to the fixture sites at this time. If acrylic is  protruding through the soft liner,  perform additional reduction and app ly more soft tissue conditioner. Reline the denture in the conventional manner after 1 month. 6.10.2. After Second Stage Surgery. At this po int, the abutment and healing caps are protruding through the tissue. For com plete dentures, relieve enough acrylic to  seat the denture without any interference with the healing cap and then reline it again with a soft-tissue conditioner.  6.10.3. Provisional Restoration for a Single-Tooth, Cement-Retained Implant: 6.10.3.1.  Laboratory-Fabricated  Provisional  (Figure  6.8). First, take an im pression and make a cast with a soft tissue  section around the abutment replica. Next, place a temporary cap on the abutm ent replica and adjust the length  so there is no interf erence with the opposing occlusion (Figure 6.8-A and -B). If a light-cured resin is going to be used it can now be applied, AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  207 cured, and shaped to the desired contours (Figure 6.8-C). You may also wax up a tooth directly to the tem porary cap and process it with heat cured acry lic in th e necessary sh ade. After  processing, finish, polish, and ready the provisional for cementation with temporary cement.  Figure 6.8. Laboratory-Fabricated Provisional.   6.10.3.2.  Clinically  Fabricated  Provisional. T he dentist will seat a tem porary cap onto the abutment in the patient’s m outh. The cap is then adjusted to the prope r length.

Position an d attach temporary cy linders onto the abutment replicas, using gold screws or guide  pins. Adjust the occlusion and elim inate all lateral and protrusive interferen ces. At this point, roughen the m odified temporary cylinder to enhance the bond with the resin. Apply heat-cured or self-cured acrylic resin or composite resin to the temporary cylinders. Check the resin for occlusal, lateral interferences, and esthetics. Be sure to clean the acces s holes, thus enabling the  guide pin o r gold screws to be removed and replaced easily. Finish and polish the provisional restoration. 6.10.4.2. For a screw-retained, cast framework provisional: 6.10.4.2.1.

Procedures for Single-Tooth, Cemented Restoration: AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 6.11.1. For a single-tooth im plant,  a hex-shaped abutm ent is used  to prevent rotation of the restoration. The dentis t will use an abutm ent positioned 2 to  3 mm below the tissue to prevent a  metal band from showing when the restoration is inserted.  6.11.2. There are three m ethods to  fabricate a cem ent-retained, single-tooth implant—a ceramic cap restoration (paragraph 6.12), a gold cylinder  restoration (paragraph  6.13), and a burnout cap restoration (paragraph 6.14). 6.11.3. All of these m ethods  involve first fabricating a m aster  cast with an abutment replica in place. When making the m aster cast, soft tissue s ilicone material is app lied around the abutm ent  m aterial into the adja cent te eth a reas. The so ft replica. Care m ust be taken to not run siliconetissue m aterial will allo w for accurate ging ival  shaping of the restoration. After the casts are fabricated, articulate the master and opposing casts on a semiadjustable articulator. 6.12.  Ceramic  Cap  Restoration. Ceramic caps (Figure 6.9) are m ade of densely sintered alum inous porcelain an d offer the esthetic ad vantages of the all ceram ic crow n. Ceram ic caps are available in different lengths, and they are selected based on the interarch space available for the restoration.  Figure 6.9. Cement-Retained, Ceramic-Cap Implant.   6.12.1. Ceramic-Cap Preparations: 6.12.1.1. Seat the appropriate ceram ic cap (for exam ple, CeraOne®) onto the abutm ent replica, check for necessary occlusal space,  and evaluate the axial inclination (Figure 6.9-A and -B). It  may be necessary to reduce areas on the ceramic cap to provide room for a layer of porcelain to be applied to achieve the cont ours of the complete d restoration. If reduction of the cap is required, use diam ond burs on a high-speed, water- cooled handpiece to avoid fracturing the porcelain.  6.12.1.2. The minimum thickness of the ceram ic cap must be at least 0.5 mm after adjustm ents are m ade.

Before applying porcelain to the  6.12.2. Porcelain Application: 6.12.2.1. Porcelain that is compatible with an aluminous core must be used to layer the ceramic cap. Conventional m etal-ceramic porcelains cannot  be used with ceram ic caps due to the incompatibility with the alum inous porcelain  core. S tandard procedures for porcelain application described in Chapte r 2 are used to com plete the  porcelain buildup (F igure 6.9-C). For firing tim es and temperatures , be sure to  f ollow the  m anufacturer’s d irections of  the  porcelain system used.  6.12.2.2. After the porcelain application, contour and glaze the restoration. It is now ready to be disinfected and sent to the dentist for insertion (Figure 6.9-D). 6.13. Gold Cylinder Restoration. Gold cylinders are a cast-to pattern used mainly in the posterior area. Wax is applied directly to the  gold cylinder to for m a substructu re, which will b e cast us ing a noble  metal-ceramic alloy.  6.13.1. Substructure Wax-Up:  6.13.1.1. Place the gold cylinde r onto the abutment replica and secure it with a guide pin. W ax a metal-ceramic substructure to the gold cylinde r, using the techniques in Chapter 2. The wax should extend down to the chamfer on the gold cylinder with a minimum thickness of 0.5 mm.  6.13.1.2. The com pleted wax-up is then invested, technique. If debubblizer is used, paint it only onto the wax pattern  because debubblizer on the gold cylinder m ay cause m etal casting flash. Take  care to avoid trappi ng bubbles inside the gold cylinder when investing. Any bubbles inside  the gold cylinder after casting are difficult to identify. Bubbles on the seating surf ace of the gol d cylinder can give false read ings or abrade the plastic, when seating against the abutment replica. Also take extreme care to avoid abrading or damaging the abutment-cylinder surface when removing bubbles.  cast, and finished, using the lost wax 6.13.2. Porcelain Application. Conventional metal-ceramic porcelain systems and techniques are used to build up and complete the restoration.  After porcelain is applie d, contoured, glazed, and polished, the restoration is ready for insertion. 6.14. Burnout Cap Restoration. An acrylic res in cap can also be  used to fit over the abutm ent. The procedures for the burnout cap are very sim ilar to the gold cylinder m ethod. The burnout cap is first seated onto the abutm ent replica (Figure 6.10-A ). Next, complete a  metal ceramic substructure wax-up over the burnout cap (Figure 6.10-B ). This wax-up is ca st, using conventional lo st wax techniques, and porcelain is applied as described in the gold cylinder method above (Figure 6.10-C through -F). The disadvantage of the burnout cap is the absence of the machined fit with the abutment, which is present in the gold cylinder m ethod. One advantage of the burnout expensive than other methods. 6.15. Procedures for Screw-Retained Restorations:  cap is that it is less6.15.1. Overview (Figure 6.11): 6.15.1.1.

The procedures for screw-reta ined restorations are very si milar to the procedures for  making ce ment-retained restorati ons, except for a channel to allow access to the s crew that retains the r estoration. With screw-retained restorations, it is essen tial the implant fixtures be properly angled so the access hole for the screw is in an acceptable position. The screw opening must be on the lingual for anterior teeth or on the occlusal for posterior teeth. If the angle of the implant is not ideal, an angulated or custom  abutment is used to correct the angle or to better position the screw access hole. As with the cem ent-retained restoration, a master cast must first be fabricated with the abutm ent replicas in plac e. It is also a good idea  to incorporate the soft tissue cast when fabricating the master cast (paragraph 6.9). 6.15.2. Screw-Retained, Cast-To Substructure. Articulate the m aster and opposing casts on a ite registration. Evaluate the vertical space to semiadjustable articulator, using an occlusal bdetermine which size gold cylinder will best fit. Before placing  the gold cylinder, ensure thesurface of the abutm ent replica is clean  for ac curate seating. Attach  a gold  cylinder to each abutment replica, using a guide pin (Figure 6.11-A). (Usually, the 10 mm guide pin is sufficient in length.)  6.15.2.1. Substructure Wax-Up: 6.15.2.1.1. When waxing the fram ework, keep in m ind  that it is necessa ry to support all porcelain applied to the framework during firing cycles by cast m etal. Therefore, the screw  access opening will nee d to be line d with a la yer of m etal. Accomplish this by creating a  resin chimney around the guide pin. Build the  resin around the guide pi n up to a point that will be slightly above the occlusal surface (Figure 6.11-B).  6.15.2.1.2. After the resin cure s, remove the guide pin and gr ind in the occlusion until the resin ch imney is no lon ger above the occl usal surface (Fig ure 6.11-C).  Then wax up the substructure, f ollowing all gu idelines prev iously given  in Chapter 2 for m etal-ceramic restorations (Figure 6.11-D and -E).   AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 6.11. Screw-Retained, Cast-To Restoration. 211  6.15.2.1.3. When cuttin g back the wax-up, use the soft tiss ue portion o f the cast to ensure  the m etal collar will b e subgingiv al (Figu re 6 .11-F). In addition, all  portions of the gold  cylinder, except the chamfer, need to be c overed in wax. T he porcelain will on ly bond to cast metal, not the gold  cylinder. T he metal  of the gold cylinder does not for m a n oxide  212  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 layer, which prevents a porcelain-to-m etal  bond. Use m agnification to ensure all wax is removed from the chamfer portion of the gold cylinder (Figure 6.11-G).  6.15.2.1.4. When fabricating a FPD pattern before investing the substructure, check the fit of the wax-up on the abutm ent replicas. Use one  gold screw to attach one abutm ent and then look to ensure the opposite end is fully seated (Figure 6.11-H). Repeat this step for the other abutment. If rocking occurs, cut the wax-up, atta ch both abutm ents, and then reseal the cut area. 6.15.2.2. Investing and Casting: 6.15.2.2.1. Use conventional spruing techniques to produce im plant substructures. If debubblizer is used,  paint  it only onto the wax pattern.  Debubblizer on the gold cylinder may cause m etal castin g f lash. Be sure to f ollow m anufacturer’s dire ctions f or m ixing investment and burnout procedures.  6.15.2.2.2. Cast by using the norm al metal ceramic casting technique. Keep in mind that the melting range of the alloy used m ust be lowe r than the m elting range of the gold cylinder. For this reason, a noble alloy is used. Nonpreci ous alloys should not be used to cast over gold cylinders. 6.15.2.3. Finishing the Substructure: for bubbles, fins, or  any defects. Pay 6.15.2.3.1. Remove all investm ent from the casting  carefully to avoid dam age to the gold cylinder. Usually, the investment will fall out of the internal portion of the gold cylinder by tapping on the sprue. If sandblastin g is nece ssary, protect the gold cylinder with wax or protection caps.  6.15.2.3.2. Use m agnification to inspect the casting particular attention to the gold cylinder seating surface and screw access hole.  6.15.2.3.3. After the go ld cylinder and screw access  hole is clean, seat the fram ework onto the cast and check the fit (Figure 6.11-I). If necessary, an FPD can be cut with a disc through the pontic, reattached to the abutm ent replicas  with guide pins, sealed  together with resin, and soldered.  6.15.2.3.4. After a precise fit to the abutm ent replicas is established, attach a protection cap with a guide pin before proceeding to metal finishing (Figure 6.11-J). Always use protection caps to p rotect the internal and sporcelain bearing surfaces in the same manner as any porcelain fused to metal crown Figure 6.11-K). At this point, FPD frameworks should be tried in the mouth to check for proper fit. 6.15.2.4. Applying Porcelain (Figure 6.11-L through -N). First, prepare the framework in the manner prescribed by the  porcelain manufacturer. Porcelain application is essentially the same for implants as conv entional metal ceramic crowns.  EXCEPTION: Clean all po rcelain from inside th e s crew access  holes and gold cylind er seats before firing and use protection caps while grinding porcelain during contouring procedures.  eating surf aces of the gold cylinder. Now, finish the 6.15.3. Screw-Retained, Castable Substructure (Figure 6.12): 6.15.3.1. A common type of screw-retained, castable  substructure is kn own as the U.C.L.A. abutment. The U.C.L.A. abutm ent is a plastic patte rn that serves as bo th the abutment and the gold cylinder and is screwed di(Figure 6.12-A). The U.C.L.A. abutment has a 0.5 mm  collar on  the plastic pattern that serves as the metal porcelain junction. Fabrication procedures are essentially the same as the cast-to screw-retained implant.  rectly to the implant fixture AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 6.12. Screw-Retained, Castable Substructure. 213   6.15.3.2. Start by fabricating the master cast, using a fixture replica versus the abutment replica. Articulate the completed master and opposing casts on a suitable articulator.  6.15.3.3. Next, wax the substructure following guidelines for m etal ceram ic substructures (Figure 6.12-B). Be sure to extend the screw access hole to the height of the occlusal surface to give support to the porcelain when firing.  6.15.3.4. Cast the wax-up, using a porcelain com patible m etal (Figure 6.12-C). Prepare the casting for porcelain, then apply, fire, and contour  porcelain to the nece ssary contours (Figure 6.12-D through -G). Ensure the screw access hole is free from porcelain or any other material. 6.15.3.5. The last step is to finish or m ill the s urface of the restoration  that seats against th e implant fixture. When a castable substructure is used, the surface that se ats against the implant fixture is not as smooth as a machined abutment supplied by an implant manufacturer.  tion of the 6.15.3.6. These two surfaces m ust have intim ate contact for successful retenrestoration. The best way to acco mplish this is to use an electric discharge machine (EDM). The EDM uses electric curren t to s park erode the surface o f the casting  until it h as a sm ooth intimate contact with  a im plant fixture rep lica. Another m ethod is  called lapping. It uses grinding compound and s mall hand drill to lap  or grind th e surface of the casting  against an  implant fixture replica until it is smooth and has intimate contact with the fixture replica. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 214  6.16.  Procedures  for  Implant-Retained  Removable  Prosthesis.  Several different types of implant devices can retain rem ovable prostheses. Common devices are the bar  and clip attachm ent (paragraph 6.17 and Figure 6.13), m agnets, and ball attachm ent. The common number of i mplants used to retain a denture is two. The fabrication procedures for prostheses that use these attachments are very similar. 6.17. Bar and Clip Retained Overdenture. One popular type of plastic ba r and clip attachm ent for a removable prosthesis is called the Hader bar. A Hader Bar is cast in to metal and uses a plastic retaining clip that can be easily replaced when necessary. The bar and  clip normally uses two im plants—usually one in each  canine area, using a standard abutm ent and gold cylinder with a bar connecting the gold cylinders. L ocated insid e the res in  on the tissu e side  of  th e dentu re is  a pla stic c lip tha t r etains the denture when seated. 6.17.1. Custom Tray and Master Cast. First, make a custom tray (Figure 6.13-A) by following the steps outlined in paragraph 6.8. Using the custom  tray, the dentist will take a final impression with im pression copings on the abutments (Figure 6.13-B ). Attach  abutm ent replicas to the impression copings and  then pour and trim  the final im pression (Fig ure 6.13-C).  (Additional guidance on the master cast is available in paragraph 6.9.) 6.17.2. Baseplate and Occlusion Rims. Attach gold cylinders to the abutment replicas, using long guide pins. Block out around each a butment to prevent the baseplat e resin from  attaching to the gold cylinders. Make a standard baseplate with the areas around the gold  cylinders open (Figure 6.13-D). When m aking the occlusion rim s, leave th e area around the guide pi ns open to prevent the wax from  interfering with acc ess to the guide pins  (Figure 6.13-E). Use standard dim ensions for the occlusion rims (Volume 1, Chapter 7, Section 7H). 6.17.3.  Articulation. Articu late the  master cast and  interocclusal registration. It may be necessary to use shorter guide pins to  eliminate interferences with the opposing cast. 6.17.4. Trial Denture: opposing, using the face bow and6.17.4.1. Follow standard tooth arrangem ent proce dures for the desired type of setup. If interference is encountered with the guide pins, the tooth must be altered or omitted for the try-in (Figure 6.13-F). If a tooth is a ltered for the try-in, a replacement tooth will be s et during the final wax-up when guide pins ar e no longer used. The com pleted setup will then be tried in the patient’s mouth and evaluated for function and esthetic requirements.  6.17.4.2. Make any necessary changes to the setup  using the dentist guidance from the try-in (Figure 6.13-G). In order to m aintain the relationship of the se tup to the abutm ents, make a  silicone facial m atrix of the final setup. Be su re to m ake grooves in th e land areas of the cast before making the matrix to help reorient it to the cast later.  6.17.5. Bar Fabrication:  6.17.5.1. First, attach the gold cylinders to the m aster cast, using guide pins (Figure 6.13-H). Cut a piece  of  plastic bar to fit between the  gold cylinders passively. Keep the plastic bar straight to allow for easy seating of the clip.  6.17.5.2. Position the p lastic bar a m inimum of 2 mm a bove the tis sue to allo w for easy cleaning. Attach to the gold cylinder with inlay wax (Figure 6.13-I).  6.17.5.3. Flow the wax over and around the gold cylinder to blend in the bar attachment. Sprue, invest, and cast the completed wax-up (Figure 6.13-J).  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  215 6.17.5.4. Finish the casting to the polished stage w ithout altering the shape of the bar. W hen finishing, use protection  caps on the gold cylind ers to prevent dam age to the seatin g surfaces (Figure 6.13-K). Attach the fini shed bar to the abutm ents with gold screws and check for an accurate fit (Figure 6.13-L).  Figure 6.13. Bar and Clip Overdenture Procedures.  216  Figure 6.13. Continued. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  6.17.6. Denture Completion: 6.17.6.1. Position the fabrication p lastic clip o n  the bar and adjust the clip to follow the contours of the tissue when the clip is fully seated onto the bar (Figure 6.13-M).  6.17.6.2. Seat the clip and apply stone to stone separa tor to the anterior portion of the cast. Mix and flow stone around the bar to blockout the entire bar, leaving the clip exposed and flush with the top of the block out  (Figure 6.13-N). This allows the clip  to be picked up in the resin when processing the denture base without engaging any resin around the bar.  6.17.6.3. Remove the teeth from the trial denture wax-up and seat them into the silicone matrix made earlier (paragraph 6.17.4.2). Seat the m atrix onto the indexes in the  master cast land area and flow the wax, attaching the teeth to the cast (Figure 6.13-O). Fill in all space with wax and contour the denture base to complete the final wax-up (Figure 6.13-P).  6.17.6.4. Verify the occlusion and then proceed  to  process the dentu re base, using standard  processing techniques (Figure 6.13-Q). When deflasking, be careful to avoid damaging the bar.  6.17.6.5. Remount the denture to the  articulation and equilibrate a ny processing errors. Finish and polish the denture using conventional technique s. Remove the fabrication clip and install the final retentive clip. This f inal step is us ually completed during inse rtion of the completed denture (Figure 6.13-R).   AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  217 Chapter 7 SPECIAL PROSTHESES   Section 7A—Treatment Appliances 7.1. Types of Basic Orthopedic Appliances: 7.1.1.  Introduction. The basic orthopedic appliance has  many different nam es, including night guard, maxillary orthopedic appliance, occlusal orthopedic applianc e, and occlusal splint. A basic orthopedic appliance can  be m ade of hard or soft  material for either the m axillary or m andibular arch. The h ard app liance m ay be  fabricated, using self-curing  orthodontic acrylic, heat-cured acrylic, lig ht-cured acrylic, m icrowave-cured  acrylic, or vacuum -formed plastic. The softappliance is  usually fabricated, usin g m outhguard  material (0.15-inch thick). This section will describe the self-curing, sprinkle-on technique. 7.1.2. Patient Treatment:   7.1.2.1. These appliances can be used to (1) stabilize the teeth, (2) treat tem poromandibular disorders and provide pain relief, (3) increase  occlusal vertical dim ension, and (4) reduce an excessive rate of tooth wear.  7.1.2.2. The basic orthopedic appliance m ay be fa bricated with the m andible in different positions. T hese pos itions can rang e f rom centric  relation to any po sition f orward of  centr ic relation that can be tole rated by the  patient. The centric relation position of the m andible (or terminal hinge position) provides for the most repeatable position of the mandible.  7.1.2.3. A basic orthopedic appliance can be a passive appliance that uses a flat surface parallel to the occlusal plane or an active appliance that usually has occlusal indentations approximately 1 mm deep guiding the mandible to a predetermined position on the appliance.  7.1.2.4. Most basic orthopedic applia nces are m ade with sim ultaneous, even contact of all posterior stamps cusps and incisal edges of th e opposing arch in the ce ntric position provided by the dentist. These appliances are usually fabricated with a m utually protected occlusion, which provides for a anterior guide  plane th at acts as a guiding ra mp to disclud e all potential posterior eccentric contacts. 7.1.3. Procedures for Construction of a Basic Orthopedic Appliance (Self-Cured Acrylic): 7.1.3.1. Mount Casts:  7.1.3.1.1. Before the appliance can be m ade, the  casts must be m ounted on an articulator with the desired mandibular position and a sp ace separating the opposing teeth. For specific procedures on articulating, refer to Volume 1, Chapter 6.  7.1.3.1.2. Although it is not absolutely essential for the maxillary cast to be mounted using a facebow transfer, it will provid e a m ore accura te relation ship of eccentric con tacts and centric contacts if the vertical opening is to be changed.  7.1.3.1.3. Lateral records may also be used to adjust the horizontal condylar guidance. If the  dentist provides these records, you will b e able to p rogram the ar ticulator to s imulate the mandibular movements of the patient. If these  records are not provided, the dentist m ust be willing to accept some degree of error in these positions and make the necessary adjustments in the m outh. If the dentist does not provide a  facebow transfer, he o r she must provide an interocclusal record of the sam e thicknes s and relationship desired for the finished 218  appliance. (Be sure to tighten the s et screw on the incisal pin to prevent the occlusal vertical dimension from moving accidentally.) AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 e should extend 0.5 mm beyond the height of 7.1.3.2. Survey and Design. Once the casts have been properly mounted on the articulator with the desired am ount of occlusal vertical dim ension opening, the next step is to survey the maxillary cast (Figure 7.1-A). Survey the buccal and lingual surfaces of the posterior teeth with a carbon marker. The design of the applianccontour on the buccal of the posterior teeth  and 1 to 1.5 mm below the incisal edge along the labial surfaces of the anterior teeth. The lingual design should be  a horseshoe shape that covers the rugae. 7.1.3.3.  Block  Out  Undercuts. Using baseplate wax, block  out undercuts along the lingual gingival crevice, em brasures, m argins of restor ations, deep occlusal grooves, and prom inent rugae. Apply utility wax, following the design al ong the facial surfaces of the teeth  and inside the palate to establish the border of the appliance (Figure 7.1-B). Seal the utility wax to the cast and flatten the top edge of the wax , just expos ing the d esign line. Th e utility wax  will help control the flow of acrylic and establish a definite border to the appliance.  Figure 7.1. Basic Orthopedic Appliance.  7.1.3.4.  Set  the  Guide  Table  for  Anterior  Guidance. Set the  inc isal guide table  to ensu re there is adequate space for acrylic in lateral and protrusive excursions.  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  219 e upper m ember of the articulator in 7.1.3.4.1. Loosen the centric locks and place thprotrusive. Rotate the incisal  guide table until the incisal gui de pin separates the anterior teeth 1 to 2 mm at the cl osest point (Figure 7.1-C). Tighten the set screw on the gui de table at this position. 7.1.3.4.2. Place the upp er m ember into a lateral ex cursion. Adjust the appropriate incisal guide table wing until th e guide pin separates the posterior  teeth 1 to 2 mm at the  closest point. Lock the guide table set sc rew at this po sition. Repeat this step f or the othe r lateral excursion. 7.1.3.5. Apply Resin. Orthodontic resin provides the best a ppliance and is easiest to control. Apply a tinfoil substitute to the maxillary arch and opposing occlusal surfaces. To minimize the shrinkage and distortion that always accompanies the polymerization of acrylic resin, apply the resin in sections (Figure 7.1-D),  using the sprinkle-on technique. The first three applications of acrylic provide a m inimum thickness of resin mandibular teeth.  and m ust not be allowed to contact the ed together, sprinkle the resin for the 7.1.3.5.1. Sprinkle the polym er on one of the posterio r sections to include only the occlusal and lingual surfaces of the teeth an d tissue. Moisten the powder with monomer and keep it moist to prevent porosity. Close the  articulator and check  to see that th e mandibular cusps do not contact res in. Allow each s ection to cu re before proceeding to  another. To help  reduce porosity in the cured appliance, place the cast in a closed container with a monomer-soaked cotton roll while the curing process takes place.  7.1.3.5.2. After the three sections have been joinocclusal portion of the applian ce. Moisten the  previously f ormed base with m onomer and sprinkle resin onto the entire occlusal surface.  7.1.3.5.3. Build up the resin thick enough so opposi ng cusp and incisal edges will contact when the articulator is closed. Let the resi n become doughy and then close the articulator into centric position. Re peatedly close the articulator a nd move the upper m ember through lateral and protrusive excursions while the resin is still in the doughy state (Figure 7.1-E).  7.1.3.5.4. In the anterior region, the  goal is to create an inclined  plane that discludes all potential posterior eccentric c ontacts. With the incis al guide table p roperly set (paragraph 7.1.3.4), this should be easily achieved.  7.1.3.5.5. When all the imprints have been establishe d, close the articulator and place it in a  closed container; for example, a small plastic bucket with lid. Allow the resin to poly merize according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. 7.1.3.6. Refining Contacts:  7.1.3.6.1. The occlusal contacts must be refined through identifica tion of the various imprints and adjustm ent. Good m ethods for di stinguishing between ce ntric and eccentric contacts use red and black articulating film.  7.1.3.6.2. Place a piece of red articu lating film on the occlusal  surface and gently tap th e articulator closed un til red m arks are readil y visible on the acrylic . Next, use the black articulating film on the occlusal surface, fo llowing the imprints m ade, to identify the eccentric contacts. The objective of adjusting the centric contact areas is to reduce the broad  base contact to a smaller point contact.  7.1.3.6.3. Only the m andibular buccal cusp tip ipermitted to remain. Care m ust be taken when reducing the  broad base  contacts to  avoid ndentations at the greatest depth are 220  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 grinding through the acrylic and damaging the cast. If holes are ground through into the cast, they cannot be accurately repaired because a portion of the cast is now missing.  7.1.3.6.4. In lateral and protrusive move ments, the anterior bite plane bears the functional load for the appliance. Theref ore, all posterio r eccentric co ntacts m ust be elim inated and anterior guidance “ground in” to produce a smooth, gliding motion. When fully adjusted, the appliance should hold the shim stock between the appliance and all mandibular buccal cusps in centric occlusion only. W hen the shim  stock is pulled th rough the anterior region, it should be able to drag across the mandibular anteriors in centric occlusion.  7.1.3.6.5. In the eccentric positions, the posteriorin and the anterior should only cause a posterior  separation of 1 to 2  mm. The contacts should appear like those in Figure 7.1-F.  cusps should not touch the acrylic res7.1.3.7. Bulk Finishing. Most of the finishing should be done while the appliance is on the cast to minimize distortion or warpage. Remove the utility wax from the borders of the appliance. If necessary, boiling water m ay be used to elim inate the wax, but care must be taken to avoid warping the appliance. Reduce the overall bul k of the appliance un til you obtain a uniform  thickness of approxim ately 1 to  2 mm. Contour the resin along scalloped fashion approximately 1 mm thick (Figur e 7.1-G). Be careful not to elim inate any of the centric stops or disturb the anterior guidance. 7.1.3.8. Completion. Carefully remove the appliance f rom the cast by g ently lifting from the posterior area first to allow the appliance to disengage the undercuts on the facial of the anterior teeth. The acrylic resin along th e facial should extend 0.5 mm beyond  the height of contour of the posterior teeth and 1 to 1.5 mm  below the incisal edge of the anterior teeth. Lightly pumice and polish the occlusal areas and avoid elim inating any of the contacts incorporated into the appliance. Exercise extreme caution not to overheat th e resin and warp the appliance during  pumicing and polishing. Clean and disinfect the appliance before delivery (Figure 7.1-H). the facial contours in a 7.2. Soft Acrylic Mandibular Orthopedic Appliance. A basic orthopedic appliance using soft resilient mouthguard m aterial is essentiall y fabricated in the sam e m anner as the therm oplastic vinyl m outh protector discussed in paragraph 7.4. The only significan t differences are that a mandibular cast is often used and dentists often desire the  material to extend as far as possibl e into the posterior lingual f lange area. 7.3.  Other  Basic  Orthopedic  Appliance  Designs. Depending on treatment needs, dentis ts will occasionally request d ifferent design s for oral o rthopedic devices.  Such devices m ay include an terior bite p lanes, m andibular bila teral p osterior splint s, and an terior repos itioning dev ices. Consu lt th e prescribing dentist for specific fabrication details. 7.4. Fabricating a Thermoplastic Vinyl Mouth Protector. In the fabrication of  a vinyl thermoplastic mouth protector, the dentist will fu rnish an alginate im pression of  the patien t’s m axillary a rch. The dental technician will perform the following steps (Figure 7.2): 7.4.1. Pour a master cast in artificial stone. 7.4.2. After separating  the cas t from the im pression, draw the ou tline of the m outhguard on the cast with a soft lead pencil. Trim the cast as close to the outline as practical. (The thickness of the  base should  not exceed  6 mm ). Do not create unde rcuts on the cast that  would interfere with removal of the m outh protector. The reason for trim ming the cast as sp ecified is to  facilitate the vacuum formation and m inimize stretching and thin ning of the vinyl plastic during the m olding (Figure 7.2-A). A large, oversized cast would result in a thin m outh protector with poor serviceability. At this time, allow the cast to dry because air will not pass through a cast saturated with water. Print the patient’s name on the cast. 221 AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005   Figure 7.2. Mouth Protector Fabrication.   7.4.3. Determine the exact m olding procedure used. To  some extent, this depends on the type of equipment used. The directions furnished by the  manufacturer should produce satisfactory results. Most commercial m achines consist of a perforated  plate co nnected to a  source of vacuum , an electrical heating element, and a metal frame the vinyl plastic blank is clamped into. The molding procedure in general is as follows: 7.4.3.1. Clamp a vinyl plastic sheet in the frame and place it und er the heater . Estim ate the molding temperature by the am ount the sheet of  vinyl plastic m aterial  “sags” as it softens. Excessive s oftening of the m aterial will resu lt  in undesirab le stretch ing and thinnin g of the mouth protector. Sharp reproductions of the surface detail are not necessary. 7.4.3.2. Dip the dry cast in water for 2 or 3 seconds and p lace in position on the perforated  plate. This wetting provides enough surface moisture to prevent the vinyl plastic from sticking, but it does not affect the passage of air through the cast. 7.4.3.3. Turn the vacuum on and move the fram e to the molding position. Hold in this position until the vinyl plastic is completely adapted to the cast (Figure 7.2-B). 7.4.3.4. Turn off the vacuum  and release the clamp on the fram e. Set the cast with the m outh protector aside until it cools thoroughly. 222  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.4.3.5. After cooling, trim  excess vinyl  plastic m aterial away with  scissors or a warm knife  blade (Figure 7.2-C). Remove the mouth protecto r from the cast and polish the periphery with hing by lightly flam ing the m outh protector pumice. Clear any cloudy areas caused by polisover a Bunsen burner or with an alcohol torch. Clean and disinfect the m outh protector and replace it on the cast until it is delivered to the patient (Figure 7.2-D). 7.5. Sleep Apnea Appliance. Sleep apnea is a condition in which airflow is restricted, causing breathing interruptions during sleep. In some cases, an ainterruptions and allow air to freely p ass into the lungs. The sleep apnea appliance repositions the lower jaw and tongue during sleep to prevent the airw ay from closing. To fabricate th e appliance, the dentist first takes diagnostic impressions an d a bite registration with the m andible in approximately 75 percent protrusive and with a 10-mm incisal opening. ppliance can be m ade to reduce the chances of 7.5.1. Constructing a Sleep Apnea Appliance (Figure 7.3): rproximal undercuts on the 7.5.1.1.  Duplicate  the  Master  Casts. First, block out any intemaster casts and then provide a set of working casts, using standard duplicating procedures. 7.5.1.2. Design and Articulate the Casts. Extend the design to the attached gingiva area on the facial su rface of the m axillary and m andibular casts. The m andibular cast’s lingual design should extend below the gingival m argin, but not into major undercut areas. The lingual of the maxillary may be a full palate or horseshoe design. Trim the bases of the working cast as close to the  desig n cast as p ossible. This will f acilitate the f lasking proc ess la ter. Ar ticulate the  working casts using the bite registration provided (Figure 7.3-A). 7.5.1.3. Wax Up the Appliance. Apply a uniform 2 to 3 mm th ickness of baseplate wax to the design of the maxillary and mandibular cast. Fill the interocclusal space between the maxillary and mandibular arches from the first premolar to the second molar. This will leave a n opening in the anterior area from canine to canine (Figure 7.3-B). 7.5.1.4. Flasking:  7.5.1.4.1. Because of the vertical height of the wax-up, flasking m ust be accomplished in a jumbo flask or two m axillary flasks combined. When using two m axillary flasks, combine two lower s ections with  one cente r section b etween them . Half -fill th e cente r an d lower section of the flask with flasking stone. Adapt the flasking stone into the tongue space of the wax-up and then subm erge the wax-up into the  flask covering the entire wax up with stone (Figure 7.3-C).  7.5.1.4.2. Smooth the surface of the lower half flaski ng before the stone sets completely and then apply separator to the stone (Figure 7.3-D).  7.5.1.4.3. Mix the flasking stone for the upper h alf flasking. First, fill th e areas arou nd the cast. Then fill the remaining lower flask section with stone and invert  it onto the lower half flasking. Excess stone should be visible between the lower and upper portions of the flask to ensure the flask is full (Figure 7.3-E). Allow the stone to set before proceeding to boilout. 7.5.1.5. Boilout. Place the flask in boiling water for 5 minutes to soften the wax, but not melt it into the sto ne. Separate the flask and rem ove as much wax as possibl e. Place the m old back into boiling water to rem ove the rem aining  wax. Scrub and rinse the m old thoroughly to remove all residues (F igure 7.3-F). Apply a runny m ix of separator to the m old while it is still warm. Then tip the mold on end to allow excess separator to drain. 7.5.1.6. Packing and Curing. Use a soft heat cured acrylic for the appliance. The acrylic is soft when warm and hardens as it cools. This allows  the appliance to flex over the contours of the  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  223 vices. Mix the m aterial according to the oral cavity without any other retention demanufacturer’s directions and pour it into the lower half m old (Figure  7.3-G). Trial pack the mold several tim es to be sure it is densely pa cked (Figure 7.3-H). Place the m old into a flask carrier and cure it according to the manufacturer’s directions. 7.5.1.7.  Deflasking  and  Finishing. Re move all stone from  around the cast, leaving the appliance in place (Figu re 7.3-I). Place the cast in  warm water to soften the acry lic and then  gently remove the appliance from the cast. Be careful because the material is more susceptible to tearing w hen it is in a softened state. Before  finishing, soak the appl iance in cold water to keep the acrylic hard while grinding on it. Smooth any rough areas and trim the appliance to the design line. Pumice and polish as usual (Figure 7.3-J).   Figure 7.3. Sleep Apnea Appliance.   224  7.6. Surgical Splints: AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.6.1.  Types  of  Splints. A splint is an applia nce, either  ri gid o r f lexible, us ed to imm obilize displaced or movable dentition. In the treatment of certain types of jaw fractur es, the oral surgeon first reduces the fracture by bringi ng the displaced bone segments into normal alignment and then fixes them in position by the m ethod best suited to  the patient’s needs. Later, when healing of the  fragments has progressed suffici ently, the fixation apparatus is rem oved and a splint m ay be  inserted in the patient’s mouth until healing is completed. (In some instances, the splint may serve as the fixation apparatus from the beginning of treatment.) 7.6.2. Variations in Splint Design: 7.6.2.1. Splints are made in different forms to deal with the variety of  problems encountered in treatment. The dentis t will pre scribe the req uirements the splin t must satisf y. The dental technician must have a broad kno wledge of the principles involve d in splint fabrication so the basic technique can be modified to meet any of these requirements. 7.6.2.2. Splints can be m ade of acrylic resin or cas t metal. Those made of metal are less bulky than those m ade of acrylic resin. One advantag esin splin t is  that it isradiolucent. Periodic radiographs can be m ade through it to check the progress of healing without removing the splint from  the patient’s m outh. This paragraph covers the fabrication of  one simple case of each type, including examples of modifications. e of  an acrylic r7.6.3.

Keep the wire a s close as p ossible to the gingiva without impinging on soft tissue. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.4. Acrylic Resin Fixation Splint. 225   7.6.3.3.2. Carry each w ire around onto th e facial and ling ual su rfaces of the teeth as far forward as the center of the next tooth. Bend the ends of the wire laterally at right angles and cut off the e xcess, leaving about 12 mm jutting  out facially and lingually. Do not adapt the wires too close to the facial a nd lingual surfaces of the teeth. Th ere should be a slight space (about 1 mm) that will allow the splint material to flow around the wires, embedding them. 7.6.3.3.3. Tack the hinges into position with sticky wax. 7.6.3.4. Wax-Up and Flasking: 7.6.3.4.1. Apply two thicknesses of baseplate wax, sealing their edges to the design on the cast. Make the outer surface flat and smooth (Figure 7.4-C). 7.6.3.4.2. Grind the incisal or occlusal thirds of the stone teeth flat an d even with the top surface of the wax.

They are als o used when the patien t does not have com plete dentures that can be modified for use as a fixation splint. 7.6.4.2. A splint consists of record bases and occlus ion rims processed in acrylic resin (Figure 7.5). First, the dentist modifies  the rims to m atch the patient’s  occlusal vertical dimension by orienting the wax rim s in centric relation. Next,  a V-shaped notch is carv ed into the occlusal surface of o ne of the o cclusion rim s. A V-shap ed pro jection is th en added to  th e opposing occlusion rim to provide a means of positively orienting the two edentulous arches.

Specifications and Laboratory Procedures for Cast Arch Bars:  7.7.1. An arch bar is a splint-like device used to  hold jaw fragments together in proper alignm ent in a patient’s mouth. The need for such a device most often arises because of injury.  7.7.2. A cast arch bar is a band of m etal cast to fit around a  dental arch, against the facial surfaces of remaining teeth. The bar has a number of lugs that protrude from its gingival border.  7.7.3. Arch bars are frequently used in pairs, one maxillary and one mandibular. Each bar is wired in place on an arch, using rem aining natural t eeth for anchorage. The two bars are then held  together by rubber bands or heavy duty, silk thread. The idea is not only to hold a jaw’s fragments together with the ba r, but to stabilize a broken jaw against one that is not broken. This inter-arch stabilization is essential if the broken jaw is to heal in good occlusio n with its opponent. The purpose of these specifications is to standardize construction procedures so the resulting arch bars will fulfill the requirements of oral surgeons and best serve the needs of the patient.  7.7.4. Because m any patien ts are hospitalized whileconstruction procedures should be given top prreasonable means.  aw aiting the construction of the bars,iority and the fabrication expedited by all  7.8.  Impressions  and  Jaw  Relationship  Record  for  Cast  Arch  Bars. As always, the dentist is obligated to make the best im pression possible. Making an im pression of a patien t’s fractured jaw is  difficult. Such patients are in pa in and have extrem e difficulty ope ning their m ouths wide enough to accommodate impression trays. When appropriate, an interocclusal record should accompany the case. 7.9. Construction Specifications for Cast Arch Bars: 7.9.1. Bar:  kness and width to resist distortion or 7.9.1.1. The bar m ust have adequate, uniform thicbreakage.  7.9.1.2. The gingival-occlusal width should equal 2 to 2 1/2 mm with a faciolingual thickness 1 to 1 1/2 mm. Use the larger dim ensions when the arch bar will be fabricated using gold alloys. Base metal alloy is stronger and can be a little less bulky. Build the bar so it has a flat surface in contact with  each tooth.  The bar will traverse the area on the facial su rfaces of the crowns between the contact points and the gingival tissue.  228  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.9.1.3. The gingival edge of the bar should com e to within 0.5 to 1 mm  of the m idfacial surface junctions of g ingivae and  teeth (Figure 7.6). Hopefully, th e occlusal border of the b ar will be at least 1 mm gingival to the contact points of the teeth to allow easier wiring and better jaw fragment stabilization.   Figure 7.6. Cast Arch Bar Seated on the Working Cast.   7.9.1.4. Extend the bar around the arch in a relativcontouring or festooning. Relie ve the interproxim al areas enough to prevent pressure on interproximal papillae. Arch bars that extend into interproximal areas are very difficult to ligate to teeth because there is not enough working room. ely straight line with no interproxim al 7.9.2.  Occlusal  Rests. Place at least one occlusal rest on  each side of the ar ch. The rests  are essential to help position and support the bar in  the patient’s mouth. The rest may be placed on a  buccal groo ve or on a m arginal ridge area,  depending on where space is available. Mak e absolutely sure the rests do not prevent opposing natural teeth from making contact in MI. 7.9.3. Vertically Oriented Traction Lugs (Hooks):  7.9.3.1. There should be 1 to l 1/2 mm clearance betw een the inner surface of the lug and the gingival tissue under it. In this raised condition a nd paralleling the gingival surface, the dentist should have no trouble wrapping ligature m aterial around opposing lugs. Also, the lug will no t stab into the patient’s cheek.  7.9.3.2. About one lug per tooth is needed. Position th e lugs in the centers of anterior teeth and premolars, favoring the m esial 1/3 of m olar teeth. Place a lug at the distobuccal corner of the most posterior tooth to help m aintain the liga ture wire in proper position during placem ent of the bar.  7.9.3.3. The average length of a lug from  the arch  bar to the tip should be 3 to 4 mm. The lug should be cylindrical with a bead or ball on the tip. No sharp edges or corners should be present to cut ligature material. The lug should be between 1 and 1 1/2 mm in diameter and the junction between the bar and the lug should be of sufficient bulk to eliminate the possibility of breakage when ligature traction is applied. 7.9.4. Denture Base (Figure 7.7):  7.9.4.1. Som etimes, a patient does not have enough stabilize broken jaw segments with a conventional cast ar ch bar. Therefore, a denture base that occludes with opposing teeth can be added to one or more sections of an arch bar to provid e additional stabilization. Plan for a space between the p roximal face of the denture base and the natural teeth rem aining in an arch to AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  229 adjacent too th. The space perm its passage of a ligatu re wire that fastens the arch  bar to the tooth.  7.9.4.2. All facially located flanges should be 3 to  4 mm short of the sulcus. The lingual flange of a mandibular denture base should be 2 to 3 mm short of t he lingual sulcus when the floor of the mouth is active. For those denture base additions that m ight cover the palate, the posterior border of the palate should be short of the vibr ating line. D o not bead or scrape the cast for a posterior palatal seal.  Figure 7.7. Cast Arch Bar With Denture Base Modification.  7.10. Laboratory Procedures for Cast Arch Bars:  7.10.1. Pouring and Designing Casts. Pour casts in vacuu m spatulated dental s tone. Either the dentist draws the design on the cast  or the technician transfers the design from the prescription to the cast. 7.10.2. Blocking Out and Relieving the Master Cast (Figure 7.8): 7.10.2.1. Place 2 thickn esses of 24-gauge wax, 6 to 8  mm wide strip s, over the cas t’s facial attached g ingivae, from the d istal o f the m ost  posterior tooth on one side  of th e arch to th e distal of the m ost posterior to oth on the opposite side. Orient the occlusal border of the wax about 0.5 mm occlusal to the junctio n of tooth  and gingivae on each tooth’s m idfacial surface. Seal the edges of the wax in place securely. 7.10.2.2. Block out the interproxim al area by overfilling it slightly with blockout wax. Be sur e the blockout wax extends from  the occlusal edge  of the relief wax to the occlusal or incisal aspects of the teeth to  prevent the bar from  impinging on the soft tissu e in the in terproximal areas. 7.10.2.3. If the arch bar is going to have an attached  denture base, relieve the cast as prescribed by the dentist (under the proposed denture base retention grid). 7.10.3. Duplicating the Master Cast. Duplicate the master cast in refractory material and wax dip the cast following standard procedures. 230  Figure 7.8. Blockout and Relief of the Master Cast. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  7.10.4. Waxing:   7.10.4.1. Make a gold arch bar a little bulkier than  one made from chrome alloy. Make the bar from 8-gauge half-round wax. Befor e waxing, scra pe the edges to elim inate the sharpness. As previously m entioned, the occlusogingival wi dth should equal 2 1/2 mm and the wax shape about 1 1/4 mm thick.  7.10.4.2. With the flat side toward the teeth, ad apt the wax shape to the facial su rfaces. Make the gingival edge of the wax coincide with threpresented on the refractory cast. Make the vertical lugs of 18 gauge round wax shapes.  7.10.4.3. Dip the tips of the lug patterns in molten wax to form small balls on the ends. Position the shapes relative to to oth surfaces as previ ously described. Do not smash the wax  preforms while they are being placed. Lugs should extend  about 3.5 mm from  the  gingival edge of the bar toward the sulcus.

Do not cut th e sprues of f until polish ing procedu res are a lmost done. If the casting is not supported in some way, it will bend.  Section 7B—Face Form Cast (Moulage) 7.11. Custom-Fitted Mask. Because their faces have unusual shapes, som e aircrew members who use oxygen masks during flying duties cannot wear the standa rd sizes. These people require a custom-fitted mask. The flight sur geon will deter mine when this is  necessary and will reque st the dental f acility to fabricate a f ace form cast. From  a prosthodontic view point, face form  casts can  be essential in m aking maxillofacial prostheses. The face form  cast m ust be  (1) made of artificia l stone, (2 ) free of voids and nodules, and (3) an accurate reproduction of the face. It  must cover the entire facial area from  at least 2 inches above the eyeb rows to at least 2 inches below  the chin and slig htly anterior to the tragu s of the ear. 7.12. Procedures for Making a Face Form Cast:  7.12.1. Before beginning these procedures, explain th e complete operation to  the patient in detail. Specify that he or she will have to  breathe th rough straws placed in the nostrils. Em phasize the feeling of enclosure and the slight difficulty in breathing th at m ight be encountered. Constant reassurance during the entire procedure will help the patient avoid the feeling of panic.  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  231 7.12.2. This procedure must be completed in a minimum of time and can be accomplished best by thorough preplanning. All equipm ent and m aterials m ust be laid out for immediate availability (Figure 7.9).

Cut and remove the area within the outline from the cardboard sheet (Figure 7.13).  Figure 7.13. Cutting the Facial Outline From the Cardboard.  7.12.3.5. Place the cardb oard sheet over the patient’s face. The cardboard should fit loosely. If necessary, trim  it to prevent distortion of the facial tissues. S upport the cardboard fr om underneath, using folded cloth towels. Fill the space between the cardboard and tissue by gently adapting rope caulking cord (Figure7.14).  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  233 7.12.3.6. Fold a dampened towel and drape across the patient’s forehead to keep the impression material out of the patient’s hair (Figure 7.14).  Generously coat all e xposed hair (eyebrows, eyelashes, and sideburns) with petrolatum (vaseline). 7.12.3.7. Cut one end of each of two straws approxi mately 1 inch from the flexible portion. Insert these ends gently into the nos trils. Carefully pack a well lubricated (vas eline) piece of bulk cotton into each no stril around the straws  for support (Figure 7.14). A large ball-sh aped burnisher is an excellent packing instrument. Be sure to have the patient close his or her m outh and breathe through the straws to determine breathing tolerance.   Figure 7.14. Patient Prepared for the Impression.   7.12.3.8. Prepare three batches of re gular set alginate. Measure the powder and liquid for each batch and place it in  separate containers. Use  three separate mixing bowls. Measu re cold tap water for each batch an d place in a separate bo wl. All thre e batches require app roximately 8 scoops of alginate powder.  7.12.3.9. The first m ix should be thinner than the  subsequent mixes and its water-to-powder ratio should be 2 to 1. The two succeeding mixes should have a ratio of 1 1/2 to 1. 7.12.3.10. Pour the first mix (thin) over the facial tissues while the dentist distributes it with the fingers to prevent bubble form ation (Figure 7.1 5). Prepare second and  third mixes while the first m ix is being applied. Apply this thicker alginate w ith spatu las to bu ild u p a layer  approximately 3/8 inch thick.  7.12.3.11. While the alginate is still tacky, insert bent paper clips or unfolded 4 by 4 gauze pads into it (Figure 7.16). 7.12.3.12. Trim  the set alginate away  leaving a m inimal m argin of approxim ately 1/2 inch (Figure 7.16). To increase the adhesion between  the alginate and supporting stone, spray the surface of the alginate with an inhalation of the spray (Figure 7.17). 7.12.3.13. During the next procedure, the assistant prepares a flowable mix of fast setting stone. Use slurry water concentrate to shorten the setting time of stone. Apply the stone with spatulas to cover all of the exposed im pression material to a depth of 1/2 inch (Figures 7.18 and 7.19). Several mixes of stone will be required. adhesive m aterial.

A cleft palate is a defect in the roof of the mouth and the nasal cavity. Clefts may be confined to the soft palate (Figur e 7.24-A), or they m ay include all or  part of the hard palate (7.24-B). Palatal clefts may extend anteriorly  to include clefts of the anterior  alveolar ridge (Figure 7.24-C). If a cleft is present at birth, it is  called “congenital.” If it is  a result of injury, disease,  or surgery, it is called an “acquired cleft.” 238  Figure 7.24. Cleft Palates. AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  7.14. Obturator. An obturator is a prosthetic  device that closes the unnatu ral opening and reestablishes the separation between the nose and m outh. The anatom y of cleft defects is illustrated in Figure 7.25. Ideally, the obturator should fully it replaces, although this is not always possible. The palatal part of the prosthesis should com pletely close the opening between the  mouth and the nose so food taken into the m outh does not enter the nasal cavity.

Developing adequate retention for the prosth esis can be easy or di fficult, depending on the number, shape, and distribution of rem aining natural teeth; strength and di rection of muscle pull; amount of peripheral seal that can be obtained; ex tent of tissue coverage;  presence of scar tissue; and size and weight of the pharyngeal section.  7.15.2. A principle that is always used in obturator design is to obtain all of the tissue coverage the patient can tolerate. Undercuts are u sed where possible, even if it is nec essary to extend the base into the nasal cavity. Scribing  a bead line in the cast around the  periphery of the design usually improves peripheral seal. The dentist knows which tissues are soft and wh ich are hard and will prescribe the exact borders of the prosthesis as  well as the depth and pos ition of any beading that is to be done.  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.25.

The dentist furnishes a prelim inary impression and prescribes the outline for an individual impression tray and the material from which it is to be made. 7.16.2. Final im pressions must be handled with a gr eat deal of care. They represent painstaking work by the dentist as well as discom fort and fatigue for the patient. When boxing and pouring one of these impressions, the plaster and pumice method gives you the most control with the least potential for distortion. See Volume 1, Chapter 7, for guidance on the plaster pumice method. 7.16.3. Pour an artificial stone m aster cast as s oon after the dentist m akes the i mpression as possible. Duplicate the m aster cast before surveying. The duplicat e can be used as a backup in case of accident (Figure 7.27-A). 7.16.4. Survey the m aster cast.

The dentist will m ake sure the fram ework fits the patient’s m outh, take m odeling plastic and attach it to the retention loop, soften the modeling plastic, and place the entire apparatus in the patient’s mouth. He or she will direct the patient to go through a series of movements to mold the modeling plastic into a bulb shape. Sometimes the dentist will coat the modeling plastic bulb w ith a secondary impression material (low fusing wax) to pick up fine details (Figure 7.27-F and -G). 7.16.10. Process the pharyngeal section in acrylic re sin (Figure 7.27-H). When the bulb portion is going to be solid, flask, pack, and process it in the usual manner.

Section 7D—Custom Earpiece 7.17. Introduction:  7.17.1. A custom earpiece is an acrylic device fabricated to custom fit the patient’s ear and used to deliver sound to the ear by way of a  hollow tube. The increase in comfort of a custom  earpiece versus a standard earpiece is considerable and eas ily justifiable when one considers the am ount of time personnel, such as aircrews or air traffic controllers in critical situations, spend depending on precise reception.  242  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.17.2. Traditionally, many different types and  models of standard earpieces, which  are relatively expensive and usually fit poorly, ar e used in th e work environment. One standard model consists of several rubber bulbs from which the user selects the best fit. A solution for military members is to have a custom earpiece fabricated.  7.17.3. The custom earpiece is composed of acrylic that fills the i nner “C” portion of the patient’s  ear and supports an earmold ring and spring locate d in the center of the acrylic (Figure 7.28-A). A hollow channel is located from the earmold ring to the end of the ear canal portion of the acrylic to deliver the sound. A hollow tube is then connected to the earm old ring from the radio or device that will be m onitored by the operator. Paragr aph 7.18 discusses the fabrication of a custom earpiece. 7.18. Fabricating a Custom Earpiece: 7.18.1. Making the Impression. The dentist will m ake an im pression of the patie nt’s inner “C” portion of the ear using a polyvinylsiloxanne or  comparable impression material (Figure 7.28-B). The impression is then disinfected and taken to the laboratory for the fabrication process. 7.18.2. Fabricating an Alginate Mold: 7.18.2.1. Make an alginate m old of the im pression. Cut any excess impression m aterial that  extends beyond the inner “C” portion of the ear (Figure 7.28-C). Cu t the exterior surface of the impression material flat to create the surface where you will later place the earmold ring.  7.18.2.2. Use a standard paper cup to m ake an alginate mold of the impression. First, place the impression inside the cup to ensure there is at least 6 mm   of clearance ar ound the entire impression. Mix two scoops of alginate to 100 ml  of water and vacuum m ix for approximately 15 seconds.  7.18.2.3. Apply alginate onto the impression first to reduce the possibility of trapping air. Then pour the remaining alginate into the cup and set or sink the impression until the outer portion is flush with the top of the alginate (Figure 7.28-D).  7.18.2.4. After the alginate has set, use small bur st of air to rem ove the im pression. Be careful—the alginate is soft and can be easily torn. Check inside to see if there are any voids or loose material that can be easily filled or removed.  7.18.3. Pouring the Acrylic Earpiece. Use clear orthodon tic acrylic to fill the alginate m old and form a dense acrylic resin earp iece. Mix a 2 to  1 polymer/monomer ratio to achiev e a runny mix that can be poured into the m old. The m ix should be  thin enough to fill all of  the little in tricate areas of the alginate mold. As you  pour the acrylic into  the cup, slightly tilt  the cup in different directions so you do not trap air  in some of those hard-to-reach areas. Because orthodontic acrylic shrinks about 7 percent of its bulk, you need to f7.28-E). Cure the acrylic according to the manufacturer’s directions. 7.18.4. Earmold Ring and Spring Placement:  ill slightly above the top of the mold (Figure  7.18.4.1. After the acrylic has cured,  remove the earpiece from the alginate mold (Figure 7.28-F). Flatten the outer portion of the acrylic earpie ce that was exposed from the alginate m old to create a surface that will accept the earmold ring. Place the ring on the flat surface in a position  that allows an adequate amount of resin around the border of the ring, and then trace around the ring (Figure 7.28-G).  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.28. Fabricating a Custom Earpiece.  243   7.18.4.2. Using the outline of the earmold ring as a  guide, make a hole in the acrylic so the ring will sit flush with th e top of  the acrylic and h ave approximately 1.5 to  2 mm of space around  the ring.  7.18.4.3. Next, place the earm old spring into the ear mold ring. Apply a sm all amount of clear utility wax into the opening of the earmold ring to ensure acrylic does not fill the ring. Place the ring into the recessed area and sp rinkle acrylic around the ring to  seal it in pl ace (Figure 7.28-H).  7.18.4.4. After the acrylic has cured, smooth the area around the ring with a carbide bur (Figure 7.28-I).  244  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.18.5. Finishing the Custom Earpiece. Use a #8 round bur to create  an echo chamber under the ring (Figure 7.28-J). The cham ber should be no less than 5 mm in de pth and the sam e or slightly larger than the ring. This allows for the sound to be slightly am plified to increase the hearing ability of the person we aring the custom earpiece. With a  small round bur, create a channel from the echo chamber to the end of the ear canal. Finish this sound canal by using a #6 or #8 round bur to widen the canal. Complete the custom  earpiece by rounding any sharp edges. Then pum ice and polish the appliance (Figure 7.28-K).  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  245 WEIGHTS AND MEASURES Chapter 8   8.1. Carat and Fineness of Gold Alloy: 8.1.1. Overview. Information giving the amount of pure gold in an alloy is usually supplied by the manufacturer on the alloy wrapper. It may be stated in terms of either “carat” or “fineness.”  8.1.2. Carat. Carat is the number of parts of gold in 24 part s of alloy. Think of the unit of gold as being divided into 24 smaller units. The num ber of these small units that are pure gold is the car at number. For exam ple, if the alloy is  12 carat, 1 2 of the 24 parts (or 50 pe rcent) are gold. If th e alloy is 24 carat, it is all gold. 8.1.3. Fineness. Fineness is the number of parts of gold in 1, 000 parts of alloy. For exam ple, the alloy is 750 fine, then 750 of th Therefore, 500 fineness is exactly one-half (or 50 percent) gold. 8.1.4. Conversion:  ese parts (or 75 percent) are gold;8.1.4.1.  Percent  is  the num ber of parts of gold in 100 converting the carat to fineness (or the fineness to carat) is to use the following formula: parts of alloy.

Measuring Temperature: is 12. 8.2.1. Scales (Figure 8.1). Temperatures are commonly measured on a Fahrenheit (F) scale, where 32 oF is the freezing point of water and 212  oF is the boiling point, or on a Centigrade (C) scale, where 0 oC is the freezing point of water and 100 oC is the boiling point.  Figure 8.1. Centigrade-Fahrenheit Conversion Scale.  8.2.2.  Conversion. Centigrade can be conve rted to Fahrenheit or vi ce versa by m eans of the  following formula: 9C = 5F - 160. 8.2.2.1. Centigrade to Fahrenheit Conversion. To convert Centigrade to Fahrenheit, multiply the Centigrade temperature by 9, add 160, and then divide the total by 5. For example:    Centigrade      212    = 100 o 9(100) = 5F – 160 900 + 160 = 5F 1060 = F o = Fahrenheit 5247 AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.2.2.2. Fahrenheit to Centigrade Conversion. To convert Fahrenheit to Centigrade, multiply the Fahrenheit temperature by 5, subtract 160, and divide the total by 9. For example:      = 212 o 9C = 5(212) – 160 9C = 1060 – 160 C =  9009  Fahrenheit      Centigrade 8.3. Systems of Measuring Weight. The following four system s of we ight measurements are used in  the dental laborato ry: avoirdupoi s (commercial), apothecaries (m edicine and drugs), troy (precious metals and alloys), and metric (some pharmaceuticals, such as alcohol). The grain is the basic unit in the avoirdupois, apothecaries,  and troy system s, but  not  in the m etric system . See Figure 8.2  for a comparison of the various systems.  Figure 8.2.

Measure of Liquid or Volume: 8.5.1. The basic unit of the m etric system of liquid measurement is the cubic cen timeter (cm3) or milliliter (ml) (Figure 8.4). One cm3 of water at 39.5 oF weighs 1 gram. 8.5.2. Either the apothecaries wine measure or the metric system is used to measure the volume of liquids. Figure 8.5 compares apothecaries and metric equivalents. 8.6. Standards. Gauge is a m easure of thickness that can be applied to m etal wire, sheet metal, wire wax, and sheet wax. The Brown and Sharpe wire ga uge or the Am erican wire gaug e—the two are th e same—represent a  stand ard for w ire and she ets th at do not contain iron.  The Brown and Sharpe (or American W ire) conversion m easurements appear in Table 8.2.  NOTE:  The us e of  this  p articular standard is common, but not necessarily universal. 8.7. Melting Points of Pure Metals. The melting point of aluminum is 1218 oF, gold is 1945  oF, lead is 621 oF, and silver is 1761 oF.  AFPAM47-103V2     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.4.
