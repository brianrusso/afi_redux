This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) identifies Public Affairs (PA) education and training, training support resources and initial qualification requirements.  2.  The CFETP consists of two parts, which are used to plan, manage, and control training within the career field.  2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A provides general information; Section B identifies career field progression and career path information; Section C associates the Entry, Qualified, and Staff Levels with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and experience); and Section D addresses resource constraints.  2.2.  Part II provides options available to meet education and training needs.  Section A identifies basic skills requirements used to develop the Course Training Standard (CTS) for initial PA skills training at the Defense Information School (DINFOS) and technical references to support training.  Section B identifies DINFOS courses used for Air Force PA officer/civilian development.  Section C provides information on professional societies. Section D, Support Materials, and Section E, MAJCOM-Unique Requirements, are not used.  Section F offers references and suggested readings.  3.  Submit comments or proposed changes to this document to safpar.workflow@pentagon.af.mil              5   PART I  Abbreviations/Terms Explained Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM).  Representative appointed by the respective HQ USAF Deputy Chief of Staff or Under Secretary to ensure assigned AF specialties are trained and utilized to support AF mission requirements. Air Force Specialty (AFS).  A basic grouping of positions requiring similar skills and qualifications.  Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP).  A comprehensive core training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for a specialty. Career Training Guide (CTG).  Identifies performance and knowledge requirements for a specialty.  It supports the specialty’s duty description outlined in the Officer Classification Directory (available on the Air Force Personnel Services website).   Core Task.  A task the AFCFM has identified as a minimum qualification requirement for all personnel within an Air Force specialty, regardless of duty position.  Every person in upgrade training for this specialty will be trained and certified on all core tasks, regardless of their duty position.  Only a percentage of tasks for each specialty are listed as mandatory.  This gives units needed flexibility to manage their workforce training. Course Training Standard (CTS).  The first component of the CTG, it lists the learning objectives for initial skills training. The CTS serves as the career field’s contract with the schoolhouse. Defense Information School (DINFOS).  Public affairs schoolhouse and component of the Defense Media Activity (DMA). Education & Training Course Announcements.  ETCA is an Internet information resource located at https://etca.randolph.af.mil/ or accessed via the Air Force Portal.  ETCA contains procedures, course information, funding information, reporting instructions, and listings for formal and Air Force ancillary courses conducted or managed by the MAJCOMs or other agencies. Field Training.  Technical, operator, and other training that either a field training detachment or mobile training team conducts at operational locations on specific systems and associated direct-support equipment. MAJCOM Functional Manager (MFM).  Representative appointed by the MAJCOM who directs the development and coordination of courses and standards for training and educating personnel in a specific career field at the MAJCOM level. On-the-Job Training. A delivery method used to certify personnel in both upgrade (skill level award) and job qualification (duty position certification) training. It is hands-on, over-the-shoulder training conducted at the duty location. Resource Constraints.  Resource deficiencies (such as money, facilities, time, manpower, and equipment) that preclude desired training from being delivered. Training Business Area (TBA).  Automated training records and management application which replaced the need to file and maintain paper copies of the AF Form 623, On-The-Job Training Record. Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW).  A forum of the AFCFM, MFMs, subject matter experts (SMEs), and AETC training personnel that evaluates career field training requirements.   6   Section A - General Information  1.  Purpose.  This CFETP establishes PA training requirements. It outlines the training that people in this Air Force specialty should receive to support their professional development and defines the competencies necessary to progress throughout their careers.   2.  Responsibilities. The Air Force career field manager, MAJCOM functional managers, training managers, supervisors, and trainers use this document to guide initial qualification training. 2.1.  The AFCFM creates the CFETP to establish and standardize initial qualification training and arranges for training tasks listed in Part II, Section A, to be loaded in the Training Business Area (TBA) system.  TBA is accessible through the Air Force Portal.   2.2.  MFMs monitor training progress and establish MAJCOM-unique training, if required. The Air Force Public Affairs Agency will monitor training for individuals not belonging to a MAJCOM. 2.3.  Training managers, supervisors, and trainers oversee task completion. As officers complete tasks and on-the-job training, training managers will update the TBA system appropriately; once an officer is awarded the 35P3 AFSC, no further TBA updates are required.  For civilians, task completion can be annotated on hard-copy training records.   2.4. Trainees complete the requirements specified in this plan. 3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority and will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy.  MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on career field training requirements.  Section B - Air Force Specialty Progression and Information  1.  Specialty Summary.  PA provides advice, trusted counsel, and support to commanders, other senior leaders, and unit personnel.  It fulfills commanders’ priorities by researching, planning, resourcing, executing, and evaluating PA operations, including visual information activities, to communicate timely, truthful, accurate, and credible information to Air Force, domestic, and international audiences.  PA builds, maintains, and strengthens public trust and support and Airman morale and readiness, and contributes to global influence and deterrence through engagement on the information front.   2.  Skill and Career Progression 2.1.  Adequate training and timely progression from the entry to the qualified level have an important role in the Air Force’s ability to accomplish its mission.  It is essential everyone involved in training does their part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program. Guidance provided in this part of the CFETP ensures all individuals receive the correct training at appropriate points in their careers. 2.2.  Knowledge is mandatory of:  missions, roles, functions, organizational structures, relationships, and operational planning objectives of the Air Force; oral, written, and visual communication concepts and principles; traditional and emerging methods and techniques for  7   disseminating information; basic communication theory; legal and ethical considerations surrounding the practice of communication; communication research, planning, and analysis; and joint expeditionary operating environments.  2.3.  Education.  For entry into this specialty, undergraduate academic specialization is desirable in communication, journalism, public relations, visual information, broadcasting, advertising, marketing, or one of the behavioral sciences (sociology or social psychology).  2.4.  Training.  Completion of the DINFOS Public Affairs Qualification Course and the core tasks in the CFETP is mandatory for the award of AFSC 35P3 to both active-duty and Reserve Component officers.  2.5.  Experience.  For award of AFSC 35P3 to both active-duty and Reserve Component officers, a minimum of 18 months of experience in PA assignments is mandatory.  2.6.  Staff Level (35P4).  Education and training requirements for this level are the same as for the Qualified Level (35P3), and individuals must also have a minimum of 18 months of experience in PA assignments.  The only difference is that the 35P4 AFSC is used to designate manpower positions in organizations above Wing level, regardless of grade.  2.7.  Other.  For retention of the core AFSC 35P, the officer must not have served outside of the career field for more than 60 consecutive months without AFCFM approval. 3.  Career Development 3.1.  Future Air Force leaders will be those who fully understand the operational Air Force, can demonstrate breadth and depth in their specialty, and have proven their ability to lead and think of themselves as Airmen first, specialists second.  Successful senior leaders build their careers one assignment at a time, always keeping in mind that their current assignment is their most important for career progression.   3.2.  Professional Development.  Deliberate professional development is essential to produce AF  leaders with relevant technical expertise, diverse experience, an ability to apply the tenets of air, space, and cyberspace, and a sterling record of performance.  Professional development requires: 3.2.1.  Diversity of assignments (i.e., wing, combat camera, NAF, MAJCOM, Air Staff, FOA/DRU, joint) and career-broadening opportunities (i.e., commander, regional affairs/political-military affairs strategist, training flight commander, and education with industry).  3.2.2.  Completing professional military education, a relevant advanced academic degree, and supplemental training and education. 3.2.3.  Deploying to combat/contingency operations and participating in military exercises.  Deployments and exercises are essential components of professional development; many of these opportunities are available to civilian volunteers. 3.2.4.  Mentorship by commanders, supervisors, and senior AF leaders inside and outside of the career field.  Officers/civilians should review career goals with their commander or senior PAs at  8   least annually and discuss career progression using the 35P/civilian equivalent career planning diagrams shown in Figures 1 and 2. 4.  Career Field Path.  The career planning diagrams (Figures 1 and 2) graphically display the types of opportunities available at different times in an individual’s career.  The diagrams are only guides; they do not represent every career path or opportunity, and there is no specific career path that guarantees success.  Early on, individuals should develop a solid technical and operational experience base and continually focus on gaining depth and breadth as their careers progress. The diagrams should be used as planning guides by senior PA leaders, commanders, supervisors, and individuals in conjunction with other planning tools, to include AFI 36-2110, Assignments, and PA Development Team vectors.  While an individual’s career path may be influenced by personal aspirations, it is ultimately driven by needs of the Air Force. Figure 1.  35P Officer Career Planning Diagram     9   Figure 2. PA Civilian Career Planning Diagram      Section C – Proficiency Training Requirements  1.1.  Entry Level (35P1) KNOWLEDGE EDUCATION Knowledge is mandatory of:  missions, roles, functions, organizational structures, relationships, and operational planning objectives of the Air Force; oral, written, and visual communication concepts and principles; traditional and emerging methods and techniques of disseminating information; basic communication theory; legal and ethical considerations surrounding the practice of communication; communication research, planning, and analysis; and joint expeditionary operating environments. For entry into this specialty, undergraduate academic specialization in communication, journalism, public relations, visual information, broadcasting, advertising, marketing, or one of the behavioral sciences (sociology or social psychology) is desirable.  10   TRAINING No mandatory AETC training courses are required for assignment to this skill level. EXPERIENCE No previous experience is required.  1.2.  Qualified Level (35P3)  KNOWLEDGE EDUCATION TRAINING EXPERIENCE OTHER Knowledge is mandatory of:  organization, mission, and operations of the Air Force; oral, written, and visual communication concepts and principles; traditional and emerging methods and techniques of disseminating information; basic communication theory; legal and ethical considerations; communication research, planning, and analysis; and joint expeditionary operating environments. No additional education is required. Completion of PAQC and the CFETP core tasks is mandatory for both active-duty and Reserve Component officers.  For retention of core AFSC 35P, the officer must not serve outside the career field for more than 60 consecutive months without AFCFM approval. For award of AFSC 35P3 to both active-duty and Reserve Component officers, a minimum of 18 months of experience in PA assignments is mandatory.   AFSC 35P4 is used to designate manpower positions in organizations above Wing level, regardless of grade.  Officers must meet the same training and experience requirements as those for award of AFSC 35P3.  Section D - Resource Constraints  1.   Purpose.  This section identifies known resource constraints that preclude optimal/desired training from being developed or conducted.  Included are narrative explanations of each constraint and its effect on training.  Finally, this section includes actions required, OPR, and target completion date.  Resource constraints will be reviewed and updated annually.  2.  Constraints.  Some tasks in the CFETP cannot be performed at every unit.  In such cases, individuals must describe procedures needed to complete the tasks and explain their underlying concepts and principles.    11   PART II Section A -  Public Affairs Course Training Standard  1.  Implementation.   The CTS establishes the training requirement using tasks, knowledge, and proficiency levels of training for Air Force Course EBOBD35P1 00AA, Public Affairs Qualification Course   2.  Purpose.  The CTS lists task performance, task knowledge, and subject knowledge levels needed for 35P qualification training. The Career Training Guide (CTG) identifies performance and knowledge requirements for PA officers and civilians.  It supports the 35P duty description outlined in the Officer Classification Directory (available on the Air Force Personnel Services website).    The CTS is the first component of the CTG and lists the learning objectives for initial skills training.  Individuals will know the information in each reference to the level indicated by the associated Proficiency Code Key.   A bibliography is provided at the end of the CTG to assist users in locating these reference materials.    3.  Documentation  3.1.  Column 1 indentifies the tasks that must be successfully performed or the knowledge that must be displayed.  3.2.  Column 2 identifies mandatory tasks/knowledge to acquire the 35P3 AFSC.  Officers are upgraded to 35P3 upon completion of core tasks, graduation from PAQC, and after serving 18 months in a PA position.  3.3.  Column 3 indicates the proficiency level the trainee has upon completion of PAQC.  3.4.  Column 4 indicates the proficiency level the trainee must attain to be fully qualified.  If the PAQC level is sufficient, no further training is required.  3.5.  Column 5 indicates the method for obtaining a higher proficiency than what PAQC provides.  3.6.  Individuals accomplish training not acquired during PAQC by on-the-job training (OJT). Other avenues for obtaining proficiency in these tasks are listed in Section B, Course Directory.  4.  Supervisors will review the CFETP with trainees at an initial interview within 30 days of the trainee’s assignment to the unit.  During the interview, discuss core requirements listed in the task and knowledge list (identified by an “X” in the Core Task column), and explain that core tasks must be completed within 18 months for upgrade to 35P3.  Supervisors will continue to review training progress to coincide with the normal feedback cycle, at a minimum.      12   5.  TBA will be used to track officers task completion.  As officers complete their OJT, supervisors or trainers will update the TBA system appropriately; once an officer is awarded the 35P3 AFSC, no further TBA updates are required.  For civilians, task completion can be annotated on hard-copy training records.       ecnamrofreP egdelwonK sleveL sleveL ksaT ksaT tcejbuS sleveL egdelwonK    SCALE VALUE PROFICIENCY CODE KEY DEFINITION:  The trainee: 1 2 3 4 a b c d A B C D X Can do simple parts of the task; needs to be told or shown how to do most of the task.
