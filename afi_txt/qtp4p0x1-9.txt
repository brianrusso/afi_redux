This Qualification Training Package (QTP) was developed to enhance and standardize on-the-job training for 4P0X1 personnel.  As a trainer, the QTPs provide teachable elements of  task  breakdowns.    The  teachable  elements  will  assist  in  guiding  the  trainee  towards independent  task  performance,  proficiency,  and  serve  as  an  evaluation  tool  for trainers/certifiers.  2.  Review the volume(s) of the Career Development Course(s) (CDC) and identify which module(s) of the QTP is needed for the trainee’s job position or upgrade skill-level training.  The QTP training for each module should be accomplished in the order which most closely mirrors the area in which the trainee is working.  Items in column 2 of the Pharmacy Job Qualification Standard (JQS)/Specialty Training Standard (STS) marked with a 5 or 7 are core tasks for the 4P career field.  Additional proficiency training may be required for these tasks at the supervisor’s discretion.   3.  Ensure the trainee reviews the training references in each module prior to attempting any task or QTP evaluation.  Review the performance checklist and training objective with the trainee.  If the trainee has questions about the objective, clarify the desired outcome/results of performance, demonstration or completion of the task.  Remember the objective of each QTP is to standardize training and allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform the task independently.    4.  When the trainee has received sufficient training and is ready to be  evaluated on the objective, follow the evaluation instructions.  The performance checklist must be used as you  evaluate  each  task  objective.    When  the  trainee  successfully  demonstrates  and accomplishes the objective, document the task completion appropriately  in the member’s Air Force Training Record (AFTR).  5.  The QTP task completion is to be annotated in the trainee’s electronic training record.  NOTE:  The individual checklists and final evaluations are not filed in each member’s user files.   3 | P a g e  6.    If  the  trainee  does  not  accomplish  the  objective,  review  the  areas  needing  further instruction.    Conduct  feedback  for  each  module  with  the  trainee,  and  document appropriately  in  the  member’s  Air  Force  Training  Record.    As  the  trainer,  once  you  are satisfied  the  trainee  is  ready  to  perform  the  task,  he/she  will  be  re-evaluated  until  the objective is met.  7.    If  a  task  being  trained  requires  third  party  certification  by  a  task  certifier/certifying official,  the  trainer  ensures  trainee  is  qualified  to  perform  the  task  independently.    The trainee will then be evaluated by certifier/certifying official.  Tasks requiring certification are identified in column 2 of JQS with a number sign (#).  The certifier/certifying official will ensure documentation in column 3E of the JQS. The certifier will ensure that a trainer’s signature is documented prior to signing off on the task in AFTR.  8.  Tasks associated with a QTP are identified in column 4D of the STS.  The QTPs are a necessary  tool  for  standardizing  task  qualifications  for  upgrade  training  or  job  position training.    Such  standardization  benefits  the  JQS  training  concept  throughout  a  member’s career.    These  documents  may  also  be  used  in  assessing/certifying  pharmacy  technicians upon arrival at a new duty station.  9.    Feedback  is  a  vital  and  important  part  of  improving  our  educational  process  for pharmacy technicians.  Your first hand expertise is valued and feedback highly encouraged ensuring we have the most up-to-date information and training possible.   Please direct all inquiries to:  your immediate supervisor.                              4 | P a g e  SUBJECT AREA:  Non-Controlled Medication Audit Process TASK NAME(S):  Procedures include the following: • Identifying which five medications are to be audited and for how long of a time period. •  How to conduct the initial inventory of the five medications. •  How to conduct the ending inventory of the five medications. •  Determining  the  amount  of  the  five  medications  that  were  ordered  during  the •  Determining the amount of the five medications that were dispensed during the audit period. audit period. •  Calculating  the  differences  in  the  expected  inventory  numbers  to  the  actual inventory numbers. •  Reporting instructions and tracking options/examples.

It is therefore necessary to run the top 100 line item report in DMLSS and select which five medications to inventory. Audit Overview:  Ensure that the five medications are able to be audited accurately;  in  that  there  aren’t  partial  dispensing’s  of  the  medications.  Verify  that  the  medications  that  are  chosen  are  on  the  top  100  report every  month  that  they  are  audited.    Ensure  the  audit  times  are consistently recorded to indicate opening or ending of the shift in order to run  the  correct  usage  report  from  CHCS.  A  plan  of  action  may  be necessary  if  diversion  is  suspected  in  the  supply  chain  to  include movement from the Prime Vendor all the way to the patient.   1. Identify which five medications are to be inventoried and for what time period. a. Log into DMLSS b. Click on the Reports Icon c. Select the High Total Expenditure Report d. Run the report for the current fiscal year, unless you are at the beginning of the fiscal year. e. Choose to report by MTF  f. Minimum dollar value can be set at $0.00.   g. Hit the submit button and allow for lengthy runtime. h. Export the report to Excel.  Select the entire worksheet by hitting the button  with a triangle in it between the A and the 1 cells.  Then hit the Sort & Filter button in the upper right hand corner and choose Filter. j. Go to the pack price amount column and choose from highest to lowest.  You will then need to filter out the non-med items from the short item description column. k. Limit the report to the top 100 items for review.  j. Print report for Pharmacy Flight Commander or designee to select the five  medications to be audited and have them also select a time period for the audit based upon local guidance. (One month, one quarter, etc.)  See Attachment 1 for an example report. 2. Conduct the initial inventory of the five medications at all of the pharmacy sites within the MTF.         SAT  UNSAT              7 | P a g e  a.  Identify all of the locations within the MTF that the medications are stored. Remember to include automated dispensers and inpatient U/D meds.  b. Physically count all of the medications to be audited at either the beginning  or end of the duty day as indicated by the audit time period.  If the audit is to be completed from 1 April until 30 April the inventory could be accomplished at either the opening of 1 April or the close of the last duty day in March.   c. Summarize and total by medication and record on a tracking page to include the time of the audit.  See Attachment 2 for an example. 3. Conduct the ending inventory of the five medications at all of the pharmacy sites within the MTF. a. See procedures from performance item 2. a thru c.  4. Determine the amount of the five medications that were ordered during  the audit period. a.  Obtain  a  consumption  history  report  from  Medical  Logistics.    The  report  should contain the order history for the five medications during the audit period. See Attachment 3 for an example.    b. Summarize usage by medication and enter the total amount ordered onto  the tracking sheet.  5.  Determine  the  amount  of  the  five  medications  that  were  dispensed  during the audit period.  Note:  While  there  are  multiple  ways  in  which  to  summarize  the  data using  both  Excel  and  CHCS  the  authors  have  tried  to  add  some standardization  to  the  process.    Please  seek  out  a  person  with  Excel experience and learn more efficient ways to perform tasks with Excel.  a. Log into CHCS  b. Enter ^ODU  c. Select 1) Patient, Drug and Physician  d. Select 1) Detailed Data Report  c. Choose report to run ALL SITES, PHYSICIANS, and PATIENTS  d. Select the medications to be audited one at a time.  e. Choose earliest and latest fill dates based upon audit period.  f. Enter Q at the Queue on Device prompt.  g. Enter spool at the next Queue on Device prompt.  h. Enter  a name of  your file at the Spool Document Name prompt.   If  you  name it your last name and then the report name it will be easy to retrieve.  For example if Tim Smith was ordering the report for the 5 Meds, name it Smith5med.   i. Confirm you are adding a new spool document and enter thru the expiration  date warning and start time is now. j. Wait until report is run, typically five minutes or less. k. Enter ^PSR and select Print Spooled Report                          8 | P a g e  l. Enter your document name, Smith5med  m. At the output to: prompt, go to the  File selection in the upper left hand  corner of the screen and select Logging.  Activate Logging on and Disk hot buttons.    Hit  the  browse  button  and  choose  the  location  and  name  that  you want to save the report under. Then hit OK. n. You will return to the Output to selection, hit enter and watch the report  cycle thru the screen.  o.  Go  to  the  File  selection  again  and  select  Logging  and  Disk  hot  buttons  again to turn them off.  p. You are done with the CHCS portion of the task.  Open Excel.  q. Select File and then Open, find your file in the open file window, but be  sure to change the file selector from All Excel Files to All Files.  Double click on your file.  r.  The  text  import  wizard  will  open.    Choose  the  Delimited  hot  button  and  then hit next.  Ensure the Fixed Width delimiters button is selected and then scroll down into your report several inches until you see data.  Find the Qty and the Drug column headings and click just to the left of the Qty and Drug headings.  You will then click to the right of the Qty and 1.5 inches to the right of the Drug name.  Once you have “drawn” four lines on the report hit finish.  Your document will then be converted to Excel formatting. s. Select Column A, C, and E then delete them.  t. You will be left with 2 columns.  Find the first quantity in column A and  delete the cell just above it.  Allow the program to “shift cells up”.  This will align the quantities with the medication names. u. Return to the top of the excel worksheet and select the triangle cell between  A and 1. The entire worksheet will be highlighted.  Select the Sort & Filter button, usually in the upper right hand area of the tool bar.   v.  Select  the  filter  button  for  column  B,  it  looks  like  a  hot  button  with  a  triangle  in  it.    Choose  the  select  all  button  all  of  the  selections  should  be unselected at this point.  Now reselect only the names of the 5 medications that want to report on.  w. You can now summarize the totals of each medication that were dispensed  by selecting the first dispensed quantity in Column A with the left click of the mouse.  Hold the left button down and scroll the mouse down until you reach the end of the dispensing’s for that medication. x. Look at the bottom right of the Excel worksheet and the Sum: field will  show you how many of that medication was dispensed.  y. Record that number in the dispensed column of your tracking worksheet.  6. Calculate the differences in the expected inventory numbers compared  to the actual inventory numbers.   a. All of the columns in your tracking sheet should now be completed.   b. Add your starting count to your ordered count. c. Subtract your dispensed count from the number in b. and enter that number  in your Expected End column.                    9 | P a g e  d. Compare the Ending count column and Expected End column and record  the difference as either a positive number (over) or a negative number (under) in the delta column.   e. Save report for historical relook and then carry the Delta over from the next  month for comparison if you are auditing the same medications for more than a month.  7.  Report  results  to  the  Pharmacy  Flight  Commander  and/or  the  Pharmacy & Therapeutics Function per local policy and instruction. a. Complete the tracking spreadsheet and copy the worksheet to begin again  the next audit period. b. Determine if diversion is suspected and if so develop an action plan for the  pharmacy and logistics departments. c. Create a Memo for Record to the P&T Function; see Attachment 4 for an  example.
