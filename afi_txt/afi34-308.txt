Background:  A  full-time,  40-hour  week  employee  works  Monday  through  Friday,  off Saturday  and  Sunday.    For  the  52  week  period  prior  to  4  January,  the  date  of  injury,  the employee  earned  wages  of  $27,144.    Employee’s  hourly  rate  of  pay  at  the  time  of  injury  was $12.50.  The first  day of lost time was 5 January with  a return to  work on 11 January.  On 16 February, the employee became disabled  again; returned to  work on 23 March.  The employee was paid sick leave for 5-7 January. A3.2.  AWW:  The  higher  rate  is  always  used.      Multiplying  the  hourly  rate  x  40  would  only yield  $500.    Dividing  the  gross  wages  received  over  the  previous  52  weeks,  however,  yields $522 for the AWW. A3.3.  TTD Rate:  Reference A3.1 above, minimum/maximum rates change 1October. Table A3.1.  TTD Rate If Employee AWW is: Equal/Less than $344.25 Equal/Greater than $344.26 but equal/less than $516.34 Equal/Greater than $516.35 but equal/less than $2065.30 Equal/Greater than $2065.31 Here, the employee’s earnings fall in the third class, two-thirds of the AWW yields a weekly TTD rate of $348. Benefit Equals: Employee AWW $344.26 2/3 AWW $1377.02 A3.4.  First  payment:  The  employee  is  due  benefits  from  8-10  January.    On  or  about  14 January, a payment was cut in the amount of $149.13 paying TTD for 8, 9, and 10 January, (3/7 x $348, weekly compensation rate). A3.5.  Second Payment:  On 1 March, the employee is due a payment for TTD benefits for the period 16 February through 1 March, totaling $696. A3.6.  Sick Pay Adjustment:  With sick leave paid earlier, the Workers’ Compensation Section will  convert  the  hours  to  a  dollar  amount  and  submit  an  accounting  transaction  to  the  Shared Service  Center  to  credit  the  injured  worker’s  sick  leave  and  reimburse  the  installation  for  the amount paid to the injured employee. A3.7.  Future  payments:  The next payment is due on 15 March for a 2-week period $696.00.  The last payment is due on 30 March and pays the balance of the TTD period, 16 thru 22 March, 7 days, $348.    16  AFI34-308  26 FEBRUARY 2015 Attachment 4 PHYSICAL ABILITY RATINGS A4.1.  Rating  Physical  Work  Demands.  The  Dictionary  of  Occupational  Titles  (DOT), Volume  II,  published  by  the  US  DOL  (4th  edition,  1991),  rates  five  categories  of  the  physical demands of work in terms of strength required: A4.2.  Sedentary  Work.    Lifting  10  pounds  maximum  and  occasionally  lifting  or  carrying,  or both, such articles as dockets, ledgers, and small tools.  Although a sedentary job is defined as one  which  involves  sitting,  a  certain  amount  of  walking  and  standing  is  often  necessary  in carrying  out  job  duties.    Jobs  are  sedentary  if  walking  and  standing  are  required  only occasionally and other sedentary criteria are met. A4.3.  Light  Work.    Lifting  20  pounds  maximum  with  frequent  lifting  up  to  10  pounds.    Even though  the  weight  lifted  may  be  only  a  negligible  amount,  a  job  is  in  this  category  when  it requires walking or standing to a significant degree, or when it involves sitting most of the time with a degree of pushing and pulling of arm and/or leg controls. A4.4.  Medium  Work.    Lifting  50  pounds  maximum  with  frequent  lifting,  and/or  carrying  of objects weighing up to 25 pounds. A4.5.  Heavy  Work.    Lifting  100  pounds  maximum  with  frequent  lifting,  carrying,  or  both objects weighing up to 50 pounds. A4.6.  Very Heavy Work.  Lifting objects in excess of 100 pounds with frequent lifting, carrying, or both objects weighing 50 pounds or more.
