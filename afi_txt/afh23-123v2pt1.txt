Purpose,  Scope & Description  of this Handbook. 1.1.1.  Purpose.  AFH  23-123,  Volume  2,  Integrated  Logistics  System  –  Supply  (ILS-S), prescribes  standardized  processes for all  materiel  management  activities  operated or supported by the  Integrated  Logistics  System  – Supply  (ILS-S). It applies  to all  ILS-S users. 1.1.2.  Description  of Parts.  This  volume  is  divided  into  the  following  parts: 1.1.2.1.  AFH 23-123, Volume  2, Part 1, ILS-S, Materiel Management Operations provides system  interface  guidance  related  to  the  execution  of  materiel  management  processes outlined  in  AFMAN 23-122. 1.1.2.2.  AFH 23-123, Volume  2, Part  2, ILS-S, Standard Base Supply System Operations specifies  the  functional  and  technical  processes  applicable  to  status  inquiries,  notices, record  maintenance  and  associated  information  within  the  Standard  Base  Supply  System (SBSS). 1.1.2.3.  AFH  23-123, Volume  2, Part  3, ILS-S,  Standard Base  Supply  System Reference specifies  the  functional  and technical  processes  applicable  to system  operations  within  the SBSS. 1.1.2.4.  AFH  23-123, Volume  2, Part  4, ILS-S,  Ancillary  Components addresses  the  Air Force  Supply  Central  Database  (AFSCDB)  and  the  Enterprise  Solution-Supply  (ES-S).  The  AFSCDB  is  designed  to  replicate  the  SBSS processes  without  changing  its  business practices.  This  part  of  the  handbook  provides  detailed  information  on  the  AFSCDB.  Additionally,  an introduction  to the ES-S and link  to the online  ES-S handbook is provided. 1.1.3.  Relation to other Publications.   If the information  in  this  handbook appears to conflict with  between  the  various  volumes,  parts,  or  chapters  of  this  handbook,  the  conflicts  will  be referred  to the  publication  OPR for resolution. 1.1.4.  Changes  to  this  publication.   Command  staff  offices  or  AF  bases  desiring  to  make recommended  changes  to the  information  contained  herein  will  make  such  recommendat io ns through to  this  publication  are allowed  at  MAJCOM level  or higher  and  must  be routed  to the  OPR of  this  publication  for coordination  prior  to certification  and approval. their  respective  MAJCOM/command  chain.  Supplements 1.1.5.  Construct.   This  manual  has  the  same  construct  as  AFI 23-101 and  AFMAN  23-122. While  not  all  sections  within  AFI 23-101 have  associated  procedures  enumerated  in  AFMAN 23-122 or  this  publication,  those  sections  where  procedures/processes  are  detailed  have  the same  section  titles.   For example,  Sec. 5D, Equipment  Management  is  the same section  in  AFI 23-101, AFMAN 23-122, and Ch 5. 1.1.5.1.  Users  are encouraged  to refer  to  Attachment  1 and  Attachment  2 for  reference information  as  well  as  identification  of  legacy  AF  supply  chain  functions  with  updated terminology. 26 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 1.1.5.2.  The  Integrated  Logistics  System-Supply  (ILS-S)  system  is  the  overarching  term used  to describe  the  system(s)  used  by  base retail  materiel  management  operations.  The ILS-S  is  comprised  of  the  Standard  Base  Supply  System  (SBSS),  Enterprise  Solution  – Supply  (ES-S), and the Air Force Supply  Centralized  Database (AFSCDB).  In many  cases the  term  ILS-S is  used  to identify  system  related  functions/references.   Where  applicable, in  some  instances,  specific  identification  of  SBSS  or  ES-S  is  used  for  more  detailed identification. Section 1B—Overview 1.2.  Overview.   This  chapter  outlines  reference  information  for  materiel  management  processes associated  with  satellite  operations.    These  processes  include  Satellite  Relocation  (Rehome); Satellite  Account  Pre-Conversion/Conversion;  and  Resizing  the  Database.    Additional  materiel management  guidance  on these processes  can be found  in  AFI 23-101 and in  AFMAN 23-122. Section 1C—Satellite Operations 1.3.  Satellite Operations. 1.3.1.

Purpose:    To  provide  a  recommended  schedule  for  planning  satellite  Rehome beginning  90 days before  the  completion  date. 1.3.1.2.  The  following  actions  will  be performed: 1.3.1.2.1.  90 Days  before  Download.  AFMC  will  contact  the  gaining  and  losing CSB  personnel,  Accounting  and  Finance  officers  of  both  the  gaining  and  losing bases and  provide  a standard  checklist  detailing  all  actions  required  in  the  90-day window. 1.3.1.2.1.1.  Items  for special  attention  are listed  below: 1.3.1.2.1.1.1.  Rehoming  requirements.  Programs  NGV028, Satellite Rehoming Download and NGV030, Satellite Rehoming Upload. 1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.  Program  NGV028.  Satellite  Rehoming  Download  provides the  capability to  transfer  selective  satellite  records  to  tape  for  rehoming actions.  The  records  selected  for  processing  based  on  the  system  designator (s) requested  are:  item,  detail,  authorized/in-use  detail,  repair  cycle,  inventor y accuracy,  and  routing  identifier  records.  The  option  exists  to  convert  data elements in  the  item,  detail,  repair  cycle,  and  authorized/in-use  records according  to the option  in  the  parameter  image. 1.3.1.2.1.1.1.2.  Program  NGV030.  Satellite  Rehoming  Upload  provides  the  capability  to load  selective  records  to the  SBSS database from  the  rehoming tape  generated  by  program  NGV028.  When  the  same  stock  number,  but different  system  designator,  is  previously  loaded, the  common  data elements on the  item  record are transferred  to the  record  being  loaded.  A printout  will be produced  indicating  the  number  of  records  loaded  and  any  reject  notices that  may  be generated. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 27 1.3.1.2.1.1.2.  Parameters  and options  for  program  NGV028. 1.3.1.2.1.1.3.  System  designator  selection.  If  the  transferring  satellite  system designator  duplicates  a designator  already  in  use at the  gaining  base, a new one must  be selected  for  the  transfer.   This  newly  selected  system  designator  will be used for  NGV028 processing. 1.3.1.2.1.2.  Support  agreements.  Initiate  AFPD  25-2,  Support  Agreements  or  a formal  memorandum  of  agreement  for  non  Support  Equipment  (SE)  Functiona l Activity  supported  accounts. 1.3.1.2.1.3.

Losing command  notifies  HQ  AFMC/FMRS  and  Defense  Finance  &  Accounting Service  (DFAS)  of  anticipated  move,  including  information  on  the  losing  and gaining  CSB, MAJCOM involved,  and date of move. 1.3.1.2.2.  30 Days  Before  Download.  The  following  actions  will  be performed: 1.3.1.2.2.1.  The  losing  CSB will  give  the  gaining  CSB a list  of all  satellite  P item records, sequenced  by the  last  ten positions  of  the stock number.  The  gaining  CSB will  use  the  list  to identify  any  duplicate  numbers  that  may  exist  between  the  two accounts.  The  gaining  base then  gives  the  satellite  (or losing  CSB, as applicable)  a block  of  serial  numbers  that  the  gaining  base has  not  used  along  with  a list  of  the duplicate  numbers.  The  satellite (or  losing  CSB)  assigns  new  numbers  by processing  indicative  data  changes  to  eliminate  the  duplication.  The  losing  CSB will  prepare  a  checklist  of  products  to  send  to  the  gaining  CSB  (reference  the applicable  areas  within  this  section).  A copy  of  the  checklist  will  be  given  to  the person  responsible  for  delivering  the  products  to  the  gaining  CSB.  He/she  must ensure  all  items  on the  list  are delivered. 1.3.1.2.2.2.  For  SE  Functional  Activity  managed  accounts,  losing  CSB  will provide  list  of  “P”  item  records  to AFMC for  stated action.  Required  products are created and transferred  from  the  losing  CSB to the gaining  AFMC. 1.3.1.2.2.3.  AF  Form  86,  Request  for  Cataloging  Data/Action  and  DD  1348-6, DoD  Single  Line  Item  Requisition  System  Document  (Manual-Long)  Form.

AFMC will  send  a list  of  Standard  Reporting  Designators  (SRD) used  by  the  satellite to  the  gaining  computer  operations  (losing  computer operations  pulls  data  via  standard  SURGE  program  that  formats  1SR  inputs). The  gaining  computer  operations  will  load  all  the SRDs that  are applicable. 1.3.1.2.5.2.  Transfer  of  exception  phrase  records/exception  codes  is  not covered  in  current  programs.  To  make  the  transfer, the  losing  computer operation  will  send the gaining  computer  operation  a current,  Exception  Phrase Listing  and a NGV027, Fail  Safe printout.  (The  losing  computer  operation  will process  standard  SURGE  programs  that  format  FXR  inputs  and  forward  the images  to the gaining  base). 1.3.1.2.5.3.  The gaining  computer  operations  will  identify  only  those exception codes which  duplicate  codes being  used  at the  gaining  base and  have  differe nt phrases.  The  gaining  base will  then  send a list  of those  duplicated  codes to the losing  base. The  losing  base  will  prepare  exception  phrase  load  inputs  to load phrases  used  by  the  transferring  satellite  and  assign  new  codes.  The  gaining computer  operation  will  process the new codes on receipt  of the shell  FCD from the  losing  base. 1.3.1.2.5.4.  The  losing  base  will  send  a list  of  Federal  Stock  Classes  (FSC)/ Material  Management  Aggregation  Codes  (MMAC)  used  by  the  satellite (SURGE)  and a list  of warehouse  numbers  assigned  for use by the satellite.  The gaining  computer  operations  will  use  these  lists  to  be  sure  that  FSC/MMAC records are loaded before  relocation. 1.3.1.2.5.5.

Part 1 covers  day 120 through  25 (120-25) 1.3.3.1.2.  Part 2 covers  day 25 through  day 0 (25-0) 1.3.3.1.3.  Part 3 is  0-day conversion 1.3.3.1.4.  Part 4 covers  the run  of mandatory  reports  and management  products. 1.3.3.2.  Part  1 - 120-25 Day  Conversion  Procedures.  The  conversion  upload  package  is processed  as  a  separate  entity,  and  no  other  transactions  are  input.  Any  rejects  resulting from  input  during  this  period should  be corrected and  processed before the  next  scheduled period.  The  establishment  of  a host  or  satellite  account  consists  of  multiple  steps  which must  be followed  in  the sequence  provided  in  this  section. 1.3.3.2.1.  Load the applicable  Information  Technology  (IT) system  software  using  the normal  Mobile  Satellite  Services  (MSS)  procedures.  The  DECC notifies  the  Remote Processing  Station  (RPS) operator when  the software  is loaded. 1.3.3.2.2.  Process all  normal  end-of-day  reports.  Process R03 for  normal  distribut io n. For  non-autonomous  satellite transfers,  process  those  A&F  reports  prescribed  by DFAS-DE  7077.10-M. For other  transfers,  process  all  End  of  Month  (EOM)  reports AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 33 and those  A&F reports prescribed  by DFAS-DE  7077.10-M. Note:  If  it  is determined that  resizing  is  necessary,  follow  all  instructions  Para  1.3.4 below.  If  it  is  determined that  resizing  is not  necessary,  proceed to Para  1.3.3.2.6. 1.3.3.2.3.  Run  NGV027, Fail  Safe. 1.3.3.2.3.1.  Correct all  errors before  continuing. 1.3.3.2.3.2.  Label  the  list  BEFORE  CONVERSION. 1.3.3.2.4.  Process an IRUDUMP  to dump  Data Base Area to Tape Label  the file  dump PRIOR TO REHOME/ADD  NEW ACCOUNT.  Note:  If it  is determined  that  resizing is  necessary,  follow  all  instructions  Para  1.3.4 below.  If  it  is  determined  that  resizing is  not necessary,  proceed to Para  1.3.3.2.6. 1.3.3.2.5.  A complete  resizing  of  the gaining  CSB existing  computer  data base record area should  be considered  at this  point.  Failure  to resize  can  result  in  many  problems (For  example,  too many  data base  records  for  the  space  allocated  will  reduce  system performance).  To determine  if  resizing  is  required,  take the  following  steps: 1.3.3.2.5.1.  Use  the  NGV027  instructions in  Para  1.3.3.2.3  above  and  the NGV027 of the affected  satellite(s)  to add the individual  record area totals  together.   If it  is  determined  that a resize  is necessary,  follow  the steps outlined  in  Para 1.3.4 below. 1.3.3.2.6.  Establish  applicable  IT system  Terminal  Security. 1.3.3.2.7.  Load applicable  IT system  areas. If  gangs  2 through  4 are being  loaded,  it  is not  necessary  to  do  the  initial  load  of  IT  system  areas.  However,  if  this  is  the  only applicable  IT  system  database  on  the  system,  then  the  initial  load  of  IT  system  areas must  be  completed.    Enter  the  following  command:  @START  0GV0*DBRUN$.L-LOAD/SYSAREAS  (RUNID  = SYSLOD) 1.3.3.2.8.  Load  Base  Constants.  Process  NGV068A  or  NGV068B,  Base Constants/Terminal  Load 1.3.3.2.9.

The  conversion upload  package  is  processed as a separate  entity  and  no other  transactions  are input.  Any rejects resulting  from  input  during  this  period  should  be corrected and processed before  the next  phase.  Most of  the inputs  at this  point  in  the  conversion  process were made  from  the pre-conversion  item,  Para.   1.3.3.3.5 through   1.3.3.4.1  of  this  section.  The  steps  which follow  process all  the  required  phrases  and  the  remaining  support  data. Create  these  data files  on  the  system,  then  load  and  process  them  through the  pseudo.  For  additiona l information  on pseudo processing,  see AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 3.

At this  point,  the  manual  account  is converted,  but  certain  reports,  management  products,  and  listings  must  be  run  for accounting/audit  trail  purposes.  In  addition  to  the  mandatory  End  Of  Day  (EOD)  reports and  any  required  major  command  management  products  which  were  specified  in  the conversion  instructions,  the  following  programs  must  be run:  M36, Accounting & Finance (A&F)  Stock  Fund  Due-Out  Report  (options  1,  2,  3,  4,  and  5),  R14,  Custodian Authorization/Custody Receipt Listing, R20, Readiness Spares Package (RSP) Availability Report, R22, Conversion Audit List and R02, Interchangeable and Substitute Listing. Also at  this  time,  any  standard  release  programs  received  during the  conversion  must  be reloaded.  The  actions  listed  below  complete  the conversion  process. 1.3.3.6.  Since  the  conversion  program  suppressed  all  normal the  R22 becomes  the  auditable  document  for  accounting  purposes.  The  following  statement,  with signatures,  will  be affixed  to the last  page  of the  listing: transactions, 38 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 Figure  1.1.

Process  the  M20 as  soon  as possible  so that  the SMAG  manager  can submit  a revised  AFSF operating  program.  1.3.4.  Resizing the Database. the  database records tape run  will  download 1.3.4.1.  Resizing  Procedures.  Before  resizing,  you  must  first  download  the  database. The following file xGV0*DBDWNLD.  It then  rewinds  the tape, sorts the records by executing  NGV058, and then  writes  the  sorted  output  to tape file  xGV0*GV-xTP.  X equals  primary  gang.  Before downloading  the database,  it  must  be as free  as possible  of errors.  The  download  program (NGV057)  will  run  with  limited  pointer  errors;  however,  page errors  will  abort  NGV057. First  verify  your  database with  Data Management  Utility  (DMU)  and NDA500. Remember to ensure  all  users  are advised  ahead  of time  and do not attempt  to utilize  the  system  until after  all  resizing  procedures  have  been  completed. to  a  cataloged 1.3.4.1.1.  Process  all  pseudo  inputs  and  run  any  required  SIFS  utilities  to  clear  out SIFS data. 1.3.4.1.2.  Process  RPTRUN  (crossover)  on  the  primary  and  process  all  mandatory reports on the  secondary  including  RPTEON  on the secondary. 1.3.4.1.3.  Process  all  mandatory  reports,  including  RPTEON,  on  the  primary.  Note: Important;  do  not  initialize  BOD  (beginning-of-day).  There  can  be  no  transactions during  these  resize  procedures. 1.3.4.1.4.  Process the following  jobs. Ensure  they  are error free  before continuing  with the  next  step: AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 39 Figure  1.2.  Required  Jobs for the NGV057 Program.  1.3.4.1.5.  Once  the  above  steps  have  been  accomplished  error  free,  download  the database.  This  run  downloads  the  database  to  tape,  rewinds  the  tape  for  reading  by NGV058,  then  writes  the  sorted  records  to  a new  tape  file  called  xGV0*GV-xTP.  x equals  primary  gang.  @START  0GV0*DBRUN$.DNLOADx 1.3.4.1.6.  After  this  job  finishes,  print  your  output.  Visually  compare  record  totals downloaded  against  the  output  from  Verify/GV-x.  Totals  for  most  records  should match.  Not  all  records  are  downloaded  because  some  are  re-created  by  the  upload program.  Also  members  or  records  belonging to  empty  sets  are  deleted  on  the download.  As stated,  download  will  walk  the  owners  through  the  members.  One thing to  keep  in  mind  or  check  for  is  blank  stock  numbers  on  the  ITEM-RECORDS. Although  NGV057  will  download  these  records,  NGV052  will  NOT  upload  these records  because  the  CALC  key  is  built  from  the  101-STOCK-NUMBER  and  101-SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR.  If  the  DNLOADx  aborts  or  a  restart  is  required  for  any reason,  just  restart  DNLOADx.  As  stated  earlier,  the  DNLOADx  does  not  delete  or modify  database records. 1.3.4.2.  Executing  NGVU31.  NGVU31  reads  and  resizes  the  schema  absolute  SBSS-SCHEMA  based upon  input  from  the RPS operator. NGVU31 is menu-driven  and manual intervention  of the  output  files  should  not be done. NGVU31 interfaces  with  NDAU31  for schema  modification.  Manually  processing  NDAU31  can  cause  disastrous  results. Therefore,  SBSS will  use  NGVU31  to resize  their  applicable  schema.  Prior  to executing NGVU31,  save  your  catalog  statements  from  your  DBRUN$  file.  NGVU31  will  not  put your  disk  assignments  on  your  new  catalog  elements.  If  you  don't  use  disk  assignme nts, then  there  is  no need to save  these  elements.  The  reason  we don't  use the disk  assignme nts is if  your  database administrator  (DBA)  has all  disk assignments  set to a particular  size,  the new  sizes  may  affect  other  files  on that  pack/disk. 40 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 1.3.4.2.1.  NGVU31  may  be executed  anytime  and  the  ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA run  can  be  processed  later.  Personnel  may  size  the  area(s)  in  the  morning  and  not actually  install  the  new  sizes  or schema  until  later.  The  only  run  that  changes  sizes  or areas  is  the  element  created  in  the  file  0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.ACTIVATE/SBSS -SCHEMA.  NGVU31  can be executed  many  times,  but actual  database sizing  changes will  not  take  place  until  the  ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA  is  processed.  You  must process NGVU31 with  a nonexempt  user-ID. Figure  1.3.  Keyin and  Options  for  NGVU31. 1.3.4.2.2.  After  selecting  the  appropriate  option  and all  prompts  have  been  answered, do the  following  to create  0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.  This  file  contains  the  new  resized SBSS-SCHEMA absolute  and all  updated  elements  to activate  your  new  sizes.  Figure  1.4.  Creating  0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.  the  new  catalog  statements 1.3.4.2.3.  To install  new  Universal  Data System  (UDS) and SBSS-SCHEMA, process the  @START  and  the  @ADD  statements  below.  Also  DO NOT  start  this  run  if  your DMC has a UDS dump  or UDS reload  scheduled.  It will  not work. This  run  will  update the UDS. It will  copy the  SBSS-SCHEMA into  your  DMS$<ALN>*SBSS-SCHEMA. file  and  copy  all @START  0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA           Note:  Review the  PR  for  errors.  Breakpoint  file  is  0GV0<ALN>*DELSBS.  Errors  are  OK  here because  the  program  may  be  trying  to  delete  a  file  that  does  not  exist.  Also,  the breakpoint  file  0GV0<ALN>*INSTALL.  must  have 0-Fatal, 0-Errors on the INSTALL and EXPORT  portion  only.  If  you  have  a warning,  go to that  line  and  determine  if  the warning  was  serious.  It will  show  you  if  that  instruction  was successful  or not.  There are  too  many  warnings  to  list.  Therefore,  determine  which  type  of  warning  it  was. REMARKS  are okay. Register  the new  SBSS-SCHEMA  just  resized  via  NGVU31 by processing  the  following:  @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR into  your  0GV0*DBRUN$.  file.        the  catalog  statements 1.3.4.2.4.  Review in  your  0GV0*DBRUN$.  file  for  the particular  gang  you  resized.  They  must  have  the  new  sizes  in  the  resized  areas.

This  job  will read the  tape created by the DNLOADx  program.  The  upload  may  take anywhere  between 2  and  6  hours  to  complete  based  upon  the  size  of  your  database  and  system  saturation. NGV052 will  be the longest  running  upload  program  because  this  is the  one that  stores all the item  details.  After  upload,  be sure to verify  your  database. This  list  should  be compared with  the one before the download.  As stated earlier,  there will  be some records not reloaded. Since  some  application  programs  may  leave  empty  sets  or orphan  records  on  the  system, they  will  not  be uploaded.  Before  starting  your  UPLOAD,  ensure  you  modify  your  new catalog  (@CAT) statements  in  0GV0*DBRUN$.  Process the  following  jobs  to reload  the database: Figure  1.5.  Modifying  New Catalog Statement in  0GV0*DBRUNS.  1.3.4.3.1.  For the  ACCOMMODATE  option,  after  you  have  processed the  runstream ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA,  you  have  to  use  ACOPY  to  reload  the  incoming database. 1.3.4.4.  Resizing  TXHIST-GV  Area.  The  transaction  history  area does not  belong  to any set and does not  point  outside  itself.  The  download  and upload  procedures are not required to resize  this  DMS area. This  section  will  cover the steps required  to resize  your  TXHIST-GV area. The  storage  method  used for  this  area is DMS-CALC. 1.3.4.4.1.  Presizing  Procedures.  Process  all  reports,  including  RPTEON  on  your secondary  gang.  Your  secondary  gang  must  be closed  out: 42 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 1.3.4.4.1.1.  @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DOWN/GV-x  (x = secondary  gang  number) 1.3.4.4.1.2.  @ADD  0GV0*DBRUN$.DELETE/GV- x number) (x  =  secondary  gang 1.3.4.4.2.  Process all  reports, including  RPTEON on your  primary  gang.  Your  primary gang  must  be closed  out. DMS-CALC uses  the  input  901-STOCK-NUMBER to store the  901  records,  then  processes  the  following  jobs.  x  equals  primary  gang  number:       @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.NGVU31 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x   @ADD        1.3.4.4.3.  Enter  option  1. NGVU31 will  prompt  for record counts.  TAB forward  to the TXN-HIST  field  and  enter  the  required  number  of  transactions.  Leave  all  other  fields on this  screen  blank.  Return  to main  menu  and enter  option  5. This  will  list  your  track sizes  for  the  TXHIST  area. If  you  entered  the  wrong  counts,  take option  1 and reinput your  correct  count.  When  ready, continue. Figure  1.6.  Enter  Track  Sizes Example. 1.3.4.4.4.  If you use @ASG instead  of @CAT just change  @CAT,PV to @ASG,UPV:  Figure  1.7.  File 0GV0*BRUNS. 1.3.4.4.5.  Your  TXHIST  area is  now  ready.

These  codes are defined  as follows: Table 2.2.  Reconciliation/Update  Codes. Code Explanation U R D N A centrally  computed  level  is being  provided,  or a quantity  change is  required  on a level  already  loaded. A level  receipt  acknowledgment  (XCC) has not  been received  at the XCA generating  activity. The  central  leveling  activity  has determined  that  an entire  ISG or bachelor  NSN has been  removed  from  RBL  computation.   Delete RBL  pushed  levels. A base has reported  a zero daily  demand  rate and is  no longer considered  a user  of an  item.   Delete  the centrally  computed  level. 3.  Normally  blank.  Use TEX  code A:  Used for  re-inputting  the  XCA to bypass  a 612 (XCA STOCK NUMBER  LOADED  IN ISG  WITH SUBSTITUTES) reject.    TEX  code T:   Used when  a 611 (ITEM  RECORD  NOT LOADED  FOR READINESS  BASED  LEVELING)  reject  occurs for  a stock number  that  is not loaded  in  the  ILS-S. 4. This  field  may  contain  data for  D035K purposes  but it  will  be ignored  in SBSS. 5.  The  Optional  Application  Data  field  may  be used as needed  to further identify  the reason  for  the central  level. 2.2.2.  Level Receipt Acknowledgement. 2.2.2.1.  XCC  transactions  are  used  to  acknowledge  receipt  of  an  AFMC  or  Contractor Inventory  Control  Point  (CICP) centrally  computed  stock level  at the base.  In cases where the  date of  RBL  is  greater  than  210 days  old,  the  ILS-S programmatically  initiates  follow up action  to validate  the  level.   See output   XCC transaction  format  in  Table 2.3. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 45 2.2.2.2.  When  an  XCA  transaction  successfully  processes  in  the  ILS-S,  an  XCC transaction  is produced.  When  the ILS-S inline  follow  up program  is processed and a RBL exists  with  a date of  approval  greater  than  210 days  ago, the  ILS-S will  generate  an XCC with  an “O”  in  position  42.  The  ILS-S will  generate  an F152 (ISG source code 9 is  loaded in  the ISG) management  notice  instead  of an XCC when  a stock number  with  an ISG source code  9 is  loaded  in  the  ISG  for  the  item.    For these  cases,  an  offline  follow  up  must  be generated  via  the  manual  creation  of  an  XCC to  AFMC or  a CICP.  Upon  receipt  of  the follow  up, the source  of  the XCA will  send the  base an  XCA to either  delete  or update  the RBL.   If  after  240 days  beyond  the  RBL  approval  date, a reply  has  still  not  received  from the  source  of  XCA, the  central  level  will  be programmatically  deleted  by the  ILS-S and a system-generated  XCC will  be forwarded  to  the  source  of  XCA.   The  XCC will  contain 99999 in  positions  25-29 and a T in  position  42.  If  the  XCC transaction  does not  pass the wholesale  system  edits,  a  7MS  reject  notification  is  returned  to  the  base.

TEX  Code.  Normally  blank.   TEX  Code C notifies  AFMC/CICP initiator  of the  XCA that  the  RBL  was loaded  with  a different  quantity  than  the  quantity  on the  XCA.  This  occurs  when  an RBL  was received  with  a quantity  greater  than  a maximum  or fixed  level.   This  precludes  the  source of  the XCA from  responding to an  XCC with  a 7MS reject  transaction.   TEX  code C should  not be used  when reprocessing  an XCA as the  result  of  a 612 (Stock Number  Loaded in  ISG with Substitutes)  reject. 2.  NSN.  Taken  from  the  original  XCA input.   If  the XCC is  manually  prepared as the  result  of  a 612 reject, ensure  these  fields  reflect  the same  information  as the  incoming  XCA.   3.  Interchangeable  & Substitute  Subgroup  Code.  Taken  from  original  XCA.  If the  XCC is  manually  prepared, these  fields  may  be blank. 4.  The  ILS-S will  normally  take this  code from  the  input  XCA.  The  ILS-S may assign  a different  code as the result  of reprocessing  XCA rejects.   The  ILS-S will assign  an O in  position  42 if  the central  level  RBL  allocation  date is greater  than 210 days and the  XCA source  either  has not  updated  or deleted  the  central  level.   The  ILS-S will  assign  a T in  position  42 when  a central  level  RBL  is programmatically  deleted  because  the date of approval  is  over 240 days.  The ILS-S will  assign  an N in  position  42 if  a base has  reported a zero  daily  demand rate and is  no longer  considered  a user  of an item.   The  centrally  computed  level is  deleted.   5.  RBL  exists  for the  NSN in  the  XCA transaction,  use code C.  If  the central level  is  not loaded  in  the  ILS-S, use  incompatibility  code I. 6.  Positions  25-29 may  contain  99999 when  the  original  XCA does not pass certain  edits  or when  manually  prepared after  an F031 (Item  Record  Source Code is Other  Than  Alpha)  management  notice  has  been worked. 7.

Centrally  Computed  Levels vs. Approved  Minimum  or Fixed Levels. 2.2.4.1.  There  are two instances  when  a centrally  computed  RBL  level  can be less  than  an approved  minimum  or  fixed  level:  1)  there  is  insufficient  worldwide  requirement to AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 49 allocate  to the minimum/fixed  level,  or 2) the  base’s minimum/fixed  level  is not registered in  the  D035E (or other central  leveling)  system.   This  section  provides  detailed  instruct io n for  identifying  and  rectifying  (where  appropriate)  these  instances.   .  Exception:  Any  item identified  as  Low  Density  Levels  (LDL)  required  in  support  of  base  communicatio ns-electronic  needs are exempt  from  insufficient  RBL  pushes.   When  approved  LDLs  exist  in D035E or other centrally  leveling  system,  the central  leveling  system  will  honor those LDL needs even  if  the worldwide  Organizational  Intermediate  Maintenance  (OIM) requireme nt is  less  than  the  sum  of the LDLs. 2.2.4.2.  When  a readiness  based level  RBL  is less  than  the  approved minimum/fixed  level quantity  due  to insufficient  worldwide  requirement,  the  RBL  level  will  be identified  with an  “S”  in  position  7 of  the  XCA  transaction.   The  ILS-S will  establish  the  RBL  level  for the  quantity  on  the  XCA  and  store  the  “S”  in  the  216-RBL-Override  field  on  the  RBL adjusted  level  detail.    An  F233  management  notice  (RBL  QUANTITY  LESS  THAN MINIMUM/FIXED  LEVEL  QUANTITIES)  and a 16L automatic  inquiry  will  be produced to notify  the LRS  CC/AO; however,  no further  action  is necessary. 2.2.4.3.  If  the  RBL  quantity  is  less  than  the  approved  minimum/fixed  level  quantity  and the  XCA  does  not  contain  an  “S”  in  position  7,  then  the  base’s  minimum/fixed  level  is probably  not  registered  in  the  D035 system,  and  therefore  not  included  in  the  worldwide (D200A) requirement.   In this  situation,  the ILS-S programmatically  initiates  the following actions: 2.2.4.3.1.  The  ILS-S will  still  establish  an  RBL  adjusted  level  detail  for  the  quantity on the  XCA input. 2.2.4.3.2.  The  ILS-S  will  generate  an  XE4  with  an  “I”  in  position  67  for  each Base/AFMC  approved  minimum/fixed  level  (type  level  A-C or  E)  loaded  to  the NSN  and  any  interchangeable  items  linked  to  the  NSN.  The  XE4  will  notify AFMC/CICP  there  is  a  mismatch  between  the  RBL  quantity  and  the  approved minimum/fixed  level.  If  the  ASL  is  base-initiated,  D035E/CICP  central  leveling system  will  compare  the  XE4 to the  RBL  database. If  the XE4 and  the  RBL  do not match,  an  ASL  Reject  Notification  (XE5)  with  reject  code “R”  will  be returned  to the  reporting  base.  This  indicates  that  the  Materiel  Manager  did  not  input  the approved  base-initiated  ASL  into  the  RBL  database.  These  rejects  need  to  be corrected  immediately  (see  Adjusted  Stock  Level  reject  notification  for  XE5 corrective  actions)  because  releveling in  the  Materiel  Management  system  is suppressed  as discussed  in  the  paragraph  below.  If  the  ASL  is  predetermined,  the XE4  will  automatically  register  (load)  the  reported  ASL  to the  RBL  database  and determine  whether  or not to perform  an out-of-cycle  RBL  allocation. 2.2.4.3.3.  The ILS-S will  suppress  releveling  on this  NSN for eight  days to give  AFMC (or CICP) time  to react  to the  mismatch.   The  four-position  Julian  date  will  be stored in  the 101-Filler-4  field  when  the XCA is  processed.  Releveling  will  compare  the 101-Filler-4  date with  the  current  computer  date and bypass  releveling  until  the  differe nce equals  eight  days.  After  the eighth  day, the  item  will  be releveled  and the  101-Filler- 4 date  will  be  deleted.    If  an  XCA  is  received  before  the  eighth  day  of  suppressed releveling  that  matches  the  base  level,  then  the  101-filler- field  (XE4  date)  will  be blanked.   At this  time,  the  RBL  will  become  the  base Requisitioning  Objective  (RO).  50 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 Note:  For visibility  of this  situation,  the 101-Filler-4  date is  located on an inquiry  next to the  heading:   “XE4  Date.” 2.2.4.3.4.  The  ILS-S  will  produce  an  F233 management  notice  to  notify  AFMC that a mismatch  condition  exists.  AFMC can use this  information  to coordinate  with their  MAJCOM RBL  monitor,  who,  in  turn,  will  coordinate  with  AFMC/CICP on the  need for an  out-of-cycle  RBL  allocation. 2.2.4.3.5.  Program  NGV915/R47  RBL  Mismatch  Report will  identify  these  mismatc h conditions.   The  R47 provides  the  capability  to list  all  stock numbers  where  the  RBL quantity  is  less  than  the  approved  minimum  or  fixed  level.    This  report  serves  as  a management  tool to help  ensure  AFMC (or the CICP) has taken  action  to register  your approved adjusted  levels  in  D035E (or the CICP central  leveling  system).   The R47 can be  used  in  lieu  of/or  in  addition  to  the  F233 management  notice.    At  a  minimum,  it should  be run  ASAP after  the  quarterly  RBL  allocation  takes place. 2.2.4.3.6.  Program  NGV917/R49  RBL  Misallocation  List  will  identify  situatio ns where  an RBL  may  be misallocated.  This  product  will  be used by AFMC to ensure that  RBLs  are  applied  properly  when  a  local  I&SG  relationship  exists  to  ensure erroneous  RO  are  not  reported  to  the  D035/CICP  central  leveling  system.  At  a minimum,  the  R49  should  be run  ASAP  after  the  quarterly  RBL  allocation  takes place.  The  specific  conditions  that  this  product  will  identify  are as follows: 2.2.4.3.6.1.  Selection  Number  1.  Items  with  an  RBL  loaded  against  the  master  or interchangeable  stock  number  and  a substitute  item  within  the  group  has  no  RBL assigned.   Corrective  action  is  taken  to determine  if  the  RBL  needs  to  be split  to allocate  a portion  of the  RBL  to the substitute  item. 2.2.4.3.6.2.  Selection  Number 2.  Items  that have multiple  substitute  stock numbers in  the  group  and  not  all  substitutes  have  an  RBL  assigned.    Corrective  action  is taken  to determine  if  the  substitute  stock numbers  without  an RBL  need  to have  a portion  of  the RBL  loaded. 2.2.4.3.6.3.  Selection  Number  3.  Substitute  item  with  an RBL  assigned  and there are  master  and  interchangeable Corrective  action  is  taken  to  determine  if  the  master/interchangeable  item  should have  an RBL  loaded  and to validate  the  RBL  on the  substitute. items  in  the  group  without  an  RBL  assigned.   2.2.5.  ILS-S XCA  Processing 2.2.5.1.  AFMC  communicates  centrally  computed  RBLs to  bases  via  XCA transactions.  There  are  a  number  of  ILS-S  edits  and  AFMC  or  LRS/Materie l Management  Activity  personnel  actions  required to  successfully  process  XCA transactions.   The  ILS-S will  edit  the XCA transactions  as follows: 2.2.5.1.1.  The  ILS-S will  check  to see  if  the  stock  number  is  loaded.  If  the  stock number  in  the XCA image  is  not loaded,  the input  will  generate  a 611 reject,  Stock Number  Not  Loaded  for  Readiness  Based  Level.  AFMC  or  LRS/Materie l Management  Activity  personnel  monitor  must  check  either  the  online  D043A  or FEDLOG  system  to  determine  if  the  stock  number  provided  by  the  XCA  image belongs  to an ISG. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 51 2.2.5.1.2.  If the  stock number  is in  an ISG and at least  one of the stock numbers  in  that ISG is  loaded in  the  ILS-S, process TRIC  FIL to load  the  stock number  and  TRIC FIS to link  the  NSNs in  a ILS-S ISG.  Reprocess  the original  XCA transaction. 2.2.5.1.3.  If  the stock number  is not  loaded in  the D043B system  or none  of  the NSNs in  the  ISG are loaded at that  base, reprocess  the XCA image  with  transaction  code “T” in  position  80.  An  XCC output  image  will  be produced  with  “99999”  in  the  quantity field,  a reconciliation/update  code of “N”  in  position  42 and a compatible/incompat ib le code “I”  in  position  58.  This  XCC will  advise  the  XCA source  that  your  base is not  a user  of the  item  in  question. 2.2.5.2.  The  ILS-S  will  check  the  item  record  for  a  numeric  parts  preference  code (NPPC) of  3,  5, or  9.  Items  assigned  these  NPPCs are  not  normally  included  in  the Readiness  Based Leveling  allocation.  If the NPPC is loaded, the  ILS-S will  produce an F031  management  notice,  and  a  BVACO9  SNUD  inquiry.  When  Stock  Control personnel  receive  an F031 management  notice,  they  must  determine  the specific  NPPC assigned  and  research  either  the  D043A  or  FEDLOG  to  determine if  the  item  is properly  coded.    However,  the  only  NPPCs that  are  actually  listed  in  FEDLOG  are NPPCs 4 and 9. If the NPPC assigned  to the NSN in  question  is a “2”  then  check to see if  the  NSN has  a phrase  code N assigned  to it  because  a phrase  code N in  the  D043A or FEDLOG  equates  to  an NPPC “2”  in  the  ILS-S. If  the  NPPC assigned  to the  NSN in  question  is  a “5”  then  check to see if  the  NSN has an acquisition  advice  code (AAC) of  Y  assigned  to it  because  an  AAC  Y equates  to an  NPPC “5”  in  the  ILS-S. AFMC will  notify  bases of items  with  a NPPC 2, 3, 4, or 5 loaded  against  them  via  a monthly listing.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  will  coordinate  with  using  activit ies on NPPC 2, 3, and 5 items  to determine  if  there is  still  a valid  requirement  and whether these  stock  numbers  should  be retained  in  the  cataloging  system  as an Air  Force used item.  If  the  NPPC stock  number  needs  to be retained,  the  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity  will  submit  an AF Form 86 with  reason code 6 requesting  reinstatement  of the stock  number.  AFMC  will  take  actions  to  delete  NPPC 2  and  5  items  which  are  not recommended  for  retention.  Customer  Service  will  contact  all  known  users  on  stock numbers  with  NPPC 3 loaded  against  them  to  ensure  that  all  assets  are  immedia te ly turned  into  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  for  disposal.  AFMC  will  take action  to delete  NPPC 3 items  once  all  assets  have  been  turn-in  by  the  LRS.  NPPC 9 items  will  be managed  by  AFMC.  (Note:   If  the  NPPC is  “4”  and  this  code does not show up in  D043A or FEDLOG,  contact your  TCTO monitor  to determine  if  the NPPC “4”  is  valid). 2.2.5.2.1.  If  you  determine  that  the  item  is  not  properly  coded, process an FCD to remove  the  NPPC and  then  notify  AFMC Stock  Control  to  reprocess  the  origina l XCA  transaction.   If  the  item  in  question  is  in  an  ISG,  consider  the  fact  that  the input  transaction  reflected  the  D043B master  stock number,  not  the base master. 2.2.5.2.2.  If  an  ISG  exists,  it  is  the  base master  that  is  coded with  the  NPPC, and  the D043B does not  have  an NPPC, then  process FIS transactions  (using  source  code 9) to change  the base master  item  to an interchangeable  or substitute  item,  as deemed  locally appropriate  (see chapter  8 for FIS processing).   After  this  is done, reprocess the origina l XCA (as reflected  on the input  image  on the F031 management  notice).   If the  D043B master  item  appears to be properly  coded with  an NPPC or if  the  item  is not  in  an ISG 52 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 and  the  NPPC appears  to  be  correct,  contact  your  MAJCOM  RBL  monitor.    The MAJCOM RBL  monitor  in  turn  will  coordinate  with  the RBL  monitor  at the wholesale activity  that  initiated  the  RBL  to verify  the  NPPC and to determine  if  the  item  should either  be excluded  from  the  RBL  allocation  or if  some  other  action  is  necessary. 2.2.5.2.3.  If  the  NPPC on  the  D043B  master  item  is  verified  as correct  or the  item  is not  in  an  ISG  and  the  NPPC is  verified  as correct,  manually  prepare  a  level  receipt acknowledgment  (XCC)  transaction  (using the  F031  input  image)  with  an  “I”  in position  58  and  a  quantity  of  99999.    Process  the  XCC  through  DLATS  and  then destroy  the  F031 notice. 2.2.5.2.4.  If  the NPPC on the D043B master  item  is  not correct or the  item  is  not in  an ISG and the  NPPC is not correct, process a stock control  data change  (FCD) to remove the  NPPC, and  reprocess  the  original  Centrally  Computed  Level  (XCA)  transaction using  the F031 input  image. 2.2.5.3.  The  ILS-S will  process the  XCA (codes R or U) in  the following  way: 2.2.5.3.1.  The  ILS-S will  set  the  RBL  Flag  on  the  item  record.   If  the  national  stock number  is  in  an ISG, the  ILS-S will  set the  RBL  Flag  ON for each  NSN in  the  group. 2.2.5.3.1.1.  The  ILS-S will  load  the adjusted  level  detail  against  the  input  national stock number  when  the  NSN is  a bachelor  item. 2.2.5.3.1.2.  The  ILS-S will  load the  adjusted  level  detail  against  the input  NSN for items  in  the  interchangeable  and  substitute  group  (master  and  interchangeab le only).   If the  ISG contains  a substitute,  a 612 reject will  be produced. 2.2.5.3.1.3.  The  ILS-S will  prepare  a level  receipt  acknowledgment  (XCC).   The NSN will  be the  same as on the original  XCA transaction. 2.2.5.3.1.4.  The  ILS-S will  blank  the  file  status  quarter  code field  and set the  item record releveling  flag  for releveling/file  status. 2.2.5.4.  The  ILS-S  will  process  the  XCA  (reconciliation/update  codes  D  or  N)  in  the following  way: 2.2.5.4.1.  The  ILS-S will  delete  the  RBL  adjusted  level  detail  for  the  input  NSN.  If the  item  is  in  an ISG, the  ILS-S will  delete  the  adjusted  level  detail  for the  input  NSN. 2.2.5.4.2.  If  any  stock number  in  the  ISG has  an RBL  loaded,  then  the  RBL  flag  will remain  on for  all  national  stock numbers  in  the  interchangeable  and substitute  group. 2.2.5.4.3.  The ILS-S will  blank  the file  status  quarter  code field  and set the item  record releveling  flag  for  releveling/file  status. 2.2.5.4.4.  If  the  item  meets  the  range  criteria  for  a demand  level,  then  the  ILS-S  will compute,  restore,  and use the  demand  level. 2.2.5.4.5.  The  ILS-S  will  prepare  a  level  receipt  acknowledgement  (XCC),  except when  the NSN is  not loaded. 2.2.5.5.  The  ILS-S  will  check  the  reconciliation/update  code for  D,  N, R,  or U  (see XCA  input  format  for  definition  of  codes).  If  the  code  is  listed  as anything  else,  the ILS-S will  produce  a  003 reject  (DOES  NOT PASS FUNDS AVAIL  EDIT).  AFMC AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 53 or  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel  must  then  verify  the  code with  the item  manager  and reprocess the  XCA with  the correct  code. 2.2.5.6.  The  ILS-S  will  check  the  Centrally  Computed  Level  in  positions  25–29  for numbers.   If positions  25–29 contain  letters  or special  characters,  the  ILS-S will  produce a level  receipt  acknowledgment  (XCC) with  99999 in  positions  25–29. 2.2.5.7.  The  ILS-S will  check the date level  computed  in  positions  75–78 to see if  the  date is greater  than  the detail  date of last approval,  and equal  to or less  than the current  computer generated  date.  If  positions  75–79 are less  than  the  detail  date of last  approval,  or greater than  the  current  computer  generated  date,  the  ILS-S  will  produce  a  level  receipt acknowledgment  (XCC) with  99999 in  positions  25–29. 2.2.5.8.  If  any  substitute  stock  number  (relationship  code S) has  an  ISG source  code equal  to 9, AFMC or LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel  must  determine  if any  portion  of the RBL  quantity  should  be applied  against  the  substitute  stock number. This  action  is  necessary  because  AFMC  and  other  central  leveling  activities  allocate RBL  quantities  on  the  D043B  master  item  for  the  entire  D043B  group  regardless  of how individual  bases have  items  linked  locally.  To make this  determination,  AFMC or LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel  must  check the  D043B system  to see if the substitute  item  is  in  the  same D043B  ISG as the base master.  If  the items  are in  the same  D043B  group,  then  the  RBL  quantity  will  have  to be divided  up among  the  base master/interchangeable  relationship  and the  base substitute(s). 2.2.5.9.  If  required,  divide  the  RBL  quantity  among  the  master/interchangeable  stock number  and  substitute  stock numbers.  AFMC or  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activit y personnel  must  prepare and process XCA inputs  against  the master  and each substitute stock number  that  has ISG  source  code 9. These  XCA inputs  must  have  a transaction code A in  position  80 and the appropriate  quantity  to be applied  to the  master  and each individual  substitute.  Note: If substitute  items  exist  with  ISG source code other  than  9, then  no  manually  prepared  XCA  is  necessary  because  these  items  will  either  get  an RBL  themselves  or SNUD ISG processing  will  change  them  to interchangeable  items. The  sum  of  the  quantities  on  these  XCA  inputs  cannot  exceed  the  quantity  on  the original  XCA.  Personnel  must  ensure  an  XCA is  processed against  the  master  and all substitute  stock  numbers  that  have  ISG  source  code  9,  even  if  the  quantity  is  not sufficient  to apply  a positive  level  to each stock number.  If the quantity  is not suffic ie nt to divide  among  the  master  and  all  substitute  items,  process an XCA with  a zero  level for  the  master  or  for  each  substitute  without  a  positive  RBL  level  in  the  group.  For AFMC and  CICP-managed  items,  after  the  XCA transactions  with  an A in  position  80 are  processed  (regardless  of  how  the  RBL  quantity is  divided  up),  AFMC  or LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel  must  manually  prepare  and  send  one level  receipt  acknowledgment  (XCC)  transaction  for  the  group  reflecting  the  stock number  and  quantity  received  on  the  original  XCA  transaction  (from  the  612  reject input  image).  If  this  action  is not performed  correctly,  AFMC/CICPs will  return  a 7MS reject  that  must  also be manually  worked. 2.2.5.10.  When  the  base  closure  flag  is  ON, the  RBL  central  level  will  not  be  loaded; however,  a  level  receipt  acknowledgment  (XCC)  with  99999  in  positions  25–29  and 54 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 reconciliation/update  code  N and  an  incompatibility  code I will  be  produced.   XCC  will not be produced for  RIDs  other than  Fxx. 2.2.5.11.  When  the  RBL  quantity  is  greater  than  an  approved  maximum  or  fixed  leve l loaded  at  the  base, the  ILS-S  will  change  the  RBL  quantity  to  equal  the  quantity  on  the maximum  or  fixed  level.    For  AFMC/CICP-managed  items,  the  ILS-S  will  generate  an XCC with  a C in  position  7 to notify  the  appropriate  central  leveling  system  of the  change to the  RBL  quantity.   In  addition,  it  will  generate  an  XE4  on the  maximum  or fixed  level to ensure  the  level  is  accurately  registered  in  the central  leveling  system. 2.2.5.12.  When  an  F432  management  notice  (depot  overhaul item)  is  received  and permanent  suppression  is desired,  delete  the RBL  detail  immediately  and load  a maximum adjusted  stock level  of  0.  If  the  NSN should  be ordered by immediate  level  maintena nce, i.e.,  Wing/Base  for  programmed  depot  maintenance  (PDM),  follow  the  instructions  in AFMAN 23-122, Ch 5. 2.2.6.  Central  Level Inquiry. 2.2.6.1.  When  an  AFMC/CICP-managed  NSN is  identified  that  has  at least  one  demand but  does not  have  a central  level  RBL  loaded,  the  ILS-S produces  a Central  Level  inquir y (DIC XCE).   The  procedures  for  processing  the  XCE and  the  XCE transaction  format  are detailed  in  this  section. 2.2.6.2.  A  Central  Level  inquiry  (DIC  XCE)  is  output  by  the  ILS-S during  releveling  or file  status when  an item  is identified  that has at least one demand  but does not have a central level  loaded.   Upon  receipt  of  the  XCE, the  source  of  the  RBL  will  determine  if  a central level  is  available  for  the  requested  stock number.   If  a central  level  exists,  they  will  return an  XCA.  After  the  XCA  is  generated  or if  no  central  level  is  available,  the  source  of  the central  level  will  treat the  XCE the  same  as an  XCB (see AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 5).  The  XCE transaction  format  is provided  below.   The  date the XCE was generated  is stored in  the first  four  positions  of the 101-XCE-Date field.   This  date will  be deleted upon  receipt of  an  XCA.   If  no  XCA  is  received  within  90  days  of  the  inquiry,  the  ILS-S releveling program  will  format  another  XCE  and  update  the  date  in  101-XCE-Date.    The  date  the XCE was generated  is visible  on an  item  record inquiry  next  to the heading:  “XCE  Date.”   The  LVL  transaction  input  can  be used  to  generate  an  XCE  on  an  as-needed  basis.   The LVL  transaction  format  is  provided  in  Para  2.2.40. Table 2.6.  Output  to DLATS. Pos. 1–3 4–6 7 No. Pos.

Customer  Oriented  Leveling Technique   (COLT)  Procedures. 2.2.7.1.  Purpose:  To  provide  the  procedures  and  methodology  used  by  the  Customer Oriented  Leveling  Technique  (COLT) to compute  and maintain  centrally  computed  stock levels  for  Non-AF-managed  items. 2.2.7.2.  COLT computes  base  stock levels  for  Non-AF-managed  consumable  (XB3)  and equipment  (NF1) items.  COLT uses  a marginal  analysis  method  to assign  levels  items  that provide  the  best  reduction  in  expected  backorders  per  dollar.  Its  logic  considers  DLA support  levels,  demand  variability,  demand  rates,  pipeline  times,  unit  price,  and  other factors  to  minimize  expected  backorders.  This  section  describes  how  the  COLT  system works and how  the ILS-S receives  and implements  COLT levels. 2.2.7.2.1.  The  overall  objective  of COLT is to minimize  base-wide  unit  customer  wait time  per  given  investment.  COLT  does  this  by  minimizing  time-weighted  expected backorders  (EBO)  per  dollar.  CWT  is  then  computed  as  EBO/Daily  Demand  Rate across all  items  for  the  base account.   This  results  in  COLT providing  Air  Force bases with  a  collective  set  of  stock  levels  that  will  produce  the  lowest  base-wide  unit customer  wait  time  (CWT) across all  Non-AF-managed  items  for the given  investme nt. 2.2.7.2.2.  Most of the COLT processes are managed  centrally  by the AF COLT Team.   This  team  is managed  at AFMC with  team  members  at several  locations. 2.2.7.3.  Centrally  computed  COLT  levels  override  base  computed  stock  levels  and  any existing  adjusted  stock levels  (ASL)  and become the basis  for base peace-time  consumable item  stock requisitioning.   However,  COLT will  honor  existing  ASLs  when  computing  its levels.  For items  without  a centrally  computed  COLT level  that  meet  the  range  criteria  for a base computed  stock level,  the  ILS-S will  continue  to calculate  and  use  base computed stock levels.   Thus,  sometimes  the  base supply  system  computes  the  initial  level  until  the quarterly  COLT level  is computed  and  overrides  it. 2.2.7.4.  The  computation  of  COLT  levels  considers  both  base-level  usage  data  and resupply  pipeline  times,  including  depot delay.  As shown  in  Figure  2.3 the  COLT process considers  all  parts,  wholesale  and  retail,  of  the  inventory  pipeline  –  not  just  the  base portions.  The  COLT  process  uses  base specific  data to  determine  the  optimum  levels  for minimal  base-wide  unit  customer  wait  time  per investment.  There  are two primary  sources of data for  COLT:  the Air  Force Supply  Centralized  Database  and the  Depot database. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 59 Figure  2.3.  COLT  Pipeline  Model.  2.2.7.5.  The  input  data from  the  Air  Force Supply  Centralized  Database provides  most  of the  COLT  input  data  referred  to  as  the  COLT  Input  File.  Data  from  SBSS accounts  are provided  to the  Centralized  Database  daily.  So by obtaining  data from  this  source,  COLT is  getting  actual  base data  for  each  base without  having  to go  through  the  MAJCOMs  or bases. 2.2.7.5.1.  The  COLT Input  File  is  a comma-delimited,  variable  length  file.  Table 2.8 provides  the  record layout. Table 2.8.  COLT  Input  File Format.

COLT  leveling  applies  to  most  Non-AF-managed  consumable  items  (XB3)  and equipment  items  (NF1). Thus  COLT  levels,  DLA,  GSA,  and  other  services  consumable items;  it  does  not  level  C-ICP items.  An  item  must  have  a positive  cumulative  recurring demand  to  be  considered  for  a COLT  level.  In  addition,  COLT  does  not  produce  stock levels  for  items  with  stockage  priority  code (SPC) E  or acquisition  advice  codes  (AACs) F, V or Y. Items  that  do not receive  a COLT level  will  be considered  for levels  by the SBSS retail  system.  It is important  to note  that there  is a difference  between  not being  considered 62 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 for a level  by COLT and receiving  a COLT level  of 0. Items  meeting  the criteria  above will receive  a COLT level,  but  that level  will  sometimes  be 0. In determining  the levels,  COLT weighs  numerous  factors  for  every  item  and  optimizes  across all  considered  items  for  that stock record account  number  within  a given  cost target.  Sometimes  it is  better to provide  a zero level  on one item  so that  other  items  can receive  greater  stock levels.  Any  backorders on  the  first  item  will  be  more  than  offset  by  the  availability  of  other  items  due  to  their increased  levels. 2.2.7.7.  COLT  is  processed  quarterly  by  AFMC  for  each  base  running  COLT.  To spread the workload,  COLT levels  are computed  for  one-third  of the  bases each month of  the  quarter.  The  COLT input  data is  extracted  during  the  third  week of  each month and  the  levels  computed  immediately  afterwards.  The  AF  COLT  Team  reviews  all levels  to ensure  the model  is operating  properly  and the computed  levels  are reasonable. The  levels  are  then  provided  to MAJCOMs  for  their  optional  review.  Afterwards,  the levels  are sent  to the  base via  DAAS for  automatic  loading  into  the  ILS- S. 2.2.7.7.1.  The  AF COLT Team  communicates  centrally  computed  COLT levels  to the ILS-S via  electronic  transactions  (TRIC  XCA).  Note:  the  COLT  reorder  point  (ROP) is  also  transmitted  on  the  XCA  transaction.  The  XCA  transactions  are  transceived through  DLATS.  After  the COLT transaction  passes internal  edits,  the ILS-S loads  the COLT level  on a type F adjusted  stock level  detail.  The  application  SRAN tasking  field has  “COLT”  in  the  first  four  positions.  The  COLT  levels  will  always  be sent  to bases on the AFMC master  NSN for items  coded as interchangeables  (I) in  an interchangeab le and  substitute  group  (I&SG).  Items  in  I&SGs  but  coded as  substitutes  (S) are  treated as  bachelor  items  for  COLT  processing.    Refer  to  Para  2.2.1  for  XCA  processing procedures. 2.2.7.7.2.  COLT levels  must  differ  from  the  existing  COLT level  by more  the  square root of the  existing  level.  During  level  computation,  if  the  model  deems  an item  should be assigned  a level  equal  to the  existing  level  minus  the  square  root,  the  level  will  be increased  to  equal  the  existing  level.  That  item  will  continue  to  compete  for  levels. However,  unless  that  item  receives  more  than  the  existing  level  plus  the  square  root, it will  not change.  If  the model  determines  the desired  level  is  within  a square  root of the existing  level  (from  existing  level  – sqrt[existing  level]  to existing  level  + sqrt[exist ing level]),  then  the  existing  level  will  not  change.  This  rule  provides  for  stability  by preventing  trivially  small  changes  to the  level,  which  can  cause  requisitions,  excess, and workload  for little  gain. 2.2.7.8.  COLT has several  constraints  (caps) to control  the depth  of leveling. 2.2.7.8.1.  Stockage  Priority  Code (SPC)  5  items  are  capped  at  the  existing  on  hand balance.  If  there  is no on-hand  balance,  then  the  COLT level  will  be forced to zero. 2.2.7.8.2.  The  total  COLT level  is  capped at $4K extended  cost (if  the  SBSS demand level  = 0) or $5K more than  SBSS demand  level  (if  the SBSS demand  level  > 0). COLT will  sometimes  provide  significantly  more  depth  of  levels  than  the  SBSS  computed demand  level.  Doing  so can produce stockage problems  and requisition  rejections.  This cap reduces  the  likelihood  of those  events. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 63 is  stopped  when 2.2.7.8.3.  The  COLT  leveling the  COLT  computed  expected backorders (EBO) are less  than  0.0027 (about one demand  per year). This  cap prevents the  model  from  continuing  to assign  levels  to  an  item  when  the  projected  backorder days  are  less  than  1  per  year.  That  is,  it  stops  when  the  model  is  receiving  minima l returns. 2.2.7.8.4.  COLT uses the same  economic  order quantity  (EOQ) as the SBSS-computed demand  level,  which  is  capped at one  year’s  demand  quantity.  COLT  also  constrains the COLT reorder point  (ROP) to one year’s  demand  quantity.  These caps are designed to prevent  overstocking. 2.2.7.8.5.  COLT uses the  same  Shelf  Life  Code (SLC) as SBSS.  COLT uses the  SLC to look  up  the  number  of  days  of  shelf  life.   This  is  multiplied  by  the  Daily  Demand Rate times  ½.  The  resulting  value  is the  COLT SLC cap. 2.2.7.8.6.  There  are several  rules  in  COLT that  restrict  when  to start  leveling  an item. As described  in  the  COLT item  identification,  items  with  certain  AACs  or with  a SPC E will  receive  no COLT level.   Below  are additional  rules. 2.2.7.8.7.  COLT  restricts  stock  levels  for  IEU  items  (FSG  84  and  FSC  4240)  and HAZMAT  items  (IEX  9). COLT only  provides  levels  on  these  items  if  SBSS demand level  > 0. In addition,  COLT will  not stock  any  item  with  a Max Level  of  0 or an SPC of  E.  This  restriction  accommodates  MAJCOM  policies  limiting  the  use  of  IEU  and HAZMAT  items  in  SBSS. 2.2.7.8.8.  COLT has an  initial  leveling  rule  to prevent  initially  stocking  an item  when the chance  of a future  demand  is small.   COLT will  push  a 0 level  on these  items.   The criteria  are:  Number  of  User  Demands  are  0 or 1, bench  stock  level  is  0, date  of  last demand  older  than  90 days  or date of first  demand  less  than  365 days  old, no  on hand balance,  not  SPC 5, and not  MIC 1.  Any  item  meeting  all  these  criteria  will  receive  a 0 level. 2.2.7.8.9.  COLT  has  an  “exclusion/zero”  list  maintained  by  the  AF COLT  team, modified  by  the MAJCOMs/AFMC  that  excludes  items  in  identified  federal  stock classes  (FSC)  at  identified  bases  from  receiving  positive levels.  Additions  or changes  are approved  by MAJCOMs/AFMC and  sent to the  AF COLT Team.  The AF COLT Team  will  review  and  update  the  database. If  an item  is  from  the  listed FSCs at  the  listed  base,  then  COLT  will  push  a  0 level.  This  keeps  entire  stock classes  from  receiving  positive  levels  even though  they  might  have  demands.  If  the exclusion/zero  list  forces a zero  level,  then  when  the COLT level  is loaded,  an “X” will  be placed  in  position  6 of  the  application  SRAN tasking  field  on  the  Type  F COLT ASL. 2.2.7.8.10.  If  a base closure  flag  is  set on an item,  COLT will  not provide  a new  level for it  and will  delete any  existing  COLT level.   SBSS will  take over and set the demand level  to 0.  The  0 demand  level  will  prevent  replenishment  requisitions;  however  due outs  and  Adjusted  Stock Levels  will  still  be replenished  and considered  as part  of  the requisitioning  objective.   The  base closure  flag  can be used for  mission  changes  where an item  is no longer  going  to be used  on that  base. 64 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 2.2.7.9.  Below  are rules  that  override  the  COLT  logic,  forcing  a level  more  or  less  than COLT would  otherwise  compute. 2.2.7.9.1.  There  is  an  exception  for  Mission  Impact  Code  (MIC)  1  and  Stockage Priority  Code (SPC) A items.  COLT guarantees  a positive  level  on these  items  (unless they  have  an  SPC 5 assigned  with  no  on-hand  assets).  This  ensures  In  addition,  if  the COLT  level  is  greater  than  1, then  the  reorder  point  is  set  to  at least  1.  Further,  the ROP is  set  to at  least  2 if  the  level  is  at greater  than  2 and  the  pipeline  quantity  is  at least  2. These  rules  ensure  these  critical  items  are likely  to have  some  stock availab le to prevent  MICAPS. 2.2.7.9.2.  COLT  will  honor  approved  adjusted  stock  levels.  COLT will  assign  levels that  are  at  least  equal  to  the  approved  minimum  level  quantity,  no  more  than  the approved  maximum  level  quantity,  or  a  quantity  equal  to  the  approved  fixed  level loaded  at the  base. 2.2.7.9.3.  COLT considers  bench  stock and consumable  readiness  spares  packages  in its  leveling.  So  consideration  of  bench  stock/CRSP  is  required  to  provide  the  best overall  support  to the customer.  COLT considers  an average  of 75% of the  bench stock plus  CRSP level  to be on-hand  to reduce  backorders. 2.2.7.9.4.  COLT  uses  the  standard  SBSS  mission  change  details  (see  Para  2.2.9)  to modify  demand  for  changing  missions.    The  DDR  is  either  increased  or  decreased appropriately  prior  to any  COLT computation. 2.2.7.10.  COLT  has  a  special  pre-processor  for  the  Air  Mobility  Command  (AMC) Forward Supply  Location  (FSL) Spares. 2.2.7.10.1.  Forward  Supply  Locations  (FSLs)  are  part  of  the  AMC  Forward  Supply System  (FSS)  and  provide  stock  in  the  AMC  Strategic  Airlift  en  route  system supporting  the  C-5 and C-17 strategic  airlift. 2.2.7.10.2.  The  FSL  Pre-processor  uses  special  FSL  logic  to  compute  a  level  and passes that to the primary  COLT model.   When  COLT levels  are computed  for the base, FSL levels  are treated  like  ASLs  that  must  be met.   In order to determine  which  items to level,  a candidate  file  is required.   The  candidate  NSNs and FSLs are determined  by AMC and are an input  to the  COLT computational  process. AMC provides  a quarterly file  to COLT containing  all  applicable  stock  numbers  by  FSL category.   The  file  also contains  data on percentage  of demands  from  the FSS (vice  regular  base) and two-year demand  values.   The  FSS logic  uses  both  individual  base data, and  FSS-wide  data  to determine  levels.   The  logic  has  been  in  use  at  AMC  and  is  similar  to  logic  in  RBL (D035E)  for  AF-managed  items.    The  COLT  FSS  logic  uses  a  proactive  demand forecasting  algorithm; that  is  an  FSL  can  receive  positive  levels  where  there  is sufficient  likelihood  of  future  need based on historical  fleet-wide demand. 2.2.7.10.3.  When  COLT levels  are loaded,  the  application  SRAN tasking  field  on  the Type  F ASL has “COLT”  in  the  first  four  positions.   If the  FSL logic  drives  the  levels, then  position  6 will  have  an “F”. 2.2.8.  Proactive  Demand  Leveling  (PDL)  Program. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 65 2.2.8.1.  Provide  the  procedures  and methodology  used by the Proactive  Demand  Leveling (PDL)  Technique  to compute  stock levels  for  DLA-managed  sparsely  used  items. 2.2.8.1.1.  This  narrative  describes  how  the  PDL  system  works  and  how  the  ILS-S receives  and  implements  PDL levels. 2.2.8.1.2.  The  overall  objective  of PDL  is  to reduce  the  number  of  cause  code A (and B) MICAPs on DLA-managed  consumable  items.   Items  with  little  or no demands  and no level  at a particular  base can have MICAPs, often  a significant  portion  of the MICAP incidents  and hours.   PDL tries  to predict  which  items  might  have  a future  MICAP and place levels  there in  advance  of the demands.   PDL does this  by using  demands  at bases using  the  same  weapon  system  as a base targeted  to potentially  receive  levels.   Since the target base has little  or no demands,  the other bases “donate”  their  demand  histories.   PDL uses this  demand  data along  with  MICAP information,  and unit  price to determine if  an item  will  actually  be leveled. 2.2.8.1.3.  The  basic  PDL  logic  does  the  following.    Potentially  level  an  item  at  a targeted  base if: 2.2.8.1.3.1.  A sufficient  number  of bases in  the enterprise  have  used an item  in  the past 2.2.8.1.3.2.  And  those bases use the  same  weapon  system  as the  targeted  bass 2.2.8.1.3.3.  And  the item  has caused  a MICAP in  the past 2.2.8.1.3.4.  And  the item  is economical 2.2.8.1.4.  Most of the PDL processes are now managed  centrally  by the AF PDL Team. 2.2.8.2.  Although  PDL is  a standalone  model,  it  uses  some  COLT data in  its  computatio n and  it  uses  the  COLT  system  to  push  the  resulting  levels  to the  base. PDL  runs  as  a pre- processor to COLT, using  a special  PDL data file  (Table  2.10) as well  as COLT input  files (Table 2.8) to compute  the PDL levels.  Those  levels  are passed to COLT which  treats them like  minimum  ASLs. That  is, COLT starts leveling  at the  PDL quantity  (rather  than  0) and could  allocate  more  to the  item.  Although  it’s  rare for  COLT to allocate  more  since  there is  little  or no local  demand.   The  final  level  is  pushed  to the  base by COLT. 2.2.8.3.  PDL  is  limited  to  Non-AF-managed  consumable  items.   There  are certain  items that  are  excluded  from  consideration.   Since  PDL  is  using  enterprise-wide  demands,  the definition  of  what  to consider  is  also  required. 2.2.8.3.1.  Certain  items  are excluded  from  consideration: 2.2.8.3.1.1.  Hazardous  material  items  are excluded.   Issue  exception  code  cannot be 8 or 9 and  the Health  Hazard  Flag  must  be blank  or 0 2.2.8.3.1.2.  “Alpha”  NIINs are excluded.   NIINs must  begin  with  a number;  NIINs beginning  with  a letter  (such  as L, N, or P) are excluded. 2.2.8.3.1.3.  Terminal  items  are excluded.   Acquisition  advice  code cannot  be V or Y. 2.2.8.3.1.4.  Certain  Federal  Supply  Classes  (FSC)/Federal  Supply  Groups  (FSG) are excluded.   Current  exclusions  include  FSC 4240, 6135, 6140, 6165, 6465, 6810, 66 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 6820,  6830,  6840,  6850,  7910,  7930,  8960,  9110,  9130,  9135,  9140,  9150,  and 9160; and  FSG 65, 80, and 84 2.2.8.3.2.  For  each  MDS/Target  Base  (or  groups  of  target  bases)  the  following information  is  required:   list  of  enterprise  bases  to  use  (called  the  donor  bases),  # of donor  bases  that  must  have  a demand,  standard  reporting  designators  (SRDs)  to  use, unit  price  thresholds,  list  of target  bases, and a unique  name.   This  information  is called the MDS Run  Definition.   If all  values  are the  same  for two different  target  bases, then the same  MDS Run  Definition  is  used for both.  However,  if  anything  is different,  then a different  MDS Run  Definition  is  required. 2.2.8.4.  PDL Process. 2.2.8.4.1.  PDL  is processed  quarterly  by the  AFMC PDL Team  for  each base and MDS  using  PDL.  The  schedule  is  the  same  as the  COLT  schedule.  COLT  levels are computed  for one-third  of the  bases each  month  of the quarter.  PDL levels  will be  computed  prior  to  the  COLT  levels  being  run  each  month.  The  PDL  data  is extracted  and the pre-processor run  right  away. 2.2.8.4.2.  An  AFMC  review  is  incorporated  into  the  process.  AFMC  will  have about  10 days  for  a joint  COLT-PDL review.  Spreadsheets  with  detailed  data  will be  provided  on  the  COLT  Enterprise  Information  System  (EIS)/SharePoint  site. The  user should  review  the  items  based on their  own criteria.  However,  the goal  of the  review  is  to make  sure  that  the  results  make  sense  and  to eliminate  items  that are  questionable.  PDL  levels  will  be  pushed  if  the  PDL  Team  is  not  notified  of changes  (default  is  to push). 2.2.8.5.  Computing  PDL Levels  Details. 2.2.8.5.1.  The PDL computation  goes through  four  steps:  Importing,  Computing  MDS results,  Computing  Target  Base  results,  and  Exporting  Data.   The  data imported  is  a special  data  extraction  from  the  AF  Supply  Central  Databank,  described  in  the  next section.   The  next  step  uses  the  PDL algorithm  to identify  potential  items  for  leveling for  any  base using  the MDS and the  demand  criteria.   The  third  step uses  the potential list  of  items  and  a COLT input  file  for  the  targeted  base  to identify  the  specific  items to be leveled  at a given  target  base.  Finally,  the  data  can  be exported  for  review  and submission  to the main  COLT model. 2.2.8.5.2.  The  PDL  data file  is  extracted  from  the  AF Supply  Central  Databank  using Oracle  scripts.    The  file  is  a fixed-width,  standard  text  file.    The  pulls  all  items  that meet  the  following  criteria: 2.2.8.5.2.1.  Budget  Code (BC) = 9 2.2.8.5.2.2.  ERRCD  = XB3  or XF3 2.2.8.5.2.3.

The  PDL  algorithm follows: is  an  enterprise-wide  demand  leveling  system  as 2.2.8.5.3.1.  If  a sufficient  number  of  bases  in  the  enterprise  have  used  an  item  in the  past 2.2.8.5.3.2.  and those  bases use the  same weapon  system  as the  “target  base” 2.2.8.5.3.3.  and the  item  has  caused a MICAP in  the  past 2.2.8.5.3.4.  Then  potentially  level  the item  at the  target  base 2.2.8.5.4.  The  sufficient  number  of  bases  is  determined  by  the  “PDL  Criteria”.   For each  MDS Run,  the number  of bases with  demands  is  provided.   Usually  it  is  referred to as X out of  Y – for  example,  3 out  of 10 bases examined  must  have  had a demand.   In this  case, the demand  means  both cumulative  recurring  demands  (CRD) and number of user  demands  (ND).  Therefore  the rule  is: 2.2.8.5.4.1.  The  number  of bases with  positive  CRD >= MDS Run  Criteria 2.2.8.5.4.2.  The  number  of bases with  positive  ND >= MDS Run  Criteria 2.2.8.5.5.  The  weapon system  is determined  by using  Standard  Reporting  Designators (SRDs)  contained  on Weapon System  Details  (WSDs).  Part of the run  definition  is  the list  of donor  bases and the list  of SRDs.  The WSDs for each donor  base are examined, pulling  out  NSNs that  have  the  identified  SRDs. 2.2.8.5.6.  A past MICAP at a base is reflected  in  the Mission  Impact  Code (MIC) being set  to 1.  So if  any  of  the  donor  bases have  a MIC 1 set  and a positive  demand  level, then  we  can  infer  the  item  has  had  a  past  MICAP  and  will  be  considered  for  PDL leveling. 2.2.8.6.  The  PDL  business  rules  further  restrict  items  to receive  PDL levels.   These  rules are used to control  cost, remove  unwanted  items,  and  improve  predictability. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 69 2.2.8.6.1.  In order to restrict  the items  considered  for levels,  an NSN being  considered must  meet  the  following  rules: 2.2.8.6.1.1.  Budget  Code (BC) = 9 2.2.8.6.1.2.

DL  has  two  Unit  Price  (UP)  thresholds:  lower  UP threshold  and upper  UP threshold;  which  are set for  each  MDS Run  Definition.   The  upper  threshold  removes all  NSNs more than  the upper threshold  value  while  the lower  threshold  removes  some additional  items  based on location  of demands.   The  lower  threshold  defaults  to $100 and the  upper threshold  defaults  to $751.  The  details  are: 2.2.8.6.2.1.  $0 < UP < UP Lower Threshold.   Potentially  level  any item  at the target base that  meets  the other  rules 2.2.8.6.2.2.  UP Lower  Threshold  < UP  < UP  Upper  Threshold.   Potentially  level an  item  at the  target  base only  if  the  cumulative  recurring  demands  are positive  at the  target  base 2.2.8.6.2.3.  UP Upper Threshold  < UP.  Do not  level  the  item  using  PDL 2.2.8.6.3.  There  are  certain  Federal  Stock  Classes  (FSCs)  or  Federal  Stock  Groups (FSGs)  that  we do not  want  to include  in  PDL.

MICAPs  on  items  that  have  other  sources  of  levels  would  not  result  in  a Cause Code A or B MICAP.  Since  PDL was designed  to reduce  Cause Code A and  B MICAPs,  these  items  are  eliminated  from  receiving  PDL  levels.    Specifically,  if  the item  at the  Target  base has any  of  the following,  it  will  not  receive  a PDL level: 2.2.8.6.4.1.  Min  Adjusted  Stock Level  (ASL) 2.2.8.6.4.2.  Fixed  ASL 2.2.8.6.4.3.  Max 0 ASL 2.2.8.6.4.4.  Bench  Stock 2.2.8.6.4.5.  Positive  Demand  Level  and not  previous  PDL caused 2.2.8.7.  If  an  item  passes  all  the  previous  rules,  it  will  receive  a PDL  level.   That  is,  if  it passes the  algorithm  checks  (sufficient  number  of bases with  past demands,  with  the  right SRDs, and a past MICAP) and business  rules  (Basic  Rules,  UP thresholds,  FSC exclusio ns, and no other  levels)  then  level  at the target. 2.2.8.7.1.  The  PDL  level  is  the  average  lot  size.    Average  Lot  Size  =  Cumulat ive Recurring  Demands  / Number  of  User  Demands,  rounded.   An  Average  Lot  Size  can be computed  for  the target  base (if  it  has  demands)  or for  the  enterprise  based on total CRD and total  ND for the  donor bases.  Below  shows  when  each  Lot Size  is  used: 2.2.8.7.2.  $0 <  UP  < UP  Lower  Threshold.    Use  the  target  base  lot  size  if  there  are demands  (CRD>0 and ND>0).  Otherwise,  used the enterprise  lot size 2.2.8.7.3.  UP Lower  Threshold  < UP < UP Upper Threshold.   Use the  target  base lot size  (since  there  must  be demands) AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 71 2.2.8.7.4.  The  PDL  level  is  capped  by  a  Max  ASL  (>0)  if  one  exists  at  the  Target SRAN. 2.2.8.7.5.  The  PDL  level  can  be  modified  by  the  Quantity  Unit  Pack  (QUP)  if  the option  is  selected.   The  QUP option  is  available  for  each  MDS Run  definition.   If  an item  has a QUP at the Target  base or any  donor base, take the largest  QUP code for  the donor and target  bases.  Convert  the QUP code into  a QUP quantity  (ex., QUP=Q, QUP Qty=100).  Take the larger  of the PDL level  and the  QUP Qty if  the QUP option  is set.  2.2.8.7.6.  If  a PDL  level  already  exists  at the  Target  base, the  new  PDL  level  will  be used as an update to that  level. 2.2.8.7.7.  If  an item  is  used  for  multiple  MDS at the  same  Target  base, the  PDL level is  computed  for each  MDS and  COLT takes the  largest  of the PDL  levels  computed. 2.2.8.8.  PDL will  delete  an  existing  level  if  all  of these  conditions  exist: 2.2.8.8.1.  Date of Last Demand  over 2 years old.  Old or no demands  at the target  base.  Don’t  delete  items  with  only  recent  demands  at the target  base 2.2.8.8.2.  Last  PDL  level  placed  over  1 year  ago.   No longer  qualifies  for  PDL.   But don’t  delete  items  that  qualified  recently  for  a PDL level  to reduce volatility 2.2.8.8.3.  First  PDL  placed over  2 years  ago.  Give  the levels  time  to work. 2.2.8.9.

Purpose:    To  explain  the  procedures  and  transactions  used  by  the  ILS-S  to generate,  load,  and  implement  a Mission  Change  or New Activation  Spares  Support  List (NASSL). 2.2.9.2.  The mission  change  detail  effective  date is the date when  the mission  change  daily demand  rates (MCDDR) and the mission  change  daily  demand  frequency  rates (MCDDFR) begin  being  used  by  the  requirements  computation  to  affect  item  demand  levels  and requisition  quantities.   The  load  dates for  mission  change  gains  must  be within  9 days  of data  collection  or  consolidation to  ensure  the  demand  data  are  still  valid.    Standard Reporting  Designator  (SRD) Demand  Data Input  1SD inputs  that  are older than  9 days will reject. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 73 2.2.9.3.  AFMC  will  coordinate  actions  if  the  base  will  use  the  override  routing identifier  code (RID)  during  requisitioning  to pass requisitions  to the losing  base at the time  of  1SD  load.  Before  the  NASSL  gaining  base  can  use  this  option,  the  effective date  must  be  past  and  the  losing  base  must  have  loss  detail  records  loaded. Requirements  computation  can  then  determine  excesses  that  may  be  shipped  to  the gaining  base. Depending  upon  the  advice  code used,  requisitions  that  cannot  be filled will  be passed or killed  by the  losing  base. Appropriate  supply  status  will  be provided.  2.2.9.3.1.  SRD-based  Consumption  Data  Source  Base  and  NASSL  Gaining  Base SRAN.  If more  than  one base is  used for  source  data, specify  the base and  SRAN that will  consolidate  the  data  using  program  R65/NGV910,  SRD  Demand  Data  Analys is and Consolidation. 2.2.9.4.  AFMC  will  manage  all  MCD  transactional/coordination  processes  and establish  a  mission  change  document  file  that  contains  all  correspondence  on  the mission  change  processing,  R37/NGV853  (SRD  Demand  Data  Analysis) listings processed to monitor  the  accuracy  of SRD data, annual  update option  of A01/NGV849 (Standard  Reporting  Designator  File)  update  which  replaces  all  previous  listings,  along with  input  and  output  from  processing  programs  NGV433  , Mission  change  special level  detail  load/change,  (TRIC  1SDHDR)  and  NGV436,  Mission  Change,  Detail Change,  (TRIC  1XT).  The  A01/NGV849  will  be processed using  the  update  option  to update  the date of first  demand  and quantity  on the  SRD record at least  annually. 2.2.9.5.  Mission  Change/NASSL  SRD-based  Consumption  Data  Collection  Process.  SRD-based consumption  data collection  is  accomplished  by the D13/NGV833, Daily  SRD Update  Program,  which  automatically  collects  data  for  all  type  organization  codes  and SRDs,  except  Znn  SRDs.    At  least  6 months  of  data  are  needed  to  calculate  a  realistic average  daily  demand  rate  on  an  item.   If  the  date  of  first  demand  recorded  on  the  SRD record  is  less  than  180 days,  then  180 days  will  be used  in  the  computations  of  the  daily demand  rate. 2.2.9.6.  When  notified,  AFMC will  process the  following: 2.2.9.6.1.  Source  Base.  Process  program  R37/NGV853  to produce  SRD  demand data  output.  (TRIC  1SD)  Make  sure  the  correct  SRD  and  base  factors  are  used. Forward the 1SD outputs,  as directed  by MAJCOM, to the gaining  base along  with a cover  letter  indicating  the  source  SRAN  and  date  prepared.  The  1SD  format  is provided  in  Table 2.11. 2.2.9.6.2.  Consolidating  Base (when  applicable).   Process program  R65/NGV910 after all  the  1SDs  are received  from  the  source  bases.  Forward the  R65  output,  as directed by  the  MAJCOM, to  the  gaining  base  along  with  a cover  letter  indicating  the  source SRAN and date prepared. 2.2.9.7.  Mission  Change/NASSL  Gaining  and  Losing  Base  Procedures.  AFMC  will manage  all  processes: 2.2.9.7.1.  NASSL Gaining  Base Procedures. 2.2.9.7.1.1.  Process NGV433.  Process program  NGV433, (Mission  change  special level  detail  load/change)  TRIC  1SDHDR  to load  the Mission  Change  Data Header 74 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 Record (gain).   The  1SDHDR  is detailed  in  Table  2.13. 2.2.9.7.1.2.  Process 1SD Images.   Process 1SD images  to load  details  on  the  date specified  by the MAJCOM.  The  load date must  be within  9 days of data collectio n or consolidation  to ensure  the demand  data is  still  valid.   1SD inputs  that  are older than  9  days  will  reject.    The  download  or  consolidation  must  be  rescheduled.   Correct any  rejected  1SD inputs  before  continuing.   The  format  for  the  1SD image is  provided  in  Table 2.11. 2.2.9.7.1.3.  Create  216  Gain  Details.   The  mission  change/NASSL  gaining  base processing  of  the  1SD  images  results  in  the  ILS-S  creation  of  a Mission  Change Special  Level  Detail  Record (216 record) with  a Type  Level  Flag  equal  to “G”. 2.2.9.7.2.  NASSL Losing  Base Procedures. 2.2.9.7.2.1.  Process  ISDHDR.   Process  NGV433,  1SDHDR  to  load  the  Mission Change  Data Header Record  (loss).   The  1SDHDR  is  detailed  in  Table 2.13. 2.2.9.7.2.2.  Process 1SD Images.   Correct any  reject  conditions  before  continuing.   The  format  for the  1SD image  is  provided  in  provided  in  Table 2.11. 2.2.9.7.2.3.  Create  216 Loss  Details.   The  NASSL  losing  base processing  of  the 1SD images  results  in  the ILS-S creation  of a Mission  Change  Special  Level  Detail Record (216 record) with  a Type  Level  Flag  equal  to “H”. 2.2.9.8.  The  ILS-S  calculates  mission  change/NASSL  gaining  and  losing  base  demand levels  for  items  with  mission  change  special  levels  using  the recoverable  and  consumable item  leveling  techniques.   However,  the  mission  change  item  daily  demand  rates  (DDRs) are  adjusted  upward  or  downward  based  upon  the  type  level  codes:  type  level  code  G indicates  an  increase,  and  type  level  code  H  a  decrease.    The  resulting  demand  levels (influenced  by the mission  change  daily  demand  rates loaded  at the  base) are stored on the item  record.  Type  level  codes G and H influence  how the  DDR  is adjusted,  as follows: 2.2.9.8.1.  If  the  mission  change  level  contains  a  mission  change  percent  base  repair (PBR)  (stored  in  tenths)  in  the  duplicate  detail  flag  field,  the  mission  change  PBR  is used  to compute  levels  under  these  conditions:   1) if  data are available  from  less  than one quarter's  repair  cycle,  or 2) if  a PBR  override  is  not  loaded  on the  mission  change detail. 2.2.9.8.1.1.  If  the  mission  change  level  contains  a PBR  override  (stored  in  tenths) in  the  project  code field,  the  override  PBR  is  used to compute  levels  regardless  of the  1) data on the  repair  cycle  record,  or 2) the  mission  change  PBR  stored on  the mission  change  adjusted  level. 2.2.9.8.2.  Three  daily  demand  rate  elements  are  computed  by  the  releveling  program and then  stored on the Requirements  Group Data Record and Requirements  Group Data Extension  Record.  These  DDR  elements  are calculated  as follows: 2.2.9.8.3.  The  net  DDR  for  all  mission  change  details  for  an  item  or group  of  items  is determined  according  to its  effective  dates, as follows: 2.2.9.8.3.1.  Effective  Date  Less  than  Current  Date.   If  the  detail  effective  date  is equal  to or less  than  the  current  date, the  net  DDR  is  stored  in  the  net  balance  of AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 75 effective  mission  change  details  of  the  extension  record.  When  the  current  date is less  than  the support  date, the remaining  days  must  equal  365 days. 2.2.9.8.3.2.  Storing  the  Net DDR.   Regardless  of  the  detail  effective  date, the  net DDR is  stored in  the net balance  of all  mission  change  details  field  of the extension record.  When  the current  date is less than  the support date, the remaining  days must equal  365 days. 2.2.9.8.3.3.  Standard  DDR.   The  standard  DDR  is  calculated  by  the  ILS-S  from recorded demand  data. 2.2.9.8.3.4.  Summing  DDRs.    Finally,  the  system  adds  to  the  standard  DDR  the mission  change  DDR.   The  sum  of  these  two  DDRs  is  then  stored  on  the  group record.  This  sum  is the  DDR used by the  ILS-S to calculate  stock levels  in  support of  the  mission  change.    The  summed  DDR  is  also  used  at  the  mission  change base/the  NASSL  gaining  and  losing  bases in  determining  reportable  excesses  and for  initiating  requisition  cancellation  requests. 2.2.9.9.  The  ILS-S  programmatically  deletes  mission  change  details  when  the  missio n support  date exceeds the  current  date by 365 days. 2.2.10.  Program  NGV547, NASSL, Requisition  Upgrade  Program. 2.2.10.1.  Program  NGV547, NASSL, Requisition  Upgrade  Program,  must  be processed if requisitions  must  be  upgraded  for  any  reason.    See  AFH  23-123, Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  6  for processing  instructions. 2.2.10.2.  Purpose:   To provide  necessary  indicative  data and accumulated  demand  data for use  by  program  NGV433 (Mission  change  special  level  detail  load/change).   These  data, together  with  the  mission-change-gain  or  loss-data  record,  will  be  used  by  program NGV433 to  establish  applicable  mission  change/NASSL  special  level  detail  records  and, if  required,  item  records. 2.2.10.3.  Must  be input  during  in-line  processing.   Program  NGV433  (TRIC  1SDHDR) must  be processed before  these  inputs. 2.2.10.4.  . Output  will  be  rejects  and/or  management  notices,  SNUD  add (DIC  BDFA), and requisitions,  depending  on options  loaded by program  NGV433. Table 2.11.

The  RIC code (positions  4–6) and data (positions  7–57) are generated  from  the  item record and repair  cycle  record of the  source  base (base where  data are collected). 2.  This  SRD  daily  demand  rate (positions  75–79) is computed  by the reports  program  from the  SRD demand  data record or the  source  base item  record, depending  on the  option selected.   Program  R37/NGV853  uses the  DDR formula.   Program  NGV710 computes  the DDR  based on the  selection  options  from  the  input  parameter  in  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 6.  The  DDR consists  of two whole  numbers  and three  decimal  positions  (xx.xxx).   Special  levels  and  additive  levels  are not considered  as part of this  computation. 3.  This  SRD  daily  demand  frequency  rate (positions  80-83) is  computed  by the reports program  from  the  source  base item  record.  Program  NGV710 computes  the DDFR  based on the  selection  options  from  the input  parameter  in  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 6.  The  DDFR consists  of four  decimal  positions. 4.  SRAN Where Data  Collected  (positions  84–87).  This  field  is  generated  by the  reports program  from  the  base constants-1  record at the base where  data were  collected  or consolidated. 5.  Date Prepared (positions  88–92).  This  field  is  generated  by the  reports program  when  the 1SD data inputs  are produced. 6.  Base Factor (positions  93–95).  This  field  is  generated  by the  reports program  from  the input  parameter. 7.  Standard  Reporting  Designator  (positions  96–98).  This  field  is  generated  by the  reports program  from  the  input  parameter  and the SRD  demand  data record. 8.  Mission  Impact  Code (position  72).  This  field  is  generated  by the reports  program  based on the  contents  of the  MISSION-IMPACT-CODE field  on the ITEM-RECORD.   This  code has the  same  criteria  as an  SPC.  Unlike  the SPC, the Mission  Impact  Code applies  to all ERRCDs  (not just  XB3 items).   The  Mission  Impact  Code is never  downgraded,  and it  is  not restricted  to backorder items. 9.  Bench  Stock Flag  (position  73).  This  field  is  generated  by the reports  program  based on the  contents  of the  BENCH-STOCK-FLAG field  on the  ITEM-RECORD.   Managers  use  this code when  deciding  on whether  to put that  item  on bench  stock or not. 10.  This  field  is generated  by the reports  program  from  the  item  record at the base where  the data was collected  or consolidated. 11.  The  application  and impact  of SPCs depends upon  whether  the gaining  base already  has the  item  record loaded  when  the  1SD is  processed.  Table 2.12. summarizes  the scenarios and impacts  of 1SD SPC values.   MAJCOMS may  want  to screen  1SDs for  SPC E and change  them  before  input.   If  the item  record already  exists  with  an SPC E, gaining  base personnel  should  consider  changing  the item  record SPC to allow  requisitioning.  78 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 Table 2.12.  1SD Stockage Priority  Code (SPC)  Scenarios.

Type  Level  Code.  This  field  must  contain  G (gain)  or H (loss). 2.  Major Command  Code.  Enter  the  two-position  major  command  code as listed  in AFH 23-123, Vol  1, Ch 2. 3.  Mission  change  or Level  Directed  by Code.  This  field  must  contain  an A (HQ Air  Force Materiel  Command),  C (Major Command),  or D (United  States Air Force). 4.  Level  Detail  Effective  Date.  This  date is primarily  used by requirements computation  while  computing  levels  and  requisition  quantities.   This  date must  be equal  to or greater  than  the  current  computer  date.  If  this  date is  greater  than  the current  computer  requisition  date at the  time  of  SRD data (TRIC 1SD) processing, the  following  applies:  a.  If  a new  item  record load occurs  during  SRD data processing,  automatic requisitioning  will  not take place  even  though  the  requisition  action  flag  (position 30) is  an R.  b.  If  the item  record is already  loaded  and has a demand  level  established, requisition  action  may  occur.   Enter  the  Ordinal  date (format  is  YYDDD,  for example,  89107).  See Note 9. 5.  Mission  Support Effective  Date.  The  mission  support  date must  be equal  to or greater  than  the  detail  effective  date.  Increased  or decreased  support  requirements are first  expected  on this  date.  After  this  date (as normal  demand  data are accumulated),  the  effect  of  the detail  DDR and  DDFR begins  to decline. 6.  System  Designator.   The  system  designator  must  be authorized.   It will  be used on all  item  record and detail  record loads. 7.  Application  Code.  This  application  code may  be blank  or contain  an alpha  or numeric  character.   If  not blank,  the code will  be used on new  item  record loads only.   This  field  will  be ignored  when  pos. 7 contains  an  H (loss). 8.  Exception  Codes.  These  fields  (positions  25-28) may  be blank.   If they  are not blank,  the exception  phrase  record must  be loaded.   These  codes will  be loaded to all input  item  records.  (This  code will  be on the mission  change  data record for use  by the  TRIC 1SD load.   Ensure  the exception  code/s are loaded prior  to processing 1SDs.) 9.  Requisition  Action  Flag.   This  field  may  be blank.   If  not, it  must  contain  an R to indicate  requisitioning  when  the  mission  change  special  level  detail  record is  loaded.  The  field  and positions  31-53 will  be ignored  under  these  conditions:  a.  The  input  type level  code (position  7) is  H (loss)  b.  When  the  detail  record is  loaded,  the level  detail  effective  date (positions  11-15) is  greater  than  the current  processing  date.  Also  see Note 4. 10.  Media  and Status  Code.  This  field  cannot  be blank  if  position  30 contains  an R; it  must  contain  an authorized  code as stated  in  DLM  4000.25-1-M, Military AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 81 Standard Requisitioning  and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP).   This  code will  be output  on all  requisitions. 11.  Supplementary  Address.  This  field  may  be blank,  contain  a valid supplementary  address, or contain  an alpha  or numeric  date significant  to the requisitioner  (if  preceded by a Y in  position  32).  This  supplementary  address will be output  on all  requisitions.   Assignment  of  a valid  supplementary  address (for example,  FBxxxx)  will  affect  signal  code assignment. 12.  Advice  Code.  This  field  may  be blank.   If  not, it  must  contain  2C, 2G, 2H, 2W, 6C, or 6X.  The advice  code will  be output  on all  requisitions. 13.  Requisition  Priority  Designator.   This  field  cannot  be blank  if  position  30 contains  an R;  it must  contain  numbers  01 through  15.  The  requisition  priority designator  will  be output  on all  requisitions. 14.  Required  Delivery  Date.  This  field  may  be blank.   If  not, it  must  contain  only numbers  and be greater  than  all  zeros.   For NASSL loads,  when  the required delivery  date field  contains  999, XO3 is  moved  to the RDD  field  of  outgoing requisitions.   When  the required  delivery  date field  is  999, the  application  field  must contain  a NASSL serial  number.   (See Note 20 below.) 15.  Project Code.  This  field  may  be blank.   If  not, it  must  contain  an  authorized project code as listed  in https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=MC-LG-02-63-24&Filter=MC-LG-02-63  When  assigned,  the  project code will  be output  on all  requisitions. 16.  Requisition  Override  System  Designator.   This  field  may  be blank.   If  not, it must  contain  01, Al-A9,  B0-B9, or C0-C9.  The  requisition  override  system designator  will  be output  on all  requisitions. 17.  Requisition  Override  Routing  Identifier  Code.  This  field  may  be blank.   If the field  is  not blank,  the  routing  identifier  record must  be loaded.  This  routing identifier  code will  be output  on all  requisitions. 18.  SRAN Where Data  Collected.   This  field  must  contain  the  SRAN of  the base where  the  1SD data was collected  or consolidated.   This  field  must  contain  numbers only.   During  processing  of  the 1SD data inputs,  the  SRAN in  positions  68-71 must be equal  to this  SRAN.  If  position  7 equals  an H (loss),  this  SRAN must  be equal  to the  SRAN loaded  for  the system  designator  entered  in  positions  21-22 of the program  select  format. 19.  Application.   This  field  cannot  be blank;  it  must  identify  the  command  letter, program  action  document,  or message  that  authorized  use or load  of the  mission change  levels.   Pos. 58 must  contain  either  an (n) M (message),  L (letter)  or P (program  action  document).   Pos. 58-67 must  be structured  in  one of  the following ways  (see Note 20 below  for  NASSL level  loads): 82 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 a.  If  position  58 equals  M (message),  positions  59-64 must  contain  all  numbers  to show  the date and time  group  of the  message.   Position  65 must  contain  a letter  from A-L to denote  the month  (A = Jan,  B = Feb, etc.);  and positions  66-67 must  contain the  last  two positions  of the  year.  For example:   if  the AETC  message  number 261800Z Dec 93 was the  authorizing  document,  positions  58-67 should  contain M261800L93. b.  If  position  58 equals  L (letter)  or P (program  action  document),  positions  59-61 must  contain  letters  to show  the command  or office  symbol,  and positions  62-67 must  contain  numbers  to show  the date, month,  and year.  For example,  if  AMC/A4 letter  dated 26 Dec 93 was the  authorizing  document,  positions  58-67 should  contain LAMC261293. 20.  The  following  information  applies: a.  For NASSL level  loads,  position  58 must  equal  N (NASSL), positions  59-66 must  contain  a NASSL serial  number,  and position  67 must  be blank.   The  NASSL serial  number  is formatted  as follows:   TYPE  NASSL  - 2 positions  numeric; MAJCOM CODE - 1st position  alphanumeric,  2nd position  numeric;  SERIAL NUMBER  - 4 positions  numeric. b.  During  inline  processing  (TRIC  1SD), the constant  NSSL and the  serial  number is  moved  to the DUO-DOCUMENT-NUMBER  field  on the  due-in  detail  record.  The  four-position  SRAN-WHERE-DATA-COLLECTED,  the constant  N, and the eight-position  serial  number  are moved  to the  application  field  on the  adjusted  stock level  detail. 21.  Suppress  SNUD Add Flag.   This  field  may  be blank  or contain  an S.  (An  S will suppress  output  of SNUD add (BDFA)  on new  item  loads during  the  inline processing  of  the 1SD data inputs.) 22.  Percent  of Base Repair  Override.   This  field  may  be blank,  contain  an A or 0-9.  Leave  it  blank  if  override  of the  computed  percent  of base repair  is  not desired.   Enter  zero to indicate  zero  percent  of base repair,  one to indicate  ten  percent,  etc.  Enter  an A for  100 percent  base repair  capability. 23.  Factor Computations  Flag.   This  field  must  be blank  or contain  a Y. a.  If  the field  is blank,  then  transaction  history  records (TTPC  4D) created during inline  processing  of the  1SD data inputs  will  show  the program  factor  (percent  of effect  the  new  detail  had on the  level)  only  on marginal  ALS reportable  items (report  code 6 or 7). b.  If  the field  contains  a Y, then  all  transaction  history  records (TTPC 4D) will show  the program  factor.   The  inline  processing  time  will  significantly  increase because  of the  additional  interfaces  with  the  requirements  computation  program. 24.  If  the Requisition  Action  Flag  field  contains  an R, then  the  Factor Computations Flag  field  (position  78) must  contain  a Y. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 83 25.  First/Next  Standard  Reporting  Designator.   This  field  must  contain  a valid  SRD that  is  loaded to the standard  equate designator  record.  For procedures  and definition  of  the standard  equate  designator  record, see AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2 Ch 8. 26.  Change  Factor.  This  field  must  contain  only  numbers  greater  than  zero,  and will  contain  the  change  factor  (no  decimal  positions).    27.  Additional  SRD  or Change  Factor Fields.   These  fields  consist  of  18 additional SRD or change  factor  fields  and must  be in  the same  format  as instructed  for positions  81-86. 28.  A maximum  of  19 SRDs and their  respective  change  factors  may  be loaded  and processed.  If  19 SRDs are not used,  then  the  last  three  positions  must  be three asterisks  (***).  2.2.12.  Program  NGV436 (Change  Mission Change  Details). 2.2.12.1.  Purpose.  To call  program  NGV436 (Change  Mission  Change  Details  and/or Flag Item  Record  for  Releveling)  to  change  special  level  detail  records  meeting  the  selection criteria  with  the  data  entered  in  the  program  select  and  parameter  images.    To  flag  the applicable  item  records for  releveling  when  position  69 contains  an R. 2.2.12.2.  Input  Restrictions.   RPS/main  system.   Must  be input  in  twilight  after  the  END input  has been processed and prior to any  report (RPT)  processing.   A complete  IRU dump must  be taken before processing  this  program.   The  IRU dump must  be reloaded  if  program abnormally  terminates  for any  reason. 2.2.12.3.  Outputs.   REJ  001  - Input  columns  with  X  below  are  invalid.    Correct  invalid condition  and reinput.   REJ 201 - NO CHANGE-TO DATA  ON SELECT  CARD.  Correct the  program  select  image  and  reinput  if  necessary.   MGT  217 - NO DETAILS  OR ITEM RECORDS  UPDATED.   After  the  ITMDTL-AREA  has been scanned,  if  no detail  records meeting  the  program  select  format  criteria  were  found  or  the  change-to  data  already equaled  the detail  record data, this  management  notice  is  generated.

This field cannot be blank and must contain all numbers. 3.  Detail Application (Tasking Document).  This field cannot be blank:  position 11 must be an L, M, N, or P, positions 12-14 must be letters/numbers,  positions 15-17 must be numbers, position 18 must be letters/numbers, and positions 19-20 must be numbers.   Changing the application field is not allowed when applied to NASSL levels. 4.  Detail Type Level Code.  This field cannot be blank; it must contain a G (gain) or an H (loss).  5.  Change-To Application (Tasking Document).  This field can be blank only when positions 69 contains an R (releveling flag) and all other change fields are blank.  When data on existing detail records are changed, this field cannot be blank, must not be equal to the application entered in positions 11-20, and must pass these edits: a.  If position 46 equals M (message), positions 47-52 must contain all numbers to show the date and time from the message cite number;  position 53 must contain a letter from A-L to denote the month  (A = Jan, B = Feb, etc.); and positions 54-55 must contain the last two positions of the year (for example, if the AETC message number 261800Z Dec 93 was the authorizing document,  positions 46-55 should contain M261800L93). b.  If position  46 equals L (letter) or P (program  action document),  positions 47-49 must contain letters to show the command  or office symbol, and positions 50-55 must contain numbers  to show the date, month,  and year (for example, if the AMC/A4 letter dated 26 DEC 93 was the authorizing document,  positions 46-55 should contain LAMC261293.  When existing detail records are changed, a new tasking document  must direct the change(s). 6.  Change-To Level Directed by Code.  This field may be blank.  If not, it must contain A (HQ Air Force Materiel Command), C (Major Command),  or D (HQ United States Air Force). AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 85 7.  Change-To Major Command Code.  This field may be blank.  If not, the first position must contain 0 (zero) or 4, and the last position must be alpha/numeric. 8.  Change-To Detail Effective Date.  This field may be blank.  If not, it must contain only numbers equal to or greater than the current  processing date. 9.  Change-To Mission Support  Effective Date.  This field can only be blank when position 69 contains an R.  Changes to application, level directed by codes, major command  code, and detail effective date must contain a mission support date.  It must contain all numbers and be greater than all zeros. 10.  Releveling Flag.  This field may be blank or contain an R.  If the field contains an R, the item record for each detail record selected will be flagged for releveling.  If selection is by SRD and changes are made to multiplier fields or other  fields, the change-to-application (tasking document)  (positions 46-55) must contain a new tasking document  (Note 5). 11.  SRD Parameter Input(s) Flag.  This field cannot be blank.  It must contain either a Y (yes) or N (no) to indicate whether  parameter inputs are following the program select inputs to change the detail record daily demand  rate.

When  parameters  are input,  the  detail  record's SRD must  be equal  to one of the  input  SRDs.   If  the SRDs are not equal,  the  detail  or detail's  item  record will  not  be selected. 2.  Multiplier.   This  field  cannot  be blank  and must  contain  only  numbers.   It consists  of a one-position  whole  number  and two decimal  positions  (decimal  point  assumed  X.XX).   This  field  is used  to increase  or decrease the  detail  records DDR  and DDFR  (for  example, to increase  the applicable  detail  record's DDR  and DDFR by 50 percent,  enter  150 and the program  will  multiply  the  detail  record's DDR and DDFR  by 1.50; to decrease the  detail record DDR  and DDFR by  10 percent,  enter  010). a.  If  selecting  specific  detail  records by SRD and the  detail  record's DDR  and DDFR  are not to be changed,  enter  all  zeros  (000) in  the  applicable  multiplier  field. b.  If  position  69 of  the program  select  image  equals  R, this  field  must  contain  all  zeros (000). 3.  Additional  SRD  or Multipliers.   Positions  7-78 consist  of twelve  additional  SRD or multiplier  fields  and must  be in  the same  format  as instructed  for  positions  1-6 (Notes 1 and 2 above). 4.  A maximum  of  39 SRDs and their  respective  multipliers  may  be selected  by entering up to three  parameter  inputs. a.  If  the maximum  (39 SRDs = 3 parameters)  is not  selected,  the  three  positions immediately  following  the  last  multiplier  must  contain  three  asterisks  (***) to denote the end of the  SRDs and multipliers. b.  If  the number  of SRDs  and multipliers  fills  a parameter  but  is not  equal  to 39, (one or two parameter  inputs),  the  parameter  input  must  be followed  by another  input  containing three  asterisks  (***) in  positions  1-3.  2.2.13.  TRIC DMC (Mission Change Detail Delete). 2.2.13.1.  Purpose:    To  explain  the  selective  deletion  of  mission  change/NASSL  details procedures  process.    TRIC  DMC  (Mission  Change  Detail  Delete)  changes  the  detail mission  support  date to the  current  Julian  date  minus  366.  TRIC  DMC does not  actually delete  the  detail,  it  merely  prepares  the  detail  for  deletion  by  TRIC  LVL;  that  is,  and  the detail  will  not  actually  be  deleted  until  requirements  computation  (releveling)  has  been performed. 2.2.13.2.

The  project code further  identifies  the reason for  the  ASL record and may  be used  to augment  support  for  a particular  project.  See https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/MC-LG-02-63/Retail%20Supply%20Team/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fsites%2FMC%2DLG%2D02%2D63%2FRetail%20Supply%20Team%2FProject%20Code&FolderCTID=0x0120004A91591652ACA14C8693DF19046D4A8C&View={2902B0C7-4E19-4B35-826D-CA7AAAD80D8A} for  authorized  project codes.  Contact HQ AFMC Enterprise  Supply  Chain  Management  for  authorized  project codes management. 10.  Type  Level  Flag.   This  entry  must  be compatible  with  positions  68 and 69.  If the  input  creates  an invalid  file  condition,  program  control  underlines  the  applicable fields  with  Xs  and outputs  REJ  001.  See Para.  2.2.16  for  more  information  on Type  Level  Flag. 11. Level  Justification  Code.  See the format  for  the appropriate  LJC (Para. 2.2.28.). This code must  be compatible  with  the  entries  in  positions  66 and 69. If the  input  creates an invalid  record condition,  program  control  underlines  the  appropriate  fields  with  Xs and outputs  REJ  001. 12. Approval  Flag.  This  code must  be compatible  with  the  entries  in  positions  66 and 68. If the  input  creates  an invalid  record condition,  program  underlines  the applicable  fields with  Xs and outputs  REJ 001. 13. Major Command  Code. For a base-initiated  request,  enter  the  MAJCOM code of the organization.  For a command  directed  level  enter  the  MAJCOM code of  the organization requiring  the level.  The  MAJCOM code is  not used for  HQ AFMC (ICP), wholesale-contractor,  or HQ USAF directed  levels. 14. Approval  Date.  If the  approval  date is left  blank  a memo  ASL  record will  be established. 2.2.16.  Adjusted  Stock Level  (asl) Change  Input  Format  (1F3C). 2.2.16.1.  Purpose:   To  provide  the  transactions  used  in  the  ILS-S  to  change  ASLs  This input  does not  affect  the  approval/validation  and review/established  dates. 2.2.16.1.1.  The  1F3  Change  Input.  AFMC  may  process  1F3  change  inputs  to update  the  quantity,  application,  sustainment   flag,  reason  why  code, SRD,  project code, level  directed  by, major  command,  LJC, approval  flag,  shop repair  capabilit y, type  level  flag,  or  fixed  level  variable  factor  on  ASL  detail  records.  The  input change  data are subject  to the  same  edit  criteria  as ASL  loads. 2.2.16.1.2.  Changing  Established  ASL  Quantities.   Establishing  higher  quantities  on established  ASL  detail  records  may  be accomplished  by preparing  a new  ASL reques t for  the  higher  quantity.    Once  received,  process  an  ASL  load  (1F3L)  transaction  to establish  a memo  ASL  detail  record  in  the  system.   Remember,  the  system  will  not allow  establishment  of  a “duplicate”  ASL  for  the  same  item  or within  the  same  group of  items  for  any  particular  organization  so  you  will  process  the  new  ASL  with  the higher  quantity  load transaction  using  a Duplicate  Detail  Override  Flag  (DDOF).  The DDOF performs  two important  functions:   (1) it allows  the loading  of the new or greater AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 93 quantity  ASL  as  memo,  and;  (2)  it  allows  the  old  or  lesser  quantity  ASL  to  support established  customer  requirements.   If the quantity  increase  is approved, you will  delete the  old  firm  ASL(s)  for  the  lesser  quantity  and  firm  up  the  new  ASL  with  the  higher quantity  with  an  ASL  approval  date  transaction  (1F3A).    See  Para  2.2.18  for  more information  on  the  approval  date.    If  the  request  for  an  increase  in  the  ASL  is  not approved,  you  will  delete  the  memo  ASL detail  record with  an ASL  delete  transaction (1F3D).  See Para  2.2.12 for  more  information  on deleting  ASL records. Table 2.19.  Input  Format  and  Entry  Requirements  Screen 1F3C/366. Remarks/Notes 1F3 No. Pos.

Guide  To Assigning The Type Level Flag  (TLF). 2.2.21.1.  Purpose:   To define  the  different  types  of  ASLs  and  the  criteria  and guideli nes for  assigning  type  level  flags  to the  ILS-S ASL detail  records. 2.2.21.2.  Types  of  Adjusted  Stock  Levels.   There  are  three  different  types  of  Adjusted Stock  Levels  available  in  the  ILS-S:    minimum;  maximum;  and  fixed.    The  following paragraphs  describe  the  different types  and  common  usages  of  ASLs  in  the  ILS-S, distinguished  by the  Type  Level  Flag  (TLF). 2.2.21.2.1.  Minimum  Levels.   A minimum  ASL  is  one  of  the  more  common  types  of ASL  used in  the  ILS-S and is  defined  as the minimum  quantity  of  an item  required  to be available  to support  operations--regardless  of  demand  activity.   In  other  words, use minimum-type  ASLs  when  the requirement  dictates  “no  less  than”  a specified  amount of  stock (stockage  floor)  available  to satisfy  requirements.   The  following  paragraphs provide  a brief  description  of the  three  different  types  of minimum  ASLs  available  for use. 2.2.21.2.1.1.  Minimum  Level  - Type  Level  Flag  A.   Type  A minimum  levels  do not  initiate  stock replenishment  action  every  time  the  stock balance  is  reduced.   In fact,  the  inventory  position  must  drop  below  one-third  of  the  minimum  level quantity  before  the  system  initiates  stock  replenishment.    In  general  terms,  the inventory  position  is  the  amount  of  base stock on hand  and/or  on  order to support requirements.    Additionally,  the  ILS-S  automatically  deletes  type  A  minim um levels  when  the  computed  demand-based  stock level  (Item  Record  Demand  Level, COLT  or  RBL  computed)  equals  or  exceeds  the  ASL  quantity.   NOTE:   Can  be used  only  with  Level  of  Approval  Flag  B--Temporary.  See  Para  2.2.15      for 100 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 minimum  level  load  instructions. identically to  type  level  flag  A  minimum 2.2.21.2.1.2.  Minimum  Level  -  Type  Level  Flag  B.    Type  B  minimum  levels function levels  with  one  important difference--the  system  initiates  stock  replenishment  when  the  inventory  position drops to one less  than  the  minimum  level  quantity.   Therefore,  before  establishing type  B  minimum  levels,  the  customer  or  materiel  management  personnel  should justify  why  the  one-third  replenish  methodology  will  not  support  operational requirements.   NOTE:    Can  be  used  only  with  Level  of  Approval  Flag  B--Temporary.  See Para  2.2.15   for  load instructions. 2.2.21.2.1.3.  Minimum  Level  - Type  Level  Flag  C.  Type  C minimum  levels  also use a one-less stock replenishment  methodology.   The distinguishing  feature  of type C minimum  levels  is  that  the  system  will  not automatically  delete  the  ASL record but  will  place  the  level  in  a Memo  status  when  the  computed  demand-based  stock level  equals  or exceeds  the  minimum  level  quantity.   Therefore,  use  type  level  C minimum levels  when  you  expect  the  computed  demand-based  stock  level  to fluctuate  above  or below  the  minimum  level  quantity.   NOTE:   Can  be used  only with  Level  of  Approval  Flag  A--Directed  or C--Permanent.   See Para  2.2.15   for load  instructions. 2.2.21.2.2.  Maximum  Levels.   Maximum  levels  (stockage  ceiling)  are used  to restrict stockage.   Examples  of  when  to  use  maximum  levels  include  projected  base  phase-downs  and  limited  storage  capacity.   Maximum-type  ASLs  will  not  begin  to  restrict stockage  until  the  computed  demand-based  stock  level  exceeds  the  maximum  level quantity.   Maximum  type  levels  are identified  in  the  ILS-S with  Type  Level  Flag  D.  NOTE:    Can  be  used  with  any  Level  of  Approval  Flag.  See  Para  2.2.10  for  load instructions 2.2.21.2.3.  Fixed  Levels.   Fixed  ASLs  maintain  a constant  quantity  of an item  to meet mission  requirements.    Therefore,  the  quantity  specified  on  a  fixed  level  may  be determined  without  regard  to any  established  demand  history.   Another  distinguis hing feature  of the fixed-type  level  is that the ILS-S treats this  level  as controlling  stock level (in  the  absence  of  COLT or RBL)  when  established  on an  individual  item  or group  of items. the  ILS-S  performs  edits  on  items  before  the establishment  of  fixed  or  other  multiple  ASLs.   The  reorder  point  for  fixed  ASLs  is normally  one  less  than  the  fixed  level  quantity.   However,  fixed  ASL  reorder  points may  be adjusted  using  a Variable  Reorder Factor (VRF).   Fixed  levels  are identified  in the  ILS-S with  Type  Level  Flag  E.    Note:  Can  be used  with  any  Level  of  Approval Flag.   See Para 2.2.10  for  load  instructions.   To  enforce  this  control, 2.2.21.2.4.  The  following  Guide  indicated  in  Table  2.24 will  be used  to  assign  Type Level  Flags. Table 2.24.  Guide  to Assigning  Type Level Flags. Rule II I III IV  If type requirement  is and automatic deletion  is and Sustainment Flag  is and the desired reorder point  is V load level then type flag AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 101 1 2 3 4 5   Minimum  (no less  than) Desired Temporary Desired Temporary Not Desired Permanent Maximum N/A N/A (no more than) Fixed (constant) N/A N/A A B C D E one third  of minimum level  or the computed reorder point, whichever  is  greater, one less  than the  minimum level  quantity one less  than maximum  level quantity  or the computed  reorder point,  whichever  is less one less  than  the fixed  level  quantity unless  VRF is assigned. Note:   Type Level  Flags  F (RBL),  G and H (Mission  Change)  are assigned  programmatically. 2.2.21.2.4.1.  Selecting  the Appropriate  Type Level  Flag. 2.2.21.2.4.1.1.  Determine  from  the level  justification  the minimum,  maximum, or fixed  level  required  (column  I).  There  is  only  one  type level  flag  in  column E applicable  to a maximum  level  (D) and one to a fixed  level  (E).  If a minim um level  is  required,  continue  to the next  step. 2.2.21.2.4.1.2.  Determine  (Column  II) whether  or not  the  detail  record can  be deleted  if  the demand  level  exceeds the total  minimum  level  quantity.   The ILS-S automatically  deletes  the  detail  record for  Type  Level  Flags  “A  and B”. 2.2.21.2.4.1.3.  Determine  (Column  III)  whether  or  not  the  detail  record  is considered  Permanent  or  Temporary.   The  ILS-S  automatically  deletes Temporary  Levels  upon  the  previously  negotiated  expiration  date.    For example,  a  Weapon  System  Modification  needing  three  years  to  complete would  have  an expiration  date three  years  from  the date of approval  and would automatically  delete  upon  reaching  expiration  date. 2.2.21.2.4.1.4.  Determine  (Column  IV)  if  the  reorder  point  must  be  one  less than  the adjusted  level  quantity  or if one third  of the minimum  level  is sufficie nt.   Note:      This  decision  affects  the  number  of  stock  requisitions  that  must  be submitted  in  order  to  maintain  adequate  stock.   If  a reorder  point  of  one  less than  the  minimum  level  is  used,  stock requisitioning  will  be on  a one-for-one basis  each  time  a non-repair  cycle  item  is  issued  or  each  time  a  repair  cycle asset  is  shipped  or condemned.   Ordinarily,  if  one-third  of  the  minimum  level quantity  satisfies  the expected  demand  during  the order and shipping  time,  then use the  one-third  reorder point. 102 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 2.2.21.2.4.1.5.  Select  (Column  V)  the  type  level  flag  as  required  by  the determinations  noted  above. 2.2.21.2.4.1.6.  Additional  Processing  Consideration  for  Maximum  Levels  - Type Level  Flag  D.  Even  though  storage  restrictions  drive  most maximum  ASL applications,  the  following  business  rules  must  be considered  before maximum ASLs are established. 2.2.21.2.4.1.7.  Interchangeable  and  Substitute  Groups.    Maximum  ASLs  are restricted  to  one  level  per  each  master  and  interchangeable  relationship  or bachelor  items.   The  system  rejects  any  attempt  to  establish  a maximum  ASL when  one already  exists  for  that  same  or group  of items. 2.2.21.2.4.1.8.  Additional  Processing  Consideration  for  Fixed  Levels  - Type Level  Flag  E. 2.2.21.2.4.1.9.  Identical  to maximum  levels,  fixed  ASLs  are also  restricted  to one  per  ISG  or  bachelor  item.    Consider  that  if  a  minimum  (no  less)  or maximum  (no more)  ASL requirement  has already  been established  in  the ILS-S for  the  item,  loading  a fixed  level  by definition  (no  more  or less)  contradicts the other  type ASLs.  Fixed  levels  are considered  the controlling  stock level  (in the  absence  of an RBL  level)  in  the ILS-S.    Corrective  action  in  this  situatio n would  encompass  deleting  the  minimum  and  maximum  ASLs,  adjusting  the fixed  level  quantity  accordingly  to  capture  support  for  all  requirements,  and reprocessing  the  fixed  level  load  input.    See  Para  2.2.15  for  establishme nt details. 2.2.21.2.5.  Variable  Reorder  Factor  (VRF).    Normally,  the  reorder  point  for  a fixed level  is  set  to one  less  than  the  fixed  level  quantity.   However,  when  a fixed  level  is established  or updated  in  the  ILS-S, an external  decision  can  be made to set a differe nt reorder point  by specifying  a variable  reorder factor  (VRF).  The VRF can be set to any decimal  factor  between  .1  and  .9  and  will  reduce  the  item  reorder  point  (ROP) accordingly.   See Figure  2.5. Figure  2.5.  VRF Example. 2.2.22.

Adjusted  Stock Level Load, Change,  Delete Transaction   (XE4).  2.2.23.1.  Purpose:    To  produce  an  output  transaction  (XE4)  for  each  firm  minim um, maximum,  and  fixed  ASL  detail  record containing  type  level  flags  A, B, C, D, or E.  The ILS-S produces  a XE4  transaction  as  a result  of  a 1F3 add, change,  or delete  transaction for  a recoverable-type  item. 2.2.23.2.  The  XE4  load  (ASL  transaction  code  L)  notification  is  sent  to  the  wholesale D035E RBL system.   If the ASL is base-initiated,  D035E will  compare the XE4 to the RBL database.  If the XE4 and the RBL database match,  an ASL confirmation  notification  (XE6) will  be returned  to the  reporting  base.  If the  XE4  and the  RBL  database  do not  match,  an ASL Reject  Notification  (XE5)  with  XE4 reject code “R”  will  be returned  to the  reporting base.  XE4 change  (ASL transaction  code C) notifications  are produced  for each firm  level whenever  the level  directed  by code, ASL quantity,  and/or validation  date is changed.   XE4 delete  (ASL Transaction  Code D)  notifications  are produced  when  firm  levels  are deleted or changed  to memo. Table 2.25.  Output  Format.

Purpose:    To  provide  instructions  and  guidelines  for  documenting  directive source  data on ILS-S ASL detail  records. 2.2.26.2.  Loading  and  Changing  Application  Source  Data.   The  application  source  data justification  for  the load  of an ASL detail  record is  entered  in  positions  44-50 of  ASL load input  transactions.  These  data are entered  in  change  inputs  if  a change  to the  data already loaded  is desired. 2.2.26.3.  Level  Directed  by Code.  The  application  source data are determined  by the level directed  by code (A – AFMC, B – Base, C – MAJCOM, D – HQ USAF). 2.2.26.3.1.  If the level  directed  by code is B (base-initiated),  enter the Technical  Order (TO),  Figure,  and  Index,  or  other  identifying  data  which  denotes  the  end  item application. 2.2.26.3.2.  If  the  level  directed  by  code is  A (HQ AFMC),  C (MAJCOM),  or D (HQ USAF), use  Table 2.28 to enter  the  application  source  data indicating  the  need for  the ASL. 110 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 Table 2.28.  Application  Source. ASL Directive Source Bench  Stock (B) Manual  (M) or Regulation  (R) Letter/email  (L) or Message  (T) ASL Load  Input  Instructions - For ASLs loaded  to support  a single  bench  stock, enter  B in  position 44 of the  ASL load  transaction. - For ASLs based on  a manual  or regulation,  enter  “M”  (if  manual) or “R”  (if  regulation)  in  position  44 of the  ASL load transaction, followed  by the manual  number  in  positions  45-50. For example,  if the  directive  source is  AFMAN 23-122, enter  “M”  in  position  44 and “23122”  in  positions  45-49. - For ASLs directed  by Letter,  enter  “L”  in  position  44 of the  ASL load  transaction;  for  ASLs directed  by a Message,  enter  “T”  in position  44 of the ASL  load transaction. - Enter  the  office  address symbol  of the  message  or letter  originator in  positions  45-50 of the  ASL load transaction  or other  applicable  data as needed.   - Enter  the  message  number  in  positions  45-50 of  the ASL load transaction  or other applicable  data as needed. 2.2.27.  Guidelines  for Assigning  the Reason Why  Code   (RWC) 2.2.27.1.  Purpose:   To provide  guidelines  for  assigning  reason  why  codes on ILS-S ASL records.   The  assignment  of  this  code is  determined  by  the  reason  or  justification  which warrants  establishment  of  the  adjusted  level.    Assign  the  code  which  most  accurately describes  the  level  requirement.    The  RWC  may  also  be  used  to  retain  weapon  system assets under  the Life  of Systems  Stock (LSS) support  concept. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 111 Table 2.29.

RBL  received  an XE4  for an item  that  is  assigned  a file maintenance  code of D, U, N, or X in  their  system. Verify  that  the adjusted  level  detail  has  been deleted from  base. Review  and  re-justify  level  (if  still  required) by changing  positions  1-3 to XE4,  position  33 to L, and position  66 to A. Verify  date to ensure  validity  of adjusted  level  detail. The  ASL should  not be firm  until  approved  from  IM. If ASL has  not been approved,  process TRIC 1F3V input with  an  asterisk  in  position  73 to blank  the approval date and change  the  ASL from  firm  to memo.  Follow-up may  be necessary  to acquire  approval  to firm  up the. If  ASL has been approved,  contact  the  approval authority  to ensure  the  ASL is  entered  in  the  RBL database. Once the IM indicates  the ASL  is loaded  to the  RBL  database, correct and re-submits  the XE4. A D043 stock list  change  that  identifies  an  item  as going  (JCD)  will  cause RBL  to delete  ASLs from  the database. When  the  ASLs are deleted,  RBL  sends  an XE5 with  an ‘S’ in  cc 67. ASLs  for these  items  should be manually  deleted  if  this  has not  automatically occurred  in  the  SBSS. No SBSS response  transactions are expected in  reply  to these  RBL  transactions. RBL  deletes  base usage  data including  ASLs.  RBL sends  XE5 transactions  with  a “U”  in  cc 67. ASLs  for these  items  should  be manually  deleted  if  this  has not automatically  occurred  in  the SBSS. No SBSS transactions  are expected  in  reply  to this  RBL transaction. RBL  sends  and XE5 with  a “V”  in  cc 67.  ASLs  for these  items  should  be manually  deleted  if  this  has not automatically  occurred  in  the SBSS. No SBSS transactions  are expected  in  reply  to this  RBL transaction RBL  returns  an XE5 with  an "X"  in  cc 67. 'X' is assigned  when  the XE4  could  not  be processed because of a file  maintenance  code of D, U, N, or X in  RBL (indicating  cataloging  data is manually  maintained  vs. from  D043). No SBSS response  transactions  are expected  in  reply  to these  RBL  transactions.  ASLs  for these  items  will  not  be accepted and should  be manually  deleted.  If Maximum  levels  of  zero are desired  then  manually  prepare and input  an XE6 (confirmation  transaction).  If other  levels  are necessary then  coordinate  with  the IM to determine  if  the  file maintenance  code can be removed  and  resubmit  the XE4. 122 Z AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 RBL  received  a DZF transaction.  RBL  deletes  any applicable  ASLs and sends an XE5 transaction  with  “Z” in  cc 67. ASLs for  these  items  should  be manually  deleted  if  this has not  automatically  occurred  in  the  SBSS. No SBSS response  transactions  are expected  in  reply  to these RBL  transactions. 2.2.32.  Stockage Priority  Codes  (SPC). items 2.2.32.1.  Purpose.    The  ILS-S  programmatically  assigns  SPCs  to  consumable (ERRCD  XB3).   The  ILS-S requirements  program  uses  SPCs to help  determine  when  the items  should  be  stocked  for  future  use.    SPCs  are  also  used  to  prevent  item  stockage (preclude  creating  a demand  level).   Additionally,  SPCs are used in  conjunction  with  SPC subgroup  codes  (see  Table  2.73)  to  help  prioritize  unfunded  requirements  via  the production  of  Funds  Requirements  Cards (FRC). 2.2.32.2.  Assigning  SPCs.  SPC codes are  categorized  into  groups:  1-5, A-E, J-N, and  / (slash),  S, T, U.  When the SPC codes are assigned  or changed,  the ILS-S programmatica l ly changes  the  101-DATE-SPC-ASSIGNED  to reflect  the  current  date.   The  ILS-S assigns SPCs  to  consumable  item  records  as  detailed  below.    Table  2.35  summarizes  the  SPC assignment  rules. Table 2.35.  SPC Assignment  Rules. UJC Code Initial  MICAP or AWP (UJC = AR) recurring  due-out   Any  reportable  MICAP or AWP AR recurring  due-out A(x)  or AWP BR recurring  due-out B(x)  recurring  due-out C(x) recurring  due-out SPC Code 0 1 2 3 4 2.2.32.2.1.  SPC 1-5.   SPC codes  1-5 may  be  changed  with  FCD  inputs.    However, these  codes are normally  assigned  to consumable  item  records as follows: 2.2.32.2.2.  SPC 1 – 4.  SPC codes 1-4 are assigned  to EOQ items  when  due-outs  are established.   The  UJC assigned  to the input  determines  which  SPC code is  assigned  to the  EOQ item  record. 2.2.32.2.3.  SPC 5.  SPC code 5 is  assigned  to new EOQ items  when  they  are loaded. 2.2.32.2.4.  ISG Items.   When  consumable  items  are I&S grouped,  the  Master  item  in the  group  is  assigned  the highest  SPC from  among  all  items  within  the  group. 2.2.32.2.5.  SPC 0.  An  SPC of  zero  (0)  is  assigned  to items  when  the  first  customer backorder  for  the  item  has  a MICAP (regardless  of  budget  code) or UJC AR  (budget code  8 only)  priority.    This  identifies  to  the  releveling  program  that  a  demand  level needs to be computed.   Once the demand  level  is  established,  the item  SPC is  changed to 1. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 123 2.2.32.3.  Updating  SPCs.  Depending  on the 101-DATE-OF-LAST-DEMAND  of an item, SPCs are programmatically  upgraded  or downgraded  as follows: 2.2.32.3.1.  SPCs 1 – 3.  SPCs 1-3 are downgraded  by  1 when  file  status  is  completed on  an  item  record,  and  there  is  no  customer  demand  over  the  previous  90 days.   For instance,  an item  with  an  SPC of  1 is  downgraded  to SPC 2 if,  after  90 days since  the 101-DATE-SPC-ASSIGNED,  no  additional  customer  demands  have  occurred  for  the item. 2.2.32.3.2.  SPC 4.  SPC 4 is downgraded  to 5 when  file  status  is  completed  on an item record, and more  than  180 days  have  passed since  the last  customer  demand. 2.2.32.3.3.  SPC 1 – 4 Without  Backorders.   For SPC 1-4, if  there  is  a demand  (but  no backorder) the  SPC remains  as currently  assigned.   If the  item  is backordered, the  SPC can  be  upgraded  depending  on  the  UJC  of  the  due  out.    Item  SPCs can  be  manually changed  via  an FCD input. 2.2.32.4.  Non-Numeric  SPCs. 2.2.32.4.1.  SPCs A  –  E.   SPC codes  A-E  are  equated  to  codes  1-5 for  programmed decisions.    Codes  A-E  must  be  assigned  by  Stock  Control  and  changed  with  FCD inputs.   SPCs A-E are not  programmatically  upgraded  or downgraded. 2.2.32.4.1.1.  SPC  E.    SPC  E  is  used  to  prevent  automatic  stock  replenishme nt requisitioning  action  for  EOQ items  which  cannot  or should  not  be stocked. 2.2.32.4.1.2.  Non NSN Items.   When  a demand  level  is  first  computed  for  a non-NSN  consumable  item,  an  SPC  E  is  automatically  assigned  by  the  releveling program.    If  local  management  wants  to  begin  stocking  the  item,  the  SPC code should  be changed  to equal  the current  value  of the  item  101-MISSION-IMPACT-CODE. 2.2.32.4.1.3.  SPC E  for  Equipment  Items.    SPC  E  can  be  manually  assigned  to equipment items  to  exclude  them  from  the  normal  automatic  due-out  release sequence.   To  remove  an  SPC  E  from  an  equipment  item,  process  an  FCD  and change  the  code to a 5. 2.2.32.4.2.  SPCs J-N.  SPC codes J-N are equated to codes 1-5 for  program  decisions.   Codes J-N must  be assigned  by Stock Control  with  FCD inputs.   When  these  codes are assigned,  MACR  restrictions  are  bypassed,  except  for  annual  orders  authorized.   MACR factoring  of requisitions  will  apply.   FRCs are not produced.  Depending  on the DOLD of  an item,  SPC codes J-N are up- or downgraded  as follows: 2.2.32.4.2.1.  SPC J – L Downgrades.   Codes J-L are downgraded  by  1 during  file status  if  an item  has not  had a demand  for 90 days. 2.2.32.4.2.2.  SPC M Downgrade.   Code M is  downgraded  to N if  an item  has  not had a demand  for  180 days. 2.2.32.4.2.3.  SPC N Upgrade.   Code N is  upgraded  to M if  the  DOLD  is  less  than 180 days, and the  current  number  of  demands  is greater  than  zero. 2.2.32.4.3.  SPC / (slash)  S, T, and  U.  SPC codes /, S, T, U are equated  to SPCs A-D for programmed  decisions.   Codes /, S, T, U must  be assigned  by and changed  by Stock 124 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 Control  with  FCD inputs.   These  SPCs are  not  upgraded  or downgraded  (as  outlined above).   When  codes /, S, T,  U are assigned,  MACR  restrictions  are bypassed,  except for annual  orders authorized.   MACR factoring  of requisitions  will  apply,  but FRCs are not produced. 2.2.32.5.  Review  of SPCs.  SPC A-E, J-N, and /, S, T, and  U identify  EOQ item  records that  must  be reviewed  quarterly.   Stock Control  must  run  a local  query  program  or an  as-required  report (AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 6) to select  and list  the EOQ item  records for review.   Stock Control  must  file  the  listing  after  it  has  been reviewed.   Keep the listing  on file  until  the next  quarterly  review  is  made. 2.2.32.6.

C-Factors. 2.2.34.1.  Purpose:   Describe  the  ILS-S logic  for assigning  C-factors. 2.2.34.2.  In  May  2002, the  Air  Force  Supply  Executive  Board approved  implementa t io n of a new C-factor assignment  policy  based on item  mission  impact,  historical  demand,  and unit  price  criteria.   The  C-factor is a multiplier  of the  standard deviation  in  the computatio n of  the  base safety  levels.   The  improved  policy  was implemented  in  the  ILS-S in  October 2002.    Bases  will  not  deviate  from  the  ILS-S  C-factor  assignment  policy  without MAJCOM/A4  and  AF/A4LM  approval.   If  an  exception  C-factor  is  approved,  follow  the procedures  in  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 5 to assign  the  exception  C-factor  in  the  ILS-S. 2.2.34.3.  C-factor  Assignment  Logic.   The  current  ILS-S logic  for  assigning  C-factors  is detailed  in  Table  2.38.  Note:   Any  item  that  does not  meet  the  criteria  in  the  table  for  a C-factor of  2 or 3 is  assigned  a default  C-factor  of 1. 2.2.34.4.  The  standard  deviation  for  an  ISG  is  the  highest  C-factor  loaded  to the  M- (master)  or  I-(interchangeable)  type  items.  For  example,  if  the  master  item  has  a C-factor  of 1 and  an interchangeable  has a C-factor  of  2, the  2 is  used to calculate  safety levels. 2.2.34.5.  A  C-factor  of  1 is  used  in  the  consumable  item  economic  range  models  to determine  whether  an  item  should  be stocked.  Once an  item  successfully  satisfies  the range  model,  the  appropriate  C-factor,  based  on  the  item  mission  impact,  unit  price, and historical  demand,  will  be used  in  demand  level  calculations. 2.2.34.6.  There is capability  within  the ILS-S to assign  a C-factor of zero (0). However, users  must  understand  that  the  assignment  of  a zero  C-factor will  result  in  no SLQ for the item.   Contact MAJCOM/A4 prior  to assigning  any C-factor of zero. If an exception C- factor  is approved, follow  the procedures in  AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 to assign the  exception  C-factor.

Base Repair Cycle Time  (BRCT). 2.2.35.1.  Purpose:   Define  and describe  the  ILS-S calculation  of the  average  BCRT. 2.2.35.2.  Discussion.   The  BRCT  is  a measure  of  the  average  number  of  days  it  takes  to successfully  repair  a recoverable  item  in  a base repair  shop.   The  BRCT  is  item  specific.   When  an  item  is  a  master  or  interchangeable  within  an  ISG,  the  BRCT  represents  the average  base repair  cycle  time  across all  grouped  items. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 129 2.2.35.3.  Calculating  Average  Repair  Cycle  Days.   Each time  a recoverable  item  is turned in  to  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity,  the  ILS-S calculates  and  stores  the  number  of days  that  the  item  was  in  the  base repair  cycle.   The  ILS-S calculation  follows:   (Date  of turn  in  – date of  issue  – awaiting  parts  (AWP) days  – maintenance  delay  days)  AWP and maintenance  delays  are  documented  via  Due  in  From  Maintenance  (DIFM)  status  codes.  Additional information  about  the  DIFM  status  codes  that  indicate  AWP  delays  and maintenance  delay  DIFM status  codes are provided  in  AFH 23-122, Vol  2, Pt 1, Ch 4. 2.2.35.4.  Repair  Cycle  Day  Calculation.   The  actual  repair  cycle  days  are  stored  on  the repair  cycle  record by the  turn-in  program.   The  average  base repair  cycle  days for  an item are calculated  by the  ILS-S during  requirements  computations.   The  average  BRCT for  an item  is  used in  ILS-S RCDL calculations.   To calculate  the average  BRCT  for an item,  the ILS-S uses data from  all  quarters  of the repair  cycle  record.  Note the number  of days used as the  repair  cycle  time  for  calculating  Repair  Cycle  Demand  Levels  (RCDL)  is  based on the  maintenance  priority  code as described  below: 2.2.35.4.1.  Maintenance  Priority  Code (MPC) 4 or 7.  When  the  maintenance  priority code is  4 or 7 (non-critical  item)  and  the average  repair  cycle  days  are greater  than  10, the  ILS-S uses  10 days.  When  the average  repair  cycle  days  are less  than  10, the  ILS-S uses the  actual  days. 2.2.35.4.2.  MPC 3, C, L,  or T.   When  the  maintenance  priority  code is  3, C, L, or T (critical  item)  and the  average  repair  cycle  days are less  than  4, the  ILS-S uses  4 days.  Otherwise,  the actual  average  repair  cycle  days  are used. 2.2.35.5.  Computing  Demand  Levels.  If  less  than  4 serviceable  TINs are used to calculate the  BRCT,  and  the  computed  average  is  less  than  4  days,  the  ILS-S  defaults  to  a  4 day BRCT  to compute  demand  levels.  Similarly,  if  the  calculated  BRCT  is  based on less  than 4 serviceable  TINs and the  average  BRCT  is  less  than  9 days, then  the ILS-S defaults  to a 9  day  BRCT  for  calculating  demand  levels.  However,  if  the  item  average  BRCT  is calculated  for  4 or more  serviceable  TINs, then  the calculated  average  BRCT is  used in  the demand  level  calculation.  Finally,  if  a computed  BRCT  for  an ERRCD  XD2 item  exceeds 6 days, the  ILS-S uses  a 6-day BRCT  to calculate  demand  levels  for  these  items. 2.2.35.6.  Exception  BRCT.  Under normal  conditions,  the exception  repair  cycle  days field on  the  repair  cycle  record  is  blank  because  the  average  number  of  repair  cycle  days  is calculated  by  the  ILS-S  during  the  requirements  computation  process.    Be  careful  when you  enter  zeros  in  this  field;  this  action  will  result  in  the  repair  cycle  quantity  portion  of the  demand  level  becoming  zero.   Take  the following  actions  to request,  load,  and  update exception  repair  cycle  days. 2.2.35.6.1.  Requesting  Exception  BRCTs.   Requests  for  BRCT exceptions  concerning groups  or categories  of items  must  be justified  and submitted  by Stock Control  through command  channels  to AF/A4LM for approval.   The Stock Control  Officer  or equivale nt is  authorized  to approve exceptions  on an individual  line  item  basis. 2.2.35.6.2.  Loading  Exception  BRCT.   When  approved,  Stock Control  will  load  the approved  exception  repair  cycle  days  on the  applicable  repair  cycle  records with  FRR inputs  prepared  as outlined  in  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 8.  Exception  repair  cycle days  normally  override  the  average  RCT and may  be loaded to the  repair  cycle  record 130 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 only  when  approved  and documented.   However,  loading  exception  repair  cycle  days on an interchangeable  or supplemental  stock record (-2) will  not affect  the requireme nts computation  process  (the  loaded  BRCT  does  not  override  the  computed  BRCT).   Exception  repair  cycle  days must  be loaded to the repair  cycle  record as follows: 2.2.35.6.2.1.  ISG  Items.    If  exception  days  apply  to  a  master/interchangeab le group,  the  exception  data must  be loaded  to the  master  repair  cycle  record. 2.2.35.6.2.2.  Supplemental  Records.    If  exception  days  are  required  on  stock numbers  that also have  a supplemental  record (-2 stock number),  the exception  data must  be loaded  to the  repair  cycle  record for  the basic  stock number. 2.2.35.6.3.  Reviewing  Exception  BRCT.    Stock  Control  personnel  must  review  all repair  cycle  records that  contain  exception  repair  cycle  days quarterly.   To review  these records,  use  the  Repair  Cycle  Data  List  (Q04)  or  a  locally  devised  query  program.   Delete  exception  BRCTs  when  they  are  no  longer  required  or  when  their  use  is  no longer  justified.   Also  delete  any  exception  BRCT  loaded  to  interchangeable  or supplemental  records.  If  applicable,  load the  exception  data to the  master/basic  repair cycle  record. 2.2.36.  Base Consumption  Data Report Format  (7SC). 2.2.36.1.  Purpose:   The Air  Force Secondary  Item  Requirements  System  (SIRS) (D200A) requires  base consumption  data to compute  quarterly  buy  and  repair  requirements  for  Air Force-managed  items.   In  the  future,  the  ILS-S will  provide  the  required  base failure  data by NSN, MAJCOM, and weapon  system  each  quarter  via  Base Consumption  Data  Report (7SC) transactions. 2.2.36.2.  7SC  transactions  are  generated  for  all  stock  numbers  with  an  F(x)(x)  routing identifier  and  an  ERRCD  of  ‘XD’  or ‘XF’  or  ‘XB’  only  if  the  quarterly  RTS,  NRTS,  or COND quantity  is non-zero.   Note the NRTS, RTS, and COND quantities  for all  items  are floored  at zero.  That  is, if  the positive  quantity  during  a quarter  is greater  than  the negative quantity,  the 7SC transaction  reports the positive  difference.   If the negative  quantity  during a quarter  is  greater  than  the  positive  quantity,  zero  is  reported.  Items  that  meet  any  of  the following  criteria  are excluded  from  the  7SC process: 2.2.36.2.1.  Stock numbers  with  ‘P’ or ‘L’ in  position  5 of  the stock number  field. 2.2.36.2.2.  Stock numbers  with  ‘ND’ in  positions  5 and 6 of  the stock number  field. 2.2.36.2.3.  Stock numbers  with  ‘X’ in  position  14 of  the stock number  field. 2.2.36.3.

Purpose:   Provide  additional  details  for determining  “base assets.” 2.2.37.2.  A  count  of  total  base  assets  is  used  as  the  basis  for  ILS-S  consumable  and recoverable  item  reorder decisions.   Total  base assets are defined  as the  sum  of: 2.2.37.2.1.  Item  record serviceable  balance. 2.2.37.2.2.  Unserviceable  XD*, XF3, and XB3 items  with  detail  organization  code 920 and unserviceable  status  code is H. 2.2.37.2.3.  Firm  DIFM balance  (DIFM status  flag  = 0, 3, 4). 2.2.37.2.4.  Supply  Point/MSK  detail  balance. 2.2.37.2.5.  Due-in  balance.    This  balance  includes  due-in  details  with  a  special requirement  flag  R,  which  determines  the  quantity  of  items  to be  requisitioned.   The total  asset field  on inquiries  includes  the  due-in  balance  with  the  special  requireme nts flag. 2.2.38.  Requirements  Computation.   To  describe the  process  and  procedures  associated  with 2.2.38.1.  Purpose: the requirements  computation.   Within  the ILS-S, requirements  computation  is the comparison of  the  inventory  position  to the  total  base need.  As  a result  of  this  comparison,  the  ILS-S may  produce due-in  cancellation  requests  (ACl),  requisitions  (A0x),  notices  (such  as funds requirement  images  (FRC)) that require  some external  action,  and release  on-hand balances to due-outs. 2.2.38.2.  Before  the  ILS-S can perform  requirements  computation,  the  inline  applicatio n programs  must  store  an  R  in  the  requirements  computation  flag  field  of  an  item  record whenever  an adjustment  in  the  assets or demand  data is  made.  (For the  ILS-S transactions (TRICs)  that  store  an  R on  the  item  record,  see  Table  2.42)  After  an  R  is  stored  on  the item  record,  the  requirements  scan  program  can  begin  requirements  computation.    The requirements  scan program  performs  requireme nts  computation  as follows: 2.2.38.2.1.  Selecting  Item  Records  for  Review.   The  requirements  scan  program  first reviews  all  item  records for an R stored in  the requirements  computation  flag  field.   The number  of  records  reviewed  is  recorded  daily  on  the  027-ITEM-ACCOUNTING-CONTROL-RECORD.    Note:    If  an  item  is  a master  or  interchangeable,  the  entire group  is  reviewed.    For  example,  if  a  master  item  requires  review,  the  ILS-S  first AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 135 consolidates  data from  all  related  interchangeable  items  in  the ISG and then  reviews  all the  records together.   If  the  item  record does not  contain  an  R, the record  is  bypassed.  If  the  item  record contains  an  R, the  ILS-S performs  requirements  computation  or file status  as follows: 2.2.38.2.1.1.  Requirements  computation  only  is  performed  if  the file  status  quarter code equals  the current  quarter  code.  This  denotes  that  file  status  has already  been accomplished  for  this  item  during  the  current  quarter.   If  the  inventory  position  is below  the  total  base need  and the  item  is  EOQ, the  item  record demand  level  may be recomputed  and adjusted.   If  so, the  date of  last  releveling  is  then  updated. 2.2.38.2.1.2.  File  status  is  performed  if  the  file  status  quarter  code does not  equal the  current  quarter  code.  This  denotes  that  file  status  has  not  been  accomplis hed for  this  item  during  the  current  quarter.   To  perform  file  status,  the  ILS-S follows the procedures  outlined  for  Type Redistributable  Category  Review  Code “A.”   The item  record  demand  level  and  the  date  of  last  releveling  are  then  updated.    For additional  information  on file  status  processing  in  the  ILS-S, see Para 2.2.41. 2.2.38.2.2.  Reviewing  Selected  Item  Records.    When  an  item  is  reviewed  under requirements  computation,  the ILS-S takes the  following  actions: 2.2.38.2.2.1.  Blanks  the item  record requirements  computation  flag  field. 2.2.38.2.2.2.  Produces stock replenishment  requisitions  or fund  requirement  inputs each time  the inventory  position  are equal  to or less than  the reorder point.   Specific procedures  for  requisitioning  can be found  in  AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5B, Order and Requisitioning. 2.2.38.2.2.3.  Due-in  cancellation  requests  are automatically  produced whenever  an item  is  reviewed  during  requirements  computation  or  file  status  and  an  excess condition  exists.   A status  detail  record is created with  status  code ZD - cancellat io n requested  by requisitioning  activity  - in  the status  field.   Other status  details  and the due-in  detail  will  not  be altered  by  the  ILS-S  until  the  source  of  supply  confir ms the  cancellation.   Due-in  excess  is  the  portion  of  the  total  assets  that  exceeds  the total  base needs.   The  system  requests  cancellation  requests  for  the quantity  above the  requisitioning  objective  plus  due-outs.   Due-ins  with  special  requirements  flag R or T are figured  into  the  requisitioning  objective  when  computing  the  requisit io n quantity;  however,  they  are not considered  as assets when  computing  due-in  excess.   Requests  for  cancellation  are  determined  and  AC1  transactions  are  produced according  to the following  rules: 2.2.38.2.2.3.1.  Requisition  cancellation  requests  will  be automatically  created and  sent  to  the  source  of  supply  for  excess  due-ins  using the  following sequence: 2.2.38.2.2.3.1.1.  Priorities  01-10 not marked  for  a due-out  are canceled  first. 2.2.38.2.2.3.1.2.  Priorities  11-15 and  99 are  then  sorted  in  descending  date sequence  (newest  first),  and cancellations  are requested  in  that  order. 2.2.38.2.2.3.2.  When  a partial  cancellation  is  requested,  the  ILS-S will  update the  existing  status  detail  (ZD)  to show  total  computed  excess.   If  no ZD  status 136 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 detail  exists,  the ILS-S will  establish  one.  Other status  details  and due-in  details will  not be altered  by the ILS-S until  the source of supply  confirms  cancellat io n.  2.2.38.2.2.3.3.  When  an excess  due-in  exists  on local  purchase  items,  the  ILS-S will  not  change  the  existing  status.   It will  create  a new  status  detail  for  the excess  quantity  only. 2.2.38.2.2.3.4.  Due-in  assets  in  excess  of  the  requisitioning  objective  are considered  for  cancellation  by the requirements  computation  process EXCEPT in  the  following  instances: 2.2.38.2.2.3.4.1.  Due-ins  contain  a special  requirements  flag  R. 2.2.38.2.2.3.4.2.  Due-ins  in  the  CONUS have  shipped  status  on  file. 2.2.38.2.2.3.4.3.  Due-ins  marked for a specific  due-out.  In this  case, the ILS-S will  request  cancellation  of  that  portion  of  the  due-in  quantity  in  excess  of the  due-out quantity. 2.2.38.2.2.3.4.4.  The  due-in  excess  is less  than  the quantity  unit  pack (QUP). 2.2.38.2.2.3.4.5.  Due-in  details  contain  a suppress  cancellation  flag  of S. 2.2.38.2.2.3.4.6.  Local  purchase  due-ins  have  a  status  detail  containing  a quantity  variance  code. 2.2.38.2.2.3.4.7.  Local  purchase  due-ins  have  a  status  detail  containing  a purchase  order number,  have  a dollar  value  of  the  cancellation  quantity  less than  $50,  have  NO  quantity  variance  code,  and  are  NOT  equipment  (FE account)  or materiel  management  (FB account)  items.   If  an item  is  a supply item,  then  the  item  record number  of demands  must  also  be one or less.   The item  record (or ISG) must  have a maximum  level  or computed  mission  change level  of zero.   The  base closure/phase-down  flag  must  be 1. 2.2.38.2.2.4.  Releases  due-outs  when  a serviceable  balance  exists.   This  is  true  in most  cases,  except  that  due-out  details  are  not  released  for  NPPC 4  items  that contain  a TEX  code period  (.), 8, X, or Z.  In  addition,  if  the  item  to be released  is in  an  I&S group  and  the  item  is  in  a lower  D043B  subgroup  (as  indicated  by  the ISG source code on the item  record), an I023 Management  Notice will  be produced.  For example,  if  the  item  requested  has  a source  code of BA  and the  available  item has  a source  code of  AA,  it  will  not  be automatically  released.   See AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for  more  information  on the  I023 Management  Notice. 2.2.38.2.2.5.  Creates  an  FEX  (forced  excess  reporting) for  unserviceab le equipment.   A redistributable  materiel  (excess)  detail  is created for reportable  items with  a source  of supply  other  than  AFMC.  If  an excess  detail  does not  exist  in  the ILS-S, one is  created. 2.2.39.  DIC/TRIC  for Requirements  Computation. 2.2.39.1.  Purpose:   Provide  the DIC/TRIC  codes which  when  processed will  store an R in the  requirement  computation  flag  field  of the  item  record. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 137 2.2.39.2.

Releveling Input  (LVL). 2.2.40.1.  Purpose:   Provide  the input  format  for the LVL transaction.   The LVL transaction generates  releveling  and/or  file  status  on the  input  stock number.   It  may  also  generate  an XCE for  RBL  items. 2.2.40.2.  Output.   The  LVL  transaction  creates  an  RBL  Inquiry  Image  (XCE)  or normal re-leveling  output. 2.2.40.3.  Input  Restrictions.

When  processed with  the  L, re-leveling  is not accomplished--only  output  of the XCE. 2.2.41.  File Status Processing. 2.2.41.1.  Purpose:    Describe  the  file  status  process  and  procedures.    File  status  is conducted  once each quarter (90 days), to review  and update the item  record demand  levels, identify  excesses,  and delete  inactive  item  records. 2.2.41.2.  File  status  must  be processed against  all  item  records  at least  once each  quarter.   File  status  on item  records  with  an alpha  budget  code or a budget  code 8 must  be initiated and  completed  during  the  first  week  of  each  new  quarter.    This  is  essential  because  file AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 139 status  writes  TTPC  4G  transaction  history  records  that  the  D28  report  uses  to  provide updated  usage  data  to  the  Readiness  Based  Leveling  system  at  AFMC.    (If  the  major command  determines that  file  status  will  be  processed  more  frequently,  Computer Operations  must  run  program  S01/NGV815; this  program  blanks  the item  record file  status quarter  code.)   Stock  Control  must  determine  the  type  of  excess  to  be processed.   Stock Control  must  also, together  with  the Computer  Operations,  carefully  schedule  the quarterly file  status  processing  so  that  the  output  does  not  create  an  excessive  workload  for  other flights  within  the ILS-S. 2.2.41.3.  It is  vital  the  RBL  has  the  most  current  usage  data to allocate  worldwide  levels.   If  usage  data used  by  RBL  is  outdated,  worldwide  levels  will  not  be optimally  allocated.   When  processed against  item  records, file  status  accomplishes  the  following: 2.2.41.3.1.  Updates  the  Demand  Level  on  Each  Item  Record.    Demand  levels  are calculated  by the ILS-S for an item  or group  of items  as follows: 2.2.41.3.1.1.  Demand  levels  are normally  recomputed  at least  quarterly  during  file status. 2.2.41.3.1.2.  Record  Demand  Level  Computation  Data.    Transaction  histories (TTPC 4G) are written  by the ILS-S each time  an item  is reviewed  by the ILS-S for a demand  level  change.   Produces an I104 management  notice  when  a demand  level is  first  established  for  part-numbered  items  when  the  source  of  supply  is  J(x)(x).   See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more  information  on the  I104 manage me nt notice.   An  I104 management  notice  will  not  be produced  unless  the  cost to stock the  item  is  greater  than  the  cost not to stock the  item.   The  cost to stock and not  to stock  can  be  obtained  from  requirements  computation  INQ.    Assigns  stockage priority  code E to all  part-numbered  items  when  a demand  level  is  first  established.   External  management  action  is  needed  to  stock  a  local  purchase  item  (source  of supply  J(x)(x)). 2.2.41.3.2.  Produce requisitions  and/or  FRCs for stock replenishment. 2.2.41.3.3.  Produces an FEX for all  excess items  assigned  excess exception  codes 1-4, 6, and  A-Z.   Produces  an  FEX  when  any  excess  item  in  an  ISG  contains  serviceable excess,  and the item  is  linked  as a substitute. 2.2.41.3.4.  Produces  an FTE for  excess  items  that  meet  the reporting  criteria 2.2.41.3.5.  Produces  a TRM  for the  following  items: 2.2.41.3.5.1.  Non-equipment  items  that  are total  excess  and not reportable.   TRMs are not produced  for equipment  items  or partial  excess EOQ/XF3 items. 2.2.41.3.5.2.  Items  with  recorded  balances  that  are  assigned  NPPC 3.  The  ILS-S enters  zeros in  the demand  data fields  if  the record balance  is  zero and the database key  of  the  next  detail  record  is  blank.   These  TRMs  contain  an  A  in  position  62; they  are  used  for  final  actions  outlined  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  7  for management  notices  034 and 036. 2.2.41.3.5.3.

Produces  due-out  release  documents  when  due-outs  exist  for  items  with  a serviceable  balance.   The  due-out  is  not  released  when  1) the  due-out  detail  contains  a TEX  code of  period  (.), 1, 8, H, U, X; or 2) the  item  is  an NPPC 4 item. 2.2.41.3.9.  Deletes  item  records  that  meet  all  of the  following  criteria: 2.2.41.3.9.1.  The  number  of  current  demands,  and the  number  of  demands  past 6 months  are both zero. 2.2.41.3.9.2.  Serviceable  balance  is zero. 2.2.41.3.9.3.  Database  key of the next  detail  record is blank  (unless  the only  detail is  LJC 0 or  Adjusted  Level  Detail  with  Type  Level  Flag  F RBL  with  quantity  of zero).   Program  control  outputs  an  XCC with  ‘99999’ in  the  quantity  field,  ‘N’ in position  ’42,’  and  ‘I’  in  position  ‘58’  when  the  deleted  item  record  had  an  RBL with  a quantity  of zero. 2.2.41.3.9.4.  Date of  last  transaction  is  greater  than  10 days. 2.2.41.3.9.5.  Repair  cycle  items  have  zeros  entered  for  all  the  data  on  the  repair cycle  record. 2.2.41.3.9.6.

When  a  demand  level  cannot  be calculated  for  an item  or a group  of items,  a 468 reject  notice  is  produced  by the  ILS-S.  For instance,  a 468 reject  notice  is  created when  an item  is  frozen  therefore  a demand  level  cannot  be computed.   One line  of the 468 reject notices  contain  an I047-I099 or I139 manage me nt notice.   The error conditions  and corrective  actions  are outlined  in  AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7. 2.2.42.  Asset Status/Excess Report Request Transaction  - DZE 2.2.42.1.  Purpose.  To assign  or update RAMPS reporting  codes in  the ILS-S or to request one-time  asset status  or excess  reports for  the wholesale  item  manager. 2.2.42.2.  Input  Restrictions.   None. 2.2.42.3.  Output.   Updated item  record, asset status,  or excess  report. 2.2.42.4.  Input  Format  and Entry  Requirements.   Screen DZE/153. 2.2.42.5.  DZE  Processing  Methods.  ICPs responsible  for item  management  prepare DZE, Asset  Status/Excess  Report  Requests,  and  forward  them  to  the  appropriate  bases  for processing.    The  different  report  codes  on  the  DZE  indicate  the  frequency  and  type  of reporting  required.    The  ILS-S  processing  of  the  Asset  Status/Excess  Report  Request (DZE)  depends upon  the  RIC of the initiating  wholesale  activity  and the  reporting  code. 2.2.42.5.1.  DZE  Processing  for  AFMC and  Contractor  ICPs.  DZEs  from  AFMC and contractor  ICPs  serve  two  purposes.   DZE  transactions  can  be used  to 1)  code stock numbers  for  periodic  asset reporting,  or 2) initiate  one-time  asset reports. 2.2.42.5.1.1.  Coding  stock  numbers  for  periodic  asset  reporting.    Air  Force  and contractor  ICP materiel  managers  use  DZE  transactions  to  assign  RAMPS  report codes  0-7  to  ILS-S  item  records  of  stock  numbers  that  require  periodic  asset status/transaction  reporting.  When  a DZE  is  received  by  a base,  the  ILS-S checks the input  reporting  code (0-7) to see if  it  is consistent  with  the  item  record ERRCD and  RIC.    When  these  codes  are  not  consistent,  the  ILS-S  produces  a  SNUD registration  (BDF  transaction)  and the  item  record  is  not  be updated.   When  these codes are compatible,  the item  record AF-RAMPS-REPORT-CODE  is updated  for all  system  designators.    If  the  item  is  in  an  ISG  as  a  master  or  interchangeab le relationship  established  by  D043B,  the  ILS-S will  also  update  every  other  master or interchangeable  stock number  in  the Interchangeable  and Substitute  Group (ISG) with  an alpha  order code.  If the  input  stock number  is in  an ISG established  by any other  process  than  D043B,  then  the  input  stock  number  will  be  changed  to  a substitute.   If  RAMPS  report  codes  5 or  7 are  assigned  and  an  inventory  has  not been completed  within  30 days, the system  will  interface  with  the special  inventor y (1GP)  program  to  request  a  special  inventory.    The  Inventory  Section  uses  the 142 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 special  inventory  output  notice  to conduct  a special  inventory  to ensure  the reported assets  will  be  accurate.    The  system  will  then  create  transaction  histories  (TTPC 4B,  4G),  if  required,  for  each  updated  stock  number.    The  system  uses  these transaction  histories  during  end-of-day  D28  processing to  produce  asset status/transaction  reports.    Future  transactions levels  of RAMPS  report-coded  item  records  will  also  result  in  new  asset  status/transac t io n reports. that  affect  inventory 2.2.42.5.1.2.  Initiating  One-Time  Asset  Status  Reports.    AF  and  contractor  ICP materiel  managers  initiate  Asset  Status/Excess  Report  Requests  (DZE)  with  report code 8 to request  updated  base asset status  reports as needed.  DZE  transactions  are forwarded  to bases for processing.   If  the input  routing  identifier  code (in  positions 67-69) is not  valid  or it  is J**, the  ILS-S will  ignore  the  request.   If  the item  record is  not  loaded  in  the  ILS-S, the  system  will  produce  a DZF (Para  2.2.43) to advise the requestor  that  the stock number  is not loaded.   If  all  edits  are passed, the system will  create  a  transaction  history  record  that  will  be  used  during  end-of-day  D28 processing  to produce asset  status  reports. 2.2.42.5.2.  DZE  Processing  for  DLA,  GSA, and Other  Service  ICPs.  DoD ICPs other than  AFMC  and  contractor  ICPs  can  use  DZE  transactions  to  obtain  one-time  asset status  reports  and one-time  excess  reports. 2.2.42.5.2.1.  One-Time  Asset  Status  Report  (code  Z).    DLA,  GSA,  and  other Service  may  request  asset  status  reports  from  Air  Force  bases  as  needed.   These requests  are  forwarded  to  all  registered  users,  via  AFMC  data  systems,  as  Asset Status/Excess  Report  Request  (DZE)  transactions  with  report  code  Z.   When  the DZE  is  processed  in  the  ILS-S a DZF,  Asset  Status  Report  (Para  2.2.43) will  be produced  and forwarded  to the requesting  activity.   If  the item  record is  not  loaded or there  are no assets to report then  a DZF is  not produced. 2.2.42.5.3.  One-Time  Excess  Report  (Code P) Requests.   When  wholesale  inventor y managers  need  to  buy  additional  inventory  they  may  first  query  retail  activities  for excess  redistributable  assets  that  may  be  used  as  a  procurement  offset.    Wholesale inventory  managers  will  request  a  report  of  the  quantity  of  redistributable  assets available  at  the  retail  level  using  DZE  with  report  P.   These  one-time  excess  report requests  are forwarded  to all  registered  users, via  AFMC data systems,  to all  registered users. 2.2.42.5.3.1.  Conditions  where  bases  do  not  respond.    If  the  requesting  routing identifier  code on the  DZE  transaction  is J**, the ILS-S will  not produce  an excess report.    Further,  if  the  item  record  is  not  loaded  for  the  one-time  excess  report request  or  there  are  no  redistributable  balances  to  report,  a  report  will  not  be produced.    Additionally,  if  the  item/group  contains  previously  reported  excess details  for which  a response  has not been received,  then  the  ILS-S will  not  produce an excess  report. 2.2.42.5.3.2.  Base  responses  to excess  report  requests.   If  all  edits  are passed and ILS-S  calculations  reveal  a  reportable  excess  condition  exists,  the  system  will produce  a Report  of Customer  Excess  (FTE)  and create  an excess  detail.   Note, an excess  report  detail  is  eliminated  when  the  quantity  reported  is  no  longer  excess AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 143 and/or  when  disposition instructions  have  been  received  from  the  appropriate agency  and shipping  action  taken.  The  format  for  the FTE  transaction  is  provided in  Para  2.2.44.  The  format  for  an Excess  report  detail  is  provided  in  this  section. The ILS-S will  report against  each system  designator  as necessary.   The  system  will consider  the  serviceable  assets  on the  item  record  for  the  input  stock number  and will  report  the  computed  excess  quantity.   Note the  ILS-S  will  only  consider  and report on the  input  stock number.   Finally,  the ILS-S will  not  report redistributab le (excess)  assets  in  an ISG that  have  a numeric  parts preference  code. Table 2.45.  DZE  Input  Format  and  Entry  Requirements.

Provide  details  about  when  and  how  base  redistributable  (excess) materiel  is  managed  by exception  in  the ILS-S. 2.2.45.2.  Excess  Exception  Codes. Excess  Exception  Codes  (EEX)  are  used  to  identify items  not  subject  to  normal  excess  reporting.  Excess  exception  codes  are loaded  to  item records using  FCD transactions  (See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2B, Stockage  Procedure). 2.2.45.3.  Prior  to EEX  codes being  used,  exception  phrase  records  must  be loaded  in  the ILS-S as outlined  in  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 8. 2.2.45.3.1.  The  exception  notice  code  (ENC)  ‘P’  on  the  exception  phrase  record denotes that  a phrase corresponding  to the exception  code must  be printed  on the output document. 2.2.45.3.2.  The  ENC  ‘R’  on  the  exception  phrase  record  denotes  the  transaction must  be rejected.  For example,  an  excess exception  code (EEX)  of 7 is  assigned  to an  item  record  and  contains  an  ENC  equal  to  ‘R.’  The  ILS-S  would  reject  any transaction  that  uses  the  EEX  7  as  part  of  input  data  in  the  system.  AFMC  will maintain  an  Exception  Control  Card  (ECC)  supporting  the  use  of  each  EEX  if required. 2.2.45.4.  Excess  Management  Actions.  AFMC  should  make  sure  EEX  code assignments  are justified  and used  only  when  necessary. Table 2.48.  EEX  Code Assignments.

DoD and  MAJCOM Equipment  Excess Procedures. 2.2.49.1.  Purpose.   Introduce  the  AFEMS Excess  Equipment  Redistribution  Program. 2.2.49.2.  AFEMS  Excess  Equipment  Redistribution  Program.    The  AFEMS  Excess Equipment  Redistribution  Program  was  developed  to  redistribute  excess  base  funded (budget  code 9/Z)  equipment  among  Air  Force installations.   This  objective  is  met through the  establishment  of  standard  excess  reporting  procedures  and by  matching  needs  against those  reported  excesses.    When  excesses  are  matched  to  needs,  AFEMS  creates  and forwards  RDOs  to  the  ILS-S.    The  ES-S  component  of  ILS-S  has  a  comprehens ive capability  that  matches  excess  equipment  assets  to  requirements  and  allows  users  (role-based) to direct  redistribution.   Air  Force Data Services  (AFDS) provides  the excess  asset and Memo due-out data through  an interface  with  ES-S.  The Asset Distribution  List  (ADL) from  Equipment  Requirements  System  (ERS)  provides  the  requirements  data.    ES-S matches  excess  assets  to  unfilled the  user  a  view  of recommended  matches  (asset linked  to requisition).   The  user  has the  option  not  to accept the  match  and  process  the  asset  to another  requisition  based on  operational  needs  at  the time.    When  the  user  makes  a  decision  to  redistribute  an  asset,  ES-S  presents  the appropriate  transaction  screens  to the  user  in  chronological  order of processing.   The  user validates  the  data  populated  in  the  screens  and  submits  the  transactions  to the  applicable SBSS accounts  for  processing.   ES-S automatically  performs  a final  check  to validate  the requisition  is  still  viable  and  asset  is  still  available  before  allowing  the  transactions  to process.    Equipment  Redistribution  Reports  are  available  and  used  to  verify the effectiveness  of  the redistribution  functionality.   See Chapter  9 of the ES-S User’s Manual for  more  information  on the  Manage  Excess  Equipment  Redistribution  capabilities. requirements  and  presents 2.2.49.3.  Scope.    All  bases  will  participate the  AFEMS  Excess  Equipme nt Redistribution  Program.   The  ILS-S  reports  equipment  shortages  (XSA)  and  serviceable equipment  excesses (XGG) daily  to the AFEMS.  See Equipment  Management  for the XSA and XGG  transaction  formats.   The  excesses  are matched  to the  shortages  by the  AFEMS and RDOs are generated  when  matches  occur. in 2.2.49.4.

See Ch 5 for the  XSI transaction  format. 2.2.49.4.3.  Base Responsibilities. 2.2.49.4.3.1.  When  the  D24  is  processed,  XGG  transactions  are  output  and automatically  forwarded  to  AFEMS.   Additionally,  FCD  transactions  are  created for  the  equipment  items,  that  when  processed  in  the  ILS-S,  will  load  an  Excess Exception  Code  (EEX)  of  “A”  to  the  equipment item  records.    The  FCD transactions  are  created  on  all  budget  code  9  and  Z  item  records  that  meet  the following  criteria: 2.2.49.4.3.1.1.  Type  account  code is  E. 2.2.49.4.3.1.2.

The  AFEMS will  provide  an excess disposition  notice  transaction  (XSI)  to the  ILS-S when  a report excess  is over  120 days old. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 153 2.2.49.5.2.  XSA  outputs  are produced  daily  for  budget  code 9 and Z  memo  due-outs. XSA outputs  require  no  external  review. 2.2.49.5.3.  Input  to  the  AFEMS  excess  equipment  program  of  all  XGG  and  XSA outputs  received  from  the  ILS-S creates  the following  input: 2.2.49.5.3.1.  The  A2*  transaction  is  sent  through  DDN  to the  shipping  base  and creates an  RDO.  See Para  2.2.53 for  the  A2* transaction  format. 2.2.49.5.3.2.  The  99S transaction  input  is  sent  through  DDN to the  receiving  base and  creates  a  due-in  detail  record  in  the  ILS-S.    See  Para  2.2.50  for  the  99S transaction  format. 2.2.49.5.3.3.  The  XSI  transaction  is  sent  through  DDN  to  the  base  reporting  an excess  for  over  120 days.   This  input  creates  an  excess  report  (FTE)  or TRM,  as applicable,  and changes  the assigned  excess  exception  code from  A to 2 preventing further  reporting  through  the  AFEMS.    Prior  to  the  actual  120th  day  and  when storage  space  is  a  problem,  a  base  may  request  FEX  input  authority  for  specific items.   During  the 120 days that  an excess  base funded  equipment  asset is  reported to AFEMS,  these  additional  actions  may  take place:   If  the  base GSD  stock  fund has not  been reimbursed  for the  asset, attempts  may  be made  to sell  the item,  even if  at  a reduced  price.    Last  resort  would  be to  free  issue  the  asset  to  a local  base requester.   If the  SMAG has been reimbursed  for  the asset,  it may  be issued  free  to a local  base requester.   See Equipment  Management  for the XSI transaction  format.  2.2.49.5.3.4.  The  AE1  transaction  is  sent  through  DDN  to  the  receiving  base  to cancel  their  due-in  detail  when  the  shipping  base has  denied  the  RDO.   See Ch 5 for  additional  information  about  AE1 transactions. 2.2.49.5.3.5.  The  AFEMS-directed  RDO  and  due-in  detail  record  serial  numbers start  daily  with  A001 and can go through  A999. 2.2.49.5.3.6.  The  BF7 transaction  is  sent  through  DDN to the  shipping  base when the  receiving  base  has  not  confirmed  or denied  an  RDO.   See  Para  2.2.55 for  the BF7 transaction  format. 2.2.49.5.3.7.  Anytime  an  equipment Shipping  or Receiving  Report (XGI)  transaction  to notify  AFEMS of the  shipment.

Reporting  L and P Stock Numbered  Items. 2.2.49.6.1.  The  AFEMS  will  provide  the  online  capability to  review  all  reported excesses,  and  to  record  and  view  descriptive  data  for  L  and  P  stock  numbered equipment  excesses.   If  a requirement  exists  at your  base for  an excess  item  at another base, in  the AFEMS  equipment  excess  program,  contact  that  base stock control  excess monitor  for lateral  support. 2.2.49.6.2.  The  LRS  CC/AO  has  the  option  to  retain  L  and  P  equipment  excesses without  reporting  to the  AFEMS  equipment  excess  program  if  a future  requirement  is expected  due to the  nature  of the  asset.  Use FEXs  that  contain  A in  position  54 output 154 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 by  file  status  as  the  indication  of  excess.    Other  means  may  also  be  used  at  local discretion. 2.2.49.6.3.  Excess  L and P stock numbered  items  will  be reported to the AFEMS using the XGG to report the excess quantity  and the AFEMS online  transaction  local  purchase description  (ILPD).   Ensure  the  identity  of  the  losing  organization,  which  will  make available  the shop name  for those specialized  items  which  are applicable  to only  one or two  organizations.    This  information  is  not  required  for  those  items  which  have  a widespread  application,  such  as office  machines  and  air conditioners. 2.2.49.6.4.  Do not report AFMC-managed  centrally  procured  L and P stock numbered items  to the  AFEMS equipment  excess  program.   Report  these  items  to the applicable IM. 2.2.50.

Redistribution  Order  (RDO) Asset Release Rules.   156 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 2.2.51.1.  Purpose.   Explain  the  rules  for  releasing  base assets  for  shipment  in  response  to wholesale  source  of supply-initiated  RDOs. 2.2.51.2.  Processing  Directly  into  SBSS.  When an A2*/A4* is  processed directly  into  the SBSS  (either  through  SIFS  or  screen  processing),  the  ILS-S  releases  serviceable  assets (identified  by  A  or  B  in  position  71)  according  to  the  A2*/A4*  input  priority.    Note:   RDO’s for  Contractor  ICP managed  items  will  be allowed  to release  down  to zero. 2.2.51.2.1.  RDOs for  MICAPs (RDD  equals  999 or N**).  All  available  assets will  be automatically  released  to zero  balance.   The  asset release  sequence  is as follows: 2.2.51.2.1.1.  Input  NSN item  record balance. 2.2.51.2.1.2.  Item  record  balance  on other  NSNs within  the  same  ISG.  One  way interchangeability  rules  are enforced. 2.2.51.2.1.3.  Supply  point  assets  with  the  input  NSN. 2.2.51.2.1.4.  Non-deployed  MSK assets  with  the  input  NSN. 2.2.51.2.1.5.  Non-deployed  RSP assets with  the input  NSN. 2.2.51.2.1.6.  If  the  total  RDO quantity  cannot  be satisfied  via  the  release  of  assets with  the  requested  NSN, then  assets  will  be  released  for  other  qualifying  NSNs within  the  ISG,  beginning  with  supply  point  assets,  followed  by  non-deployed MSK assets, and non-deployed  RSP assets.  If assets  are located  in  off-base  supply points,  or are in  deployed  status,  or are in  DIFM status,  an I136 management  notice will  be produced  and a RDO/Referral  suspense  detail  record will  be created.  See AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  7  for  additional information  about  the  I136 management  notice. 2.2.51.2.2.  RDOs  for  Non-MICAPs  (priority  01-15).    Item  record  balance  will  be automatically  released to the requisition  objective  (RO).  When the item  record balance is  equal  to  or less  than  the  RO,  the  RDO  will  be denied.  The  asset  release  sequence follows: 2.2.51.2.2.1.  Input  NSN item  record balance. 2.2.51.2.2.2.  Item  record  balance  on other  NSNs within  the  same  ISG.  One  way interchangeability  rules  are enforced. 2.2.51.2.2.3.  Supply  points  assets with  the  input  NSN. 2.2.51.2.2.4.  Non-deployed  MSK assets  with  the  input  NSN. 2.2.51.2.2.5.  If  the  total  RDO quantity  cannot  be satisfied  via  the  release  of  assets with  the  requested  NSN, then  assets  will  be  released  for  other  qualifying  NSNs within  the  ISG,  beginning  with  supply  point  assets,  followed  by  non-deployed MSK assets.  When non-MICAP  RDOs are processed, item  records will  be released beginning  with  input  stock number  and continuing  through  the ISG until  either  the RDO quantity  is  filled  or the  ISG  quantity  equals  the  RO.  If  assets  are located  in off-base  supply  points,  or  are  in  deployed  status,  or  DIFM  status  then  an  I136 management  notice  will  be produced  and  an  RDO/Referral  suspense  detail  record will  be created. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 157 2.2.51.3.  Processing  through  ES-S.  When an A2* is  passed through  ES-S (that  is, DLATS sends  the  A2*  to ES-S vs.  directly  to a specific  SBSS),  the  A2* will  be  subject  to some slightly  different  asset  availability  rules.   These  rules  are designed  to ensure  that  the  A2* is  acknowledged  (either  or  confirmed  or  denied)  as  soon  as  possible  and  to  reduce  the number  of  A2* suspended  on  RDO  suspense  details.   The  asset  availability  rules  used  in this  process are very  similar  to those used for the ES-S automatic  lateral  support (sourcing) component  (see  Chapter  12 of  the  ES-S User’s  Manual  for  more  information).    That  is, asset availability  is  based on the priority  of the  A2* as compared  to the base asset position and  automatic  accessibility  of  the  assets  (freeze  codes,  deployed  indicators,  etc.).    The Shipment  Exception  Code  does  not  apply  to  RDO  processing.    Note:      RDO’s  for Contractor  ICP managed  items  will  be passed through  ES-S to the applicable  SBSS without additional  edits. 2.2.52.  Common  RDO (A2*),  Referral  Order  (A4*),  and  Excess Disposition  Shipme nt (FTR)  Rejects and Corrective  Actions. 2.2.52.1.  Purpose.   Discuss  common  RDO/referral  order  reject  conditions  and  corrective actions.  For a complete  list  of rejects  see AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7. 2.2.52.2.  Common  RDO and  Referral  Order Rejects. 2.2.52.2.1.  224 Reject.  This  reject occurs  when  an FTR is processed and the  shipment has  already  taken  place.    If  the  shipment  has  been  previously  processed,  destroy  the input.   If  the input  document  number  is  incorrect,  correct and  re-input  the FTR. 2.2.52.2.2.  296  Reject.    This  reject  occurs  when  the  item  record  of  the  input  stock number  is  frozen.   Corrective  action  is  explained  in  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for freeze  code load  and delete  for  budget  code 8 stock numbers. 2.2.52.2.3.  307 Reject.   This  reject  occurs  when  the  reason  for  disposal  code is  blank or in  error.  Correct and reinput. 2.2.52.2.4.  321 Reject.   This  reject occurs when  the supplementary  address field  on the referral  order is  blank  or in  error.  Correct and re-input.   See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for additional  details  about  how to correct the  supplementary  address. 2.2.52.2.5.  326 Reject.  This  reject occurs when  the TEX  code is not authorized.   If the supplementary  address  field  of  the  A2*/A4*  contains  YDISPL,  the  TEX  code cannot be used in  manual  operations. 2.2.52.2.6.  329 Reject.  This  reject occurs  when  the unit  of issue  is  unequal  or in  error.  Correct  the  unit  of  issue  and/or  quantity  and  re-input.   If  necessary,  contact  Records Maintenance  for  assistance  and  the  requesting  organization  to  verify the  quantity desired. 2.2.52.2.7.  352 Reject.   This  reject occurs  when  the input  routing  identifier  or vendor code is  blank  or in  error.  Correct the  routing  identifier  code and re-input.   The  routing identifier  code  may  not  be  blank  or  contain  special  characters.    On  FT  inputs,  the shipped-to  storage  point  cannot  be  blank,  GGO,  S9(x),  SMS,  HR1,  or  contain  code S01.  When  the input  is an SHP and the TEX  code is  R, positions  4-6 of the input  must contain  a ship-to  routing  identifier  code. 158 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 2.2.52.2.8.  362 Reject.   This  reject occurs  when  a shipment  requires  special  handling.   For  A2E/A4E  shipments,  the  shipment  must  be  made  offline.   Process  the  shipment using  manual  procedures  with  TRIC SHP.  For SHP transactions,  prepare the document offline  and re-input  using  manual  procedures. 2.2.52.2.9.  369  Reject.    This  reject  occurs  when  an  A2*/A4*  is  processed  and  the shipping  destination  record is  not on file  for the  DODAAC  being  shipped  to.  To clear this  reject,  either  load  the  shipping  destination  record  and  re-input  (See AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 8 loading  instructions)  or manually  prepare  the RDO/referral  order for re-input.   When  manually  preparing  the  RDO/referral  order, provide  a valid  “ship- to” address in  positions  86-141 of  the  A2*/A4* input.   When  there  is  a ship-to  DODAAC in  the  supplementary  address  field  of  the  original  document,  use  its  address in  lieu  of the  requisition  DODAAC  address.   It’s  important  to check  for  a ship-to  DODAAC  in the  supplementary  address  field  to  ensure  the  property  is  shipped  to  the  correct destination.   The  address  provided  in  positions  86-141 will  be printed  on the  shipping document  and used  as the “ship-to”  address. 2.2.52.2.10.  392  Reject.    This  reject  occurs  when  processing  a  TRM  input  for  a serviceable  balance  when  the  item  does  not  meet  the  criteria  for  automatic  disposal action.   To reprocess  the TRM,  a transaction  exception  code must  be entered  to bypass the  criteria. 2.2.52.2.11.  444  Reject.    This  reject  occurs  when  the  system  designator/rout ing identifier  and  SRAN  cannot  be located  in  the  BASE  CONSTANTS-1 record.   Work with  the Computer  Operations  section  to ensure  that the BASE CONSTANTS-1 record is  loaded correctly. 2.2.52.2.12.  469  Reject.    This  reject  occurs  when  erroneous  status  is  processed.  Determine  the  reasons  for  the  conflict  between  the  input  and  the  recorded  status.   Correct the input  and reprocess  if  in  error.  If the  input  is  correct, as related  to recorded records,  take  action  to  verify  that  the  reject  was  not  caused  as  a  result  of  duplicate processing  of  status  inputs. 2.2.52.2.13.  520 Reject.   This  reject  occurs  when  an A2*/A4*  is  processed for a retail outlet  item  (IEX E OR K). When this  reject is received,  the BSS/IEE  must  be contacted to  determine  if  the  required  item(s)  are  available  for  shipment.    If  the  item(s)  are available,  the  A2*/A4*  must  be  reprocessed  with  a  dash  (-)  in  position  80  and  the appropriate  TEX  code in  position  73.  For an A2*/A4* (screen  #162), there  is  no place to put  the  dash,  so the  general-purpose  screen  (#051) must  be used.   However,  for  an A2*/A4*  (screen  #163), position  80 is the  last  position  of the  SRAN compare  field. 2.2.52.2.14.  528  Reject.    This  reject  occurs  when  processing  a  disposal  follow- up transaction  from  DLADS.   Document  Control  should  take actions  outlined  below. 2.2.52.2.14.1.  Reason  for  Reject.    The  AFX/AFZ  follow-up  contains  an  advice code in  positions  65-66 to indicate  the reason  for  the follow-up.  The  reason  for  the reject  can be determined  by using  the following  advice  codes: 2.2.52.2.14.1.1.  Advice  Code 35.  This  code tells  you  that  the  quantities  in  the AS3  sent  by  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  and  the  XR1  sent  by  your DLADS  did  not match  when  they  were received  by DLADS. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 159 2.2.52.2.14.1.2.  Advice  Code 36.  This  code tells  you that  DLADS received  the DLADS-generated  XR1  transaction  but  has  not  received  the  LRS/Materie l Management  Activity   The  matching shipment-suspense  detail  transportation  control  number  is  blank.   This  must  be updated with  the transportation  control  number  that the A5J was shipped  under.  -generated  AS3  status  document. 2.2.52.2.14.1.3.  Advice  Code 37.  This  is the opposite  of  advice  code 36.  This advice  code tells  you  that  the  DLADS  received  the  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity- generated  AS3 status document  but has not received  the corresponding XR1 transaction  from  your  supporting  DLADS.   This  advice  code will  create a 528 reject  from  the initial  input. 2.2.52.2.14.1.4.  If  you  receive  a  large  number  of  AFX/AFZ  follow-ups  with advice  code 37, you  should  contact  your  DLADS to determine  why  they  are not forwarding  the  required  XR1 transaction  to the  DLADS. 2.2.52.2.14.1.5.  You  will  only  receive  a 528 reject  notice  when  the  computer cannot  automatically respond  to  the  AFX/AFZ  follow- up  or  there  is  a discrepancy  in  the quantity  shipped  and the quantity  received  by the  DLADS. 2.2.52.2.14.2.  Processing  Actions: 2.2.52.2.14.2.1.  Document  Control  will  review  the  A5J  document  in  file  to determine  the  actual  quantity  received  by the  DLADS. 2.2.52.2.14.2.2.  If  the  quantity  matches  the  528 reject  quantity,  reprocess  the AFX/AFZ  input  with  a C in  position  44 and  the  actual  quantity  signed  for  on the A5J disposal  document  in positions  25-29.  This  will  cause an ASZ response to  be  automatically  produced  and  sent  to  DLADS  to  clear  the  suspense.    No further  processing  is  necessary. 2.2.52.2.14.2.3.  If  the  quantities  on  the  A5J  and  the  528 reject  do not  match, determine  if  a  special  inventory  and  reverse-post  action  have  already  been accomplished.   If  no special  inventory  action  has  been  accomplished,  forward a copy  of  the  528 reject  notice  to  the  Inventory  Section  for  special  inventor y action.   Now, reprocess  the  AFX/AFZ  reject  with  an  R in  position  44 and  the actual  quantity  which  was  received  by  the  local  DLADS  in  positions  25-29.  This  will  cause  an  ASZ  response  to  be  automatically  produced  and  sent  to DLADS  to clear  the suspense.   No further  processing  is  necessary. 2.2.52.2.14.2.4.  When  a signed  copy of the A5J disposal  document  is not in  the document  control  file,  contact  the  DLADS  and determine  if  they  have  received the  shipment/transfer.    Verify  the  quantity  DLA  DS  received  and  obtain  a signed  duplicate  copy of the document.   If the quantity  received  by DLADS  and the  quantity  shipped  by  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  match,  reprocess the  AFX/AFZ  with  a  C  in  position  44  and  the  actual  quantity  which  was received  by  the  local  DLADS  in  positions  25-29.    This  will  cause  an  ASZ response  to  be  automatically  produced  and  sent  to  DLADS  to  clear  the suspense.   No further  processing  is necessary. 2.2.52.2.14.2.5.  If  DLADS  confirms  only  a partial  receipt  or indicates  that  the 160 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 shipment  was  not  received,  make  note  of  the  facts  and  the  amount  of  quantity variance  on  the  528  reject  and  forward  the  reject  to  Inventory  for  special inventory  action.   Now, reprocess  the AFX/AFZ  reject with  an R in  position  44 and  the  actual  quantity  which  was  received  by  the  local  DLADS  in  positions 25-29.  This  will  cause an ASZ response  to be automatically  produced  and sent to DLADS  to clear  the  suspense.   No further  processing  is  necessary. 2.2.53.  Redistribution/Referral  Order  (A2*/A4*)  Input. 2.2.53.1.  Purpose.    To  provide  an  input  format  for  use  when  processing  redistribut io n orders (A2*) and referral  orders (A4*) received  from  AFMC activities  by DDN, message, or mail.

This  is  the routing  identifier  code of the base that  will  ship  the  materiel  identified  in  the A2*/A4*  transaction.   It should  equal  a routing  identifier  code on the  shipping  base’s constants  record.  When  positions  4-6 are blank,  positions  77-80 will  be edited  for  an equal  SRAN in  the  base constants  record.  If  an equal  SRAN is  located,  the  program  assigns  the  routing  identifier  code for the SRAN in  positions  4-6.  This  enables  AFMC to convert  to the  revised  format.   For redistribution  order inputs  for  items  with  IEX  E and  K, the  BSS/IEE  will  be contacted to determine  if  the  required  items  are available  for  shipment.   If  the  items  are available, reprocess the  redistribution/referral  order input  with  blanks  in  positions  77-79 and a dash (-) in  position  80.  Must  equal  001-CSB-RID or a 444 Reject  will  occur.  This reject  occurs when  the  system  designator/routing  identifier  and SRAN cannot  be located  in  the BASE  CONSTANTS-1 record. Work with  the Computer  Operations section  to ensure  that  the BASE  CONSTANTS-1 record is loaded  correctly.  See Para. 2.2.57. 2.  These  fields  may  be left  blank  on input;  however,  a media  status  code 2 will  be assigned  to position  7 by the  program.   If  the input  priority  in  positions  60-61 is blank, then  priority  13 will  be assigned  under  program  control. 3.  Supplementary  Address (positions  45-50).  Leave  positions  45-50 blank  for manually  prepared RDOs, unless  the RDO is  being  prepared to clear  a 369 reject or the item  manager  supplied  the supplementary  address by message  or phone  call.   When preparing  a manual  RDO as a result  of  a 369 reject, it  is  extremely  important  to use the supplementary  address from  the  original  input,  since  it is  used to determine  where  to ship  the property.   This  reject occurs  when  an A2*/A4*  is processed and  the shipping destination  record is  not on file  for the  DODAAC being  shipped  to. To clear  this  reject, either  load  the  shipping  destination  record and re-input  (see AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 8) for  loading  instructions)  or manually  prepare the RDO/referral  order for  re-input. 162 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 When  manually  preparing  the  RDO/referral  order, provide  a valid  “ship-to”  address  in positions  86-141 of  the A2*/A4*  input.  When  there  is a ship-to  DODAAC  in  the supplementary  address field  of the original  document,  use  its  address in  lieu  of  the requisition  DODAAC  address. It’s important  to check for  a ship-to  DODAAC in  the supplementary  address field  to ensure  the property  is shipped  to the correct  destination. The  address provided  in  positions  86-141 will  be printed  on the shipping  document  and used as the “ship-to”  address. See Para.  2.2.57. 4.  Document  Identifier  Code (positions  1-3) and Signal  Code (position  51).  Redistribution  orders A2E and A25 and referral  orders A4E and A45 must  be processed using  manual  procedures,  except  those  directing  transfer  to DLADS.   See Para.  2.2.52. information  about  362 rejects.   This  reject  occurs  when  a shipment requires  special  handling.  For A2E/A4E  shipments,  the  shipment  must  be made offline. Process the shipment  using  manual  procedures  with  TRIC SHP. For SHP transactions, prepare the  document  offline  and reinput  using  manual  procedures.  When  the supplementary  address contains  YDISPL,  prepare a TRM input  (see  AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for  input  format). 5.  Distribution  Code (positions  54-56).  A two (2) in  position  54 of  the A4* input image  identifies  reimbursable  redistributions.   A three  (3) in  position  54 of the  A4* input  image  identifies  Lateral  Reparable  TAV.   A blank  in  position  54 of the  input  A4* input  image  identifies  AFMC directed  RDO.  Positions  55 and 56 contain  the  system designator. 6.  Condition  codes, can be A, B or F. 7.  TEX/Denial  Code (position  73).  This  code applies  when  an RDO is  reinput  to deny the  RDO (using  denial  codes D, E, F, G, W, or X), to ship  off  of a specific  detail  or substitute  stock number,  to reinput  the A2x/A4x  to decrease  and/or delete  the RDO suspense  detail  (220) (TEX  *); to let  the ILS-S determine  where  to ship  the asset  from (TEX  R) or for manual  operations  (TEX  6).  See Para.  2.2.52. for  a definition  of these codes.  TEX  code 6 only  applies  to priority  designator  01-03 MICAP RDOs. a.  If  positions  4-6 are blank  and position  73 contains  an alpha  character,  manual operations  will  not apply. b.  For manual  operations,  position  73 must  contain  TEX  code 6, positions  4-6 contain the  base RIC, positions  77-80 are left  blank  (to avoid  a 326 REJ),  and the A2*/A4*  is reinput. 8.  This  field  is to be used to provide  the address for  a shipment  when  the  shipping destination  record is  not loaded  (clears  a 369 reject).   See Para.  2.2.58.  When  clearing a 369 reject,  if  there  is  a “ship-to”  DODAAC in  the supplementary  address field,  be sure  and use the  address that  corresponds  to it;  otherwise,  use the  shipping  address that corresponds  to the requisition  DODAAC as normal.   This  is  extremely  important  since it  determines  where  the  property  is  shipped  to.  The  address provided  in  positions  86-AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 163 141 will  be printed  on the  shipping  document  and used  as the  “ship-to”  address.  If  the Shipping  Destination  Record is  loaded this  input  will  not  override  it. 9.  This  field  is to provide  additional  shipping  instructions  as needed. 10.  This  field  will  contain  the MSK, Supply  Point,  or RSP detail  document  if  the asset is  being  shipped  directly  from  the  supply  point,  MSK, or RSP detail. 11.  If  this  is a reinput  from  an RDO/Referral  suspense  detail  (220 detail),  then  do the following: a.  If  shipping  from  detail,  use the NSN from  the detail. b.  If  shipping  from  substitute,  use  substitute  NSN. 12.  If  this  is a reinput  from  an RDO/Referral  suspense  detail  (220 detail),  then  use the quantity  from  the supply  point/MSK  detail,  or substitute  NSNs. 13.  If  this  is a reinput  from  an RDO/Referral  suspense  detail  (220 detail),  then  use the suffix  code on the 220 detail  record. 14.  Routing  Identifier  Code (positions  74-76).  When  processing  this  transaction inline,  input  the  RID of  the base that  directed  the  movement  of materiel  identified  in the  A2*/A4* transaction.  2.2.54.

Explain  how  the  ILS-S  responds  to  ICP  RDO  follow-up  (BF7) transactions  and  referral  order follow- up  (AF*) transactions. 2.2.57.1.1.  Responses  to  RDO Follow-up  Transactions.   The  ILS-S response  to ICP-initiated  BF7  transactions  depends  upon  the  status  of  the  RDO  when  the  wholesale follow-up  transaction  is  received.   See Para  2.2.55 for  the  BF7 format. 2.2.57.1.1.1.  RDO/referral  orders with  Shipment  Suspense  Records.  If a shipment suspense  detail  is  on file  with  transportation  data, the ILS-S outputs  a BL7 follow-up reply  transaction.   The  BL7 transaction  provides  the  RDO shipping  status  to the ICP.  See Para  2.2.56 for the  BL7 transaction  format.   Alternatively,  if  a shipment suspense  detail  is  on  file  in  the  ILS-S  without  transportation  data,  the  system produces an I147 management  notice  indicating  the shipment  requires  research, and sends  an  AE6  status  transaction  (with  status  code  BD)  to  the  ICP.  See AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  7  for  details  on  the  I147  management  notice  and  how  to research  the  shipment.   Supply  Requirements  Section  personnel  will  try  to locate the  released  asset  and  initiate  the  appropriate  actions  depending  on  the  results  of their  search. 168 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 2.2.57.1.1.2.  Asset  Not  Located  or  Not Shipped.    If  the  shipped  asset  cannot  be located  or if  shipment  action  cannot  be completed,  Requirements  Section  personnel prepare  a shipment  denial  (B7*)  status  input  by  hand  (according  to  Para  2.2.54) and begin  action  to reconcile  the asset balance,  e.g., special  inventory,  reverse-post, etc. 2.2.57.1.1.3.  RDO/referral  order Suspense  Detail  Exists.   If no  shipment  suspense detail  is  on  file,  the  ILS-S will  search  for  an  RDO/Referral  suspense  Detail.   If  an RDO/Referral  suspense  Detail  exists,  the  system  produces  an  I147  Management Notice  and  a  one  (1)  is  stored  in  position  5  of  the  220-Filler-1  field  on  the RDO/Referral  Suspense  Detail.    The  I147  Management  Notice  provides  the  220 detail  record  number.    Requirements  Section  personnel  should  take  action  to expeditiously  resolve  the suspended  condition,  i.e., actually  complete  the  shipment or  deny  the  RDO  as  soon  as  possible.    If  any  subsequent  BF7  follow-ups  are received  for  the  same  RDO, position  5 of  the  Filler  1 field  will  be incremented  by one. 2.2.57.1.1.4.  No  Record  of  the  RDO.    If  no  shipment  suspense  detail  or RDO/Referral  suspense  detail  exists  in  the,  the  system  will  reformat  the  RDO follow-up  request  (BF7) and process the BF7 as an A2* transaction,  effectively  re-establishing  the  original  RDO. 2.2.57.1.2.  Responses  to referral  order follow-up  Transactions.   The  ILS-S response  to ICP-initiated  referral  order follow-up  (AF*) transactions  depends upon the status  of the referral  order when  the wholesale  follow-up  transaction  is  received.   When  the referral order follow-up  is received,  the ILS-S searches for a Shipped  Not Credited (SNC) detail (for  distribution  code 2 Referrals)  or a Shipment  Suspense  detail  (for  distribution  code 3 Referrals).   If neither  an SNC nor a Shipment  Suspense  detail  exists,  the system  looks for  an RDO/Referral  Order Suspense  detail. 2.2.57.1.2.1.  Shipment  Suspense or Shipped  Not Credited Detail  Exists.   If an SNC or Shipment  Suspense  detail  exists,  and  the  detail  does  not  reflect  shipment  data, then  the  ILS-S produces  and transmits  an  AE*  transaction  with  status  code “BA.”   If  an SNC or Shipment  Suspense  detail  exists  with  shipment  data, then  the  system produces  and  transmits  an  AS* transaction  to communicate  the  shipment  status  to the  ICP. 2.2.57.1.2.2.  RDO/referral  order  suspense  detail  exists.   If  an  RDO/referral  order suspense  detail  exists,  the system  produces  an I147 Management  Notice with  a one (1) in  position  5 of  the  220-Filler-1  field  on  the  220 RDO/referral  order  Suspense detail.   The  I147 Management  Notice will  list  the 220 detail  record.  Stock Control personnel  should  take action  to expeditiously  resolve  the  suspended  condition,  i.e., honor  or deny  the  referral  order as soon as possible.   If  any  subsequent  follow - ups are received,  then  position  5 of the 220-FILLER-1  field  will  be incremented  by one.  2.2.57.1.2.3.

Routing  Identifier  Code (positions  4-6). Leave  the  RIC field  blank  unless  the  shipment  is lateral  support to other Air  Force bases.  In those  cases, positions  4-6 will  contain  the applicable  D** RIC of the  Receiving  base of the  property and equates  to  the  RIC of  the DODAAC in  the supplementary  address. a.  If  shipment  is  to an  activity  other  than  an Air  Force base, and the  item  is serviceable a Redistribution/Referral Order (A2/A4) must be received/processed.  JLS is no longer a valid RIC for lateral support  shipments. Also unserviceable  property  can still be processed with TRIC SHP. b.If shipment is done manually, enter JBW c.If the TEX code is R, enter RIC. 2. If this is a shipment  from a detail, enter the following data: a.  Ship-to routing identifier code in positions 4-6. b.  Supply condition code A in position 44. c.  Ship-to SRAN in positions 45-50 d.Fourteen  digit document  number  in positions 67-80. 3. Document Number  (positions 30-43) and Supplementary  Address (positions 45- 50). The document  number  and supplementary  address must be entered when shipment is done manually or when the consignee provides a document  number  for lateral or equipment shipments. a. b. If positions 30-43 contain a document  number,  positions 45-50 must contain the  ship-to SRAN If positions 30-43 are blank on input, the MILSTRIP document  number  will be  program assigned using the ship-from SRAN, current  date, and next available serial  number 4. Supply Condition Code (position 44).  Any authorized  SCC may be used.  However, when the input is for shipment from a DIFM unserviceable detail record,  the SCC must be equal to the MCC on the detail (otherwise a 260 reject may occur).  The SCC is usually Q for Deficiency Report shipments. 5. Supplementary  Address (positions 45-50). If this field is blank, the program will select the ship-to SRAN from the shipping override record or from the shipping destination record if RIMCS data are available. If the ship-to SRAN cannot be determined, the input will be rejected. The SRAN/DODAAC must be valid and not one of the following ZZZZZZ or "PSEUDO CAGE CODE 6ZE66" , 999999, FB0000, or FE0000 or you will receive a 303 reject. a. If  shipment  is  to non-DoD  government  agency,  enter  the applicable FEDSTRIP  code (DLM 4000.25, Vol  6, Logistics Systems Interoperability Support Services). b. If shipment is a return  of vendor-owned  assets, enter EYO and the numeric vendor  code c.

For unserviceable  shipments,  enter  the  Julian  date and serial  number  from  the unserviceable  detail  document  number  in  positions  73-80. The  ILS-S assigns  activity  code R, organization  code 920, and shop code RW to complete  the unserviceable  detail  document  number. 14. Transaction  Identification  Code (positions  1-3). An  unserviceable  shipment (SHP) will  create an FTA output  shipping  document  when  the  repair  cycle  record contains  project  code 3AL and RIMCS code A. (For signal  and fund  code assignment  of FTA  documents,  see notes  7 and 9 above.)  Project code 3AL identifies  automatic  return  of an unserviceable  (supply  condition  code E or F) NIMSC 5 item  for  which  a replacement  will  be requisitioned. 15. TRIC TIN/SHP  Controlled  Item  Code (position  81). Use this  code when AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 173 shipping  unclassified  property  which  has classified  data but  cannot  be removed  for mechanical  reasons.

Shipment  Exception  Code (SEX)  Management. 2.2.60.1.  Purpose.  To  list  and  explain  shipment  exception  (SEX)  codes,  shipment modifier,  and  shipment  override  records  used  in  the  ILS-S  to  suppress  automatic shipments.  This  attachment  also  details the  effects  of  processing  exception  coded shipments  in  the  ILS-S. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 177 2.2.60.2.  SEX  Assignment  Criteria.  SEX  codes  are  one-digit,  alpha/numeric  codes assigned  to  items  to  either  restrict  shipment  or  modify  output  shipment  transactions. AFMC is responsible  for the management  and assignment  of each SEX code, to include maintaining  an  exception  control  (ECC) image  (as required)  for  each item. 2.2.60.2.1.  Preclude  Automatic  Shipment.  SEX  codes 1, 2, 3, 4, and  7 will  cause  the ILS-S to preclude  automatic  shipment. 2.2.60.2.2.  External  Review  Required.  SEX  codes are also  used  to identify  shipme nts that  require  external  management  review  before  shipment  action  is  taken. 2.2.60.3.  Exception  Phrase  Record  (EPR).  The  basis  for  all  exception  code management  is  the  EPR.  The  EPR  supporting  shipment  exception  codes  is  used  to justify  and  explain the  reason  for  assigned  shipment  exceptions.  When  normal shipment  procedures  do not satisfy  local,  MAJCOM, or source  of supply  requireme nts, AFMC  may  use  a  combination  of  exception  (SEX)  codes,  shipment  modifiers,  and shipment  overrides  to restrict  or modify  out-bound  base shipments.  See AFH  23-123, Vol  2,  Pt 2,  Ch  8 for  more  information  concerning  exception  phrase  record  creation and management 2.2.60.4.  Exception  Notice  Code (ENC).  The  exception  notice  code (ENC)  is  contained on each EPR  in  the  ILS-S. The  ENC is  used to augment  individual  SEX  codes and is  used to  either  stop  (ENC  R)  or  allow  (ENC P)  shipment  processing  under  special  conditions. ENC R will  “reject”  any  attempt  to automatically  ship  the item.  ENC P will  “process”  and produce  a notice  of shipment.  See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for  more  information. 2.2.60.5.  SEX  Codes.  See  Table  2.61  for  a  list  of  SEX  codes,  associated  exception phrases,  and ECC management  requirements  for each  SEX code. Table 2.61.  List and  Description  of SEX Codes.

SEX Code Updates.  AFMC will  load and  change  SEX codes (Stock Control Data Change  transaction)  when  contacted  and only  if  the  changes  are required  to meet mission  needs. When  SEX codes no longer  apply,  delete  the SEX with  a Stock Control Data Change  transaction. 2.2.60.7.  Effects  of  SEX  Code Assignment.  Shipment  exception  codes assigned  to  items in  the ILS-S may  or may  not effect  outbound  shipment  processing.  The  effect  of item  SEX codes may  be altered  when  combined  with  the  transaction  identification  code (TRIC)  and ENC. See Table 2.62 below  for  specific  processing  effects. Table 2.62.

Special  mission  needs  occasionally  require  some modification  of  normal  shipment  processing.  Therefore,  modifier  options  were developed for  use to manage  special  shipment  requirements. 2.2.60.8.1.  Precautions  for Use. There  are potential  problems  inherit  in using  shipment modifier  options.  Before  selecting  any  shipment  modifier  option,  gain  a  thorough understanding  of all  six  options  and their  use. 2.2.60.8.2.  Shipment  Modifier  Load Options. AFMC personnel  may  load shipment modifier  records to modify  internal  processing  and output  shipment  (DD 1348-1A) documents.  A  SEX  code must  be loaded  to the  item  record  for  which  a shipment modifier  record has been created. Once the shipment  modifier  record is established with  the modified  data elements,  the data fields  on the modifier  record will  overlay 180 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 normal  input  and/or  output  data. See  AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch  8 for  loading, changing  and deleting  shipment  modifier  records. 2.2.60.9.  Shipment  Override  Options.  Shipment  override  record  data  elements override  normal  shipment  data elements  when  processing  automatic  shipments,  except for RIW items.  When  shipment  override  records are used, the ship-to-SRAN, mark-for, priority  designator,  and project code data elements  in  the shipment  override  record take precedence  over  the  respective  data  elements  contained  on  the  ILS-S  repair  cycle record. Three  options  have  been created to exercise  the  shipment  override  flag  field  on the  shipment  modifier  record.  Note:  AFMC  personnel  will  control  all  changes, additions,  and deletions  to shipment  override  records. 2.2.60.9.1.  Option  1  –  Support  Center  Pacific  (SCP).  The  SCP  option  is  used  to designate  a base operating  or participating  under  SCP procedures.  When  this  option  is used, turn-in  transactions  with  maintenance  action  taken code (MATC)  1 through  7 or D  will  be changed  by  the  ILS-S to  MATC  code  D.  The  item  will  be shipped  to  the override  ship-to-SRAN  data element  specified. 2.2.60.9.2.  Option  2 - Suppress  DD 1348-1A Output  Document.  This  option  applies  to input  shipment  and replies  to reports  of excess  transactions.  To use this  option,  ensure no other  supported satellite  SRAN uses the shipment  exception  code you have  selected. The  ILS-S outputs  three  copies  of  the DD 1348-1A when  this  option  is used. 2.2.60.9.2.1.  Exclusions  for Use. Do not use shipment  override  option  2 if  property is to move  through  Transportation  channels.  Transportation  movement  requires  six copies  of the DD 1348-1A. Only  three copies  of the  DD 1348-1A will  be produced if  shipment  override  option  2 is  used. However,  if  this  option  is  used  in  error, you will  need to create the additional  copies  manually. 2.2.60.9.3.  Option  3  - Suppress  Shipment  Suspense  Detail  Record  and  SSC  Output Image.  The  ILS-S  will  not  create  a shipment  suspense  detail  record  or corresponding shipment  suspense  output  (SSC) image  when  shipment  override  option  3 is  used. Use option  3 only  for  shipment  transactions.  This  option  is normally  used when  property  is shipped  to a collocated  account,  or when  Transportation  channels  are not  used to move property.  Option  3 can  also  be used  to suppress  shipment  suspense  detail  record  and SSC output  image  creation  when  transporting  a mission  support  kit  (MSK), mobilit y readiness  spares  package  (MRSP),  or  a  war  reserve  materiel  (WRM)  kit  to  its destination.    Note: Obtain  one-time  requests  for  kit movement  by telephone.  The  ILS-S disregards  this  option  if  reimbursement  is required  and a shipped  not  credited  (SNC) detail  record  is  created.  Make  certain  no  other  satellite  SRAN  located  on  the  ILS-S computer  uses  the  SEX code you  have  selected. Section 2C—Financial Management 2.3.  Financial  Management. 2.3.1.

The  primary  objective  is  to achieve  the approved  ratio  by the close  of the  fiscal  year.  At most  activities  the ratio  tends  to be high  at the beginning  of each fiscal  year and gradually  decreases as the year progresses.   Historically,  this  is because Due-Out  commitments  carried  over  from  the  prior  fiscal  year  become  Stock  Fund obligations  early  on  causing  a  "bow  wave"  in  the  ratio  which  gradually  diminishes.    It should  be  noted  that  all  elements  in  the  computation  of  the  ratio  are  cumulative  and therefore  variations  in  the  ratio  become  less  pronounced  as the  cumulative  values  increase during  the course  of the  year. 2.3.2.2.  Increase  Sales  and  Lower  Ratio.   Issues/sales  to  customers  (ISU/MSI)  increase sales  and lower  the ratio. 182 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 2.3.2.3.  Decrease  Obligations  and  Lower  Ratio.    The  following obligations  and lower  the ratio: transactions  decrease 2.3.2.3.1.  Discounts  earned  on purchases  resulting  from  prompt  payment  of  invoices. 2.3.2.3.2.  RNB detail  deletions  (1DR)  with  blank  TEX  code. 2.3.2.3.3.  Trade in  allowance  on purchases  of materiel  toward similar  materiel. 2.3.2.4.  Increase  Total  Obligations  and  Increase  Ratio.    The  following increase  total  obligations  and increase  the ratio: transactions 2.3.2.4.1.  Stock replenishment  requisitions  to normal  sources  of supply. 2.3.2.4.2.  Requisitions  for  initial  spares  (for  example,  MCD  changes,  Readiness Spares  Packages  (RSP)  for  new  modified  weapon  systems)  stockage  policy  changes and increases  in  WRM requirements. 2.3.2.4.3.  Forced bill  payment  on a receipt  when  no RNB exists. 2.3.2.4.4.  Repair  expenses  of  SMAG  assets  (for  example,  Air  Force-owned containers). 2.3.2.4.5.  Expenses  incurred  from  termination  of a contract. 2.3.2.4.6.  Transportation  expenses  paid  to a local  purchase  vendor. 2.3.2.4.7.  Postponement  of  requisitions  that  support  obligated  due-outs  (TEX  7, Z)  to the  next  fiscal  year.    This  increases  the  ratio  at  the  beginning  of  the  following  year when  the requisitions  are submitted  (creates an obligation  in  the following  year without a demand). 2.3.2.4.8.  Increases  to  stockage  levels  eventually  impact  the  ratio  whenever  stock requisitions  are produced.  The following  are examples  of increases  to stockage levels : 2.3.2.4.8.1.  Base/AFMC  initiated  adjusted  levels  (for  example, support  of bench  stock authorizations  - directed  by code D). levels in 2.3.2.4.8.2.  Forced demand  data input  (FCL) to increase  demands. 2.3.2.4.8.3.  Issues  processed as recurring  instead  of nonrecurring. 2.3.2.4.8.4.  Due-out  cancellations  with  TEX  9  (recurring  demands  are  not decreased). 2.3.2.4.8.5.  Invalid  use of priorities  on issue  requests (for  example,  UJC AZ results in  stockage  priority  code 2 and will  cause a demand  level  faster  than  UJC CZ). 2.3.2.5.  Decrease Sales and Increase Ratio.   Credit turn-ins  (TIN) will  decrease gross sales.  2.3.2.6.  Individual  Transactions  That  Impact  Ratio.    The  following  transactions  taken individually  impact  the ratio  as depicted  below: 2.3.2.6.1.  Local  purchase  requisitions,  status  and adjustments: 2.3.2.6.1.1.  A requisition  has no impact  until  a LPS is  processed. 2.3.2.6.1.2.  Processing  an  LPS increases  obligations  and increases  the ratio. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 183 2.3.2.6.1.3.  Processing  an LPA  to increase/decrease  the  dollar  value  of the  due- in will  likewise  affect  the ratio. 2.3.2.6.2.  Due  in  cancellations: 2.3.2.6.2.1.  AE1/AE9  on depot and TRIC LCC on local  purchase  requisitions  (with firm  status)  decrease obligations  and the ratio. 2.3.2.6.2.2.  Cancellation  of  a  local  purchase  due-ins  without  LPS  on  file  has  no impact. 2.3.2.6.3.  Shipments  of excess  transportation  expenses  for excess  materiel  returned  to depots increase  obligations  and the  ratio. 2.3.2.6.4.  Receipts  (REC): 2.3.2.6.4.1.  Receipt  not  due-in obligations. transactions increase the  ratio  by  increasing 2.3.2.6.4.2.  Items  received  free  (MILSTRIP  status  BN) decrease  obligations  and the  ratio. 2.3.2.6.4.3.  Receipts  of requisitions  with  Signal  code D have  no impact. 2.3.2.6.5.  Requisitions   for  lateral  support: 2.3.2.6.5.1.  If  the  requisition  supports  the  customer  due-out,  the  ratio  decreases because  there  is a sale  with  no obligation. 2.3.2.6.5.2.  If  the  requisition  is  for  stock  (for  example,  mission  change  details), there  is  no impact  because  there  will  be no billing. 2.3.2.7.  Transactions  That  Have  No Impact  on Ratio.   The  following  transactions  have  no impact  on the ratio: 2.3.2.7.1.  Nonreimbursable  (free)  issues. 2.3.2.7.2.  Ordering  customer  due-outs  from  DLADS. 2.3.2.7.3.  Equipment  unfunded  due-outs  (TEX  8, H, or D). 2.3.2.7.4.  RSP transfers  (1KT). 2.3.2.7.5.  Noncredit  turn-ins  (TIN). 2.3.2.8.

Funds  manager-prepared  1LM is assigned  control  number  9999. 2.  The  following  information  applies: Figure  2.12.  TTPC  Information. 2.3.4.  Example  of MACR Factor  Development.  2.3.4.1.  Example  of  MACR  Procedure.   To  determine  factors  to  use  in  the  MACR,  you must  first  compute  the value  of requisitions  you  anticipate  making  for the remainder  of the fiscal  year.   Then  compare  this  value  to the  value  of  TFA  that  has  not  been  processed  as requisitions.    If  the  value  of  anticipated  requisitions  is  greater  than  the  value  of  TFA,  a deficit  exists  and MACR factors  are in  order.  The  above matrices  in  paragraph  above  will be used in  the following  example  of the MACR development  process.  These  hypothet ica l figures  will  be used  as a basis: 2.3.4.1.1.  Total  projected requirement                2,000 million 2.3.4.1.2.  Total  Financial  Authority  (TFA)         1,875 million 2.3.4.1.3.  Deficit                                                   125 thousand           Note:   Remember that  the  figure  for  total  projected  requirement  and  TFA  represents  projections  for  the remainder  of the  fiscal  year. 2.3.4.2.  Items  Normally  Not Suppressed.  No suppression  of ordering  should  be applied  to items  that  are highly  essential  for  missions  or that  have  high  sales  potential. 2.3.4.2.1.  Mission  essential  items.    SPC  1  identifies  MICAP  items;  SPC  code  2 identifies  urgency  of  need  code  A  items.    SPC 1  and  2  items  in  all  subgroups  will therefore  normally  be  requisitioned  at  100  percent.   To  signify  100  percent requisitioning  of  these  items,  enter  a blank  (b)  (as above)  in  matrix  positions  A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, and D2. 2.3.4.2.2.  Sales  potential  items.   Normally  items  having  high  sales  potential  will  also be requisitioned  at 100 percent.   These  items  are usually  bench  stock and Base Service Store  items.   (Recall  that  A  is  bench  stock,  B  is  individual  equipment,  C represents Base Service  Store and tool  issue  items,  and D is other  items.)   To eliminate  high  sales AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 187 potential  items  from  consideration  temporarily,  enter  blanks  in  matrix  positions  A3, A4, C3, and C4. 2.3.4.3.  Subgroup  B Item  Chosen  to Reduce  Deficit.   To continue  the  example  situatio n, suppose an AF policy  decision  is  made to reduce some  individual  equipment  requireme nts (subgroup  B).   Funds  managers  entered  blanks  in  B1  and  B2  to withhold  suppression  of critical  materiel,  but B3 and B4 were not  affected  by those  designations.   Note in  Matrix  1 (Table  2.65.) that  the  total  projected  expenditures  in  B3 were  10,000, and  in  B4, 20,000.  Assuming  a 10-percent reduction  in  those two areas, we can formulate  Table 2.65.  (Notice that  the  figure  of  a  10-percent  reduction  is  adjusted  upward  when  the  percent  factor  is factored  in.   See note  below.) Table 2.65.  Example    MACR Requisition  Objective--Buy. Matrix Pos. Percent Factor Value of 10-percent Reduction B3 B4 50 40 1000(x5) 2000(x6) Net Value 5,000 12,000 Note:   When  computing  the  actual  MACR factor,  subtract  the  first  number  of  the percent  factor  from  10 (the reduction  of 10 percent).   The  first  number  in  10 is 1.  For example,  if  the  percent-reduction  factor  number  is  10, subtract  (10-1 = 9) and 9 becomes  the  number  used  in  computing  the net  values  of reductions.   If the percent  factor  number  is  40 (as in  B4 above), subtract  4 from  10 to get 6, and use 6 to compute  net reduction  value.   Enter  percent  factors  of 50 (B3) and 40 (B4)  in Table 2.65.  The  net  value  of  these  two reductions  is  only  $17,000, leaving  a $108,000 deficit  (from  the  original  $125,000 deficit)  to contend  with. 2.3.4.4.  SPC Subgroup  D Items  Chosen  to Reduce  Deficit  Further.   The  least  essential  of the  category  of  items  is  SPC subgroup  D.  A significant  reduction  may  be possible  in  this area.  Enter  50 in  position  D2, 10 in  position  D3, and 10 in  position  D4 of  Table 2.66. Table 2.66.  Second Example   MACR Requisition  Objective --Buy. Matrix Position Percent Factor D2 D3 D4 50 10 10 Value of 10-percent  Net Reduction  Value 3,000(x5)   15,000 5,000(x9)   45,000 1,500(x9)   13,500 2.3.4.4.1.  A  net  decrease  of  $90,500  ($17,000  from  Table  2.65  plus  $73,500  from Table 2.66) has now  been realized,  and to this  point,  no significant  impact  on missio n capability  or  customer  support  has  been  made.    But  with  $34,500  (of  the  origina l $125,000 deficit)  yet  to be reduced, the  only  alternative  is  to apply  cuts  in  some  of  the high-dollar  areas. 2.3.4.5.  High-Demand  Items  Chosen  To  Reduce  Deficit  Further.    Before  using  high-demand  items  to reduce  the  deficit,  here  are a few  points  to keep in  mind.   The  use  of  the factor  does not eliminate  the  requirement.   It only  delays  the  requisition  process.   Even  if 188 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 a zero  factor  is  used,  the  program  will  always  compute  a minimum  requisition  quantity  of the  OS&T  and  safety  level  quantity  plus  one.    Thus  the  MACR  technique,  if  applied carefully  and without  FRC inputs,  will  make  backorders  less  likely  to occur.   Remember that  backorders  that  occur  on  items  that  have  a specified  level  of  stockage  will  cause  the quantity  you  are  required  to maintain  to go  up.   Another  point  to remember  is  that  when MACR adjustments  are being  made,  the computer  is responding  to two sets of instructio ns, making  it  possible  to  stock  excess  materiel.    To  spread  the  remaining  deficit  evenly throughout  the  high-demand  area, use  the  following  factors  and enter  50 in  C3 and  C4 of Table  2.67.   At  this  point,  the  full  $125,000 deficit  ($17,000  from  Table  2.65, $73,500 from  Table 2.66., and $35,000 from  Table 2.67.) has been  eliminated. Table 2.67.  Example   MACR Requisition  Objective--No  Buy. Matrix Position Percent Factor C3 C4 50 50 Value Of 10-Percent  Net Reduction  Value 4000(x5)   20,000 3000(x5)   15,000 2.3.4.6.  Results.   A net decrease in  requirements  of $125,000 has been made, resolving  the deficit  problem.   At  this  point,  an FRC input  decision  must  be made  and the actual  factors computed.    Recall  that  a  policy  change  brought  about  the  reduction  in  subgroup  B, individual  equipment.   Presumably,  then,  FRCs will  be desired  for  B3 and B4 (but  not  B1 and B2, which  are priority  items).   Now go back to the Table  of MACR factors  Table 2.68.  The  new  matrix  will  be as follows,  with  the  letters  in  place  in  B3  and B4 indicating  FRC processing  and  the appropriate  percent  factors. Table 2.68.  Example     Table of MACR Factors.  1 2 3 4 A Blank Blank Blank Blank B Blank Blank E D C D Blank  Blank Blank 5 5 5 1 1 2.3.4.7.  At this  point,  load  the  MACR  factors  on the  MACR record using  a MACR  load, change,  or delete  input  (TRIC  1LM). 2.3.4.8.  Delayed  Effect  of  Adjustments.   Do  not  look  for  immediate  results  when  these factors  are applied.   The  MACR factor  adjusts  the  requisitioning  quantity  at the same  time that  a requirement  to  requisition  is  generated.   Usually  it  will  be 90 days  minimum  (one file  status  quarter)  before  any  impact  will  be noticed.   For this  reason,  once the  factors  are loaded,  they  should  not  be changed  for  one  full  quarter  unless  a change  is  essential.   Of course,  this  time  lag  factor  has  no bearing  on the decision  of whether  or not to use FRCs. 2.3.5.  Materiel Acquisition  Control  Record Adjustment  - Input  (MAC). 2.3.5.1.  Purpose.

MACR  factors  provide  a  short  term,  orderly  means  to  stabilize programs.    Need for MACR Factors.  As a rule,  MACR factors  are necessary  any time  that a deficit  can be anticipated.   Deficits  can occur  when  the  value  of  anticipated  requisit io ns is  greater  than  the  value  of  TFA.  Command  and  local  changes  in  requirements  can  make adjustments  necessary. 2.3.7.2.  Stockage Requirements  Adjustments.   Stock requirements  are based on stock fund stratification  data.   No adjustments  in  this  data  are  made  except  in  operating  levels  and numerical  stockage  objective  requirements.   Operating  level  requirements  are adjusted  to compensate  for  the lag  between  demands  and obligations  dictated  by the  reorder point.   At times,  adjustments  in  the  form  of  increases  or  decreases  in  stockage  levels  can  also  be directed  by  division  managers  or others  at a local  level.   These  changes,  if  approved,  are reflected  in  the  operating  program.    They  will  be  taken  into  account  when  TFA  and requirements  are compared. 2.3.7.2.1.  Formula.   The  sum  of  the  due-out  and  the  factored  EOQ plus  the  order and shipping  time  (O&ST)  plus  the  safety  level  quantities  (SLQ)  minus  the  sum  of  assets on  hand  (AOH)  and  due-in  (DI)  equals  the  adjusted  requisition  quantity  (ARQ).  EXAMPLE:    (DO  + FEOQ) +  OST +  SLQ - (AOH  + DI)  = ARQ.         Note:   The factored  EOQ equals  the  EOQ times  the  factor  percentage  plus  .999. 2.3.7.2.2.  Table  of  MACR  factors.    In  the  following  table  of  MACR  factors,  the percent  of  the  EOQ quantity  to  be requisitioned  is  given.   The  factors  also  provide  a way  of indicating  when  funds  requisition  inputs  (FRCs) should  be produced. Table 2.72.  MACR Factors. Requisition  Percent  of EOQ Quantity     100     90     80     70     60     50     40 FRCs No. Produced  Yes Blank + (12 zone) 9 8 7 6 5 4 I H G F E D AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 193     30     20     10     0 3 2 1 0 C B A ? Note: A 7 means  70 percent  of requirement  is placed  on order either  by requisition  or FRC image.   The  other  30 percent  is  ignored  as a requirement  by the  computer  and will  be included  in  the  next requirements  computation. 2.3.7.2.3.  MACR factor  by SPC subgroup.   To accommodate  a MACR factor  by SPC subgroup  within  SPC, a 16-character  matrix  (4  SPC sub-groups  across  times  4  SPC codes down)  must  be provided  in  the  MACR.   Each  of  the  16 positions  in  the  matrix controls  an individual  subgroup  as follows: Table 2.73.  SPC Subgroups. SPC CODE    1    2    3    4 A 1A 2A 3A 4A Subgroup B 1B 2B 3B 4B C 1C 2C 3C 4C D 1D 2D 3D 4D Note: SPC subgroup  A is  bench  stock, B is  individual  equipment,  C is  Base Service  Store and tool  issue  items,  and D is  all  items  not falling  in  subgroups  A, B, or C. 2.3.7.2.4.  Example  of  MACR  matrix  table.    Table  2.74  is  an  example  of  how  the matrix  in  a MACR could  be loaded. Table 2.74.  Example  of MACR Matrix Table. Subgroup SPC CODE A    1    2    3    4    9 B  + H E C    7 D  + E  Note: The  1LM input  for the  above MACR factor  is shown  below.   (See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M for  additional  information.) 2.3.7.2.5.  Table  2.74  shows  how  the  matrix,  when  loaded  as above,  establishes  the EOQ and  FRC directives  as follows.   Either  a number,  letter,  or blank  will  appear  in the  subgroup  matrix.   If a number  appears, it  indicates  the  percentage  (9 = 90 percent) of EOQ that  should  be ordered. 2.3.7.2.5.1.  A number  indicates  the percentage  and that  no FRC images  should  be 194 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 produced. 2.3.7.2.5.2.  A letter  indicates  the  percentage  of EOQ to order (A = 10 percent;  H = 80 percent)  and  that  FRC inputs  should  be produced. 2.3.7.2.5.3.  A  blank  indicates  100  percent  of  the  EOQ should  be ordered  and  no FRC inputs  should  be produced. 2.3.7.2.5.4.  A plus  indicates  100 percent  of  the  EOQ should  be  ordered and  FRC inputs  should  be produced. 2.3.7.2.6.  Illustrative  examples.    The  following  list  demonstrates  how  the  example matrix  is  to be interpreted.   Refer  first  to the  example  matrix  (Table  2.74) and then  to the  MACR (Table 2.72) to understand  the  interpretations: 2.3.7.2.6.1.  For SPC 1, all  subgroups,  compute  and  requisition  100 percent  of  the EOQ and do not produce  FRC inputs. 2.3.7.2.6.2.  For SPC 2, subgroups  A and  C, compute  and  requisition  100 percent of the  EOQ and do not produce  FRC inputs. 2.3.7.2.6.3.  For SPC 2, subgroups  B and  D, compute  100 percent  of the  EOQ and produce  FRC inputs. 2.3.7.2.6.4.  For SPC 3, subgroups  A and  C, compute  and  requisition  100 percent of the  EOQ and do not produce  FRC inputs. 2.3.7.2.6.5.  For SPC 3, subgroup  B, compute  80 percent  of  the  EOQ and  produce FRC inputs. 2.3.7.2.6.6.  For SPC 3, subgroup  D, compute  50 percent  of the  EOQ and  produce FRC inputs. 2.3.7.2.6.7.  For  SPC  4,  subgroup  A,  compute  and  requisition  90  percent  of  the EOQ and do not produce  FRC inputs. 2.3.7.2.6.8.  For SPC 4, subgroup  B, compute  50 percent  of  the  EOQ and  produce FRC inputs. 2.3.7.2.6.9.  For  SPC 4,  subgroup  C,  compute  and  requisition  70  percent  of  the EOQ and do not produce  FRC inputs. 2.3.7.2.6.10.  For SPC 4, subgroup  D, requisition  0 percent of the EOQ and produce FRC inputs. 2.3.7.3.  Effects  of  FRCs.  After  the  MACR factor  has  been  used  to adjust  the  requisit io n quantity,  an FRC input  is produced if  necessary.   Note:   See below for a word of precaution on the  use of FRCs in  MACR factors. 2.3.7.3.1.  If  no  FRC  is  necessary  and  the  extended  dollar  value  of  the  requisition  is equal  to or less  than  the  maximum  obligation  for  stock replenishment,  a requisitio n  is prepared.    However,  if  the  extended  dollar  value is  greater  than  the  maximum obligation,  an FRC is produced even  though  not requested  in  MACR factors  due to the maximum  obligation  flag.   This  system  is  useful  as a way  of seeing  that  managers  do AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 195 not  overstock  and  exceed  the  stockage  objectives.    It  also  serves  as  a  caution  to managers  to reconsider  requisitions  in  this  circumstance. 2.3.7.3.2.  UND.  A UND is a part of the  MACR control  system.   The  urgency  of need operates  in  conjunction  with  other  MACR  controls  discussed  above.  The  MACR  has an urgency  of need funding  flag,  either  A (highest  priority),  B, C, or E (lowest  priority).   When  a request  is  processed,  there  is  an  urgency  of  need  automatically  factored  into the  request.   For instance,  if  the  MACR  flag  is  B and  the  issue  request  is  B or A, and the  extended  dollar  value  of the  requisition  is  equal  to or less  than  the  value  loaded  to the MACR for due-out requisition,  the computer  will  requisition  the item.   If the request is C, or the extended  dollar  value  is greater  than  the value  loaded to the MACR for due-out requisitions,  the  computer  will  not  requisition  but will  produce  an FRC. 2.3.7.3.3.  Deficit  Exists.    Once  it  is  found  that  a  deficit  exists  (value  of  anticipated acquisitions  exceeds  authorized  TFA),  the  stock  fund  manager  and  Stock  Control personnel  must  make  two decisions: 2.3.7.3.3.1.  Decrease  of  requisitions. to  decrease, questions  about  the  comparatively  essential  nature  of  the  SPC of  different  items must  be considered.   This  decision  must  in  turn  be influenced  by questions  of sales potential  and the  limits  of the  budget.   In  deciding  which items 2.3.7.3.3.2.  Disadvantage  of  FRCs.    Before  deciding  whether  or  not  to  produce FRCs to  help  in  planning  requisitions,  managers  should  realize  the  disadvanta ges of using  FRCs.  The  MACR factor  system  itself  provides  an automated  and highly selective  way of slowing  down orders.  FRCs will  delay  orders further  and increase the potential  for backorders.  Remember  that  the time  lag  between  FRC production and actual  requisitioning  (administrative  lead-time)  is  not considered  when  O&ST is  computed.    Consequently,  for  every  day  an  FRC  is  held,  a  day  of  stock  and pipeline issue  and/or  computation  of  projected requirements.   Therefore,  while  FRCs can be helpful,  as a rule,  they  should  be used only  when  there  are changes  in  requisition  objectives  made  at a command  level  or when  circumstances  make  future  forecasting  of  needs extremely  uncertain. is  lost,  thus  delaying time 2.3.7.4.  Analytical  Tools  for  Development  of MACR  Factors. 2.3.7.4.1.  R45  Report.    The  MACR  Factor  Analysis  Report  (R45/NGV862)  is  the primary  tool  to use  in  developing  MACR factors.   It provides  for  asset stratification  by SPC and  SPC subgroup.   The  Stock  Fund  Stratification  Program  (M20/NGV827)  is also  useful  in  determining  the adjustment  amount. 2.3.7.4.2.  Three  Matrices.   In addition  to the stratification,  three matrices  are provided: 2.3.7.4.2.1.  Matrix  1—Table  2.75. (Actual  RO).  In this  matrix,  the  values  of  the EOQ  segment  of  the  computed  requisitioning  objective  are  listed.    As  in  the previous  matrix,  16 elements  of  data (4 SPC codes and 4 subgroups)  are provided.   All  values  appear in  whole  dollars.   The  following  is  an example: Table 2.75.  Actual  Requisition  Objective.

Matrix  2--Table 2.76 (MACR  RO-BUY).  This  matrix  lists  the values of  matrix  1 after  suppression  (a percent  of  the  total  value).   For example,  in  SPC 1A, the  original  amount  in  matrix  1 was 10,000.  Ninety  percent  of  that  amount  is the  value  after  a suppression  of 10 percent.   Hence,  SPC 1A appears as 9,000(90).  In matrix  2, the suppression  values  are 10 percent for  SPC 1, 20%  for  SPC 2, 30% for  SPC 3, and 50% for SPC 4. Table 2.76.

Matrix  3--Table 2.77 (MACR  RO-NO BUY).    Matrix  3 is  a kind  of model  that  you  can  use  in  working  out  an  approach  to  requisitioning  problems through  use  of  the  MACR  factors.    The  symbol  (b)  means  blank  and  implies  no change  (that is,  you continue  to order 100 % of the stock objective).   A (b) followed by  a  number  "percent  factor"  designates  an  area  that  should  not  be  changed  if possible,  but  that  can be subject  to lowering  of requisitioned  quantities.   A number standing  alone  designates  an  area  of  relatively  low  priority  where  initial  cuts  in requisition  quantities  can be made. Table 2.77.

To  assist  you  in  your  decision-making  process  when  placing  MACR controls  on an account.   The  following  information  is  from  a study  (Stock Fund  Analys is, LS890212) conducted  by the AFLMA  in  June  1989. 2.3.8.1.1.  There  is no right  or wrong  MACR factor.  Each SMAG manager  has to apply MACR factors  based on the  health  of their  Operating  Program  and the mission  of their base. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 197 2.3.8.1.2.  MACR factors  will  reduce  the total  dollar  value  of  requisitions  for  an SBSS account  and will  consequently  reduce on-hand  inventory.   The amount  of the reduction is  proportional  to the  severity  of the MACR  alternatives. 2.3.8.1.3.  MACR factors  will  only  work to resolve  short-term  (6 to 8 months)  SMAG problems  and  cannot  be  used  from  one  fiscal  year  to  the  next,  unless  net  customer demands  decline.   If customer  demands  are on a decreasing  trend line,  MACR factoring is  an  excellent tool  to  proactively  control  the  outlay  of  SMAG  dollars  and  the subsequent  reduction  in  inventory. 2.3.8.1.4.  Application  of  the  MACR  factor  will  reduce  customer  support  (backorders increase)  and  generate  additional  workload  for  both  retail  (receipt  processing)  and wholesale  (requisition  processing  and shipping)  systems. 2.3.8.1.5.  Holding  FRC  at  base  level  for  a  secondary  review  will  reduce  customer support  and increase  workload  without  any  real  savings. 2.3.8.1.6.  MACR  factoring  options  should  be  used  to  control  the  SMAG  when customer  demands  are on the  decline  or to correct  short-term  deviations  in  the  SMAG operating  program.   However,  MACR  factoring  is  not  recommended  as  a long- term solution ratio imbalances. to  correct  year-to-year  SMAG  demands to  operating  obligations 2.3.9.  GSD Pricing  and Surcharges. is  charged  an  additional  cost  for  GSD 2.3.9.1.  Purpose.  The  base  supply  customer requirements  procured  from  DLA,  GSA  or  other  services.  The  surcharge  is  added at  the retail  level  to  all  General  Support  Division  items  and  may  be  positive  or  negative.  The latest  surcharge  applied  annually  during  the  end of year  conversion  steps. 2.3.9.1.1.  Each  item  in  the  GSD  SMAG  has  a standard  price.  This  price  is  used  for both  sales  and  financial  data  on  inventory  transactions  and  balances.  The  standard prices  include  the  following  elements. 2.3.9.1.2.  Unit  Product  Cost. The  unit  product  cost covers  1) the  contract  costs of  the item  which  includes  the  cost of  Gov't  furnished  property  on a total  or amortized  basis, and 2) the initial  preservation  and  packaging  costs  if  they  were  not provided  for  in  the Base  Contracting  or  assembly  contract.  The  unit  product  cost  does  not  include  price discounts  for  prompt  payments.  When  vendors  offer  special  discount  prices,  they should  use the  discounted  price  as the  line  item  price. 2.3.9.1.3.  GSD surcharges  contained  in  the base constant  records are added to the total transaction  cost  plus  taxes,  when  applicable  for  local  purchase  items,  and  to  the standard  price  for  items.    The  surcharges  are  used  to  cover  transportation  costs  and estimated  costs  of  losses  due  to  such  factors  as  pilferage,  damage,  obsolescence, deterioration,  inventory  shortages,  etc.  and  ensure  an  equitable  distribution  of  GSD costs across the  GSD customer  base. 2.3.9.1.4.  All  nonlocal  purchase  GSD  items  will  be assessed the  additional  surcharge at time  of issue  or backorder. 2.3.9.1.5.  Credit  for  turn-ins  of  GSD  items  will  be  at  the  item  record  unit  price regardless  of the  Air  Force surcharge. 198 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 Section 2D—War Readiness Materiel (WRM) 2.4.

This  will  only  apply  when  the  action  code equals  R.  This  field  will  reflect  the  actual  quantity  that was transferred  for  this  stock number  and document  number.  When  processed, this  quantity  will  be picked  up as the  detail  on-hand  quantity. 33. Enter  the Moving  Average  Cost (extended  cost). Figure  2.14.  (DELETED)   .  2.4.3.  MSK/MRSP/WRM Transfers  Between Kits (1KT). 2.4.3.1.  The  1KT  input  can  fill  the  requirements  of  a  specific  detail  from  any  of  seven different  MSK/MRSP/WRM  detail  records  or  it  can  transfer  a  specified  quantity  to  and from  detail  records.  Prime  detail  records can also be deleted.   When required,  the computer AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 205 can  load  or delete  substitute  detail  records  automatically.   NOTE:   1KT inputs  cannot  be reverse-posted  and require  inputs  to correct  any  processing  errors. 2.4.3.2.  Input  Preparation. 2.4.3.2.1.  Leave  the  action  quantity  blank  when  the requirements  of the  gaining  detail document  number  are  to  be filled  from  assets  recorded  on  MSK/MRSP/WRM  detail records  specified  by  the  input  stock  number,  system  designator,  and  parameters.   The total  quantity  transferred  will  be a combination  of  the following. 2.4.3.2.1.1.  The  gaining  primes 2.4.3.2.1.2.  The  authorized  quantity  minus  on-hand  assets (including  substitutes) 2.4.3.2.1.3.  The  due-outs  (except  when  due-out  action  flag  M is  used) 2.4.3.2.1.4.  When  processing  serialized  reporting  assets,  you  must  process  TRIC DSR  or  XHB  prior  to  transfer.   Serialized  reporting  assets  cannot  be  transferred using  the 1KT multiple  option. 2.4.3.2.2.  Transfer  the  resulting  quantity  from  those  assets  recorded  on  the  detail record  as  specified  by  the  first  parameter  of  the  input.    When  the  deficiency  is  not satisfied  by the detail  record of the first  parameter,  check the detail  record of the second parameter. 2.4.3.2.3.  Continue  checking  each  parameter  until  all  have  been  verified  or  the deficiency  has been satisfied. 2.4.3.2.4.  When  the  asset  position  of  the  gaining  detail  record  does  not  match  the authorized  quantity,  an F206 management  notice  will  be produced. 2.4.3.2.5.  When  an action  quantity  is  entered,  the  computer  will  transfer  this  quantity to and  from  the detail  record specified  by the  input. 2.4.3.2.5.1.  Rejects  occur  when  the  gaining  detail  record  asset  position  and  the action  quantity  exceed the  authorized  quantity. 2.4.3.2.5.2.

Note:   The suspension  of  inbound  BLAMES  and ES-S incoming  transaction  processing impacts  the  host  and all  associated satellites  so close coordination  is  required.  Satellites experiencing  problems  forcing  them  into  degraded operations  (including  exercises)  should notify  Host accounts  as soon as possible. 2.5.3.  Base Level Data Required  to Support  Degraded Operations. 2.5.3.1.  The  table  below  portrays  the  typical  data needed to support  degraded  operations.   The  LRS CC/AO or equivalent  may  add or delete  products  they  deem necessary  to support degraded  operations  in  their  organization. 2.5.3.2.  The  AFSCDB/NGV301M  is  the  primary  source  for  ES-S record data.  However, if  the AFSCDB is  unavailable  for more  than  48 hours  then  consider  processing  NGV301M anyway  to  stage  the  required  data  for  degraded  operations.    If  neither  of  these  options (AFSCDB  or  NGV301M  output)  is  feasible  then  legacy  reports  (either  those  listed  or equivalent)  must  be processed.  The CTC will  ensure  the data required  to support  degraded operations  is  updated/downloaded  at least  as frequently  as indicated  and  readily  available when  degraded operations  are initiated.

The  sequence  of  document  identifier  codes  (DIC)  and  transaction  identifica t io n codes  (TRIC)  is  not  all-inclusive.    Local  discretion  should  be  used  to  consider  local conditions  and processing  restrictions. 2.5.5.3.  If  a  formal  declaration  of  degraded  operations  is  not  made  and  CT  is  not established, the  recovery  will  be  accomplished  in  TRIC/Date/Time  sequence,  that  is, process  the  transactions  in  the  sequence  they  were  created.    When  recovering  deployed transactions,  process the  transactions  in  the sequence  they  were created.  The  Item  Record Loads  will  be sorted  as a group  and  the  rest  of  the  transactions  will  be processed  as they would  have  on the  mainframe,  if  one had been available  during  the  deployed  operation.

Unnecessary  use  of drawings/MILS specifications  normally  results  in  higher  prices  which  may  not be justifiable in  view  of mission  requirements.   Therefore,  detailed  drawings/blueprints  or MIL standard  specifications  should  not  be used if  commercial  off-the-shelf products  are acceptable  and they  cost less. b.  Price.   Include  the unit  price,  if  known,  and an allowable  tolerance.   This data will  be used by Base Contracting  personnel  to ensure  that  items  with unacceptably  high  prices  are not used.  If  the  price  is not  known,  enter  an estimated  unit  price.   Determine  whether  the  customer's  price  estimates  are reasonable  by comparing  them  to those  for  similar  items  already  loaded  in the  account  or listed  in  ML's.  This  will  ensure  that  proper ERRCD  and budget  code, as well  as the  proper price,  is  assigned. c.  Bench/mockup  set.

Receipt Acknowledgement  and  Follow-Up. 3.3.1.1.  Purpose.   To  describe  the  processes  and  transactions  used  by  the  retail  materiel management  process to acknowledge  receipt  processing  and to respond to follow-ups  from wholesale  activities. 3.3.1.2.  Two  Processes.    The  ILS-S  acknowledges  receipts  with  wholesale  activit ies through  two distinct  methods.   These  methods  are the  Materiel  Receipt  Acknowledge me nt (MRA)  process and the  Receipt  Acknowledgement  for RAMPS-reportable  items  process. 298 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 3.3.1.3.  Materiel  Receipt  Acknowledgement  (MRA)  Process.  The  MRA  process  applies to all  base materiel  receipts  (excluding  local  purchase,  local  manufacture,  lateral  support, and receipts  with  serial  numbers  9900-9999) regardless  of the  wholesale  source of  supply.   The  process  uses  three  transactions:    The  Materiel  Receipt  Acknowledgement  Notice (DRA);  the  Follow-up  to Delinquent  Materiel  Receipt  Acknowledgement  (DRF);  and  the Materiel  Receipt  Acknowledgement  Reply  to  Follow-up  (DRB).   These  transactions  are explained  below. 3.3.1.3.1.  Materiel  Receipt  Acknowledgement  Notice  (DRA).   The  DRA  transaction is  generated  by  the ILS-S whenever  a materiel  receipt  (REC)  transaction  is  processed.  The  DRA  notifies  the  source  of  supply  when  a shipment  from  a wholesale  source  of supply  is received.   DRAs are not produced for local  purchase  (JBB), local  manufac t ure (JBD),  lateral  support (JLS/Dxx),  and receipts  containing  serial  numbers  9900 through 9999. 3.3.1.3.1.1.  Input.

Follow-up  to Delinquent  Materiel  Receipt  Acknowledgement  (DRF).   If  a Materiel  Receipt  Acknowledgment is  not  received  within  a specified  time,  the  source  of supply  sends  the base a follow-up  to Delinquent  Materiel Receipt  Acknowledgement  (DRF)  transaction.

When  a DRF transaction  is processed in  the ILS-S and the due-in  detail  record is found with  a  document  number  matching  that  of  the  DRF  input,  the  system  produces  a Materiel  Receipt  Acknowledgement  Reply  to Follow-up  (DRB)  transaction  to provide receipt  status  to  the  source  of  supply.

Receipt  Acknowledgment for  Recoverable  Assembly  Management  Process System  (RAMPS)-reportable  Items.  The process used by the ILS-S to acknowledge  receipt of RAMPS-reportable  items  is very  similar  to the MRA process.  However,  these processes differ  in  two  ways.   First,  while  the  MRA  process  applies  to  all  items  receipts  (with  the exceptions  noted earlier),  the  Receipt  Acknowledgment  for RAMPS-reportable  items  only applies  to  AF  and  C-ICP managed  items  reportable  through  the  D28/NGV868  RAMPS report  (see  AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch  5).  The  transactions  used  to implement  receipt acknowledgment  for  RAMPS-reportable  items  are produced  in  batch  as  part  of  the  D28 report rather  than  at the time  of receipt. 3.3.1.4.1.  Reporting  Transactions.    When  bases  receive  reportable  items,  the  ILS-S produces and sends D6x (Materiel  Receipt,  other than  Procurement  Instrument  Source) or  D4S  (Materiel  Receipt,  Procurement  Instrument  Source)  transactions  to  the  AF source  of supply.   The  D6* and D4S transaction  formats  are provided  in  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 5. 3.3.1.4.2.  Materiel  Receipt  Follow-up  (DXB)  transaction.   If  the source of supply  does not  receive  a Materiel  Receipt  transaction  (D6*) within  a specified  time,  the  source  of supply  sends the  base a Materiel  Receipt  Follow-up  (DXB)  transaction. 3.3.1.4.2.1.

Reply  to Materiel  Receipt  Follow-up  (7K6).  The ILS-S responds to Materiel Receipt  Follow-up  (DXB)  transactions  with  Reply  to  Materiel  Receipt  Follow- up (7K6)  transactions.    If  the  requisition  is  still  due-in  at a  base, the  system  produces  a 7K6 transaction  reflecting  the quantity  still  due-in.   If  the due-in  detail  record does not exist  in  the  ILS-S, the  system  produces  a 7K6 report  with  zeros  in  the  due-in  quantity field.

The  status  codes in  Table  4.1 are used to track items  in  the repair  cycle. 4.3.1.2.1.  DIFM  status/location  codes will  reflect  the  status/location  of  the  asset  due in  from  maintenance,  not  the issued  asset. 4.3.1.2.2.  AXC.  FSC will  contact  maintenance  activity  to determine  expected  aircraft return  date and  will  follow  up  when  date  is  overdue  with  maintenance  on  the  day  the aircraft  is  expected  to return. 4.3.1.2.3.  AWF  may  be  used  only  for  parts  being  held  by  AMUs  will  be  used  by AMUs,  not  repair  shops,  for  assets  that  are  awaiting  confirmation  of  serviceabilit y (system  operations  checks)  from  flightline  maintenance. 4.3.1.2.4.  Z date  status  code will  be used  instead  of  AWM, CTE,  FWP, INW, MTM, RPR.  Blank  is not  authorized  and will  be changed  immediately. 4.3.1.2.5.  CTR  may  only  be  used  by  Air  Force  Repair  Enhancement  Program (AFREP).   All  other  assets under  contract  repair  will  use  Z date status  codes. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 307 4.3.1.2.6.  IID,  INO, INR, and  IRD  status  codes will  be determined  by  LRS  Materiel Management.   FSC will  track  estimated  arrival  date  and  TCN will  be documented  if applicable. 4.3.1.2.7.  INV.  DIFM  assets  whose  location  can’t  be  “eyes  on”  validated  by  the owning  organization  within  24  hours  of  receiving  the  serviceable  asset  are  deemed missing  and  will  be  identified  by  status  INV.   The  DIFM  detail  will  immediately  be frozen  for  special  inventory  and DIFM inventory  count  conducted  IAW 23-122.” 4.3.1.2.7.1.  FSC will  ensure  INV status  is  loaded  to the  DIFM  detail  prior  to  the detail  being  frozen  for special  inventory.   If  applicable,  FSC will  validate  and track report of survey  (if  applicable)  by documenting  adding  the report of survey  control number  to positions  45-50 of the DIFM detail  until  the  discrepancy  is  closed. 4.3.1.2.8.  OAM. OAM status  will  be used until  asset is  removed  from  weapon  system or  end  item.    Parts  are  due  in  from  maintenance  the  moment  they  are  backordered, provided  the  asset  does not  limit  or restrict  the  operational  capability  of  the  weapon system  or  end  item.   D23  monitor  will  request  estimated  removal  date  for  parts  that can’t  be removed  until  the new  part is  received  and OAM status  exceeds  3 issued  days.  4.3.1.2.9.  TCG.  The  FSC  will  validate  scheduled  maintenance  dates  for  all  parts  in TCG status  and will  notify  applicable  activity  when  backorder and issue  times  are non-compliant  with  AFI 21-101. 4.3.1.2.10.  TIN.  Assets  coded  TIN  with  a  status  indicator  other  than  CRT  will  be reconciled  daily  by FSC to ensure  assets  are processed. 4.3.1.2.11.  TOC. FSC will  validate  all  NSNs in  TOC status  against  the  T.O. and  will document  the  T.O. number. 4.3.1.2.12.  Z(NN) Repair  shops  will  use Z dates.  Z dates are used to reflect  projected release  of  DIFM  assets  from  repair  shop  (e.g.  Z65).   The  last  two  positions  of  the  Z date status  code represents  the  last  two digits  of the  Julian  date assets will  be returne d to supply. 4.3.1.2.13.  Parts with  location  FSC will  not have  a status  other  than  (TIN, RFS, MDR, and INV) and will  be reconciled  daily  to ensure  assets are processed and accounted  for.  4.3.1.2.14.  Standard  DIFM  status  codes listed  in  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 1, Table  4.1, are  not  authorized  for  use  as  location  codes (i.e.  TCG,  TOC,  AXC,  etc.)  and  will  be changed  immediately. 4.3.1.2.15.  Only  repair  activities  are authorized  to use status  codes that  count  as repair cycle  days with  exception  of AWF, IID, INO, INR, and IRD. Table 4.1.  DIFM Status Codes.

DIFM status codes that count as post-repair (after) delayed maintenance days. DIFM Status codes that count as repair cycle days. DIFM status codes that count as awaiting part(s) days.  See AFI 23-101, Sec. 2C, Financial Management for examples of AWP time computations. DIFM status code that counts as repair cycle days for ACC and PACAF only.  For all others, these codes count as delayed maintenance days. When the first AWP due-out is established, the code on the end item DIFM detail record  will be changed to AWP under  program control.   When the second AWP due-out  is established, the code will change from AWP to 02P.  Subsequent  processing will increment or decrement  the status code counter  as appropriate, i.e., sequential processing will result in a code assignment:  AWP, 02P, 03P, 04P, etc. 03P, 02P, AWP, FWP.  DFM inputs attempting to change the DIFM status code from AWP or (nn)P will reject 325. DWO should be assigned to UJC AR/BR requirements  when Maintenance determines the asset must be retained on the system.  This status code applies when an asset request for an AWP requirement  results in a due-out.  There will be no status automatically assigned to the DIFM detail that is created and Maintenance has 3 days to determine  if the reparable asset should be removed  from  the AWP end item for a bench check, or if it is more practical to leave the AWP end item on the system and wait for a sub-component  replacement item.  If Maintenance decides to keep the asset on the system, they will assign DIFM status code DWO (UJC AR/BR, retained on system).  If Maintenance decides to remove the asset for bench check, normal  procedures for local repair or delivery to a central repair facility apply. Status code FEM will be assigned when the request has UJC AU, BU, or CU, and the delivery destination field contains FEM. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 311 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 When the last AWP due-out is released or canceled, the code on the end item DIFM detail record  will be changed to FWP under  program control.   DIFM codes attempting to change the DIFM status code to FWP will also output  a 318 REJ notice (Status Field Blank or in Error).   When the status of an item changes from FWP, the DFM input must contain a force code (F) in position 62 in addition to the new status code.  Without the force code, a 318 REJ notice will occur. LRS/Materiel Management Activity may assign TIN status code when the item is in their possession and the turn-in cannot be processed because the item record is frozen, an identity problem  exists, or similar conditions exist.  Ensure that processing standards for NRTS code 1 items are adhered to and assign a DIFM location code indicating the supply location.  All credit DIFM details will have status code TIN (Turn-in to LRS/Materiel Management Activity ) assigned under program  control at time of turn-in. Status code VHM can only be applied against type organization V or T. These codes count as repair cycle days when changed to a repair-type DIFM status code. MWI, PDM, TCG, and TOC are considered a separate category of delayed maintenance time and stored in the Delayed Other Days field on the DIFM detail record. Status code MWP counts as awaiting parts days and must be manually updated using DFM input processing. Days are not counted  as issued DIFM days when items are in DIFM status codes AWP, CTR, DWP, MWI, MWP, PDM, TCG, and TOC. When the DIFM status field is changed to CTR, an I125 MGT notice (Contract Repair Only the Quantity Indicated Time XXXX) will be printed.  This notice will reflect the number  of items that should be repaired based on the computed  requirements.   When items are no longer required  for base support, the number  shown in the condemn field of the management notice will be for the entire DIFM detail quantity.  In this instance, status code CTR will not be loaded to the DIFM detail and the items no longer needed should be turned  in as excess to the base requirements.  The TIN (transaction identification number)  input should have the action taken code 7 in pos. 62 and TRM in pos. 48-50.  When a known  requirement exists, but it is not apparent from the computed  requirement,  a force code (F) in position 62 of the DFM input will allow status code CTR to be assigned and the repair field of the management notice will show the entire DIFM quantity. 312 17 18 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 When DIFM status CEH is used the last three digits of the CE work order number  must be entered in positions 52-54 of the DFM input or reject 429 will occur. MWI is authorized for use by ICBM and Remote Alaskan Radar Sites maintenance only. 4.3.2.  Due-In From  Maintenance (DIFM) Updates. 4.3.2.1.  Purpose.  To describe  the procedures  for updating  DIFM records in  the ILS-S. 4.3.2.2.  DIFM Detail  Records. Replacement  requests  using  activity  code X (Expedite),  R (Routine),  J (Maintenance  IT system),  or S (Supply  Point)  with  demand  codes N, R, T, or U  will  automatically  place  the  removed  item  under  DIFM  procedures  when  the  request either  issues  or  backorders.  (Detailed  information  on  the  issue  of  repair  cycle  items  is available  in  AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5B, Order and Requisitioning) 4.3.2.3.  All  issues  to Contract  Maintenance  or in-house  repair  (activity  code C) are placed under  DIFM  control  regardless  of  ERRCD  or  demand  code.  A  DIFM  detail  record  is established  in  the  ILS-S to track the  removed  item  through  the  repair  cycle  and to  ensure that  assets  are,  1)  repaired,  2)  evacuated,  or  3)  condemned,  as  quickly  as  possible.  The status  and  location  of  each  item  will  be  updated  as  soon  as each  applicable  maintena nce activity  provides  the  new information. 4.3.2.4.  DIFM  Detail  Change  Transaction.  The  DIFM  Detail  Change  transaction  is  used to change  selected  data on  the  DIFM and  unserviceable  detail  records.  The  DIFM  Detail Change  transaction  input  allows  updating  of  repair  shop, location,  and  status  on the DIFM detail  record. Only  memo  and firm  DIFM detail  records (DIFM  status  flags  0, 1, 3, and 4) can  be  updated  by  the  DIFM  Detail  Change  transaction input.  DIFM  Detail  Change transaction  inputs  will  never  result  in  any  update  to  a  credit  DIFM  detail  record  (DIFM status  flag  2), since  a credit detail  indicates  the DIFM is no longer  in Maintenance.  Updated data resulting  from  DIFM  Detail  Change  transaction  inputs  will  appear on the  next  DIFM listing.     Note:  The  date of  last  change  field  is  updated  only  when  the  DIFM status  field is  changed. 4.3.2.4.1.  Input  Format  and  Entry  Requirements.  DIFM  Detail  Change  transaction transactions  must  be input  during  inline  processing.   The  DFM input  format  and entry requirements  are below. 4.3.2.4.2.  Output.  When  a terminal  is  used,  I006 MGT  Notice  (Input  Accepted)  will be printed.  This  management  notice  will  also  contain  the  phrase  NO UPDATE  if  the input  did not  result  in  an update to the DIFM detail.  Other rejects/management  notices may  also  be produced (see AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7 ) for  additional  informa t io n on reject  and management  notices. Table 4.2.

These  fields  will  be left  blank  unless  a change  is  desired. 2.  This  data is  carried  over  from  the DIFM detail  record and has no  effect  on internal  processing. 3.  Enter  6-position  Deficiency  Report number  in  pos. 45-50.  For example,  report number  87-1234 would  be entered  as 7-1234 or 871234. 4.  Leave  blank  unless  DIFM status  code CEH is  used in  positions  63-65.  For CEH only,  enter  the last  three  digits  of the  CE work order number  from  AF Form  1445, Materials and Equipment List (Approved  for  EF in  WIMS).  The  last  three  digits  of the  work order number  must  be all  numeric  or reject  429 will  occur. 5.  The  input  system  designator  must  equal  (be the  same  as) the  detail  system  designator. 6.  Input  force  disposition  code D if  the DIFM is  to be force  reported. 7.  An  asterisk  (*) in  the least  significant  character  of any  of these  fields  will  result  in  the corresponding  field  on the DIFM  detail  record being  blanked. 8.  Enter  a locally  assigned  code to indicate  the location  of the  DIFM asset.  Normally  the applicable  shop code is  used for  this  purpose  (for  example,  HS for  hydraulic  shop, or HS1, HS2, etc., when  there  is  more  than  one  hydraulic  shop on base).  If  the item  has been turned  in  to the Materiel  Management  Activity,  enter  a meaningful  location  to indicate  the  location  of the  asset pending  turn-in  (for  example,  FSC for  Flight  Service  Center, INE for  Inspection,  etc.).  If  the  item is  in  Contract  Maintenance,  enter  any  meaningful  data to identify  the vendor/contractor  or the estimated  repair  date (ERD)  using  the last  three  digits  of the  Julian  date. 9.  Enter  an F to force  load  specific  DIFM status  codes as indicated  in  Para  4.3.1, Standard  DIFM Status  Codes. 314 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 10.  When  a change  is desired,  this  field  must  contain  a three  position  alpha  code or a Z in  the most significant  character  (position  63) followed  by two alpha/numeric  characters.   (See Table 4.1 for standard  DIFM status  codes.) 11.  This  field  may  be blank  or contain  a specific  DIFM flag.   Regardless  of the input  DIFM flag,  a search  will  be made,  and if  any  detail  can be located  (other  than  credit),  it  will  be updated.   Based on the  input  DIFM  flag,  the  program  will  search  for  DIFM detail  records in  the following  sequence and update  whenever  the  first  equal  condition  is  encountered: a.  Input  DIFM status  flag  is  0, 2, 3, 4 or blank: (1)  Firm  DIFM with  equal  document  number. (2)  Memo DIFM with  equal  document  number. b.  Input  DIFM status  flag  1: (1)  Memo DIFM with  equal  document  number. (2)  Firm  DIFM with  equal  document  number. 12.  Positions  67-80 are used differently  as indicated  under  the  following  conditions: a)  For firm  DIFM details  (DIFM status  flag  0, 3, 4) for  type organization  codes 7, 8, 9, G, I, or V, positions  74-76 can be used  to update  the  SRD, WUC, or CC on the DIFM detail  record.  The change-to  data must  be entered  in  the following  format:  Figure  4.1.  Inputs  for DIFM Details (Status Flag 0,3, & 4). 4.3.3.  DIFM Penalty Charges.  AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 315 4.3.3.1.  Purpose.  To describe  the assessment  of  DIFM penalty  charges. 4.3.3.2.  Penalty  Charge. A penalty  charge  equal  to the  022-Markup-Price may  be assessed to Materiel  Support  Division  (budget  code 8)  XD2  items  that  remain  in  DIFM  status  for over 60 days. 4.3.3.3.  Criteria  for Assessment.  Budget  Code 8, XD2 assets will  be reviewed  by the inline follow-up  processing  and  if  the  following  criteria  is  met  the  customer  will  be charged  the 022-Markup-Price,  a  transaction  history  (TTPC:  7Y,  DOCID:  1PU)  will  be  created,  and the  DIFM Status  Flag  will  be changed  to a 4. 4.3.3.3.1.  Current  DIFM  status  code  is  other  than  MWI,  PDM,  CTR,  AWP,  DWP, TCG, TOC, or (nn)P. 4.3.3.3.2.  (Current  002-JULIAN-DATE  minus  203-ISSUE-DUO-RELEAS E-DATE minus  the 203-AWP-DAYS  minus  the 203-DELAYED-OTHER-DAYS)   > 60 days. 4.3.3.4.  Credit  Upon  Turn-In.  When  the  DIFM item  is  eventually  turned  in,  credit  will  be granted  based on  the  serviceability  of  the  turn-in.  If  the  item  is  turned  in  serviceable  then the  101-STANDARD-PRICE  will  be credited.  If  the item  is unserviceable,  the  022-Mark-Up price  will  be credited. 4.3.4.  Specifying  the Condition  of Returned  Materiel. 4.3.4.1.  Purpose.  To  provide  a list  of  the  action  taken  codes  used  on  turn-in  requests  for DIFM items  to indicate  the  actions  taken by  maintenance  and LRS/Materiel  Management Activity. Table 4.3.  Maintenance and  Supply  Action  Taken Codes. Code Description Remarks/ Notes A B C D F G J K Bench  checked and repaired. Bench  checked--serviceable  (no repair required).

Action  taken code used  for turn-in  of EOQ items  will  be blank  with  the following exceptions: a.  Serviceable  turn-in  from  detail  records such  as WRM will  contain  supply  action taken  code T. b.  Action  taken code U will  decrease the cumulative  recurring  demands  by the quantity  turned  in. c.  When  the  item  turned  in  is a Deficiency Report  exhibit,  use supply  condition  code Q and action  taken code C.  For Deficiency Report  credit  policy,  see the  materiel deficiency  procedures. Notes: 1.  Action  taken code D is  used to indicate  an item  was 1) bench  checked  at a forward  operating  base, dispersed  operating  base, or en route  base, 2) found to be unserviceable,  and 3) transferred  to a main  operating  base or home  base for  repair.   If  a turn-in  input  contains  a supplementary  address in  positions  45-50, action  taken  code D will  cause  the  item  to be shipped  to that  address.  Do not use  code D for turn-in  of items  with  ERRCD  XB, and do not use  it  when shipping  unserviceable  items  to Inventory  Managers,  special  repair  activities, or other  official  depot level  repair  functions. 2.  Under  the  conditions  listed  below,  items  turned  in  with  other action  taken codes will  be shipped  to other  Air  Force bases and the  code will  be automatically  changed  to D. a.  Override  record address.  When  the  override  record correlates  with  the shipment  exception  code, the  item  is  shipped  to the  override  record address. b.  Reparable  destination  address.  When  the  reparable  destination/  disposition code contains  an address, the item  is shipped  to that  address. c.  Missing  address reject.  When  the  turn-in  does not direct  a shipment  to another  Air  Force base, an invalid  action  taken  code reject will  be generated. 3.  Action  Taken  Code 8 forces  the  automatic  shipment  of items  to AFMC depots.  Do not  use it  with  ERRCD  XB items;  do not  use it  for  shipment  to sources  of supply  other  than  AFMC; and do not  use it  when  the Inventory Manager  directs  the return  of  an AWP asset for  lack  of parts. 4.3.5.  Maintenance Turnaround  Processing. 4.3.5.1.  Purpose.  To describe  the  processing  of  maintenance  turnarounds  (TRN)  and  the TRN input  transaction. 318 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 4.3.5.2.  Effects  of  TRN  Processing.  Processing  a  TRN  will  have  the  same  effect  as  an issue,  repair  and subsequent  serviceable  turn-in  of a XD*/XF*  asset. The  TRN will  update both the demand  data on the item  record and the repair cycle  data on the repair cycle  record. The  fields  that  will  be updated  on the  item/repair  cycle  record are as follows. 4.3.5.2.1.  Item  Record.    Number  of  demands,  cumulative  recurring  demands,  and DOLD for  the  item  record current  period. 4.3.5.2.2.  Repair  Cycle  Record.  Number  of  assets  repaired,  current  quarter  net  repair cycle  days, and action  taken code for  the Repair  Cycle  Record Current  quarter.    Note:  If TRN is used for Supply  Point  items,  then  the DOLT on the supply  point  detail  record will  not be updated. 4.3.5.3.  TRN  Data.  Data  for  processing  a TRN will  be provided  to  the  TRN manager  by the maintenance  activity  on AFTO Form  350. The  TRN manager  will  use the AFTO Form 350 to prepare and  process a maintenance  turnaround  input. 4.3.5.3.1.  TRN Stock Number.  Local  quick  reference  lists  may  be developed  to allow for  identification  of high  demand  items  by the  TRN manager. 4.3.5.3.2.  TRN Document  Number.  The  LRS CC/AO must  choose from  two differe nt options  for  the TRN document  number. 4.3.5.3.2.1.  Option  1  is  to  use  the  actual  Organization  and  Shop  Code  of  the maintenance  activity  in  the  TRN document  number. 4.3.5.3.2.2.  Option  2 is to use organization  code 009 followed  by a locally  assigned production  control  identification  number  in  the  shop code field.  When  production control  numbers  are  used,  the  TRN  manager  will  assign  each  Maintenance Production  Control  being  supported  a number  between  01 and 99. If  this  option  is used  the  TRN  manager  must  ensure  that  type  organization  code I  is  loaded  to  the OCCR for organization  code 009. 4.3.5.4.  TRN Input  Format. The  TRN input  is used to update demand  and repair cycle  data on an item  repaired  in  maintenance  but not physically  processed through  the LRS/Materie l Management  Activity. 4.3.5.4.1.  Input  Format  and Entry  Requirement  Restrictions.  RPS/main  system  or any terminal  during  normal  inline  processing.  Additionally,  TRNs  may  be  processed through format  and  entry requirements  are listed  below. the  maintenance informational system.  The input 4.3.5.4.2.  Output.  If  input  is  through  the  RPS/main  system,  an  I122  MGT  notice (Maintenance  Turn-Around  Transaction  Process  On)  or  the  applicable  reject  will  be output.  If  the  input  is  through  a  terminal,  management  notices  I006  MGT  and  I122 MGT  notice,  or an or applicable  reject,  will  be printed  back to the input  function. Table 4.4.

Part number  requests will contain a P in position 8, followed by the 14 most significant positions of the part number.   If the part number  is loaded it will convert to the appropriate  stock number.   The TRN manager coordinates all required  research by Maintenance (part number)  and Supply (stock number)  to ensure all part numbers  are converted  to a valid stock number  and stock numbers are loaded in the computer. Normally, the quantity  will be one.  Do not combine  data from  multiple AFTO Forms 350 on a single input.  If the correct quantity  cannot be determined return  the AFTO Form  350 for completion  prior to processing. The document  number  will be constructed  as in Table 4.5.  Maintenance Action Taken Code must be A, F, G, K, L, OR Z.  The AFTO Form  350 will be returned  to the appropriate  maintenance activity if a valid action taken code is not entered. Leave  positions  65-67 blank  unless  a 256 reject  has been received  indicating manual  computation  of net  repair  days  is needed  because the  repair  cycle  record quarters  are blank.   When  blank,  the  net  repair  cycle  days will  be computed programmatically.   The  net repair  cycle  days  are computed  as follows. New current  QTR RCT.  = [(Sum  of 5 quarters  RCT divided  by sum  of 5 quarters  RTS) times  the TRN  input  quantity]  + current  QTR RCT 320 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 To manually  compute  the  repair  cycle  days, multiply  the net  repair  cycle  days on the  AFTO Form  350 by the  quantity  turned  around.   Enter  the  result  in  positions 65-67. Net repair cycle days divided by the quantity turned  around  cannot be greater than 15 days or less than 1 day.  If the correct number  of days cannot be determined,  return  the AFTO Form  350 for completion  prior to processing. 7 If type organization is V, G, I, 7, 8, or 9, these fields cannot be blank.

Verification  of  Processing.   The  AFTO  Forms  350 will  be retained  and  filed  as locally  determined  until  TRN processing  is  verified. 4.3.5.5.1.  Successful  Processing.   Successful  processing  of  a TRN is  indicated  by  an I122 MGT  notice.   When  the  I122 MGT  notice  is  received  the  AFTO  Form  350 may be disposed  of.  The  I122 MGT notice  will  be distributed  as follows: 4.3.5.5.1.1.  Copy 1--applicable  Production  Control 4.3.5.5.1.2.  Copy 2--TRN Manager 4.3.5.5.1.3.  Copies  3 and 4--as locally  determined. 4.3.5.5.2.  Daily  Document  Register.   The  Daily  Document  Register  (D04) may  also be used to monitor  TRN processing.   The  D04 lists  all  transactions  that  processed the day before.   The  AFTO  350 should  be compared  to the  D04 to  ensure  the  TRN  input  has been  processed.  When  this  option  is  used,  the  TRN manager  will  retain  copy  2 of  the register,  distribute  copy  3  to  the  applicable  Production  Control,  and  use  copy  4  as locally  determined. 4.3.6.  Awaiting  Parts   (AWP)  Checklist. 4.3.6.1.  Purpose.  To describe  and explain  the  usage  of the  AWP checklist  at base level. 4.3.6.2.  Use of AWP Checklists.  The  use of an AWP checklist  to assist  in  requesting  parts and  monitoring  active  AWP  requisitions  is  mandatory.  The  checklist  should  be used  for AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 321 requesting  parts  and  monitoring  active  AWP  requisitions.  The  MAJCOM  and  local  LRS CC/AO may  supplement  it. Table 4.6.  AWP  Checklist. 1.  Has the accountable  officer  appointed  primary  and alternate  AWP monitors  in  writing? 2.

Has lateral  support  been requested  when  applicable? 20.  If  lateral  support  is unsuccessful,  attempt  to cross-cannibalize  parts to make  as many serviceable  assets as possible. 21.  Is ES-S used  to source  worldwide  assets for  possible  lateral  support  of bits  and pieces? 22.  Have  TRIC/DIC  AFC follow- ups  or upgrades  been initiated?   If not,  contact  AFMC SCM-R Stock Control  Activity  for  necessary  processing  actions. 322 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 23.  Consider  locally  purchasing/using  Government-Wide  Purchase  Card (GPC) for  selected problem  items.   Before  attempting  a local  purchase,  ensure  you  have  complied  with  the  provisions contained  in  AFMAN 23-122, Sec 3B, Local  Purchase  and Retail  Sales,  GPC guidelines  , and AFI 21-123, Air Force Repair  Enhancement Program (AFREP). 24.  After  30 days with  unacceptable/bad  status,  has  AWP supply  assistance  correspondence  to the SOS been  initiated? 25.  If  all  of the  above efforts  have  been made,  has a command  supply  assistance  request  message been sent  to MAJCOM detailing  all  actions  taken  to satisfy  the  requirements?   Does the  message include  the  number  of units  AWP, and how many  MICAPs have  resulted  due to the  AWP. 26.  Is part 1 of  the D19 reviewed  for the  following:  See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 5. 26.1  Is there  a positive  due-in  for  each due-out? 26.2  If  maintenance  decides  to retain  the  AWP bit/piece  on the end-item,  is  DIFM status  code DWO (UJC AR/BR  retained  on system)  loaded  to the AWP detail?   (paragraph  4.3.1.) 26.3  Is there  shipment  status  or a realistic  estimate  release  date? 27.  Is a copy of the  AWP validation  listing  (D19)  being  provided  to each  shop storing  AWP end-items,  for monitoring  and  processing? 28.  When  the  decision  is  made to cancel  parts on order for an  end-item,  is  the  AWP manager advising  maintenance  to turn  in  the item  for  evacuation  (NRTS 4)? 29.  Is TWP status  loaded  to bits  and pieces  in-transit  to off-base  activities  when  delivery  will  take more  than  2 days? 30.  Are items  maintained  in  TWP for  a maximum  of 10 days? Note:  This  checklist  is not  all-inclusive.   It should  be used in  conjunction  with  locally  devised checklists.   AFI 23-101 and AFMAN 23-122 are the  applicable  guidance  unless  otherwise  noted. 4.3.7.  General AWP  Processing Procedures. 4.3.7.1.  Purpose. This  section  contains  general  AWP processing  procedures  for requesting repair  parts,  mark-for  field  requirements,  serviceability  requirements,  ILS-S  associated detail  records, and reporting  AWP changes. 4.3.7.2.  AWP Responsibilities.  The LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  and Maintenance have  the  following  responsibilities: 4.3.7.2.1.  The  FSC will: 4.3.7.2.1.1.  Convert  requested  part numbers  to valid  stock numbers  when  required publications  are available. 4.3.7.2.1.2.  Place  customer  demands  on  the  ILS-S  for  repair  parts  (MAJCOM option). 4.3.7.2.1.3.  Store  the  end-item  until  all  bits  and  pieces  have  been  received (MAJCOM option). AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 323 4.3.7.3.  Customer  Request  for  Repair  Parts. Organizational  requests  for  bits  and pieces  to repair unserviceable  end-items  in the maintenance  repair cycle  will  be prepared as specified in  Para  5.2.1.  Use either  urgency  justification  code (UJC) AR or BR, as appropriate. is  required  between 4.3.7.4.  DIFM  Detail  Record  Status  Updates.  Close  coordination Maintenance  and  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  to  ensure  that  DIFM  update (DFM) transactions  are processed as required  to update  the  D23/NGV905 when  the  status of the  DIFM end-item  changes.  See Para  4.3.2 for  more  information  concerning  the  DFM transaction.  See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for more  information  concerning  the  D23 program.  Note:   Maintenance  organizations  must  ensure  that  the  correct  AWP  delivery destination  is  entered  in  the  organization  record (OCCR) when  AWP repair  parts are to be delivered  directly  to maintenance  shop holding  areas. 4.3.7.5.  ILS-S AWP  Processing.  Depending  upon  the  transaction  exception  code  (TEX) used,  AWP  customer  backorder  processing  will  be  as  follows  for  UJC  AR/BR.  Bases submit  AWP  requisitions  for  repair  parts  on  a  “fill  or  backorder”  basis.  The  ILS-S  will automatically  assign  project  code  “AWP”  to  the  due-in  detail  record  and  generate  a corresponding  requisition  A0(*) output  transaction  with  AWP in the project code field,  and requisition  advice  code 6L (AFMC-managed).  See Ch 5 for  more  information  concerning the  requisition  project  code  and  advice  code  fields.  Note:   Repair  Cycle  Support  or  the AWP  monitor,  in  conjunction  with  Maintenance,  will  decide  the  proper  action  required when  unsatisfactory  supply  status  is  received  for  parts  to  repair  cycle  items  containing ERRCD  XF3. 4.3.7.5.1.  Mark-For Field  Edits.  If the customer  issue  (ISU) input  transaction  contains a blank  TEX  code, or any  TEX  code except 4, 6, E or Y, then  the input  mark-for  field, positions  67-80,  must  contain  a  DIFM  or  authorized/in-use  detail  record  document number.  If  the  detail  record  cannot  be located,  the  ILS-S will  reject  the  issue  request. If  the  DIFM  quantity  is  greater  than  one,  or  if  more  than  one  DIFM  detail  record  is located  for the stock number  in  the ILS-S (such  as one firm  and one memo  detail),  then the  TEX  code must  be 4 (fill  or kill).  Once killed,  firm  customer  backorder  (due-out) records will  be established  for the repair  parts, and DIFM status  (AWP) assigned  to the end-item  DIFM detail  record. 4.3.7.5.1.1.  When  the  customer  issue  request  contains  TEX  E, the  mark-for  field, positions  67-80, must  be structured  as specified  in  Para  5.2.11.  For example,  the end-item  serial  number  must  be  entered  in  pos.  67-73,  the  standard  reporting designator  (SRD)  in  positions  74-76, the  work  unit  code (WUC)  in  positions  77-78, and the  command  code in  positions  79-80. 4.3.7.5.1.2.  When  the  customer  issue  request  contains  TEX  code  4, 6,  or  V,  the mark-for  field  is  not  edited  by  the  ILS-S  because  customer  backorder  (due-out) records are not  created. Additionally,  the SRD  must  be entered  in  the project  code field,  positions  57-59. 4.3.7.5.2.  Memo  Due-Out  Processing.  When  the  decision  is  made  to  firm  up  an existing  AWP memo  due-out,  the  applicable  advice  code and AWP project  code must be entered  in  the  special  requisition  (SPR)  transaction.  Note:  The  advice  code cannot be modified  if  left  blank.  Therefore,  only  the project code can be modified  using  a due-324 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 in/due-out  update (DIT)  transaction.  See Para  5.2.71 for more  information  concerning DIT  transaction  processing. 4.3.7.5.3.  DIFM  Status  Code Assignment.  The  ILS-S  normally  assigns  AWP  status codes on DIFM detail  records.  The  following  DIFM status  codes will  be assigned  as a result  of AWP processing: 4.3.7.5.3.1.  When  the  first  bit  and  piece  AWP due-out  is  established,  status  code “AWP”  will  be assigned  to the  end-item  DIFM detail  record. 4.3.7.5.3.2.  When the second bit and piece AWP due-out is established,  status  code AWP will  be changed  to “02P”  on the  end-item  DIFM  detail  record  by the  ILS-S. When  the  third  bit  and  piece  due-out  is  established,  status  code  02P  will  be increased  to 03P, etc. 4.3.7.5.3.3.  As bit  and piece  AWP due-outs due-out  release (DOR), cancel  (DOC), etc., the  DIFM  status  code will  be decreased  by  the  ILS-S from  03P to 02P; from 02P to AWP; etc., on the  end-item  DIFM detail  record. 4.3.7.5.3.4.  When  the  last  bit  and  piece  AWP due-out  is  released  or canceled,  the ILS-S will  automatically  change  the DIFM status  code from  AWP to “FWP” on the end-item  DIFM detail  record. Additionally,  the DIFM  advice  code and transaction date will  be blanked. 4.3.7.6.  AWP  Validation  Listing  (D19)  Processing.  AFMC will  review  Part  I  of  the D19, AWP Validation  Listing,  to ensure  a linked  due-in  exists  for each  AWP due-out, shipment  status  or realistic  estimated  delivery  dates,  and  additional  or special  action follow-ups  as  required.  Note:  The  applicable  AFMC  may  define  specific limited actions  for  the  AWP  monitor  to  perform  such  as  lateral  support  or  preparation  and processing  of  follow- up  transactions.  See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  5  for  D19 processing  procedures  and  output  formats.  Lateral  support  is  authorized  for  AWP requirements  only  if  it  will  resolve  the AWP condition  for  the  end item. 4.3.7.7.  Returning  Assets  to  Serviceable  Condition.  Both  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity  and  Maintenance  must  closely  monitor  AWP end-items  to ensure  that  assets  are returned  to  serviceable  condition  as  soon  as  possible.  As  appropriate,  cannibaliza t io n action,  local  purchase  of  bit  and  piece  parts, supply  difficulty  letters,  manual  follow- ups, and lateral  support  should  all  be utilized  when  appropriate.  See the AWP checklist  in  Para 4.3.6 for  a list  of  actions  that  should  be taken. 4.3.7.8.  AWP Hold  Times.  AWP hold  times  for  items  not centrally  managed  by AFMC or other  DoD  agencies  will  be determined  by  the  base.  When  establishing  local  AWP  hold times,  consider  the  availability  of  parts,  sources  of  repair,  pipeline  times,  etc.  Items  not centrally  managed  normally  include  items  coded for local  procurement,  and items  procured locally  under  HQ AFMC contracts  for  commercial  type aircraft. 4.3.8.  Special AWP  Processing Procedures. 4.3.8.1.  Purpose.  To  describe  special  procedures  concerning management  of Awaiting  Parts (AWP) customer  backorders. ILS-S  processing  and 4.3.8.2.  AWP Repair  Cycle  Item.  When  a repair  cycle  item  (ERRCD  XF/XD)  is  required to  repair  an  unserviceable  end-item,  process  the  customer  issue  request  with  urgency AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 325 justification  code  (UJC)  AR  or  BR.  The  issue  request  must  contain  the  AWP  end-item DIFM  detail  document  number  in  positions  67-80.  If  other  repair  bits  and  pieces  are on order for  the  unserviceable  end-item  when  maintenance  receives  the  ordered repair  cycle item,  the maintenance  shop scheduler  will  initiate  action  to load DIFM status  code “DWP” on  the  DIFM  detail  record  of  the  item  received  using  a  DIFM  status  update  (DFM) transaction.  DWP status  indicates  the  item  received  is  a component  of  another  repair  cycle item  in  AWP status.  The specific  time  periods  for maintaining  items  in  DWP status  are the same  as  those  required  for  items  in  AWP  status.  See  Para  4.3.1  for  more  informa t io n concerning the  DFM transaction  input. the  loading  of  DWP  status  on  the  DIFM  detail  record  using 4.3.8.3.  AWP  Bit  and  Piece.  If  the  bits  and  pieces  received  are  required  for  an  off-base activity  and extended  periods  of time  (greater  than  2 days) are required  for delivery  to the requester,  the DIFM detail  record for the AWP end-item  will  be coded “TWP.”  TWP status indicates  bits and pieces required  for repair are currently  in-transit.  The specific  time  period for  maintaining  an item  in  TWP status  is  10 calendar  days  plus  the  AWP days. 4.3.8.4.  AWP Requisition  Status  and  Cancellation  Codes. The  ILS-S will  generate  a 421 reject  (input  must  be  coded  with  TEX  9,  P,  or  R)when  CB  (quantity  not  availab le) requisition  status  is received  for an AWP requisition,  and the status  (AE1) transaction  does not  contain  transaction  exception  code (TEX)  9 or  R in  position  51. See  Para  5.2.87 for more  information  concerning  CB status  code processing.  See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for  more  information  concerning  421 reject. 4.3.8.4.1.  TEX  9. TEX  9 indicates  both  the  due-in  and  due-out  detail  records  should both  be  canceled.  If  the  input  TEX  (position  51)  equals  9, the  ILS-S  will  interna lly create and process a customer  due-out cancellation  transaction  with  maintenance  action taken  code (ATC)  B and  TEX  9. Note:  The  cancellation  of  due-in  and due-out  detail records  will  not  reduce  the  cumulative  recurring  demand  (CRD)  for  the  repair  parts cancelled  because  the  end-item  has  been  coded  lack  of  parts  (NRTS  4).  See  Para 5.2.100 for  more  information  concerning  the  due-out  cancellation  transaction  input. 4.3.8.4.2.  TEX  R. TEX  R indicates  the  due-in  detail  record should  be canceled  and a new  requisition  with  a  new  requisition  document  number  should  be  created  for  the canceled  quantity. 4.3.8.4.3.  Assignment  of  TEX  9 or R. Assignment  of TEX  9 or R on AWP requisit io n cancellations  will  be jointly  determined  by  Maintenance  and  LRS/Materie l Management  Activity. 4.3.8.4.3.1.  The  fourth  line  on  the  421  Reject  indicates  the  applicable  customer due-out  so that  the  AWP manager  can  readily  identify  the requester. 4.3.8.4.3.2.  If  the  joint  decision  is  to  cancel  both  the  due-in  and  due-out  detail records,  the  AWP manager  will  advise  Maintenance  to turn  the  AWP end-item  in to  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  for  evacuation  (maintenance  action taken  code 4). 4.3.8.4.3.3.  The  AWP manager  will  enter  TEX  9 in  position  51 of  the  requisit io n status  (AE1)  transaction  and reprocess the transaction  to cancel  the due-in  and due-out  detail  records.  See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  5  for  more  informa t io n 326 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 concerning  requisition  status  processing. 4.3.8.5.  Storing  AWP  End-Items  in  Maintenance  Shops.  Each  MAJCOM has  the  option of  storing  AWP  end-items  in  the  maintenance  shops.  The  establishment,  location,  and maintenance  of  AWP  suspense  files  will  also  be  determined  by  the  MAJCOM.  The LRS/accountable  officer  is  responsible  for:  1) requisitioning,  2) lateral  support,  3) follow -up,  4)  monitoring  status.  LRS/maintenance  is  responsible  for  evacuating  reparable  end-items.  If  the  AWP end-item  is  stored  in  maintenance  shops, the  shops  will  request  all  bits and  pieces  from  the  applicable  Customer  Service  function  with  the  appropriate  urgency justification  code (AR/BR)  and the end-item  DIFM detail  document  number.  A copy of the AWP Validation  Listing  (D19)  will  be provided  to each  shop  storing  AWP end-items  for the  management,  monitoring,  and  processing  of  AWP end-items.  AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for more  information  concerning  the  D19 program. 4.3.8.6.  Cross-Cannibalization.  Both  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity and maintenance  shop  managers  are responsible  for  reviewing  the  D19  report  to determine  if cross-cannibalization  is  possible.  Cross-cannibalization  of serviceable  bits and pieces from one  AWP  end-item  to  another  may  serve  to  repair  one  or  more  AWP  end  items.  When cross-cannibalization  is  possible,  the  maintenance  shop  is  responsible  for  providing  the LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  AWP  manager  with  the  end-item  DIFM  document number(s)  and  the  bits  and  pieces  involved.  This  joint  responsibility  concerning  cross-cannibalization  ensures  the ILS-S contains  a record of cannibalization  actions  and the most updated  status  for  each DIFM. 4.3.8.7.  AFMC  Directed  Evacuation.  Regional  repair  bases  (for  example,  CRFs  and Primary  Supply  Points)  will  be  exempt  from  AFMC  directed  evacuation  because  their repair  need  is  based on  multiple  base locations  not  just  the  asset  position  at the  regional repair  base. 4.3.8.7.1.  When  an  XE8  is  received  with  AWP  disposition  code  2  (evacuate)  or  3 (dispose),  the  disposition  code will  be stored  in  the  Disposition  Response  Code field (second  position  of the  FILLER-2)  of  the  appropriate  DIFM  detail.  These  details  will be listed  on the DIFM-AWP Disposition  Report (D41/NGV887). The D41 will  be made available  to the  Flight  Service  Center  (FSC) and maintenance  for  daily  review. 4.3.8.7.2.  The FSC and AFMC will  review  AWPs on a daily  basis (Discoverer  or other automated  ILSS queries  may  be used.) If  an  unserviceable  end-item  has  been in  AWP status  for  30 days, AFMC AWP monitor  will  contact  the  item  manager  responsible  for the bits  and pieces  or SRUs on order to repair  the unserviceable  item.  If delivery  of the bits  and  pieces  or SRUs  cannot  be guaranteed  prior  to the  DIFM  detail  reflecting  45 days  of  AWP  status,  AFMC  AWP  monitor  will  contact  the  end-item  manager  and request  disposition  instructions.  Upon  receipt  of  IM  disposition,  the  FSC and  AFMC will  direct  Maintenance  to cease all  attempts  to repair  and  turn  the  asset in  within  one workday.  Any  remaining  bit  and  piece due-outs  should  be cancelled. 4.3.8.7.3.  Maintenance  will  use Action  Taken  Code 8 (bench  checked--return  to depot facility  by direction  of  system  manager  or item  manager)  on  the unserviceable  turn- in resulting  from  Item  Manager  direction. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 327 4.3.8.7.4.  Condition  Code  F  will  normally  be  used  on  the  unserviceable turn- in, however,  condition  code  G  is  authorized  if  the  AWP  end-item  being  evacuated  is missing  components.  A  complete  list  of  items  missing  (stock  number,  quantity, ERRCD,  and nomenclature)  will  be annotated  on  the  reverse  side  of  the  condition  tag or on  a separate  list  securely  attached  to the  condition  tag.  When  condition  code G  is used,  the  FSC (or supply  turn-in  point)  must  validate  that  any  ERRCD  XF/XD  items listed  as missing  were  previously  evacuated  (as  indicated  by  the  presence  of  a credit DIFM  detail).  This  is  to  ensure  that  these  component  items  are  not  removed  and retained  prior  to turn-in  of the  end item. is  authorized 4.3.8.7.5.  When  evacuation  or  disposal  is  directed,  Maintenance to evacuate  or dispose  of  an  item  in  the  same  Interchange  and  Substitution  group  (ISG). However,  any  item  being  turned-in  for disposal  as directed  by  the Item  Manager  must also  be in  AWP  condition  and  in  the  same  or less  preferred  subgroup  in  the  ISG. For example,  if  the  directed  evacuation/disposal  is  received  on  an  item  in  subgroup  AB, then  any  other  AWP item  in  the  same  (AB)  or lesser  (AA)  subgroup  can  be turned - in for  disposal,  but  items  in  subgroup  AC and  higher  cannot  be turned  in  to  satisfy  the disposal  direction.  Items  turned  in  for evacuation  as directed  by the Item  Manager  must also  be in  AWP condition  but the subgroup  restriction  does not apply  (that  is,  any  item in  the  ISG,  even  more  preferred  subgroups,  can  be  evacuated  to  comply  with  the evacuation  directive). 4.3.8.7.6.

Any  item  in  stock  that  requires  contract  maintenance  will  be issued  using  activity  code C. This  type  of  issue  will  result  in  DIFM control  regardless  of ERRCD  or demand  code. Demand  data is  not  updated  when  activity  code C is  used.  See Ch 5, for the  ISU format  and processing. 4.3.9.3.  AF  Form  9, Request  for Purchase.  AF Form  9  will  be used  to  process  items  to contract  maintenance  for  repair.  The  AF  Form  9  will  include  the  appropriate  fund  cite, signatures,  a suggested  repair  contractor  and  a statement  that  the  item  will  be returned  to the  maintenance  activity.  A copy  of  the  AF Form  9 will  be provided  to DIFM  monitor  in the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  and  the  DIFM  monitor  will  change  the  DIFM status  to CTR.  The  maintenance  activity  will  retain  a copy  of  the AF Form  9 in  suspense until  the  property  is  returned.   When  the  item  is  returned,  the  maintenance  activity  must verify  the condition  of  the  item,  prepare an DD  1574, Serviceable Tag-Materiel  and turn-in  the  item  to the LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity. the  maintenance  activit y 4.3.9.4.

See Para  5.2.45  for  more information  concerning  requisition  advice  codes.  If  the  item  is  not centrally  procured  by the source  of supply,  enter  appropriate  requisition  advice  code or leave  blank. c.  If  the source  of supply  is  other  than  AFMC, and the requisition  advice  code is blank  or 6(*), the  ILS-S will  assign  requisition  advice  code 2D. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 337 17.  If  the customer  request  is  for non-accountable  equipment  (activity  code is  P), the applicable  authority  for issue  flag  (Para  5.2.6) must  be entered  unless  the  item  ERRCD  equals NF1. 18.  If  the TEX  code is % (percent),  enter  a percentage  of discount  between  01 and 99.  See Para  5.2.11 for  more information.  5.2.3.  Issue From  Detail Record (MSI) Processing Instructions  and Transaction  Format.  5.2.3.1.  Purpose.   To  explain  preparation  instructions,  internal  edits,  and  procedures  to issue  assets  from  ILS-S  Supply  Point,  MSK,  WRM,  WRM/In-Use,  MRSP,  and unserviceable  detail  records. 5.2.3.2.  General  Issue  from  Detail  Record  Processing.    The  issue  of  assets  from  ILS-S detail  records requires  an Issue  from  Detail  input  transaction.   See Para  5.2.4 for  the  MSI input  transaction  format.    The  issue  from  detail  record  input  transaction  requires  the following  combination  of  activity  code and type  of issue  codes: 5.2.3.2.1.  If  the activity  code in  position  30 is  C, position  53 must  contain  M, R, S, U, or W. 5.2.3.2.2.  If  the activity  code is  R, position  53 must  be E, M, R, U, or W. 5.2.3.2.3.  If  the activity  code is  X or J position  53 must  be E, M, U, or W. 5.2.3.2.4.  If  the activity  code is  P, position  53 must  be R. 5.2.3.2.5.  If  the activity  code is S, position  53 must  also  be S.  Additionally,  positions 72-80 must  contain  the supply  point  detail  document  number  (Para  5.2.12). 5.2.3.3.  TEX  Code.  If  position  53 contains  an  R,  the  TEX  code in  position  51 must  be blank,  D, or @.  All  other MSI input  transactions  must  contain  a blank  or 6 in  position  51. 5.2.3.3.1.  TEX  D  - This  TEX  code  is  used  when  reimbursement  is  not  required  as determined  locally.   Caution:   Do not use  this  TEX  unless  approval  has been provided by the  Funds  Manager. 5.2.3.3.2.  TEX  Blank  - TEX  Blank,  upon  issue  from  MRSP detail  records, routes  the output  issue  documents identified  on  the  MRSP-IRSP-CONTROL  record.    If  the  025-OUTPUT-FUN-NUMBER  is  blank,  the  output document  is  returned  to the input  terminal. to  the  function  number 5.2.3.3.3.  TEX  6 – for  use with  degraded operations  procedures. 5.2.3.3.4.  TEX  @.  TEX  @, upon  issue  from  MRSP detail  records, routes  the  output issue  documents  to the  input  terminal.   TEX  @ overrides  the  function  number  on  the MRSP-IRSP-CONTROL record. 5.2.3.4.  Automatic  Issue  of Assets  Located  on Detail  Records.   In  some  cases, the  ILS-S automatically  searches  for, and issues,  assets from  detail  records.  For expedite  and routine issue  requests,  the  ILS-S takes the  following  actions: 5.2.3.4.1.  Mission  Support  Kit  (MSK)  and  Supply  Point  Assets.    If  a  routine  or expedite  issue  request  (activity  codes J, R, and X)--other than  manual  processing  (TEX 338 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 6),  TEX  code 8,  H,  or  Z  cannot  be satisfied,  the  ILS-S  will  search  for  MSK/supply point  details  with  the  requested  stock number.   If  assets are available  for  issue  located on MSK detail  records (not deployed),  or on supply  point  detail  records, the ILS-S will kill   LRS/Materie l Management  Activity,  in  coordination  with  the  requesting  organization,  should  take action  to issue  the available  assets from  the detail  records.  See  AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7  for more  information. the  unsatisfied  quantity  and  provide  an  I023  MGT  notice. 5.2.3.4.2.  Mobility  Readiness  Support  Package  (MRSP)  and  In-Place  Readiness Support  Package  (IRSP)  Assets.    In  some  cases,  the  ILS-S  will  automatically  issue available  assets located  on MRSP or IRSP detail  records.  However,  all  of the following conditions  must  be met: 5.2.3.4.2.1.  The  issue  request  activity  code equals  X, R, or J. 5.2.3.4.2.2.  The  UND is A or B. 5.2.3.4.2.3.  The  MRSP or IRSP detail  authorize-withdrawal- flag  is  not  set to N. 5.2.3.4.2.4.  The  MRSP detail  is  not deployed. 5.2.3.4.2.5.  The  MAJCOM  is  authorized  MRSP/IRSP  withdrawal. MAJCOMs that  are authorized  automatic  withdrawal  of MRSP/IRSP are contained on the  025-MRSP-IRSP-CONTROL record.  See Ch 2 for  load instructions.   Note:   5.2.3.4.2.6.  The  withdrawal  will  not  reduce  assets  on  hand  below  the  required percentage  fill  rate on the MRSP/IRSP control  record.  Note:   The ILS-S will  issue to zero balance  if  the input  UJC is MICAP and the  percent fill  is less  than  100% on the  MRSP-IRSP-CONTROL Record. 5.2.3.4.2.7.  If  all  of  the above conditions  are met,  the ILS-S automatically  formats an Issue from  Detail  (MSI) transaction  to issue  the asset from  the detail  record.  See Para  5.2.4  for  more  information  and  input  format  for  the  MSI  input  transaction.   The  ILS-S  continues  to  process  MSI  transactions  until  the  requested  quantity  is satisfied.   All  unsatisfied  quantities  are killed  and an I023 MGT notice  is provided.  5.2.3.4.2.8.  ISU  requests  with  TEX  M can  issue  from  RSP/IRSP  kits  if  all  of  the above  conditions  are  met.    This  prevents  bypassing  assets  that  were  receipted  in between  getting  the  I023  MGT  Notice  and  trying  to  backorder  with  a  TEX  M.  (Note:  This  does not apply  if  assets have  been DOR’d to an MSK or Supply  Point.   The  request  will  bypass  them  and backorder.) 5.2.3.5.  Manual  Issue of Items  Maintained  on Detail  Records.  Issues of equipment,  supply point,  MSK, MRSP,  and  WRM  items  require  corresponding  ILS-S  detail  records.   If  the corresponding  detail  record  cannot  be located,  the  ILS-S rejects  the  issue  request.   If  the request  is an issue  from  supply  point,  MSK, MRSP, WRM/in-use,  or unserviceable  details, the  issue  input  transaction  rejects  if  the  requested  stock number  is  frozen  for  inventory  or if  insufficient  quantities  are  available.    If  the  request  is  satisfied  from  an  unserviceab le detail  record,  the  ILS-S rejects  the  input  if  the  unserviceable  detail  or the  item  record  for input  stock  number  and system  designator  cannot  be found.   If  the  issue  input  transaction activity  code is unequal  to S, the  ILS-S rejects if  the input  contains  organization  code 005.  If  the  request  is  for  a WRM  or MRSP  detail  record  item  and  the  detail  record  contains  a AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 339 least  acceptable  code,  the  issue  request  could  result  in  either  an  issue  or  backorder depending  on the value  of the least  acceptable  code.  If  the 101-ISG-SOURCE code has an equal  or greater  value  than  the least  acceptable  code, the asset can be issued.   See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 2F, Readiness  Spares Packages  and Kits for  detailed  procedures. 5.2.3.5.1.  Issues from  Supply  Point  Detail  Records.  All  issues  from  supply  point  detail records are considered  “over-the-counter.”   The recipient’s  signature  is  required  for all over-the-counter  issues  from  supply  point  detail  records.  When  a demand  is  placed on the  supply  point  and the  item  is  available,  supply  point  personnel  select  the item  from the  applicable   The following  codes apply  to the MSI transaction  input: location  and  prepare  an  issue  from  detail  (MSI)  transaction. 5.2.3.5.1.1.  Enter  activity  code C (functional  check) or S (supply  point)  in  position 30 and S in  position  53. 5.2.3.5.1.2.  Enter  the  organization  and  shop  code  of  the  requesting  activity  in positions  31-35. 5.2.3.5.1.3.  Enter  the next  sequential  serial  number  in  positions  36-39. 5.2.3.5.1.4.  Enter  the supply  point  item  number  in  positions  40-43. 5.2.3.5.1.5.  Enter  the appropriate  demand  code in  position  44. 5.2.3.5.1.6.  Enter  the  organization  code,  shop  code  (supply  point  number),  and serial  number  of the supply  point  detail  in  positions  72-80. 5.2.3.5.1.7.  Each supply  point  maintains  a locally-devised  serial  number  log,  using numbers  0001 through  9999.  When 9999 has been assigned,  supply  point  personnel start the  log  over with  0001.  The  purpose  of this  log  is  to assign  a sequential  serial number  to the document  number  date field  (positions  36-39) of each issue  from  the supply  point  transaction.   This  technique  permits  multiple  issues  of  a single  item during  one day's processing. 5.2.3.5.1.8.  The  ILS-S  will  return  the  supply  point  output  issue  document  (DD 1348-1A)  to  the  input  terminal  function  if  a  terminal  function  is  availab le  at  the supply  point.   Supply  points  operating  without  a terminal  function  (or  a termina l function  which  is  inoperative)  process issues  from  the supply  point  using  degraded operations  procedures  (TEX  6). 5.2.3.5.1.9.  When  the supply  point  detail  contains  a type authorization  code D, the input  MSI transaction  must  be processed  with  TEX  F (replenishment)  in  position 54.  Note:   When  the  input  MSI stock  number  contains  a dash  two  (-2) and  the replenishment  TEX  code in  position  54 is 4 or V, the  replenishme nt  issue  contains the  dash two stock number.     Note:   Fast Moving  Items.   Use TRN procedures  to record  the  demand  data  instead  of  processing  MSI  for  fast  moving  items  from supply  points.   However,  when  TRN  procedures  are used,  the  supply  point  detail DOLT  is not  updated. 5.2.3.5.2.  Issues from  Mission  Support Kit (MSK) Detail  Records.  Enter the following data: 5.2.3.5.2.1.  Activity  code C, X, or R in  position  30 of the  MSI input  transaction. 340 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.2.3.5.2.2.

Issue  Request  Output  Documents.   Customer  issue  request  output  (DD  1348-1A) documents  normally  print  on  the  applicable  warehouse  terminal  determined  by  the warehouse  location  for the item.   Under the materiel  management  IT processing,  the output issue  document  will  be  printed  on  the  4100  printer  or  hip  printer  unless  the  following exceptions  are present: 5.2.3.7.1.  If  the  item  record  contains  a  blank  warehouse  location,  the  issue  output document  will  be returned  to the input  function. 5.2.3.7.2.  If  the  request  is  issued  from  a supply  point,  MSK, MRSP, WRM, or in-use detail  record, the  output  issue  document  will  be returned  to the input  function. 5.2.3.7.3.  If  the  request  is  for  a satellite  account,  the  output  issue  document  will  be returned  to the input  function. 5.2.3.7.4.  If  the input  TEX  requires,  the DD  1348-1A (output)  issue  document  will  be returned  to the input  function.   See Para  5.2.11 for more  information.   Additionally,  if the  input  delivery  destination  contains  PIK, an I143MGT  notice  (Document  Returned to  Input  Device)  will  be  produced  on  the  warehouse  terminal.    Note:      Degraded operations  issue  requests  do not  produce a DD 1348-1A output  issue  document. 5.2.3.8.  Automatic  Detail  Record  Replenishment.   An  automatic  replenishment  issue occurs each time  an issue  is made from  a Supply  Point,  MSK, WRM spares, or MRSP/IRSP detail  record, unless  automatic  replenishment  is  bypassed  using  TEX  F in  position  54 of the  MSI  input  transaction.   When  stockage  conditions  permit,  multiple  MSI  input  issue transactions  may  be processed on  a given  item  (bypassing  automatic  replenishment),  or a consolidated  replenishment  may  be manually  processed at the close  of the  processing  day.  5.2.4.

If  the request  is  for  unserviceable  items,  enter  F or leave  blank. 344 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 c.  If  the request  is for  items  identified  with  NPPC 4 (TCTO),  enter  D. d.  If  the requested  item  contains  NPPC 9 (unacceptable  for  Air  Force use), enter  J.  Caution:   Supply  condition  code J is  not  authorized  for  issues  to detail  record transactions. 7.  Enter  the type  detail  activity  code as follows: S - Supply  Point M - MSK U - MRSP W - WRM E - WRM/In-Use R - Unserviceable a.  If  the request  is satisfied  from  WRM detail  records, position  53 equals  U, W, or E, and the  end-item  is  MICAP reportable,  use the  applicable  MICAP UJC.  See Para.  5.2.9. for more  information. b.  If  the end-item  is  not MICAP reportable,  use the  appropriate  UJC. 8.  The  applicable  delivery/Supply  response  priority  will  be assigned  to the output  issue document  (DD  1348-1A) based upon  the  assigned  FAD and UJC.  Higher  FAD and UJC combinations  may  be used when  justified. 9.  For bases operating  under  the SBSS/ IMDS CDB interface,  these  fields  are mandatory on all  customer  issue  requests  processed on LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  terminals with  activity  code J.  The  IMDS CDB Unit  ID must  be an alpha  character  or a 001 Reject  is produced.   Enter  the  current  date anywhere  in  blocks  F through  I on the  AF Form  2005. 10.  For organizations  operating  under  the  JOCAS II concept this  field  is  mandatory  on all customer  issue  requests.   The  12 digit  alpha/numeric  JOCAS number  consists  of positions 1-8 (Job Order Number),  and positions  9-12 (Work Breakdown  Structure).   The  JOCAS number  must  be entered  or a 484 Reject  will  be produced. 11.  If  required,  enter  the  requisition  advice  code.  See Para  5.2.45 for  more  information. 12.  If  the activity  code equals  P and the  type  account  code equals  E (equipment),  enter  the applicable  authority  for issue  flag  (Para  5.2.6).  No ILS-S edit  is performed  on authority  for issue  flags  for  ERRCD  NF1 items. 13.  If  position  53 (activity  code of detail)  equals  M, U, or W and the  Asset Status  Flag equals  P for partial  deployment,  enter  D, or leave  blank.   Entering  D will  decrease the deployed  quantity  and no entry  (blank)  will  decrease the  on-hand  quantity. 14.  If  the customer  issue  request  is  from  an organization  with  type organization  code 7, 8, or 9, or the input  UJC is MICAP, enter  the  command  code of the  possessing  command  if unequal  to the  requesting  unit’s  command  code.  Example:   An Air  Combat  Command (ACC) unit  requests  an item  to repair  a piece  of equipment  belonging  to Air  Mobility Command  (AMC).  Enter  command  code 1L (AMC) in  this  field. 15.  If  the issue  request  is  from  a deployed  organization  (positions  4-6 equal  SAM), the  first four  positions  of  this  field  (positions  124-127) must  contain  the  applicable  8000 series requisition  serial  number. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 345 5.2.5.  Common  Coding  Required  For  Issue Inputs. 5.2.5.1.  Common  Issue  Request  Coding.   Once customer  issue  requests  are received  and validated  by the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity,  completion  of the request  involves  a variety  of  coding  to specify:  the  requesting  organization;  priority  of the  request;  end-item or system;  and  specific  processing  requirements  or exception  processing.   The  following paragraphs  explain  some  of  the  common  coding  required  to  complete  customer  issue requests  in  the ILS-S. 5.2.5.1.1.  Force Activity  Designator  (FAD).  The  force  activity  designator  (FAD) is  a one-position  numeric  character  that  may  be entered  on customer  issue  requests.   The FAD signifies  the  relative  order of  importance  of  a supported  organization  requesting supplies  and  equipment  items.   Additionally,  the  ILS-S uses  the  FAD,  in  conjunctio n with  the  Urgency  of  Need  Designator  (UND),  to  determine  the  priority  designator assigned  to  output  requisition  transactions  used  for  customer  backorders.    The  HQ USAF Program  Document  (short  title  PD) is  the authority  for  FAD assignment  for  Air Force organizations,  sections/elements,  activities,  and/or  projects.   See  Para  5.2.7 for more  information  concerning  the assignment  and use  of FAD codes on customer  issue requests. 5.2.5.1.2.  Urgency  of Need Designator  (UND).   The  UND is  used  to express  varying degrees  of  urgency  when  operational  effectiveness  is  impacted  due to non-availabi lit y of requested materiel.   In other words, the UND describes  if  the lack of materiel  causes; mission  impairment,  mission  prevention,  work  stoppage,  work  slow-down,  or  little impact  at all.   The  UND is  expressed  in  the  first  position  of  the  Urgency  Justifica t io n Code (UJC).   Note:   Three  of the  six  UNDs  will  produce  MICAP report  transactions for  backorders.   See Para  5.2.8 for  more  information  concerning  the  assignment  and use of  UNDs on customer  issue  requests. the  UND  for  the  customer  and  the  specific 5.2.5.1.3.  Urgency  Justification  Code (UJC).  The  UJC is  a two-position  combinat io n that  identifies type  of  requireme nt (justification)  or  end-item.    Standard  Air  Force  UJCs  have  been  established  for  all customer the assignment  and use of  the UJC on customer  issue  requests. issue  requests.    See  Para  5.2.9  for  more  information  concerning 5.2.5.1.4.  Demand  Code.  The  demand  code determines  whether  the  requested  items will  be required  by  the  customer  on an  initial,  recurring,  or non-recurring  basis.   This determination  is  very  important  because  the  ILS-S uses  the  results  in  the  creation  and modification  of  demand-based  stock  levels.   The  inappropriate  use  of  demand  codes can result  in  the creation  of excess or insufficient  base stock levels.   For example,  if  the customer  requests  the  same  items  on a recurring  basis,  the  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity  will  store  the  demand  data  and  stock  the  item  for  future  requireme nts accordingly.   Conversely,  if  the  item  is  required  by  the  customer  as  a onetime,  non-recurring  need, the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  would  not  stock the item  since it  may  never  be required  by the  customer  in  the  future.   The  demand  code is  only  one of  many  variables  used in  the  creation  of demand-based  stock levels,  but  is  one of  the most  important.    In  some  cases,  the  demand  code  also  determines  if  due-in-from-maintenance  (DIFM)  detail  establishment  and  control  is  warranted.   See  Para  5.2.10 346 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 for more  information  concerning  the assignment  and use of demand  codes on customer issue  requests. 5.2.5.1.5.  Transaction  Exception  (TEX)  Code.  TEX  codes are used to identify  specific situations  or  exception  processing  required  on  customer  issue  requests.    TEX  codes cover  a  wide  array  of  processing topics  such  as  reimbursement,  automatic replenishment,  requisitioning,  backorders, substitute  item  issues,  fill  or kill  processing, degraded  operations  processing,  and printing  of  output  DD 1348-1A issue  documents.   See Para 5.2.11 for more information  concerning  the assignment  and use of TEX codes on customer  issue  requests. 5.2.5.1.6.  Mark-For  Field.    The  mark-for  field  is  used  for  a  variety  of  purposes  on customer  issue  requests.   Mark-for  requirements  are normally  based  upon  the  type  of maintenance  organization  and/or  the type of item  being  requested.   The mark-for  is also used  to  further  identify  and  specify  end-item  applications.    Examples  of  mark-for requirements  are:   tail  number;  standard  reporting  designator  (SRD);  job order number (JON); individual  name;  warranty  date; work unit  code (WUC); and vehicle  registrat io n number.   See Para 5.2.12  for more information  and processing  instructions  concerning mark-for  requirements  on customer  issue  requests. 5.2.5.2.  ILS-S  Processing  of  Customer  Issue  Requests.    All  customer  issue  requests  are edited  for  completeness  and  correctness  by  the  ILS-S.    Numerous  edits  are  applied including:  available  assets;  master  and  interchangeable  assets;  different  units  of  issue; activity  codes; document  numbers;  etc.  ILS-S processing  edits  are also based upon whether the  assets are warehoused  or located  on detail  records as follows: 5.2.5.2.1.  Issue  of  Stocked Items  in  Warehouse  Locations.   Under  normal  conditions, the ILS-S will  issue  the number  of items  for the requested stock number  to the customer if  assets  are available,  and  no  other  exception  processing  is  required.   However,  there are conditions  where  the  system  will  issue  other  than  requested  assets  when  requested assets  are  not  available,  and  other  acceptable  assets  exist.   If  customer  issue  requests can  be  satisfied  from  stocked  (warehoused) items,  a  customer  issue  request  for expendable  or non-expendable  item  (ISU) transaction  must  be prepared and processed in  the  ILS-S.    See  Para  5.2.13    for  more  information  and  processing  instruct io ns concerning  ILS-S processing  of customer  requests  for  warehoused  assets. 5.2.5.2.2.  Issue  of  Items  Managed  on ILS-S Detail  Records.   In  some  cases, availab le assets may  be managed  on, and issued  from,  ILS-S detail  records such as; MSK, MRSP, IRSP,  or  Supply  Point  detail  records.    When  detail  record  items  are  the  only  assets available  for  issue,  the  item(s),  and  based  upon  the  priority  of  the  customer  request, two results  are possible.   First,  items  may  be turned  into  the LRS/Materiel  Management Activity  for  subsequent  issue  to  the  customer  by  processing  a  turn-in  transaction.   Second, under  certain  conditions,  the ILS-S will  automatically  issue  items  directly  from detail  records.  To manually  issue  items  from  ILS-S detail  records, an issue  from  detail record  transaction  must  be prepared  and  processed  in  the  ILS-S.  See Para  5.2.3  for more  information  concerning  automatic  and manual  issues  from  ILS-S detail  records.  See Para  5.2.4 for  the issue  from  detail  record input  transaction  format  and processing instructions.   Note:      Unless  overrides  are  applied,  issues  to  replenish  detail  record balances  are automatically  processed by the ILS-S.  See AFMAN 23-122, Ch 5. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 347 5.2.5.3.  Customer  Issue  (DD  1348-1A) Output  Document.   When  customer  requests  are satisfied  via  the  issue  of  available  assets  in  the  ILS-S,  whether  from  warehouses,  detail records,  or  for  an  already  established  customer  backorder,  an  output  issue  document  is produced.   The  output  issue  document  (DD  1348-1A)  is  primarily  used  to pull  the  item from  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  stocks, identify  special  processing  requireme nts, obtain  signatures  confirming  customer  receipt,  and  satisfy  audit  trail  requirements.   See Para 5.2.15 for the DD 1348-1A issue  document  output  format.   See Para 5.2.16  for more information  concerning  DD 1348-1A document  flow  and processing  instructions. Issue  Processing  Management  Notices. 5.2.5.4.  Common request processing,  the  ILS-S may  provide  management  notices  to assist  in  the  completion  of  the customer  request.   Common  management  notices  produced  from  issue  processing  include : other  available  assets;  memo  backorder  (due-out)  establishment;  exception  processing requirements;  requisitioning  actions;  and  successful  issue  completion.    See  Para  5.2.17  for  output  formats  and  processing issue  request management  notices. instructions  for  common  customer   During issue 5.2.5.5.  Financial  Error  Correction  for Customer  Issue  Requests.   During  issue  processing in  the ILS-S, it is  possible  for requesting  organization  financial  accounts  to be overcharged or undercharged.   This  normally  occurs  when  item  costs  have  been  erroneously  assigned or changed  on ILS-S item  records.   Customers  should  check the  Daily  Document  Register (D04) and PFMR/OCCR Update and Reconciliation  Listing  (D11) daily  to detect financ ia l errors.  See AFH 23-122, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for  additional  details  concerning  D04 and D11 reports.  When financial  errors are discovered,  and the customer  is not at fault,  the customer may  request  record  reversal  action  to  correct  the  error.   After  record  reversal  processing has  occurred,  the  item  will  be re-issued  to the  customer  with  the  correct  price.   See AFH 23-122,  Vol  2,  Pt  2, Ch  5  for  more  information  concerning  record  reversal  transaction processing.   Note:    Record  reversal  is  limited  to  financial  errors  detected  in  the  current fiscal  year. 5.2.5.6.  Customer  Issue  Request  Exception  Processing.    There  are  items  and  situatio ns where  special  materiel  handling  or management  attention  is required  to successfully  fulfil l customer  issue  requests.   The  ILS-S uses issue  exception  (IEX)  codes to:   identify  special conditions  required;  control  the issue  of certain  items;  ensure  limited  stocks are used to the best advantage;  retain  certain  items  required  for stand-by  specific  positions;  and  to advise when  additional  processing  must  be accomplished.   See Para  5.2.14 for  a list  of  approved issue  exception  codes and processing  instructions. 5.2.6.  Authority  For  Issue Flag. 5.2.6.1.  Purpose.   To identify  and  describe  the  one-position  authority  for  issue  flag.   The authority  for  issue  flag  must be  entered  on  customer  issue  requests  for  non-accountable (activity  code P) equipment  items,  unless  the  ERRCD  equals  NF1. 5.2.6.2.

Force Activity  Designator (FAD). 5.2.7.1.  Purpose.    To  explain  the  Force  Activity  Designator  (FAD)  on  customer  issue requests.   The  FAD  is  also  used  in  combination  with  the  UND  to determine  the  priority designator  to be assigned  on  requisition  (A0(*))  transactions.   See  Para  5.2.90 for  more information. 5.2.7.2.  FAD Authority  and Assignment  Rules.   The  HQ USAF Program  Document  (PD) is  the authority  for  the assignment  of FAD codes for  initial  and future  requirements  of Air Force sections/elements,  activities,  and projects.   See AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch  8 for more  information  concerning  FAD code load, change,  and delete  on organization  records. 5.2.7.2.1.  FAD Override  Option.   If the requesting  organization  is an Air  Force activit y and  the  requested  item  will  be used  in  direct  support  of  an  organization  containing  a higher  FAD,  the  FAD  of  the  organization  being  supported  should  be  used.    This  is called  the “FAD  override”  option.   Note:   The  FAD override  option  should  be used as sparingly  as  possible,  since  the  higher  FAD  equates  to  a higher  requisition  priority  if the  request  must  be backordered.   Therefore,  FAD  overrides  should  only  be used  for special  emphasis  programs the  HQ  USAF  PD  and  not  for  routine administrative  support. listed in AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 349 5.2.7.2.2.  When  supported  organizations  containing  a higher  FAD  are  not  supported by  the  requesting  organization  on  a predominant,  continuing  basis,  the  FAD  override option  should  only  be used  on a case by case customer  request  basis. 5.2.7.2.3.  When  supported  organizations  containing  a higher  FAD  are supported  on a routine,  continuing  basis,  but  not  predominantly,  a separate  organizational  cost center record  (OCCR)  should  be  established  for  the  supported  organization  containing  the higher  FAD. 5.2.7.2.4.  When  supported  organizations  containing  a higher  FAD  are predominant ly supported  on  a continuing  basis,  the  higher  FAD  will  be loaded  to the  existing  OCCR of the  requesting  organization. 5.2.7.2.5.  If  the FAD is  blank  on the  customer  issue  request,  the ILS-S will  assign  the FAD from  the  applicable  organization  (518) record. 5.2.8.  Urgency  of Need Designator (UND) 5.2.8.1.  Purpose.    To  explain  the  one-position  alpha/numeric  character  used  to  express varying  degrees  of  urgency  on  customer  issue  requests.    The  UND  is  used  to  express situations  when  operational  effectiveness  is  jeopardized  due  to materiel  non-availabilit y.   Additionally, requisitioning  programs  to determine  requisition  priority. the  UND  is  also  used,  in  conjunction  with  the  FAD  code,  by  ILS-S 5.2.8.2.  UND Assignment  Rules.   The UND is contained  in  the first  position  of the urgency justification  code  (UJC).    See  Para  5.2.9  for  applicable  UJCs.    For  a  more  detailed discussion  of existing  UNDs, see DoD 4140.1-R. 5.2.8.3.  UND  Assignment  and  Usage.    Assign  the  UND  to  customer  issue  requests  as described  in  Table 5.8. Table 5.8.  UND Assignment  and  Usage. UND A Assignment  and  Usage Use UND A on customer  issue  requests  and backorders  when  continued materiel  non-availability  prevents  an Air  Force organization/activity  from performing  its  combat/support  missions  or tasks, or training  for  such  missions or tasks.  The  commanding  officer  of  the supported  organization  will  be responsible  for  ensuring  the urgency  of the  requirement  is  commensurate  with assigned  mission  objectives.   Requests  for items  supporting  MICAP reportable weapon  systems  or end-items  will  be backordered as MICAP (UND 1, J, /) or as a delayed  discrepancy  (UJC BQ), except  time  change/TCTO  requirements.   Additionally,  UJC AA,  AZ, and AW will  not be used for  backorders against aircraft  tail  numbers  or end-items  containing  a MICAP reportable  SRD.  See Para.  5.2.23. for  more information  concerning  MICAP customer  backorders.  If UND A is  assigned,  be prepared to justify  its  usage. 1 Use UND 1 on customer  backorders when  lack  of the  requested  item  prevents primary  mission  accomplishment  because  the  end-item  is not  operationally 350 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 ready,  out-of-commission,  or inoperative.   Backorders  containing  UND 1 will produce  a MICAP report  with  MICAP condition  codes E, G, K, P, U, V, or W if  the requested  item  contains  a MICAP-reportable  SRD.  The  ILS-S converts UND 1 to UND A for  determining  the  appropriate  requisition  priority  on customer  backorders.  If  UND 1 is  assigned,  be prepared to justify  its  usage. J Use UND J on customer  backorders when  lack  of the  requested  item  impairs primary  mission  accomplishment  because  the  end-item  is not  fully  equipped  or is  operating  in  a limited  or restricted  capacity.   Backorders  containing  UND J will  produce a MICAP report  with  MICAP condition  codes F, L, or R if  the requested  item  contains  a MICAP-reportable  SRD.  The  ILS-S converts  UND J to UND A for determining  the appropriate  requisition  priority  on customer backorders.  If  UND J is assigned,  be prepared to justify  its  usage. / (Slash)  Use UND / (Slash)  on customer  backorders when  the  requested  item  is  required to satisfy  a MICAP requirement  caused  by battle  damage.   Backorders containing  UND / will  produce a MICAP report with  MICAP condition  code M if  the requested  item  contains  a MICAP-reportable  SRD.  The  ILS-S converts UND / to UND A for determining  the requisition  priority  on customer backorders.  Note:   UND / is only  authorized  when  the  MICAP condition  was caused  by hostile  actions.   If UND / is  assigned,  be prepared to justify  its  usage. B Use UND B on customer  issue  requests  and  backorders when  lack  of the requested  item  impairs  an Air  Force organization/activity  from  performing assigned  combat/support  mission  or tasks.  Additionally,  use UND B when training  for such  missions  and tasks can be accomplished,  but  with  decreased effectiveness  and efficiency.   To determine  effectiveness  and efficiency, consider  alternatives  such  as feasible  work-arounds,  emergency  procedures, controlled  cannibalization,  equipment  redundancy,  modification  of equipment, use of  substitute  items,  etc.  Note:   UND B may  also be assigned  when  an organization/activity  anticipates  that  materiel  deficiencies  will  prevent performance  of assigned  missions  or tasks, if  materiel  is  not available  during the  following  time  frames:  Organizations  assigned  FAD I, II, or III:  CONUS:  Days  8-11 (inclusive)  OCONUS:  Day  13-16 or day 18-21 (inclusive)  (depending  on geographical area)  Organizations  assigned  FAD IV or V:  AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 351 CONUS:  Day 12-24 (inclusive)  OCONUS:  Day  17-52 or day 22-92 (inclusive)  (depending  on geographical area) C Use UND C on customer  issue  requests  and  backorders when  another  UND does not  qualify  for  assignment.   Use UND C on customer  issue  requests  and backorders for  stock replenishment  actions,  initial  lay-ins,  etc. 5.2.9.  Urgency  Justification  Code (UJC). 5.2.9.1.  Purpose.    To  explain  the  two-position  alpha/numeric  urgency  justification  code (UJC)  assigned  to  customer  issue  requests.   The  UJC  combines  the  customer  urgency  of need (UND)  and type of  requirement  (justification)  as described  below. 5.2.9.2.  MICAP  UJC  Assignment  Rules.    When  MICAP  customer  issue  requests  are verified  for  backorder,  the  first  position  of  the  UJC  (UND)  will  be  replaced  with  the applicable  MICAP UND (1, J, or /).  Once replaced,  the  ILS-S will  create a MICAP report (B9M)  transaction  with  a corresponding  MICAP condition  code as listed  below. 5.2.9.3.  MICAP  Required  Delivery  Date  (RDD)  Assignment  Rules.    Assign  MICAP required  delivery  dates as defined  in  Table  5.10. 5.2.9.4.  UJC Assignment  and Usage.   Assign  UJCs as described  in  Table  5.9. Table 5.9.  UJC Assignment  and  Usage.

If  an overriding  operational  situation  justifies  immediate  supply  support,  the  using MAJCOM may  authorize  the use  of UND B. 3.  UJC AV  and BV are assigned  when  circumstances  such  as unit  activation,  deployments,  etc., dictate  the use  of priority  requisitioning  to obtain  equipment,  and when  the lack  of requested  items would  prevent  or impair  the  accomplishment  of the  unit's  mission. 4.  Assign  FAD  3 for DC conditions.   When  backordered, UJC AZ creates  a priority  03 requisition and UJC BZ creates a priority  06 requisition.  Table 5.10.  MICAP RDD Assignment  and  Usage.

CONUS activities  scheduled  for  overseas  deployment  are authorized  to enter  999 in positions  62-64 of  MICAP requisitions.   Process the customer  issue  request  with  the appropriate  MICAP UJC in  positions  65-66, 999 in  positions  62-64, and TEX  7 in  position  51.  The  requisition  will  be prepared offline. 358 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 2.  The  RDD  on MICAP requisitions  (positions  62-64) and due-in  detail  records for CONUS bases will  contain  NA in  the  first  two positions  followed  by the  last  position  of the  UJC.  For example:   NAA identifies  a 1A UJC.  When  the  source  of supply  is other  than  an Air  Force depot, the first  position  will  contain  an N followed  by two zeros. 3.  For OCONUS bases, the RDD  on due-in  detail  records and MICAP requisitions  will contain  the  same  information  as CONUS bases. 5.2.10.  Demand  Code. 5.2.10.1.  Purpose.   To  explain  the  one-position  demand  code assigned  to  customer  issue requests.   Demand  codes determine  if  customer  demands  will  be captured  and recorded in the  ILS-S for  computing  demand-based  stock levels.   The  demand  code also  determines, under  certain  situations,  whether  DIFM control  will  be established. Table 5.11.  Supply  Demand  Code Usage. Demand Code Type Request I, J, K, L, M INITIAL Remarks See Notes 1, 2, and 5 for  additional information.   See Note 6 for examples. For  Supplies Description/Effect Description:  A request to  satisfy original shortage/installation or later losses to original installed items.  No turn-in of an unserviceable item is involved.  Effect:  Initial requests are not considered as demands against the LRS/Materiel Management Activity; consequently, demand data are not updated on the item record  and DIFM control is not established. C CONTRACTOR  Description:   A request  from  a  R, T RECURRING contractor  for  items  required  in  support of authorized  contracts.   This  code is used only  when  it  is  anticipated  that  a like  item  will  not  be returned.   Effect:   Contractor  support  issues  will  not update  the item  record demand  data and DIFM control  is  not  established. Description:   A request  to replace  a like item  that  is  suspected  to be, or is unserviceable  or condemned.   Used for items  commonly  required  in  day-to-day See Note 3 for restrictions.     See Note 7 for operations  which  may  be requested  in the  future.   Effect:   Recurring  demand examples. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 359 N, U NON-RECURRING codes will  update  the  item  record date of first  demand  (if  blank),  date of  last demand,  number  of demands, cumulative  recurring  demands,  and establish  DIFM control.   These  demand codes also  update  repair  cycle record/repair  cycle  data when  the removed  item  is  returned  from maintenance  shops. Description:   A request  for  a requirement  known  to be a one-time occurrence--for  example,  an MWO kit for  application  or an initial  request  for stockage.   Requisitions  will  be coded non-recurring  when  the demand  is anticipated  to be non-repetitive.   Effect:   Nonrecurring  demands  are not considered  as demands  against LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity; consequently,  demand  data are not updated  on the item  record.  This demand  code will  establish  DIFM control,  but  it  will  not update  repair cycle  data on the  repair  cycle  record.  These  demand  codes will  be used  on all issues  to supply  point,  MSK, and MRSP details. See Note 3 for restrictions.     See Note 4 for nonrecurring demands.     See Note 8 for examples. Table 5.12.  Equipment  Demand Code Usage. Demand Code Description For  Equipment Use With  Advice Code Example I R N Initial  Shortage 6H or 6J 6F or 6G 6F or 6E Replacement Replacement  of Loss to Air  Force Equipment Management System   Initial  issues  to BCE real  property, training  devices,  bench  mockups;  all issues  to other  governmental  agencies; replacement  for  loss  reported on relief  of accountability  documents  (for  example, 360 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 DD 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Properly Loss, IAD,  etc.). Notes: 1.  The  following  information  applies: a.  If  it  is determined  to phase out  items  in  stock due to lack  of use  or end-item  phase-down,  assign demand  code N to all  issue  requests. b.  If  munitions  (CAD/PAD)  items  are requested,  assign  demand  code N. 2.  Assign  the  demand  code as follows: I - Initial  Issue J - Initial  Issue--Training  Aids. K - Initial  Issue--Special  Projects. L - Initial  Issue--Assembly/Disassembly. M - Initial  Issue--Mockup/Test  Stand. N - Initial  Issue--All  other. 3.  Demand  code T and U are restricted  to ICBM maintenance  organizations. 4.  The  following  information  applies: a.  If  the customer  issue  request  is  ultimately  backordered, and the  ILS-S produces  a requisition (A0(*))  transaction,  the  issue  request  demand  code is  converted  to the  requisition  demand  code. See Para  5.2.10 for  more information. b.  If  the request  is  for  inactivated  items,  demand  code I is  assigned.   This  demand  code will  be entered  only  in  requisition  (A0(*))  transactions  applicable  to inactivated  items  by the  DLA Transaction  Service  (DLATS).   See DLM 4000.25-1-M. c.  If  the request  is for  equipment,  assign  the demand  code as depicted  in  Table 5.12. 5.  If  demand  code I is  used on an issue  request  to replenish  a supportable  MRSP detail  record, any quantity  available  above the  requisitioning  objective  will  be issued.   Any  remaining  unfilled quantities  will  be backordered.  If  the  issue  request  is  to replenish  unsupportable  MRSP detail records, the  requirement  is  always  backordered. 6.  Examples  of initial  requests  are:   requirements  for  initial  shortages;  items  to be installed  in  bench test sets/mockups;  items  lost  in  flight,  fire,  or crash;  TCTO kits;  and bits  and pieces  to build  TCTO kits.   The  establishment  or increases  to authorized  quantities  for  WRM, MRSP, and IRSP detail records are also included  in  initial  requirements. 7.  Recurring  requests  include  issues  for  normal  day-to-day operations  including  maintenance,  time change  requirements,  and equipment  items  for  which  replacement  is  anticipated.   Recurring  requests are used for  any  item  for  which  a continuing  requirement  is  expected to exist.   Recurring  requests may  also be used  for regularly  scheduled  transient  flights. 8.  Non-recurring  requests  include  items  issued  to perform  modification,  replacement  items  in  kits with  a newer  item  (retrofit),  and requests  for non-regularly  scheduled  transient  aircraft  support  when the  item  requested  is  not common  to the  system  supported  by the  base.  5.2.11.  Transaction  Exception  (TEX)  Code. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 361 5.2.11.1.  Purpose.   To describe  the  TEX  code  and  the  effect  each  code has  on  customer issue  requests.   Dual  TEX  code usage  combines  two or more  TEX  code functionalities  as described below.   Note:   Use of the dual  TEX codes has the same effect  on issue  transaction processing  as the normal  TEX  code, except  that  the DD  1348-1A (output  issue  document) will  be printed  on the  input  terminal. 5.2.11.2.  Funds  Availability  Edits.   Funds  availability  edits  are not performed  by the  ILS-S when  the:  item’s  budget  code is other than  8 or 9; backordered assets are stored on Supply secondary  or  detail  records;  TEX  on  the  issue  request  equals  D  (free)  or  6 (done  using degraded  operations  procedures);  supported  organization  code equals  002, 004, 005, 010; routing  identifier  code (RIC) equals HR1 or JBR; urgency  of need designator  (UND) equals 1 (except 1T), J, or / (slash)  (MICAP).  Note:   If sufficient  funds  are not available  to cover the  total  cost  of  the  backorder,  a 907 reject  is  produced.   See  DFAS-DE  7077.10-M for more  information  and  correction  procedures.    For financial  error  correction  on  customer issue  requests,  refer  to Para  5.2.1.4.5. 5.2.11.3.  TEX  D  or R  Usage.    To establish  a customer  backorder  with  no  charge  for  an AFMC-managed  (budget  code 8 only)  item,  process the  customer  issue  request  with  TEX D or R.  If the budget  code is other  than  8, a 279 reject is  produced.  Note:   The  279 reject is  not  produced  for  laundry  and  dry  cleaning  equipment  if  allowance  source  code (ASC) 534 is  used in  the  input  project code field.   The  use of  TEX  D or R  is  restricted  and must be  used  according  to  Air  Force  policy  instructions.   The  SMAG  Manager  at  each  base determines  validity  of TEX  D or R customer  requirements.   When  free  issuing  any  budget code 8 items  the SMAG  manager  must  notify  HQ AFMC/A4YF  for  approval. 5.2.11.4.  TEX  Codes and Explanations. Table 5.13.  TEX  Codes and  Explanations. TEX B Dual TEX S C NA Description And Processing Effect REIMBURSEMENT  REQUIRED.   This  TEX  code is used  as determined  locally  and/or by the  MAJCOM to identify  those  issue requests  by non-tenant  organizations  that  require  reimbursement.  (See Note 2) SUBSTITUTE  ISSUE.   This  TEX  code is  used to issue  a different (substitute)  NSN to a detail  record such  as MRSP, IRSP, WRM, and Supply  Point. D R REIMBURSEMENT  NOT REQUIRED.   This  TEX  code is used  as determined  locally  to identify  those  issue  requests  that  do not  require reimbursement;  i.e.,  redistribution  of  excesses,  etc.  In  other  words, this TEX  code is  used for  the  free issue  and  free backorder/DOR  of selected items.   The  use of TEX  D pertains  to activity  code X, R, J, and D issue requests  only.   Do not  use TEX  D without  the  approval  of  the SMAG Manager.   The  SMAG Manager  is  responsible  for the  complete  review  of TEX  D issues  and due-outs.   For AFMC-managed  (budget  code 8) items, 362 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 the  Funds  Manager  must  receive  a list  of selected  items  identified  as non-reimbursable  from  an appropriate  higher  authority;  i.e., MAJCOM, PM, or the  Air  Staff  and ensure  HQ AFMC/A4YF  is  provided  the list.   Using a TEX  D to create a “free”  due-out  for budget  code 8 items  allows  for  the requisition  to be automatically  created.  To ensure  that  only  approved items  are processed with  TEX  D, the  Funds  Manager  will  review  the Base Supply  Surveillance  Report  (D20), Part One, Free Issue  and Credit Code Y Turn-ins.   If  there  are free  issue  transactions  appearing  on the D20 that  were not authorized,  each free  issue  transaction  will  be record reversal  and reprocessed without  TEX  code D. NO END-ITEM  DOCUMENT  NUMBER  ON AWP REQUEST.   Normal  mark-for  field  edits  apply. ISSUE FROM DETAIL  WITHOUT  REPLENISHMENT.   Do not replenish  the supply  point,  MSK, WRM, or MRSP detail. DO NOT REQUISITION.   Suppress  other  asset notice  (Processing  will be the  same  as TEX  code 7.) DO NOT ISSUE,  DO NOT REQUISITION,  ESTABLISH  DUE-OUT.   Due-out  will  be established,  assets will  not be issued,  and  requisition action  will  not be taken.  The  due-out  will  be un-obligated  until requisitioned  from  other  than  a free  source  of supply.   This  code is restricted  to DLADS  withdrawals,  chemical  warfare  gear,  unfunded mobility  supplies  and equipment,  and  CEERS L and P equipment brochure  items. BYPASS  REJECT  488.  This  TEX  code will  bypass  reject 488 for  a UND C request  when  a shipment  suspense  detail  is on file  for serviceable assets previously  transferred  to DLADS.    Bypass  CMOS ICI when  processing  to preclude  creation  of  shipment suspense  record and to produce  a DCR. ISSUE FROM SUPPLY POINT DETAIL.   This  code applies  only  to supply  point  details  for  type  account  code K, type  authorization  codes C, I, P, S, T, or Z, non-additive  details.   Processing  is  the same  as  TEX  code F, except  that  the ILS-S will  automatically  interface  with  the  FSP transaction  program  to reduce  the authorized  quantity  on the  supply  point detail  by the quantity  in  the  issue  (MSI) transaction. REINPUT  OF KILLED  ISSUE REQUEST.   When  used,  a customer backorder and subsequent  requisitioning  action  can  take place  or an issue from  an IRSP/RSP  detail  if  it  passes the  issue  edits  and there  are assets available  in  the  kits.   E F G H I J L NA NA NA NA NA ISU NA M NA O NA Internally  assigned  by DIT/ISU  program  for JCS/OSD requirements within  project code 9(xx). AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 363 Q R ISU R NA ISU Bypass  CMOS ICI when  using  degraded  operations  procedures  to preclude  creation  of shipment  suspense  record and  to produce  a DCR. Combination  D and 7.  Free Issue,  memo  due-out.   This  applies  to budget code 8 items  only.   Do not use  this  code without  the  approval  of the Supply  Management  Activity  Group  (SMAG)  manager  who  must  get approval  from  HQ AFMC/A4YF.   Using  a TEX  R creates  a “free”  due-out for  budget  code 8 items  without  creating  a requisition. ISSUE FROM SUPPLY POINT DETAIL.   This  code applies  only  to supply  point  details  for  type  account  code K, type  authorization  codes C, I, P, S, T, or Z, non-additive  details.   Processing  is  the same  as a blank TEX  code, except  that  the  ILS-S will  automatically  interface  with  the FSP program  to reduce  the  authorized  quantity  on the supply  point  detail by the  quantity  in  the  MSI. T NA ISSUE REQUESTED  STOCK NUMBER  ONLY.  When  used, the ILS-S bypasses  the ISG group  and only  the  requested  stock number  requested will  be issued  or backordered.  When  the customer  issue  request  input results  in  a backorder (due-out)  of an item  that  contains  a relationship code of  M or I, an  F017 MGT  notice  (Item  Requested  Not Fully Interchangeable)  will  be produced.  See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for  processing  instructions. DO NOT ISSUE.   Establish  customer  backorder (due-out)  for unsupportable  code MRSP/IRSP  requirements  only. Degraded  Operations.   Same  as TEX  code 6, with  the  exception  that  the ILS-S-generated  requisition  date (at time  of  processing  instead  of  the document  number  date) is  assigned  to the  ISU/DOR  field  on the  DIFM detail.   TEX  code W is  applicable  only  to MSI input  transactions. SHIP TO SUPPLEMENTARY  ADDRESS.   When  TEX  X is  used in support  of project  COOL BARGE  (175) or PACER GOOSE (Y31), the project code must  be 175 or Y31 if  automatic  due-out  and requisitioning are required.   For other  uses  when  TEX  X is  contained  in  the  due-out detail,  the requisitioning  programs  will  place  the  first  six  positions  of the organization  title  in  the  supplementary  address of  the due-in  detail  and requisition. COMBINATION TEX  E, 5, AND 7.  Do not requisition.   Disregard  edits for  end-item  document  number  and reasonable  quantity. DO NOT ISSUE,  DO NOT REQUISITION,  ESTABLISH  MEMO DUE-OUT.   This  code will  be used to establish  an obligated  memo  due-out.  On-hand  quantities  will  be issued/released  only  when  the specified due-in  linked  to the  due-out  is  received.   Note:   When  an off-base supply  point  issue  request  is  processed and the type  authorization  on the U NA W NA X NA Y Z NA NA 364 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 1 2 3 4 NA K NA V 6 NA 7 P supply  point  detail  record equals  D, TEX  Z will  establish  a linked  due-in detail  record and  direct  shipment  to an off-base  supply  point. DO NOT REQUISITION  OR AUTOMATICALLY  RELEASE  DUE-OUT.  Same as TEX  7.  In addition,  the due-out  release  programs  will not automatically  release  due-outs. DISREGARD  AUTHORIZED  VS ON-HAND QUANTITY  EDITS  ON ISSUE TO SUPPLY POINT, MSK, WRM, OR MRSP.  (See Note 2)   BYPASS  FUNDS AVAILABILITY  ON THIS  REQUEST.   Do not  use this  TEX  code without  prior  approval  of the budget  officer.   See  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7  for  reject  907. FILL  OR KILL.  Used on priority  issue  requests  for  any  quantity  not filled.   Demand  data are not  updated for  the  killed  portion  of  the issue request.   Activity  codes C and L are not  authorized  to use this  code.  (See Note 2) Degraded  Operations.   For the input  stock number  and system designator,  the total  balance  must  be sufficient  to process the input quantity,  or the request  will  produce  a 290 reject.   Reject  290 will  freeze the  item  records of the  input  stock number  and system  designator  with freeze  code I.  Transactions  done  using  degraded  operations  procedures should  be held  to an absolute  minimum  since  they  increase  the  possibility of errors  and warehouse  refusals. DO NOT REQUISITION.   If  the  request  cannot  be filled  and  results  in  a due-out,  the due-out  will  be memo  and  requisitioning  action  will  not  be taken.   The  ILS-S will  bypass authorized  quantity  edits  when  used  on issue  to WRM or MRSP details.  (See Note 2) 8 NA DO NOT ISSUE.   Establish  a due-out  and disregard  reasonable  quantity edit.   If  type account  code is  B, a firm  obligated  due-out  will  be established  and requisitioning  action  taken.   If  type account  code is  E and the  item  record budget  code is Z or 9, a memo  unobligated  due-out  will be established.   No requisitioning  action  will  be taken.   If type  account code is  E and the item  record budget  code is  alpha  (except  Z), this  TEX code will  be disregarded  by the issue  program.    % NA REDUCED  PRICE ISSUE.  At the  option  of the  LRS CC/AO, items with  MIC 3, 4, or blank  and ERRC  XB3 or NF1 (with  IEX  E/6 or 3/K) may  be offered  for  sale at a reduced  price  (in  lieu  of transfer  to disposal) after  365 days  in  retention.   ERRC  XB3 or ERRC  NF1 (with  IEX  E/6 or 3/K) items  with  MIC 1 or 2 assigned  may  be sold  at a reduced  price  after 700 days in  retention  (i.e.,  30 days before  the full  retention  period is met).   Budget  codes 1 and 9 are the only  budget  codes allowed.   The percentage  discount  (from  01 up to a maximum  of 99 percent  off)  is  also AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 365 a LRS CC/AO option.   Only  items  on hand  will  be discounted  and backordering  at a reduced  price  is not  allowed.   To ensure  only  items approved  by the LRS CC/AO are issued,  the  Funds  Manager  should review  the Base Supply  Surveillance  Report (D20), part 11, Reduced Price  Issues.   Issue  inputs  not  meeting  the  above conditions  will  produce a non-cumulative  001 reject.  See  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7  for corrective  action. PRINT OUTPUT  DOCUMENT  ON INPUT FUNCTION.  May  be used on UND A or B ISU inputs  to bypass assignment  of  TEX  code 4 when original  input  resulted  in  a 295 reject.

If  the requested  items  are used on aircraft,  enter  the  aircraft  two position  year and five-position serial  number/equipment  identification  (tail  number)  code.  For other  than  aircraft  requests  enter the  last  seven  positions  of the  serial  number. b.  If  a serial  number  or tail  number  is  not available,  and the  maintenance  activity  is supported  by IMDS CDB, enter  the  locally  constructed  four-digit  IMDS CDB equipment  identification  code in positions  70-73. c.  If  the locally  constructed  four-digit  IMDS CDB equipment  identification  code is  used in positions  70-73, and the  year of  manufacture  is not  known,  positions  67-69 may  be non-significant numeric  characters  in  this  field. d.  If  the maintenance  activity  is  not supported  by IMDS CDB, and no serial  number  or tail  number exists,  use  non-significant  numeric  characters  in  this  field. e.  If  the requested  items  are for  communications-electronics  (CE) activities  supported  by IMDS CDB and a serial  number  exists,  enter  zeros  in  positions  67-68 (instead  of  the equipment  serial number)  and the  locally  constructed  five-digit  IMDS CDB equipment  identification  in  positions  69-73. f.  If  the  requested  items  are SPRAM (activity  code D with  a blank  mark-for),  the ILS-S automatically  assigns  the  major  command  code, SRD of ZZZ,  and  work unit  code ZZ.  See Para 5.2.22.2 for  additional  information  about  SPRAM item  issues.  5.2.13.  ILS-S Edit  Of Customer  Issue Requests. 5.2.13.1.  Purpose.  To explain  internal  ILS-S processing  of the different  types  of customer issue  requests. 5.2.13.2.  General  Updates.  Recurring  customer  issue  requests  are designed  to update ILS-S demand  data.  Additionally,  the ILS-S updates  applicable  item  and detail  record balances as appropriate  upon  issue  of stock.  If  required,  the  ILS-S creates  substitute  detail  records for  equipment  item  issues.   Any  time  activity  code E, J, M, P, R, S, U, W, or X customer issue  requests  are killed,  the  ILS-S provides  an I023 MGT notice.   See  AFH  23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7  for  more  information. 5.2.13.3.  ILS-S Edits.   All  customer  issue  (ISU)  input  transactions  are edited  by the  ILS-S with  the exceptions  listed  below.   Any  error  in  the  issue  transaction  input  that  cannot  be corrected  by  the  ILS-S will  be rejected  (AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt  2, Ch  7).   Line  1 of  the reject  output  document  will  be  identical  to  line  1 of  the  input  image  with  the  following exceptions: AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 369 5.2.13.3.1.  Materiel  Management  Aggregation  Code (MMAC).  If the MMAC is blank on  the  input  issue  transaction,  the  ILS-S will  assign  the  MMAC  loaded  on  the  item record. 5.2.13.3.2.  Urgency  Justification  Code (UJC).  If the input  UJC is AR or BR,  the ILS-S will  automatically  assign  the  AWP delivery  destination  from  the  organization  (518) record, regardless  of  the  input  entry.   If  the  delivery  destination  is  blank  and the  input UJC  is  not  AR  or BR,  the  delivery  destination  from  the  organization  (518)  record  is assigned  on the issue  output  document  or due-out detail  (backorder) record.  If the input issue  transaction  contains  a blank  UJC, the ILS-S assigns  UJC CZ.  See Para 5.2.9. for more  information. 5.2.13.3.3.  Customer  Issue  Request  Priorities.   Customer  issue  request  processing  by LRS/Materiel  Management  Activities  depends  a  great  deal  upon  the  priority  of  the request.   Priority  handling  requirements  may  be locally  established  at the  option  of  the commander  of the delivery  function.   However,  priority  handling  is not required  unless needed  to  meet  maximum  delivery times.    Customer  Service  or  other  applicable LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel  involved  with  receiving  customer  issue requests  may  question  requested  delivery  priorities  which  appear to contain  an inflated UJC/UND.  Note:   While  priority  challenges  may  reduce the number  of violations  that can  occur  in  the  Air  Force ILS-S  and  reduce  total  costs,  the  customer  bears  ultimate authority  and responsibility  for  the UJC/UND  used on requests. 5.2.13.3.4.  Fill  or  Kill  Customer  Issue  Requests.    Many  priority  customer  issue requests  are processed in  the ILS-S as “Fill  or Kill”  when  the  input  TEX  code is  blank.   If  the  following  conditions  are  met,  the  ILS-S  automatically  processes  the  customer issue  request  as fill  or kill  (TEX  4): 5.2.13.3.4.1.  Customer  issue  requests  with  urgency  of need designator  (UND) A. 5.2.13.3.4.2.  Customer  issue  requests  with  urgency  justification  code (UJC)  BR, BO, or BQ. 5.2.13.3.4.3.  Customer  issue  requests  with  UND C for  items  containing  NPPC 2 or 5.  Note:   When  an input  issue  request  is killed,  take action  as outlined  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 8. the  ILS-S  performs 5.2.13.3.5.  AWP Customer  Issue  Requests.   If  the  customer  issue  request  is  to satisfy AWP  requirements, the  following  edits  on  the  input  ISU transaction:    the  UJC  in  positions  65-66 must  equal  AR  or  BR,  and  positions  67-80 must  contain  the  end-item  document  number  in  the  mark-for  field.   See Para  5.2.12. for  the  correct  mark-for  usage.    Additionally,  positions  94-95 must  contain  the  end-item  system  designator  (TEX  code not  equal  to E  or Y),  and  positions  118-120 must contain  the  end-item  standard  reporting  designator  (SRD).  Note:   If  the ILS-S cannot locate  the  end-item  document  number  or  system  designator,  the  input  is  rejected.  Establish  a  memo  (TEX  7)  backorder  (due-out)  for  the  repair  cycle  (ERRCD XD(*)/XF(*))  AWP end-item  when  maintenance  elects  to order bits and pieces (instead of  the  end-item)  for  repair.    For  this  low  priority-type  requirement,  assign  urgency justification  code (UJC) CZ.  Processing  in this  manner  provides  visibility  through  ILS-S DIFM and AWP reports, while  excluding  the requirement  from  priority  manageme nt.   370 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 If the  issue  transaction  contains  TEX  E, normal  issue  (ISU) transaction  formats  cannot be used.  Additionally,  if  the quantity  requested  is  greater  than  one (1) for the end-item document  number  identified  in  positions  67-80, or  multiple  DIFM  details  exist,  the ILS-S will  process  the  input  issue  (ISU)  transaction  as fill  or kill.    Note:   Customer backorders (due-out)  cannot  be established  against  multiple  DIFM detail  quantities  due to automated  AWP status  update  techniques. 5.2.13.3.6.  Equipment  Item  Customer  Issue  Requests.   The  following  action  is  taken by the  ILS-S for customer  issue  requests  for equipment  items: for  issue  flag. 5.2.13.3.6.1.  Authority   If  the  customer  request  is  for  non-accountable  equipment  (activity  code is P), enter the appropriate  authority  for issue flag  in  position  115 of  the  input  issue  (ISU)  transaction  (Para  5.2.6).  Note:   No ILS-S edits  are performed  for requested  equipment  items  containing  ERRCD  NF1. 5.2.13.3.6.2.  Interchangeable  equipment  issues  for  equipment  management  code (EMC)  1 items.   If  the  input  authority  for  issue  flag  is  Z, and  requested  assets  are not  available, the  ILS-S  will  attempt  to  issue  interchangeable  assets  if  the interchangeable  asset(s)  contains  equipment  management  code  (EMC)  1.  Otherwise,  the ILS-S will  “kill”  the request  and produce an I023 (other  asset) MGT notice.   See  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7  for  more  information  and  processing instructions. 5.2.13.3.6.3.  Equipment  items  containing  NPPC  9.    If  the  requested  equipment item  contains  NPPC 9 (unacceptable  for  Air  Force use),  the  ILS-S will  change  the input  TEX  code  to  4 (fill  or  kill)  and  continue  processing  unless  TEX  code  6  is used. 5.2.13.3.6.4.  Equipment  part numbered  items.   If position  8 of the equipment  issue request  contains  a  P  (part  number),  the  ILS-S  will  attempt  to  convert  the  part number  to a stock number.   If  the  part number  cannot  be converted,  an I007  MGT notice  (Part  Number  Request  Requires  External  Review)  will  be produced.   See  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7  for  more  information  and processing  instructions. 5.2.13.3.7.  Other  than  Requested  NSN.  If  other  than  the  requested  item  was  issued (for  example,  master,  interchangeable,  or substitute  with  a different  unit  of  issue),  the stock number  on the output  will  be different  from  the  stock number  on the input. 5.2.13.3.8.  TCTO (K) Stock Numbers.   If  the  requested  stock number  contains  a K in position  5, the  ILS-S automatically  assigns  demand  code I.  See Para  5.2.10 for  more information  about demand  code usage. 5.2.13.3.9.  Force  Activity  Designator  (FAD).    If  the  issue  request  input  transaction FAD is  blank,  the  ILS-S assigns  the  FAD from  the  organization  (518) record. 5.2.13.3.10.  Off-Base  Organizations.   If  the  issue  request  is received  from  an off-base organization,  the  ILS-S computes  and  assigns  the  delivery  priority  to the  output  issue document. 5.2.13.3.11.  Issue  Exception  (IEX)  Code.  If  the  requested  item  contains  IEX  E or K, the serviceable  balance  must  be zero  or the issue  transaction  (ISU)  input  will  reject.   If AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 371 the IEX  E or K item  request  is  done using  degraded  operations  procedures  (TEX  6), or the  organization  is off-base,  the serviceable  balance  edit  does not  apply. 5.2.13.3.12.  Transaction  Exception  (TEX)  Code  T.    If  the  input  issue  transaction contains  TEX  T,  the  ILS-S  assigns  requisition  advice  code 2B.   See  Para  5.2.11  for more  information. 5.2.13.3.13.  Budget  Code.  The ILS-S applies  the budget  code from  the requested  item record. 5.2.13.3.14.  Controlled  Item  Code (CIC).  The  ILS-S applies  the  controlled  item  code from  the  requested  item  record. 5.2.13.3.15.  Other Customer  Issue Request  Edits.   Under  various  conditions,  customer issue  requests  are edited  for  quantity  and/or  unit  cost conditions  as follows: 5.2.13.3.15.1.  High  cost.   If  the  unit  cost  multiplied  by the  issue  input  transaction quantity  exceeds  ten  positions,  a 299 Reject  will  be produced.   See  AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7  for  more  information. 5.2.13.3.15.2.  Multiple  DIFM flag.   The item  record must  contain  a multiple  DIFM flag  if  the customer  issue  request  is  for a repair  cycle  item  (ERRCD  XF(*)/XD(*)), and the  input  quantity  is greater  than  one.  Otherwise,  the  quantity  will  be changed to one and an I001 MGT notice  (Quantity  Changed  to One; No Multiple  DIFM Flag Loaded for Non-Degraded  Operations)  will  be produced.  See  AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7  for  more  information  and processing  instructions. 5.2.13.3.15.3.  Type  account  code (TAC)  B.  If  the  requested  item  record has  type account  code  B  (supplies),  the  activity  code  on  the  issue  input  transaction  must equal  B, C,D, J, M, P, R, S, U, W, or X. 5.2.13.3.15.4.  Type  account  code (TAC)  E.   If  the  requested  item  record has  type account  code E (equipment),  the issue  input  transaction  activity  code must  equal  C, E, R, or P. 5.2.13.3.15.5.  Project  codes  175  and  Y31.    If  requested  assets  are  available,  the ILS-S  issues  the  requested  stock  number  unless  TEX  8,  H,  X,  or  Z  is  used  with project code 175 or Y31.  If any  one of these conditions  exists,  the ILS-S establishes a customer  backorder (due-out)  regardless  of  the on-hand  balance. 5.2.13.3.16.  Issue  of  Interchangeable  and  Substitute  Group  (ISG)  Items.    If  the customer  requirement  cannot  be satisfied  from  the  requested  stock number,  the  ILS-S checks for  an Interchangeable  and Substitute  Group (ISG) number  or relationship  code located  on the requested  stock number  item  record.  The ILS-S will  issue  the requested item  only  when  the  item  relationship  code  is  other  than  Master  (M),  Interchangeab le (I),  or  Substitute  (S).   Note:    The  ILS-S will  not  issue  interchangeable  items  across requested  items  containing  different  system  designators. 5.2.13.3.16.1.  Substitute  item  issues.   If the item  relationship  code is S (substitute), the  ILS-S issues  the  substitute  item  only  if  the  requested  quantity  and  the  unit  of issue  can be converted,  and the item  is not in  the D097 X file.   If  the requested  item is  a substitute,  and  other  master  or interchangeable  assets  are available,  the  ILS-S kills  the unsatisfied  quantity  and provides  an I023 management  notice  (Other  Asset 372 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 Data).   See  AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for  more  information  and  processing instructions. 5.2.13.3.16.2.  Master/interchangeable  item  issues.   If  the item  relationship  code is M  (master)  or I  (interchangeable),  the  ILS-S  checks  all  other  items  in  the  group containing  relationship  code M or I and issues  available  assets.  Note:   Relations hip code M and I assets  frozen  for  inventory  are bypassed.   If  the  relationship  code M and  I asset  contains  a subgroup  code (ISG order code) equal  to or greater  than  the subgroup  code  of  the  requested  stock  number,  the  asset  will  be  issued.    If relationship  code  M  and  I  assets  are  not  available  for  issue,  the  requested  stock number  will  be  killed  or  backordered  depending  upon  the  input  TEX  code.  Example:   Requested  item  is  in  subgroup  AA(*), requirement  can be satisfied  from subgroup  AB(*),  but requirements  for items  in  subgroup  AB(*) cannot  be satisfied from  items  in  subgroup  AA(*). 5.2.13.3.16.3.  Interchangeable  items  frozen  for  inventory.   If  requested  assets  are available,  but frozen  for inventory,  the ILS-S rejects  the input.   Additionally,  if  the requested  item  is  not  available,  and  M or I  related  assets  are available  but  frozen for  inventory,  the ILS-S automatically  kills  the  request  and provides  an I023 MGT notice. 5.2.13.3.16.4.  Unequal  units  of  issue.   If  the  requested  items  are  not  repair  cycle (ERRCD  XF(*)/XD(*)),  WRM,  MSK,  MRSP,  or  supply  point  assets,  and  the request  cannot  be satisfied  from  M or  I related  assets,  the  ILS-S  will  continue  to search  the group  for substitutes  (S) with  a convertible  unit  of  issue  and process the issue  request  as follows: 5.2.13.3.16.4.1.  If  substitute  assets are available,  the  ILS-S issues  the  assets  if the  requested  quantity  and the  units  of  issue  can be automatically  converted. 5.2.13.3.16.4.2.  If  the  units  of  issue  cannot  be  automatically  converted,  the ILS-S continues  to search  the group  for  other related  assets. 5.2.13.3.16.4.3.  If  other related  assets are available,  or a substitute  asset with  a convertible  unit  of  issue  is  located,  the  ILS-S kills  the  unsatisfied  quantity  and provides  an I023 MGT notice. 5.2.13.3.17.  Unfilled  Customer  Issue  Requests.   If  the  total  quantity  requested  cannot be satisfied  (filled),  the  ILS-S backorders  or kills  the  remaining  quantity  according  to the  input  TEX  code, NPPC, and priority  of the  request  as follows: 5.2.13.3.17.1.  If  the  input  issue  request  contains  TEX  7,  G,  or  M,  the  ILS-S backorders  the  unsatisfied  quantity.    See  Para  5.2.11  for  more  information  and processing  instructions. 5.2.13.3.17.2.  If  the  requested  item  contains  NPPC 4 or 9, the  ILS-S bypasses  the item  record  unless  the  input  supply  condition  code is  D  or J.  The  ILS-S kills  the unsatisfied  quantity  and  provides  an I023 MGT  notice.   See  AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7  for  more  information  and processing  instructions. 5.2.13.3.17.3.  Degraded  Operations  Processing  of Customer  Issue Requests.   If the customer  request  is  done  using  degraded  operations  procedures,  the  ILS-S issues AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 373 from  the  requested  stock number  only.   If  the  requested  stock number  is  frozen,  or if  insufficient  assets are available  on  the  item  record, the  ILS-S produces  a 469 or 290 Reject  respectively.   See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for  more  informat io n.  5.2.14.  Issue Exception  (IEX)  Code. 5.2.14.1.  Purpose.   To explain  the one-position  alpha/numeric  IEX  code assigned  to ILS-S item  records.   Issue  exception  codes identify  unique  issue  conditions  and/or  processing instructions  for items.   The IEX  code is  loaded to item  records by input  of a Stock Control Data (FCD) load, change,  and delete  transaction.   See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2B, Stockage Procedures  for  more  information  concerning  FCD  transactions.    Additionally,  standard IEX  codes that  apply  to every  item,  or a group  of  items,  may  be assigned  through  the  use of exception  phrase records.  Exception  phrase records are updated by  an Exception  Phrase Record (FXR) input  transaction.   See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for more  informat io n.  5.2.14.2.  Issue  Exception  Code (IEX)  Assignment  Rules. 5.2.14.2.1.  Major  commands/bases  may  assign  IEX  codes  to  identify  dual  issue conditions  such  as items  required  for  time  change  requirements.    Note:   Dual  codes will  not be assigned  for IEX  3, 4, 6, 7, 9, B, E, F, L, N, or O type conditions. 5.2.14.2.2.  IEX  codes  are  used  by  ILS-S  programs  for  a  variety  of  manage me nt decisions.   If  a  conflict  exists  on  assignment  of  two  or  more  IEX  codes,  local management  determines  the  appropriate  IEX  code to assign. 5.2.14.2.3.  IEX  codes P-Z are assigned  by MAJCOMs. 5.2.14.3.  Exception  Notice  Code (ENC)  Logic.   Each  IEX  code assigned  to  items  in  the ILS-S  requires  a  corresponding  Exception  Notice  Code  (ENC).    The  ENC  determines whether  related  issue  transactions  process or reject.   The  ENC is  located  on the  exception phrase  record (AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 8). Table 5.15.  Exception  Notice Code Logic Table.

IEX  6 and E are for  Individual  Equipment  Items. 2. See Ch 10 for proper assignment  of  these  codes. a. If  the LRS  CC/AO directs,  change  the ENC to P for IEX  9 items. b. If  the ENC is  changed  to P for IEX  9 items,  establish  local  procedures  IAW AFMAN23-122, Ch 5 to ensure  the DD  1348-1A output  issue  document  contains  the required certificate. 3. IEX  D is  assigned  by Stock Control  personnel  to improve  support  for customer requirements.   IEX D prevents  automatic  backorder of items  which  cannot  be requisitioned online.   An  example  of when  IEX D may  be used is  when  the  item  is  assigned  a requisition exception  (REX)  code 4 (do not  requisition),  REX  5 (requires  additional  information  from the  customer  prior  to requisitioning),  or when  the  item  has a NPPC 2, 3, 5, or 9 and a replacement  stock number  is  available.   See Para. 5.2.47. for  more  information  concerning REX  codes. Processing  instructions  for each  item  assigned  IEX  D should  be readily available  if  rejects occur.   This  will  ensure  processing  actions  are not  unnecessarily  delayed.   Additionally,  processing  actions  may  be entered  in  the  item  record nomenclature  field. However,  when  the  nomenclature  field  is  used for  processing  instructions,  the  instructions must  be complete  and understandable.  The  intent  of  using  this  method  is  to provide  enough information  on reject notices  so processing  of  the customer  request  is  not delayed.  Standard phrases  such  as:  ORDER  NHA, USE 1560001234567BF, or ORDER  REPAIR  KIT should be used instead  of local  abbreviations.  Caution:  Do not  use the  nomenclature  field  when processing  instructions  require  extensive  explanation,  multiple  stock numbers,  or information  which  exceeds the  available  positions  of the nomenclature.  In these  cases, use either  the  exception  control  card (ECC) image  for  the REX  assigned  (if  applicable)  or an ECC for  the IEX  D.  The objective  is  to make  it  easier  to satisfy  customer  demands  without unnecessary  delay.  Any  method  that  satisfies  this  objective  is  allowed  if  locally  documented in  either  a supplement  or local  operating  instruction. 4. IEX  G is  assigned  for  Civil  Engineering  request. 5. The  following  information  applies: a. If  the major  command  desires,  maintain  ECC images  for IEX  P through  Z. b. If  local  management  desires,  maintain  ECC images  for IEX  1 through  9 and A through O.  Normally,  ECC images  are not maintained  for these  IEX  codes. 6. Assign  IEX  H to QEC kits  and afterburners. 7. Assign  IEX  7 to all  hazardous  material/waste  item  records. IEX  7 will  not be used in place  of IEX  9. 8. Assign  IEX  9 to items  containing  ODCs as determined  by the  HAZMART/BES.   For these  types  of items,  all  customer  issue  requests  must  be accompanied  by an approved Air Force waiver. 9. IEX  B is  not required  for serialized  small  arms  which  have  serialized  report  code (SRC) A assigned  or CIC 9 items  which  have  SRC of C assigned.   SRCs are normally  loaded automatically  through  Stock Number  User Directory  (SNUD)  (BME)  change  transactions received  from  the  Cataloging  and Standardization  Center (CASC).  5.2.15.

To explain  the output  issue  (ISU/MSI/DOR)  document  (DD 1348-1A) flow  and processing  procedures. 5.2.16.2.  Most retail  materiel  management  activities  use Asset Tracking  System’s  to create the  DD  1348-1A output  documents.   The  output  issue  documents  are  used  to initiate  and track  the  physical  movement  of  customer-requested  materiel.   Some  locations,  however, continue  to  use  DD  1348-1A  issue  documents  output  by  the  ILS-S.    Regardless  of  the output  issue  document  source,  the  document  flows  through  the  materiel  picking  and delivery  processes  as illustrated  in  Figure  5.2. 382 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 Figure  5.2.

Refer  to  AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch  7  for  more  information  concerning  the  following management  notices.    Note:    One  copy  of  all  output  management  notices  indicating  a bench  stock item  will  be provided  to Bench  Stock Support. 5.2.17.4.1.  I004 MGT  Notice  I004 (ISU  Kill   DUO).   Destroy  the  I004 MGT  notice when  this  notice  is  received  indicating  the  total  requested  quantity  was  issued  to  the customer. 5.2.17.4.2.  I004 MGT  Notice.   If  the killed  issue  request  is  subsequently  cancelled  by the customer,  send the  I004 MGT  Notice (at the  option  of MAJCOM) to the  requesting organization  or activity,  with  the name  of the individual  authorizing  the cancellation  in Block  D. 5.2.17.4.3.  I023  MGT  Notice.    If  the  issue  request  is  killed,  and  other  assets  are available,  an I023 MGT  notice  is  produced.   If  suitable  assets  are available,  issue  the assets  using  the  originally  requested  document  number.    Distribute  the  I023  MGT notice  when  the requested  quantity  was killed  as follows: 5.2.17.4.3.1.  Available  Assets.    Verify  UND  A  or  B  issue  requests  with  the customer  when  suitable  assets  are  available.   If  available  suitable  assets  are subsequently  issued,  destroy  the  I023  MGT  notice  when  the  request  has  been satisfied. 5.2.17.4.3.2.  Unavailable  Assets.    Verify  UND  A  or  B  requests  when  suitable assets are not available.   If backorder (due-out)  is requested  by the customer,  reinput the  issue  request  transaction  with  TEX  M  in  position  51.    After  successful 386 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 processing,  and at the option  of the MAJCOM, destroy all  copies  of the  I023 MGT notice  or  forward  to  the  requesting  organization  (non-DIFM  items).    For  DIFM items,  send  two copies  of  the  I023 MGT  notice  to the  requesting  organization  and 2 copies  to the  FSC. 5.2.18.  Customer  Backorders. 5.2.18.1.  Firm/Memorandum  (Memo) Customer  Backorders.  A customer  backorder (due-out) is established  in  the ILS-S when  requested materiel  is not available  to satisfy  customer need.    The  ILS-S  performs  numerous  edits  on  backorder  requirements  and  determines whether  or  not  the  requirement  will  be  requisitioned  from  the  source  of  supply.    When requisition  transactions  are created,  firm customer  backorders  are  established.   When  the ILS-S or management  determines  no requisitioning  action  should  be taken, a memorandum (memo)  customer  backorder is  created. 5.2.18.1.1.  Firm  customer  backorders.   Under  normal  circumstances,  when  requested materiel  is not available  to satisfy  customer  need, firm  customer  backorders are created and  requisitioning  action  taken.   A  firm  customer  backorder  (due-out)  denotes  ILS-S requisitioning  action  to fill  the  requirement.   In  other  words,  a requisition  transact ion has  been  submitted  to the  source  of  supply  to satisfy  the  customer  request.   There  are circumstances  when  submitting  a requisition  to a source  of supply  is  inappropriate.   In these  cases, a memo  customer  backorder is  created. 5.2.18.1.2.  Memorandum  (memo)  customer  backorders.  A memo  customer  backorder (due-out)  indicates  requisitioning  action  to fill  the  customer  requirement  has  not  been taken.  Examples  of when  the ILS-S automatically  creates memo  backorders (due-outs) include  customer  funds  expired,  Supply  Point  and WRM kit  replenishments,  and when requested  items  contain  some  sort  of  restriction  and  contain  a  requisition  exception (REX)  code.  Additionally,  memo  customer  backorders  can be created manually  using a transaction  exception  (TEX)  code on the customer  issue  request.  Refer  to Para 5.2.11 for  an explanation  of  TEX  codes used  on customer  issue  requests. 5.2.18.2.  ILS-S Backorder  Edits.   The  ILS-S performs  a funds  availability  edit  against  the requesting  organization’s  project  funds  management  record (PFMR)  when  a backorder  is to  be  established  with  obligated  customer  funds.    Organizational  funds  are  obligated  to fund  ILS-S backorders if  the requested  items  are contained  in  the Material  Support Divis io n (MSD), or General  Support Division  (GSD) of the Air  Force Supply  Management  Activit y Group (SMAG).  Refer  to AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2C, Financial  Management  for ILS-S due-out  detail  record obligation  procedures.   Note:   Fund  availability  edits  are not  performed in  some  circumstances.   See Para  5.2.11 for  more  details. 5.2.18.3.  Backorder  (Due-Out)  Cause  Code Assignment.    The  ILS-S  assigns  backorder (due-out)  cause  codes  to  each  customer  backorder  to  assist  management  with  decisions associated  with  retail  stockage  policy.   The  cause  code  provides  valuable  information  to target  improved  management  practices  when  necessary.   Assignment  of  backorder  (due-out)  cause codes are based upon whether  the items  are stocked (demand-based  stock level) or non-stocked items.   Refer  to Para  5.2.20 for  detailed  explanations  of stocked and  non-stocked backorder cause  codes.  See Ch  2 for  an explanation  of  demand-based  stock level computations. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 387 5.2.18.4.  Mission  Capable  (MICAP)  Backorders.    Mission  Capable  (MICAP)  customer backorders  are the  highest  form  of  expedite  backorder established  in  the  ILS-S.  MICAP customer  backorders are established  when  the lack of requested  item(s)  negatively  impacts the  mission  of  the  organization,  unit,  or  wing.    Therefore,  MICAP  backorders  require special  processes  to ensure  customer  backorders are afforded  the highest  level  of visibilit y and management  attention.   MICAP conditions  require  intense  scrutiny  and verification  to ensure  item  shortages  are  satisfied locally  by  all  means  possible  prior  to  backorder establishment.   See Para  5.2.9 for  more  information  concerning  MICAP backorders. 5.2.19.  ILS-S Memorandum  (MEMO) Backorder  Logic. 5.2.19.1.  Purpose.    Describe  conditions  when  memorandum  (memo)  backorders  are created in  the ILS-S. 5.2.19.2.  Transaction  Exception  (TEX)  Code.  When  the TEX  code on the  customer  issue request  equals  1, 7, 8, 9, G, H,  P, or  Y, a memo  backorder  (due-out)  is  established.   See Para  5.2.11  for  more information. 5.2.19.3.  Supply  Point  and  Mission  Support  Kit  (MSK) Items.   For all  Supply  Point  and MSK detail  record replenishments,  a memo  backorder is  created. 5.2.19.4.  Requisition  Exception  (REX)  Code Usage.   When  a REX  code is  assigned  to the item  record,  a memo  backorder  is  established.   This  will  cause  the  ILS-S to create  a 350 MGT notice  (Requisition  Suppressed  by REX/NPPC/Bud  CD/ERRCD/QUP  or Local  U/I).  See   AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt  2,  Ch  7    for  more  information  and  processing  instruct io ns concerning  350  MGT  notices.    See  Para  5.2.47  for  more  information  concerning  REX code usage. 5.2.19.5.  Insufficient  Funds.    When  funds  are  not  available  in  the  stock  fund  to support requisitioning  action,  a memo  backorder is  created  and  a funds  requirement  (FRC) image is  created for  external  action.   See Para  5.2.53 for  more  information. 5.2.19.6.  Budget  Code 9 Equipment  Items.   For all  customer  backorder requirements  for equipment items  containing  budget  code  9  and  ERRCD  NF(*)  or  ND(*),  a  memo backorder is  created. 5.2.20.  Backorder  (Due-Out)  Cause Code. 5.2.20.1.  Purpose.   To  explain  the  assignment  and  use  of  the  backorder  (due-out)  cause codes in  the ILS-S. the  stock  position 5.2.20.2.  Definition  of  Backorder  (Due-Out)  Cause  Codes.    Backorder  (due-out)  cause codes  identify in  the  ILS-S  at  the  time  a  customer  backorder  is established.   The  due-out cause code is also used to isolate  causes  for backorders, and what action(s)  is needed to prevent  recurrence  of the problem.   For MICAP customer  backorders, the  due-out cause  code is  entered  in  position  26 of the  MICAP report (B9M) transaction. 5.2.20.3.  Base  Stock Levels  Defined.   Items  are generally  classified  as stocked  and  non-stocked.    Stocked  items  are  normally  assigned  demand-based  stock  levels  that  contain either  full,  or less  than  full  base  stock  on  hand.   The  ILS-S makes  this  determination  by comparing  the  serviceable  property  on  hand  to the  demand-based  stock  level  quantity.   If the  quantity  on  hand  is  less  than  the  demand-based  stock  level  quantity,  the  item  is considered  to be at less  than  full  base stock. 388 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.2.20.3.1.  Stocked  Item  - Full  Base  Stock.   Stocked  items  with  full  base  stock  are defined  as  total  stock  on  hand  (serviceable  +  unserviceable  - reparable)  equal  to  or greater  than  the  total  stock  authorized.    Note:    For non-recoverable  items,  full  base stock  is  defined  as  assets  in  stock  (on-hand)  equal  to  or greater  than  the  safety  level quantity,  plus  the  WRM on-hand  quantity. 5.2.20.3.2.  Stocked Item  - Less  than  Full  Base  Stock.  Stocked item  backorder  cause codes are assigned  due to insufficient  assets available  to support  a demand-based  stock level.   Stocked items  with  less  than  full  base  stock are defined  as total  stock  on-hand (serviceable  +  unserviceable)  less  than  total  stock  authorized.   Note:      For  non-recoverable  items,  less  than  full  base  stock  equals  the  total  stock  on  hand,  minus quantity  committed  to WRM, is  less  than  the safety  level  quantity. 5.2.20.4.  Non-stocked Item  Backorder  Cause Codes.  Non-stocked item  backorder  cause codes are assigned  due  to insufficient  item  demand  history  for  computation  of  a demand -based stock level.   Normally,  non-stocked item  cause  codes consist  of three  general  groups of  items  including:  items  with  no  previous  demand  (first-time)  or  not  enough  demand history;  items  the  ILS-S has  decided  not  to stock; and  items  management  has  decided  not to stock.  See Table 5.24 for more information  and explanation  of each type of non-stocked item  backorder cause  code. Table 5.24.  Non-stocked Item Due-Out Cause Codes. Cause Code A B C D Explanation No stock level  established  – First  time  recurring  demand.   No previous demand  or reparable  generation  before  this  request.   This  code is  assigned  to change/transfer/or  stop MICAP report (B9(*))  transactions  by the ILS-S when the  type account  code is  E (equipment)  or K (munitions).   No stock level  established  - Past recurring  demand  or reparable  generation experience  but  Air  Force stockage  policy  precluded  establishment  of a demand-based  stock level. Air  Force stockage  policy  permits  a demand-based  stock level,  but  an external decision  by HQ AFMC has determined  that  stocking  the  item  at the  base should  be restricted.   This  Cause Code is also  assigned  when  Air  Force stockage  policy  permits  a demand-based  stock level  for the  item,  but  only non-recurring  demands  have  occurred  on the  NSN.  Base decision  not  to stock the  item.   A demand-based  stock level  exists,  but the  base has taken  action  not  to stock the item  such  as assigning  a maximum level  of zero. Table 5.25.  Stocked Item Due-Out  Cause Codes. Cause code Explanation F Full  base stock - Depth  of  stock insufficient  to meet  MICAP/due-out requirement. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 389 G H J K R S T X Full  base stock - Quantity  necessary  for requirement  is in  AWP status.   The  number  of recoverable  items  in  need of repair  is equal  to or greater than  the authorized  stock level.   Identifies  repair  part shortages.   Assumes if  repair  parts had been  available,  a serviceable  asset  would  have  been available. Less than  full  base stock - Stock replenishment  requisition  exceeds priority  group  UMMIPS  standards.   Focus attention  on source  of supply processing  of  stock replenishment  requisitions.   Note:   Will  also  be assigned  when  a due-out  has been manually  linked  to a stock replenishment  due-in. Less than  full  base stock - Stock replenishment  requisition  does not exceed priority  group  UMMIPS standards.   Additional  follow-up  or upgrade  action  may  be required.   Note:   Will  also  be assigned  when  a due-out  has been manually  linked  to a stock replenishment  due-in. Less than  full  base stock - No stock replenishment  due-in  established.   Take action  to determine  the reason. Full  base stock – Assets  cannot  be used to satisfy  this  requirement because  they  are deployed,  inaccessible  (off-base  supply  point),  or unavailable. Less than  full  base stock.  Stock replenishment  requisition  exceeds UMMIPS time  standards  by priority  group  and  AWP assets are on order at time  of MICAP. Less than  full  base stock.  Stock replenishment  requisition  does not exceed UMMIPS  time  standards  by priority  group  and AWP assets are on order at time  of MICAP. Less than  full  base stock.  No due-in  established  and AWP assets are on hand  at time  of MICAP. Table 5.26.  Special Purpose  Due-Out  Cause Codes. Cause Code Y Z Explanation Data not  available  on manually  prepared MICAP Start report (B9M) transactions  due  to the  ILS-S being  inoperative  for  unscheduled maintenance. System/Commodity  received  without  MICAP item  (initial  shortage).   Cause code Z identifies  MICAP incidents  due to a lack  of initial  stockage at the base.  This  code alerts  management  to the  problem  and identifies the  items  involved.   Note:   Cause code Z qualifies  for  one of the  other cause  codes, but the  items  involved  require  special  management  attention.   1-6 Command  unique. 390 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 Note:   Cause codes E, I, L-Q, U-W are not used. 5.2.21.

When  B91 interrogation  transactions are received  and a valid  base MICAP does not exist,  a 260 Reject  will  occur.  See  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for  more  information  concerning  260 rejects.   The  following responses  are appropriate,  depending  on the  situation: 5.2.30.2.2.1.  MICAP  Submitted  in  Error.   If  a MICAP  requisition  was  submitted in  error,  downgrade  or cancel  the MICAP requisition  in  the  ILS-S. 5.2.30.2.2.2.  MICAP Condition  Not Identified.   If  the  requisition  is  on file  in  the ILS-S but  not  identified  as  MICAP, upgrade  the  requisition  to MICAP reportable using  an NOR input  transaction  - Format  B.  Use the requisition  date from  the  B91 transaction  document  number  as the  action  date in  the NOR transaction  input.   See Para  5.2.75 for  more information. 5.2.30.2.2.3.  MICAP Not Established  - Rejected.   If the MICAP condition  was not established  due  to  rejected  transactions,  reprocess  the  issue  transaction  with  N in position  54 and  TEX  code 7 in  position  51.  This  will  create  a memo  backorder  in the ILS-S.  Next, process a special  requisition  transaction  using  the same requisit io n number  indicated  on the B91 interrogation  in positions  30-43 and the customer  due-out  document  number  in  positions  67-80.  These  actions  will  establish  the  MICAP condition  in  the  ILS-S and  create  an associated  MICAP report  (B9M)  transaction.   See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5B,  Order and  Requisitioning  and  Para  5.2.1 for  more information  concerning  issue  transaction  format  and  processing  procedures.

B94  error  transactions  are used  to interrogate  and  correct invalid  MICAP  data  and  produce  corrected  MICAP  report  transactions.    The  error  code (position  68) on each B94 error transaction  identifies  the error condition.   See Para  5.2.34 for a list  and explanation  of error codes.  When  invalid  data cannot  be corrected  automatically  by the  ILS-S, a 288 reject  will  be produced  and  the  invalid  data  will  be identified  on the  reject.  Correct the  invalid  data on the  B94 error transaction  and  reprocess.  See  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7  for  more  information  concerning  288 rejects. 5.2.32.1.  No  Valid  MICAP  Exists.    When  B94  error  transactions  are  processed,  and MICAP details  are not on file,  an I124 MGT notice  (MICAP Requisition  - Error Exception Notice)  is  produced.    See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  7  for  more  information  and processing  instructions  concerning  I124 MGT notices.   Corrective  action  includes  research and  verification  of  the  requisition  number  cited  in  positions  30-43.   Additionally,  if  the advice  code in  position  70 equals  L,  verify  the  document  number  in  positions  71-78.   If either  of the document  numbers  are in  error, correct and reprocess the B94 error transaction.   If  the document  numbers  are correct, no further  action  is  required. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 401 5.2.32.2.  Manual  Error  Correction.   When  the ILS-S cannot  automatically  correct  invalid data,  Mission  Support  will  receive  an  I123  MGT  notice  (No  Error  Detected  - Research Req).   If  the  error  cannot  be corrected  by  Mission  Support  personnel,  the  initiator  of  the reject  must  be contacted  to determine  the invalid  condition.   If the  invalid  conditions  have been corrected, a MICAP report (B9M) transaction  must  be manually  prepared and sent  to the  initiator.   See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more  information. 5.2.32.3.  Purpose.    To  explain  processing  procedures  and  transaction  format  for  the MICAP Error (B94) transaction.   The B94 transaction  is produced by the MICAP reporting (D165B) system  to identify  errors on base MICAP report (B9M)  transactions.   Transaction error  codes,  identifying  the  reason  for  the  error,  are  listed  in  Para  5.2.34.

AFMC  centrally  manages  asset requisitions  (unless  otherwise  assigned,  e.g.,  MICAPs,  AWPs,  local  RIDs,  etc.)  from the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity.  Air  Force  policy  specifies  all  ILS-S output requisition  (A0*)  transactions  will  be produced  in  MILSTRIP  or DLMS  format.  The ILS-S  automatically  produces  requisition requirements  are computed  through  stock  replenishment  or  customer  requests.  Therefore,  automate d due-out  requisitioning  occurs  when  customers  request  items  from  the  LRS/Materie l Management  Activity  that  are not available  from  shelf  stock. The  ILS-S will  normally establish  a customer  due-out detail;  create a receipt  due-in  detail;  and produce an output requisition  (A0*)  transaction  for the  source  of supply.  Automated  stock replenishme nt requisitioning  occurs when  the ILS-S requirements  computation  program  identifies  on-hand  stocks below  the reorder point  (ROP). AMC Forward Supply  Location  (FSL) will use automated  requisition  procedures  for all  stock replenishment  requirements  with  the exception  of  built-up.  Process  lateral  requisitions  for  built-up  assemblies to  the designated  Primary  Supply  Point  (PSP) using  the fill  or back-order advice  code. Note: The  requisition  quantity  is  the  difference  between  the  requisitioning  objective  and available  assets.  See  AFMAN  23-122,  Sec.  2B,  Stockage  Procedures  for  more information  concerning  the  requirements  computation  program,  reorder  point,  and requisitioning  quantity.  See Para  5.2.37 for  ILS-S requisition  (A0*) transaction  output format  and  processing  instructions.  The  ILS-S  creates  a  single  requisition  for  each “firm”  customer  due-out  (activity  codes D, J, R, or  X that  require  requisition  action). is  equal  to  the  due-out  quantity, For  customer  due-outs,  the  requisition  quantity including  multiple  DIFM  XD  due-outs.

ILS-S  requisition  data  elements.   All  MILSTRIP  and  DLMS  requisit io n transactions  are  designed  to  contain  common  data  that  may  be  shared  by  retail  and wholesale  supply  systems.    See  Para  5.2.38  for  detailed  descriptions  and  usages  of  the source  of supply;  requisition  date; document  identifier  code (DIC);  routing  identifier  code (RIC);  media  and  status  (M&S)  code;  quantity  unit  pack  (QUP);  requisition  document number;  requisition  demand  code; supplementary  address;  requisition  priority  designator; required  delivery  date  (RDD);  project  code;  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  (JCS)/intra-Air  Force project code; and requisition  advice  code. 5.2.36.3.  Requisition  quantity  and  cost  edits.    For  most  items,  the  ILS-S  validates  the requisition  quantity  and  cost  when  requisitions  are  created.    The  ILS-S  will  not  do  a reasonable  quantity  check  for  supply  items  containing  a blank  budget  code  (invest me nt items)  or items  that  contain  Budget  Codes A-H, J-U, or W-X.  See Para  5.2.39 for  more information  concerning  requisition  quantity  and/or  cost edits. 5.2.36.4.  Uniform  Materiel  Movement  and Issue  Priority  Standards  (UMMIPS).   Priority designators  for  customer  due-out  or  stock  replenishment  requisitions  relate  to  specific UMMIPS  time  standards  that  are  used  to  ensure  expedient  processing  by  both  retail  and wholesale  supply  activities.   UMMIPS standards track the amount  of time  required  between all  facets  of  the  requisition  pipeline.   For example,  requisitions  are tracked  from  the  time of submission,  during  wholesale  system  processing,  and through  subsequent  shipment  and receipt.   Specific  UMMIPS  standards  have  been  established  for  each  requisition  priority group  within  Required  Delivery  Date (RDD).   Additionally,  different  standards  have  been established  for  both  CONUS  and  OCONUS  requisitions.   See  Para  5.2.46  for  more information  concerning  UMMIPS standards  for  ILS-S requisitions. 5.2.36.5.  Requisition  restrictions.  Under certain  conditions,  the ILS-S will  not produce requisitions  when  required.  Item  and  funds-specific  requisition  restrictions  may  be implemented  to allow  for  strict  management  of  the  General  Support  Division  (GSD) stock  fund.  Primarily,  item  and  fund  restrictions  delay  or  cancel  requisitions  prior  to the  output  of  a  requisition  transaction.  In  some  cases,  GSD  funding  limitations  will cause  the  ILS-S  to  create  a  Funds  Requirement  (FRC)  output  image  instead  of  a requisition.  FRC  output  images  are  used  to  hold  the  requirement  (requisition)  in  a delayed  status  until  funding  confirmation  is  received  from  the  LRS/AFMC  or  the requirement  no longer  exists. 5.2.36.5.1.  Item-specific  requisition  restrictions.   Some  requisition  restrictions  are based on the type of item  or specific  item  coding.   Item-specific  requisition  restrictio ns include:   requisition  exception  coding;  shelf  life  coding;  and certain  stockage  priority code (SPC) assignments.   The  following  paragraphs  discuss  the different  types  of item-specific  requisition  restrictions  available  in  the ILS-S. 5.2.36.5.1.1.  Requisition  exception  (REX)  codes.  REX  codes are  used  to restrict requisitions  for specific  items  that are requisitioned  using  special  procedures;  when additional  information  is  required;  or for  items  that  are never  requisitioned  in  the ILS-S.    See  Para  5.2.47    for  a  complete  list  of  REX  codes  and  processing instructions  for each. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 407 5.2.36.5.1.2.  Shelf  life  codes.    Shelf  life  codes  are  established  in  the  ILS-S  to identify  the number  of months  new items  may  remain  unused  in  storage before  they must  be reconditioned  or condemned.   The  ILS-S assigns  and uses  shelf  life  codes to  figure  how  many  items  to  requisition  automatically  to  replenish  stock.    To determine  the  number,  the  ILS-S divides  the  number  of  shelf  life  days  by two  (2), and  then  multiplies  the  resulting  number  by  the  daily  demand  rate  (DDR).   Note:   The  shelf  life  code  does  not  identify  the  shelf  life  remaining  on  any  particular unit(s)  of  on-hand  stock.  See Ch  2 for  more  information  about  ILS-S requisit io n restrictions  based upon  shelf  life  coding. 5.2.36.5.1.3.  Stockage  Priority  Code (SPC).  The  SPC is  assigned  by  the ILS-S to expendable  (ERRCD  XB3)  items.   Stockage  priority  codes are  one  of  the  factors used  to  determine  the  number  of  demands  an  item  experiences  in  a  year.   Once determined,  a corresponding  demand-based stock level  can be established.   In some cases, SPC assignment  may  restrict  automatic  stock  replenishment  requisitioning.   See AFMAN  23-122, Sec 2B,  Stockage  Procedure  for  more  information  on  SPC use and assignment. 5.2.36.5.2.  Funds-Specific  Requisition  Restrictions.   The  ILS-S  will  not  produce automatic  requisitions  when  selected  funds-specific  requisition  restrictions  are applied on the  MACR.   There  are generally  three  methods  to restrict  automatic  requisitions  in the  ILS-S.  First,  the  Materiel  Acquisition  Control  Record  (MACR)  may  be coded to suppress  requisitioning  for  categories  of  General  Support  Division  (GSD)  items.   Second,  a  requisition  suppression  flag  may  be  assigned  to  restrict  requisitioning.   Finally,  funding  restrictions  may  be applied  in  the ILS-S based upon  source  of  supply and requisition  dollar  values.   The  following  paragraphs  describe  these  different  types of funds-specific  requisition  restrictions. 5.2.36.5.2.1.  MACR.    The  MACR  is  used  to  track  expenses  (obligations/gross sales/credit  returns)  within  the  GSD stock fund.   The  GSD  MACR is  also  used by management  to suppress  requisitions  in  the ILS-S.  The  fund’s  manager  establishes a MACR for all  budget  code 9 and Z items  within  each retail  Materiel  Management Activity.   The  MACR  includes  the  number  of  obligations  authorized  and  placed.   Therefore,  the  MACR  allows  management  of  inventories  within  the  GSD  stock fund  by  controlling  spending.   See  Ch  5 for  an  explanation  of  how  the  obligat io n and  commitments  fields  of  the  MACR  are updated.   Note:   If  requisitions  should be  restricted  for  stock  replenishment  or  customer  requirements, the  Financia l Working  Group  (FWG)  will  be  briefed  to  the  extent  and  time  period  of  the restriction. that customer  requests  may  not  be filled.   For example,  organizations  will  be informed that  requisitioning  of  items  for  customer  due-outs  may  be  delayed  until  MACR restrictions  are  lifted.    Explanation  of  MACR  effects  on  ILS-S  requisitions is provided  in  Para  5.2.50.   This  information  will  be  used  to  inform  base  organizations 5.2.36.5.2.2.  Requisition  suppression  flag.   Another  funds-specific  requisitio ning restriction  is  the assignment  of  the  requisition  suppression  flag.   If  the dollar  value of  ILS-S requisitions  exceed the  Total  Obligations  Authorized  (TOA)  dollar  value on  the  GSD  MACR,  the  ILS-S  will  output  an  A977  MGT  notice  and  set  the requisition  suppression  flag  to “on”  in  the  MACR.   See DFAS-DE  7077.10-M for 408 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 more  details  on  exceeding  MACR  TOA  dollar  values.    See  Ch  5  for  more information  concerning  the assignment  of  the requisition  suppression  flag. 5.2.36.5.2.3.  Other  funds-specific  requisition  restrictions.    Other  funds-specific requisition to  ILS-S  requisitions  based  upon  routing identifier  code (RIC),  requisition  value,  and  base  location.   See Ch  5 for  detailed descriptions  of  other  funds-specific  requisition  restrictions. restrictions  are  applied 5.2.36.5.3.  Fund  requirement  (FRC) output  image.  The  ILS-S will  produce  a FRC output  image  for  management  review  if  the  requisition  is  suppressed  by  either MACR  edits,  requisition  suppression  flags,  or  other  funds-specific types  of restrictions.    AFMC  maintains  the  FRC  file.  The  FRC  file  consists  of  customer request  and  stock replenishment  restricted  requisition  requirements  that  have  been restricted.  Note:  Each  FRC output  image  contains  a Funds  Requirement  Indicator (FRI) that identifies  the reason for requisition  suppression.  See Para 5.2.53 for more information  concerning fund requirement  indicators,  and  the  format  and  processing  instructions  for  FRC  file images. ILS-S  funds-specific restrictions, requisition   LMARS/CWT (LMARS/CWT). 5.2.36.6.  Memorandum  Requisition  Data  To  DLATS.    DLATS  maintains logist ics pipeline  information  for  all  wholesale  items  in  the  Logistics  Metrics  Analysis  Reporting System/Customer  Wait  Time is  populated  with information  from  the  MILSTRIP,  MILSTRAP,  and DLMS  transactions  that  flow  through DLATS.  Off-line  requisitions  that  initially  bypass  DLATS  (for  example,  those  directly input  into  wholesale  systems  when  called  in)  will  not  generate  MILSTRIP  or  DLMS transactions.   In  order  to  ensure  these  off-line  requisitions  are  correctly  recorded  in LMARS/CWT,  the  ILS-S  will  generate  and  route  Memorandum  Requisition  Data  to DLATS  (DIC  CHA/CH1)  to  DLATS  when  a  special  requisition  (SPR)  transaction is processed to any RID beginning  with  F (i.e., F**) or DLJ and a document  number  is entered in  positions  30-43  of  the  SPR  input.   CHA/CH1  transactions  are  used  to  begin  a requisitioning  event  and  are  used  to  compute  customer  wait  time  in  the  LMARS.    No images  are  produced  for  other  sources  of  supply  because  they  (DLA/GSA/etc.)  already have  a process to update LMARS. 5.2.37.  Requisition  Output  (A0*) Transaction. 5.2.37.1.  Purpose.   The  requisition  output  (A0*)  transaction  is  used  to notify  sources  of supply  of base requisitioning  action  for  customer  (due-out)  and stock replenishment  (due-in)  requirements. 5.2.37.2.  Output  Destination.   RPS/main  system  or satellite  terminal. 5.2.37.3.  Input.   None. 5.2.37.4.  Output  Format.  See Table 5.43 below.

Source  of  Supply.   Normally,  sources  of  supply  for  retail  materiel management  activities  are  comprised  of  HQ AFMC, DLA,  GSA,  Local  Procurement (LP),  Local  Manufacture  (LM),  and other  base (Lateral)  sources.   The  ILS-S converts the  source of  supply  internally  to a corresponding  routing  identifier  code (RIC).  Once translated  and  assigned the  RIC  is  displayed  automatically  on  output requisition  (A0*)  transactions. internally, ILS-S-generated  and  manually 5.2.38.2.2.  Requisition  Date.  All initiated requisitions  must  contain  the current  Julian  date. Computer  Operations  section  will normally  change  the  ILS-S  date  when  the  beginning-of-day  (BOD)  input is processed.  When  AFMC specifies  a date  change,  the  requisition  serial  number  is reset to 0001.  See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 3, Ch 2 for the procedures used to change the  ILS-S requisition  date. 5.2.38.2.3.  Document  Identifier  Code (DIC).   ILS-S  requisition  transactions  may  be assigned  different  DICs based upon  the  type  of requirement  and base location.   Table  5.45  explains  assignment  of  DICs.    For  the  format  and  processing  instructions  for output  requisition  (A0*)  transactions,  see  Para 5.2.37. Table 5.45.  Requisition  Document  Identifier  Code (DIC) Assignment.

See the Requisit io n Routing  Identifier  Code Directory  located  in AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for a list  of RICs and the  corresponding  source  of Materiel  Management  Activity. 5.2.38.2.5.  Media  and  Status  Code  (M&S).    The  M&S  code  identifies  the  type  and amount  of  status  to  be received  by  requisitioning  activities.   Every  ILS-S  requisit io n must  have  a valid  M&S code assigned.   The  M&S code for  requisitions  is  determined by  the  requisition  priority.   Media  and  status  code “S”  is  assigned  to  priority  01-08 requisitions.    Media  and  status  code  “K”  is  assigned  to  priority  09-15  requisitio ns.   Note:   MAJCOMS may  specify  changes  to M&S code assignments.   The  M&S code is  loaded  on the  ILS-S base constants  record.  For satellite  activities,  the M&S code is loaded  on the  satellite  organization  cost center  record (OCCR).  See DLM 4000.25-1-M for  M&S codes used  on ILS-S requisitions.   See AFH  Vol  2, Pt  2, Ch  8 for  more information  on application  of the  M&S on the  OCCR. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 413 5.2.38.2.6.  Requisition  Document  Number.   The  requisition  document  number  is  used to  identify  individual  customer  (due-out)  or  stock  replenishment  requisitions.    The requisition  document  number  is 14 positions  and constructed  as follows: 5.2.38.2.6.1.  Service  code.  For Air  Force ILS-S requisitions,  the  first  position  of the  document  number  will  always  be “F”. 5.2.38.2.6.2.  Requisitioner  identification.    The  second  through  sixth  positions  of the document  number  normally  contain  “B”  (supplies)  or “E”  (equipment)  followed by  the  last  four  positions  of  the  Stock  Record  Account  Number  (SRAN)  that identifies  the base. 5.2.38.2.6.3.  Julian  date.  The  seventh  through  tenth  positions  contain  the  current four  position  Julian  date. 5.2.38.2.6.4.  Serial  number.    Lastly,  the  eleventh  through  fourteenth  positions contain  the  requisition  serial  number.    Requisition  serial  number  assignment  is performed  either  internally  (system)  or manually  (offline).    Each  day,  requisit io n serial  numbers  0001 through  9999 are available  for use.  Blocks of requisition  serial numbers  are  used  for  specific  purposes  and  conditions.    See  Para  5.2.41  for explanation  and construction  of requisition  serial  numbers  in  the  ILS-S. 5.2.38.2.7.  Requisition  Demand  Code.    The  requisition  demand  code  indicates  the frequency  (how  often)  and  circumstances  under  which  items  are requisitioned.   There are four  demand  codes assigned  to requisitions  produced  by the  ILS-S.  Note:   If  not specified  by  the  customer  during  issue  requests,  always  default  to  a  recurring- t ype demand  code.  This  will  ensure  potentially  valid  customer  history  is  recorded  by  the ILS-S.    See  Para  5.2.42  for  more  information  concerning  requisition  demand  code assignment. requisition  data receiving   The supplementary to  sources  of  supply address  provides 5.2.38.2.8.  Supplementary  Address. supplemental retail  Materiel Management  Activity  requisitions.    For  example,  HQ  AFMC  uses  supplementar y address  data  to  estimate  second  destination  transportation  costs.   The  supplementar y address  is  displayed  differently  based  upon  whether  the  requisition  is  for  a  customer (due-out)  or  stock  replenishment  requirement.    For stock  replenishment  requisitio ns, the  default  supplementary  address  field  contains the  first  six  positions  of  the organization  title  from  the  Organization  Cost  Center  Record  (OCCR).  For  customer (due-out)  requisitions,  the default  supplementary  address field  contains  a constant  “Y” in  the  first  position,  the  urgency  justification  code  (UJC)  from  the  customer  due-out detail  in  the  next  two  positions,  and  the  standard  reporting  designator  (SRD)  or  de indicated  on  the  customer  issue  request  in  the  last  three  positions.   For  requisit io ns designated  for customer  (due-out)  requirements,  the supplementary  address field  of the corresponding  (linked)  ILS-S due-in  detail  will  also contain  these same  data.

The  priority designator  assigned  depends on whether  the requisition  supports  customer  (due-out)  or 414 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 stock  replenishment  requirements.   See  Para  5.2.43  for  an  overall  discussion  of  the factors  used  to determine  the  correct  requisition  priority  as discussed  in  the  following paragraphs. for  customer  (due-out)  requirements.   The 5.2.38.2.9.1.  Priority  assignment priority  designator  assigned  to  customer  due-out  requisitions  depends  upon  a combination  of the urgency  of need designator  (UND) and force activity  designator (FAD).  The  UND is  the first  position  of the  urgency  justification  code (UJC).  See Para  5.2.9 for  more  information  concerning  assignment  of  the  UJC.  The  FAD  is taken  from  the  customer  issue  request  (if  specified),  or the OCCR contained  in  the ILS-S.   See  Para  5.2.43 for  more  information  on  how  the  requisition  priority  is assigned  to requisitions  associated with  customer  (due-out) requirements.   See AFH 23-123, Pt  2,  Ch  8  for  more  information  concerning  storage  of  the  FAD  on  the OCCR in  the  ILS-S.   Stock 5.2.38.2.9.2.  Priority  assignment  for  stock  replenishment  requisitions. replenishment  requisitions  are  assigned  priorities  11  through  15  based  upon  the FAD loaded  for  each base at each  retail  Materiel  Management  Activity.   If  a stock replenishment  requisition  is produced, the systems  assigns  a “1”  in  the first  position of  the requisition  priority  designator,  and  the retail  Materiel  Management  Activit y (organizational)  FAD in  the  second position.   For example,  if  the  FAD equals  “2,” the  priority  designator  assigned  to stock  replenishment  requisitions  will  be “12.”   See  Para  5.2.43  for  more  information  and  specific  priority  assignments  for  the different  types  of stock  replenishment  requisitions.   See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 3, Ch 2 for more  information  on FAD assignment  in  the  ILS-S. 5.2.38.2.10.  Required  Delivery  Date (RDD).   The RDD serves  several  purposes.   First, it  specifies  the  actual  need date for the materiel  when  this  date is incompatible  with  the standard  delivery  date  (SDD)  assigned  for  each  priority  group.   In  this  situation,  the RDD  replaces  the  SDD  on  the  requisition Additionally,  the RDD identifies  Mission  Capable (MICAP) requirements;  requisit io ns submitted  after  the  effective  date of a mass  cancellation  action;  and requisitions  (other  than  MICAP)  which  require  priority  transportation.    Required  delivery  date  (RDD) codes 999 or N** identify  MICAP requisitions.   See Para  5.2.44 for more  informa t io n concerning  the  assignment  of required  delivery  dates to requisitions. to  expedite  transportation  movement.   5.2.38.2.11.  Project Code.  The  project code identifies  requisitions  that  require  special processing.   The  project  code is  also  used  for  accumulating  intra-service  performance and cost data related  to exercises,  maneuvers,  and other distinct  programs,  projects, and operations.    Project  codes  are  assigned  by  individual  Service,  and  DLA  for  DoD projects.    Additional  guidance  and  a  list  of  project  codes  authorized  for  Air  Force projects  are provided  in  AFH 23-123, Vol  1, Ch 2. 5.2.38.2.11.1.  Effect  of  project  codes  on  base  requisitions.    Project  codes,  other than  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  (OSD)  and  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  (JCS) project  codes,  do not  provide  or imply  any  priority  or  precedence  for  requisit io n processing.    Therefore,  other  types  of  project  codes  never  alter  or  override  the normal  priority  designators  assigned  to base requisitions.   ILS-S requisition  (A0*) transactions  that  contain  project codes will  be processed through  the LRS, Materiel AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 415 Management  Activity  or Transportation  Activity  channels  according  to the priority designator  as  prescribed  in  Uniform  Materiel  Movement  and  Issue  Priority Standard  (UMMIPS)  directives. 5.2.38.2.12.  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  (JCS)/Intra-Air  Force Project Code Policy.   The  Air Force has authorized  the use  of Joint  Chiefs  of Staff  (JCS) and Intra-Air  Force project codes  to  augment  repair  and  distribution  decisions  at  the  wholesale  level  of  supply.   The use of JCS (9**) and Intra-Air  Force (7**) project codes are restricted  to units  that are currently  assigned,  or may  be assigned,  a contingency  tasking.   JCS/Intra-Air  Force project  codes  are  assigned  to  selected  ILS-S  Readiness  Spares  Package  (RSP)  and Peacetime  Operating  Stock  (POS)  replenishment  requisition  (A0*)  transactions  that require  priority  management  attention.   In the ILS-S, JCS/Intra-Air  Force project codes are programmatically  assigned  to requisitions  via  assignment  of  a JCS Project  Flag. 5.2.38.2.12.1.  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  (JCS)  project  flag.   The  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff (JCS)  Project  Flag  serves  several  purposes.   First,  the  JCS project  flag  identifies units  either  engaged  or  preparing  to  engage  in  combat  air  operations,  or  units enforcing  a  “no-fly”  zone  within  an  established  resupply  pipeline  that  are  not actively  engaged  in  combat  air  operations. the  JCS  project  flag determines  the  amount  of  RSP or peacetime  operating  stock (POS) replenishme nt requisitions  (if  any)  which  will  contain  the  JCS project  code.    JCS project  flags assigned  to  stock  numbers  are  located  on  the  ILS-S  item  record  (101-Forecast-Acquisition-Cost)  and  displayed  on  the  item  record  inquiry  (JCS  Project).    JCS project flags  assigned  to RSP records are located  on the MRSP/IRSP  control  record (025-JCS-Proj-Flag).  The  JCS project  flag  is  authorized  and assigned  as described in  the  following  paragraphs.   Secondly, 5.2.38.2.12.1.1.  JCS project  flag  A.   JCS project  flag  A  is  authorized  for  use by units  engaged  in  combat  or where  combat  is  imminent.   JCS project flag  A indicates  100 percent  of  the  replenishment  requisition  (A0*)  transactions  for POS and/or  RSP  authorizations  are  authorized  a  JCS/Intra-Air  Force  project code.    JCS  project  flag  A  may  be  assigned  at  both  the  item  record  (stock number)  and RSP authorization  levels.   AF/A4LM  is  the approval  authority  for assignment  of JCS project  flag  A. 5.2.38.2.12.1.2.  JCS project flag  B.  JCS project flag  B is authorized  for use by units  that  are  not  actively  engaged,  but  preparing  to  engage  in  combat  air operations.   JCS project  flag  B indicates  that  50 percent  of the  RSP authorized quantity  may  be  requisitioned  with  JCS/Intra-Air  Force  project  codes.  Therefore,  each  RSP  replenishment  requisition transaction  produced  will contain  a JCS/Intra-Air  Force project code when  total  base assets (on-hand)  and JCS/Intra-Air  Force  project  coded due-in  (requisition)  quantities  are  less  than 50  percent  of  the  RSP  authorized  quantity. serviceable  balance;  MSK;  IRSP;  MRSP;  HPMSK;  WCDO;  special  spares; firm  due-in-from- maintenance  (DIFM);  and deployed  items.   Note:   When  50 percent  of the  RSP quantity  does not equal  a whole  number  (i.e.,  3/2 = 1 ½), the fractional  number  is  rounded  upward  to the  next  whole  number.   JCS project flag  ‘B’ is authorized  on airborne  and non-airborne  MRSP, IRSP, and HPMSK details.   However,  JCS  project  flag  B  is  not  authorized  for  assignment  at  the   Total  base  assets  include :   416 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 item  record  (stock  number)  level.    AF/A4LM  is  the  approval  authority  for assignment  of JCS project  flag  B. 5.2.38.2.12.1.3.  JCS project  flag  C. JCS project  flag  C is  authorized  for  use by units  that  are not actively  engaged  in  combat  air  operations;  however,  are enforcing  a no-fly  zone  within  an  established  resupply  pipeline.  When  JCS project  flag  C is  authorized,  the  next  requisition  after  a stock-out  condition will  contain  a JCS/Intra-Air  Force  project  code. JCS  Project  Flag  C flag  is  authorized  at  both  the  item  record  (stock  number)  and  readiness  spares package (RSP) authorization  levels.   Assignment  of the ‘C’ flag  is authorized, up to but  not earlier  than  30 days before  the scheduled  deployment.  The  base or AFMC is the  approval  authority  for assignment  of  JCS project flag  C. 5.2.38.2.12.1.4.  JCS  project  flag  Z.  JCS  project  flag  Z  is  programmatica l ly assigned  to  the  item  record  whenever  a  CPF  is  processed  to  blank  the  item record JCS project  flag  and  a WRM-IRSP-SPARES-DETAIL  exists.  Also  the JCS project  flag  Z will  be assigned  when  a WRM-IRSP-SPARES-DETAIL  is created and the  item  record has  no flag  assigned. 5.2.38.2.12.1.5.  Flexible  Consumable Item  Readiness  Spares  Packages (FCRSP).    The  authorized  unsupportable  quantity  field  in  the  WCDO  detail must  be  considered  when  calculating  the  quantity  to  receive  the  JCS  project code on  all  requisitions.   To distinguish  FCRSP items  from  true  unsupportable quantities  FCRSP items  must  have  a work unit  code of “FCRSP”  loaded  on the detail  and  the  FCRSP quantity  loaded  on  the  unsupportable  quantity  and  this quantity  will  always  be assumed  to be on hand. 5.2.38.2.12.2.  Determination  of  JCS  authorized  requisition  quantity.    The  JCS authorized  requisition  quantity  represents  the  total  (by  stock  number)  requisit io n quantity  authorized  a JCS/Intra-Air  Force project  code.  The  ILS-S calculates  the JCS requisition  quantity  authorized  a JCS/Intra-Air  Force project  code as follows :   [Portion  of  Total  Base  Need  Authorized  a  JCS/Intra-Air  Force  Project  Code  – (Total  Base Assets)]    If the  result  of  the above calculation  is positive  (greater  than zero),  the  difference  between  the  portion  of  the  total  base  need  authorized  a JCS/Intra-Air  Force project code and total  base assets will  be assigned  a JCS/intra -Air  Force  project  code.  If  the  result  of  the  above  calculation  is  negative  (zero  or less),  the  difference  represents  the  number  of  requisitions  currently  containing  a JCS/Intra-Air  Force  project  code  that  should  not  have  one  assigned.   The application  of the  above formula  is  depicted  in  Figure  5.5. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 417 Figure  5.5.  Determination  of JCS Authorized  Requisition  Quantity. Table 5.46.

Figure  5.6  provides  an illustration  of  how the  ILS-S applies  the  JCS authorized  requisition  quantity. Figure  5.6.  Application  of JCS Authorized  Requisition  Quantity.  5.2.38.2.12.4.  JCS project flag  and JCS/intra-Air  Force project code load,  change, and  delete  (CPF) transaction.   LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel  are authorized  to load  JCS project  flags  A and C to stock numbers  (item  records),  and JCS project  flags  A,  B,  and  C, to  ILS-S  MRSP  and  IRSP  control  records.    CPF transactions  are used  to assign  JCS project  codes and project  flags  to item  records.  1EB  transactions  are  used  to  assign  JCS  project  codes  and  flags  to  IRSP/MRSP records.    See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  3  for  additional  information  about  1EB transactions.     See Para  5.2.61 for  format  and  processing  instructions  for  the JCS Project  Flag  and  JCS/Intra-Air  Force project  code load,  change,  and  delete  (CPF) transaction.   If  the  stock number  is  part of  an Interchangeable  & Substitute  Group (ISG),  the  ILS-S will  automatically  assign  the  JCS project  flag  and  JCS/Intra- Air Force  project  code  to  the  master  (M)  and  all  interchangeable  (I)  coded  stock numbers  in  the group.   However,  for  bachelor  items  and substitute  (S) coded items, the  retail  system  will  assign  the  JCS project  flag  and  JCS/Intra-Air  Force  project code  to  the  input  stock  number  only.  Note:      Both  the  JCS  project  flag  and JCS/Intra-Air  Force project  code must  be assigned  to the  ILS-S item  record or the CPF transaction  will  reject. 5.2.38.2.12.5.  Replenishment  requisition  -  POS  level  requirements.    The  ILS-S will  assign  the JCS project code to the item  record and the replenishment  requisit io n AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 419 (A0*) transaction  when  authorized.    The  JCS project code assigned  to requisit io ns is  dependent  upon  the  specific  flag  assigned. 5.2.38.2.12.5.1.  Replenishment  requisition  -  RSP  level  requirements.    If  an RSP  or  HPMSK  requires  replenishment  requisitioning  with  a  JCS/Intra- Air Force  project  code,  the  ILS-S  assigns  the  JCS/Intra-Air  Force  project  code assigned  to the MRSP/IRSP  serial  number  control  record applicable  to the RSP authorization  being  replenished.   The  ILS-S  creates  a  requisition  (A0*) transaction  (with  the  corresponding  RSP (MRSP/IRSP/HPMSK)  JCS/Intra- Air Force project code) with  a requisition  quantity  to bring  the on-hand  quantity  up to  the  JCS  authorized  level  quantity.   Concurrently,  the  ILS-S  will  create another  requisition  and  due-in  detail  and  requisition  (A0*)  transaction  for  the remaining  replenishment  quantity  required  with  the  appropriate  RSP  project code  (122, 123, 3AA).    Note:    Replenishment  requisitions  for  JCS/Intra- Air Force project codes and flags  created for ERRCD  XD* items  will  always  be for a quantity  of one (1), regardless  of the due-out  detail  quantity. requisition  quantity.   Replenishment  requisitions 5.2.38.2.12.5.2.  Replenishment  requisition  –  remaining  requirements  above the  JCS  authorized for requisition  quantities  required  above  the  JCS  authorized  requisition  quantity, but  less  than  the  total  base requirement,  will  not  contain  a JCS/Intra-Air  Force project code.  Replenishment  requisitions  for ERRCD XB*or XF* items  are not restricted  to a quantity  of  one.    Therefore,  the  requisition  quantity  is  not  split between  separate  requisition  (A0*)  transactions.   Instead,  the  ILS-S assigns  a JCS/Intra-Air  Force  project  code,  even  when  the  total  required  requisit io n quantity  is  above the  authorized  JCS authorized  requisitioning  level. 5.2.38.2.12.6.  Batch  update  of  JCS/intra-Air  Force  project  codes.  In  some cases, JCS project flags  and JCS/Intra-Air  Force project codes must  be changed. For example,  AF/A4LR  approves  the  assignment  of JCS project  flag  A or B, a local  decision  is  made  to  assign  JCS  project  flag  C, or  AF/A4LR  directs  the removal  of  assigned  JCS project  flag  A  or B.  When  JCS project  flags  require modification  (load/change/delete),  a  batch  program  must  be  processed.  The the  JCS  project  flags  and R76  (NGV775)  is  the  process  used  to  modify JCS/Intra-Air  Force  project  codes  on  replenishment (A0*) transactions.  The  R76 is  an  “as- required”  program  that  reviews  existing  stock and RSP replenishment  due-ins  to determine  if  any should  be upgraded  to a JCS project  code or downgraded  from  the JCS project code. The  R76 program  will format  due-in  updates  (DIT  transactions)  that  will  upgrade/downgrade  due-ins/requisitions.  The WRM section  must  notify  AFMC to schedule  and process the  R76.  See  AFH  23-123  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  6  for  specific  instructions  for processing  the  R76. requisition 5.2.38.2.13.  Requisition  Advice  Code.   The  requisition  advice  code  indicates  to  the source  of supply  a specific  condition  is required  to ensure  a desired  supply  result.   For example,  requisition  advice  code 2B (do not substitute)  informs  the source  of supply  to provide  the  requested  item  only  or cancel  the  requisition.   Requisition  advice  code 2D (exact  quantity)  informs  the  source  of  supply  to  furnish  the  exact  quantity  requested 420 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 only  or cancel  the requisition.   See Para  5.2.45 for a list  and explanation  of requisit io n advice  codes available  for use.  Additionally,  processing  instructions  are also provided.  5.2.39.  Requisition  Cost, Quantity,  And Quantity  Unit Pack (QUP)  Edits And Processing Instructions. 5.2.39.1.  Purpose.    To  describe  how  the  ILS-S  applies  requisition  cost,  quantity,  and quantity  unit  pack (QUP) edits  to base requisition  (A0*) transactions. 5.2.39.2.  Requisition  Quantity  and  Cost  Edits  for  Supply  Items.   The  requisition  (A0*) transaction  DIC may  be assigned  based upon  ILS-S cost and quantity  edits.   The  following items  or conditions  will  cause the ILS-S to change  the requisition  document  identifier  code (DIC)  to  “A0E”  for  CONUS bases  or “A05”  for  OCONUS bases.  The  ILS-S enters  the letters  QTY in  positions  68-70 of the  output  requisition  (A0*) transaction. 5.2.39.3.  Requisition  Quantity  and Cost Edits  for  Equipment  Items.   Normally,  when  the ILS-S produces  a requisition  for  an  equipment  item,  it  also  checks  to see if  the  quantity  is reasonable.    The  system  will  not  do  a  reasonable  quantity  check  for  items  containing  a blank  budget  code (AFMC investment  items)  or budget  codes A-H, J-U, or W-X.  Stock fund  dollars  are not  utilized  for  these  items  so quantity  or cost edits  are not  performed.   If an  equipment item  (ERRCD  N**)  costs  more  than  $999.99,  the  ILS-S  changes  the document  identifier  code (DIC)  to A0E  for  CONUS bases or to A05 for  OCONUS bases and places  three  dollar  signs  ($$$) in  positions  68-70 of the  requisition. 5.2.39.4.  Processing  Requisitions  with  Cost and/or  Quantity  Edits.  AFMC will  ensure the requisition  quantity  and cost are correct. If correct, manually  blank  positions  68-70, change  the  document  identifier  code (DIC) as required,  and send the  requisition  (A0*) transaction  to the  source  of  supply.   For  example,  change  the  DIC to A0A  (CONUS) or  A01  (OCONUS) for  stock  number  requisitions  as  applicable.  If  QTY  appears  in positions  68-70, Stock Control  will  ensure  the  quantity  is  valid.  If valid,  Stock Control will  enter  advice  code  2L  in  positions  65-66  and  blank  positions  68-80.  The  2L requisition  advice  code will  prevent  DLA maximum  release  quantity  (MRQ) edits from incorrectly  canceling  requisitions  with  a valid  quantity  using  status  code  CS. Status code  CS indicates  that  requisition  quantities  appear  to  be  invalid  or  excessive.    See Para  5.2.88 for  more information. 5.2.39.5.  Quantity  and Cost Edits  for  Customer  Due-Out  (UND A/B)  Requirements.   The following  explains  QUP  processing  concerning  due-out  requirements  containing  budget code 9. 5.2.39.5.1.  Requisition  Advice  Code Other  Than  2D, 2N, 34, and  Blank.   If  the  due-out  detail  contains  a requisition  advice  code other  than  2D, 2N, 34, or blank,  the  QUP will  be applied  to due-out  requirements  with  budget  code 9 (UND A and B).  The  ILS-S will  increase  the  requisition  quantity  to a quantity  equally  divisible  by the  quantity unit  pack on the  output  requisition  (A0*)  transaction.   Table  5.47 provides  examples of how  ILS-S requisitions  are adjusted  by quantity  unit  pack edits. 5.2.39.5.2.  Requisition  Advice  Code  2D,  2N, 34,  and  Blank.    If  the  due-out  detail contains  advice  code  2D  or  blank,  or  if  the  quantity  is  not  equally  divisible  by  the quantity  unit  pack, the ILS-S requisitions  the due-out  quantity  and assigns  advice  code 2D to the output  requisition  (A0*) transaction.   If the due-out detail  contains  requisit io n AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 421 advice  codes 2N or 34, the  ILS-S requisitions  the due-out  quantity  and applies  the due-out advice  code to the output  requisition  (A0*) transaction. 5.2.39.5.3.  Stock  Replenishment  Quantity  Unit  Pack  (QUP)  Processing.    For  stock replenishment  requisitions  (including  due-out  requirements  with  UND  C), the  ILS-S adjusts  the  requisition  quantity  to  a  quantity  equally  divisible  by  the  QUP.    If  the requisition  quantity  is  less  than  50  percent  of  the  QUP,  the  required  quantity is requisitioned.   If  the  required  quantity  is  greater  than  50 percent  of  the  QUP, but  less than  one unit  pack, the requisition  quantity  is adjusted  to one unit  pack.  The remaining requisition  quantity,  if  any, is adjusted  to the next  nearest quantity  unit  pack, unless  one of the  following  conditions  exists: 5.2.39.5.3.1.  The  remainder  is less  than  50 percent  of  one quantity  unit  pack. 5.2.39.5.3.2.  The  requisition  objective  (RO)  has  been  adjusted  by  a  minim um adjusted  stock  level  (ASL).   See  AFMAN  23-122, Sec  2B,  Stock Procedures  for more  information  concerning  the RO and minimum  ASLs. 5.2.39.5.3.3.  The  requisition  quantity  adjustment  exceeds  one  year's  requireme nt.   Table 5.47 shows how the ILS-S uses the quantity  unit  pack to adjust requisitio ning quantities. Table 5.47.  Quantity  Unit  Pack Requisition  Quantity  Adjustment. Required Quantity 30 38 56 1 Quantity  Unit  Pack Quantity 36 36 36 100 Adjusted Requisition Quantity 36 36 72 1 5.2.39.6.  Quantity  and  Cost  Edits  for  Customer  Due-Out  (UND  C)  Requirements.    For UND C requirements  when  the requisition  objective  (RO) is either  zero or greater  than  the product  of  the  (DDR)  times  365, the  ILS-S will  not  apply  the  quantity  unit  pack.  Rather, the output  requisition  (A0*) transaction  or fund  requirement  (FRC) image  will  contain  the requisitioned  quantity  (not  adjusted  by the  QUP) and requisition  advice  code 2D. 5.2.39.7.  Quantity  Unit  Pack  (QUP)  Policy  for  Slow-Moving  Items.    Air  Force  policy specifies  the  use of  quantity  unit  pack (QUP) quantities  whenever  possible.   However,  for some  slow-moving items,  an  automated  QUP  requisition  quantity  adjustment  could produce  requisitions  that  exceed  base requirements.   Slow-moving  items  whose  quantity should  not  be automatically  adjusted  to  the  nearest  QUP require  assignment  of  a locally-determined  requisition  exception  (REX)  code  to  the  item,  and  a  requisition  exception phrase  record (override)  containing  requisition  advice  code 2D and exception  notice  code (ENC) P.  A combination  of these actions  will  stop the ILS-S from  adjusting  the requisit io n quantity  to the QUP.  See Para  5.2.45 for  more  information  concerning  requisition  advice codes.    See  Ch  5  for  more  information  concerning  REX  codes  and  exception  phrase records. 422 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.2.40.  Requisition  Serial Number  Assignment. 5.2.40.1.  Purpose.

To  explain  automated  demand  code  assignment  on  ILS-S  output requisition  (A0*)  transactions  and  provide  guidance  for  assigning  requisition  demand codes to manual  (offline)  requisition  transactions. 5.2.42.1.1.  Demand  Codes Assigned  to Automated  (Inline)  Requisitions.   If left  blank, the ILS-S programmatically  assigns  the requisition  demand  code to output  (automated) requisition  (A0*)  transactions  as explained  in  Table 5.51. Table 5.51.  Demand  Codes Assigned to System Output  Requisitions. Code Explanation 424 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 N Nonrecurring Demand.  One-time  requirement  or initial  request  for O P R stockage.   The  ILS-S considers  demand  code N requisitions  as non-recurring  demands.   The customer  demand  should  not be included  in  RO computations. Nonrecurring Demand.  A request  to identify  initial  sized  clothing  and war reserve  materiel  (WRM) requirements  to the  wholesaler.   Applies  to Federal  Supply  Group  (FSG) 83 and 84.  Note:   Not applicable  to Federal Supply  Class  8475.  Demand  code O should  be used only  on the first special  requisition  for  sized  clothing. Nonrecurring Demand for Special Program Requirements.  A request  for special  program  or special  requirement  items  previously  stocked by the ICP.   Recurring  Demand.  An  item  periodically  required  by the  customer.   The requested  items  will  be for  bench  stock consumption,  active  requirements, or stock replenishment.

Requisition  Priority  Designator Assignment. 5.2.43.1.  Purpose.   To explain  the  procedures  used  by the  ILS-S to determine  and assign requisition  priority  designators  to requisitions.   The  ILS-S  assigns  requisit io n 5.2.43.2.  Requisition  Priority  Designator  Assignment. priority  designators  based  upon  Uniform  Materiel  Movement  and  Issue  Priority  System (UMMIPS)  standards.   This  paragraph  provides  an  overall  picture  of  the  factors  used  to determine  the correct requisition  priority,  and processing  time  standards  for all  elements  of the  requisition  pipeline. 5.2.43.2.1.  Priority  Designator  Assignment  for  Due-Out  Requisitions.    The  priority designator  assigned  to  ILS-S  requisitions  for  due-out  requirements)  depends  on  two AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 425 elements:   the  urgency  of need designator  (UND) and force  activity  designator  (FAD).  The  UND is  the  first  position  of the  customer  issue  request  urgency  justification  code (UJC).   The  FAD  is  taken  from  one  of  the  following:   1)  the  issue  request,  or 2)  the organizational  cost  center  record  (OCCR) if  the  FAD  is  blank  on  the  customer  issue request. 5.2.43.2.2.  Priority  Designator  Assignment  for  Stock  Replenishment  Requisitio ns.   Stock replenishment  requisitions  are normally  assigned  requisition  priority  designators 11 through  15 based on the FAD loaded in  the base constants  record (AFH 23-123, Vol 2,  Pt  3,  Ch  6).    The  ILS-S  assigns  the  requisition  priority  to  stock  replenishme nt requisitions  as follows: 5.2.43.2.2.1.  First  Position  (position  60).  The  ILS-S places  a constant  1 in  the first position  of the requisition  priority  designator. 5.2.43.2.2.2.  Second Position  (position  61).  The  ILS-S determines  the  FAD code from  the  ILS-S Base  Constants  record and places  it  in  the  second (last)  position  of the  requisition  priority  designator  on  the output  requisition  (A0*) transaction.   For example,  if  the base FAD code is 2, the stock replenishment  requisition  priority  will be 12. 5.2.43.2.3.  Priority  Designator  Assignment   ILS-S requisitions  for  deferred  requirements  (special  projects,  pre-positioned,  war  reserve) will  contain  requisition  priority  designator  99 in  positions  60-61. for  Deferred  Requirements. 5.2.43.2.4.  Other  Priority  Designator  Assignment for  Stock  Replenishme nt Requisitions.   The  ILS-S assigns  requisition  priority  designators  other  than  11-15 for stock replenishment  requisitions  as follows: 5.2.43.2.4.1.  Priority  Designator  05.    Priority  designator  05 is  programmatica l ly assigned  to IRSP off-set  quantity  stock replenishment  requisitions. 5.2.43.2.4.2.  Priority  Designator  06.    Priority  designator  06 is  programmatica l ly assigned  to stock replenishment  requisitions  if  the  item  contains  a shelf  life  code of (A-F)  or  is  designated  an  airlift  investment  item.    Additionally,  the  quantity  of requisitioned  items  must  be less  than  the  Reorder  Point  (ROP)  and the  quantity  of assets  on  hand  is  less  than  the  computed  safety  level.   See  AFMAN  23-122, Sec 2B,  Stockage  Procedure  for  more  information  concerning  the  computation  of  the ROP  and  safety  level.    The  ILS-S  assigns  requisition  priority  designator  06 automatically  to other types  of  items  as explained  in  the  following  paragraphs: 5.2.43.2.4.2.1.  Air  Force Critical  Items.   If  the  item  is  designated  an Air  Force critical  item  (RAMPS  report  code  5 or  7),  the  ILS-S  automatically  assigns  a minimum (A0*) transactions. requisition  priority  designator  06  to  output  requisition 5.2.43.2.4.2.2.  DELETED 5.2.43.2.4.3.  Priority  Designator  08.    Priority  designator  08 is  programmatica l ly assigned  to requisitions  that  qualify  for RDD 777 and project code 780 or 880 when the  computed  supply  priority  is  greater  than  08  (09-15).    Qualified  requisit io ns include  those  for  ERRCD  XD*  when  the  budget  code equals  8, O, S, T,  U, W or 426 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 X;  ERRCD  XF3 with   budget  code 8 or 9, and  the  101-Hazardous-Materiel-Code is  blank;  and ERRCD  XB* or XF* items,  with  budget  code 8 or 9, that  qualify  for fast  transportation in  accordance  with  AFMAN  23-122,  Sec  2B,  Stockage Procedure.   See Para  5.2.44 for  more information  about  RDD 777 assignment. 5.2.43.2.4.4.  Priority  Designator  09.    Priority  designator  09 is  programmatica l ly assigned  to  stock  replenishment  requisitions  if  the  item   is   (ERRCD  XD*/XF*).   Additionally,  there  are no assets on hand,  and the  item  or group  of interchangeab le items  has had a total  of six  or more  demands  during  the last  five  (5) quarters. 5.2.44.  Required  Delivery Date (RDD) Assignment,  Usage, and  Processing Instructions. 5.2.44.1.  Purpose.   To  list  and  explain  the  assignment of  the  RDD  on  ILS-S requisit io ns for  both  customer  (due-out)  and  stock  replenishment  (due-in)  requirements.   Usage information  and processing  instructions  is  also provided. 5.2.44.2.  Required  Delivery  Date (RDD).   The RDD  is used to specify  the actual  need date of  the  requirement  requisitioned  when  incompatible  with  the  Standard  Delivery  Date (SDD).    Additionally, to  the LRS/transportation  activity.   General  RDD  assignment  and usage  on ILS-S requisitions  is as follows: the  RDD  provides  expedite  movement instructions 5.2.44.2.1.  RDD 999.  RDD 999 indicates  expedited  handling  requirement  for Mission Capable  (MICAP)  Non-Mission  Capable  Supply  (NMCS)  requirement  from  an overseas  (OCONUS) customer. 5.2.44.2.2.  RDD  N**.    RDD  N**  indicates  expedited  handling  due  to  NMCS requirement  from  a stateside  (CONUS) customer.   The  last  two positions  of the  RDD will  contain  the  urgency  justification  code  from  the  customer  issue  request.    For example,  a  CONUS  MICAP  requisition  for  aircraft  will  normally  contain  required delivery  date (RDD)  NAA. 5.2.44.2.3.  RDD  E**.    RDD  E**  indicates  expedited  handling  due  to  anticipated NMCS engine  requirement  from  a CONUS customer. 5.2.44.2.4.  RDD  555.  RDD  555 indicates  expedited  handling  due to mass  requisit io n cancellation  requirements  from  a CONUS customer. 5.2.44.2.5.  RDD  444.    RDD  444  indicates  expedited  handling for  customer requirements  co-located with  the storage  activity,  or for locally  negotiated  requireme nt dated requirements. 5.2.44.2.6.  RDD  Blank.   A blank  RDD  indicates  routine  transportation  handling. 5.2.44.2.7.  RDD  777.  RDD  777 is  used to identify  requisitions  authorized  expedited transportation  handling  at the  source  of supply.   This  RDD  is  assigned  to requisit io ns by  the  ILS-S  when  any  of  the  conditions  listed  in  the  following  paragraphs  are  met.   Note:     ILS-S  requisitioning  program  logic  will  automatically  blank  the  RDD  if  an attempt  is  made  to  manually  assign  RDD  777 for  requisitions  that  do not  meet  RDD 777 assignment  criteria. 5.2.44.2.7.1.  DELETED 5.2.44.2.7.2.  RDD  777 and Project  Code 880.  RDD 777 may  be used  with  project AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 427 code  880  for  ILS-S  requisitions.    Project  code  880  normally  identifies  AFMC-managed  (ERRCD  XD*/XF*/XB*)  assets  that  do  not  meet  any  other  criteria  for assignment  of RDD  777 as explained  in  the  following  paragraphs. 5.2.44.2.7.2.1.  RDD  777  and  project  code  880  will  be  programmatica l ly assigned to  output  requisition  (A0*)  transactions  automatically  when  the ERRCD  is  XD*,  the  budget  code  equals  8,  O,  S,  T,  U,  W  or  X,  and  the requisition  does not meet  any  other  edit  criteria  for assignment  of RDD  of 777. 5.2.44.2.7.2.2.  RDD  777  and  project  code  880  will  be  programmatica l ly assigned to  the  backorder  output  requisition  (A0*)  transaction  when  the ERRCD  is  XF3,  the  budget  code  equals  8  or  9,  and  the  101-Hazardous-Materiel-Code  is  blank. 5.2.44.2.7.2.3.  RDD  777  and  project  code  880  will  be  programmatica l ly assigned  to the OCONUS AWP backorder output  requisition  (A0*) transactions when  the  ERRCD  is  XB3,  the  budget  code  equals  8  or  9,  and  the101-Hazardous-Materiel-Code  is  blank. 5.2.44.2.7.2.4.  RDD 777 and project code 780.  RDD 777 and project code 780 will  be  programmatically  assigned  to  stock  replenishment  output  requisit io n (A0*) transactions  when  the ILS-S item  record (101) FAST-TRANS-DENIAL-CODE position  is ”F”,  the  ERRCD  is  XB* or XF*, and the  budget  code equals 8 or 9.  See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 2B, Stockage  Procedure  for details  about  the assignment  of the  fast  transportation  denial  code. 5.2.44.2.7.3.  RDD  777 will  be programmatically  assigned  to stock  replenishme nt requisitions  if  the  item  contains  a shelf  life  code of  (A-F) or is designated  an airlift investment  item.   Additionally,  the quantity  of requisitioned  items  must  be less  than the  ROP and the quantity  of assets  on hand  is less  than  the computed  safety  level. 5.2.44.3.  RDD  for  Lateral  Support  Requisitions.   For  non-MICAP  lateral  support requisitions  (RIC  equals  D**  ) supporting  customer  due-out  requirements,  the  RDD  will consist  of  the force  activity  designator  (FAD)  and the UJC from  the due-out  detail. 5.2.44.4.  RDD  Incompatible  with  Standard  Delivery  Date (SDD).   When  the  RDD  is  not consistent  with  the  standard  delivery  date  (SDD)  of  the  UMMIPS  priority  group,  the required  delivery  date may  be used  on  requisitions.   If  the  RDD  is  earlier  than  the  SDD, the  actual  required  delivery  date  indicated  on  the  issue  request  will  be  entered  on  the requisition. 5.2.44.5.  RDD  for Long  Lead-Time  Requirements.   Some items,  such  as those  required  at a future  date or for  support  of special  projects  and programs,  may  be requisitioned  well  in advance  of  the  actual  RDD.    Output  requisition for  items  not immediately  required  must  contain  the following  information: (A0*)  transactions 5.2.44.5.1.  Extended  RDD.  The extended  RDD is used to show  the number  of months required  for  the lead  time.   The  extended  RDD will  consist  of  an X in  the first  position and the number  of months  lead  time  required  in  the last  two positions.   For example,  if the  extended  RDD  is  24 months  from  the  date identified  in  the  requisition  document number  date  field,  the  RDD  will  contain  X24.    For sources  of  supply,  the  extended 428 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 RDD  will  always  depict  the  last  day  of the  last  month  when  the  item  is  required.   For example,  an  item  required  on  Note:   The  extended  RDD  for  requisitions  supporting initial  support  of  weapon  systems  or  equipment  must  contain  X03.    Initial  Spares Support  List  (ISSL)  Major Command  Spares Support List  (MSSL),  and Non-Airborne Spares Support List  (NASSL)  requisition  requirements  apply. 5.2.44.5.2.  RDD and Specific  Shipment  Release  Date.  In some cases, bases may  desire shipments  to be held  until  50 days  prior  to the RDD.   The  RDD  will  consist  of  an S in the  first  position  and  the  number  of  months  remaining  until  the  estimated  Shipment Release  Date.  For example,  RDD S02 will  indicate  the materiel  is required  two months from  the  requisition  date. 5.2.45.  Requisition  Advice Codes. 5.2.45.1.  Purpose.    To  identify  and  explain  requisition  advice  codes  used  on  ILS-S requisitions.   The  requisition  advice  code is  used  to notify  the  source  of supply  of  specific processing  instructions  required  for  submitted  requisition  (A0*)  transactions.   See  Table  5.53 for  more  information  concerning  requisition  advice  codes. 5.2.45.1.1.  Equipment  Investment  Items.   Every  requisition  (A0*)  transaction  created for  Air  Force investment  equipment  (ERRCD  ND*/NF*) items  must  have  the  correct advice  code. 5.2.45.1.2.  DIT  Input.    To  change  a  requisition  advice  code,  use  a  due-in/due- out update  (DIT)  input.   See  Para  5.2.71  for  the  DIT  transaction  format  and  processing instructions. Table 5.53.  Requisition  Advice  Codes. Code 2A 2B Description The  item  cannot  be obtained  locally  through  manufacture,  fabrication,  or procurement.   If  the item  record contains  requisition  exception  code 2, the ILS-S automatically  assigns  requisition  advice  code 2A to the  requisition. Do not substitute  or interchange  - only  the  requested  item  will  do.  This instruction  also  applies  to obsolete  items  which  were previously  rejected with  status  code CJ.  If  the ISU input  transaction  contains  TEX  code T, the ILS-S automatically  assigns  requisition  advice  code 2B. 2C Do not back order.  Reject  the unfilled  quantity  that  is not  available  by the RDD.   Fill  or kill. 2D 2E 2F Furnish  the exact  quantity  requested.   Do not adjust  to quantity  unit  pack. Free issue.   Stock lists  and other  publications  offer  this  materiel  without reimbursement.    The  item  has  been coded obsolete,  but  still  required  for  immediate  use.  A Service-approved  substitute  is  acceptable.   If  the  supply  source  cannot procure  the item,  reject the  requisition  with  status  code CJ. 2G Multiple  use: (1)  Ship  new  stocks or stocks having  new appearance. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 429 (2)  Strategic  mission  requires  newest  and  latest  model  and configuration (electron  tubes). (3)  Strategic  mission  requires  newest  stock only  (photographic  materiel). (4)  Anticipated  use  requires  latest  expiration  dates only  (biological). 2H Multiple  use: (1)  Special  textile  requirements  for  use in  airborne  operations. (2)  Commissary  resale  item. Do not substitute  or back order.  Fill  or kill. The  item  is  being  requisitioned  from  CONUS pursuant  to the  Balance  of Payments  program.   Note:   Only  overseas  (OCONUS) retail  materiel management  activities  may  use requisition  advice  code 2K. The  quantity  shown  in  the quantity  field  exceeds  normal  demands; however,  this  is  a confirmed  requirement. 2J 2K 2L 2M This  requisition  is  submitted  on a fill  or kill  basis  for  items  located  in DLADS  and advertised  by DLADS.   Items  in  equal  or better condition than  the code in  positions  21-22 are acceptable.   However,  if  the requisitioner  and DLADS  have  agreed about  the condition  of materiel acceptable  to the  requisitioner,  the  two-position  condition  code will  not be required. 2N The  item  is  required  in  one continuous  length  (positions  25-29) and unit  of issue  (positions  23-24).  Other arrangements  and/or multiples  of the quantity  unit  packs are not  acceptable. 2P The  item  is  required  in  one continuous  length  (positions  25-29) and the unit  of issue  (positions  23-24).  If  the requirement  exceeds the  quantity  unit pack length,  multiples  of the  quantity  unit  pack are acceptable. 2T Deliver  the  item  to the  ultimate  consignee  by  the Standard  Delivery  Date 6A 6B 6C 6D 6E (SDD),  or Required  Delivery  Date (RDD)  listed  on the  requisition.   Otherwise,  cancel  the requisition. Request  shipment  of  reparable  material.   Fill  or kill.   See Note. Request  shipment  of  Technical  Order Compliance  (TOC) materiel.   Fill  or kill.   See Note. If  the supply  source  cannot  guarantee  the item  will  be available  before  the priority  or required  delivery  date has expired,  reject  the requisition  and provide  a supply  source that  will  have  the item  available  for  the requisitioner  to buy.   Base funds  will  purchase  the item.   See Note. Request  for shipment  of incomplete  (INC) materiel.   Fill  or kill.   See Note. The  item  is  required  to replace  an item  lost  to the  equipment,  that  is, Inventory  Adjustment  Document  (IAD),  and other  relief  of accountability documents.   See Note. 430 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 6F The  item  is  required  for  issue  to a non-EAID  reporting  function  or agency; that  is,  CE real  property,  bench  mockup,  training  device,  or other governmental  agencies,  NASA, Army,  Navy,  etc., and  contractors.   This code applies  only  to P activity  code requests.   See Note. The  item  is  required  to replace  a TA authorization  (EAID).   This  code is used only  if  the equipment  item  in-use  is  turned  in  and is  no longer reported to AFEMS as in-use.   If the  replacement  item  which  is being ordered must  be received  before  the  in-use  item  can  be turned  in,  use advice  codes 6R or 6S instead.   Use this  code only  with  demand  code R.  See Note. The  item  is  required  to fill  a shortage  that  resulted  from  an increase  in authorization  in  the Allowance  Standard  (AS).  Use this  code only  with demand  code I.  See Note. 6G 6H 6J The  item  is  required  to fill  an  added authorization  to the Allowance 6K 6L 6Q 6R 6S Standard  (AS).  Use this  code only  with  Demand  Code I.  See Note. The  item  is  required  for  an Awaiting  Parts (AWP) end item.   See Note. The  item  is  required  for  an Awaiting  Parts (AWP) end item  (not to be killed).   See Note. The  item  is  required  for  calibration,  repair,  and return.    A complete  overhaul  of  an ERRCD  ND* item  is required  to check performance,  safety,  and efficiency.   Before  the item  can be released  for the  overhaul,  the replacement  item  must  be available.   See Note. Repair  costs for an ERRCD  NF* item  exceed economic  repair requirements.   Because  of operational  requirements,  the item  in  use  cannot be condemned  before  the replacement  is received.   See  Note. 6X If  the lateral  support  base cannot  provide  the  item,  it  back-orders the item from  the  source of  supply.   The  ILS-S uses this  advice  code for  lateral support  requisitioning  only.   See Note. Fill  or backorder the requested  quantity  and update  cumulative  recurring demands  at the  lateral  support  base.  Applies  to Economic  Order Quantity (EOQ) items  only.   See NOTE. This  item  is  required  to replace  a routed  repair  item.   Applies  to Depot Materiel  Management  activities  only.   Order Fill  or Kill.

Requisitions  are processed by the supporting  base as a fill  or pass, and shipments  are processed  to zero  balance.   See  Note. Note:  These  requisition  advice  codes may  be assigned  for  intra-Air  Force transaction use only.  Other Services  (Army/Navy/Marines)  will  not  recognize  Air  Force requisition  advice  codes.  It is  mandatory  to use the  correct advice  code on requisitions  for equipment  items  (ERRCD  ND*/NF*). 5.2.46.  Uniform  Materiel Movement And  Issue Priority  Standards  (UMMIPS). 5.2.46.1.  Purpose.    This  explains  how  Uniform  Materiel  Movement  and  Issue  Priority Standards  (UMMIPS)  are  used  to  determine  processing  time  and  establish  baselines  for each  segment  of  the  requisition  pipeline.    UMMIPS  standards  are  normally  based  upon requisition  priority  designator,  Required  Delivery  Date (RDD),  and base location. 5.2.46.2.

Priority  Designator  01-03 and RDD 999 for  Non Mission  Capable  Supply  (NMCS) Requisitions  and Shipments.   The  following  UMMIPS standards  are used to determine processing  time  for  each segment  of  the Mission  Capable (MICAP)  requisition  pipeline.   UMMIPS time  standards  for  MICAP requirements  are based upon  requisition  priority designator,  base location,  and RDD. Figure  5.8.  PD 01-03 NMCS and  RDD 999 for Requisitions  and Shipments. 5.2.47.  Requisition  Exception  (REX) Codes. 5.2.47.1.  Purpose.   To  list  and  explain  REX  codes  used  in  the  ILS-S to  suppress  and/or modify  automatic  requisitions. 5.2.47.2.  REX  Code Assignment  Criteria.   REX  codes are a one-position,  alpha/nume r ic code assigned  to stock numbers  to restrict  or modify  output  requisition  (A0*) transactions.    436 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 Requisition  exception  codes  and  requisition  exception  phrase  records  are  loaded  and assigned  as  outlined  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  8.    Note:      The  retail  Materiel Management  Activity  function  responsible  for  monitoring  each  REX  code  must  prepare and maintain  an exception  control  (ECC) image  for  each item  when  required.   REX  codes may  be manually  loaded,  changed,  or deleted  with  a stock control  data (FCD) transaction.   See Ch  2 for format  and processing  instructions  for  FCD transactions. 5.2.47.3.  Suppress  Automatic  Requisitioning.  REX  codes  1, 3,  and  4 will  cause  the ILS- S to suppress  requisition  (A0*)  transactions,  regardless  of the  assigned  exception notice  code (ENC).  However,  requisitions  are  suppressed  for  all  REX-coded  items  if ENC R  (Reject)  is  assigned.  REX  codes  are  also  used  to  identify  requisitions  which require  external  management  review  before  submission.  Assignment  of  ENC  P (Process)  to the  REX  exception  phrase  record  will  cause  the  ILS-S to  enter  the  REX code in  position  71 of  the  output  requisition  (A0*)  transaction.  Before  submitting  the output  requisition  (A0*) transaction  to the  supply  source,  AFMC must  blank  position 71. Note:  This  does not apply  to local  purchase  requisition  transactions  printed  on DD 1348-1A. 5.2.47.4.  Requisition  Override  Records.   Requisition  exception  (REX)  codes may  also  be used  to force  the  ILS-S to override normal  requisition  data as specified  by  the  exception phrase  record.  Requisition  exception  phrase  records loaded  for this  purpose are identified as  requisition  override  records.   Any  alpha  requisition  exception  code  may  be  used  as a requisition  override  record.  Properly  established  requisition  override  records will  improve local  requisitioning  and  reduce  the  need  for  manual  (offline)  requisitions.    Conversely, improper  requisition  override  records  will  generate  invalid  requisitions  and  interna l records.  Use exception  notice  code (ENC) P (process) when  you create requisition  override records.   Note:   Do not  use  ENC R (reject)  because  the  ILS-S will  reject  the  requisit io n transaction.   For each  requisition  override  record,  create  an  ECC image  that  supports  the assigned  requisition  override.    See  Ch  2  for  more  information  concerning  creating  and maintaining  ECC images. 5.2.47.4.1.  Exception  Phrase  Record (EPR).  The  Exception  Phrase  Record (EPR) is  used  to explain  the  reason  for  requisition  overrides  or  modifiers.  When  normal requisitioning  procedures  do not  satisfy  local  requirements,  AFMC may  also  use exception  phrase  records  and requisition  override/modifier  records  to override  the system  designator,  project  code,  routing  identifier  code,  supplementary  address, priority  designator,  and  advice  code on  requisitions.  For example,  you  may  use  a requisition  modifier  on  requisitions  when  a  specific  supplementary  address  is required.  To  establish  exception  phrase  records  and  requisition  override  and modifier  records, follow  the  instructions  in  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 8. 5.2.47.4.2.  Exception  Notice  Code  (ENC).  The  exception  notice  code  (ENC)  is contained  on  each  exception  phrase  record  in  the  ILS-S.    The  ENC  is  used  to augment  REX  codes  and  to  either  stop  (ENC  R)  or  allow  (ENC  P)  requisit io n processing.  Exception  notice  code  R  will  “reject”  any  attempt  to  automatica l ly requisition  the  item.  Exception  notice  code P will  “process”  and  produce  either  a requisition  (A0*)  transaction  or Fund  Requirement  (FRC)  image.  The  ILS-S  will place  the  assigned  REX  code in  position  71 of  the  requisition  (A0*)  transaction. AFMC  must  blank transaction  before the  REX  code  from the  requisition AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 437 submission to  the  source  of  supply.  Note:  If  the  exception  phrase  contains requisition  override  information,  the REX code will  not be placed on the requisit io n transaction. 5.2.47.5.  REX  Code  1  (Temporary  Requisition  Suppression).  When  the  source  of supply  cancels  a  ILS-S  requisition,  REX  code  “1”  (Do  Not  Requisition)  may  be assigned.  Assignment  of  REX  1 prevents  the creation  of any  new  requisitions  until  the reason  for  the cancellation  is resolved.  The ILS-S will  automatically  assign  REX  code 1 as a result  of  receiving  cancellation  status  codes CA, CE, CG, CH, CJ, CK, CP, CR, CV, CY, D3, FF, FG, FL, FM, FN, FO, FP, FU, FX, ZG, or ZH. See Para  5.2.87.7. for more  information  concerning  cancellation  status  codes. REX  code 1 assignment,  if  not resolved,  can negatively  affect  mission  support  by suppressing  automated  requisitio ns. For customer  due-out  requirements,  assignment  REX  code  1 will  cause  the  ILS-S  to produce  a 350 MGT  notice  to notify  personnel  that  management  attention  is  required. See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for  more  information  and corrective  actions  for  the 350 MGT notice.  If  REX  code 1 is  assigned  to the item  record, the  ILS-S will  print  the previous  REX  (if  any)  on  the  350  MGT  notice.  The  previous  REX  code  is  used  to indicate  which  requisition  controls  must  be  reassigned  to  the  item  record  when  the current  cancellation  condition  (REX  1) is cleared  and REX  code 1 is removed  from  the item  record.  If  a  customer  due-out  exists  and  manual  re-requisitioning  action  is required,  the ILS-S will  automatically  remove  the REX code from  the item  record upon successful  processing  of  a  Special  Requisition  (SPR)  transaction  or  FRC  image. Otherwise,  AFMC personnel  must  process a manual  Stock Control  Data Change  (FCD) transaction  to remove  the REX  code before  re-requisitioning. 5.2.47.6.  REX  Codes  4  and  5  (Permanent  Requisition  Suppression).  If  a  source  of supply  cancels  a requisition  and  indicates  permanent  requisition  suppression  applies, AFMC  will  assign  REX  code  4  or  5  to  suppress  all  requisitioning  action.  Once assigned,  REX  4  or  5 will  prevent  the  ILS-S  from  producing  new  requisition  (A0*) transactions.  Note:  Assigning  Exception  Notice  Code P to REX  code 5 will  allow  an A0* to be created. These  requisitions  will  require  external  review.  See Para 5.2.47.4.2 for  guidance  in  processing  the  A0* that  have  ENC P assigned  to the  item  record. REX codes  4  or  5 may  create  additional  manual  workloads  for  Stock  Control.  Therefore, only  assign  REX  codes  4  or  5  to  stock  numbers  when  absolutely  necessary  to permanently  suppress  output  requisition  (A0*)  transactions.  Additionally,  prior  to assigning  REX  code  4  or  5  to  permanently  restrict  requisitioning  action,  AFMC personnel  must  conduct  an external  review  of the stock numbers  and ensure  requisit io n suppression  is appropriate. 5.2.47.7.  Effect  of Requisition  Override  Records on Requisitions.   If a requisition  override record  exists  for  a  stock  number  being  requisitioned,  the  ILS-S  uses  the  data  from  the requisition  override  and  exception  phrase  records  to modify  the  output  requisition  (A0*) transaction.   The ILS-S does not perform  edits to check the accuracy  of requisition  override record data.  Note:   If a stock replenishment  flag  (*) appears in the ILS-S Exception  Phrase Record  (003)  STOCK-REPLENISHMENT-FLG  field, the  system  will  modify  stock replenishment  requisitions.    If  a  customer  due-out  flag  (*)  appears  in  the  003  DUO-REPLENISHMENT-FLG  field,  the  ILS-S  will  modify  requisitions  established  for  all 438 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 customer  due-out  requirements.    If  the  available  override  fields  on  the  exception  phrase record are not  blank,  the  ILS-S will  perform  the following  actions: 5.2.47.7.1.  Project  Code.  A project  code (if  designated)  is  assigned  to the  requisit io n (A0*) transaction  and  corresponding  due-in  detail. 5.2.47.7.2.  System  Designator.   A  system  designator  is  assigned  to  each  requisit io n (A0*)  transaction.    For  stock  replenishment  requisitions,  the  ILS-S  applies  the  item record system  designator  to the  requisition. 5.2.47.7.3.  Routing  Identifier  Code (RIC).  A routing  identifier  code (RIC) is assigned or modified  to the  requisition  (A0*)  transaction  and corresponding  due-in  detail.   The ILS-S applies  the RIC specified  on the exception  phrase  record to determine  where and how  to submit  the  requisition.   Note:   If  UND  A requisition  override  records  specify different than  normal  sources  of  supply,  (override  record  equals  Y),  the  routing identifier  information  from  the  REX  override  record will  be applied.   If the  requisit io n override  record does not contain  RIC information,  the RIC from  the ILS-S Item  Record (101) will  be used. 5.2.47.7.4.  Requisition  Priority  Designator. is assigned  to the requisition  and due-in  details  if  the requisition  priority  designator  is not blank  in  the exception  phrase record.  If the  requisition  priority  designator  is blank,  the ILS-S  will  determine  and  apply  the  correct  requisition  priority  designator  using  a combination  of the  FAD and UND.   A  requisition  priority  designator 5.2.47.7.5.  Requisition  Advice  Code.  When  applied  to requisition  override  records, a requisition  advice  code  is  assigned to  the  requisition  (A0*)  transaction  and  the corresponding  due-in  detail.   See Para 5.2.45 for a list  of requisition  advice  codes used on ILS-S requisitions. Table 5.55.  Requisition  Exception  Code (REX).

Individual  exception  control  (ECC) images  are not  required  when  the ILS-S assigns  REX code ‘1’ as a result  of processing  MILSTRIP  status.  REX  code 1 must  be monitored.  If  a requisition  must  be permanently  suppressed,  process a Stock Control  Data  Change  (FCD) transaction  to change  the  REX  code to 4 or 5. 2. Individual  ECC images  are not required  when  the  ILS-S assigns  REX  3 as a result  of processing  stock list  changes  received  through  the  stock number  user directory  (SN UD). Retain  a  copy of the  036 (End  of Job), 037 (Reserved),  045 (Reserved)  REJ  notice,  or F470 MGT  notice  (BVD03)  in  stock number  sequence  until  action  is  taken  to delete  the  stock number  from  the  ILS-S.  If the  stock number  is not  deleted,  change  to REX  code 4. 3. Individual  ECC images  are not required  for stock numbers  under  the following  conditions: a. REX  code 4 is  assigned  to suppress  requisitions  for  the  following  items: 1) Items  assigned  budget  code V (vehicles) (2) Mechanized  Material  Handling  Systems  (MMHS) (3) Bench  mock-ups/sets (4) Gas Cylinders (5) Constant  Shelter  Material (6) Calendars b. When  complete  processing  instructions  are loaded in  the nomenclature  field;  e.g., requisition  repair  kit. 4. When  alpha  REX  codes are used for  purposes  other  than  requisition  override,  local management  (AFMC, LRS/Material  Management  Activity  of MAJCOM) will  decide how  to manage  and use the  exception  phrase  record, ENC, and ECC image. 440 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5. Satellite  Procurement  Flag.  The  satellite  procurement  flag  is  contained  on the  satellite OCCR (000-099).  REX  code 0 indicates  that  the stock number  contains  an exception (opposite)  to the  flag.  See Table  5.56. Satellite  Procurement  below. 6. ECC images  are not required  to be maintained  for each individual  item  assigned  REX  code 5. Users will  refer  to the  source of  supply  information  system  (e.g.,  email  of  LIMS-EV  SCM View-IPID  Sheets)  for  processing  instructions.   The  ES-S Query  Item  Data screen,  Item Comments  field  will  be used to provide  additional/clarifying  comments  of processing instructions  for those  sources  of  supply  without  information  systems  or where  the website information  is not  current. 7.

Requisitioning  Shelf Life Coded Items. 5.2.48.1.  Purpose.   To  explain  how  shelf  life  coded items  are requisitioned  in  the  ILS-S.  Shelf  life  codes may  be systematically  or manually  assigned.   Manual  assignment  of shelf life  codes is  accomplished  using  a File  Maintenance  Miscellaneous  Data  Change  (FNL) transaction.   See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2 Ch 8 for  format  and processing  instructions  for FNL transactions. 5.2.48.2.  Shelf  Life  Code for Stock Replenishment  Requisitions.   The ILS-S uses shelf  life codes  (when  applicable) for  stock replenishment.   The  stock replenishment  quantity  for items  assigned  a shelf  life  of less  than 30 months  will  not  exceed  one-half  of  the  item’s  shelf  life  days  times  the  Daily  Demand Rate  (DDR).   One-half  the  shelf  life  days  times  the  DDR  functions  as the  Requisitio ning Objective  (RO) when  determining  stock replenishment  quantities. to  determine  how  many items to  requisition 5.2.48.2.1.  Quantity  Less  than  Requisitioning  Objective  (RO).    When  one-half  the shelf  life  days  times  the  DDR  is  less  than  the  computed  RO, the  stock  replenishme nt quantity  will  be  the  difference  between  one-half  the  shelf  life  days  times  the  DDR minus  the computed  Reorder  Level  (ROL).   See Ch 2 for  more information  concerning the  ROL. 5.2.48.2.2.  Quantity  Greater  than  Requisitioning  Objective  (RO).   When  one-half  the shelf  life  days times  the  DDR is  greater  than  the  RO, the  stock replenishment  quantity is  the  difference  between  the  computed  RO minus  the  computed  ROL.   Requisit io ns for  items  containing  short  (one  to six  months)  shelf  life  codes A through  F and  1 or 2 will  be  assigned  priority  06  when  the  normal  requisition  priority  is  07  through  15.   Note:   Shelf  life  logic  is  not  applied  to items  in  federal  supply  group  (FSG)  75, 79, and 85 containing  issue  exception  code (IEX)  E. 5.2.49.  Fund/Signal  Code Assignment  and  MACR Adjustment  For  ILS-S Requisitions. 5.2.49.1.  Purpose.    To  explain  how  the  ILS-S:  1)  assigns  fund,  signal,  and  routing identifier  codes  to  ILS-S  requisitions;  2)  adjusts  the  materiel  acquisition  control  record (MACR)  as  required;  and  3)  creates  received-not-billed  (RNB)  details  as required.   Use Table  5.57  to  determine  correct  budget,  routing identifier,  fund,  and  signal  code assignment  on ILS-S requisitions. 442 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 Table 5.57.

Materiel Acquisition  Control  Record (MACR) Effects On ILS-S Requisitions. 5.2.50.1.  Purpose.  To explain  Materiel  Acquisition  Control  Record (MACR)  edits and the effects  of MACR restrictions  on ILS-S requisitions. 5.2.50.2.  Materiel  Acquisition  Control  Record (MACR) Restrictions.   The Funds Manager establishes  a MACR for all  budget  code 9 and Z items  within  each system  designator.   The MACR allows  the LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  management  to monitor  inventor ies within  the GSD stock fund  by controlling  spending. 5.2.50.2.1.  MACR  Factors.    The  MACR  factor  provides  a  means  for  automatic adjustment  of  the  economic  order quantity  (EOQ) by allowing  a separate  factor  to be loaded for  each subgroup  or stockage  priority  code (SPC).  The  MACR factor  does not have  any  effect  on  requisitioning  objectives.    In  fact,  the  MACR  factor  serves  as  a means  to smooth  the requisitioning  process by extending  the requirement  over a longer period  of  time.   This  results  in  the  generation  of  requisitions  for  smaller  quantities  at increased  frequencies.   The  MACR  factors  allow  the  LRS/Materiel  Management the  health  of  the  GSD  operating  program.   Activity  management to  determine Additionally,  MACR  factors  provide  a  short-term  means to  stabilize  spending programs.   See Ch 2 for  more  information  concerning  the  use of  MACR factors. 5.2.50.2.2.  Urgency  of Need Funding  Flag  (UNFF).  The  urgency  of need funding  flag (UNFF) selectively  restricts  requisition  processing  by using  UND.  The ILS-S produces requisitions  when  customer  issue  requests  contain  a UND (position  1 of the UJC) equal to or  smaller  than  the  UNFF reflected  in  the  MACR.   For  example,  assigning  UNFF “A”  restricts  requisitioning  for all  customer  requests  (except  MICAP) containing  UND A,  B,  or  C.   Note:   UNFFs  are  assigned  to  the  MACR  by  processing  1LM  MACR adjustment  transactions.  See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M and Ch 2 for more information  and format  concerning  MACR adjustment  (1LM)  transactions. Table 5.58.  Urgency  of Need Funding  Flag (UNFF).

Produce Fund  Requirement  Card (FRC) for All  Requirements 5.2.50.2.3.  Maximum  Automatic  Obligation  (MAO).  The  MAO limits  the maximum dollar  amount  of  individual  requisitions.   Two  MAO  monetary  fields  are  locally established  by the Funds Manager  to control  requisitioning  for stock replenishment  and customer  due-out  requirements.    The  MAO  values  are  always  expressed  in  whole dollars  and  are  adjusted  by  loading  new  dollar  figures  with  a  financial  adjustment (MAC)  transaction  input.   See Ch  2 for  loading  MAO  values  on  the  MACR.    Note:   The  minimum  value  that  may  be loaded  is  $50. 5.2.50.2.4.  Total  Obligations  Authorized  (TOA).    The  Total  Obligations  Authorized (TOA) on the MACR represents  the total  dollar  value  of requirements  authorized  to be requisitioned.   The TOA value  applies  to due-out and stock replenishment  requisitio ns.  5.2.50.3.  Effects  of MACR Restrictions.   If customer  or stock replenishment  requireme nts pass  established  MACR  edits,  the  ILS-S  automatically  produces  requisition (A0*) transactions.    For  requirements  that  do  not  pass  MACR  edits,  or  when  the  requisit io n suppression  flag  is  activated,  a Fund  Requirement  (FRC)  image  is  produced.    See Para 5.2.51 for  more  information  concerning  the  requisition  suppression  flag.   See Para  5.2.53 for  more  information  and processing  instructions  for  FRC output  images. 5.2.51.  Requisition  Suppression  Flag. 5.2.51.1.  Purpose.  To explain  the effects  on retail  materiel  management  requisitions  when the  Requisition  Suppression  Flag  is  activated. 5.2.51.2.  Requisition  Suppression  Flag  Processing.   The  ILS-S will  only  produce  a single A977  MGT  notice  for  each  processing  day  after  the  requisition  suppression  flag  is activated.   The A977 MGT  notice  will  be produced for  the first  requisition  that  exceeds the Total  Obligations  Authorized  (TOA)  field  on  the  MACR.    Note:   MICAP  requireme nts and  manual  (offline)  requisitions  are  the  only  exceptions.   However,  under  the  following conditions,  requisitions  will  not  be  created,  and  additional  management  notices  will  be produced  when  the  requisition  suppression  flag  is activated. 5.2.51.2.1.  Actual  Obligations  Plus Actual  Commitments.   The requisition  suppression flag  is  activated  when  actual  obligations  plus  actual  commitments  for  all  categories (WRM/Initial  Spares/etc.)  reach  a specified  or  default  percent  of  the  Total  Financia l Authority  (TFA).    The  requisition  suppression  flag  is  also  activated  when  actual obligations  for  individual  categories  reach  a  specified  or  default  percent  of  their individual  planned  obligations. 5.2.51.2.2.  Total  Operating  Obligations  Plus  Actual  Commitments.   The  requisit io n suppression  flag  is activated  when  total  operating  obligations  plus  actual  commitme nts reach  a specified  or default  percent  of  planned  operating  obligations. 5.2.51.2.3.  Fund  Requirement  (FRC) Output  Image.   Once the requisition  suppression flag  is  activated,  the  ILS-S will  produce  Fund  Requirement  (FRC) output  images  until additional  funds  are  loaded.    During  End-of-Day  (EOD)  processing,  the  requisit io n 446 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 suppression  flag  and  management  notice  indicators  are cleared  each  day.  If additiona l funds  have  not  been loaded  to the  MACR, the  first  requisition  produced  the  following day(s)  the  requisition  suppression  and management  notice  indicator  is  activated.   This sequence  continues  until  funds  are loaded  to the  MACR.   See AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt 3, Ch 2 for  more  information  concerning  the  requisition  suppression  flag  during  EOD processing. 5.2.52.  Other  Funds-Specific  Requisition  Restrictions. 5.2.52.1.  Purpose.  To explain  other  funds-specific  requisition  restrictions  used in  the ILS-S for  DLA and  AFMC items. 5.2.52.2.  AFMC Funding  Limitation.   Requisitions  may  be restricted  in  the  ILS-S based upon  a  combination  of  the  source  of  supply,  item  cost,  and  base  location.    Bases  may provide  a  statement  to  the  item  manager  indicating  limited  base  funds  for  requisitio ns.   When  a funds  limitation  statement  is  received  from  a base, the  item  manager  should  take this  into  consideration  when  procuring  new items  to satisfy  requisitions.   However,   AFMC item  managers  are authorized  to exceed $2500 per line  item,  plus  10 percent,  without  first getting  the  approval  of the  requisitioning  activity. 5.2.52.3.  DLA  Funding  Limitation.  DLA  customer  service  centers  accept and process Air  Force  retail  Materiel  Management  Activity  overseas  requisitions  with  funding limitation  statements  for budget code 9 or Z, non-NSN items  and those items  containing acquisition  advice  code  (AAC)  F (fabricate  or assemble)  or  L (local  purchase).  If  an overseas  (OCONUS) retail  Materiel  Management  Activity  sets a funding  limitation  for DLA  item  requisitions  costing  over  $2,500, AFMC  will  manually  prepare  an  output requisition  (A0*)  document  (DD  1348-1A)  with  document  identifier  code  (DIC) A05/A0E.  Enter  the  statement  “MAXIMUM  FUNDS AUTHORIZED  $XXXX.00”  in the  lower  right-hand  corner  of  the  manually  prepared  requisition  output.  However,  if the  maximum  funds  cited  on the  DD  1348-1A are too low  for  the  DLA  item  manager the  requisition  will  be  canceled.  Note:  Before  submitt ing to  procure  the  item, requisitions  with  funding the  retail  Materiel  Management Activity  should  research  historical  demand  records  to find  the  former  cost of  the same or  a  substitute  item.  This  action  may  prevent  the  requisition  from  being  canceled unnecessarily. limitation  statements, 5.2.53.  Fund  Requirement  (FRC)  File and Image Processing. 5.2.53.1.  Purpose.    The  FRC  image  file  consists  of  customer  (due-outs)  and  stock replenishment  requisitions  that  have  been  suppressed.    Customer  due-out  FRC  images consist  of  priority  customer  requirements  containing  an  UND  of  A  or  B,  and  the  most current  customer  routine  requirements  containing  UND  C.    Stock  replenishment  FRC images  are produced for stock replenishment  restricted  requisition  requirements.   Although GSD  stock  funds  are  generally  available,  retail  materiel  management  activities  are responsible  to operate  within  an approved GSD operating  program.   Therefore,  part of  the total  dollar  value  of the FRC image  file  represents  pending  orders, once requisitioned,  may cause a financial  burden  to the  operating  program.   For this  reason,  selective  requisitio ning of items  may  be performed.   The FRC image  file  is maintained  in  stock number  and system designator  sequence  by customer  due-out  and stock replenishment  images. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 447 5.2.53.1.1.  FRC Image  Consolidation.  When  requisitioning  resumes,  AFMC may consolidate  customer  due-out and stock replenishment  FRC requirements  to reduce the  number  of  requisition  (A0*)  transactions.  AFMC  should  also  consolidate customer  due-out  and  stock  replenishment  FRC  requirements  for  local  purchase items  whenever  possible.  Note:  Air  Force  policy retail  materiel management  activities  to consolidate  requisitions  to the  GSA.  This  policy  applies to both  customer  priority  and  routine  due-out  requirements  containing  UND B and C. requires 5.2.53.1.2.  FRC Consolidation  for  GSA.   To  create  the  single  requisition,  establish  a firm  due-out  to set  the  releveling  flag  on  the  item  record.   The  ILS-S  will  produce  a single  requisition  during  requirements  computation  or  when  the  stock  replenishme nt FRC is reinput.   The UMMIPS priority  will  normally  be based upon the  Force Activit y Designator  (FAD) used for stock replenishment  and the highest  UND (B or C) due-out. 5.2.53.1.3.  FRC Image  Reject  Conditions.   The ILS-S rejects any  FRC input  image  for customer  (due-out)  requirements  if  a corresponding  due-out  detail  cannot  be located, the memo/firm  due-out  flag  is  zero (firm),  or the  FRC input  image  quantity  is  less  than the  due-out  quantity.   Note:   To  requisition  less  than  the  due-out  quantity,  process  a special  requisition  (SPR)  transaction  for  the  required  quantity.   See Para  5.2.54.5 for more  information  concerning  SPR transaction  processing. 5.2.53.2.  FRC Image  for Memo  Customer  Due-Out  Requirements.   The ILS-S produces a separate  FRC image  for  each  memo  customer  due-out  containing  UNDs A and  B.   Note:   FRC  images  are  consolidated into  a  single  requisition  for  memo  customer  due-out requirements  that  contain  ERRCD  XB*  and  a  UND  C.    The  ILS-S  File  Status  or  R04 program  will  generate  FRC images  with  a T in  position  51 for UND C requirements  under these  conditions. 5.2.53.3.  FRC Output  for  Stock Replenishment  Requirements.   The  ILS-S File  Status  or R04 program  will  generate  FRC images  for stock replenishment  requirements. 5.2.53.4.  Transaction  Exception  Code (TEX)  Effect  on  FRC Processing.   The  TEX  code assigned  to FRC images  will  affect  ILS-S processing  as follows: 5.2.53.4.1.  TEX  Code  Blank.    Under  normal  conditions, the  ILS-S  produces  a requisition  (A0*)  transaction  for  the  quantity  requested  if  the  FRC  image  does  not contain  a TEX  code, and the routing  identifier  code (RIC) is not GSA.  If the RIC equals GSA, the ILS-S will  produce a requisition  (A0*) transaction  for the  quantity  requested (stock replenishment)  plus  the total  quantity  required  for  customer  due-outs  containing UND B or C. 5.2.53.4.2.  TEX  Code T - Relevel  and Requisition  for  UND B and C Due-Outs   .The ILS-S will  produce a requisition  (A0*)  transaction  for  FRC images  containing  TEX  T for the  quantity  required  to fill  UND B and C customer  due-outs.   However,  the output requisition  quantity  may  exceed  the  FRC image  input  quantity  if  the  RIC is  GSA and there  are  other  memo  (unrequisitioned)  UND  B  and  C due-outs.    Additionally,  if  a Quantity  Unit  Pack (QUP) is  involved,  the  output  requisition  quantity  will  be adjusted to  the  next  unit  pack.    See  Para  5.2.39  for  more  QUP  information  and  processing instructions. 448 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.2.53.4.3.  TEX  Code  S  –  Relevel  and  Requisition  Entire  Stock  Replenishme nt Quantity.    The  ILS-S  will  produce  a  requisition  (A0*)  transaction  for  FRC  images containing  TEX S for the entire  quantity  required  for stock replenishment.   Note:   UND C due-out  requirements  are also included  in  the  requisition  quantity. 5.2.53.4.4.  TEX  Code R  – Do  Not Relevel  and  Requisition  FRC  Quantity  for  Stock Replenishment.    The  ILS-S  will  produce  a  requisition  (A0*)  transaction  for  FRC images  containing  TEX  R  for  the  requisition input  quantity  required  for  stock.  However,  if  a QUP applies,  the input  quantity  is  adjusted  to the  next  unit  pack.  Note:   Processing  FRC  images  with  TEX  R  prevents the  ILS-S  from  recomputing requirements  for these  items.   Therefore,  excess  due-in  details  may  be established. 5.2.53.4.5.  TEX  Code  7  –  Do  Not  Requisition.   The  ILS-S  will  not  produce  a requisition  (A0*)  transaction  for  FRC images  containing  TEX  7.  When  due-out  FRC consolidation  is  desired,  Stock Control  enters  TEX  code 7 in  the  FRC due-out  images.   Subsequently,  the  system  will  change  the  due-out  memo/firm  flag  to zero  (firm),  and not produce  a requisition. 5.2.53.5.  FRC  Input  for  Customer  Due-Outs  (Supplies).   The  ILS-S  will  produce  a requisition  (A0*)  transaction  for  the  due-out  quantity  contained  on  FRC input  images  for due-out  document  numbers  that  do not  contain  a TEX  code. 5.2.53.5.1.  If the  FRC input  image  quantity  is less  than  the due-out  detail  quantity,  the ILS-S creates  a 266 Reject.   See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for  more  information. 5.2.53.5.2.  If  the  FRC input  image  quantity  is  greater  than  the  due-out  detail  quantity and the type  account  code (TAC)  equals  B (supplies),  the ILS-S produces  a requisit io n (A0*) transaction  for the due-out detail  quantity,  adjusted  to the next  quantity  unit  pack, if  applicable. 5.2.53.5.3.  If  the  FRC input  image  quantity  is  greater  than  the  due-out  detail  quantity and  the  TAC equals  E (equipment),  the  ILS-S creates  a 350 management  notice.   See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for  more  information. 5.2.53.5.4.  If  the  FRC input  image  contains  a  blank  advice  code and  a QUP applies, the  ILS-S adjusts  the  requisition  (A0*)  transaction  quantity  to  the  next  quantity  unit pack.  See Para  5.2.39 for  more  information. 5.2.53.5.5.  FRC  Input  for  Customer  Due-Outs  (Equipment).    The  ILS-S  blanks  the TEX  code  from  the  due-out  detail  if  the  FRC  input  image  applies  to  budget  code  9 equipment  due-outs  and the RIC is  not JBR, J**, or D**.  Note:   The ILS-S creates an I028 MGT notice  during  FRC creation  if  a serviceable  balance  is found.   If serviceable on-hand  balances  are to be bypassed,  use the procedures  for  Special  Requisition  (SPR) transaction  processing.    Conversely, the  ILS-S  will  perform  releveling  on  items containing  FRC input  images  for equipment  due-outs  containing  a TEX code other than blank.   If  the  output  requisitioned  quantity  will  create  an  excess  condition,  the  ILS-S rejects  the FRC input  image. 5.2.53.6.  FRC  Input  for  Stock  Replenishment.    Input  of  FRC  input  images  for  stock replenishment  that  do  not  contain  a  TEX  code  will  cause  the  ILS-S  to  automatica l ly recompute  requirements.   The  ILS-S will  produce  a requisition  (A0*)  transaction  for  the AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 449 input  quantity  or the new quantity  required  for  stock (whichever  is smaller),  plus  all  memo UND B due-outs.   Note:   For FRC requirements  identified  as potential  problem  items,  the ILS-S enters  an asterisk  (*) in  the TEX  Code field  (position  51) of the stock replenishme nt FRC. 5.2.53.7.

Special Requisition  (SPR) Transaction. 452 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.2.54.1.  Purpose.   This  describes  the  application  and  procedures  for  processing  Special Requisition  (SPR)  transactions.   The  SPR  transaction  is  used  to create  due-in  details  for requisitions  when  the  ILS-S  is  inoperative,  and/or  requisition  items  the  ILS-S  does  not automatically  requisition,  and/or  requisition  items  requiring  special  processing  procedures.  5.2.54.2.  Assignment  of  Automated  Requisition  Data.    The  ILS-S  will  automatica l ly assign  the document  identifier  code (DIC), routing  identifier  code (RIC),  media  and status (M&S) code, and demand  code (if  not entered), and produce requisition  (A0*) transactions when  SPR  transactions  are  processed.    See  Para  5.2.37  for  output  requisition  (A0*) transaction  format  and  data  elements.   Additionally,  the  ILS-S  will  assign  an  automated (inline)  requisition  number  when  the  document  number  (position  30-43) field  on  the  SPR transaction  is left  blank.   The ILS-S will  process the SPR transaction,  create a due-in  detail, and  produce  an  output  requisition  (A0*)  transaction  with  the  following  automated  data assigned: 5.2.54.2.1.  Document  Identifier  Code (DIC).   The  ILS-S  will  assign  the  appropriate DIC based upon  the  type of stock number  requisitioned  and base location. 5.2.54.2.2.  Routing  Identifier  Code (RIC).   The  ILS-S will  apply  the  SPR transaction input  RIC (if  entered)  on output  requisition  (A0*)  transactions.   However,  if  the  SPR transaction  input  RIC is  left  blank,  and  no requisition  override  data applies,  the  ILS-S will  apply  the  RIC from  the  item  record on  the  output  requisition.   If  the  RIC  field  is left  blank  on  SPR  transactions  for  local  purchase  and  local  manufacture  items  that cannot  be  obtained  locally  (REX  2),  the  ILS-S  will  assign  the  RIC  to  the  output requisition  based upon  the Federal  Supply  Classification  (FSC) of the  item. 5.2.54.2.3.  Media and Status  (M&S) Code.  For SPR input  transactions,  the ILS-S will assign  the  appropriate  M&S  code  to  the  output  requisition  (A0*)  transaction  based upon  the  requisition  priority  designator.   See  Para  5.2.38  for  more  informa t io n concerning  M&S code assignment.   See  Para  5.2.43 for more  information  concerning requisition  priority  designator  assignment.   Note:      Position  7  of  the  SPR  input transaction  may  be  used  to  assign  a  Special  Requirement  Indicator  (SRI)  to  the requisition  as required.   However,  if  the SPR input  transaction  does  not contain  a SRI, and if  the document  number  and mark-for  fields  are both blank  on input,  the  ILS-S will perform  requirements  computation  on  the  SPR transaction  input  stock number.   If  the input  quantity  exceeds  the computed  requirement,  the ILS-S will  produce  a 305 Reject (QTY  REQD  PLUS  O/H AND ON ORDER  EXCEEDS  AUTH).   See Ch 5 for  more information  concerning  special  requirement  indicator  processing. 5.2.54.2.4.  Document  Number.    If  the  SPR  transaction  input  requisition  document number  (position  30-43)  is  left  blank,  the  ILS-S  will  assign  an  automated  (inline) requisition  document  number.    See  Para  5.2.41  for  more  information  concerning assignment  of automated  requisition  document  numbers. 5.2.54.2.5.  Demand  Code.

Otherwise,  data  entered  on  the  SPR  input  transaction  in  these  fields  will be applied. 5.2.54.3.  Degraded  Operations  Requisitioning  Procedures.  If  the  ILS-S is  inoperative (Degraded  Operations),  AFMC  will  submit  requisitions  as  authorized  by  established Degraded  Operations  procedures.  See  Ch  2  for  more  information.  Note:  During Degraded  Operations,  Air  Force  retail  materiel  management  activities  may  request (requisition)  items  from  supply  sources  by telephone  under  certain  situations.  Special requisition  (SPR)  transactions  are  then  used  to  create  associated  due-  in  details  for Degraded  Operations  requisitions  telephoned  into  the  source  of supply. 5.2.54.3.1.  AFMC  Processing  of  Degraded  Operations  Requisitions.  AFMC  will use  the  following for  Degraded Operations  requirements  when  required. to  process  special  requisitions instructions 5.2.54.3.2.

If the  SPR is  for  a lateral  support  requirement  from  a GSD Stock Fund  (ILS-S) activity,  use the appropriate  D(**) routing  identifier  code.  If  item  record contains  REX  code 2 and the source  of supply  is JB*, leave  this  field  blank. 2.  Special  Requirements  Indicator  (SRI).  If  the  SPR is  for a special  requirement  that exceeds  the requisitioning  objective,  enter  Special  Requirements  Indicator  R in position  7.  When  the Special  Requirements  Indicator  is  used, positions  67-80 must  be AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 455 blank.   If the  SPR is  for  upgrading  a memo  due-out  to MICAP, enter  1 in  position  7, the  MICAP UJC in  positions  52-53, and the  due-out  document  number  in  positions  67-80.  If  the SPR is for  a minimum  buy  requirement  previously  canceled,  take the following  actions: a.  Prepare and process a SPR transaction  with  an  offline  document  number  and SRI R in  position  7. b.  Prepare a manual  requisition  (A0*) transaction  with  the same  SPR offline  document number  and send to the source  of supply. c.  Process a due-in/due-out  update  (DIT)  transaction  to link  the  due-in  and  due-out. d.  Capture  and destroy  the requisition  modifier  (AM*)  transaction  created by the  ILS-S. 3.  Stock Number,  Unit  of  Issue,  Quantity,  and System  Designator.   The  Stock Number must  match  the  Stock Number  of the  Due Out when  the  Due Out Document  Number  is entered  on the  SPR input  (pos. 67-80). When  the Input  Stock Number  does not  match the  corresponding  Stock Number  of the  Due  Out, a 354 Reject  is created.   If the document  number  is  blank,  the  ILS-S assigns  the  requisition  number  (inline)  and creates the  requisition  (A0*).   These  are the  only  fields  required  when  the  ILS-S prepares the  requisition  for  stock replenishment. 4.  Document  Number.   If  applicable,  enter  the 14-character  offline  requisition  number assigned  for  the special  requisition.   If  positions  4-6 are left  blank  for SOS JB* and REX  2, the  document  number  must  be blank  or a 352 REJ  notice  (Input  Routing Identifier  or Vendor  Code Blank  or in  Error)  will  occur.  When  an off-line  requisition number  is  entered  for a requisition  processed to any  RID beginning  with  F (i.e., F**) or DLJ,  a CHA/CH1 transaction  will  be automatically  generated  and sent  to DLATS.

Signal  Code/Fiscal  Year  Code/Command  Unique  Cause Code/Fund  Code/Urgency Justification  Code.  For these  multipurpose  fields,  the  following  information  applies: a.  If  the SPR is for  Base Funded  Investment  Equipment  (budget  code Z), enter  the fiscal  year code of  the appropriation  symbol  (third  character  of symbol)  which  is  to finance  the  requisition  in  position  51. b.  If  the SPR is for  Base Funded  Investment  Equipment  (budget  code Z), enter  the fund  code of the funded  appropriation  financing  the purchase  in  positions  52-53.  For example,  use  fund  code 17 for  appropriation  57*3080, fund  code 29 for  57*3600, or fund  code 8C for  97*0300.4802 (NIMA only).   If appropriation  is 57*3080 (budget code Z) and involves  Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  investment  funds,  use  fund  code XP. c.  If  the SPR is for  Base Funded  Investment  Equipment  (budget  code Z) for  Industrial Fund  activities,  enter  the appropriate  fiscal  year code in  position  51, the fund  code in positions  52-53, and requisition  advice  code 2E in  positions  65-66. d.  If  the SPR is for  a MICAP requirement  and the  item  record contains  REX  Z (Command  Repair  Facility),  it  must  contain  command-unique  cause  codes 1-6 in position  51. e.  If  the SPR is for  stock replenishment,  these  fields  will  be blank  unless  Fund  Code 30/58 is  used.  f.  If  the  SPR is  for a WRM  requirement  required  for  a deployed  unit,  enter  UJC 1T (MRSP) or 1Z (HPMSK) in  positions  52-53 and the  due-out  document  number  of the appropriate  MRSP/HPMSK detail  in  position  67-80. g.  If  the SPR is for  all  other  requisitions,  these  fields  may  be left  blank. 8.  Hour  Code.  If the  SPR is  manually  done and contains  a due-out  document  number in  positions  67-80 for a MICAP condition,  enter  the correct  hour  code in  this  field.   See Para.  5.2.26. for  a list  of  MICAP hour  code. 9.  Project Code.  If  the SPR is  for emergency  local  purchase  of  an item  normally managed  by DLA,  enter  the S** routing  identifier  code (RIC)  in  positions  57-59.  If  the SPR is  for  WRM due-out  requirements,  positions  57-59 should  contain  the  appropriate project code.  10.  Priority  Designator.   If  the SPR is  marked  for a due-out  (positions  67-80) and the SPR transaction  contains  a blank  document  number,  positions  60-61 may  be blank.   The  ILS-S will  compute  and assign  the  requisition  priority  based on a combination  of the  customer  FAD and UJC. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 457 a.  If  positions  60-61 contain  01-10, positions  67-80 must  contain  a due-out  document number  or a 292 REJ  notice  (Invalid  Priority)  will  occur.   See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2 Ch 7 for more  information. b.  If  the SPR is manually  done, an offline  document  number  is  assigned  in  positions 30-43, and positions  60-61 contain  01-10, and positions  67-80 do not  contain  a due-out document  number,  enter  a pseudo due-out  document  number  in  positions  67-80 to establish  the  due-in  detail. 11.  Required  Delivery  Date (RDD).   Enter  RDD  as required  in  positions  62-64. 12.  Advice  Code.  If  the SPR is for  AFEMS L and P number  equipment  brochure items  obtained  laterally,  enter  advice  code 2E in  positions  65-66.  If appropriation  is 57*3080 (budget  code Z) and involves  Air  National  Guard  (ANG) investment  funds, enter  advice  code 2E in  positions  65-66. 13.  Due-Out  Document  Number.   When  the  SPR applies  to ISSL/MSSL/NASSL adjusted  stock levels,  positions  67-70 must  contain  ISSL, MSSL, or NSSL, and positions  71-78 must  contain  a corresponding  serial  number.   If the  SPR is  for  a customer  due-out,  enter  the due-out  document  number  in  positions  67-80.  This  action will  assign  the requisition  priority  and link  the  due-in  and  due-out details. 14.  Data from  the  corresponding  fields  on the  requisition  image.  5.2.55.  Special Requirements  Indicator  (SRI) R. 5.2.55.1.  ILS-S SRI R Processing. 5.2.55.2.  Purpose.    The  ILS-S  will  place  SRI  R  on  the  due-in  detail.   Additionally,  the system  will  add the  SRI R requisition  quantity  to the Requisitioning  Objective  (RO) when the requisition  quantity  is computed.   Note:   SRI R requisition  quantities  are not considered by the ILS-S when  excess due-in  quantities  are computed.   See Ch  2 for  more  informa t io n on due-in  excess  computation. 5.2.56.  Lateral  Support  Requisitioning  Procedures. the  procedures  used  by  retail  materiel  manage me nt 5.2.56.1.  Purpose.    To  explain activities  to requisition  items  from  other  Air  Force bases through  lateral  support  to satisfy requirements.   Both  automated  (inline)  and manual  (offline)  procedures  for submitting  and processing lateral  support  requisitions  by  retail  materiel  management  activities  are discussed.   The  Automatic  Lateral  Support  (sourcing)  feature  of ES-S is  also  addressed. 5.2.56.1.1.  Support  of  D-BRITE  Program  Only.  D-BRITE  requisitions  for  CONUS bases will  first  be sourced  from  the  source  of  supply  (FGZ).  Lateral  support  will  only be  used  once  confirmed  delay  status the  Federal  Aviatio n Administration  (G69). The  D035A  system  does not  have  visibility  of available  assets at G69, so do not consider  a zero balance  at FGZ as delayed  status.

To  support  automated  lateral  requisitioning,  AFMC  personnel  assign  a supporting  requisition  override  record  and  requisition  exception  code (REX)  to  each applicable  item  record.  See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2 for more  information  concerning creation  and management  of  requisition  override  records. 5.2.56.2.1.  Requisition  Override  Record.  The requisition  override  record must  contain the  D**  lateral  support  base  routing  identifier  code  (RIC).    If  a  satellite  account  is shipping  the item,  the requisition  override  record must  contain  the RIC of the satellite's host  computer  support  base  (CSB),  and  the  system  designator  of  the  satellite.   Additionally,  to  automate  lateral  support  requisitions,  the  requisition  override  record will  contain  the  following  data: 5.2.56.2.1.1.  Lateral  requisition  flag.   Assign  a lateral  requisition  flag  of one (1). 5.2.56.2.1.2.  Requisition  advice  code.    Assign  the  requisition  advice  code  to identify  one  of  the  following  options  for  the  lateral  support  retail  Materiel Management  Activity: 5.2.56.2.1.2.1.  Fill  or  pass  option.   To  process  the  requisition  as  fill  or  pass, leave  the  advice  code blank.   If  the  requisition  cannot  be filled,  it  is  passed  to the  source  of supply  indicated  by the  routing  identifier  code (RIC)  in  positions 78-80.  No lateral  due-in  detail  is  established  at the lateral  support  base. 5.2.56.2.1.2.2.  Fill  or  kill  option.    To  process  the  requisition  as  fill  or  kill, assign  advice  code 2C.  Advice  code 2C advises  the lateral  support  base to  fill the  requisition  quantity  if  possible  and  cancel  the  portion  of  the  requisit io n quantity  that cannot  be filled.   See Para 5.2.31 for more information  concerning requisition  advice  code 2C. 5.2.56.2.1.2.3.  Fill  or  backorder  option.   To  process  the  requisition  as  fill  or backorder, normally  assign  requisition  advice  code 6X.  If the  requisition  is  for an economic  order quantity  (EOQ) item  and the  cumulative  recurring  demands (CRDs)  at the  lateral  support  base are to be updated,  assign  requisition  advice code 6Y.  Note:   When  the fill  or backorder option  is  used, the  lateral  support ILS-S will  ship  assets  to zero  balance.   See Para  5.2.31  for  more  informa t io n concerning  6X and 6Y requisition  advice  codes. 5.2.56.2.2.  Lateral  Requisition  (A0*) Output  Format.   When the lateral  requisition  flag on the requisition  override  record is  set to one, the lateral  requisition  (A0*) transaction is  produced with  the following  data: 5.2.56.2.2.1.  Routing  Identifier  Code (RIC).  Positions  4-6 equals  the  D(**) lateral support  base  routing  identifier  code  (RIC)  contained  on  the  requisition  override record.  Positions  73-75 will  contain  the RIC of the  requisitioner,  and positions  78-80 will  contain  the  RIC of  the source  of supply. 5.2.56.2.2.2.  Force Activity  Designator  (FAD), Urgency  Justification  Code (UJC).  If  the  lateral  requisition  is for  a customer  due-out,  positions  62-64 will  contain  the requesting  organization's  force activity  designator  (FAD) and issue  request  urgency justification  code  (UJC).    Note:     The  ILS-S  due-in  detail  will  contain  the  RIC assigned  to the item  record. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 459 5.2.56.2.3.  Due-In  Detail  and Funding  Records.   Due-in  details  will  be established  at the  base  that  originates  the  lateral  requisition.    Funding  records  will  be  established based upon  the  item  record routing  identifier  code and  budget  code assigned. 5.2.56.2.4.  Processing  Lateral  Requisitions  at  the  Lateral  Support  Base.    When  the lateral  support  base receives  requisition  (A0*) transactions,  they  are directly  input  into the ILS-S.  Note:   The system  will  accept and process lateral  support requisition  (A0*) transactions  against  the input  system  designator  only.   The  ILS-S at the lateral  support base  releases  and  ships  available  assets  to  fill  lateral  requisition  requirements  based upon  the  priority  designator. 5.2.56.2.5.  Lateral  Support Requisition  Supply  Status.   The ILS-S at the lateral  support base  provides  supply  status  (AE*)  transactions  for  the  requisition  (A0*).    Shipment status  (AS*)  is  provided  for  each  item  physically  shipped.    Note:   If  the  fill  or  pass option  is  used  and  the  lateral  requisition  is  passed  to the  source  of  supply,  the  lateral support  base will  not  provide  supply  status.   Normal  MILSTRIP  supply  and  shipment status  transactions  apply.   See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5B, Order and Requisitioning  for more  information  on  supply  status  (AE*)  processing,  and  Para  5.2.88 for  a list  of  the different  MILSTRIP  supply  status  codes.    The  following  paragraphs  describe  the different  types  of  status  that  may  be received  from  the  lateral  support  base.  The  type of status  received  is  based upon  the  requisition  signal  and  advice  codes. 5.2.56.2.5.1.  Signal  Code D or M. 5.2.56.2.5.1.1.  Fill  or pass (requisition  advice  code equals  blank).   The  ILS-S assigns  supply  status  code BA (release  for  shipment)  for  the quantity  availab le.   For  the  unfilled  quantity,  the  ILS-S  will  pass  the  requisition  to  the  routing identifier  code (RIC)  in  positions  78-80 of the  input.   BM  (passing)  status  will be provided  to the  requisitioner. 5.2.56.2.5.1.2.  Fill  or  kill  (requisition  advice  code  equals  2C).    The  system provides  BA status  for  the  quantity  available  and  CB (not  filled)  status  for  the quantity  killed. 5.2.56.2.5.1.3.  Fill  or  backorder  (requisition  advice  code  equals  6X  or  6Y).  The  system  provides  BA  status  for  the  quantity  available,  and  BD  (delayed) status  for  the  quantity  not  available. 5.2.56.2.5.2.  AMC  Forward  Supply  System  (FSS)  WRM  Lateral  Requisitio ns.   When  an AMC FSS lateral  requisition  quantity  cannot  be totally  filled  because  of a  shipment  (SHP)  transaction  constraint, the  ILS-S  produces  a  supply  status (AE(x))  transaction  containing  status  code  “BQ.”    The  ILS-S  will  not  allow multiple  shipments  for  the same  requisition  document  number.   When  BQ status  is received,  the  requisitioner  must  submit  a  new  lateral  requisition  with  a  new document  number  for  the cancelled  quantity. 5.2.56.2.6.  I023  MGT  notice.    Under  certain  conditions,  the  ILS-S  will  produce  an I023 MGT  notice  upon  input  of  a lateral  support  requisition  (A0*)  transaction  at  the lateral  support  base.  See AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2 Ch 7 for  more  information  and  the output  format  of  the  I023  MGT  notice. the circumstances  when  the  I023 will  be produced.   The  following  paragraphs  detail 460 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.2.56.2.6.1.  Firm  DIFM/Supply  Point  Balances  Exist  (requisition  advice  code equals  blank).   If  the  lateral  support  requisition  (A0*) transaction  input  requisit io n advice  code is  blank  (fill  or pass) and  a firm  due-in-from- maintenance  (DIFM)  or Supply  Point  balance  exists,  the  ILS-S  will  generate  an  I023  MGT  notice  when there  are  not  enough  items  to  completely  satisfy  the  lateral  support  requisit io n quantity.    The  lateral  support  base  must  determine,  based  upon  the  requisit io n priority,  if  the  remaining  quantity  on  the  lateral  support  requisition  should  be satisfied  from  DIFM  or Supply  Point  assets,  or passed to  the  source  of  supply  for action. 5.2.56.2.6.2.  War  Reserve  Materiel  (WRM)  Balances  Exits  (requisitio n  advice code  equals  6X,  6Y,  or  2C).   If  the  lateral  support  requisition  (A0*)  transaction input  advice  code  is  6X/6Y  (fill  or  backorder)  or  2C  (fill  or  kill),  and  WRM balances  exist  at  the  lateral  support  base,  the  ILS-S  will  generate  an  I023 management  notice.    Note:    The  I023  MGT  notice  is  generated  because  WRM assets may  only  be released  by management. 5.2.56.2.6.3.  Processing  I023 management  notices.   Use the following  instruct io ns to process the  I023 MGT  notice. 5.2.56.2.6.3.1.  Fill  requisition  from  DIFM  and/or  supply  point  balances.  If AFMC at the lateral  support base chooses to fill  the request with  the availab le items  from  either  DIFM  and/or  Supply  Point  balances,  reinput  the  lateral support  requisition  (A0*)  transaction  using  requisition  advice  code 6X or 6Y as appropriate. 5.2.56.2.6.3.2.  Pass requisition.   The  lateral  support  base uses this  option  only after  deciding  not  to  use  available  items  to  fill  the  request.    To  use  the  pass requisition  option,  the  lateral  support  base reinputs  the  original  lateral  support requisition  (A0*) transaction  with  an “X”  in  position  54.   Note:   The  first  line of print  from  the  I023 MGT  notice  is used for  the A0* transaction  format.   The X in  position  54 prevents  the ILS-S from  generating  another  I023 MGT  notice and provides  appropriate  supply  status  (BN) to the requisitioner. 5.2.56.2.6.3.3.  Kill  requisition.   If  the  lateral  support  base  decides  to kill  (do not  fill)  the  lateral  support  requisition,  the  lateral  support  requisition  (A0*) transaction is  reinput  with  requisition  advice  code  2C.    Advice  code  2C generates  CB  status  for  the  requisitioning  base.    See  Para  5.2.87  for  more information  concerning  CB status. items  are  available  for  shipment,  additional 5.2.56.2.7.  Lateral  Requisition  Shipment  Edits.   After  the  lateral  support  base ILS-S has  determined internal  checks  are performed  to determine  if  the  items  may  be shipped.   If  these  checks  are  passed,  the requested  items  are  released  for  shipment  by  changing  the  input  lateral  requisit io n (A0*) transaction  to an input  lateral  redistribution  order (A2*). 5.2.56.2.7.1.  Shipment  Exception  Code (SEX).   If  the requested  item  at the lateral support  base  is  available,  and  does  not  have  a  SEX  assigned,  the  item  will  be shipped.   If position  76 of the lateral  requisition  (A0*) transaction  contains  the item SEX code, this  indicates  that  lateral  support requisition  has previously  rejected and AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 461 an I023 MGT  notice  was produced.  Therefore,  the  lateral  support  ILS-S considers this  condition  as  management  approval  for  the  lateral  shipment  and  will  continue processing  the  shipment. 5.2.56.2.7.2.  Exception  Notice  Code (ENC).   If  the  exception  notice  code on  the shipment  exception  phrase  record located  at the  lateral  support  ILS-S is R (Reject), the  system  will  generate  a  289  Reject.    If  the  ENC  at  the  lateral  support  retail Materiel  Management  Activity  is  P (process),  the items  will  be shipped  as directed in  the  shipment  override  record.    See  AFH  23-123, Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  7  for  more information  and corrective  actions  concerning  289 REJ  notices. 5.2.56.3.  High  Priority  Lateral  Support  Definition.    Lateral  support  is  authorized  for Mission  Capable  (MICAP)  requirements,  Awaiting  Parts  (AWP),  and  JCS project-coded needs.  Authorized  lateral  support  requests  shall  be filled  from  Peacetime  Operating  Stock (POS),  Readiness  Spares  Package  (RSP),  or  Forward  Supply  Location  (FSL)  assets  as detailed  in  Table 5.64. 5.2.56.3.1.  High  priority  lateral  support  policy.    In  general,  lateral  support  (donor) bases  shall  honor  high  priority lateral  support  requests  when  the  priority  of  the requisition  need  (requestor)  is  greater  than  the  priority  of  the  resulting  replenishme nt requisition  based  on  the  Spares  Priority  Release  Sequence  (SPRS).

ES-S  includes  an  Automatic  Lateral Support  features  designed  to  support  MICAP,  AWP,  JCS  project  coded,  and  Forward Supply  Location  (FSL)  project  coded  requirements.    ES-S’s Automatic  Sourcing  feature uses  complex  sourcing  rules  (based  on  the  rules  above)  and  near-real  time  asset  and requirements  data from  source systems  (ILS-S, SCS, and EBS) to automatically  determine the best enterprise  source for fulfillment  of requisitions.   Once the best source is determined the  system  will  create  the  appropriate  legacy  system  transactions  to initiate  the  movement of  the  asset(s)  from  the  selected  source.    The  automatic  sourcing  capability  is  flexib le enough  to  suspend/start  automatic  sourcing  as  needed  (e.g.,  for  a  specific  stock  number, base, etc.).  A detailed  description  of  this  feature  is  available  in  Ch 12 of the  ES-S User’s Manual. 5.2.57.  Part  Number  Requisitioning  Procedures. 5.2.57.1.  Purpose.  This  paragraph  explains  requisitioning  procedures  for  part-numbered item  requisitions  generated  by  the  ILS-S.  Document  identification  codes,  item  record coding,  and  supporting  documentation  requirements  are  described  for  each  source  of supply  when  applicable.  See AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt 4 Ch  6 for  Part  Number  (Exception) Requisitions. 5.2.57.2.  Commercial  and  Government  Entity  (CAGE)  Code.  The  Commercial  and Government  Entity  (CAGE)  code  identifies  individual  manufacturing  activities  for  part numbered  items.  Specific  CAGE  codes are defined  in  Federal  Cataloging  Handbooks  H4-1 and  H4-2. When  a CAGE  code cannot  be determined,  use PSEUDO  CAGE  CODE 6ZE66 5.2.57.3.  User/End  Item  Application.   The  User/End  Item  Application  field  identifies  the Technical  Order  (TO)  number,  drawing  number,  specification  number,  end  item,  or  any other  reference  data to assist  the  source  of supply  to identify,  procure,  and/or  manufac t ure the  correct part-numbered  item. 5.2.57.4.  DLA and GSA Part Number  Requisitions.   The DLA  and GSA will  normally  not accept  part  numbered  or  non-cataloged  item  requisitions  from  CONUS Air  Force  bases.  Special  document item  record  coding,  and  supporting  documentation  are required  to process these  types of  requisitions  as follows: identifier, 5.2.57.4.1.  Document  Identifier  Code  (DIC)  A0E/A05.  Document identifier  A0E (CONUS) and A05 (OCONUS) requisition  transactions  are produced  for  all  GSA and DLA  part number  requisitions.  Additionally,  A0E and A05 transactions  are used  on all other  sources  of  supply  part number  requisitions  if  the  part number  exceeds  ten  digits (P-serialized),  or the  Commercial  and  Government  Entity  (CAGE)  equals  "PSEUD O 464 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 CAGE  CODE  6ZE66"  .  Note:  Either  of  these  circumstances  dictate  additiona l information  must  be  provided  to  the  source  of  supply  to  assist  in  the  identificat io n, procurement,  and/or  manufacturer  for  the requisitioned  item. 5.2.57.4.2.  General  DLA/GSA  Part  Number  Requisition  Processing.  For  both CONUS and OCONUS DLA/GSA  part number  requisitions,  AFMC (for  MICAPs) and LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  (for  non-MICAPs)  will  re-format  the part number  item  requisition  (A0E/A05)  output  by  entering  the  required  data  in  the MILSTRIP  portion  of the DD 1348-6 (non-NSN requisition).  Leave positions  8-22 (NSN)  blank  and  enter  the  entire  CAGE  code  and  part  number  (except  for  the federal  supply  code (FSC)) in Block  One of the identification  data on the DD 1348-6. See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for  more  information  concerning  DD  1348-6. After  you  have  completed  the  DD  1348-6, mail  the  requisition  transaction  and the DD 1348-6 to the source of supply  using  MILSTRIP  part number  requisitio ning procedures.  See AFH 23-123, Vol  1, Ch 2 for  more  information. 5.2.57.4.3.  GSA Part Number  Requisitioning  Policy  for Overseas Bases.  If the source of  supply  is  the  GSA,  overseas  bases should  process the  requisition  using  MILSTRIP part number  requisitioning  procedures,  with  the following  exceptions:   MILSTRIP  part number/non-NSN  message  requisitions  will  be  sent  to  HQ  CASC/CCH,  74  N.  Washington  Ave., Battle  Creek, MI. 49017-3094.  The Cataloging  and Standardizat io n Center  (CASC) will  perform  the  necessary  part  number  research  required  in  order  for GSA  to  process  the  requisition.    CASC will  return  abbreviated  MILSTRIP  message supply  status.   A status  message  containing  delayed  (BD)  status  will  be provided  to the requisitioning  base  with  an  estimated  release  date  (ERD)  30  days  greater  than  the requisition  date.  This  message  should  be used as the source  to update ILS-S status  with an AE* status  input  transactions.   It is  important  these  inputs  are processed in  a timely manner  in  order  to  delay  automated  follow-up  (AF*)  transactions to  GSA.    See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5B,  Order and  Requisitioning  for  more  information  concerning requisition  status  (AE*)  and requisition  follow-up  (AF*) transaction  processing. 5.2.57.4.4.  DLA  Part  Number  Requisitions  Containing  Document  Identifier  Code (DIC) A0B/A02.  Assign  DIC A0B (CONUS) or A02 (OCONUS) to requisition  (A0*) transactions  if  DLA is the source of supply,  the manufacturer’s  part number  is ten digits or less,  and the CAGE  code is  not  "PSEUDO  CAGE  CODE 6ZE66".   LRS/Materie l Management  Activity  (except for MICAPs) will  reformat  the requisition  by placing  the manufacturer’s  CAGE code in  positions  8 through  12 and the part number  in  positions 13 through  23 of the  output  requisition  (A0B/A02)  transaction. 5.2.57.5.  HQ  AFMC  Part  Number  Items.    Process  AFMC  part  number  requisitions  as follows: 5.2.57.5.1.  Document  Identifier  Code (DIC) A0B/A02.  Assign  DIC A0B (CONUS) or A02  (OCONUS)  on  HQ  AFMC  part  number  requisition  (A0*)  transactions  if  the CAGE code is  not ZZZZZ,  the manufacturer's  part number  is ten  digits  or less,  and the technical  order (TO)  identification  number  is  loaded  in  the  nomenclature  field  on  the ILS-S item  record. For example,  TO reference  TO 1C-130E-507 would  be assigned  to the  nomenclature  field.  See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  8  for  more  informa t io n concerning  the  establishment  of ILS-S part number  records. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 465 5.2.57.5.2.

Use CPF transactions  to load, change,  or delete  JCS Project  Flags  and  JCS/Intra-Air  Force project  codes assigned  to item  records.  Note:   You  must  assign  both  a JCS Project  Flag  and  JCS/Intra-Air  Force project  code to the  item  record with  the  CPF transaction  or a reject will  occur.   If  the stock number  is part of an ISG, the  ILS-S will  programmatically  assign  the JCS Project  Flag  and JCS/Intra- Air Force project  code to all  Master  (M) and  Interchangeable  (I)  coded stock numbers  within the  group.   However,  if  the  stock number  is  a bachelor  item  or substitute  (S) coded item, the ILS-S will  assign  the JCS Project Flag  and JCS/Intra-Air  Force project code to the item record of the  input  stock number  only.

To  explain  automatic  and  forced  (manual)  customer  due-out  release processing. 5.2.62.2.  Automatic  Customer  Due-Out  Release  Process.    The  ILS-S  automatica l ly releases  serviceable  assets  to  established  customer  backorders  (due-outs)  when  receipt, 470 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 turn-in,  stock  number  merge/change, ISG  add/change,  condition/identity  change,  or inventory  adjustment  actions  increase  the item  record serviceable  balance.   Automatic  due-out  release  processing  continues  until  all  available  serviceable  assets  are  depleted  or  no other customer  backorders exist.   Available  assets include  all  serviceable  assets on the item record  or compatible  item  records  within  the  interchangeable  and  substitute  group  (ISG).  Note:      Customer  backorders  containing  TEX  1,  8,  H,  U,  X,  or  period  (.)  do  not automatically  release available  assets to customers.   See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for TEX definitions  and  processing  instructions. 5.2.62.3.  Manual  Prevention  of Automatic  Due-Out  Release.   If  management  desires,  the following  transaction  exception  (TEX)  codes  may  be used  to  prevent  automatic  due-out release  of  assets to satisfy  customer  backorders. 5.2.62.3.1.  TEX  Code  by  Transaction  Processing  Effects.    If  the  backorder  release (DOR)  transaction  contains  TEX  3 or 6, or the  receipt  (REC)  transaction  TEX  equals 2, 6, or Y, or the  turn-in  (TIN) transaction  contains  TEX  B, D, 2,  or 4, automatic  due-out  release  is  prevented.   Note:   If  a local  purchase  (routing  identifier  JB(*))  item  is received  and  the  DOR  transaction  contains  TEX  3, the  linked  customer  backorder  is released  first.    Any  additional  assets  will  release  to  any  other  customer  backorder requirements  second. 5.2.62.3.2.  TEX  Code T.   If  the  customer  backorder  contains  TEX  T,  and  the  stock number  backordered  is  different  from  the  received  stock  number,  automatic  due-out release  is  prevented. 5.2.62.4.  Sequence  of Due-Out  Release.   The  sequence  of release  is  based upon  the force activity  designator  (FAD),  urgency justification  code  (UJC),  project  code,  type  of requirement,  (TEX code 0 due-outs),  and document  number  date.  See Para 5.2.65 for ILS-S  asset  sequence  of  release  methodology.   AMC  Offshore  Customer Backorders.   AMC  offshore  customer  backorders  are  released  in  a unique  sequence  after all  other  UND  B  due-outs.    Normal  sequence  of  release  (as  described  above)  does  not apply.   See Para  5.2.15 and Para  5.2.16  for  document  flow  and distribution  instruct io ns for  the DD Form  1348-1A, due-out  release  (DOR)  output  document.   Exception: 5.2.62.5.  Forced (Manual)  Due  Out Release  of Serviceable  Assets.  Serviceable  assets can be manually  (forced)  released  to a specific  customer  backorder by processing  of any  of the following  transactions: 5.2.62.5.1.  Due-out  release  transaction  containing  TEX  3 in  position  51, and the  due-out document  number  in  positions  30-43. 5.2.62.5.2.  Turn-in  transaction  containing  TEX  B, D, 2, 4 in  position  51, and the  due-out  document  number  in  positions  67-80.  See AFMAN  23-122, Sec 6B,  Returns  for more  information  and  transaction  format. 5.2.62.5.3.  Receipt  transaction  containing  TEX  2, 6, or Y in  position  51, and the  due-out document  number  in  positions  60-73. 5.2.62.6.  Optional  Force DOR Method.   Enter  TEX  8 in  position  51 of  the  receipt  (REC) or  turn-in  (TIN)  transaction  and  process  through  the  ILS-S.   Enter  the  terminal  functio n AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 471 number  in  positions  52-53 of  the input  transaction  to direct  the  DD Form 1348-1A, output DOR document,  to a specific  terminal.   Exceptions  are as follows: 5.2.62.6.1.  Automatic  Release.    With  automatic  release,  only  the  specific  due-out being  forced  released  prints  at  the  terminal  indicated  in  positions  52-53.   Any  other release  documents  are printed  at the  appropriate  warehouse  terminal  function. 5.2.62.6.2.  Satellite  Terminals.   Due-out  release  transactions  for  satellite  system designators,  input  at  the  host  base,  may  only  indicate  the  receiving  terminal  of  the satellite  function  in  positions  52-53 of  the  input  transaction.    The  ILS-S  ignores  all other  function  numbers. 5.2.62.6.3.  Output  Document.   Process  the output  DD Form  1348-1A due-out  release (DOR) output  document  as specified  in  Para  5.2.16. 5.2.62.7.  Due-Out Release  of Substitute  Assets.  Upon receipt  of a suitable  item  substitute, the  ILS-S automatically  releases  customer  due-outs  against  the  stock number  received  if possible.   See AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt  2, Ch  8 for  more  information  concerning  suitable item  substitutes. 5.2.62.7.1.  One-Way  Interchangeable  Flag. record  one-way interchangeable  flag  is a Y, the  ILS-S edits  the  ISG source  code.  Assets  will  only  due-out  release  automatically  when  the  101-ISG-SOURCE  code  on  the  received  item  is equal  to or greater  than  the  101-ISG-SOURCE code on the requested  item.   When the item 5.2.62.7.2.  Different  Units  of Issue.   When  the  substitute  item  unit  of issue  is differe nt than  the  unit  of  issue  for  the  requested  item,  the  ILS-S  automatically  converts  (if possible)  the  requested  item  due-out  quantity  and  releases  the  property  issued.    All remaining  customer  due-outs  for  the  stock  number  received, the  stock  number requested,  and master  and interchangeable  items  will  also release.   Note:   This  process does not apply  to due-out activity  code S, W, M, U, or F, and those due-outs  containing TEX  T.  When  a substitute  item  is being  forced  released  for  a due-out  with  a differe nt unit  of  issue  and  the  unit  of  issue  cannot  be  converted,  the  ILS-S  produces  an  I032 MGT  notice  (Due-out  DTL  Unit  of  Issue  Cannot  be Converted  for  Auto  DOR).   The I032 MGT notice  displays  the due-out  document  number  that  could  not  be released  in positions  30-43 of  line  2.  Additionally,  all  due-out  details  for  the  received  item  and ISG  are  printed.    See    AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  7  for  more  information  and processing  instructions  for  the I032 management  notice. 5.2.63.

Repair  Cycle  and Expendable  Item  Due-Out  Release. 5.2.64.4.1.  Repair  Cycle  Items.   When  a repair  cycle  item  (ERRCD  XD/XF)  due-out release  is  processed  in  the  ILS-S,  DIFM  control  remains  under  the  stock  number originally  requested.   If  a repair  cycle  item  is received  for an activity  code D (SPRAM) customer  backorder,  use the  procedures  stated  in  AFMAN  23-122, Sec. 5G, SPRAM.  The ILS-S will  increase  the applicable  SPRAM detail  record on-hand  quantity  field.   If a substitute  item  is  received  for a SPRAM backorder, the  ILS-S will  build  a substitute detail  record.  See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5G, SPRAM  for more  information. 5.2.64.4.2.  Expendable  Items.   EOQ (ERRCD  XB3) items  will  not automatically  due-out  release  for  repair  cycle  item  (ERRCD  XD(*)/XF(*))  backorders.  If  such  a release is  attempted,  a 100 Reject  is  produced.  See  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7  for more information  concerning  100  rejects.    If  an  EOQ  item  is  subsequently  received  for  a 474 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 repair  cycle  item  customer  backorder,  cancel  the  repair  cycle  due-out  and  process  a customer  issue  request  for  the EOQ item  using  the  appropriate  demand  code. 5.2.64.5.  Recapped Tire  Due-Out  Release.   Recapped tires  are not released  automatica l ly by the  ILS-S.  During  turn-in  or receipt  processing  of  a recap tire  an I028 (Select  D/O To Be Force Release)  printed  listing  all  customer  backorder requirements.   If the recap tire  can satisfy  any  of  the  due-outs,  prepare  and process a manual  (forced)  DOR transaction  using TEX  3 in  position  51 (Para  5.2.63).  Note:   A supply  point  detail  record  must  be loaded in  the  ILS-S for  the master  stock number  with  type  authorization  T or a 260 Reject will  be produced.    See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  1,  Ch  2  for  more  information  concerning type authorization  codes.  See  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7  for  more information  concerning 260 rejects. 5.2.64.6.  Stockage  Priority  Code (SPC) E  Item  Due-Out  Release.   Customer  backorders for  equipment  items  that  contain  stockage  priority  code  (SPC)  E  are  not  automatica l ly released.   When  a receipt  or turn-in  transaction  is  processed, the  ILS-S produces  an  I028 MGT  notice  listing  all  associated  backorders.   Any  existing  customer  backorders  may  be force  due-out released  using  TEX  3 as specified  in  Para  5.2.63.  See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 2B, Stockage Procedure  for  more  information  concerning  assignment  of SPC E. 5.2.64.7.  MRSP/IRSP  Item  Due-Out  Release. 5.2.64.7.1.  Supportable  Assets. the MRSP/IRSP  detail  on  hand  or deployed  quantities  as appropriate,  as well  as the  025-SUP-UNITS-ON-HAND.  The  MRSP/IRSP  backorders release  just  ahead  of  urgency of  need  designator  (UND)  C requirements  in  the  ILS-S release  order  and within  025-MRSP-IRSP priority  designator.   Release  of  supportable  assets increases 5.2.64.7.2.  Unsupportable  Assets.  Unsupportable  item  backorders are established  with TEX  U.    When  an  unsupportable  asset  is  received,  a  supportable  due-out  for  the quantity  received  is built  by the ILS-S and inserted  into  the  release  order.  The  TEX  U (unsupportable)  due-out  is  simultaneously  deleted,  or  in  the  case  of  a  partial  receipt, decremented.   The  new  due-out  (supportable)  reflects  an  identical  document  number.   However,  the  ILS-S-assigned  next  available  serial  number  (date  portion)  is  differe nt.   When  the  unsupportable  quantity  on  the  detail  record  equals  zero,  the  supportabilit y code  is  blanked.    See  AFMAN  23-122,  Sec  2I,  Provisioning  for  more  informa t io n concerning  supportable  and unsupportable  WRM items. 5.2.64.7.2.1.  The  force  due-out  release  (DOR)  is  permitted  for  TEX  U  due-out detail  records only. 5.2.64.7.2.2.  A TEX  2 receipt  is  allowed  to provide  the  capability  to release  only the  linked  TEX  U  or  a  non-TEX  U  higher  priority  due-out.    This  can  be accomplished  by  inserting  the  due-out  document  number  in  positions  60-73 of  the TEX  2 receipt. 5.2.64.7.3.  Release  of  Least  Acceptable  Flagged  MRSP/IRSP  Items.    When  an MRSP/IRSP  detail  record  contains  a  least  acceptable  flag  (in  FILLER-1  field)  other than  blank,  a substitute  item  will  not  be released  to satisfy  due-outs  against  that  detail unless  the  101-ISG-SOURCE code on the receipted  item  is equal  to or greater  that  the least  acceptable  flag  on the MRSP/IRSP  detail. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 475 5.2.64.8.  Off-Base  Supply  Point  Item  (TEX  Z)  Due-Out  Release.    When  an  off-base supply  point  customer  issue  request  is  processed, and the  type authorization  on the  supply point  detail  equals  D, the use  of TEX  Z will  result  in  the  following: 5.2.64.8.1.  Establishes  a Linked  Due-In.   The due-out  release  program  interfaces  with the requisitioning  programs  to establish  a linked  due-in.   Because  the supply  point  due-out contains  a linked  due-in  established  with  TEX  Z, the asset will  not be released  until the  asset for the  linked  due-in  is received. 5.2.64.8.2.  Direct  Shipment  to Remote  Supply  Points.   This  procedure  accommodates direct  shipment  to  remote  supply  points  by  providing  the  218-DIRECT-SHIP-SRAN to the  requisitioning  process  for  automatic  insertion  in  the  due-in  at the  time  the  due-out is  established. 5.2.64.9.  Local  Purchase  (Budget  Code 9) Item  Due-Out  Release. 5.2.64.9.1.  Budget  code 9 local  purchase  customer  backorders will  be released  and the  customer  charged,  according  to the following  criteria: 5.2.64.9.1.1.  Linked  Local  Purchase  Due-Outs.   The  receipted  item  due-in  detail record will  release  to its  linked  due-out  detail  record before  releasing  to any  other requirements. 5.2.64.9.1.2.  Customer  Charges.   When  the  due-in  received  is  linked  to a specific due-out detail  record, the customer  will  be charged  the unit  price from  the 205 detail record (due-out).   When  the due-in  received  is not linked  to a specific  due-out detail record, the customer  will  be charged  the unit  price from  the  202 detail  record (due-in).   Note:   When  a due-out  release  is  caused  by  other  than  the  normal  receipt  of an  item  due-in,  the  customer  will  be  charged  the  unit  price  from  the  101 record (item  record). 5.2.64.10.  Unserviceable  Materiel  from  DLADS  Due-Out  Release.    Due-out  release should  occur automatically  from  receipt  processing,  unless  a reject condition  exists.   After correcting  any  reject  condition,  process  a  manual  DOR  transaction  with  the  due-out document  number  in  positions  30-43,  TEX  3  in  position  51,  and  the  unserviceab le document  number  in  positions  60-73.    See  Para  5.2.63  for  the  manual  (forced)  DOR transaction  format  and processing  instructions. 5.2.65.  ILS-S Order  Of Release Sequence Table. 5.2.65.1.  Purpose.    To  describe  the  sequence  of  release  for  due-out  release  (DOR) transaction  processing.

Requisition  Modifications. 5.2.70.1.  Requisition  Modifier  Input  (DIT)  Transaction.   The due-in/due-out  update (DIT) transaction  is  used  to  change  various  data  elements  on  ILS-S  due-in  details.    See Para 5.2.71  for  information  concerning  eligible  data  elements,  and  the  format  for  requisit io n modifier  input  (DIT)  transaction. to  modify  requisition  data  and  produce  requisition  modifier 5.2.70.2.  Requisition  Modifier  Output  (AM*)  Transaction.  AFMC  uses  the  DIT transaction (AM*) transactions  to  inform  retail  and  wholesale  sources  of  supply  of  base  requireme nt changes.  See Para  5.2.73 for the output  requisition  modifier  (AM*) transaction  format, and processing  instructions  related  to data element  changes. the  due-in /due-out  update  program. 5.2.70.2.1.  Automated  requisition  modifier  (AM*)  output  transaction.   Normally,  the requisition  modifier  document  is automatically  produced by the ILS-S when  significa nt changes  occur to established  requisitions.   See Para  5.2.71 for  processing  instruct io ns using   Subsequent  AM*  transactions  are automatically  produced  when  any  change  to  the  priority  designator  and/or  required delivery  date  (RDD)  occurs  due  to  unplanned  or  unforeseen  national  or  local emergencies.   When  the  emergency  no  longer  exists,  requisition  priorities  will  be downgraded  as  applicable  and  the  RDD  extended.    Additionally,  automated  AM* transactions  are produced  when  there  is  any  change  to the  due-in  detail  supplementar y address  or requisition  advice  code.  Lastly,  automated  AM* transactions  are prepared when  any  change  to  the  due-out  detail  FAD  or UJC  that  forces  a priority  designator change  on  the  due-in  detail.   See  Para  5.2.73  for  AM*  transaction  processing instructions. 5.2.70.2.2.  Manual  requisition  modifier  (AM*)  output  transaction.    Due-in/due- o ut (DIT)  update  programs  automatically  produce  AM*  transactions that  contain  the 482 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 routing  identifier  code (RIC)  from  the  due-in  detail.   However,  when  the  last  known source of supply  is not equal  to the due-in  detail  RIC, AFMC-R Stock Control  Activit y must  manually  prepare  and  process  a requisition  modifier  output  (AM*)  transaction.   See  Para  5.2.73  for  the  AM*  transaction  format.    See  Para  5.2.74  for  additiona l information  concerning  processing  requisition  modifier  (AM*) transactions  in  the ILS-S. 5.2.70.3.  Modification  of Lateral  Support  Requisitions.   When  a lateral  requisition  due- in is  updated,  an  (AM*  transaction  is  produced  by  the  requisitioning  base  and  sent  to  the lateral  support  base.  At  the  lateral  support  base, the  AM* transaction  is  input to the  ILS-S.  Next, the system  internally  converts  the AM* modifier  transaction  to a DIT transaction.   During  the DIT transaction  processing,  the system  checks for a matching  lateral  requisit io n shipment  suspense  detail.    If  a  matching  shipment  suspense  detail  with  Transportatio n Control  Number  (TCN) type  shipment  data is found,  the  ILS-S produces a shipment  status (AS1)  transaction  for  the  requisitioning  base.   If  a shipment  suspense  detail  is  found  but lacks transportation  data, a MILSTRIP  status  (AE1) transaction  with  BA status  is produced for the  requisitioning  base.  Note:   ILS-S programs  that  process AM* transactions  use the input  routing  identifier  to find  the  lateral  support  shipment  suspense  detail  regardless  of the  input  system  designator.   If  the  shipment  suspense  detail  is  not  found,  a MILSTRIP status  (AE*)  transaction  is  produced  with  status  code  BF  (no  record)  and  sent  to  the requisitioning  base.  See Para  5.2.88 for  more  information  concerning  BF status. 5.2.70.4.  Source  of  Supply  Action  on  Requisition  Modifier  (AM*)  Transactions.    The source  of  supply  will  modify  requisitions  in  the  wholesale  supply  system  after  receiving AM* modifier  transactions.   However,  the source of supply  will  only  modify  the requisit io n provided  the  requested  change(s)  are  authorized.    Any  unauthorized  changes  will  be ignored.   If  an AM* transaction  is received  and the requisition  number  is not  on file  in  the wholesale  supply  system,  the  modifier  (AM*) transaction  is  treated in  the same  manner  as a requisition  reinstatement  (AT*)  transaction.   Ultimately,  the  wholesale  supply  activit y will  reinstate  the  requisition  as a result  of  this  process. 5.2.71.  Due-In/Due-Out  Modifier  (DIT) Input  Transaction. 5.2.71.1.  Purpose.    The  Due-in/Due-out  modifier  (DIT)  transaction  is  used  to  modify multiple  fields  on ILS-S due-in  and due-out  details. required  delivery  date;  special 5.2.71.2.  Requisition  Data  Eligible  for  Modification.    DIT  transactions  can  be  used  to change  any  or  all  of  the  following  requisition  (due-in  detail)  data:   project  code; priority designator; linked  due-out document  number;  requisition  advice  code; and the supplementary  address.  (Use the NOR E  transaction  to update  the  delivery  destination,  supp  address,  advice  code, project  code, FAD for MICAP due-ins).   Note:   DITs are authorized  to be processed for Memo  MICAP due-outs. requirements indicator; 5.2.71.2.1.  Customer  Request  Data Eligible  for Modification.   DIT  transactions  can be used  to  change  any  or  all  of  the  following  customer  request  (due-out  detail)  data:   transaction  exception  code;  authority force  activity  designator; supplementary  address;  due-in  detail  document  number;  urgency  justification  code; and the  mark-for. issue  flag; for AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 483 5.2.71.2.2.

If  the  input  is processed through  a remote  terminal,  reject messages  or I006 MGT will  be printed  and output  at the  input  terminal. 5.2.71.2.3.  ILS-S Processing  of Requisition  Modifiers.   See Para 5.2.74 for the effects, processing  procedures,  and requisition  modifier  (AM*)  transactions  produced,  for  the different  types  of requisition  data that  may  be changed  by DIT  transaction  processing. 5.2.71.3.

If  the due-in  detail  is not  for  an unsupportable  Mobility  Readiness  Spares Package (MRSP)  or In-Place  Readiness  Spares Package (IRSP)  item,  and the  due-in  source  of  supply  is  AFMC, the  RDD  cannot  be blanked. b.  If  the due-out  has been  obligated,  the  due-in  requisition  number  on the  due-out detail  cannot  be blanked. c.  If  the type  organization  code is  7, 8, 9, A, B, G, I, or V, and the  activity  code is not S, M, U, or W, the mark-for  field  of  due-out  cannot  be blanked. d.  If  the signal  code on the due-in  detail  is other  than  A, C, or D, then  the due-in supplementary  address will  not  be blanked. 6.  Project Code.  The  due-out  detail  will  be designated  with  a TEX  O if  the following  conditions  apply:   1) the  input  project code is  9** (Joint  Chiefs  of Staff/Office  of  the Secretary  of Defense  requirement),  and 2) the current  due-out TEX  code is  not a 1, 8, H, U, or X.  If the  due-in  project code is  deleted  or changed from  a 9** project  code, the TEX  code O will  be blanked.   The  NOR E transaction will  be used to update the  project code for MICAP due-ins. 7.  Authority  for  Issue  (AI) Flag.

If  you  blank  the supplementary address, make  sure the  signal  code is  A, C, or D. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 485 9.  When  changing  the equipment  ID on due-outs,  enter  the  new equipment  ID in positions  67-73. 10.  Supplementary  Address (Due-Out  Detail).   If  a change  is  desired  and the  due-out detail  is  for an activity  assigned  type organization  code A or B (Civil  Engineer), this  field  must  contain  a valid  Civil  Engineer  work order number.   If  a change  is desired  and the  due-out  detail  is  for  a Vehicle  Maintenance  organization,  this  field must  contain  a valid  Vehicle  Maintenance  work order number  and  change  code. 11.  Enter  a valid  due-out  document  number  (positions  44-57) to change  a memo due-out.   If  positions  36-43 contain  a requisition  number,  the  due-out  document number  will  be stored in  the  due-in  detail,  the requisition  number  will  be stored  in the  due-out detail,  and the  due-in  priority  will  be modified  to correspond  to the  due-out detail  UJC and  the FAD. 12.  Urgency  Justification  Code (UJC) and Required  Delivery  Date (RDD). a.  If  the due-out  detail  contains  a Mission  Capability  (MICAP) UJC, which  is designated  by a first  position  1, J, or / (excluding  1T and 1Z), changes  to the  detail mark-for,  UJC, or due-in  fields  must  be made  with  a TRIC NOR.   b.

If  the DIT  input  or due-in  detail contains  a due-out  document  number,  this  field  must  be blank  and priority  changes must  be made  to the  due-out  detail  UJC and/or  (FAD).  The  ILS-S will  convert these  to a requisition  priority.   If  the DIT  input  and due-in  detail  do not  contain  a due-out  document  number,  this  field  must  contain  priority  11-15, 99, or blanks.   If a requisition  override  applies,  this  field  may  contain  any  priority  that  is equal  to or greater  than  the  override  priority. 14.  Exception  Data Code.  If  exception  data are required  on the  output  requisition modifier  (AM*),  enter  an E in  this  field.   If  no output  requisition  modifier  is desired,  enter  an X.  Any  other  entry  in  this  field  will  be ignored. 15.  Mark-For Data (positions  67-80).  If  a change  is  desired  to mark-for  data, enter the  new data in  positions  67-80 in  the  same configuration.   If the  SRD and work unit  code is  changed  on a due-out,  this  data will  also  be automatically  changed  on corresponding  DIFM details. 16.  System  Designator.   Enter  the  system  designator  of the  due-in  or due-out  detail being  updated. 17.  System  Designator.   Enter  the  system  designator  of the  DIFM detail  when  the system  designators  of  the due-out  detail  and corresponding  DIFM detail  are different. 486 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 18.  Enter  Y in  position  81 to bypass the  edit  for  the end item  document  number.   Only  authorized  for use  after  receipt  of  a 260 reject and  the AWP end item  is  no longer  loaded. 5.2.72.  Awaiting  Parts  (AWP)  UJC/TEX/Mark-For  Decision Table. 5.2.72.1.  Purpose.   To show  the  affect  DIT  processing  has on  awaiting  parts (AWP)  due-out  detail  urgency  justification  code  (UJC),  transaction  exception  code  (TEX),  and  the mark-for  data fields. 5.2.72.2.  How to Read Table 5.74.  The  first  action  is to find  the Current Detail Data rows which  correspond  to the  actual  detail  to be changed.   Within  these  rows,  find  the  one row which  has  the  Desired  Detail  Data  values  that  correspond  to  what  the  due-out  is  to  be changed  to.   The  DIT  Input  Data  for  that  row will  show  what  DIT  input  will  change  the Current  Detail  Data  to the  Desired  Detail  Data.  For example,  the  first  row shows  how  to change  a detail  with  a UJC of AR, a blank  TEX  code, and DIFM document  number  mark-for into  a detail  with  a UJC of AR, a blank  TEX code, and a new DIFM document  number.   Simply  enter the DIT  input  of a blank  UJC, a TEX code of 5, and the new  DIFM document number. 5.2.72.3.  Reporting  Changes  to AWP Due-In  and  Due-Out  Details.   When  the  DIT  input is  processed  (thus  changing  an existing  due-out  from  a non-AWP  UJC to AWP  UJC AR or  BR),  a  B9(*)  AWP  “Start”  report  transaction  will  be  produced.    When  changing  an existing  due-out  from  AWP  UJC  AR  or  BR  to  a non-AWP  UJC,  a  B9(*)  AWP  “Stop” reporting  transaction  will  be produced.   Note:   If  the  DIT  input  contains  both  a due-out document  number  and  a requisition  number,  the due-in  and due-out  details  will  be linked.   To unlink  due-in  and  due-out  details,  process  a DIT  input  with  an  asterisk  (*)  in  position 36 or 67.  This  will  also change  the due-out  detail  to memo.

To notify  DoD or Air  Force sources  of supply  of changes  to the priority and/or  required  delivery  date  fields  on  existing  ILS-S  requisitions.   The  requisit io n modifier is  sent  to  any  authorized  supply  source  when  changes  require transaction expedited  processing. 5.2.73.2.  Priority  Designator.   If DIT  processing  results  in  the  upgrade  of a customer  due-out detail  UJC, the  ILS-S will  automatically  upgrade  the related  requisition  (due-in)  detail using  the FAD and UND. 5.2.73.3.

Effects Of Processing Requisition  Modifier  (DIT) Transactions. 5.2.74.1.  Purpose.    To  explain  the  effects  of  processing  due-in/due-out  (DIT)  change transactions.   Additionally,  this  section  explains  the  processing  of  subsequent  requisit io n modifier  (AM*)  transactions. 5.2.74.2.  DIT  Transaction  Processing  Effects.   Internally,  the  ILS-S produces  changes  to due-in  or due-out  details. 5.2.74.2.1.  Due-In  and  No Associated  Due-Out.   If  the  DIT  input  is  to change  a due-in  detail  which  has  no  corresponding  due-out,  the  input  must  contain  a  requisit io n number  in  positions  36-43.  The  due-in  detail  will  be changed  to the  data  in  the  DIT input. 5.2.74.2.2.  Due-In  and  Associated  Due-Out.   If  DIT  processing  changes  a  due-in  or due-out  detail,  the  ILS-S will  automatically  update  the  corresponding  due-out  or due-in.    For  example,  if  the  due-out  Urgency  Justification  Code  (UJC)  is  changed,  the corresponding  due-in  priority  designator  will  be updated  as well. 5.2.74.2.3.  General  Changes  to Linked/Unlinked  Due-Ins  and Due-Outs.   To link  due-in  and  due-out  details  together,  the  DIT  input  must  contain  both  a due-in  and due-out document  numbers.   Conversely,  to unlink  due-in  and  due-out  details,  the  DIT  input will  contain  an  asterisk  (*)  in  position  36  (De-link  Due-in)  or  67 (De-link  Due-out).   Note:   Processing  DIT  transactions  to de-link  due-in  and  due-out  details  will  change the  due-out  detail  to  memo.   When  the  DIT  input  is  processed  (changing  an  existing due-out  from  a  non-AWP  UJC  to  UJC  AR  or  BR),  a  B9(*)  AWP  reporting  start transaction  will  be produced.  When  changing  an existing  due-out from  UJC AR or BR to  a non-AWP  UJC,  a B9(*)  AWP reporting  stop transaction  will  be produced.   See Para  5.2.72 for  a table  that  explains  DIT  processing  effects  for  AWP due-out  details. 5.2.74.2.4.  Priority  Changes  to  Due-In  Details.    If  DIT  transaction  processing  links due-in  and  due-out  details,  the  ILS-S  may  also  change  the  requisition  priority to correspond  with  the  due-out  detail.   When  due-in  and  due-out  details  are linked,  the ILS-S  will  automatically  use  the  due-out  detail  UND  and  FAD  to  compute  a  new requisition  priority.   Therefore,  the  possibility  exists  that  DIT  processing  may  change the  due-in  priority,  even  though  no  change  was  made  to  the  due-out  detail  UND  or FAD. 5.2.74.3.  Additional  DIT  Processing  Effects.   The  DIT  transaction  will  write  a change- to and a change-from  transaction  history  for priority  1-10 requisitions  which  have at least  one of the  following  fields  changed  after  DIT  processing:   due-in  project  code; due-in  priority; due-out  document  number;  required  delivery  date;  UJC;  or  FAD.    Note:      The  DIT transaction  will  automatically  update  the  due-in  detail  Date of  Last  Transaction  (DOLT), but it  will  not  change  the due-out  detail  or item  record DOLT.  Additionally,  if  the due-out detail  does not have  a linked  due-in  detail,  the ILS-S will  fill  the  due-in  quantity  field  with a nine  (9) in  each position. 492 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.2.74.3.1.  Requisition  Priority  Upgrade.   If  DIT  processing  results  in  the  upgrade  of a  due-out  detail  UND,  it  will  also  automatically  upgrade  the  related  item  record Stockage  Priority  Code (SPC), if  applicable.   Note:   DIT  processing  will  never  result in  the downgrading  of an item  record SPC.  See Ch 2 for more  information  concerning SPC assignment. 5.2.74.3.2.  Requisition  Priority  Downgrade.   If  a  due-in  detail  exists  without  a corresponding  (linked)  due-out  detail,  the  ILS-S  will  automatically  downgrade  the requisition  priority  as required.   If the item  is an Economic  Order Quantity  (EOQ) item, the  requisition  will  be downgraded  to priority  11 through  15.  Repair  cycle  (ERRCD XD*/XF*)  items  with  six  (6) or more  demands,  zero (0) Percent  of Base Repair  (PBR), and no on-hand  assets will  be downgraded  to priority  09.  All  other repair  cycle  due- in details  will  be downgraded  to priority  11 through  15. 5.2.74.4.  Updating  Lateral  Support  Details.    When  a  lateral  requisition  due-in  detail  is modified,  an AM* modifier  transaction  is output  and sent to the  lateral  base.  At the lateral base,  the  AM*  transaction  is  input  and  the  ILS-S internally  changes  the  AM*  to  a  DIT transaction  input.    DIT  processing  checks  for  a matching  lateral  requisition  due-out  or a shipment  suspense  detail.    If  a  matching  lateral  requisition  due-out  is  found,  the  ILS-S compares  the  due-out  data to the  DIT  input  for  possible  changes.   If  a matching  shipment suspense  detail  is  found  containing  shipment  data,  the  ILS-S produces  a shipment  status (AS1)  transaction.   If  the  shipment  suspense  detail  exists  without  shipment  data,  a status (AE*)  transaction  with  BA  status  is  produced.   The  transactions  are  then  sent  back to the requisitioning  base. 5.2.75.  Requisition  Modifier  (AM*) Transaction. 5.2.75.1.  Requisition  modifier  (AM*) transactions  are used to increase  or decrease priority designators,  and change  required  delivery  dates in  previously  submitted  requisitions. 5.2.75.2.  Requisition  Quantity  Change.    Do  not  submit  requisition  modifier  (AM*)  transactions  to change  requisition  quantities.   The correct course of action  for this  condition is  to request  due-in  cancellation  (AC1), process  cancellation  status  (AE*)  on the  existing requisition,  and  submit  a new  requisition  for  a new  quantity  and document  number. 5.2.75.3.  Automated  Preparation  of  Modifier the requisition  modifier  (AM*) transaction  is automatically  produced  by the ILS-S by the due-in/due-out  (DIT)  update  program  when  any  change  to the  priority  designator  and/or  RDD occurs.    Note:      The  requisition  modifier  (AM*)  transaction  is  also  used  to  notify  the wholesale  supply  system  of any  changes  to the  supplementary  address and/or advice  code. (AM*)  Transactions.   Normally, 5.2.75.4.  Manual  Preparation  of  Modifier  (AM*)  Transactions.  ILS-S  due-in  detail update  programs  automatically  produce  requisition  modifier  (AM*)  transactions containing  the  due-in  detail  Routing  Identifier  Code  (RIC).  However,  when  the  last known  source  of  supply  is  not  equal  to the  due-in  detail  RIC due  to passing  (BL/BM) status,  AFMC  must  manually  prepare  and  transmit  a  requisition  modifier  (AM*) transaction  to the  new  RIC. See Para 5.2.73 for  the  AM*  modifier  transaction  format and instructions.  In general,  the AM* transaction  is manually  prepared using  applicable information  from  the  original  requisition.  AFMC will  change  the  document  identifier code, routing  identifier  code, priority  designator,  and/or  required  delivery  date (RDD) AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 493 as required.  The requisition  modifier  (AM*) transaction  is always  sent to the last  known source  of supply.  Lastly,  a DIT  transaction  may  be processed  with  an X in  position  65 when  a requisition  modifier  (AM*) transaction  is not required.  See Para 5.2.71 for DIT transaction  format  and processing  instructions. 5.2.75.5.  Requisition  Modifier  (AM*)  Transaction  Document  Identifier  Code  (DIC).  Table  5.76  identifies  appropriate  modifier  transaction  DIC  for  CONUS and  OCONUS retail  Materiel  Management  Activity  locations. Table 5.76.

Requisition  upgrade/downgrade  with  a part number. Requisition  upgrade/downgrade  with  other  than an NSN or part number. Requisition  upgrade/downgrade  with  exception data. 5.2.75.6.  Source  of  Supply  Processing.   After  the  source  of  supply  receives  requisit io n modifier  (AM*)  transactions,  the  wholesale  supply  system  modifies  the  requisition  as necessary  provided  the  requested  changes  are authorized.   Unauthorized  changes  will  be ignored.   If  a requisition  modifier  (AM*)  transaction  is  received  by  the  wholesale  supply system,  but  the  complete  14-position  requisition  number  is  not  on  file,  the  requisit io n modifier (AT*) transactions. transaction  will  be  treated  the  same  as  requisition reinstatement 5.2.76.  MICAP Notification/Status  (NOR) Transaction.   The  NOR  transaction 5.2.76.1.  Purpose.   To explain  the  processing  and usage  of  the  MICAP notification/st at us (NOR)  transaction. is  used  to  initiate  MICAP  report  (B9M) transactions  for  MICAP  incidents,  changes,  cannibalization  actions,  transfers,  and  make internal  corrections that  are  not  processed  automatically  by  the  ILS-S.    The  NOR transaction  is used to upgrade,  downgrade,  or change  applicable  MICAP due-in  or due-out detail  records  in  the  ILS-S.  Note:   When  NOR transactions  are successfully  processed, ILS-S transaction  history  records are created and stored.  Only  the NOR Transaction  should be used to modify  MICAP requisitions  and/or due-outs. 5.2.76.2.  MICAP Action  Date  and Time.   The  MICAP action  date and  time  elements  are required  on  MICAP  notification  (NOR)  input  transactions  and  output  MICAP  report (B9M) transactions  as described  in  Para 5.2.30.  The MICAP action  date is the  actual  date and time  that  base maintenance  determined  a MICAP condition  occurred--not  the date and time  the  MICAP  transactions  or  reports  were  prepared  and  processed  by  the  Mission Support  section.   For  example,  if  an  item  was  cannibalized  from  an  aircraft  on  Saturday morning  at  0200, and  the  cannibalization  (NOR)  transaction  was  not  processed  until  the following  Monday,  the  correct  action  date would  be Saturday,  and  the  action  time  would be 0200 or hour  code C.  Another  example  concerns  MICAP  delete  code 9 cancellatio ns.   494 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 If  a corrected  MICAP  report  is  to be resubmitted,  the  action  date  and  time  should  be the date and  time  of  the  original  MICAP occurrence--not  when  the  MICAP cancellation  was processed.  This  will  ensure  that  erroneous  MICAP hours  are backed out of D165B. 5.2.76.3.  Input  Restrictions.   RPS/main  system  or MICAP terminal. 5.2.76.4.  Output.

To  explain  ILS-S  automated  (inline)  follow-up  processing procedures. 5.2.77.2.  ILS-S  Eligible  Records.    The  following  ILS-S  details  are  checked  by  the automated  (inline)  follow-up  program  and  contain  follow-up  schedules  listed  in  this section.    Note:      ILS-S  due-in  details  containing  Project  Code  175  are  excluded  from automated  follow-up  processing.   Note:      Project  Code  175  requires  MAJCOM authorization.   MAJCOMs will  provide  follow-up  criteria  for  these  due-in  details. 5.2.77.2.1.  Due-In  Details. 5.2.77.2.2.  Shipment  Status  Details.    The  automated  follow-up  program  will  create follow-up  transactions  for  shipment  status  details  that  are overdue  based  on  Militar y Standard  Transportation  and Movement  Priority  (MILSTAMP)  standards. 5.2.77.3.  The  Automated  (Inline)  Follow-up  Program.   The  automated  (inline)  follow- up program  should  be  processed  daily  to ensure  there  is  equitable  distribution  of  follow - up (AF*)  transactions  for  wholesale  sources  of  supply  and  items  requisitioned  through  Base Contracting.   The  follow- up  program  logic  provides  follow-up  action  on  due-in,  excess, shipment shipped-not-credited,  unserviceable  Due-In-From-Maintena nce (DIFM),  and DIFM details  that  exceed the  age criteria. suspense, 5.2.77.3.1.

Follow-up  transactions for  due-in  details  that  do  not  contain  status  are  created  depending  upon  the  Media  and Status  (M&S)  code  and  priority  designator  assigned.    Initial  and  subsequent  follow- up transactions  for  due-in  details  without  status  will  contain  document  identifier  code AT* as depicted  in  Table 5.87. Table 5.87.  Follow-up  Transaction  Document  Identifier  Codes.

Follow-up for  Service-Managed  Due-In  Details  Without  Status.   Automated  follow-up  processing  schedules  depend  upon  the  source  of  supply, requisition  priority,  and  whether  or not  any  status  is  recorded.   This  section  concerns follow-ups  for  due-in  details  without  supply  status  for  AFMC,  DLA,  GSA,  other Service-managed items,  and  items  requisitioned  from  lateral  (D**)  series  routing identifier  codes.  Due-in  details  without  status  are categorized  in  the ILS-S as described in  the following  paragraphs.   Note:   Processing  schedules  for  ILS-S follow-up  for due-in  details  without  status  will  be  based  upon  the  type  of  supply  status  and  priority designator. 5.2.77.4.1.1.  100  Percent  Status  Required.   Media  and  status  (M&S)  codes  that designate  100 percent  status  is required  are B, C, D, E, F, G, S, T, U, V, W, and X.  See  Para  5.2.38.  for  more  information  concerning  M&S  coding  on  ILS-S requisitions.    If  100  percent  status  is  required,  automated  follow-up  transactions will  be created by the  ILS-S as follows: 5.2.77.4.1.1.1.  Requisition  Priorities  01-08.   A  follow-up  (AT*)  transaction will  be produced  4 days after  the  date the  requisition  was created. 5.2.77.4.1.1.2.  Requisition  Priorities  09-15.   A  follow-up  (AT*)  transaction will  be produced  8 days after  the  date the  requisition  was created. 5.2.77.4.1.2.  Exception  Status.    Media  and  status  (M&S)  codes  that  specify exception  supply  status  are:  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, K, L, M, N, R, and P.  For due-in  details without  status  and exception  supply  status  is  required,  the ILS-S creates follow- up (AT*)  transactions  according  to the  following  schedule: 5.2.77.4.1.2.1.  Requisition  Priorities  01-03.   A  follow-up  (AT*)  transaction will  be produced  7 days after  the  requisition  was created. 5.2.77.4.1.2.2.  Requisition  Priorities  04-08.   A  follow-up  (AT*)  transaction 508 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 will  be produced  9 days after  the  requisition  was created. 5.2.77.4.1.2.3.  Requisition  Priorities  09-15.   A  follow-up  (AT*)  transaction will  be produced  22 days after  the  requisition  was created. 5.2.77.4.1.3.  Non-NSN and/or  REX  Code 5  Assigned.   If  the  fifth  position  of  a due-in  stock  number  is  alpha,  then  the  item  does  not  contain  a  National  Stock Number  (NSN).   Initial  follow-up  (AT*)  transactions  for  due-in  details  without status  that  contain  a non-NSN stock number  and/or  items  that  contain  a REX  code 5 are created under  the  following  schedules: 5.2.77.4.1.3.1.  Requisition  Priority  01-03.  A follow-up  (AT*) transaction  will be produced  10 days after  the  requisition  was created. 5.2.77.4.1.3.2.  Requisition  Priority  04-08.  A follow-up  (AT*) transaction  will be produced  15 days after  the  requisition  was created. 5.2.77.4.1.3.3.  Requisition  Priority  09-15.  A follow-up  (AT*) transaction  will be produced  20 days after  the  requisition  was created. 5.2.77.4.1.4.  Status  (Follow-up)  Counter  Update.   The  ILS-S attempts  to acquire supply  status  from  supply  sources by producing  a variety  of follow-up  transactions.   Normally,  when  follow-up  transactions  are required,  the ILS-S produces follow- up output  transactions  and creates new status  details.   For due-in  details  without  status, the ILS-S creates a status  detail  and changes  the current  status  field  and date on the status  detail  to “99”.   Status  codes 9* are termed  status counters.   The status  counter identifies  the  number  of  follow-up  transactions  produced  for  requisitions  without status  until  MILSTRIP  status  is received.   The  status  counter  begins  with  99 for  the first  follow-up  and is  reduced by one (1) for each subsequent  follow-up  transaction produced.   For example,  on the  second  follow-up  of a due-in  detail  without  status, the  status  counter  is  reduced  to 98, third  follow-up  reduced  to 97, etc.  Depending on the priority  of the requisition,  the  due-in  detail  will  either  be deleted  by the ILS-S  after  three  follow-up  transactions  with  no  response,  or  the  status  counter  will continue  to be reduced  by one.   Note:   After  two (2) follow-up  transactions  have been  produced  for  priority  (01-08) due-in  details  without  status,  the  ILS-S creates an  Action  Required  (ARC)  transaction  for  manual  review  and  update.   See  Para 5.2.78 for  ARC transaction  format  and processing  instructions. 5.2.77.4.2.  Follow-up  for  Service-Managed  and  Lateral  Due-In  Details  With  Status (Other  Than  Cancellation  Request  (B9/ZC/ZD)  Status).    The  following  paragraphs concern  follow-up  processing  for  Service-managed  and  lateral  support  (D**)  series routing  identifier  code due-in  details  containing  supply  status  other  than  cancellat io n request  (B9/ZC/ZD)  status.   Automated  (inline)  follow-up  transactions  are produced as follows: 5.2.77.4.2.1.  Initial  Follow-up.    Follow-up  (AF*)  transactions  will  be created  by the  ILS-S using  the  following  schedules: 5.2.77.4.2.1.1.  Requisition  Priorities  01-08.    A  follow-up  (AF*)  transaction will  be produced  3 days after  the  Estimated  Delivery  Date (EDD). 5.2.77.4.2.1.2.  Requisition  Priorities  09-15.    A  follow-up  (AF*)  transaction AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 509 will  be produced  6 days after  the  EDD. 5.2.77.4.2.2.  Subsequent  Follow-up.    Subsequent  follow-up  (AF*)  transactions will  be based on the  status  detail's  Date of  Last Transaction  (DOLT)  as follows: 5.2.77.4.2.2.1.  Requisition  Priorities  01-03.  Action  Required  (ARC)  follow-up transactions  are produced  every  5 days until  offline  action  is taken. 5.2.77.4.2.2.2.  Requisition  Priorities  04-08.    The  second  follow-up  (AF*) transaction  will  be  produced  5  days  after  the  first  follow- up.    Subsequent follow-up  transactions  will  be produced  in  the  ARC  format.   ARC  follow- up transactions  will  be produced  every  5 days until  offline  action  is  taken. 5.2.77.4.2.2.3.  Requisition  Priorities  09-15.   The  second  and  third  follow- up (AF*) transactions  will  be created 10 days after  the  first  follow-up.   If no reply is  received  from  the  first,  second,  or third  follow-up  transaction,  and  no  due-outs or ISSL/NASSL/MSSL  details  exist,  the ILS-S will  delete  the due-in  detail with  status  code  Z7.    Additionally,  the  item  record  will  be  flagged  for  re-leveling  action.   See Ch 2 for  more  information  on  re-leveling.   Note:   If  AE* status  is  received,  the  follow-up  counter  will  be shifted  to  the  previous  status field  and the  follow-up  will  be restarted  based on the revised  EDD. 5.2.77.4.3.  Follow-up for  Service-Managed  and  Lateral  Due-In  Details  With Cancellation  Request  (B9/ZC/ZD)  Status.   The  ILS-S produces  follow-up  transactions for  Service-managed  and lateral  support  due-in  details  that  contain  due-in  cancellat io n request  (B9/ZC/ZD)  status.   Automated  (inline)  follow-up  transactions  are created  by the  ILS-S as follows: 5.2.77.4.3.1.  Request  for  Due-In  Cancellation  Follow-up  (AK*) Transaction.   If  a MILSTRIP  cancellation  status  (AE*)  transaction is  not  received  for  a  due- in cancellation  request  (AC*) transaction,  a request  for  due-in  cancellation  follow- up (AK1)  transaction  will  be produced  when  the  status  detail  date  of  last  transaction (DOLT)  is  greater  than  9  days.   A  second  cancellation  request  follow-up  (AK*) transaction  will  be created 10 days after  the first  follow-up  transaction  is  produced.  See Para 5.2.92 for AC* and AK* transaction  formats  and processing  instructio ns.  5.2.77.4.3.2.  Automatic  Due-in  Detail  Deletion.   If  no  status  reply  is  received  to the  second follow- up  requisition  cancellation  request  follow-up  (AK*) transaction for  a  routine  (09-15)  requisition,  the  ILS-S  will  create  and  process  a MILSTRIP status  (AE*)  transaction  with  status  code Z7.   See  Para’s   5.2.78  and   5.2.88 for more  information  concerning  Z7 status  code.  The  ILS-S will  delete  the due-in  and all  corresponding  status  details.    Note:     If  a  Billed-Not-Received  (BNR)  detail exists  when  the  due-in  detail  is  deleted,  the  ILS-S will  create a Claims  Receivable (CR) detail  if  the  item  is  part of an Other Service  Stock Fund  (OSSF)/ DLA  with  a value  greater  than  $100, or a GSA item  with  a value  greater  than  $25. 5.2.77.5.  Action  Required  (ARC)  Transaction/Status  Counter.  Action  Required  (ARC) transactions  containing  AT* (reinstatement)  in  positions  71-73 are produced in  SIFS when normal  follow-up  (AF*) transactions  have  failed  to obtain  required  status  from  Air  Force, DLA,  GSA, or other  Service  sources of supply.  Additionally,  the ILS-S automated  (inline) follow-up  program  will  produce  ARC  transactions  and  status  counters  using  the  same 510 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 methodology  for  local  purchase  due-in  details.  For priority  designators  01-08 requisit io ns with  corresponding  status  details,  the ILS-S produces ARC transactions  and status  counters on the third  follow-up  attempt.  ARC transactions  and status  counters  are also produced  for priority  designators  09-15  requisitions  with  corresponding  status  details  on  the  fourth follow-up  attempt. 5.2.77.5.1.  ARC  Transaction  and  Status  Counters  Processing.  Perform  one  of  two following  actions: 5.2.77.5.1.1.  Retrieve  ARC  transactions  from  SIFS  and  change  the  document identifier  code (DIC). If the due-in  is still  valid,  blank  positions  71-73 and enter  the appropriate  requisition  reinstatement  (AT*)  document  identifier  code  (DIC)  as shown  in  the  Table  5.87 5.2.77.5.1.2.  Requisition  reinstatement.  If  the  document  date  for  a requisition  is less  than  120 days  old, submission  of  a requisition  reinstatement  (AT*)  follow - up transaction  will  cause  the  source  of  supply  to reinstate  the  requisitio n  and provide MILSTRIP  status.    Note:    Be  careful  when  submitting  requisition  reinstate me nt (AT*)  follow-up  transactions  because  they  may  result  in  duplicate  shipments  and billings. 5.2.77.5.1.3.  Requisition  cancellation  request.  If the requirement  for the requisit io n no longer  exists,  submit  a requisition  cancellation  request  (AC1) transaction  to the source  of supply. 5.2.77.5.1.4.  Retrieve Status counter  from  ILS-S comparable  query. 5.2.77.5.1.4.1.  Query  the  requisition  with  applicable  Source  of  Supply  (SOS).  If still valid  with  acceptable status, process AE*. 5.2.77.5.1.4.2.  If still  valid  with  unacceptable  status, engage with  SOS for improved  status. 5.2.77.5.1.4.3.  If requisition  is no longer valid and the document  date is less than  120 days old, either submit  a requisition  reinstatement  (AT*)  follow-up  transaction  to the SOS or cancel original  requisition  and  submit  new. 5.2.77.5.1.4.4.  If  requisition  is  no  longer  valid  and  the  document  date  is equal  to  or  greater  than  120  days  old,  cancel  original  requisition  and submit  new. 5.2.77.6.  Lateral  Support  Requisition  Follow-up.    Lateral  support  due-in  details  are designated  by  routing  identifier  codes  JLS  or  D**.    The  ILS-S  creates  initial  follow- up transactions  for  lateral  support  requisitions  according  to the  following  schedules: 5.2.77.6.1.  Requisition  Priority  01-08. programmatically  produced 25 days  after  the  requisition  date. follow-up   A (AF*) transaction is 5.2.77.6.2.  Requisition  Priority  09-15. is programmatically  produced  35 days  after  the  requisition  date.  Subsequent  follow- ups will  be in  the  form  of action  required  (ARC)  transactions. transaction follow-up   A (AF*) 5.2.77.7.  Local  Purchase  Requisition  Follow-up. (AF*)  and reinstatement  (AT*) transactions  are also produced by the ILS-S for Standard Procurement   Requisition  follow-up AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 511 System  (SPS) local  purchase  items.   The  type  of follow- up  transaction  produced  depends upon  the  priority  of  the  requisition  and whether  the  status  detail  contains  status.   Follow -up transactions  will  be produced  as follows: 5.2.77.7.1.  Local  Purchase  Requisitions  Without  Status.   The  ILS-S will  create  init ia l follow-up  (AT*)  transactions  for  local  purchase  requisitions  as  shown  in  Table  5.88.  If  a local  purchase  due-in  detail  reflects  an  NSN, or  the  item  contains  a REX  code 5 item,  and no status  detail  exists,  the ILS-S will  output  a requisition  reinstatement  (AT*) transaction.   The  date of  the  follow-up  will  be based on the  priority  group,  requisit io n date, and DOLT. Table 5.88.  Local Purchase  Requisition  (Without  Status) Follow-up  Transaction Frequency.

Local  Purchase  Requisitions  With  Status.    The  ILS-S  will  create  (AF*) and/or  subsequent  (ARC)  follow-up transactions  for  local  purchase  due-in  details containing  supply  status  other  than  B9,  ZC,  and  ZD  (cancellation  request)  status  as shown  in  Table  5.89.  The  date of  the  follow-up  will  be based  on  the  priority  group, EDD,  and DOLT. Table 5.89.  Local Purchase  Requisition  (With  Status) Follow-up  Transaction  Frequency.

Local  Purchase  Due-in  Details  With  Cancellation  Request  (B9/ZC/ZD) Status.    Request  for  cancellation  supply  status  for  local  purchase  due-in  details  is designated  by  cancellation  request  status  codes  B9,  ZC,  and  ZD.    The  first,  second (AK1),  and  subsequent  (ARC)  follow-up  transactions  for  local  purchase  requisit io n cancellation  requests  in  the  ILS-S will  be created  on  DOLT  +  10 days,  regardless  of priority  group. 5.2.77.7.4.  Action  Required  (ARC) Transaction  for Local  Purchase  Requisitions.   The LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  is  responsible  for    ARC  transactions  for  local purchase  requisitions,  routing  identifier  Jxx.   ARC transactions  are created on the third and  subsequent  follow-ups  for  local  purchase  requisitions.    Position  71  of  the  ARC transaction  will  be blank  and  positions  72-76 will  contain  the  purchase  order number.   If  Base  Contracting  has  not  replied  to  follow-up transactions  within  established schedules,  an  Action  Required  (ARC)  transaction  will  be  created  by  the  ILS-S  and 512 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 forwarded  to Stock Control  for processing.   Note:   The  Standard  Procurement  System (SPS)  does not  accept  ARC  transactions.   Therefore,  Customer  Service  must  change the  transaction  DIC to the  appropriate  follow- up  transaction  DIC  prior  to submiss io n to Base Contracting.   Customer  Service  will  contact Base Contracting  to obtain  current status  for  local  purchase  requisitions  that  have  produced  ARC output  transactions.   If the  local  purchase  requirement  no  longer  exists,  Customer  Service  will  process  local purchase  cancellation  (LCC) transactions  to cancel  local  purchase  due-in  details.   See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 3 for LCC transaction  format  and processing  instructio ns.   Local  procedures  will  be  established  between  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activit y Customer  Service  and Base Contracting  to ensure  prompt action  is taken on ILS-S local purchase  requisition  action  required  (ARC) transactions.   Once ARC transactions  have been  produced,  no other  automated  follow- up  (AF*)  transactions  will  be produced  by the ILS-S.  Note:   New ARC transactions  are programmatically  created every  10 days until  updated  status  is  processed  in  the  ILS-S,  or  local  purchase  requisitions  are canceled. 5.2.77.8.  Local  Manufacture  Follow-up  Process.    Local  manufacture  due-in  details  are designated  by  JBD,  JBI,  JBT,  and  JBE  routing  identifier  codes.  If  the  ILS-S determines follow-up  action  is  required,  an F458 MGT  notice  (Local  MFG D/I  Exists  W/O Required Status  or  Local  MFG  D/I  Cancelled)  will  be  produced.    The  ILS-S  will  create  an  F458 MGT  notice  for  any  local  manufacture  requisition  requiring  follow-up  regardless  of whether  status  exists  or not.  If status  does not exist,  an F458 MGT notice  will  be produced 10 days  after  the  requisition  was  created.   If  status  is  not  received  within  10 days  of  the first  follow-up,  a  second  follow-up  (F458  MGT  Notice)  will  be  created.    If  no  reply  is received  within  the 10 days  following  the second  follow-up,  automatic  cancellation  action will  be taken by the ILS-S, and another  F458 MGT notice  will  be produced.  If status  exits, the ILS-S will  create an F458 MGT notice  10 days after  expiration  of the EDD.   See  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more  information  and processing  instructions  for  F458 MGT notices. 5.2.78.  Requisition  Follow-Up  (AF*,  AFC,  ARC, AT*) Output  Transactions. 5.2.78.1.  Purpose.  To list  and explain  the various  ILS-S follow-up  transactions  produced.  ILS-S follow-up  transactions  are used  to obtain  initial  or improved  status,  or reinstate  the requisition  at the  source of  supply. 5.2.78.1.1.  AF(*)  Follow-up  Transaction.   The  AF*  follow-up  transaction  is  used  to obtain  updated  status  for  requisitions  containing  status. 5.2.78.1.2.  AFC  Follow-up  Transaction.   The  AFC  follow-up  transaction  is  used  to request  an  improved  Estimated  Availability  Date  (EAD)  or Estimated  Shipment  Date (ESD)  for  priority  01-08 requisitions  containing  status. 5.2.78.1.3.  AT(*)  Reinstatement  Transaction.   The  AT*  reinstatement  transaction  is used to obtain  initial  status  for due-in  details  that  do not contain  status. 5.2.78.1.4.  ARC  Follow-up  Transaction.    The  ARC  follow-up  transaction  is  used  to obtain  status  for  requisitions  that  have  not  received  status  from  sources  of  supply  or Base Contracting. 5.2.78.1.4.1.  ARC transactions  are not accepted or processed in  wholesale  or base AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 513 contracting  systems.    The  transaction  DIC must  be changed  before  transmiss io n.

Note:   Retail  materiel  manage me nt activities  are provided  status  based upon  the media  and status  (M&S) code assigned  to ILS-S requisitions. 5.2.87.2.  Media  and  Status  (M&S)  Code.  The  type  and  amount  of  status  produced  and provided  to  retail  materiel  management  activities  is  determined  by  the  media  and  status (M&S)  code used  on  the  requisition.   The  M&S code is  used  to tell  the  source  of  supply what  type  and amount  of status  to provide,  and when  to provide  it. 5.2.87.3.  DLATS  Status  Processing.   In  addition  to supply  sources  furnishing  status,  the DLATS  generates  status  as a result  of stock number  editing.   DLATS  furnishes  status  back to the  requisitioning  activity  using  the  unique  document  identifier  code (DIC)  AE9  status transaction. 5.2.87.4.  Types  of  Requisition  Status.   Sources  of  supply  provide  MILSTRIP  status  for each  submitted  requisition.    There  are  different  types  of  MILSTRIP  requisition  supply status  generated  at the  source  of supply:   Exception,  100 Percent,  Cancellation/Reject io n, Direct  Delivery  Notice,  Shipment,  and  Acknowledgement. the  ILS-S generates  two  types  of  status:    Cancellation  Request  and  Follow-up  status.    See  Para 5.2.87.7 for  complete  processing  procedures  for  each type  of status  processed  in  the  ILS-S.    See  Para  5.2.88  for  a  complete  list  of  requisition  status  codes  with  associated explanations.   Additionally, 5.2.87.4.1.  Exception  Supply  Status.  Exception  supply  status  is requested using  media and  status  (M&S)  codes  2, 3,  4, 5,  K, M, or  N on  the  requisition  (A0*)  transaction.   When  exception  supply  status  is  requested,  updated  status  in  the  form  of  AE* transactions  will  be  provided  when  exception-type  conditions  occur.    Examples  of exception-type  status  conditions  are:    Backorder;  Direct  Delivery;  Substitut io n; Passing,  and  Cancellation  Acknowledgement.    See  Para  5.2.89  for  the  MILSTRIP status  (AE*)  transaction  format  and processing  instructions. 5.2.87.4.2.  100% supply  status.   This  type of status  is provided  as a notice  of all  actions taken or being  taken by supply  sources on ILS-S requisitions.   This  includes  all  positive supply  action  decisions,  applicable  exception  non-positive  supply  action  decisions,  and combinations  thereof.   One  hundred  percent  status  is  automatically  requested  for  all priority  01-08 requisitions.   When  used,  bases are advised  of  any  changes  in  status  or actions  taken  by  the  source  of  supply.    The  ILS-S  creates  and  sends  follow- up transactions  (AF*) on requisitions  before  the  standard  delivery  date (SDD)  has  passed to reduce  most  of  the manual  workload  required. 5.2.87.4.3.  Cancellation/rejection  status.    Cancellation/rejection  status  has  the  worst effect  on  a  retail  Materiel  Management  Activity  in  terms  of  supplier  support.    A requisition  may  be  canceled  or  rejected  for  various  reasons.    For  example, the requisition  may  not  meet  system  requirements,  or  a logistical  situation  may  stop  the order from  being  filled  as described  in  the  following  paragraphs.  See AFMAN 23-122, Sec  5B,  Order  and  Requisitioning,  for  procedures  to  perform  status  updates  for cancellation/rejection  status. 524 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 reaches   When  a  requisitioned 5.2.87.4.4.  Intransit/shipment  status. the transportation  stage, intransit/shipment  status is provided  using  a shipment  status (AS*) transaction.   The  shipment  status  (AS*)  transaction  provides  the  LRS/  transportatio n activity  data  such  as mode  of  shipment  and  date  shipped  to update  requisition  status details.   See Para  5.2.90 for  shipment  status  (AS*)  transaction  format  and  processing instructions.   The  requisition  (due-in)  record should  remain  in  the ILS-S until  the  item is  physically  received  and  a receipt  transaction  is  processed at the  base.  If  the  receipt is not processed in  the ILS-S within  established  timeframe,  the ILS-S will  automatica l ly initiate the logistics  pipeline.   See AFMAN  23-122, Sec 5B,  Order and  Requisitioning  for  more information  concerning  the tracing  of overdue  requisitions. tracer  action  and  attempt  to  determine  shipment item location throughout 5.2.87.4.5.  Acknowledgement  status.   Acknowledgement  status  can be used to provide either  supply  or  shipment  status  to  the  requisitioning  base.    This  type  of  status  is provided  as  a  response  to  Material  Obligation  Validation  (MOV)  response  (AP*) transactions,  cancellation requisit io n modifier  (AM*) transactions,  and follow- up  request  for  improved  Estimated  Shipment Date (ESD)  transactions. (AC1/AK1)  transactions, request/follow- up 5.2.87.5.  Local  Purchase  Requisition  Status.    The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activit y manages  local  purchase  requisition  procedures  for  Standard  Procurement  System  (SPS).  Base  Contracting  will  assign  status  to  local  purchase  requisitions  for  input  to  the  ILS-S during  daily  (inline)  processing.    Base  Contracting  produces  a variety  of  local  purchase status  transactions  (with  local  purchase  coding)  to the ILS-S to update internal  records. See AFMAN 23-122,  Sec 3B, Local  Purchase  and Retail  Sales for  local  purchase  procedures. 5.2.87.6.  Field  manufacture  and  base  civil  engineer  (BCE)  local  manufacture  supply status.    A  separate  supply  status  (AE*)  transaction  is  prepared  and  processed  to  update  status  on  the  ILS-S  due-in  detail  for  the  local  manufactured  item.    See  Para  5.2.93  for status  (AE*)  transaction  format  and  processing  instructions  for  Field  Manufacture  units.   See  Para  5.2.94  for  AE*  transaction  format  and  processing  instructions  for  Base  Civil Engineering  units. 5.2.87.7.  Processing  ILS-S Requisition  Status. 5.2.87.7.1.  Status  (AE*)  Transaction.   The  ILS-S receives  and generates  supply  status from  DoD  and Air  Force sources  of  supply  via  MILSTRIP  status  (AE*)  transactions.   See  Para  5.2.89  for  MILSTRIP  status  (AE*)  transaction  format  and  processing instructions.   Additionally,  the  DLATS  subjects  base requisition  (A0*) transactions  to Air  Force-approved  edits  to  ensure  selected  requisition  data  elements  are  valid  and consistent.   Updates  resulting  from  DLATS  edits  are communicated  to the  ILS-S via AE*  transactions.    The  processing  of  AE*  transactions  results  in  the  programma t ic update  of requisition  data elements  in  the  due-in  detail  record (202). 5.2.87.7.2.  Processing  Cancellation/Rejection  Status.    Depending  on  the  status  code and situation,  different  actions  and transaction  exception  codes (TEX)  may  be required to complete  requisition  processing.   See Para 2.2.51 for procedures to cancel  push  due-ins  (99S). The  following  paragraphs  detail  specific  instructions  for processing  the most common  types  of  rejection/cancellation  status  you  will  receive.   See Para  5.2.88 for  a complete  list  and explanation  of each type of status  code that may  be received.  Manual AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 525 processing  procedures  for  status  codes  BF,  CA,  CW,  ZG,  and  ZH  are  located  in AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5B, Order and Requisitioning. 5.2.87.7.2.1.  Cancellation  Status Codes B4, BQ, BS, C6, CB, CD, FB, FC, FJ, and Z7.  The  ILS-S processes  AE* transaction  status  codes B4, BQ, BS, C6, CB, CD, FB, FC, FJ and Z7 as follows: 5.2.87.7.2.1.1.  If  a  customer  due-out  is  not  on  file,  the  due-in  detail  will  be deleted  and the  item  record flagged  for  releveling. 5.2.87.7.2.1.2.  If  a customer  due-out  is  on  file,  the  current  date  and  the  input status  code will  be stored  in  the  due-in  document  number  field  of  the  due-out detail.    The  205-MEMO-DUO-DESIGNATOR  will  be  changed  to  memo.   Note:      When  CB  status  (not  available)  is  processed,  an  F407  MGT  notice (Quantity  not  Available  for  Immediate  Release)  will  be  produced.   When  FJ status  (previous  MRO/RDO)  is processed, an F428 MGT notice  (Supply  Action Denied  MRO-RDO)  will  be output.   See   AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt  2, Ch  7 for more  information  concerning  F407 and F428 MGT notices. 5.2.87.7.2.2.  Cancellation  Status  Codes B6, B8,  and B9.    If  status  codes B6,  B8, or B9  are  processed  against  a due-in  when  no  request  for  cancellation  (AC*)  has been  produced,  an  F481 MGT  notice  (No Request  for  Cancellation  (ZC/ZD)  On File)  will  be  output.    See   AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt  2, Ch  7 for  more  informa t io n concerning  F481 MGT  notices. 5.2.87.7.2.3.  Cancellation  Status  Code CD (Error  Conditions  Exist).   If  CD status is  processed  and  no  request  for  requisition  cancellation  (ZC/ZD)  status  exists,  the ILS-S  will  automatically  prepare  a  SPR  input  transaction  for  re-requisitio ning action.    If  requisition  cancellation  request  status  (ZC/ZD)  exists,  the  ILS-S  will produce  a request  for  cancellation  (AC*) transaction. 5.2.87.7.2.4.  Cancellation  Status  Code CS (Excessive  Quantity).   The  ILS-S  will generate  a special  requisition  (SPR) transaction  with  a 2L  requisition  advice  code when  CS cancellation  status  is received  and either  of the following  conditions  exist: 5.2.87.7.2.4.1.  The  requisition  (due-in)  is  marked  for  a customer  due-out,  and only  a partial  of  the requisition  quantity  is  rejected. 5.2.87.7.2.4.2.  The  requisition  (due-in)  is  marked  for stock replenishment,  and the  rejected  quantity  either  equals  the  due-in  quantity  or  is  greater  than  the demand  level.   If  the  canceled  requisition  quantity  canceled  equals  the  due- in quantity  or  is  greater  than  the  demand  level,  the  ILS-S  will  generate  a F409 MGT notice  (QTY Field  or REQN Suspect of Error,  ReREQN).   See  AFH 23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  7    for  processing  instructions  concerning  F409  MGT notices. 5.2.87.7.2.5.  Cancellation  Status  Code ZR (Excessive  Value).   Cancellation  status code ZR indicates  the extended  dollar  value  of the item  is greater than  the maximum limit  authorized  for  the  item  on  a  federal  supply  schedule.   The  ILS-S  processes cancellation  status  code ZR as follows: 5.2.87.7.2.5.1.  If  the  retail  Materiel  Management  Activity  is  supported  by  an 526 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 automated  base  contracting  system,  such  as  Standard  Procurement  System (SPS), the  ILS-S will  automatically  generate  an SPR transaction  to requisit io n the  item  from  the  applicable  supply  source. 5.2.87.7.2.5.2.  If  a  nonautomated  base  contracting  system  applies,  or a  local purchase  status  detail  is on file,  a 433 REJ notice  (MILSTRIP  Status  Cannot Be Processed  Against  LP Requisitions)is  produced.   See  AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7  for processing  instructions. 5.2.87.7.3.  Exception  Supply  Status  Processing.   Exception  supply  status  is  requested through  the  use  of  media  and  status  (M&S) codes 2, 3, 4, 5, K, M, or N contained  on the  requisition  (A0*)  transaction.   When  exception  supply  status  is  requested,  updated status  in  the  form  of  AE*  status  transactions  will  be provided.   The  following  status conditions  are considered  exception  supply  status: 5.2.87.7.3.1.  BB Status.   Requisition  is  placed  on backorder. 5.2.87.7.3.2.  BV/BZ  Status.   Requisition  is  being  processed  for  procurement  and direct  delivery  from  a vendor  or contractor. 5.2.87.7.3.3.  BH Status.   A substitute  item  is being  provided. 5.2.87.7.3.4.  BM Status.   The  requisition  is  passed to another  source  of supply,  or any  referral  actions  have  been taken. 5.2.87.7.3.5.  Other  Status.    Any  other  circumstance  which  indicates  release  of required  material  may  not  be  made  within  the  time  period  established  for  the assigned  priority  designator. 5.2.87.7.3.6.  Restricted  Use and Limitations  of Exception  Status.  Exception  status should  be used  for,  but  limited  to, priority  09-15 requisitions  since  its  use reduces the  effectiveness  of  the  system’s  automatic  follow-up  process.   Exception  status prevents  the  ILS-S  from  performing  follow-up  on  requisitions  until  the  Standard Delivery  Date  (SDD)  has  passed.    See  AFMAN  23-122,  Sec  5B,  Order  and Requisitioning  for information  about  submitting  follow-ups  to the source  of supply through  the ILS-S. 5.2.87.7.3.7.  Requisitions  (Due-Ins)  with  Shipment  Status.    The  ILS-S  will  not cancel  a requisition  (due-in)  if  shipment  status  exists.   The  ILS-S will  disregard  the AE* status  transaction. 5.2.87.7.3.8.  All  Other  Cancellation  Status.    The  ILS-S  will  process  all  other cancellation  status  as follows: 5.2.87.7.3.8.1.  Due-in/Due-out/Status  Detail  Update.    The  ILS-S  will  delete due-in  and  all  associated  status  details  for  canceled  requisitions  without shipment  status.    If  a  customer  due-out  (DUO)  record  exists,  the  ILS-S  will change  the  due-out  to  memo,  blank  the  due-in  document  number,  store  the cancellation  status code in the last two positions  of the due-in  document  number field  of  the due-out  detail. 5.2.87.7.4.  Positive  Supply  Status.   The  ILS-S processes  positive  supply  status  codes received  as follows: AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 527 5.2.87.7.4.1.  Partial  Status  Transactions.    Each  partial  status  transaction  should contain  a suffix  code on  the  AE*  transaction.   If  the  input  AE*  status  transaction contains  a suffix  code, and the input  suffix  code equals  an existing  status  detail,  the ILS-S updates  the  existing  status  detail.   If  no  matching  status  detail  is  on  file  for the  requisition  number,  the  system  creates  a new  status  detail  using  the  input  data from  the suffixed  status  transaction.   After  initial  processing  is completed,  the  total quantity  on  the  status  detail  is  compared  to the  total  quantity  on  the  due-in  detail.   The  system  will  automatically  delete  any  excess status  detail  quantities  created due to status processing.   The ILS-S deletes  the excess status quantities  in order, starting with  exception  status  and continuing  through  shipped  status  until  the total  quantity on  the  status  details  equals  the  quantity  on  the  due-in  detail.    Note:   The  due- in detail  for  the  input  status  requisition  number  will  not  be  adjusted  during  this process. 5.2.87.7.4.2.  Partial  Status  Without  Suffix  Code.    Partial  status  received  for requisitions  without  a suffix  code should  only  be received  when  a base initiates  a cancellation  request  (AC*) transaction.   Note:   The  following  types  of  status  and status  codes apply: 5.2.87.7.4.2.1.  Status  codes B8 and B9 (action  has been denied  or is  pending). 5.2.87.7.4.2.2.  Shipment shipment/date). status showing shipment data (mode of 5.2.87.7.4.2.3.  Other positive  status  indicating  the due-in  cannot  be canceled. 5.2.87.7.4.3.  Total  Status  Transactions.    If  the  input  quantity  on  the  AE*  status transaction  equals the  ILS-S  creates  a corresponding  status  detail. the  quantity  on  the  due-in  detail, 5.2.87.7.5.  Transaction  History  Records.    For  any  status  code  received  that  directly affects  the  due-in  detail,  the retail  system  will  record a transaction  history  event  for  the status.   The  ILS-S automatically  writes  and stores a transaction  history  record when  the due-in  detail  quantity,  signal  code, or  other  indicative  data are  changed  during  status processing. 5.2.87.7.6.  Interchangeable  and  Substitute  Linkage.    The  ILS-S  automatically  links interchangeable  and  substitute  items  together  when  status  is  received  on  any  stock number  in  an interchangeable  and  substitute  group.   The  Primary  Supply  Point  (PSP) will  not  ship  substitute to  master  and interchangeable  items  in  the  D043  interchangeable  and  substitute  group  (ISG).  The FSL  will  not  assign  ISG  relations  different  from  those  reflected  in  D043.  Local  ISG relationships  are  not  authorized  at en  route  locations.    Note:   If  the  units  of  issue  are different  for linked  stock numbers,  the system  will  link  the two stock numbers  together as substitutes. items  to  FSLs.    FSL  stocks  are  limited 5.2.87.7.7.  Estimated  Shipping  Date  (ESD).   Positions  70-73 of  the  AE*  status  input contain  the  ESD  from  the  source  of  supply.   If  the  ESD  is  not  provided  on  the  AE* transaction,  the  ILS-S computes  the  ESD  based upon  UMMIPS  standards  and  places the computed  date in  the ESD position  of the status  detail.   See Para  5.2.4.16 for more information  concerning  UMMIPS standards. 528 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.2.87.7.8.  ILS-S Record Update.  When  status  (AE*)  transactions  to create or change status  details  process in  the ILS-S, other internal  system  records are updated as follows : 5.2.87.7.8.1.  Materiel  Acquisition  Control  Record  (MACR).    If  the  quantity requisitioned  is reduced,  or the  price  changes,  the  ILS-S will  update  the MACR. 5.2.87.7.8.2.  Routing  Identifier  Record.   The  ILS-S  will  update  individual  status codes on the  routing  identifier  record for  each source  of supply.   See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for  details. 5.2.87.7.8.3.  Item  Record.   If  the  ILS-S receives  a status  (AE*)  transaction  for  a stock number  that  is  not  loaded,  the  system  will  format  an  item  record load  (FIL) transaction  without  the  unit  price,  unit  of  issue,  and routing  identifier  code.  These elements  are derived  from  the AE* status  transaction. 5.2.87.7.8.4.  Item  Record Merges.   Upon status  (AE*)  transaction  processing,  the ILS-S  will  merge  item  records  if:    a  stock  number  (NSN)  replaces  a  P  (part-number),  NC (non-cataloged),  or ND (non-stocklisted)  item;  an  ND item  replaces a P number;  or an NC item  replaces  an ND item.   See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for  more  information  concerning  item  record merges. 5.2.87.7.8.5.  Status  management  notices.   The  Stock Control   function  number  or enhanced  print  database will  receive  output  management  notices  for Priority  Group one  (1)  requisitions.   Priority  Groups  2 and  3 output  management  notices  will  be sent  to  Computer  Operations  or  the  enhanced  print  database.    Other  output management  notices  will  be directed  to the  appropriate  function  number. 5.2.87.7.8.6.  Receipt  Transaction  (REC)  Images.    Receipt  transaction  (REC)  or “trigger”  images  are created and stored in  the ILS-S when  status (AE*)  transactions process.    This  allows  for  automated  receipt  processing  when  items  due-in  are received  by  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity.   REC  images  are also  produced for  partial  due-in  quantities  (differentiated  by  Suffix  Code)  when  positive  or shipment  status  is  received.   Note:   If  a due-in  quantity  or stock  number  change occurs,  a replacement  receipt  transaction  image  will  be produced. 5.2.87.7.9.  Special  Status  (BN)  Processing.   BN  (Free  Issue)  status  is  received  from the source of supply  through  AE* status  transactions  when  some or all  of the requisit io n quantity  will  be provided  free  of cost.  Normally,  when  BN status  is received,  the  ILS-S changes  the  signal  code to  “D”  and  advice  code to “2E”  on affected  due-in  details.   Additionally,  if  BN status  is  provided  for  a portion  (partial)  or the  due-in  quantity,  the ILS-S creates additional  status  details  (each suffix  code) for managing  the  free amount of the total  requisition  quantity.   Lastly,  if  the  item  record contains  Budget  Code Z, the Undelivered  Orders Outstanding  (UOO) field  of  the budget  code Z MACR is  updated.  5.2.87.7.9.1.  BN Status for Contractor  ICP Requirements.   When AE* transactions contain  BN  status  for  Contractor  ICPs  (RIC  equals  F(n)(n))  process,  the  ILS-S changes  the  signal  code to D and advice  code to 2E on the  due-in  detail.   When  BN status  is  processed  for  partial  quantities, the  ILS-S  decreases  the  requisit io n quantity  accordingly,  and  establishes  partial  status  details  with  signal  code D and advice  code  2E  for  the  portion  identified  as  free  issue.   If  the  RIC  on  the  status (AE*)  transaction  is  different  than  the  RIC on the  due-in  detail,  the ILS-S changes AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 529 the  RIC on the  due-in  detail  to match  the RIC on the  AE* transaction. 5.2.87.7.9.2.  BN Status for Lateral  Support Requirements.   When AE* transactions contain  BN status  for  Lateral  Support  (RIC  equals  JLS/D(**))  process,  the  ILS-S changes  the  signal  code to D and advice  code to 2E on the  due-in  detail.   When  BN status  is  processed  for  partial  quantities, the  ILS-S  decreases  the  requisit io n quantity  accordingly,  and  establishes  partial  status  details  with  signal  code D and advice  code 2E for the  portion  identified  as free  issue. 5.2.87.7.9.3.  BN  Status  for  Other  Routing Identifier  Codes.    When  AE* transactions  contain  BN status  for  RICs other  than  F(n)(n),  JLS, or D**, the  ILS-S will  produce  a 379 Reject.   This  reject  indicates  contact  with  the  source  of  supply is  required.   See  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7  for more  information. 5.2.87.7.9.4.  BJ/FS  (Adjusted  to Quantity  Unit  Pack) Status.   A ILS-S requisit io n quantity  adjustment  (increase  or decrease) by  the source  of  supply  (to the  quantity unit  pack (QUP) will  cause the  wholesale  supply  system  to generate  an AE*  status transaction  containing  BJ or FS status.   BJ or FS status  identifies  the  amount  of the requisition  quantity  the  supply  source  will  ship  in  positions  25-29.  Therefore,  the ILS-S due-in  detail  quantity  will  be changed  accordingly  to the amount  on the AE* status  transaction.   When  BJ or FS status  is received,  the  ILS-S will  adjust  the  due-in  quantity  to the AE* status  quantity,  update the MACR for decreased or increased amount,  and produce  a new receipt  (REC)  image  for  the adjusted  quantity. to  Requisition  Cancellation  Request  (AC1)  Transactio ns.   5.2.87.7.10.  Response When  the  requisitioned  (due-in)  quantity  is  excessive  or no longer  required,  the  ILS-S or Stock  Control  prepares  requests  for  cancellation  (RECCANX)  transactions  for  the source  of  supply.   See  Para  5.2.87.7.1  for  RECCANX  transaction  format  and processing  instructions.    After  request  processing,  the  retail  Materiel  Management Activity  produces  request  for  cancellation  (AC1) transactions.   The  wholesale  supply activity  accepts  AC1  transactions  and  provides  MILSTRIP  supply  status  (AE*)  or shipment  status  (AU*)  transactions  in  response.   See  Para  5.2.87.7.2  for  format  and processing  instructions  for AC1 transactions.   If the items  have been shipped,  the source of  supply  provides  shipment  status  in  the  form  of  AU1 transactions.   See  Para  5.2.90 for format  and processing  instructions  for AU1 transactions.   The most common  supply status  received  for  cancellation  request  (AC1)  transactions  is  “BQ”  status.   See Para 5.2.88  for  more  information  concerning  BQ  status.    The  ILS-S  processes  AE* transactions  received  for cancellation  request  transactions  as follows: 5.2.87.7.10.1.  B9  (Pending)  Status.    B9  status  response  indicates  the  requisit io n quantity  will  either  be canceled  or shipped  to another  activity.   Later  status  will  be provided.   If  the  status  code is  B9, the  ILS-S stores  B9  in  the  current  status  field and  shifts  ZC/ZD  (request  for  cancellation)  status  to  the  previous  status  field  on status  details. 5.2.87.7.10.2.  Other  Than  B9  Status.    If  supply  status  received  is  other  than cancellation  status,  and  more  current  than  the  present  status,  the  ILS-S will  store the AE* transaction  status  provided  in  the previous  status  field  on status  details.   In this  situation,  ZC/ZD  (request  for  cancellation)  status  will  remain  as  the  current status. 530 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.2.87.7.10.3.  B8 (Cannot  be Canceled)  or AU1 Status  Reply.   If  the response  to a request  for  cancellation  is  an  AU1  (a reply  to  cancellation  with  shipment  status), the  ILS-S will  shift  ZC/ZD  (request  for  cancellation)  status  to the  previous  status field  and  place  the  mode  of  shipment  in  the  current  status  field  on  status  details.   For B8 (cannot  be canceled)  status  received,  the ILS-S updates the status  detail  with B8 status  and  flags  the  due-in  detail  with  an  “S”  in  the  suppress  cancellation  flag field.    This  action  suppresses  further  cancellation  request  transactions  for  the requisition. (A0*) transactions for  Routing 5.2.87.7.11.  FQ  (DLATS  Fund/Signal  Code  Change  )  Status.    DLATS  edits  ILS-S requisition Identifier,  Signal,  and  Fund  code compatibility.   If  any  combinations  of  these  codes are incompatible  on  the  requisit io n transaction,  DLATS  assigns the  correct  combination  of  the  above  codes  to  the requisition  and  routes  corrected  requisitions  to  the  supply  source.    When  DLATS changes  ILS-S  requisitions  in  this  manner,  they  notify  requisitioning  bases  through AE9  status  transactions  containing  “FQ”  status.    When  AE9  transactions  containing FQ  status  are  processed  in  the  ILS-S,  due-in  details  are  automatically  modified  to identify  new Fund,  Signal,  and/or Routing  Identifier  codes.  After  processing,  the ILS-S  writes  a  transaction  history  to  record  the  change.    See  Para  5.2.88  for  more information  concerning  FQ status  processing. (A0B)/A02).   Part-numbered 5.2.87.7.12.  Part-Numbered  Requisitions items  are normally  requisitioned  in  the  ILS-S using  A0B  or A02 transactions.   See  Para  5.2.37 for  A0B/A02  transaction format,  and  Para  5.2.36.2  for  complete  part-number requisitioning  procedures.    DLATS  sends  ILS-S  part-numbered  (non-NSN)  item A0B/A02  requisition  transactions  to  the  Defense  Integrated  Data  System  (DIDS)  to determine  if  the  part  number  requested  can  be  converted  to  a national  stock  number (NSN).  Based  on  Defense  Integrated  Data  System  (DIDS)  processing,  the  following actions  will  occur: 5.2.87.7.12.1.  Part  Number  Converted.    When  A0B/A02  part-number  items  are converted  to  valid  stock  numbers  by  DIDS,  DLATS  will  change  the  requisit io n transaction  identifier  (DIC) to A0A/A01 (based on location)  and route the corrected requisition transactions  are changed  in  this  manner,  DLATS  sends  the  requisitioning  base  AE9  transactions containing  “BG”  status.      See Para  5.2.88 for  more  information  concerning  BG status.    Processing  the  AE9  transaction  in  the  ILS-S  will  produce  the  following results:   When  ILS-S  requisition to  the  source  of  supply. 5.2.87.7.12.1.1.  Item  record  load  (FIL)  processing.    If  the  AE9  transaction NSN is  not  loaded,  an  item  record  load  (FIL)  transaction  for  the  new  NSN is processed.  See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for more information  concerning FIL transaction  processing. 5.2.87.7.12.1.2.  Item  record merge  (FIC) processing.   During  AE9 transaction processing,  the  ILS-S  will  merge  part-numbered  and  stock  number  records  if possible.   When the merge  data on the part number  is incompatible  with  change-to stock number  records, a 137 Reject  will  occur.   See AFH  23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7  for more  information  concerning  137 Rejects.   Research  personnel  will AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 531 prepare  an  indicative  date  change  (FIC)  transaction numbered  record  to  be  compatible  with  the  change-to  stock  number  record.  After  correcting  indicative  data on the part number  record, the  AE9 transaction with  BG status  is  reprocessed  in  the  ILS-S to merge  the records.

BV  (Direct  Delivery  from  Contractor)  Status.   When  requisitioned  items are provided  directly  from  contractors  or vendors,  BV  status  is  provided.   The  ILS-S processes status  (AE*)  transactions  containing  BV status  as follows: 5.2.87.7.14.1.  RIC  Equals  JBB.   If  the  item  is  procured  locally  (item  record  RIC equals  JBB),  the  ILS-S  creates  new  status  details  or  updates  current  status  on existing  status  details.   The status  transaction  also provides  the unit  price of the item in  positions  74-80.  Normally,  for  local  purchase  items,  the  item  record  unit  price reflects  the  last  purchase  price  for  the  item,  and  may  not  be  the  unit  price  of  the item  supplied.   If  the  unit  price  reflected  on the  status  transaction  is  different  than the  item  record  unit  price,  the  ILS-S will  update  the  unit  price  to  match  the  price received  on the status transaction.   If the unit  price reflected  on the status transaction equals  the  item  record  unit  price,  no  update  action  is  taken.   See  Para  5.2.88 for more  information  concerning  BV status  processing. 5.2.87.7.14.2.  RIC Not Equal  to JBB.  If the RIC does not equal  JBB, the unit  price on the  item  record will  not be updated. 5.2.88.  MILSTRIP,  Intra-Air  Force,  And  Intra-Base  Requisition  Status  Codes  and Phrases. 5.2.88.1.

Processing:   If the  requisition  is still  required,  check previous  MILSTRIP supply  status.   If  the supply  source  has not  provided  positive  supply  or shipment  status,  send  a follow-up  (AF*) transaction  to the source  of supply.   See F421 MGT  notice  (Requisition  Modifier  (AMx)  in  Error  – Status  Code B2) in  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7  for  additional  information. Canceled.   The supply  source  has received  a cancellation  request  from  the requisitioner,  consignee,  manager,  or other  authorized  activity.   Processing:   Do not de-obligate  funds.   Billing  for  materiel  on contract  termination changes  will  be made. The  source  of supply  identified  by positions  4-6 of  the requisition  received your  follow-up  request. Processing:   The  source of  supply  will  try  to determine  the current  status  of the  requisition  and/or  improve  the  estimated  shipment  date (ESD).  Status will  be furnished  again  within  7 calendar  days. Note:   B5 status  is  used  only  when  previous  status  codes were BA, BB, BD, or BV. B6 The  requisition  was canceled  and the  materiel  was shipped  to another B7 B8 B9 BA BB activity. Unit  price  change.   Positions  74-80 contain  the  latest  unit  price  for  the item identified  by the  stock or part number  in  positions  8-22.   Quantity  requested  for  cancellation  cannot  be canceled. The  activity  identified  by the  code in  positions  4-6 received  your cancellation  request.   Processing:   The  activity  will  either  cancel  the  demand or ship  the  materiel  to another  customer.   Do not de-obligate  funds  or delete due-in.   Later  status  reports  will  tell  you  about  the final  action. The  item  is  being  processed for release  and shipment.   Once a requisitioned item  has  been released  off  the  shelf  for shipment,  the  wholesale  source  of supply  considers  the  requisition  completed,  closes  all  active  records, and places  it  in  the  history  file. Note:   According  to MILSTRIP  directives,  the source  of supply  must maintain  history  files  in  the  wholesale  supply  system  for  180 days.   The  item  has  been backordered against  a due-in  to stock at the  source of supply.   Positions  70-73 contain  the estimated  shipping  date  (ESD)  the materiel  will  be released  to the  customer.   (BB may  be used for  local manufacture  requisitions.)

However,  an item  which  is  not an AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 533 automatic  substitute  is  available.   The  price  for the  substitute  item  appears in positions  74-80. Processing:   Coordinate  with  the  customer  to determine  if  the substitute  item is  acceptable.   If  the customer  accepts the  substitute,  submit  a requisit ion cancellation  request  (AC1) transaction  for the  original  requisition  and submit a new  requisition,  using  a new  document  number  with  the  current  Julian date.  See F437 MGT notice  (Item  B/O, Long  Delay  Anticipated)  in  AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7  for  additional  information. Action  on the requisition  is delayed  because  the supply  source  needs more information  on the item,  such  as authorized  application,  item  identification, technical  data, etc.  This  code is used  on priority  09-15 requisitions  when  the depot item  record is  frozen.   The  estimated  release  date, if  known,  will  be in positions  70-73 of  the status  response.   When  the review  is  complete, additional  status  information  will  appear. BD status  may  also  be used  to indicate  a local  manufacture  item  cannot  be manufactured  because  of a lack  of part, drawing,  etc. The  depot/storage  activity  has a record of  the materiel  release  order (MRO), but it  has  no supporting  transaction/record  of action  taken.   BE status  occurs because  the depot or storage  activity  is  responding  to an ICP request  about the  MRO status.   Applies  to AE6 status  transactions  only. No record of  your  document  for  which  your  requisition  follow-up  (AF*) or cancellation  request  (AC1) was submitted. a.  Follow-up  (AF*) Transaction  Processing.   If  BF status  was received  in response  to a follow-up  (AF*) transaction,  the  supply  source  will  continue  to process later  documents  it  receives  (A0*, AM*, AT*)  with  the  same document  number  under  regular  MILSTRIP  procedures. b.  Processing  for  a Cancellation  Request.   If this  status  code was received because  of a cancellation  request,  the supply  source  will  return  later requisitions  (A0*) or other  transactions  (AM*, AT*, etc.) it  receives  with  BF status.   De-obligate  funds  and, if  the customer  still  needs the  item,  submit  a new  requisition  using  a new  document  number. Note:   If  you  requisition  the  item  with  a new  document  number,  submit  a cancellation  request  (AC1) transaction  before  you  de-obligate  funds.    One or more  of the  following  fields  have  been changed: a.  Stock number  (as the  result  of  a formal  catalog  change). (1)  The  requisitioned  NSN has  been replaced  by or consolidated  with  NSN in  stock number  field. (2)  The  NSN is assigned  to the part number  that  was requisitioned.

The  Due-In  Cancellation  Request  (RECCANC) input  transaction  is used  to  request  cancellation  from  supply  sources  for  retail  materiel  manage me nt requisitions.  The  request  for  cancellation  transaction  may  be automatically  processed 552 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 by the ILS-S or manually  processed by LRS Customer  Service  or AFMC. If processed by the  ILS-S, the  current  status  field  is  changed  to “ZD”  on  status  details.  Note:  ILS-S requests  for  due-in  cancellation  are  generated  when  due- in  excess  is  computed  by File  Status  processing.  See Para  5.2.91.2 for  more  information  concerning  File  Status processing.  If  request  for  due-in  cancellation  is  manually  processed, the  current  status field  is  changed  to  “ZC”  on  status  details.  See  Para  5.2.87.7 for  general  processing instructions  for  requesting  due-in  cancellation  action.  The  ILS-S produces  request  for cancellation  (AC1) output  transactions  for each  due-in  cancellation  request  processed. 5.2.91.2.  File  Status  processing.   File  status  must  be processed against  all  item  records  at least  once  each quarter.   File  status  on item  records with  an alpha  budget  code or a budget code 8 must  be initiated  and completed  during  the  first  week of  each new  quarter.   This  is essential  because  file  status  writes  TTPC 4G transaction  history  records that the D28 report uses  to provide  updated usage  data to the Readiness  Based Leveling  system  at AFMC.  (If the  MAJCOM  determines  that  file  status  will  be  processed  more  frequently,  Compute r Operations  must  run  program  S01/NGV815  see  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  3,  Ch  16;  this program  blanks  the item  record file  status  quarter  code.)  Stock Control  must  determine  the type  of  excess  to  be  processed.    Stock  Control  must  also,  together  with  the  Comput er Operations,  carefully  schedule  the  quarterly  file  status  processing  so that  the  output  does not create  an excessive  workload  for other  flights  within  the  ILS-S. 5.2.91.3.

Military  Standard  Transportation  and  Movement  Procedures  (MILSTAMP).   MILSTAMP  tracer  reconciliation  program  (NGV597)  is  used  to  identify  shipments  that have  been delayed  or misplaced  between  the  shipping  and receiving  activities.   The  LRS, Transportation  and  the  Supply  activities  must  work  together  to  research  and  trace delinquent  requisitions  (shipments)  identified  by  the  MILSTAMP  Tracer  Reconcilia t io n (NGV597) program.   This  requirement  also  applies  to the Receiving  and Cargo Movement functions  performed  by  the  DLA  Distribution  at  the  ALCs.   Therefore,  any  reference  to Cargo  Movement  and  Receiving the  DLA  Distribut io n performing  the  Receiving  and  Cargo  Movement  functions  at  the  ALCs.    Note:    Cargo Movement  responsibilities  are defined  in  AFI 24-203. in  this  chapter  also  includes 5.2.95.1.1.  MILSTAMP  tracer  reconciliation  program  logic.   Various  output  listings and  transactions  are produced  to assist  with  the  identification,  tracing,  and  receipt  of delayed  or lost  requisitions  (shipments).

ES-S Late  Inbound  Shipment  Process.  The  ES-S “Manage Late Inbound Serviceable  Shipments”  process  automates  the  current  manual  SBSS  Tracer  Action Required  (TAR)  process.   ES-S programmatically  identifies  (up to two  weeks earlier) late  inbound  serviceable  shipments  based  upon  existing  delivery  time  standards  and manages  these  shipments  by  creating  and  updating  internal  records.    For  each  late inbound  serviceable  shipment identified,  ES-S  queries  the  Global  Transportatio n Network (GTN) for updated  shipment  status,  and when  applicable,  generates  shipment status  (AS1) transactions  for processing  and update  action  in  the  SBSS.  Additiona l ly, ES-S generates  reports  that  prompt  the user  (role-based)  to select  appropriate  action  to AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 557 resolve  late inbound  shipments  and automatically  produce  and transmit  all  transactions (TAR/AS1/AE1/SPR/1GP/REC/FFC)  required  to  update  ES-S late  inbound  shipment and  associated  SBSS  records.

Shipment  status  is provided  to the ILS-S using  shipment  status (AS*) transactions.   See Para  5.2.90 for  AS* transaction  format  and processing  instructions.   The  ILS-S  contains  shipment  status 5.2.95.2.2.  MILSTAMP  transit  time  expired.    Normal  MILSTAMP  transit  time  has expired  or undue  delay  has occurred.   Transit  times  for  various  shipments  expire  based upon  a combination  of the requisition  priority  and required  delivery  date (RDD).   Once shipment  transit  time  has  expired,  tracer  action  is  automatically  initiated  through  the next  processing  of the  MILSTAMP  Tracer Reconciliation  program  as follows: 5.2.95.2.2.1.  Mission  capable  (MICAP)  required  delivery  date  (RDD).    Mission Capable  (MICAP)  requirements  are  identified  by  priority  01-08  requisit io ns assigned  an RDD  of 999, N**, or E**.  Tracer  action  is initiated  between  7 and 14 days for  CONUS, and between  14 and 21 days for  OCONUS MICAP shipments. 5.2.95.2.2.2.  Non-MICAP  RDD.    Non-MICAP  requirements  are  identified  by priority  01-08 requisitions  assigned  an RDD of 555/777, or priority  1-15 requisit io n with  an  assigned  RDD  of  444.  Tracer  action  is  initiated  between  20 and  30 days for  CONUS, and between  30 and  40 days for  OCONUS non-MICAP shipments. 5.2.95.2.2.3.  Blank  RDD.    Shipments  containing  a  blank  RDD  indicate  routine transportation  is  applicable.   Tracer  action  is  initiated  between  30 and 60 days  for CONUS, and between  60 and 90 days for  OCONUS shipments. 5.2.95.3.  Transportation  Tracer  Flag  (TTF)  Assignment.   The  TTF  is  assigned  to  ILS-S shipment  status  details  when  shipment  status  is  provided  by  the  LRS/transportat io n activity. tracer  flags  are  automatically  assigned  and  used  to  identify overdue  or lost  shipments.   Overdue  or lost  shipments  are based on MILSTAMP  standards using  the  priority  designator  and  RDD.   Additionally,  TTF  assignment  is  based upon  the mode of shipment  or transportation  method  used.  Requisitions  (shipments)  are traced when government  transportation  or  mail  channels  are  used.    Note:    If  requisition  (shipme nt) tracing tracer  flag  determines  which  portion  of  the MILSTAMP  Tracer Reconciliation  Listing  the  overdue  or lost  shipment  appears on. the  transportation   Transportation is  required, 5.2.95.4.

Transportation  tracer  listing  (TTF  Equals  T).    The  Transportation  Tracer Listing  identifies  delayed  or lost  requisitions  (shipments)  that  were  shipped  through government   See  AFMAN  23-122,  Sec  5B,  Order  and Requisitioning  for  more  information  and  processing  procedures  for  the  transportatio n tracer listing. transportation  channels. 5.2.95.4.2.  Parcel  post tracer  listing  (TTF  Equals  P).   The  Parcel  Post Tracer  Listing identifies  delayed  or  lost  requisitions  (shipments)  that  were  shipped  by  various  mail methods.   For example,  overdue  shipments  using  Parcel  Post,  Military  Ordinary  Mail (MOM),  and  Express  mail  methods  are  contained  on  this  portion  of  the  list.    See AFMAN  23-122,  Sec  5B,  Order  and  Requisitioning for  more  information  and processing  procedures  for  the  Parcel  Post  Tracer  Listing.    Initial  parcel  post  tracing efforts  are  provided  in  the  form  of  Request  for  Registered,  Insured,  and  Certified Shipment  Tracing  (AFT)  transactions.   The  AFT transaction  provides  the date shipped, shipment  control  number,  and mode of shipment  designators.   See Para 5.2.96 for more information  concerning  AFT transaction  format  and processing  instructions. 5.2.95.4.3.  Receipt  acknowledged  error  listing (TTF  equals  A).    The  Receipt Acknowledged  Error  Listing  identifies  delayed  or  lost  requisitions  (shipments)  that were  previously  identified  as received  by  Cargo Movement;  however,  not  received  in the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity.    See  AFMAN  23-122, Sec  5B,  Order  and Requisitioning for  more  information  and  processing  procedures  for  the  receipt acknowledged  error  listing. 5.2.95.4.4.  Consolidated  shipment  error  listing  (TTF  Equals  L).    The  Consolidated Shipment  Error  Listing  identifies  delayed  or  lost  requisitions  (shipments)  that  were shipped  as part of  a consolidated  shipment.   Consolidated  shipments  are identified  by a lead  transportation  control  number  (TCN).   The  TCN serves  as  a shipment  control number  from  shipment  release  to  shipment  receipt.    See  AFMAN  23-122, Sec  5B, Order  and  Requisitioning  for  more  information  and  processing  procedures  for  the Consolidated  Shipment  Error  Listing.    Additionally,  the  consolidated  shipment  error listing  produces  Consolidated  Shipment that  allow verification  of items  contained  in  consolidated  shipments.

Exception  action  listing  (TTF  Equals  F).    The  Exception  Action  Listing identifies  delayed  or  lost  requisitions  (shipments)  that  were  identified  as  previously being  traced  by Cargo  Movement  on previous  listings.   See for  more  information  and processing  procedures  for  the  Exception  Action  Listing.   Additionally,  overseas  bases are  provided  the  Exception  Action  Listing  to  identify  delayed  or  lost  requisit io ns (shipments)  through  the use of transportation  follow-up  (TM1) transactions.   See Para 5.2.98  for  format  and  processing  procedures  for  overseas  transportation  follow- up (TM1)  transactions.   Overseas  follow-up  (TM1)  transactions  will  be replied  to  with tracer  action  reply  (TMA)  transactions.    TMA  transactions  provide  overseas  bases replies  to  shipment  follow-up  transactions,  and  provide  date  shipped,  day  received, mode  of  shipment,  etc.   See  Para  5.2.99  for  format  and  processing  instructions  for overseas  tracer  action  reply  (TMA)  transactions. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 559 required (TAR)   Processing transaction  processing. 5.2.95.5.  Tracer  action the MILSTAMP  Tracer  Reconciliation  program  will  produce  listings  and  TAR  inputs  based upon  the  transportation tracer  flag  (TTF)  in  the  shipment  status  detail.    The  TAR transactions  are used for  a variety  of purposes.   First,  TAR  transactions  are used to init iate tracer action,  and update  transportation  tracer flags  on shipment  status  details.   After  init ia l identification  and set up of  TTFs, TAR  transactions  are used  to delete  erroneous  shipme nt status  details,  or provide  internal  controls  to allow  for  subsequent  receipt  processing.   See Para  5.2.100 for  format  and  processing  instructions  for  TAR  transactions.   Note:   At  the option  of the LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  management  personnel,  may  prepare all supporting  documentation (CTH,  receipts,  management  notices),  process  all  TAR transactions,  and freeze  item  records with  special  inventory  notification  (1GP) transactions prior to sending  all  TAR  documentation  to the Inventory  section  for adjustment  processing.  5.2.95.5.1.  Shipped-short  receipt.   Specific  TAR  transactions  are processed if  delayed or  lost  requisitions  (shipments)  are  never  received.    Processing  of  a  TAR  input transaction  will  create  a short-shipped  receipt  and  delete  the  due-in  detail.   However, the corresponding  shipment  status  detail  will  not be deleted.   Ultimately,  TAR shipped -short receipt  processing  changes  the shipment  status  detail  supplementary  address field to  TARREC.    This  TARREC  designation identifies  TAR  shipped-short  receipt processing,  but  allows receipts  without  a corresponding  due-in  detail. to  process  subsequent the  ILS-S 5.2.95.5.2.  Subsequent  receipt.   Most  delayed  or  lost  requisitions  (shipments)  items are  eventually  received.    However,  during  receipt  processing,  if  the  ILS-S  finds  a shipment  status  detail  supplementary  address field  containing  TARREC,  but  the  due-in  detail  is  not loaded, the ILS-S will  allow  receipt  processing  without  producing  a 356 Reject  (due-in  detail  not  loaded).    See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  7  for  more information  concerning  356  Rejects.    Subsequent  receipt  action  for  delayed  or  lost requisitions  will  cause  the  ILS-S  to automatically  delete  the  shipment  status  detail  if the  total  requisition  quantity  has  been received.   However,  if  only  a partial  requisit io n quantity  is  received,  the  shipment  status  detail  will  not  be  deleted  until  the  entire quantity  is  received  or considered  lost. 5.2.95.6.  Shipment  Loss  Analysis  (M16).   The  M16  report  lists  shipment  status  details updated during  TAR  processing  and provides  statistical  data by source of supply  and mode code.    Additionally,  ILS-S  shipment  status  details  assigned  TARREC  used  in  metric compilation  for  the  Shipment  Loss  Analysis  (M16)  report.    The  M16  report  segregates delayed  or  lost  requisitions  (shipments)  into  potential  losses,  actual  losses,  or  recovered shipments.   See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for  more  information  concerning  the  M16 report.  The  listing  is  divided  into  three  parts as follows: 5.2.95.6.1.  Part one potential  losses.   Part One of the  M16 report lists  shipment  status details  that  contain  TARREC,  and a TAR  processing  date of 120 days or less  from  the current  date.  The shipments  appearing  on Part One have  not been physically  received, but have  the potential  for  receipt  within  the  next  four  months. 5.2.95.6.2.  Part  two  actual  losses.    Part  Two  of  the  M16 report  lists  shipment  status details  that  contain  TARREC,  and  a TAR  processing  date greater  than  120 days  from the  current  date.   The  shipments  appearing  on  Part  Two  have  not  been  received,  and 560 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 are considered  actual  losses  to the  ILS-S.  After  120 days,  shipment  status  details  are automatically  deleted. 5.2.95.6.3.  Part three recovered shipments.   Part Three  of the M16 report  lists  shipment status  details  that contain  TARREC,  but have  been physically  received  within  120 days of  TAR  transaction  processing.    The  shipments  appearing  on  Part  Three  have  been physically  received  and considered  recovered  shipments. 5.2.95.7.  Supply  Discrepancy  Report  (SDR)  process  (SF  364).    The  Report  of Discrepancy/Supply  Discrepancy  Report  (ROD/SDR),  SF  364,  is  filed  by  receiving activities  to record item  or packaging  discrepancies  attributable  to the shipping  activity  (see DLM  4000.25,  Vol  2,  Ch  17.    SDRs  are  prepared  for  nonreceipt  of  lost  or  misplaced requisitions  (shipments)  after  the  Traffic  Management  Office  confirms  non-receipt  of lost or misplaced  requisitions  (shipments).   Use the  ES-S SDR function  or the  DoD Web-SDR system  as the primary  means  to submit  SDRs and SF 364 when  the  ES-S SDR  function  or the  DoD Web-SDR system  is  not available.   The  SDR serves  two purposes: 5.2.95.7.1.  Notifies  shipping  organization.   The SDR notifies  the responsible  shipping activity,  such  as a contractor,  manufacturer,  or vendor  that,  a discrepancy  exists.   The SDR  aids  in  analyzing  and  correcting  discrepancies,  as  well  as  in  preventing recurrences. 5.2.95.7.2.  Aids  inventory  accounting.   The  SDR is used as a supporting  document  for inventory  accounting  and financial  adjustments.   A copy of the completed  report is used to  support  adjustments to  the  reporting  and  shipping  organizations'  accountable inventory  and financial  accounting  records. 5.2.96.  Registered,  Insured,  and  Certified  Parcel  Post  Shipment  Tracing Transaction. (AFT) 5.2.96.1.  Purpose.  To request  the source  of supply  trace delayed  or lost  shipments  sent by parcel  post  (mode  of  shipment  code G  or  H),  military  ordinary  mail  (mode  of  shipment code 6), or express  mail  (mode  of  shipment  code 7). 5.2.96.2.

TAR  Action  Codes.  Action  codes are assigned  as follows: a. Action  Code A. Action  Code A sets the  transportation  tracer  flag  (TTF)  on the shipment status  detail  to an  A.  When  program  NGV597 is  processed again,  shipment  status  details containing  TTF of A will  appear on  the Receipt  Acknowledged  Error  Listing.   These shipments  have  been received  by Cargo Movement,  but  not in  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity.  Additional  actions  are required  to determine  shipment  location.   OUTPUT:   None. b. Action  Code B.  Action  Code B indicates  Transportation  (Cargo  Movement  Tracing)  is tracing  the  lost  shipment.  Once requisitions  are being  traced  by Cargo Movement,  the  ILS-S will  move  an  M to the  transportation  tracer flag  on the  shipment  status  detail.   The  TAR program  will  change  the  M to an F when  the  next  TAR  program  is processed  30 days later.   This  will  cause  the shipment  status  detail  to appear on the  Exception  Action  List.  OUTPUT:   For overseas  bases tracing  shipments  through  transportation  channels,  a follow-up  (TM1) transaction  is  produced.  See Para 5.2.99 for  TM1 transaction  format  and processing instructions. c. Action  Code C.  Action  Code C prevents  a shipment  status  detail  from  appearing  on the Report  of Discrepancy  (NGV587) program.   TAR  transactions  with  action  code C are used to update  claims  receivable  (CR) and billed-not-received  (BNR)  details  to indicate  a supply deficiency  report (SDR)  was prepared and submitted.   The  TAR  transaction  containing  action code C must  be processed using  screen  #198. Note:   To process TAR  C transactions  correctly, you  must  first  process a TAR  with  an asterisk  (*).  The  asterisk  only  applies  to shortages.   Otherwise,  a 112 Reject  will  be produced.  For claims  payable  (CP) details,  a P will  be assigned  in  position  60. See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more  information  concerning 112 Rejects.  OUTPUT:  None. d. Action  Code D.  Action  Code D deletes  erroneous  shipment  status  details.  The  AFMC and LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel  will  use  TAR  “D”  processing  to correct erroneous  ship  details  when  required.   For example;  status  that  has been  processed after  partial receipt  of materiel.  OUTPUT:  None. e. Action  Code F.  Action  Code F is used  to manually  update SDR  follow-up  processing. OUTPUT:  None. f. Action  Code R.  Action  Code R is  used to manually  update  SDR reply  processing. OUTPUT:  None g. Action  Code T. Action  Code T produces  a request  for  shipment  tracing  for  controlled  parcel post shipments  marked  NO RECORD  on the Parcel  Post Tracer  List.   OUTPUT:   Request  for Registered,  Insured,  and  Certified  Parcel  Post shipment  tracing  (AFT)  transaction.   See Para 5.2.97 for  format  and processing  instructions  for the  AFT transaction. h. Action  Code Asterisk  (*).  Action  Code asterisk  (*) deletes  due-in  details  and  changes  the supplementary  address field  of the shipment  status  detail  to TARREC.  Note: If  the shipment status  detail  (211) DT-AV-SHPT  equals  REC, the  shipment  status  detail  cannot  be deleted.   Reject  notice  001 applies.   OUTPUT:   Creates a short-shipped  receipt  and produces  an I306 management  notice.

Due-Out  Status  Notification  (1SH) Conditions.   The  ILS-S creates  a due-out  status  notification to  repair  aircraft (commodity  code  K)  and  Comprehensive  Engine  Management  System  (CEMS) TCTO/time-change  items  when  tracking  procedures  are implemented,  according  to the supported  organization.    Creation  of  the  1SH  transaction  is  produced  as  a  result  of customer  backorder  (due-out)  establishment,  due-out  release,  due-out  cancellat io n, significant  status  changes  (Table 5.112.), or the backorder mark-for  field  (SRD and/or equipment  serial  number)  is  changed. for  spares  required 5.2.101.1.2.  Items  Excluded  from  Automated  Tracking.   Technical  order complia nce (TOC)  kits  and  ILS-S  due-out  detail  records  containing  activity  code B, E,  S, U, and W are excluded  from  automated  tracking  procedures. 5.2.101.1.3.  Partial  Due-Out  Release.    When  the  computer  makes  a  partial  due-out release  for  items  tracked  by  Maintenance,  the  due-out  release  program  creates  a 1SH output  that  contains  the  quantity  issued. 5.2.101.1.4.  Due-Out  Cancellations.  At the  end  of  the  day,  the  ILS-S creates  due-out cancellation  (DOC) transactions  as required.  See Para.  5.2.104 for  maintenance  due-out  cancellation  (DOC)  transaction  format  and  processing  instructions.  Additiona l ly, AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 567 the ILS-S produces due-out  cancellation  transactions  during  the periodic  reconcilia t io n between  IMDS CDB and the  ILS-S. 5.2.101.1.5.  Maintenance  Organization  Due-Outs.  The  ILS-S  currently  supports three  maintenance  programs:  IMDS  CDB (G105);  G081  (MAF  Log  C2);  and  the REMIS  (G099)  Reporting  System.  Each  due-out  supporting  these  systems  will  be identified  by  a due-out  maintenance  code on  the  ILS-S due-out  detail  record.  For example,  due-out  maintenance  code  M IMDS  CDB.  Due-out maintenance  code G identifies  G081. Lastly,  due-out maintenance  code N identifies non-  maintenance  organizations.  Note: Any  other  data in  the  due-out  IMDS CDB flag  field  on the  due-out  detail  record is  invalid. identifies 5.2.102.  Due-Out  Status Notification  (1SH) Transaction  Format. 5.2.102.1.

Customer  Backorder  Due-Out Cancellation  (DOC)  Transaction. 5.2.103.1.  Purpose.    To  explain  processing  procedures  and  transaction  format  for  the customer  backorder due-out  cancellation  (DOC) transaction. 5.2.103.2.  General.  The  using  organization  may request  backorder  (due-out) cancellation  action.  Supply  may  begin  the  due-out  cancellation  process  if  an  item AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 569 cannot  be supplied.  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel  should  coordinate with  AFMC to determine  if  the backorder can  be satisfied  prior  to processing  DOC. If cancelled,  use  the appropriate  status/cancellation  codes described  in  Para  5.2.7 Notify the  customer  that  cancellation  of  the  backorder  has  occurred.  Note: Stock  Control personnel  advise  the  EAE  of all  backorder cancellation  requests  for  equipment  items. 5.2.103.3.  Repair  Cycle  Item  Backorder  Cancellation.   When  a  backorder  contains  a corresponding  due-in-from- maintenance  (DIFM)  detail  record  (other  than  credit  DIFM), special  procedures  must  be used  to ensure  repair  cycle  information  is  properly  updated  in the ILS-S.  When the  serviceable  item  has not been issued  and a memo  DIFM detail  record exists,  the net-repair  cycle  days field  must  be updated (positions  62-64) when  the backorder is  cancelled. 5.2.103.3.1.  Automatic  Net  Repair  Cycle  Days  Calculation.   When  a  backorder contains  a corresponding  DIFM detail  and the  current  quarter  repair  cycle  time  equals the  new  quarter  repair  cycle  time,  the  DOC  transaction  is  processed  with  blanks  in positions  62-64.  The  repair  cycle  days will  be computed  by the ILS-S. 5.2.103.3.2.  Manual  Repair  Cycle  Days  Computation.   If  the  repair  cycle  record quarterly  repair  cycle  times  are blank,  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel enter  the  net  repair  cycle  days  in  positions  62-64 of  the  DOC input  transaction.   The net  repair  cycle  days are calculated  by  multiplying  the  quantity  backordered  times  the number  of  repair  (DIFM)  days.    Note:     The  number  of  repair  days  divided  by  the quantity  backordered  cannot  be  less  than  1  or  greater  than  29.   The  ILS-S  does  not update  the  repair  cycle  record when  maintenance  action  taken  code equals  B, J, V, or X on the DOC transaction  input. 5.2.103.4.  Credit  DIFM  Detail  Exists.   Customer  backorders  that  contain  corresponding credit  DIFM detail  records identify  existing  holes  or shortages  in  end-items.   LRS/Materie l Management  Activity  personnel  enter  TEX  2 in  position  51 of  the  DOC input  transaction when  canceling  a customer  backorder that  contains  a corresponding  credit  DIFM detail.   If TEX 2 is not used, a 466 reject (Credit  DIFM Detail  Exists  – Verify  Due-Out Cancellat io n) will  be produced. 5.2.103.5.  AWP  End-Item  Shipped/Condemned.    If  a  decision  is  made  to  evacuate  or condemn  an  AWP end-item,  the  bit  and  piece  backorders  will  be cancelled  or transferred to another  AWP  end-item.   If  cancelled,  enter  action  taken  code (ATC)  B in  position  44 and TEX 9 in  position  51.  This  will  ensure  cumulative  recurring  demands  are not reduced.  See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 2B, Stockage  Procedure,  for more  information. 5.2.103.6.  MICAP Backorder  Cancellation.   If a MICAP customer  backorder is cancelled, a MICAP stop (B9M)  report transaction  will  be produced with  delete  code 9.  Para 5.2.26. for  MICAP  delete  and  advice  codes.    When  a  due-in  linked  to  a  MICAP  customer backorder  is  canceled,  a  MICAP  stop  transaction  is  produced  and  delete  code  zero  (0) assigned.    If  the  MICAP  requirement  must  be  requisitioned  again,  process  a  special requisition  (SPR)  transaction  using  a new  requisition  number.   See  Para  5.2.54 for  more information  concerning  SPR  transaction  processing.    Note:      Once  a  new  requisit io n number  has been assigned,  a new MICAP start  (B9M) transaction  will  be produced. 5.2.103.7.  Input  Restrictions.

Canceling  Customer  Backorders & Process For  Granting  Credit. 5.2.105.1.  Purpose.  To explain  the backorder cancellation  process in  the ILS-S and to list the  rules  used to determine  if  credit  is granted  to supply  customers. 5.2.105.2.  Factors  Used  for  Granting  Credit.    The  ILS-S  uses  a  variety  of  factors  to determine  if  credit  is granted  to the supply  customer.   Those  factors  include:   budget  code, obligated  due-out,  un-obligated  due-out,  current  fiscal  year  versus  prior  fiscal  year,  assets position,  and ERRCD. Table 5.115.  Rules Used to Return Credit  During  Backorder  Cancellation  Process. Budget Code Rules Used to Grant  Credit   Credit  Returned  to Customer? Notes Category 1.  If un-obligated  due-out exists,   Credit  is  granted  with  no charge    Un-obligated  means the  customer’s  funds 8 or 9  Category 2.  If obligated  memo due-outs  exists  in  the  current  fiscal year,  the customer  may completely/partially  cancel,    Credit  is  granted  at full  value   have  not  yet been expensed  for requested  item. Obligated  means  the customer’s  funds  for the  requested  items  in supply  have  been expensed. Category 3.  If obligated  memo due-outs  exists  in  the  prior  fiscal year,  the customer  may No credit  is  granted.   Note, although  no credit  is  granted,  the prior  year’s  base appropriation  is  completely/partially  cancel, credited. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 573 100 percent  credit  is granted Credit  is  granted  for the  quantity cancelled.   Note, checking  the asset position  means  if  the  item  is part of an Interchangeable  & Substitute  Group,  then  all  asset balances  are considered  as one item  balance. Credit  is  granted  for the  quantity cancelled Category 4.  If obligated  firm  due-outs  exists  in  the current  fiscal  year and the  ERRCD  equals  XF3 and UJC equals  ‘AR’  or ‘BR’ (customer  may  completely/partially cancel),   Category 5.  If the  backorder is not in  category  1 thru  4 (above),  then the  asset position  is  checked and compared  to the existing  due-in balances.   If  no due-in  exists, Category 6.  If backorder is  not in category  1 thru  5 (above),  then  the asset position  is checked  and compared  to the existing  due-in balances.   If  due-ins  exist  and the total  due-in  balance  is  equal  to or less  than  the firm  due-out  balance (not  including  the  due-out  qty to be cancelled),   Alpha N/A, because customer  funds  are not expensed.

(2)  A due-in from  maintenance (DIFM), due-in, war reserve material (WRM) spares, or supply point detail record. b.  Enter  Z in  position  72 if  the  warehouse  location  record is to be deleted,  even  though  details  are related  to the  item  record.  The item  record serviceable  balance  MUST  BE ZERO.   This  process is especially  valuable  for  those  activities  having  limited  storage locations  to assign. c.  Detail warehouse locations will be deleted by using delete code Z and the detail balance is zero.  (Unserviceable detail locations are deleted when the detail balance is zero.) d.  DO NOT enter the Warehouse Location in pos. 31-41 when deleting a warehouse location.  Entering a location causes D14 to count deletion as a location change. 5.3.3.  Conducting  the  Warehouse  Storage  Location  Validation/FCS  Review.  The  FCS review  process  takes  place  only  during  on-line  processing.   Screens  1WL/426  and  2WL/427 are used to display  unmatched  FCS images  one at a time. 5.3.3.1.  Process  Codes.    The  program  requests  a  review  process  code  with  each  FCS image/2WL  screen  so  the  operator  can  tell  program  NGV408 what  to  do with  each  FCS image.   Warehouse  personnel  can  tab to and change  data as needed. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 577 5.3.3.1.1.  Process  Code P.  When  process  code P is  entered,  the  program  passes  the FCS image  to program  NGV405 for  on-line  processing  and deletes  it  from  the  location validation  file.   Process code P must  be used  when  requesting  a bin  label  or deleting  a warehouse  location. 5.3.3.1.2.  Process Code D.  Process code D will  cause  the  program  to delete  the  FCS image  from  the  location-validation  file. 5.3.3.1.3.  No Process Code.  If  no review  process code is  entered,  the program  retains the  FCS image  in  the location  validation  file  for  further  research. 5.3.3.2.  Displays  Images.   The program  displays  each FCS image  in  the location  validat io n file  one  at a time  until  all  FCS images  in  the  file  have  been  reviewed.   Once the  program encounters  the  end-of-file  sentinel,  it  terminates  processing. 5.3.3.3.  Terminating  the Review  Process.  The  operator can terminate  the review  any  time by entering  END in  the 2WL screen's  Warehouse  Location  data field. 5.3.3.4.  Restarting  the Review  Program.   To review  FCS images  still  remaining  in  the file, restart the program  by reentering  the 1WL to have  FCS images  output  one at a time  in 2WL screen  format. 5.3.4.  Supply  Point  Detail Load/Change/Delete/Inquiry  (FSP).   The  Forward  Supply  Point 5.3.4.1.  Purpose. to load/change/delete  supply  point  detail  records  to account  for  items  authorized  to be  pre-positioned  for maintenance  support at either  on-base or off-base  locations.   Specific  entries will  result  in  automatic  processing  of  an  issue  request  for  the  required  quantity.

L is  used for  load.  FSP inputs  can be used  to load  either  authorized  or substitute  detail  records.  Authorized  details  are identified  by a numeric authorized  quantity  and substitutes  by a blank  authorized  quantity  field.   Substitute  details  are also  created by the  issue  and due-out  release  programs  if necessary  when  an interchangeable  item  identified  in  an interchangeable  and substitute  group  (ISG) is  transferred  to the supply  point. b. C is used  for changes.   Inputs  to change  the type  authorization  code can only  be made against  the authorized  detail  record.  Any  change  made  to the type  authorization  code on the  authorized  detail  will  also  be made to  all applicable  substitutes  by program  control.   Changes  to the supplementary application  data fields  will  be made  individually  against  the applicable substitute  or authorized  detail  record. c. D is used  for deletes.   Authorized  or substitute  detail  records can be deleted by FSP inputs.   In either  case, the  on-hand  quantity  must  be zero.  Authorized details  cannot  be deleted  if  any  substitute  or due-out  details  are loaded for  that document  number.   Substitute  details  will  also  be deleted  by the turn-in program  if  the  on-hand  quantity  is  zero  and the authorized  quantity  and authorization  directive  and  requirements  code and supplementary  application data fields  are all  blank.   No entries  are required  in  positions  50-79 for deletes. d. I is used to inquiry a SUPPLY-POINT-DETAIL-RECORD.  Only the stock number,  system designator, and FSP document  number  is required on the input. No internal edits are made on this field.  Any data entered  on load or change inputs will be stored on the detail record.  On change inputs, an asterisk (*) in the last position of this field will cause the field on the detail record to be blanked. 2 AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 579 3 4 5 6 Position 17 is ignored on load and delete inputs.  Position 17 must be blank on change in authorization  quantity inputs.  Enter a P in position 17 to change a substitute detail to a prime detail. All supply points are identified by organization code 005 and any appropriate alpha/numeric shop code.  The shop code is used to identify a specific supply point. The document  number  of the detail (positions 36-49) must have an S activity code, 005 organization code, alphanumeric shop code, four numeric zeros in the date portion,  and a four-digit numeric serial number  other than zeros.  If an authorized  detail is being loaded, the input document  number cannot be equal to any detail already loaded.  If a substitute detail is being loaded, an authorized  prime detail must be loaded with the same document number. Note:   Four numeric  zeros will be stored in the date portion  of the document  number  of the detail record regardless of what may be in the input. Ship to stock record account number  (SRAN) (positions 50-55).  If type authorization  code (position 69) equals D, a valid SRAN must be entered or a R147 REJ notice (SD/S Not Loaded In Base-Supply-MGMT-DC) will be output.   Using a SRAN in conjunction  with type authorization  code D will cause requisitions for supply point details to have the SRAN automatically perpetuated  into the supplementary  address field of the requisition.  This will result in the item being shipped directly to the requesting activity.  Leave blank when loading substitute details.  Inputs to change the direct ship SRAN must be processed against the authorized  detail record. Authorized  quantity  (positions  64-68): a. ON LOADS,  the authorized  quantity  must  contain  all  numeric  characters (may  be all  zeros)  if  an authorized  detail  is  being  loaded.   The  authorized quantity  field  must  be blank  in  all  positions  if  a substitute  detail  is being loaded. b. ON CHANGES,  leave  blank  if  no  change  is  to be made  on the  detail record.  If  the authorized  quantity  is  to be changed,  enter  the desired  quantity in  this  field.   If  any  assets are on hand  when  decreasing  a supply  point authorization  the  supply  point  monitor  will  prepare a turn-in  (with  action taken  code T) using  AF Form  2005.  The  property  and turn-in  document  will be delivered  to Flight  Service  Center  for  further  action  (see  AFMAN 23-122,  Sec 6B, Returns  for the  TIN format). Note:   When adding or changing a supply point detail record, the total authorized  quantity of all supply point and mission support kit detail records 580 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 will be combined  and compared to the requisition objective (RO) (see AFMAN  23-122, Sec 2B, Stockage Procedure).   If the combined  authorized quantity exceeds the RO, a 632 REJ notice (Input QTY Plus SUP PT and MSK Auth QTY Exceeds  the RO) will be produced.   Either the RO must be increased by adding a special level, or the supply point authorized  quantity must be decreased.   Type authorization  code (position 69):  Must contain a valid type authorization  code (see AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2) when loading an authorized detail.  Leave blank when loading substitute details.  Inputs to change the type authorization  code must be processed against the authorized detail record.  Changes made to the authorized  detail are also made on all applicable substitutes.  Leave blank on change inputs if no change is desired. Enter the supply point storage location (positions 72-79).  This location is established and maintained as locally determined  by each supply point.  Enter whatever location is meaningful to the user; that is, LAUNCH for launch kits or PROP for prop shop, etc.  There are no edits performed  on this field.  To blank the storage location, leave this field blank.  If the storage location is the only field being changed, ensure all fields with the exception of the transaction identifier code (TRIC), Stock Number,  Action Code, Document  Number,  and System Designator are blank or the input will not process. The storage location is printed on issue (ISU), DOR, and MSI outputs  to facilitate the location of assets within supply points. Issue flag (position 84):  Enter an I when an authorized  supply point detail is being loaded or changed and automatic processing by the issue program is required.   When a load is processed, the authorized quantity  will be formatted  into the issue action quantity.  When a change is processed, the issue action quantity will be the difference between the authorized  quantity MINUS on hand and due-outs.  An F215 MGT notice (Issue-DOR Program Was Not Called In For Processing) will be produced  if the issue program was not called. Used in  conjunction  with  the  issue  interface.

The  following  information  applies:  a. If  selection  of authorized  in-use  detail  records is  based upon  the organization  code, enter  all numbers  for  the organization  code.  There  must  be an organization  cost center  record loaded that  is  equal  to this  code.    b. If  selection  is not  based upon  the  organization  code, leave  this  field  blank.  2.  The  following  information  applies:   a. If  selection  is based upon  the shop  code, enter  the shop  code.  Also  enter  the  organization code in  positions  7-9, since  selection  is not  made by shop  code alone.     b. If  selection  is not  based upon  the  shop code, leave  this  field  blank.  3.  The  following  information  applies:  a. If  selecting  records for a specific  use  code, enter  A, B, C, or D.  Also  enter  the  allowance identification.   Note:  Do not  enter  the use  code unless  the  input  organization  and shop codes are blank.    b. If  a use code is  not needed  for selection,  leave  this  field  blank.  4. The  following  information  applies: a. If  the allowance  identification  is used  for selection,  enter  this  field.  Use allowance  ID as follows: (1) The  first  three  positions  must  be numbers  or blanks.   The  first  three  positions  can be blank only  if  the  use code is  D (WRM equipment).   Note: Do not use  commas  in  the first  three positions  or the  input  will  reject. (2) The  last  four  positions  can be numbers,  letters,  blanks,  or commas.   All  except  the commas are used as selection  factors.   If you  enter  a comma  in  one or more  of  these  positions,  the program  will  ignore  that  character  of the  allowance  ID as a selection  factor.   You  may  use four commas.   A comma  is  the only  special  character  that  can be entered  in  these  four  positions; otherwise,  the  input  will  reject. (3) Allowance  ID cannot  be used for  selection  unless  the change-from  organization  and shop codes are blank. (4) If selecting  on WRM report code, this  field  cannot  be blank. b. If  allowance  ID is  not  used for  selection,  leave  this  field  blank.  5. The  following  information  applies: a. If  selection  is by the  organization  code only,  enter  the change-to  organization  code.  This code must  be a number  and  equal  to an organization  code that  is  loaded. The  input  will  reject  if the  change-to  organization  code is  blank  or equal  to the change-from  organization  code. b. If  selection  is by both  organization  and shop codes, the change-to  organization  and shop codes must  be entered.   The  change-from  organization  or shop code must  be different  from  the change-to  code. The  change-to  organization  code must  be numeric  and the  applicable organization  cost center  record must  be loaded. 6. The  following  information  applies: a. If  selection  is by shop  code, enter  the change-to  shop  code.  The  change-  to code can be equal to the  change-from  code if  the change-to  and  change-  from  organization  codes are different.   Either  the  change-to  organization  code or the  change-to  shop code must  be different  from  the change-from  code. b. If  selection  is not  by shop code, leave  this  field  blank.  AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 627  7. The  following  information  applies: a. Use codes A, B, and C can  only  be changed  to A or B.  If the  change  from  use  code is  D, the change  to code must  be D. b. If  this  field  does not  apply,  leave  it  blank.  8. The  following  information  applies: a. If  the allowance  ID is  used for  selection,  enter  this  field.    (1) The  first  three  positions  can be any  combination  of numbers,  blanks,  or commas.  Note: Do not use  alpha  characters  in  the first  three  positions. (2) The  last  four  positions  can be any  combination  of letters,  numbers,  blanks,  or commas.   Any position  of the change-to  allowance  ID that  contains  a comma  will  cause the  character  in  that position  of the allowance  ID on the  selected  authorized- in-use  detail  record to be carried forward  to the  same  position  of the  allowance  ID on the output  FCI.  Any  input  position  that does not  contain  a comma  will  cause  that  position  from  the  input  to be carried  forward  into the  output  FCI.  Note:    Do not use any  special  characters  other  than  commas. b. If  the allowance  ID is  not used for  selection,  leave  this  field  blank.  9. The  following  information  applies: a. If  debit  and credit  transfer  (issue  and turn-in)  documents  are not  desired  when  the FCI cards are input,  enter  an  S in  this  field.  The  S will  be carried  forward  into  the  output  FCI. b. If  debit  and credit  transfer  documents  are desired,  leave  this  field  blank.  The  blank  will  be carried  forward  into  the  output  FCI. c. Note:    If this  field  is anything  other than  S or blank,  the input  will  be rejected.  10. The  following  information  applies: a. If  selection  is desired  by both the  organization  and shop codes, this  field  will  contain  a beginning  control  number.   (Position  78 must  be blank.) (1) Enter  a four-digit  number  greater  than  zero. This  number  will  be the next  available  control number  that  can be assigned  to an authorized- in- use  detail  record for  the  change-to  shop code.  The  last  four  positions  of the  change-to  document  number  in  the  output  FCIs will begin  with  this  number  and run  consecutively.   Exception:  If  an authorized  in-use  detail record is  already  loaded for  the  gaining  custodian  (same  stock number,  system  designator, use code, WRM-reporting  application  code, BASS (BEAR)  composition,  base of planned use, alternate  storage  location,  equipment  code, end item  identification  code, UTC, increment  code/number,  and allowance  ID), the losing  detail  will  be consolidated  with  the gaining  detail  record. The  output  FCI will  contain  the  document  number  of the  gaining  detail in  the  change-to  document  number  field. (2) All  FCIs will  be output  with  a complete  change-to  document  number  when  selection depends upon  the  shop code. b. If  the organization  and shop  codes are not used for  selection,  leave  blank. 11. The  following  information  applies: a. if  you  use the  organization  code without  the  shop code for  selection,  use M (merge)  or R (retain)  in  this  field.  If  position  78 contains  anything  other  than  M or R of  if  position  78 is blank,  the input  will  be rejected. (1) Enter  M, and leave  positions  74-77 blank,  if  you  believe  that  the  change-to  organization  code has existing  authorized-in- use  detail  records and the change-  from  organization  code will merge  with  that  organization.  If  the  computer  finds  an authorized  –in-use  detail  to be merged n be merged  with.  628  AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013       with  the  losing  detail,  the FCI will  be output  with  the complete  document  number  of the gaining  detail  that  the losing  detail  can be merged  with.  If no gaining  detail  is  found  that  can be merged  with  the losing  detail,  the gaining  detail  serial  number  portion  will  be blank  on the output  FCI image.    (2) Enter  an R if  it  is desired  to retain  the losing  detail  serial  number.  If  no details  are found  for merging,  the  losing  detail  serial  number  will  be entered  into  the  gaining  document  number  of the  output  FCI.       b. If  the organization  code is  not  used for  selection,  leave  this  field  blank.  12. System  designator  is  a mandatory  entry.  13. If  you  want  the FCI images  to be loaded  to the  pseudo for  processing,  enter  a P.  Leaving  this position  blank  will  create a file  with  the  file  name  of GV555UD900.   The  qualifier  will  be the same  as the  qualifier  for  the print  file.  This  file  may  be reviewed  and/or  edited  prior  to loading to pseudo  for processing.  If  this  position  equals  a P and the  program  is  being  processed  on the secondary  gang,  ensure  the primary  gang  is  up. 14. Process change  to prime  detail  only.  This  field  is  based on the  change-  to use code. For change-to  use code A, the  field  must  be numeric  (mobility  increment  number).   For change  to use code B or D, the  field  can be alpha/numeric. 5.4.22.  EM File Maintenance:   1RB555 Output.  5.4.22.1.  Purpose.

If  this  field  is  blank,  the  FET will  process normally. c.  If  this  field  is  invalid,  an S will  be assigned  automatically. 3.  The  following  information  applies: a.  If  the item  is a vehicle,  enter  its  vehicle  registration  number.   Refer  to AFI 24-302.  AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 631 b.  If  the item  is not  a vehicle,  leave  this  field  blank. 4.  If  this  field  is  blank,  issue  priority  12 will  be assigned  to output  DD 1348-1A. 5.  Leave  blank  when  transfer  of  all  details  with  the same  document  number  is  desired. 6.  Enter  the document  number  of  the authorized/in-use  detail  record from  which  the  item  is  being transferred. 7.  Enter  the quantity  of the  item  being  transferred.   This  number  should  be 5 digits  greater  than 00000 but not  more  than  the  in-use  quantity  on the losing  detail  record.  If the  item  is  a vehicle, then  the action  quantity  is 00001. 8.  Enter  the document  number  of  the authorized/in-use  detail  record to which  the  item  is  being transferred. a.  When  the  transfer  satisfies  a due-out,  the  due-out  or transferred  quantity  may  be canceled  by entering  the  due-out  document  number  date in  the  date field  of the  gaining  document  number. b.  When  an in-use  detail  record is  not loaded  for this  document  number  and input  stock number, the  FET program  will  establish  a substitute  detail  record (except  ASCs 000, 048, 985, and 987) if a prime  is  loaded. 9.  The  following  information  applies: a.  If  it  is necessary  to decrease the  authorized  quantity  on the losing  detail  record, enter  this  field.   Note:   The  quantity  in  this  field  must  be five  digits  and will  be subtracted  from  the  authorized quantity  on the  prime  record of  the losing  document  number.   The  quantity  entered  in  this  field cannot  exceed the  input  action  quantity  or the  authorized  quantity  on the  losing  record.  The quantity  in  this  field  is  NOT the  figure  that  you  will  enter  on the prime  detail  record.  EXAMPLE:   If  someone  is authorized  ten chairs  but needs only  eight,  enter  the  difference,  00002, in  this  field. (1)  The input may be under a substitute or prime  stock number.   The prime record will be located internally and adjusted when necessary. (2)  The  prime  and substitute  detail  records will  be deleted  if  three  conditions  exist  together:   if  the authorized  quantity  is  reduced to zero, if  no in-use  quantity  remains  on the  prime  or substitute detail  records, and if  no due-out detail  records are in  the  DBRA.   Note:   The authorized  quantity cannot  be reduced to zero if  any  in-use  or due-out  quantities  remain.   This  condition  will  result  in a 246 REJ  notice  (Auth  QTY Cannot  Be Reduced  to Zero With  O/H, Subs,  or D/O).  See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for  additional  information.   (3)  You may  use the  decrease quantity  field  with  the  increase  authorized  quantity  (see Note 9), by itself  or not  at all.   If  you  use both  the decrease and  increase  fields,  they  do not  have  to be equal  to each other. b.  If  no action  is required  on the authorized  quantity  of  the losing  detail  record, leave  this  field blank  or enter  all  zeros. 10.  The  following  information  applies: a.  If  the authorized  quantity  on the  gaining  authorized/in- use  detail  is to be increased,  enter  this field. (1)  The  quantity  in  this  field  will  be added to the authorized  quantity  on the  prime  detail  record of the  gaining  document  number.   EXCEPTION:   The  authorized  quantity  on a record with  a 000 632 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 ASC will  never  be increased  above zero.   Note:   The  figure  in  this  field  cannot  exceed the  input action  quantity.   EXAMPLE:   If someone  is  authorized  ten  chairs  but  needs fourteen,  enter  the difference,  00004, in  this  field. (2)  You can use this field when the decrease authorized  quantity (see Note 8) is used.  You can also use this field by itself or not at all.  If you use both the decrease and increase authorized quantity, they do not have to be equal to each other. b.  If  no action  is required  on the authorized  quantity  of  the gaining  authorized/in-use  detail  record, leave  this  field  blank. 11.  If  an item  is  being  transferred  to the  LRS/CC or Accountable  Officer-holding  account,  enter an H in  position  79. 12.

The transaction  quantity  by condition  code is  subtracted from  the AFEMS  database warehouse  balance  and the  result  in  the new  balance  is  less than  zero.   The transaction  quantity  is  computed  as follows:  (XGJ; in-use  qty + deployment  qty + unserviceable calibration  qty + unserviceable  maintenance  qty)  - (AFEMS; in-use  qty + deployment  qty + unserviceable  calibration  qty + unserviceable maintenance  qty). Corrective  Action: a.  Compare the  warehouse  balance  in  AFEMS via  the AWAB  screen with  the  SBSS balance  for the  stock number  and supply  condition  code in  the  XGJ.  If the balances  between the  SBSS and AFEMS are  equal then  clear  the reject  suspense  and generate  an  XJE by entering  an “X”  in  the “AC”  field  next  to the transaction  image  on the  AREJ  screen.  Do not resubmit  the XGJ with  the supply  condition  code. b.

Enter  an Action  Code “X”  next  to the  transaction  image  to delete  the suspense  and in  the case of DOC IDs XGJ, XGF,  XGG, or XGL to generate  an XJE  interrogation  to the SBSS. Refer  to Note 3 if  the FMC is  a D for any  of  these  DOC IDs or the supply  condition  code in  the  XGJ is  not blank.   2.  To report rejected  transactions  to AFEMS when  reverse  post action  is not  appropriate  or authorized  utilize  TRIC 2HQ (screen  133). Enter  the  original  transaction  from  the  AFEMS reject  suspense  file,  correct the  erroneous  data, change  the transaction  date to the current  date, and clear  the  suspense  within  AFEMS by entering  a “D”  next  to transaction  image.  This procedure  is  only  for  those  transactions  which  cannot  be resubmitted  via  the  AREJ  screen within  AFEMS utilizing  Action  Code “R”  (see Note 6).  3. Use the 2HQ as described  in  Note 2 to report:  XGJ, XGF, XGG,  or XGL  transactions  when the  FMC is  “D”  or the  supply  condition  code is  not blank  on the XGJ.  Clear the  suspense within  AFEMS by placing  an  Action  Code “X”  next  to the transaction  image  on the transaction day following  processing  of the  2HQ. 4. Contact  AFMC if  the  D24 or the  on-line  equipment  transaction  reporting  programs  are outputting  invalid  data.  5. MATRIX  of reason  codes. All  transactions  must  be type account  code “E”  and  EMC 4 or 5.  688 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 6.  The  following  AFEMS  (C001) DOC IDs can be corrected  and retransmitted  or resubmitted within  AFEMS by using  Action  Code “R”  next  to the  transaction  image  on the  AREJ  screen: XS2, XGH,  XGI,  XJU, XSA, XSB, XSC, XSD, XSK, BL0,  and B7A.   Corrective  action should  be initiated  within  the  SBSS, as applicable,  prior  to resubmittal  of the  listed  DOC IDs within  AFEMS. The  invalid  data on the  transaction  image  must  be corrected  prior  on the  AREJ screen  prior  to resubmittal  to AFEMS. 7. Reject  transactions  with  transaction  edit  codes AC, BD, DA, RB, and  RE will  not be displayed  on the  AREJ  screen  within  AFEMS. They  will  be displayed  one time  on the  daily CORRPT report available  in  OUTPUT  PRODUCTS and  should  be reviewed  for  corrective action  within  the  SBSS. Once corrective  action  is  taken with  inputs  to the  SBSS the appropriate  output  will  be sent  to AFEMS.  5.4.33.2.  A  cumulative  reject  suspense  file  of  all  SBSS  rejects  and  variances is maintained  in  AFEMS (C001).

Transmittal  Information. 5.4.67.3.1.  You  may  forward  the  AF Form  601 to the  addresses  shown  in  the  TO and FROM blocks  without  a letter  of  transmittal.  To save  time,  use  the  AF Form  601 as a cover sheet  for listings  or other  source  documents  when  the  same action  is  required  for multiple  items.  This  will  eliminate  transcribing  data  from  another  source  to  the  AF Form 601. When  listings  or source  documents  are attached  to the AF Form 601, be sure that  the  attachments  contain  complete  data for  processing.  The  EAE  will  only  forward AF Forms  601 to activities  above wing/base  level  for  those items  noted.  The EAE  will input  all  AF  Forms  601  received  from  the  equipment  custodians  into  the  AFEMS (C001) using  the  Data Transaction  Sessions  allowance  change  request  (TACR)  screen if  the  approval  is above wing/base  level.  DO NOT INCLUDE  classified  information  in requests  input  into  the  AFEMS (C001). 5.4.67.3.2.  One AF Form  601 for  multiple  items. 5.4.67.3.3.  Different  federal  supply  classes.   When  the request  is against  the same ASC and  when  background  and  justification  are  the  same  for  all  items,  you  may  include multiple  items  with  different  FSC on a single  AF Form 601 requiring  higher  than  base-level  approval.   These  requests  will  not be input  into  the  AFEMS (C001). 5.4.67.3.4.  CEMO-directed  actions.    For  CEMO-directed  actions,  you  may  include multiple  ASC and FSC items  on  a single  AF Form  601 if  all  items  are approved  at the same  level.   These  requests  will  not be input  into  the  AFEMS (C001). 5.4.67.3.5.  Individual  AF Forms  601 for  multiple  items.   Submit  individual  AF Forms 601  requests  for  items  which  require  individual  justification,  which  are  not  project-related,  or  which  require  stock  listing  action.    These  requests  will  be  input  into  the AFEMS (C001) if  approval  is above wing/base  level. 5.4.67.4.  Preparation  of AF Form 601. 5.4.67.4.1.  When  you prepare AF Form 601, use the instructions  on the reverse  side of the form.   The  information  in  this  attachment  explains  those  instructions  in  detail.   DO NOT use AF Forms  601a and 601b. 5.4.67.4.2.  TO.  Enter  the  military  address of the  office  that  reviews,  coordinates,  and processes the form.

Unless  otherwise  directed  by  this  volume  or  the  allowance standard,  the  signature  in  the block  will  be that  of the  LRS/CC or Accountable  Officer at base level  and the  CEMO or Director  of Supply  at command  level.   Do not  use  the signatures  of directors  or executive  officers,  etc., of  other  AF activities. 5.4.67.4.4.  action  taken.   These  blocks  remain  blank  when  the following  occurs: 5.4.67.4.4.1.  Returned  with  no action  taken.  The request is returned  without  action AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 735 for  additional  justification  or another  appropriate  reason. 5.4.67.4.4.2.  Approved  and returned.   The  request  is  being  returned  from  the  final approving  agency  down through  channels,  back to the originator.   EXAMPLE:   The MAJCOM approves  and forwards  it  to the  depot; the  depot approves  and returns  it to  the  command.

For serialized  items,  the document  will  include  the  serial  number  if  not accompanied  by an  F117 MGT  Notice. 2. If  an item  is  classified,  the  person  receiving  the  property  must  be authorized  in  writing  to receipt  for the  appropriate  level  of classified  property.  Document  Control  will  immediately  notify  the  LRS CC/AO and the  Security  Manager  when  an improper  signature  is  identified.  The  LRS CC/AO and Security Manager  will  determine  which  collateral  organizations  to notify  and  process their  decisions  according  to DoDM 5200.1, DoD  Information Security Program:  Overview, Classification, and Declassification  and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.  File  the  results  of the  investigation  with  the document.  The  words “Classified  Item”  must  be stamped  or hand-scribed  in  red ink  on all  source document  copies. 3. When  the  Base Automated  Service  Store System  is  used, the  name  is  entered  automatically. When  the  name  is  entered  with  an identaplate,  the  printed  name  is not  needed. 4. All  supply  documents  involving  nuclear  ordnance  commodity  management  (NOCM) items  must contain  a valid  ownership  or purpose  code of  “A”  (Air  Force-owned)  or “3”  (AEC-owned).  If  not automatically  printed,  the  codes may  be typed  or hand-written  by munitions  account  personnel. 5. The  following  information  applies: a. (FME/1ET)/FED.  Except  for (FME/1ET)/FED  output  made through  transportation,  all  other (FME/1ET)/FED  output  must  be signed  by the  receiving  or using  activity,  the  Materiel  Management Officer,  or the Equipment  Management  Supervisor.  Except  for deployments,  all  FME/1ET  output  must include  a statement  showing  why  accountability  was ended. In  addition,  attach  the  AF Form  2005 received  from  the  equipment  custodian  to the  FME EAID  accountability  termination  output  document for  those Federal  Supply  Class  6910 Base “L”  stock numbers  assigned  to destroyed  or mutilated  training vehicles  obtained  from  DLADS.  The  AF Form  2005 must  contain  the  following  information:  Block  A: equipment  custodians  rank,  name,  date, and phone  number;  columns  8-22: FSC 6910 Base “L”  stock AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 739 number;  columns  23-24: unit  of  issue;  columns  25-29: quantity;  columns  31-35: ORG/shop  code; columns  40-43: in-use  detail  number;  and column  E must  have  the  following  statement  and  signature  of the  equipment  custodian:  “Withdrawn  DLADS  vehicle  was destroyed  or mutilated  in  (type  training should  be stated) training  and will  be sent  to DLADS  as scrap metal.”   For FME/1ET  deployments  and transfers  made  through  the  LRS/transportation  activity  Cargo Movement  must  sign/date  blocks  22 and 23.  For off-base  ISU, DOR, FET,  and FED documents,  Packing  and Crating  must  sign  and date. b. Shipments: - At the  option  of the  LRS CC/AO, the  requirement  for  Storage and  Issue personnel  to forward serviceable  shipments  to Inspection  for  review  and signature  may  be waived.  If  this  option  is taken, Storage  and Issue  personnel  are responsible  for validating  the  condition  and documentation.  No additional  signatures  are required.   - Shipments  to an off-base  DLADS   will  be processed IAW AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5E, Document Control  and Detail  Records. - The  DD 1348-1A for  shipments  of motor  gasoline  (MOGAS) to nonbase-supported  vehicles  and to other  Department  of  Defense,  service,  or government  agencies  must  contain  the signature  of receipt  in block  22. - FED  receipt  and issue  documents  for rental  equipment  will  be signed  by the  Materiel  Management Officer  or a designated  representative.

ISU/DOR  documents  for  IEX  9 items  (health  hazard)  must  contain  the  name  and grade  of the certifying  official  and  the individual  requesting  the certification.  Organizations  using  the  health  hazard approval  listing  (HHAL)  will  write  or stamp  “HHAL  approved”  on the front  of  the document.  ISU/DOR with  activity  codes M, S, U, or W are exempt  from  this  procedure. 7. For mockup  and parachute  disassembly  only:  ISU and TIN documents  for  P and E activity  codes do not require  the signatures  of  Receiving  or Inspection  personnel;  however,  these  documents  must  be cross-referenced  to each  other and  bear the  approval  signature  of  the equipment  manager. 8. Conventional  munitions  ISU/DOR  documents  will  contain  the signature  or stamp  of the inspecting official  in  the Additional  Data block. 9. The  AFTO  Form  15 monitor  will  sign  DD 1348-1A for  those MSIs processed by the  FK account. 10. Bench  Stock managers  must  initial  or stamp  the DD  1348-1A on nonsensitive,  nonpilferable,  and nonclassified  BSU  issues  with  an extended  price  of  $999.99 or less.  All  other  issues  require  the signature of the  organizational  Bench  Stock Custodian. 11. When  the  original  quantity  is  circled  and a new  quantity  entered,  check the  transaction  quantity  to be sure  a shipped-short  or over-receipt  transaction  was processed. 12. If  a shortage  or overage  meets  the  criteria  for  reporting,  the document  must  have  an  SF 364, Report of Discrepancy attached.  If  the  receipt  is  on an I306 MGT  notice  output  from  processing  then  the inspector’s,  in-checker’s  and warehouse  personnel’s  signatures  or stamps  are not required. 13. Inspection  will  check shelf  life  items  it  receives  to be sure  the test and  expiration  information  is accurate.  The  inspector  or the  receiving  inchecker  must  sign  or stamp  the receiving  document  for  shelf 740 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 life  items  to verify  that  the shelf  life  information  shown  on the  tag or label  and paperwork are correct. In general,  shelf  life  code “0”  items  are exempt  from  this  quality  control  edit.  Inspection  will  inspect  shelf life  code “0”  items  only  when  Receiving  or Storage  personnel  identify  a possible  error in  the shelf  life assignment  or when  the  item  must  be inspected  for some  other  reason. 14. DD 1348-1A receipt  (I-306 MGT Notice)  generated  by processing  a TAR  with  an  “S”  in  position  7 does not  require  a signature. 15. Munitions  shipments  packed by munitions  personnel  will  contain  the  packer’s signature.  Shipments packed by LRS/transportation  activities  Packing  and  Crating  personnel  will  have  the LRS/transportation activity  representative’s  stamp  or signature  on the DD 1348-1A. 16. See below  for  specific  instructions: - If  a shipment  to DLADS  includes  a downgrade  certificate  signed  or stamped  by a LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  inspector,  then  the  receipt  copy is  valid  and no DLADS  signature  is  required. - If  a shipment  to DLADS  includes  a demilitarization  certificate  and  the header  STOCK NBR includes the  word “DESTROYED  or WASTE”,  then  the receipt  copy is  valid  and no DLADS  signature  is required. - If  a shipment  to DLADS  contains  condemned  radioactive  assets, then  an offline  shipment  document must  be signed  by the  LRS/transportation  activity  and filed  with  the  A5J transfer  document.   The  A5J must  be signed  by the  Chief,  Materiel  Management  Flight  or designated  representative.   17. On FCH and FCC documents  only,  block 27 must  contain  the reason  for  the FCH or FCC. (If more  space is  needed, the  reverse  side  may  be used.) On FCH documents,  the  certifying  official and the  approving  official  will  sign  in  blocks  26 and 27. Certifying  and approving  officials’  signatures are not required  for  munitions  supply  accounts  (FK). The  munitions  inspector’s  signature  or stamp  and supporting  inspection  documentation  (for  example,  AFTO  Form  102) will  satisfy  the  certification  and approval  requirement.  For warehouse  change  documents,  the signature  or stamp  of the individual  making the  inspection,  when  requested  by storage  personnel,  is  also required. 18. At the  option  of  the LRS  CC/AO, FCC transactions  involving  the warranted  tools  program,  may  be processed by Base Service  Store personnel.  When  the LRS CC/AO elects  this  option,  Base Service  Store personnel  will  sign  the FCC in  lieu  of inspection  personnel. 19. For COMSEC equipment  items,  the  equipment  custodian  must  sign  or initial  all  documents.  For COMSEC supply  point  items,  the  supply  point  monitor  must  sign  or initial  all  documents.  The  following exceptions  to this  procedure  may  occur, but  note 2 applies  regardless  of  the option used: - When  off-base  organizations  pick  up COMSEC items  from  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity, the  organization  representative  may  sign  for the  items.  A letter  designating  the authorized  representative and signed  by the organization  commander  must  be on file  in  Document  Control  at the  point  where  the items  are picked  up. - When  LRS/transportation  activity  channels  are used, note  5 applies. 20. For Civil  Engineer  bulk  items  delivered  to dispersed  job sites:  Delivery  tickets  and call  register, signed  by the person  that  received  the  property,  will  be attached  to the Document  Control  copy of-the AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 741 manual  receipt.  The  manual  issue  documents,  cross-referenced  to the  receipt  document,  do not require signature.  The  inspector’s  stamp  is  not required  on the receipt  document. 21. For Automated  Warehouse  System  users, process using  FCH/FCC. 22. If  the quantity  differs,  check  the next  and prior  transactions  to see if  two transactions  were generated.   If  two transactions  were generated,  then  only  the  single  source  document  should  be filed. 23. Bases that  use  SF 44, Purchase-Invoice-Voucher, for  on-the-spot,  over-the-counter  purchase  of materiel  may  recognize  the  signature  on the  SF 44 as proof  of receipt.  The  SF 44 will  be attached  to an ISU or DOR. 24. At the  option  of  the LRS  CC/AO, Document  Control  will  not  return  non-fileable  documents  to the generating  activity  for quality  edits  (such  as, selected-by  and date).  25. If  an item  is  NWRM, the person  receiving  the  property  must  be authorized  in  writing  to receipt  for the  item.  Document  Control  will  immediately  notify  the LRS  CC/AO and the unit  Security  Manager when  an improper  signature  is  identified.  The  LRS CC/AO and Security  Manager  will  determine  which collateral  organizations  to notify  and  process their  decisions  according  to DoD 5200.1/AFI 31-401. File the  results  of  the investigation  with  the  document.  The  words "Classified  NWRM-Item"  must  be stamped or hand-scribed  in  red ink  on all  source  document  copies. 5.5.2.  Delinquent  Source Document  Update. 5.5.2.1.  Purpose.  To  retrieve,  add,  change,  or  delete  DSD  records  on  the  SBLC database. 5.5.2.2.  Program  Logic.  In updating  delinquent  source  documents,  Program  NGV784, Delinquent  Source  Document  Update, does the following: 5.5.2.3.  Edits  the TRIC  inputs  1DS and 1DU transactions  for  validity. 5.5.2.4.  Retrieves  delinquent  source  document  records using  the document  number  in the  1DS input. 5.5.2.5.  Builds  1DU  output  screen  from  data  on  the  DSD  record.  If  more  than  one record  is  located  for  the  input  document  number,  the  program  formats  and  writes  the output  to the  Paging  File. 5.5.2.6.  Adds DSD records to the  database when  the action  code is A. 5.5.2.7.  Changes  or  deletes  DSD  records  on  the  database  using  the  1DU  input  with action  code C or D. 5.5.2.8.  Paging  File.  Paging  provides  a reserved  storage  area  on  the  SBLC  for  each terminal,  an area which  each terminal  can  use for  storage  and retrieval  of  CTH online process. Paging  allows  you  to view  the  data stored  in  these  areas.       Note:   A paging file  area  is  assigned  to  each  terminal  and  is  unique  to  that  terminal.  It  can  only  be accessed from  the  terminal  on  which  it  was created.  The  paging  file  area is associated with  the  functional  identification  number,  not  with  the  user  identification  number. There  is  NOT a master  paging  file.  Each  record written  to the  Paging  File  represents  a data page. Data  pages can  accumulate  in  the Paging  File  until  the  user deletes  the  file. The  program  automatically  writes  multiple  records for  one document  number  into  this file.  Users may  call  in  paging,  check the  file  status,  review  the  data in  paging,  and then exit  or delete  paging. 742 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.5.2.9.  Paging  File  Access.  When  accessing  the  Paging  File,  enter  PAG  and  press <ENTER>.  Any  time  the  Paging  File  is  entered,  page  1 of  the  Paging  File  displays. Formats  other  than  the  Delinquent  Source  Document  Update  images  might  well  be in the file  since  the program  adds pages as it  creates them.  If your  output  is only  one page and  the  Paging  File  is  empty,  your  output  appears as page  1 of  the  Paging  File.  If  the page needed  is not  page 1, users  must  scan the  file  to find  the applicable  pages. 5.5.2.10.  File  Scanning.  There  are three  ways  for  users  to reach  the desired  page once they  are in  the Paging  File.  They  can  do the following: 5.5.2.11.  Move  forward  page-by-page  in  the  Paging  File  by  pressing  the  F1 functio n key. 5.5.2.12.  Move backward  page-by-page  by pressing  the  F2 function  key. 5.5.2.13.  Move directly  to the desired  page by entering  the page number  into  the status line  and pressing  <ENTER>. 5.5.2.14.  Status  Line.  Each  time  a  new  page  displays,  the  Paging  File  status  line appears at the  bottom  of  the screen  and contains  the following: 5.5.2.15.  Index  Page Count.  The  IPC always  shows zero.  This  status  does not apply  to the  SBSS. 5.5.2.16.  Data  Page  Count.  The  DPC shows  the  total  number  of  pages  in  the  Paging File. 5.5.2.17.  Current  Page  Number.  The  CPN shows  the  page  number  of  the  displayed page. The  CPN is  always  1 when  the  user enters  the Paging  File. 5.5.2.18.  Start-of-Entry  Symbol.  The start-of-entry  symbol  (>) on the status line  allows the  user  to enter  the  required  page  number  and  press <ENTER>  to locate  the  required page. 5.5.2.19.  Exit  Command.  The exit  command  (EX)  lets  the user exit  the paging  file  and keeps  the  record/input  image  displayed  on  the  screen  for  further  action.  The  exit command  does not  delete  the  records from  the  Paging  File;  it  simply  exits  the  paging program  leaving  the current  record displayed  for further  action.  Exiting  allows  records to  accumulate the  delete  command  deletes  records. WARNING:  Be  sure  you  do  not  press  <ENTER>  after  exiting  paging  UNLESS  the displayed  information  is  an input,  for example,  a reverse-post. the  Paging  File;  only in 5.5.2.20.  Status  Command.  The  status  command  (ST) is  responsible  for displaying  the IPC, DPC, and CPN. Currently,  the status  command  is  program  controlled. 5.5.2.21.  Delete  Command.  The  delete  command  (DEL)  lets  the  user  exit  the  Paging File  and deletes  all  the  information  in  the  file,  leaving  the  current  record displayed  for further  action.  Note:  Never use delete  until  you  have  completed  all  processing. 5.5.3.  Processing  TRIC 1DS.  The  document  number  is  the  only  mandatory  entry  when processing  TRIC  1DS. However,  enter  any  data  available  to  help  identify  the  delinque nt source  document.  The  only  purpose  of  this  input  is  to  locate  and  retrieve  a  delinque nt source  document  record.  Users  enter  TRIC  1DS  or  #410  to  call  in  the  DELINQUENT SOURCE DOCUMENT  INQUIRY screen  and make  the  applicable  entries. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 743 Figure  5.15.  Delinquent  Source Document  Inquiry.  5.5.3.1.  No  Record  Located.  If  there  is  no  record  loaded,  the  Delinquent  Source Document  Update, screen  1DU:  /411, displays.  The user  can either  exit  the program  or enter  a delinquent  source document. 5.5.3.2.  Record  Located.  If  a  record  is  located  for  the  input  document  number,  the Delinquent  Source  Document  Update,  screen  1DU:/  411,  displays  with  the  data elements  from  the record on the screen. After  exiting  paging  with  the record displayed, users  can  change  any  element  screened  (except  the  document  number),  delete  the record, or exit  the  1DU program. 5.5.3.3.  Multiple  Records Located. When  TRIC 1DS locates  multiple  records with  the same  document  number,  the  program  writes  each  record  to the  Paging  File  as  TRIC 1DU record/input  images.  The Paging  File  lets users scan the records written  there;  but, they  CANNOT  change  or  delete  delinquent  source  document  records  while  in  the Paging  File.  Users  must  exit  the  Paging  File  using  the  DEL  option  of  paging  and leaving  the  record  displayed.  Then,  make  changes  or  deletions,  enter  the  applicable action  code, and transmit.  To clear  additional  DSDs, repeat the  1DS/1DU  process. 5.5.3.4.  Reviewing  1DU  Images.  Once  the  input  is  located,  the  user  reviews  the delinquent  source  document  record  images.  Upon  completing  your  review,  take  the action  to delete  (DEL)  or exit  (EX)  the terminal  paging  program. 5.5.3.5.  Deleting  the  Paging  File.  Move  the  cursor  to  the  delete  command  and  press <ENTER>.  The  delete  command  (DEL)  deletes  all  the  records  in  the  Paging  File, leaving  the  current  record displayed  for further  action.  For example,  if  you  queried  the delinquent  source document  file  then  processed a reverse-post,  both the 1D records and the  reverse-post  records would  be in  the  Paging  File.  Deleting  one  page or one record would  delete  ALL  the  pages  or  records.  Be  sure  you  complete  all  processing  before you  delete.  We  recommend  that  you  delete  the  Paging  File  after  you  complete  a process. For example,  complete  the  DSD update then  delete  the  file. 5.5.3.6.  Exiting  the  Paging  File.  Move  the  cursor  to  the  exit  command  and  press <ENTER>.  The displayed  information  is now  active.  Users may  now print  the contents of a screen  or take any  available  screened  option. 5.5.3.7.  Printing  a  Delinquent  Source  Document  Screen.  To  print  the  contents  of  a screen  produced  from  a  delinquent  source  document  inquiry  transaction,  press  the the  screened PRINT  key  (or  SHIFT  and  PRINT  key  together) to  force  print 744 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 information.  If  a  screen  print  of  more  pages  or  records  is  needed,  access  the  Paging File,  locate  the page, and print.  After printing  the last  item,  cursor to DEL, and transmit.  5.5.4.  Processing  TRIC  1DU.  If  loading  a  new  record,  process  the  Delinquent  Source Document  Inquiry  (TRIC  1DS)  request.

Overview. 5.5.6.1.1.  Section  Summary.  This  section  provides  Document  Control  procedures for bases that have  ES-S Management  System   installed.  This  section  also provides instructions  on how to identify  and correct mismatches  between  ES-S Management System    and  SBSS,  and  how  to work  the  Delinquent  Document  Listing  (R59)  in ES-S Management  System. 5.5.6.2.  Document  Control  Process. 5.5.6.2.1.  ES-S  Management  System    uses  Smart  card  technology to  provide electronic  signature  and  filing  for  the  following  auditable  SBSS documents:  ISU, MSI,  A5J,  SHP,  A2(x),  A4(x),  DOR  and  BSU.  ES-S Management  System   also sends  a 1SI transaction  to the  SBSS  that  clears  the  document  control  record.  For receipt  and turn-in  transactions  if  the ES-S Management  System   flag  is  on and the REC or TIN is  processed on function  803, a document  control  record is not created. On BSU  documents  the  1SI is  sent  to the  SBSS when  the  document  is  pulled  not when  it  is delivered. 5.5.6.3.  There  are  instances  when  the  1SI  transaction  rejects  in  the  SBSS  and  the document  control  record is  not cleared.  When  this  occurs, the document  will  appear on the  R59 if  not cleared. 5.5.6.3.1.  In  order  to prevent  documents  from  appearing  on the  R59 due  to a 1SI reject, it  is necessary  to check ES-S Management  System   for  1SI rejects daily.  1SI rejects  do  not  appear  on  the  SBSS  reject  listing  and  must  be  reviewed  in  ES-S Management  System  .  It  is  recommended  that  a  reject  report  is  produced  daily selecting  TRIC 1SI for the  current  day and one  day prior. 5.5.6.3.2.  There  are four  possible  rejects  for a 1SI transaction,  which  are 643, 644, 645,  and  799.  A  643  and  799  reject  require  action,  the  other  two  rejects  are informational  only.  To clear  a 799 reject, the  user must  go to Delivery  History  and review  the document  that  caused  the  1SI reject  and re-send the 1SI. The  799 reject is  normally  the  result  of  the  CTH  area  being  down  when  the  1SI  attempted  to process. See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for clearing  643 rejects. 5.5.6.4.  If  ES-S  Management  System   is  used  to  create  Degraded  Operations documents,  accomplish  the  following  procedures  to  ensure  that  all  transactions  are posted and Delinquent  Source Documents  (DSDs)  are cleared. 5.5.6.4.1.  Produce  the ES-S Management  System   Created Not Delivered  and ES-S  Management  System    Created  Deliveries  Reports  to  verify  that  all  Degraded Operations  deliveries  created  in  ES-S Management  System   have  been processed. 5.5.6.4.2.  After  Degraded  Operations  transaction  have  been  processed  in  the SBSS, the transaction  serial  number  must  be updated in  ES-S Management  System using  the Update Delivery  History  option,  then  send the 1SI transaction  to clear  the DCC image  in  the  SBSS. 5.5.6.5.  The  Process  R59 Delinquent  Documents  function  allows  a user  to import  the R59 print  listing  into  ES-S Management  System  . Once the  file  is  imported  into  ES-S 748 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 Management  System,  the user  can produce  a listing  that  reflects  information  about  the documents  on the  R59. 5.5.6.5.1.  To import  the R59, the  R59 print  file  must  be placed  in  the directory  on the  ES-S  Management  System    server  that  is  designated  as  the  Update  Files Location  in  the  System  Parameter  menu. 5.5.6.5.2.  Once the  R59 print  listing  has been placed in  the correct directory  on the server,  select  the Process R59 Delinquent  Documents  option  from  the Maintenance Menu,  then  enter  the filename  of  the R59 print  file  and depress the process button. 5.5.6.5.3.  ES-S  Management  System    will  check  the  Delivery  History  table  for each  document  on  the  R59 as it  is  imported  and if  the  document  number  is  found and it  has been delivered  to a customer  a 1SI transaction  will  be formatted  and sent to the SBSS to clear  the DCC. The Delinquent  Documents  report will  show if  a 1SI was sent. 5.5.7.  Asset Management Document  Control  Procedures. 5.5.7.1.

Delinquent  TRIC Record Update  (NGV786). 5.5.8.1.  Purpose.  To  load,  change,  delete  or  list  delinquent  TRIC  records.  The delinquent  TRIC records contain  the  transaction  identification  code and the applicable delinquent  and  pre-delinquent  day  criteria.  This to  determine delinquency. record  is  used 5.5.8.2.  Program  Logic.  Program  NGV786, Delinquent  TRIC  Record  Update  (TRIC 1DQ, screen  #412), performs  the  following  functions: 5.5.8.2.1.  Edits  the  input  1DQ transaction  for validity. 5.5.8.2.2.  Loads,  changes,  deletes,  or  lists  the  CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC  records based on the  input  action  code. 5.5.8.2.2.1.  If  the  input  action  code  equals  A,  the  program  reads  the  CT-DELINQUENTSOURCE  record. If  a record exists,  an error message  displays. If  a record does not exist,  the program  stores  the record on the  database. 5.5.8.2.2.2.  If  the  input  action  code equals  C or D, the  program  reads the  CT-DELINQUENTSOURCE  record.  If  no  record  is  located,  an  error  message displays.  If  there  is  a record located,  the  program  updates  or deletes  the record on the  database. 5.5.9.  Processing  TRIC  1DQ.  Users  can  add, change  or delete  from  one  to  20 records with  one  input  screen.  If  more  than  20  records  require  updating,  repeat  the  process.  An error message  displays  identifying  those  TRICs  not loaded,  changed,  or deleted.  All  other TRICs,  not  in  error,  will  process.  Users  enter  TRIC  1DQ  or  #412  to  call  in  the  DELINQUENT  DOCUMENT  TRIC UPDATE  screen and  make the  applicable  entries. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 749 Figure  5.17.  Delinquent  Document  TRIC Update  Screen.  5.5.9.1.  Enter  the  TRIC  code of  the  record to add, change  or delete.  Each  TRIC  code entered  represents  a single  record. The user may  enter delinquent  criteria  for a range  of TRICs  by  entering  an  asterisk  (*)  in  the  third  position  of  the  TRIC  field  (that  is,  use FE* for all  TRICs  FEC, FED,  FER, FET and  FEX.) 5.5.9.2.  Enter  the number  of days (01-99) before a document  with  the designated  TRIC will  become  delinquent  or  pre-delinquent.  The  Delinquent  Document  Listing (R59/NGV781)  program  uses this  number  in  determining  whether  a record appears on the  delinquent  or pre-delinquent  list. 5.5.9.3.  Enter  action  code A to load  a record. Press <ENTER>  to load the TRIC. If  the TRIC  is  on  the  database  file,  an  error  message  TRIC  ALREADY  EXISTS  ON FILE displays.  If the  current  database  information  is  correct, no  further  action  is  required.  If the information  as it is stored on the database is  incorrect,  delete the current  informa t io n and re-input  the correct  information. 5.5.9.4.  Enter  action  code C to change  a record. Press <ENTER>  to enter  the  change. You  cannot  change  TRIC  codes; but, you  can  change  the  delinquent  or pre-delinque nt criteria.  If  no  TRIC  is  located,  an  error  message  NO  TRIC  RECORD  ON  FILE displays.  When  this  appears, decide if  the  record must  be added to the  database. If  it  is to be added, use the  add procedures  in  the  above paragraph  to load a new  record. 750 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.5.9.5.  Enter  action  code D to delete a record. Press <ENTER>.  If no record is located, an  error  message  TRIC  NOT  ON FILE  displays  and  no  further  action  is  required. Delete  all  records containing  invalid  TRIC codes. 5.5.9.6.  Enter  action  code L to list  the records.  Press <ENTER>. 5.5.9.6.1.  If  no  records  are  located,  an  error  message  TRICS  NOT  ON FILE  or FILE  NOT LOADED  displays.  If the  file  is  not  loaded,  reload  the  database file  by reprocessing  a  load  of  all  previously  loaded  TRIC  information  using  the  load procedures. 5.5.9.6.2.  If  records  are  located,  they  are  written  to  the  Paging  File  in  screen format,  and  the  first  sixteen  TRIC  codes  display.  Each  sixteen  records  represents one data page in the Paging  File.  Users can scan the Paging  File  to see which  TRICs are listed  and to determine  if  additions,  changes,  or deletions  are needed.        Note:  Remember,  users  cannot  make  any  changes  while  in  the  Paging  File.  They  must exit  the  Paging  File  and make  the changes  using  the SBLC screen. 5.5.9.6.3.  Enter  action  code E to end the  processing  without  update. 5.5.9.6.4.  Output.  The  list  of  delinquent  document  TRIC  records  is  a  screen display.  To  get  a  printed  copy,  use  the  PRINT  SCREEN  function  from  the computer.  Following  is an example  of a Delinquent  Document  TRIC Update screen listing  the  TRIC records: Table 5.216.

When  Document  Control  receives  the DD 1348-1A from  LRS/transportation  activity,  enter  the following  shipment  data: 754 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 a. Shipment  Data.  Figure  5.19.  Shipment  Data.  5.5.14.  Standard  Base Supply  System  (SBSS)/Cargo  Movement  Operations  System (CMOS) Interface Document  Control  Procedures. 5.5.14.1.  Section  Summary.  This  section  provides  the document  control  procedures  for the  SBSS/  CMOS  interface  once  it  is  implemented.  This  section  provides  a  brief explanation  of  the  SBSS  and  CMOS interface  and  identifies  the  specific  procedures and processes. 5.5.14.2.  SBSS/CMOS Interface.  The  SBSS/CMOS interface  establishes  an electronic interface  between  the SBSS and the LRS/transportation  activity.  The interface  provides the  LRS/transportation  activity  with  timely  data  to  effectively  plan,  control,  and schedule  into  the  transportation  pipeline  shipments,  transfers,  and  issues  to  off-base organizations  and  maximize the  use  of  LRS/transportation  activity  resources  and reduce  transportation  cost.  In  addition,  it  allows  the  LRS/transportation  activity  to preplan  consolidation  of  shipment,  transfers,  and  issues  and  to  select  the  mode  of shipment  based  on  priority.  The  CMOS  provides  the  SBSS  with  electronic  record images  when  the LRS/transportation  activity  receives  outbound  cargo, and it  continues to  provide  shipment  status  information  to  the  SBSS  until  the  cargo  is  released  for shipment. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 755 5.5.15.  Document  Control  Process. 5.5.15.1.  Acknowledgment  of  Receipt.  The  SBSS/CMOS  interface  eliminates the requirement  for  a  signature  on  the  shipment,  issue  to  off-base  organizations,  and transfer  documents  processed  from  the  SBSS to  the  LRS/transportation  activity.  The LRS/transportation  activity  acknowledges  receipt  of these  documents  to the SBSS with an electronic  image  of a shipment  suspense  record from  CMOS which  updates the SNC detail  or the  shipment  suspense  card  (SSC) detail  record  with  an  inchecker  code and inchecked  date. Signatures  are required,  however,  for  the‚  following  items: 5.5.15.1.1.  Classified  and NWRM Items.  Documents  will  be signed/stamped  by an authorized  individual  who  is  on  the  receipt  authorization  listing.  If  the  individ ua l who  signed  the  document listing,  process documents in  accordance  with  procedures  in  AFMAN  23-122,  Ch  5E,  Sec Document  Control  and Detail  Records. is  not  on  the  receipt  authorization 5.5.15.1.2.  COMSEC Items.  Shipment  documents  must  be signed/stamped  by  the LRS/transportation  activity  and processed in  accordance  with  AFMAN 23-122, Ch 5E, Sec Document  Control  and Detail  Records. 5.5.15.1.3.  Sensitive  Items:  Documents  must  be  signed/stamped  by  authorized LRS/transportation  activity  personnel  and processed. 5.5.15.2.  Quality  Control:  When the SBSS is operating  under these  CMOS procedures, quality  control  of  shipments,  transfers,  and  issues  to  off-base  organizations  is  not required.        Note:    When  the  CMOS  flag  is  on,  document  control  records  are  not produced  for shipments,  transfers,  and issues  to off-base  organizations 5.5.15.3.  Degraded  Operations.  Shipment,  transfer,  and  issue  documents  to  off-base organizations  will  be  signed/stamped  by  an  authorized  LRS/transportation  activit y person.  These  documents  should  be placed  in  a temporary  file  until  SBSS processing is  completed.  Once the  shipment  data is  known,  process an  SSC to update  the  SNC or SSC details. 5.5.15.4.  Document  Filing.  Shipment, to  off-base organizations  which  were  processed  using  CMOS procedures  are  not  required  to  be filed;  however,  the LRS  CC/AO may  decide  to establish  batch files. transfer,  and  issue  documents 5.5.15.5.  Delinquent  Documents:  When  the  CMOS  flag  is  on  during  follow- up, program  NGV588  reads  the  shipment  suspense  detail  record,  shipped-not-credited detail,  and  creates  a follow-up  (TRIC  1LY)  to the  CMOS system  using  the  following delinquent  logic: 5.5.15.5.1.  First  Follow-up: information  and  the  follow- up indicator  are blank  and  the  DOLT  is  older  than  5 days,  program  NGV588 moves an  A  to  the  follow-up  indicator  and  outputs  a  TRIC  1LY,  which  is  then  sent electronically  to the CMOS system. If  the  inchecker 5.5.15.5.2.  Second Follow-up:  If the inchecker  information  is  blank,  the follow- up indicator  is an  A, and the DOLT  is older  than  10 days, program  NGV588 moves  a B  to  the  follow-up is  then  sent electronically  to the CMOS system. indicator  and  outputs  a  TRIC  1LY,  which 756 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.5.15.5.3.  Update  of  Details.  The  CMOS response  to  the  TRIC  1LY  is  a  TRIC SSC  which  is  automatically  processed  on  the  SBSS  to  update  the  SSC  or  SNC details. 5.5.16.  Consolidated  Transaction  History Processing. 5.5.16.1.  The  CTH System  is  a computerized  compilation  of daily  transaction  records located  in  a reserved  area  of  the  SBLC.  It is  possible  to store  up  to  one  year  of  CTH records.  Using  these  compiled  records,  users  can  search  the  CTH  area to reverse-post transactions,  to make  inquiries,  and to control  documents. 5.5.16.2.  Anyone  who has ever had to use the D06, Daily  Transaction  Listing,  will  find the ease and speed of using  the CTH process an improvement.  Reverse-post  processing builds  reverse-post  inputs  from  the stored CTH records. (See AFM 23-122, Sec 5G for automated  reverse-post  procedures.)  CTH inquiry  process allows  users  to research  and compile  transactions  in  a user defined  sequence. 5.5.16.3.  Document  Control  uses the  applicable  ILS-S to clear  the DCR and to update the document  file  code. The system  also  makes changes  in  function  numbers  and in  the OPR to control  delinquent  documents  identified  on the  Delinquent  Document  Listing. 5.5.16.4.  Security  Responsibilities.  Security  measures  are  the  responsibilities  of  the applicable  end users. 5.5.17.  Consolidated  Transaction  History Processing. transaction  history  software 5.5.17.1.  The  consolidated release  requires  DMC personnel  to establish  the CTH  reserved  area on  the SBSS SBLC. Once the  CTH  area is  established,  RPS  operators  process  the  Create  Consolidated  Transaction  History Control  Record,  Program  NGV225,  to  create  the  CTHISTORY-CONTROL  record (711) and the CT-SUPPORT record (710). This  program  is always  available;  however, reprocessing  it should  be a last  resort  because it  requires  a complete  reimplementat io n.  5.5.17.2.  CTH File.  Users may  start  their  CTH File  in  one of  two ways: 5.5.17.2.1.  Begin  with  the  merge  of  the  current  day's  transactions.  This  starts  the CTH File  from  the  date of  implementation.  See AFM 23-122 for  the  CTH Record Merge  (D37/NGV778)  program. 5.5.17.2.2.  Load  tapes  on  which  previous  transactions  are  stored.  Process  CTH Record  Load  (UTL043)  using tapes  created  by  Daily  Transaction  Dump (NGV055),  Transaction  History  Merge  (NGV056),  and  CTH  Record  Download (UTL041).   Program  NGV043 reads the  transactions  stored  on the  magnetic  tapes to the CTH area of the SBSS database. At the completion  of the  last UTL043,  CTH Record  Load,  manually  process  a  D37,  CTH  Merge,  loading  the  current  day's transactions  into  the  CTH  area.  From  this  point  on,  the  CTH  Merge,  program D37/NGV778,  will  load each  new day's transactions  in  the  CTH database. 5.5.17.3.  Daily  CTH  Merge.  The  Daily  CTH  Merge  (D37/NGV778)  does  the following  during  crossover: 5.5.17.3.1.  Scans  the  daily  transaction  history  area  and  merges  selected  records into  the CTH File. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 757 5.5.17.3.2.  Creates additional  records for each history  record merged  and modifies one record for each date loaded into  the CTH area. The additional  records, 701 (CT-DATE),  702  (CT-STOCKNUMBER),  703  (CT-SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR),  and 705 (CT-SERIAL-NUMBER)  serve  as  entry  points  for  quick  access  to the  stored CTH  records.  The  modified  record,  711 (CT-CONTROL- RECORD),  contains  a record  of  all  dates loaded  to the  CTH area  and  the  PURGE  or  oldest  date on  file. Additionally,  it  creates  a  707  (CT-DOCUMENT-CONTROL)  record  (DCR)  for each CTH history  requiring  a DCR. The following  is a list  of those  records. 5.5.17.3.2.1.  CT-DATE  Record (701). 5.5.17.3.2.2.  CT-STOCK-NUMBER Record (702). 5.5.17.3.2.3.  CT-SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR  Record (703). 5.5.17.3.2.4.  CT-SERIAL-NUMBER  Record (705). 5.5.17.3.2.5.  CT-HISTORY-CONTROL  Record  (711).         Note:  For dates loaded  from  a 056 tape using  report  UTL043,  CTH RECORD  LOAD,  the first date  loaded  on  the  tape  will  be  the  only  day  reflected  on  the  711  (CT-HISTORY-CONTROL)  record;  however,  all  dates  loaded  will  appear  as  an individual  701-CT-DATE  record.  For  days loaded  by  the  D37,  Daily Transaction  Merge,  each  date  loaded  is  reflected  on  both  the  711  (CT-HISTORY-CONTROL)  and 701 (CT-DATE)  records. 5.5.17.3.2.6.  CT-DOCUMENT-CONTROL record (707) for  each CTH record that  needs  a  DCR  (see  Pt  4,  Ch  14).  18.29.4.  CTH  Download.  CTH  records remain  on the database until  downloaded  to magnetic  tape and deleted  from  the database. The  CTH Record Download  (UTL041)  program  is used  to download records to the magnetic  tape. 5.5.17.4.  Errors. Whenever  you  suspect an error in the load or maintenance  of the CTH area,  process  the  CTH  Record  Verification  (UTL042)  program.  This  program  counts all  the  records  for  specified  dates  and  compares  the  totals  with  the  CT-HISTORY-CONTROL  record.  If  the  totals  are  unequal,  the  output  listing  shows  the  dates  and records  that  are in  error. Corrective  action  is  then  required.  If  the  totals  are equal,  the output  shows  the  totals  and the  dates. 5.5.18.  Document  Control  Records. 5.5.18.1.  DCR  are database records  maintained  on the  SBLC.  DCRs  are updated  and maintained  through  a PC interface  with  the  SBLC. 5.5.18.2.  Creating  Document  Control  Records.  During  crossover,  the  Consolidated History  Record  Merge  (D37/NGV778)  program  scans  the  daily  transaction  history records.  The  program  selects  and  merges  all  printable  transactions,  then  creates  and stores  a  document  control  record  (707)  in  the  database  file.  See Pt  4,  for  the  record format  of a DCR. 5.5.18.3.  Clearing  Document  Control  Records.  When  Document  Control  receives documents,  they  perform  the  quality  control  checks.  After  the  quality  control  checks are  completed,  Document  Control  uses  the  applicable  ILS-S  to  retrieve  the  DCR  in order to update  the document  file  code for  each document. 758 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.5.18.4.  Document  File  Codes. The  document  file  code does two  things:  1) it  shows whether  to destroy  or file  a document  in  the  document  file,  and  2) it  shows  receipt  of and processing  of  a fillable  or destroyable  document  with  one  exception.  All  Materiel Management   activities  will  retain  all  source  documents  with  TRICs  ISU,  TIN, REC, DOR,  MSI, SHP, AXA,  BSU,  FCH, and  FCU for  75 months  (6 years  and  3  months) regardless  of  what  is  in  position  53. Following  are  the  four  document  file  codes and their  definition: 5.5.18.4.1.  Code F. Code F identifies  the  document  as a file  document  for filing  in the  document  file. 5.5.18.4.2.  Code D. Code D identifies  the document  as a document  to be destroyed after  validation. 5.5.18.4.3.  Code  C.  Code  C  identifies  receipt,  processing,  and  filing  of  a  file document. 5.5.18.4.4.  Blank.  A blank  identifies  receipt  of a document  to be destroyed  and that the  document  was destroyed  after  verification. 5.5.18.5.  Updating  Document  File  Codes. Document  file  codes are updated  under  the following  conditions: 5.5.18.5.1.  When  a  file  document  passes  the  quality  control  checks,  Document Control  uses  the  applicable  ILS-S to change  the  F to a C. Next,  the  SBLC  update occurs  through  the  PC interface.  The  SBLC program  deletes  the  document  control record, then  retrieves  the applicable  CTH record and updates its document  file  code. Document  Control  files  the document  according  to instructions  in  AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5E, Document  Control  and Detail  Records. 5.5.18.5.2.  If  a  document  to  be  filed  does  not  pass  the  quality  control  edits, Document  Control  returns  it  to the  customer.  No action  occurs  on the  DCR. 5.5.18.5.3.  When  a  document  to  be  destroyed  passes  the  quality  control  checks, Document  Control  uses  the applicable  ILS-S to change  the D to a blank.   Next, the SBLC  update  occurs  through  the  PC  interface.  The  SBLC  program  deletes  the document  control  record, then  retrieves  the  applicable  CTH record  and updates  its document  file  code.  Document  Control  destroys  the source  document. 5.5.18.5.4.  If  a document  to  be destroyed  does not  pass  the  quality  control  edits, Document  Control  personnel  return  the document  to the customer.  No action  occurs on the  DCR 5.5.19.  Delinquent  Source Document. 5.5.19.1.  Document  Control  is responsible  for adding,  changing,  and deleting  the DSD records on the  database. Delinquent  source  documents  are one of the  following: 5.5.19.2.  Source  Document  with  no  DCR.  Any  transaction  document  that  reaches Document  Control  that  does not  have  a matching  document  control  record  is  a DSD. This  occurs  when  a transaction  was not  entered  on the daily  transaction  register. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 759 5.5.19.3.  DCR with  Missing  Source  Document.  Any  time  a transaction  is  merged  and the  DCR  is  created  but  the  source  document  is  missing,  the  missing  source  document becomes  a delinquent  source document. 5.5.20.  Delinquent  Document  Listing. that the  RPS  processes 5.5.20.1.  Document  Control  makes  sure the  DDL (R59/NGV781)  at  the  end  of  each  workday.  The  DDL  contains  delinquent  and  pre-delinquent  document  control  records and all  delinquent  source  document  records.  It is a two-part  listing.  Document  Control  is  responsible  for  keeping  the  delinquent  TRIC table  and  the  function  numbers  and OPRs updated. The  Delinquent  Document  Listing (R59/NGV781)  program  uses  the  TRIC  table  in  determining  delinquent  days.  It  uses the  function  number/OPR  for  page  eject  requirements  in  part  two  of  the  listing.  Part two of the DDL is separated by function  number/OPR  and distributed  to the responsible OPR. 5.5.20.2.  Delinquent  TRIC  Record.  Document  Control  uses  TRIC  1DQ, screen  #412, to  update  the  CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC  record  with the  TRIC  codes,  and  pre-delinquent  and delinquent  days.  This  record is  used by the  DDL  program  to determine delinquency.  Para 5.5.8 gives  the procedures  for updating  the delinquent  TRIC record.  5.5.20.3.  Function  Number  and OPR. Document  Control  uses TRIC 1DP, screen #415, to  update  the  CT-DELINQUENT-OPR  (709)  records  on  the  database.  This  record (709) contains  the  function  numbers  and the  OPRs. The  function  number  is  the output terminal  number  from  the  transaction  history  record  for  the  applicable  document control  record. 5.5.20.4.  Delinquent  Date.  Document  Control  uses  TRIC  1AQ, screen  #503, to enter, change,  or  delete  the  delinquent  date  on  the  CT-SUPPORT  record  (710).  This  date overrides  the current  Julian  date in determining  delinquency.  Allows  you to enter a date greater  than  the  current  date to use  in  determining  the  delinquency.          Note:  If  the override  date  is  used,  reset  the  date  to  zeros  before  processing  the  next  Delinq ue nt Document  Listing.  Do  this  by  retrieving  screen  503  by  keying  in  /503  and  pressing <ENTER>.  After  the  screen  is  displayed  with  the  date currently  stored on  the  system, cursor to the Action  Code field,  enter a D, and press <ENTER>.  This  will  reset the date stored on the  database to zeros, which  will  force  the delinquent  document  listing  to use the  current  machine  date for determining  delinquency. 5.5.20.5.  Building  the  DDL.  The  DDL  contains  data from  the  DCR,  the  DSD record, and  the  item  record.  The  DDL  program  selects  all  DSD  records  for  printing.  It  scans the  DCRs  and  compares  the  transaction  date  from  the  transaction  date/serial  number field  to  the  current  Julian  date  or  override  date  to  determine  the  number  of  day’s difference.  The  program  compares  this  difference to  the  applicable  TRIC  and delinquent/pre-delinquent  days  on the  CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC  record, and validates the  function  number  and OPR with  the CT-DELINQUENT-OPR  record. 5.5.20.6.  Printing  the DDL.  All  the DSD records and the selected  DCRs are sorted and printed  as a two-part listing.  Each  part of  the two-part listing  is divided  into  delinque nt and pre-delinquent  sections.  Users  may  print  the  delinquent  or pre-delinquent  section, 760 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 or  both  sections.  Note:    Recommend  both  delinquent  and  pre-delinquent  sections always  be printed. 5.5.20.6.1.  Line  numbers.  The  program  assigns  a sequential  line  number  to  each printed  record.   The  line  number  assigned  to a record  stays  the  same  in  both  part one and part two of the  listing.  This  assigned  number  is  only  good for  the run  being processed.  The  number  can  change  when  the  next  listing  processes  if  updates occurred  to the  DCR or DSD database records. 5.5.20.6.2.  Part  One.  Part  one  of  the  listing  is  Document  Control's  copy  of  the DDL.  Part one  lists  all  delinquent  and  pre-delinquent  documents.  A control  break occurs  on the  change  of system  designator  and  type of  listing.  A summary  total  of TRICs,  the  Julian  date  used  to  determine  delinquency,  and  the  Delinquent  TRIC Table  print  on the completion  of  each control  break. Part one is sorted  as follows: 5.5.20.6.2.1.  System  designator,  major  sort. 5.5.20.6.2.2.  Type  listing  (delinquent/pre-delinquent),  first  intermediate  sort. 5.5.20.6.2.3.  TRIC,  second intermediate  sort. 5.5.20.6.2.4.  Document  number,  minor  sort. 5.5.20.6.3.  Part Two. Part two of the DDL goes to the individual  sections/eleme nts or offices  within  the  SBSS. Control  breaks  occur  on change  of  system  designator, first;  on function  number,  second;  and on type  of listing,  third.  Part two is sorted as follows: 5.5.20.6.3.1.  System  designator,  major  sort. 5.5.20.6.3.2.  Function  number,  first  intermediate  sort  (The  function  number  is the  output  terminal  number  from  the DCR and DSD). 5.5.20.6.3.3.  Type  listing  (delinquent/pre-delinquent),  second  intermed iate sort. 5.5.20.6.3.4.  TRIC. 5.5.20.6.3.5.  Document  number. 5.5.20.7.  Distribution.  Distribute  copies  of  the DDL  to the  following  four  agencies  as well  as to other  agencies  local  management  has  chosen:   Materiel  Management  Flight and  Deployment  and  Distribution  Flight.;  Flights  use  the  listing to  speed  up  the completion  and return  of  delinquent  documents.  A copy  of  part one  of  the  DDL  goes to Document  Control;  applicable  elements  of  part two go to the individual  functions. 5.5.20.8.  Annotation.  Mark  Document  Control's  copy  of  the  DDL  to  show  the documents  still  being  processed and  the  flight  responsible.  Update  the  OPR by  using the  Document  Control  Menu  and  the  Read  Change  Work File  program.  Methods  for clearing  delinquent  documents  depends  on local  requirements.  For example,  you  may visit  each flight  monitor  or hold  daily  delinquent  document  meetings. 5.5.20.9.  Destruction  of  the  Delinquent  Listing.  You  may  destroy  the  Document Control  copy of the delinquent  listing  after  you  have  annotated  the next  day's run  of the listing. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 761 5.5.21.

Item  Record  Preparation  for  Record Reversal 5.6.1.3.1.  Assign  freeze  code  “Q”  to item  records  requiring  record  reversal  if  one  is not currently  assigned  use TRIC Freeze Code Load/Delete  (FFC).  This  action  prevents further transaction  processing  against  the  item  record  during  research  for  record reversal.   Record reversal  processing  can be accomplished  with  freeze  codes “Q, I, and C.”   All  other  freeze  codes will  need  to be  cleared  before  attempting  record  reversal processing.   Interchangeables  and Substitutes  (ISG)  may  also  be require  to be frozen. 5.6.1.3.2.  Print  a copy of the freeze  code load notice  and attach  it to the reversal  record source  document  and forward  to the  applicable  office  performing  the record reversal. 5.6.1.3.3.  Successful  reversal  record processing  will  automatically  release  freeze  code “Q”  except  for  Due-Out  Releases  (DOR’s).   An  I105 MGT  notice  (RVP Freeze  Code Q Removed  From I/R Input  Stock Number)  is output  on the Document  Control  termina l or RPS/main  system  to advise  Document  Control  of the  removal  of the  freeze  code.  If the input  is to reverse  TRIC DOR, an additional  record reversal  of TRIC Receipt  (REC) or Turn  In  (TIN)  is  not  required,  then  upon  record successful  record  reversal  process FFC to remove  the freeze  code “Q.”   This  is required  because DOR record reversal  will not remove  freeze  code “Q”  automatically. 5.6.1.3.4.  If a freeze  code “Q”  is loaded on an item  record in  error, or through  research it  is  determined  a record  reversal  is  not  required,  the  freeze  code “Q”  must  be deleted using  TRIC FFC. 5.6.1.4.

Detail  Records.    If  the  transaction  affects  in-use,  supply  point,  Special Purpose  Recoverable  Asset  Maintenance  (SPRAM),  War  Reserve  Material  (WRM), Mission  Support  Kit (MSK),  Readiness  Spares Packages (RSP) or In-Place  Readiness Spares Package (IRSP)  details,  make  sure that  authorized  detail  records are loaded  for the  document  number  being  reversed.    In  addition,  load  any  sub-details  that  were previously  deleted.  The reverse record program  will  increase  or decrease detail  records when  required.    If  you  process  a record  reversal  for  a detail  record,  and  the  on-hand quantity  becomes  zero,  the  computer  will  not  delete  the  record  if  the  authorized quantity  is one or more.  When the on-hand  quantity  is  reduced to zero, and if  the detail record  contains  part  number  or  supplementary  data,  the  computer  will  NOT  delete substitute  supply  point  detail  records. 766 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.6.1.5.2.  If  the  transaction  affects  Due-in  from  Maintenance  (DIFM)  unserviceab le detail  records,  record  reversal  programs  will  add,  increase,  delete,  or  decrease  these detail  records as required.   The unserviceable  detail  is built  by the record reversal  input.   No  prior  load  of  the  detail   For  TIN/REC  transactions,  a  DIFM unserviceable  detail  record must  be loaded  for the  document  number  (positions  67-80) being  reversed. is  required. 5.6.1.6.  Record Reversal  Pricing 5.6.1.6.1.  Material  Support  Division  (MSD)  prices  will  appear  on  the  transaction history.   You  must  input  all  prices  for  each TTPC,  if  applicable,  on the  reversal  record input  for  proper  Accounting  and  Finance  updates  to  the  General  Ledger  Account (GLA). 5.6.1.7.  Moving  Average  Cost (MAC) 5.6.1.7.1.  The  Moving  Average  Cost  (MAC)  is  required  on  all  reversal  record transactions  for budget  code 9 assets.  If the input  results  in  a 373 reject, enter  the MAC (901-FILLER-5)  on  the  CTH  from  the  original  transaction  in  the  MAC  field  on  the Reversal  Record screen and reprocess the input.   If  you are processing  a record reversal transaction  that  occurred  before  the Inventory  Valuation  updates were implemented  (1 Oct 00) then  enter  zeros  in  the  MAC field.      Note:  Failure  to input  prices  will  result in  erroneous  updates to the GLA. 5.6.2.  Issue/MSI Record Reversal. 5.6.2.1.  Purpose.   To establish  the  format  for  issue  (ISU)  and MSI record reversal  (RVP) inputs.   All  data  for  RVP  ISU  are obtained  from  the  transaction  which  updated  the  item record  balance. the  transaction  which decreased/deleted  the  MRSP/IRSP/MSK/SPRAM/DIFM  detail  that  property  was  issued from.

Budget  code  8  ERRC  XD  1PUs  will  not  be reversed  as stand-alone  transactions.  You  must  reverse  the  original  transaction(s)  that created the  1PU. 5.6.7.1.1.  Granting  Authority  for  1PU  reversal.  In  all  direct  charge  reverse-post actions  generated  by the LRS activity,  the LRS acts as the authorized  representative of  the  SMAG.  The  LRS  Activity  has the  responsibility  of  allowing  a reversal  if  it is  in  the best interest  of the SMAG and the  Air  Force using  the valid  conditions  for 1PU  record  reversal  as  a  guide.  NOTE:  When  the  AFMC  activity  generates  an invalid  1PU, the authorizing  activity  is  the  AFMC SMAG Activity. 5.6.7.1.2.  Obligated  Due-Outs  with  prior  year date of obligation.  If  prior  year due-outs  were  de-obligated  at  time  of  DOC, then  there  will  be  no  1PU transaction  to reverse  and there  is  no other  action  that  will  restore prior  year funds. 5.6.7.1.3.  Conditions  for  Reverse-Posting.  When  customers  cancel  obligated  due-outs,  they  may  incur  expenses.  These  expenses  are  referred  to  as direct  charges. Sometimes  these direct  charges  can be reverse-posted  if  certain  conditions  are met. The  LRS  SMAG  liaison/customer  service  activity  must  request  in  writing  that Document  Control  initiate  the reversal  procedure.  The  written  request  will  contain an explanation  of why  the reversal  action  is requested,  citing  the circumstances  that created  the  problem.  Document  control  will  file  the  request  with  the  reversal document.  Some  valid  circumstances  for  requesting  a reverse-post  are:  Incorrect input  of a cancellation/quantity/unit  of issue  or other  error by LRS/supply  activit y. Incorrect  cancellation  by the  customer,  when  the  due-out  can  be re-established  or AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 787 an issue  can be accomplished  without  penalty  to the  SMAG. 5.6.7.2.  Input  Restrictions.  RPS/main  system  or satellite  terminal.  Restricted  by user-ID in  appropriate  IT system. 5.6.7.2.1.

After  identifying  a transaction  that  needs to be reversed,  the first  step in  processing  is  to  get  inquiries  of  the  transaction  history  records.  If  the  transactions  are not in  the CTH database, automated  RVP procedures  will  not work.  If the  transaction  is  in the  daily  transaction  history  (901)  record  area,  regular  RVP  procedures  apply.   The  next step is  open the  INQRVP on  the  applicable  IT  system.   Fill  in  the  TTPC,  date, and  serial number  of  the  transaction  to  process  (see  Table  5.224.).    Then  program  665  does  the following: 5.6.8.3.  Edits  the 1AM input  screen  for  a valid  TTPC and date/serial  number. 5.6.8.4.  Retrieves  the  CTH  record  from  the  database  and  determines  if  the  TTPC  on  the CTH record matches  the  input. 5.6.8.5.  Edits  the record to ensure  the TRIC  and TTPC are authorized  for  record reversal. 5.6.8.6.  Formats  a record  reversal  image  on  the  appropriate  RVP  screen  (see  Para  5.6.2 through   5.6.7). AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 789 Table 5.227.  INQRVP Input  Screen. Pos.  No Pos.

Records Reversal Internal  Processing. 5.6.10.1.  Record  reversal  transaction  histories  contain  the  same  basic  data as the  origina l transaction  history  with  these  exceptions:   the date of last  transaction,  date and transaction serial  number,  and  the  type  transaction  phrase  code  (always  alpha-alpha).   The  flag  for DCC  and  transaction  register  print  is  the  same  as  the  original  transaction  history.   The computer  may  alter  the  type  transaction  phrase  code  on  the  record  reversal  transaction history  according  to the adjustments  of specific  detail  records.  For example,  if  you  reverse a  DOR  with  a  due-out  detail  TTPC  of  2A  (minus  due-out  detail),  and  the  due-out  was deleted  before  inputting  the  record reversal,  the  reversal  program  will  add a due-out  detail record and change  the  TTPC to 2C. 5.6.10.2.

Positions 30-31 will contain RC when the CIC quantity does not equal the item record inventory  balance.  This indicates recount action is required/pending.   When the IRC with RC in positions 30-31 is processed, the ILS-S compares the IRC quantity to the item record  inventory  balance.  If the quantities are unequal and the automatic adjustment criteria are not met, the system will programmatically produce  a new IRC with AR in positions 30-31 to indicate additional research is required.  Re-input of the IRC with AR in positions 30-31 will adjust the item record inventory  balance and update the applicable inventory  accuracy records. Input the detail record number  to be inventoried. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 799 4 5 For all details, enter the document  number  in positions 35-48. Position 50 will contain the materiel condition code (E, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, R, or W). 5.7.4.  Automatic  Adjustment  Criteria. 5.7.4.1.  Purpose.  To describe  the conditions  under  which  automatic  adjustments  are made when  system  inventory  balance  quantities  differ  from  inventory  recount  quantities. 5.7.4.2.  Items  Involved.   If  the  inventory  balance  and  the  computer  balance  do not  agree, the  ILS-S will  make  programmatic  adjustments  to reconcile  the  item  record balance  with the  recount  quantity  for  certain  serviceable  items.    These  automatic  inventory  quantity adjustments  will  be made  only  after  an  inventory  recount  is  performed  and  the  following conditions  are met: 5.7.4.2.1.  Record Balance.   The  item  record inventory  balance  does not agree with  the recount  quantity  for  type  account  code B. 5.7.4.2.2.  Adjustment  Value.   The dollar  value  for automatic  adjustment,  computed  by multiplying  the adjusted  quantity  by the  unit  price,  is within  the  following  limits: 5.7.4.2.2.1.  Pilferable  items  less  than  $100.00. 5.7.4.2.2.2.  Controlled  item  code U, unclassified  items  less  than  $1,000.00.  Note:   Items  with  controlled  item  code 7, although  considered  unclassified  for storage  and handling  purposes,  require  research  prior  to adjustment. 5.7.4.2.3.  Inventory  Recount  Output  Formats.   If  there  is  a discrepancy  between  the inventory  balance  and the  item  record inventory  balance  and the  items  do not  meet  the above criteria,  the ILS-S produces an IRC (inventory  recount  output  format).   See Para 5.7.3. for  IRC format. 5.7.4.2.4.  Documentation  of Automatic  Inventory  Balance  Adjustments. 5.7.4.2.4.1.  AUTO-COMPL.    The  phrase  AUTO-COMPL  identifies  automatic adjustments  on both  the  transaction  register  (stock  number  requested  field)  (print -punch  flag  contains  A)  and  the  consolidated inventory  adjustment  document register. 5.7.5.  Special Inventory  Interrogation  Input  (1GP). 5.7.5.1.  Purpose.   To assign  freeze  code I, produce  inventory  recount  outputs  (IRCs)  and produce  a  special  inventory  count  output  notice  (see  Para  5.7.6.)  containing  the  asset, detail,  and  history  information  pertinent  to  the  type  of  inventory  count  requested.

To describe  the  processing  of  condition  changes,  the  condition  change (FCC) input  format  and the condition  change  output  document. 5.9.2.2.  Recording  Condition  Changes.  Inspection  personnel  record condition  changes  on the  item  record by processing  a condition  change  (FCC) input.  The  FCC input  records the change  by  reducing  the  item  record  serviceable  balance  and  creating  an  unserviceab le detail  record or vice  versa.  An  FCC input  will  also  change  the unserviceable  condition  on an unserviceable  detail.   For example,  supply  condition  code J (suspended  in  stock) can be changed  to  supply  condition  code  H  (condemned).  The  unserviceable  detail  document number  will  not change  when  unserviceable  supply  condition  codes are changed  from  one to  another.  Inspection  personnel  will  also  be  prompted  to  scan/enter  Unique  Item Identification  (UII)s  for  assets  identified  as  Item  Unique  Identification  (IUID)  managed assets.    If  UII  is  unavailable,  submit  transaction  through  the  ILS-S  system.    Inspection personnel  notify  Stock Control  of all  changes  to the unserviceable  balance  field,  except  for those  increases  when  program  control  makes  immediate  disposition. 822 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.9.2.3.

Processing Identity  Changes. 5.9.3.1.  Purpose:    To  describe  the  processing  of  identity  changes,  the  Identify  Change input  (FCH) format  and the  Identity  Change  (FCH) Document  output  format. 5.9.3.2.  Processing  FCH Inputs.   Identity  change  inputs  (FCH)  are processed  for  ONLY the  following  purposes: 5.9.3.2.1.  To  correct  errors  of  identification  for  serviceable  items  in  storage.   When Storage  and Issue  personnel  find  incorrectly  identified  serviceable  items  in  stock, they ask Inspection  personnel  to identify  the materiel.   If  the  identity  error is  the  result  of a manufacturer’s the manufacturer  put  the  wrong  part  number  on  an  item  and  the  part  number  cross-references  to an AM radio,  but the  item  itself  is  an FM radio. identification  error  an  FCH  is  authorized.   For  example, AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 831 5.9.3.2.2.  To transfer  overflow  adjunct  record balances  between  two records (basic and -9) and to transfer  supplemental  adjunct  balances  between  the  two records (basic  and -1/-2).  Inspection  personnel  create and process these inputs  with  the advice  and consent of Stock Control. 5.9.3.2.3.  To re-identify  tires  being  recapped with  a different  tread. inventory  must  be  requested  for  all  other  discrepancies 5.9.3.2.4.  A  special in identification,  see  Para  5.7.5  for  details.    Inventory  personnel  research  transaction histories,  and,  if  possible,  initiate  reverse-post  procedures  to  correct  the  discrepancy.   If  research  shows  reverse-posting  is  not possible,  inventory  adjustments  (IRC)  will  be used to correct the  discrepancy. 5.9.3.2.5.  Weapons  or  CCI/COMSEC  Items.    The  identity  change  of  a  Weapon  or CCI/COMSEC asset will  NOT be allowed.   A 618 reject  will  occur when  the  From  or To stock number’s  serialized  report  code is equal  to an "A"  or "C". 5.9.3.3.  Adjusting  the  Inventory  Record.   Each  identity  change  transaction  creates  both  a decrease  and  an  increase  inventory  adjustment  record.    These  adjustments  appear  as separate  entities  on  the  Consolidated  Inventory  Adjustment  Document  Register.    The certification  and approval  of identity  change  adjustments  are outlined  in  Para 5.9.5.  Note:   The  transfer  of  assets  from  or  to  an  adjunct  record  does  NOT  update  the  Inventory Accuracy  Records. 5.9.3.4.  Correcting  Discrepancies  in  Identification  of  Items  on  Details.   When  possible, Inspection  personnel  use  reverse-posting  to  correct  the  identification  of  items  on  detail records.   When  it  is  not  possible  to use  reverse-post  procedures,  or when  the  discrepancy results  from  a manufacturer's  error,  use the following  guidelines  to change  the  identity: 5.9.3.4.1.  To correctly  identify  items  recorded on in-use  detail  records, use FER inputs (see Para  5.4.4 for details). 5.9.3.4.2.  To  change  the  identity  of  items  recorded  on  DIFM  (FIRM),  supply  point, WRM, or REM  detail  records, use the  following  procedures: 5.9.3.4.2.1.  Process a TIN input  for the  quantity  misidentified,  using  TEX  code 8. 5.9.3.4.2.2.  Process  an  FIL  to  load  the  item  record  for  the  change-to  stock number/system  designator,  if  it  is  not already  loaded. 5.9.3.4.2.3.  Process an  FCH input  for  the  misidentified  quantity,  using  TEX  code 8. 5.9.3.4.2.4.  Process a detail  record load  input,  if  necessary. 5.9.3.4.2.5.  Process  an  ISU  for  the  reidentified  quantity,  unless  the  property  has been returned  to warehouse  storage. 5.9.3.4.3.  To  change  the  identity  of  items  on  unserviceable  detail  records,  use  the following  procedures: 5.9.3.4.3.1.  Process an FCC to return  the item  to serviceable  condition.   (Use TEX 8 to suppress  DOR.) 5.9.3.4.3.2.  Process an FCH to reidentify  the item.   (Use TEX  8 to suppress  DOR.)  832 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.9.3.4.3.3.  Process an FCC to return  the  item  to unserviceable  condition. 5.9.3.5.  Identify  Change  Input  (FCH).  The  identity  change  input  (FCH) is  used to change the  recorded identity  of  an item  by transferring  assets from  one item  record to another. 5.9.3.5.1.  Input  Format  and  Entry  Requirements.   The  identify  change  input  (FCH) may  be input  using  screens  FCH and  FCHSAT,  at  any  terminal  based upon  the  user-ID/password.

Once the basic stock number  has been entered, program  control transfers the required  quantity from the (-9) record when appropriate. Decimal Locator, Conversion Factor, and Change to Quantity. Leave the Change To Quantity field blank.  The Change To Quantity will be computed  as follows. a.  When  the  Change  From Stock Number  and  the Change To Stock Number  have  the same  unit  of  issue,  the Change From  Quantity  will  be the Change  To Quantity. b.  When the Change From  Stock Number  and the Change To Stock Number  have different units of issue the system will compute  the Change To Quantity based on the standard unit of issue conversion table.  If the unit of issue is not in the standard unit of issue conversion table then the conversion factor must be entered in positions 46-49.    Note:   Reject 053 (Conversion Factor Invalid) will occur if program  control cannot internally perform  the conversion (for example, if the results of the internal conversion do not equal a complete unit of issue).

Enter the required data.  If the item is a weapon, forward  one copy to Document Control, otherwise forward one copy to Contract Maintenance. 5.9.3.6.3.  Authentication  of Identity  Changes.   Identity  Changes  must  be certified  and approved  by  the  appropriate  officials  as  indicated  in  Para  5.9.5.    The  appropriate officials  sign  the  signature  page of  the  Consolidated  Inventory  Adjustment  Document   (IAD)  Register  to certify  and approve  identity  changes.   See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 3, Ch 3 for more  information  concerning  the  Consolidated  IAD Register  report. 5.9.4.  Processing Warehouse Change  Documents. 5.9.4.1.  Purpose.  To describe generation  and  processing  of warehouse  change  documents.  5.9.4.2.  Warehouse  Change  Documents.   Certain  Materiel  Management   transactions  will automatically  cause the generation  of warehouse  change  documents.   Transactions  that  will cause  the automatic  generation  of a warehouse  change  document  are: AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 839 5.9.4.2.1.  Item Record Indicative  Data Changes  (FIC).  When an item  record indicat ive data changes  (FIC) input  changes  a stock number,  system  designator,  or ERRCD.   See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 8. for the  output  format.   A warehouse  change  document will  NOT be produced  when  the  FIC input  changes  only  the  last  two  positions  of  the national  stock  number  (positions  14-15).    It  is,  therefore,  NOT  necessary  to  keep positions  14-15 of  the  national  stock number  current  on  external  tags,  bin  labels,  etc.  The  13-digit  national  stock number  is the  basis  for Materiel  Management   transactions on these  items. 5.9.4.2.2.  FCU Inputs.   When  an FCU input  changes  the unit  of issue.   (See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for  the output  format.) 5.9.4.2.3.  1SC Input.   When  a 1SC input  changes  a controlled  item  code.  (See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for  the  output  format.) 5.9.4.3.  Receipt  of  Warehouse  Change  Documents.   Warehouse  personnel  must  process warehouse  change  documents  as quickly  as possible.   Upon  receipt  of  warehouse  change documents,  warehouse  personnel  will  do the  following: 5.9.4.3.1.  Update  labels,  tags,  and  listings.   Change  the  applicable  data on  bin  labels, property  tags,  locator  listing  (Stock Number  Directory),  etc. 5.9.4.3.1.1.  Shelf  Life  and Issue Exception  Code Changes.   Program  control  prints the  shelf  life  code and  issue  exception  code in  line  one,  print  positions  79 and  80 respectively  on  all  FIC warehouse  change  notices.    When  applicable,  warehouse personnel  use  these data to update external  files. 5.9.4.3.1.2.  Zero Balance  Procedures.  When  a unit  of issue  change  results  in  a zero balance  because there  is an insufficient  quantity  on hand  to show a balance, warehouse  personnel  must  get AFMC to help resolve  the problem.  For example, if  the  item  is  critical  or in  short  supply  locally,  local  management  must  decide if  adjunct  (-1) records should  be loaded. 5.9.4.3.2.  Relocate  property,  if  necessary.    Relocation  may  be  necessary  when  the following  occur: the  warehouse  change  document.   item  code  changes  by  signing 5.9.4.3.2.1.  Controlled  item  code  is  changed.    The  Materiel  Management  Flight Commander  or Superintendent  must  approve any  relocation  of the  property  caused by  controlled When  changing  from  classified  to  unclassified,  warehouse  personnel  must  verify the change  to the controlled  item  code originated  through  the SNUD.  If the change did  not  originate  through  SNUD,  warehouse  personnel  process  a  1SC  input  to reinstate  the previous  (FROM) controlled  item  code stated on the warehouse  change document.   If the change  was received  through  SNUD, it should  be valid.   However, if  the  Materiel  Management  Flight  Commander  or  Superintendent  believes  the change  compromises  security,  warehouse  personnel immediately  ask  Records Maintenance  to validate  the  controlled  item  codes.  In  the  meantime,  the  property remains  in  secure  storage. 5.9.4.3.2.2.  Stock numbers  are consolidated. 840 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.9.4.3.3.  Coordinate  with  Inspection.    Coordinate  with  Inspection  when  property requires  inspection. 5.9.4.3.4.  DD 1348-1A.  Initial  and date block 27 of the DD 1348-1A and then  forward the  original  to Document  Control. 5.9.4.4.  Daily  Document  Register.   The  Daily  Document  Register  contains  entries  for  1) FID inputs  that  recorded a warehouse  location  on the deleted item  record, and 2) FCU, FIC, and 1SC inputs  that recorded an unserviceable  detail  record for an item.   (See AFH 23-123, Vol  2, Pt 3, Ch 14 for  the  formats  of  transaction  histories.)   Warehouse  storage  personnel process the  Daily  Document  Register  as described  below  and  then  destroy  it.   Should  any subsequent  research  be  necessary,  use  the  Daily  Document  Register  maintained  by Document  Control.   Note:   The  LRS/Accountable  Officer  signature  is  not  needed  on  the portion  of  Daily  Document  Register  processed by warehouse  storage  personnel. 5.9.4.4.1.  FID  Entries  on  the  Daily  Document  Register.    FID  entries  on  the  Daily Document  Register  are  arranged  sequentially  by  location  (as  stated  in  the  document number  field).   Storage and  Issue personnel  must  verify  all  locations. 5.9.4.4.1.1.  If  the  location  is  empty,  remove  or obliterate  the  bin  label  and  cross-out the  corresponding  entry  on the  locator  listing. 5.9.4.4.1.2.  If  the  location  contains  property,  prepare  a  request  for  special inventory  and  forward  it  to  Inventory.   Enter  the  location  of  the  property  on  the request  for special  inventory  but DO NOT cross out the corresponding  entry  on the locator  listing  (although  this  may  be annotated  to indicate  that  the  item  record was deleted). 5.9.4.4.2.  FCU,  FIC,  and  1SC  Entries  on  the  Daily  Document  Register.   The  FCU, FIC,  and  1SC  entries  on  the  Daily  Document  Register  indicate  warehouse  change documents  for  unserviceable  assets.    They  are  arranged  sequentially  by  document number,  which  will  have  activity  code R, organization  code 920, and shop code RW in its  first  seven  positions.    The  FIC entries  indicate  changes  to  stock  number,  system designators,  and/or ERRCD.   The  1SC entries  indicate  changes  to controlled  item  code, and the  FCU entries  indicate  changes  to unit  of issue. 5.9.5.  Authentication  of Inventory  Adjustments  and  Identity  Changes. 5.9.5.1.  Purpose.    To  identify  certification  and  approval  signature  requirements  for inventory  adjustments  and identity  changes. Table 5.267.

Overview.   This  chapter  outlines  reference  information  for  materiel  management  processes associated  with  materiel  returns  and  disposal  of  materiel.   These  processes  include  Returns, Disposal  and the  Precious  Metals  Recovery  Program  (PMRP).   Additional  materiel  manageme nt guidance  on these  processes can be found  in  AFI 23-101 and in  AFMAN 23-122. Section 6B—Returns (Turn-ins) 6.2.  Returns (Turn-ins). 6.2.1.  Recoverable Item Turn-In  Request (TIN). 6.2.1.1.  Purpose. This  section  provides  the  format  for  processing  recoverable  item  returns (turn-ins)  to the  ILS-S.  The  section  is  provided  in  two  parts.  Table  6.1 is  the  input  TIN transaction  format  for  processing  recoverable  item  returns.  Table  6.2 provides  additiona l instruction  detailing  the mark-for  field  of the  TIN transaction.   Personnel  processing  turn-in  transactions  will  also  be  prompted  to  scan/enter  Unique  Item  Identification  (UII)s  for assets  identified  as  Item  Unique  Identification (IUID)  managed  assets.    If  UII  is unavailable,  submit  transaction  through  the  ILS-S system. Table 6.1.  Input  Format  and  Entry  Requirements. Normally,  but  not  limited  to, Screen TINMAINT/#096 INQDND/#433.

If the  input  is through  the RPS/main  system,  and if  line  2 contains  action  phrase  BIN XXXXX  IN LOCATION XXXXXXXXXX,  or if  the input  is  rejected, the tote box/hold bay will  appear in  positions  57-59 of the  output  DD  1348-1A. b.  If it  is  not practical  to assign  a tote box/hold  bay before computer  processing, establish  local  procedures  for controlling  these assets. 2.  Disposal  authority  or shipment  exception  (SEX) code (position  7).  This  is a multiple purpose field  used with  other entries  to direct  or modify  process. a.  When  position  62 contains  action  taken  code 9 or positions  48-50 contain  TRM,  the applicable  disposal  authority  code G or H will  be entered. If  this  field  is  left  blank,  the appropriate  disposal  authority  code will  be assigned  by the  program. b.  If the  item  is  not condemned,  leave  the  field  blank  or enter  a shipment  exception  code. When  the  item  record contains  shipment  exception  code 1, 2, or 3 and automatic shipment  is  desired,  the same  code must  be entered. 3.  Quantity  (positions  25-29).  This  field  must  be numeric  values  other  than  all  zeros. a.  When  turn-ins  do not  affect  detail  records, a quantity  greater  than  9 cannot  be used unless  TEX  code 5 is  entered in  position  51. b.  Turn-ins  that affect  detail  records may  exceed the  reasonable  quantity  edit,  but cannot exceed the  on-hand  balance  in  the detail  record. 4.  Document  number  (positions  30-43).  Turn-ins  that  affect  detail  records, such  as DIFM, WRM, contract  maintenance,  and Supply  Point,  must  contain  the same  document number  as used on the  original  issue  request or due-out  release. 5.  Supplementary  Data (positions  45-50).  This  is  a multiple  purpose field  which  will  be completed  or left  blank,  based on the following: a.  When  the  item  is  being  processed for manual  shipment  or force  shipment,  the  ship-to stock record account  number  must  be entered. b.  When  property  is  being  turned-in  from  an activity  assigned  type  organization  code A or B (Civil  Engineer),  a CE work order number  must  be entered. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 845 c.  When the property  has been condemned by an inspector, positions 45-47 will be left blank and TRM will be entered in positions 48-50. d.  For turn-ins that process against a Vehicle Maintenance organization, a vehicle maintenance work order  number  and change code must be entered. 6.  Transaction Exception (TEX) Code (position 51).  TEX code authorization  is as follows: a.  TEX codes 2 and 4 are only authorized for exception processing (MICAP releases and lateral support requirements) but are not intended to override normal release sequencing. b.  The use of TEX codes to bypass DIFM details is not authorized when the input  demand code is C, J, K, L, M, or I.  Do not use TEX code 7 for NWRM turn-ins. c.  TEX Code 8.  When an item has been issued manually, the TIN input must contain  TEX code 8 in position 51 and the ISU input must immediately follow the TIN input. d.  TEX code Y automatically builds and processes an input to  delete a prime detail  record when the turn-in results in zero quantity on hand.  (For a list of these details, see AFH 23-123, Vol, 2 Pt 2, Ch 3, TEX Y.[xxx]) 7.  Interchangeability code (position 54).  Enter interchangeability code I when the  inspector has determined the item being turned  in is acceptable for the item issued, but  should not be linked in the applicable ISG.  This code causes the turn-in to process and  clear DIFM detail records.  Extreme care must be taken when processing a turn-in  of a DIFM item with interchangeability code I.  If the input is processed in error  and requires  reverse-post action, the RVPTIN program, NGV654, will establish the DIFM detail  under the stock number  turned  in, NOT the stock number  on the original DIFM detail. 8.  Project code (positions 57-59).  This code may be used for turn-in against specific DoD or Air Force projects. a.  For items originally issued for calibration, or repair and return  (RAR), the turn-in  must contain the applicable RAR project code. b.  For SMAG items, PFMR codes will appear in transaction history records instead of  input project codes. 9.  Shipment priority  (positions 60-61).  This field makes it possible to assign shipment priority codes higher than would normally be assigned to any shipment. 10. Action taken codes (position 62).  See Table 4.3 for complete details on action taken codes. a.  Activity code C inputs must  contain maintenance action codes for all repair cycle  items. b.  Activity code D inputs must contain action taken codes.  The repair cycle record will  be updated as follows:  1) unserviceable TIN will reflect four days RCT; 2) serviceable  TIN for ERRCD XD1 will reflect six days RCT; and 3) serviceable TIN for ERRCD XD2, or XF3 will reflect nine days RCT. Activity code R, S, J, and X inputs will contain action codes when DIFM detail  records are affected 846 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 d. All other  inputs for repair cycle items will contain action codes if repair cycle data are to be updated.  Action taken codes will also be used when repair cycle data are not affected (for example, items issued with demand code C). e. Deficiency Report exhibits require action taken code C. f. Serviceable returns  from Supply Points, MSK/MRSP  details, and all categories of WRM will contain action taken code T. 11. Demand code (position 66).  Leave this field blank on all turn-ins with the following exceptions: a. Turn-in of a repair cycle item that is not controlled on WRM, MSK, MRSP, Supply Point, SPRAM, or DIFM details must reflect the demand  code of the original issue request; e.g., initial issue demand code I. b. Turn-in for SPRAM activity code D will result in a 259 reject unless it contains demand  code I (when reducing or deleting authorized  detail) or demand code R (when requesting replacement item). c. Leave blank when TEX codes A, B, D, F, H, or + are used. Demand code N is automatically assigned to inputs containing these TEX codes. 12. Enter manual input or hour  code as follows: a. When an item is physically turned in to supply and processing of the TIN is delayed for more than 1 duty day, enter a P in position 53 and the last three positions of the Julian date (actual turn-in date) in positions 4-6 of the TIN input.  This will ensure that repair cycle data are updated based on the actual turn-in date rather than the current  computer  processing date.  This procedure  applies regardless of the reason for delay (that is, Degraded O perations, reject conditions, frozen  item record, etc.). b. If the input is done manually (TEX 4 or D) or if position 53 contains a P, enter the last three positions of the Julian date (turn-in  and/or DOR date) in positions 4-6. This date is the due-out release date and/or MICAP termination  date. c. If the due-out  UND is 1, /, or J (MICAP), enter the one-position hour code in position 7.  (See Para 5.2.26 for the hour code table). 13. If the item being turned  in is an unserviceable reliability improvement  warranty (RIW) item (Pacer Warrant, Project code 390), then enter the following: a. Disposal authority or SEX code (position 7).  Leave position 7 blank. b. Quantity (positions 25-29). The quantity cannot be greater than 1. c. Supplementary  data (positions 45-50).  Leave position 45 blank.  Positions 46-50 must contain the item's serial number.  (When the item serial number  exceeds five positions, enter the last five alpha-numeric characters of the serial number d. Transaction exception (TEX) code (position 51). The TEX code must be 1, 6, +, A, F, or blank.  Use TEX code 1 only when directed to do so by the IM or the RIW monitor  at AFMC. e. Action taken code (position 62).  The action taken code must be 1-8. See Table 4.3 for complete details on action taken codes. 14. Credit code (position 52).  Normally left blank.  Credit codes make it possible to override internal edits when a customer applies for credit returns.  The LRS/LGL must approve the use of credit code Y on the AF Form  2005 before processing. 15. Supply condition code (position 44). Supply condition  codes A and D for serviceable items, and E, F, G, or H for unserviceable (to include unserviceable reliability improvement  warranty AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 847 (RIW) Pacer Warrant, Project code 390 deficiencies) items. For unserviceable Deficiency Report, use supply condition code Q. For unserviceable FSG 3110 routing identifier code S9I or SMS items, use supply condition code E. (Both codes D and H will result in an unserviceable detail being added to the computer  file, but when supply condition code H is used, the maintenance action taken code must be 9.) 16. Last three positions of the work  unit code (positions 63-65). When the TIN is for RAMPS (Report Code F, G, 6, or 7) investment items (XD) action taken code 1-9 and type organization code G, V, 7, 8, 9, or I, positions 63-65 must contain the last three positions of the work unit code. 17. Controlled Item Code (position 81).  If data classification code is left blank, normal processing will take place.  Use this code for a Turn  in of unclassified property which has classified data but cannot be removed  for mechanical reasons.  If the data classification code is entered in position 81 of the TIN and a shipment is expected to be output,  a hand receipt will be output.  The authorized  data classification codes (controlled item code) are:  A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L O, S, and T. 18. JOCAS (Job Order Cost Accounting System) Control Number  (positions 82 - 93).  If the organization’s control record  JOCAS Flag is set to a Y (turned  on), then a JOCAS control  number must be entered. 19. Supply Condition Code (position 44). When the DIFM detail (Disposition- Response-Code) contains an S or 3 (dispose), and a TIN is processed with condition- code F the condition-code will be changed to H.  If the DIFM detail (Disposition- Response-Code) contains a G (evacuate), and a TIN is processed with condition-code  F the condition-code  will be changed to G.  These edits will occur programmatically, however  in order  to store a response code G in the DIFM detail, the following must occur: a. The disposition-response code of the requested AWP end-item DIFM detail will be updated with an E (confirmed evacuation) on an XE9 input. b. Cancel the related credit DIFM AWP due-out, and the ILS-S will programmatically  change the response code E to response code G on the XE9. 6.2.1.2.

Tote Box/Hold  Bay  (positions  4-6). Data entered  in  this  field  will  be printed  in  the  warehouse location  field.  a. If  the input  is  through  the RPS/main  system,  and if  line  2 contains  action  phrase  BIN XXXXX IN LOCATION XXXXXXXXXX,  or if  the  input  is  rejected, the  tote box/hold  bay will  appear in positions  57-59 of  the output  DD 1348-1A. b. If  it  is not  practical  to assign  a tote box/hold  bay before  computer  processing,  establish  local procedures  for  controlling  these  assets. 2. Disposal  authority  or shipment  exception  (SEX)  code (position  7).  This  is  a multiple  purpose field  which  is  used with  other  entries  to direct  or modify  processing. a. The  applicable  disposal  authority  code G, H, or blank  will  be entered  when  positions  48-50 contain  TRM  or position  62 contains  action  taken  code 9. If  this  field  is  left  blank,  the appropriate disposal  authority  code will  be assigned  by the program.   (See AFH 23-123, Vol  1, Ch 2 for disposal  authority  codes.) b. When  the  item  is  not condemned,  leave  this  field  blank  or enter  the  appropriate  shipment exception  code. 3. Quantity  (positions  25-29).  This  field  must  be numeric  values  other  than  all  zeros. a. When  turn-ins  do not  affect  detail  records, the quantity  cannot  normally  exceed  999. However,  if TEX  code 5 is  entered  in  position  51, the  turn-in  quantity  may  be up to 99,999. b. Turn-ins  that  affect  detail  records may  exceed the  reasonable  quantity  edit,  but cannot  exceed the on-hand  balance  in  the detail  record. 4.  Document  number  (positions  30-43).  Turn-ins  that  affect  detail  records, such  as WRM, must contain  the  same  document  number  as used on the  original  issue  request  or due-out  release. 5. Supplementary  data (positions  45-50).  This  is  a multiple  purpose  field  which  will  be completed or left  blank,  based on the following: a. Enter  the ship-to  stock record account  number  when  the item  is  being  processed for  a manual shipment  or force  shipment. b. Enter  a Civil  Engineer  work order number  when  property  is  being  turned  in  from  an activity assigned  type  organization  code A or B (Civil  Engineer). c. Enter  TRM in  positions  48-50 when  the property  has been condemned  by a LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  inspector.   Positions  45-47 will  be left  blank. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 851 d. Enter  a vehicle  maintenance  work order number  and  change  code for  those  turn-ins  that process against  a vehicle  maintenance  organization. 6. Project code (positions  57-59). Use this  code for turn-in  against  specific  DoD or Air  Force projects.   Turn-in  of items  which  were originally  issued  for  calibration,  RAR  must  contain  the RAR  project code that  applies.   PFMR codes will  appear in  the  transaction  history  records for SMAG items  instead  of  input  project codes. 7. Shipment  priority  (positions  60-61).  This  field  provides  the  capability  for assigning  shipment priority  codes higher  than  normally  would  be assigned  by the  ILS-S.  This  code will  be used on any  shipment  resulting  from  the  turn-in. 8. Action  taken code (position  62). Action  taken  code used  for turn-in  of consumable  items  will be blank  with  the  following  exceptions: a. Serviceable  turn-in  from  detail  records such  as WRM will  contain  supply  action  taken code T. b. Action  taken code U turn-ins  will  decrease the cumulative  recurring  demands  by the  quantity turned  in. c. When  the  item  turned  in  is a Deficiency  Report exhibit,  use supply  condition  code Q and action taken  code C. 9. Supplementary  data (positions  45-50) and  Project Code (positions  57-59). See Table 6.4. 10. Transaction  exception  (TEX)  code (position  51). The  use of  TEX  codes can have  the following  effects: a. TEX  codes 2, 4, A,  B, D, F, H, and + are not authorized  for returns  of expendable  supplies. b. TEX  code Y automatically  builds  and processes  an input  to delete  a prime  detail  record when the  turn-in  results  in  zero  quantity  on hand. c. Automatic  shipment.   Automatic  shipment  may  be accomplished  under  the  following conditions: c1. Enter  TEX  code 7 in  position  51 and the  ship-to  stock record account  number/DODAAC  in positions  45-50 on the  TIN input.   When  this  procedure  is used,  the shipment  program  will  assign the  shipping  document  number  and a DD 1348-1A shipping  document  will  be printed. c2. Enter  TEX  code 6 in  position  51, the  ship-to  stock record account  number  DODAAC in positions  45-50, and the  shipping  document  number  in  positions  67- 80 in  the  TIN input.   When this  procedure  is  used, a DD 1348-1A shipping  document  will  not  be printed.   This  transaction  is not authorized  for  type organization  codes 7, 8, 9, A, B, G, I, or V. d. TEX  code 1.  By  entering  TEX  code 1 in  position  51, you  can suppress  unserviceable  reporting and disposition  action. 11. Credit  code (position  52).  Normally  left  blank.   For organizational  materiel  requiring processing  to DLADS,  use  credit  code N. Credit  codes make  it  possible  to override  internal  edits when  a customer  applies  for credit  returns.   Credit  code N is  assigned  when  no credit  is  to be allowed,  regardless  of the stock position  of the  item.  Credit  code Y is  assigned  when  credit  is allowed.  The  LRS/LGL  must  approve the  use of credit  code Y on the AF Form 2005 before processing. 12. Mark-for  data (positions  67-80). See Table  6.4. 13. Controlled  Item  Code (position  81).  If  controlled  item  code is  left  blank,  normal  processing will  take place.  If  the  data classification  code is  entered  in  position  81 of the  TIN and a shipment document  is  produced, the  ILS-S will  also  produce a hand  receipt.   The  authorized  data classification  codes (controlled  item  code) are:  A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, O, S, and T. 14. Job Order Cost Accounting  System  Control  Number  (JOCAS) (positions  82- 93).  If the organization’s  control  record JOCAS Flag  is  set to a Y (turned  on), then  a JOCAS control  number must  be entered. 15. Supply  Condition  Code (position  44).  Unserviceable  turn-ins  will  be processed automatically for  transfer  to DLADS  unless  the  input  TEX  code, item  record shipment  exception  (SEX)  code or the  critical  item  reporting  code prevents  the action. 852 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 6.2.2.2.

When property  is not due-out  released, these data will appear in print positions 57-59 of line 2 on the output  management notice.  If it is not practical to assign tote box/hold  bay prior to computer  processing, establish local procedures for controlling these assets.  When processing TIN for COMSEC items, place the ship-to RID in this field. 2.  Disposal authority or shipment exception (SEX) code (position 7).  This is a multiple purpose field used with other  entries to direct or modify processing. a.  When positions 48-50 contain TRM or position 62 contains maintenance action taken code 9, enter the applicable disposal authority code, G, H, or blank.  If this field is left blank, the program  will assign the appropriate  disposal authority code.   b.  When the item is not condemned,  leave this field blank or enter the appropriate shipment exception code. 3.  Quantity (positions 25-29).  This field must be a positive value (greater than zero). a.  Turn-ins which do not affect detail records cannot contain a quantity greater than 9 for cost Category I, greater than 99 for cost Category II, or greater than 999 for cost Category III, unless TEX code 5 is entered in position 51. b.  Turn-ins that affect detail records may exceed the reasonable quantity edit, but cannot exceed the on-hand balance in the detail record. 4.  Document  number  (positions 30-43). a.  Turn-ins which affect detail records such as WRM, in-use, or contract maintenance must contain the same document  number  as used on the issue request original or due-out release.  Other supply functions will normally use the original document  number and not assign document numbers for turn-in transactions. b.  For turn-in of organizational-owned  non-EAID equipment  requiring processing to DLADS, use activity code P.  For turn-ins from retail outlets, use activity code K.  The requester provides the org/shop code (positions 31-35).  EAE enters the current  Julian date.  The custodian provides the authorized/in-use  detail document  number  (activity code E) or EAE assigns next available serial number (activity code P) in positions 40-43. 856 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 5.  Supplementary  data (positions 45-50).  This is a multiple purpose field that will be completed or left blank, based on the following: a.  When the item is being processed for manual shipment or force shipment, or when a vehicle is turned  in with vehicle status code B, G, P, S, T, or U, enter the ship-to stock record account number. b.  When property  is being turned  in from an activity assigned type organization code A or B (Civil Engineer), enter a Civil Engineer work order  number. c.  When the property  has been condemned  by a LRS/Materiel Management Activity inspector, enter TRM in  positions 48-50 and leave positions 45-47 blank. d.  When a vehicle is turned in for transfer to DLADS, enter TRM in positions 48-50 and vehicle status code M in position 75 on the input TIN. e.  For those turn-ins that process against a vehicle maintenance organization operating under the SBLC VIMS, enter a vehicle maintenance work order  number  and charge code. 6.  Authority  for Issue Flag (position 54).  When activity code P is used to turn  in an equipment  item, enter the authority for issue flag that was used on the original request for issue. 7.  Project code (positions 57-59).  Use this field for turn-in against specific DoD or Air Force projects. a.  For items originally issued for calibration, RAR, the turn-in  must contain the applicable RAR project code. b.  For SMAG items, PFMR codes will appear in the transaction history records instead of input project codes. 8.  Shipment  priority  (positions 60-61).  This field provides the capability for assigning shipment priority codes higher than normally would be computed  by the program.  Use this code on any shipment resulting from  the turn-in. 9.  Action taken code (position 62).  See Table 4.3. for the specific use of each type action taken code. a.  Serviceable turn-ins require  supply action taken code S, T, or U. b.  Unserviceable turn-ins require maintenance/supply action taken code 1 through  7, 9, or R. c.  Deficiency Report exhibits, required  maintenance action taken code C.   10.  Credit code (position 52).  Credit codes make it possible to override  internal edits when a customer applies for credit returns.  The credit code is normally left blank.  Credit code N is assigned when no credit is to be allowed, regardless of the  stock position of the item.  For turn-in of organizationally owned non-EAID equipment requiring processing to DLADS, use credit code N.  Credit code Y is assigned when credit AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 857 is allowed.  The fund’s manager must approve the use of credit code Y on the AF Form 2005 before processing 11.  Mark-for data (positions 67-80).  This is a multiple purpose field that will be used to support other  data elements and/or further  modify processing. a.  When a TEX code is used to force a due-out release or process a manual due-out release, shipment, or transfer to DLADS, enter a valid document  number. b.  For a turn-in from  an activity assigned type organization code A or B (Civil Engineer), enter the facility number  in positions 67-71 and the job order  number  in positions 76-80 when applicable. c.  For vehicle turn-ins, enter the vehicle registration number  in positions 67-74 (suffixed with blanks when less than eight characters), an authorized vehicle status code (B, G, M, P, Q, S, T, or U) in position 75, and vehicle replacement  code A-H, J-M, or P-U in position 76.  When the vehicle status code is S or T, enter the gaining major command  code in positions 79-80.  Leave positions 79-80 blank for all other vehicle status codes.  When vehicle status code M is used, positions 48-50 must contain TRM. 12.  This information must be provided by requester.  If the request is submitted by letter or call-in, EAE personnel will enter data in required  positions on AF Form  2005. 13.  Supply condition code (position 44).  EAE determines supply condition code from the condition  statement in block E.  For unserviceable deficiency report  items, use supply condition code Q. 14.  When an I is entered in position 54 of the TIN, automatic FCI interface occurs to adjust the in-use authorized  quantity.  If the TIN quantity equals the total authorized quantity, the in-use detail will be deleted. 15.  If data classification code is left blank, normal processing will take place.  If the data classification code is entered in position 81 of the TIN and a shipment is expected to be output,  a hand receipt will be output  also.  The authorized  data classification codes (controlled item code) are:  A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, O, S, and T. 16.  If the organization’s control  record JOCAS (Job Order Cost Accounting System) Flag is set to a Y (turned  on), then a JOCAS control  number  must be entered. 17.  Use TEX code + to bypass EAID details for FOB turn-ins.  Do not use TEX + for COMSEC or Weapon assets.  A Report of Survey  must be accomplished for serialized control assets that are ‘found on base’. 6.2.4.  Return  (Turn-In)  Output  Notices 6.2.4.1.  Purpose.  To provide  information  about  what  documents  are produced when  a Return  (TIN) transaction  is  processed in  the  ILS-S. 6.2.4.2.  Management  Notice  Outputs.  Materiel  returns  (turn-ins)  that  increase  the serviceable  balance  or  create  unserviceable  details  will  result in  the  systematic production  of  various  management  notices.  Additional  item  record  data  is  printed 858 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 below the management  notice  phrase for selected  management  notices.  Table 6.7 shows what  output  notices  are produced  when  turn-in  transactions  are successfully  processed for given  sets of conditions.  See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for management  notices output  format  and distribution.  A single  input  may  generate  more than  one manage me nt notice.  For example,  successfully  processed XD2 item  turn-ins  result  in  the  creation  of an unserviceable  detail  and an I012 (Processed Date, Transaction  Serial  Number,  Stock Awaiting  Disposition)  or I013 (Processed,  Date, Transaction  Serial  Number,  Hold  For Shipment,  Time)  and  an  I035  (Depot  Level  Repair  (XD)  Item  Not  Shipped)  MGT notice. 6.2.4.3.  Output  Notice  Exceptions.   Generally,  an output  notice  is  produced for  each turn-in  (TIN)  processed.   There  are two  exceptions:  1) no  output  notice  is  produced  when  the entire  quantity  of  serviceable  turn-ins  are input  through  the  RPS/main  system  for  due-out release;  and 2) no output  notice  is  produced when  unserviceable  turn-ins  are input  through the  RPS/main  system  with  TEX  6 or F in  position  51 (manual  transaction). 6.2.4.4.  Rejects.    If  the  turn-in  is  rejected,  line  2  of  the  reject  notice  will  contain  the applicable  reject number  and phrase.  Line  3 will  contain  the current  date and serial  number of the last  transaction  processed before the reject.  I012 (Processed Date, Transaction  Serial Number,  Stock  Awaiting  Disposition)  or  I013  (Processed,  Date,  Transaction  Serial Number,  Hold  For  Shipment,  Time)  and  an  I035  (Depot  Level  Repair  (XD)  Item  Not Shipped)  MGT notice. 6.2.4.5.

Special-Type  Item  Transfers.   Some  items  require  special  disposal  processing. (RIW) Items. Improvement  Warranty 6.3.1.2.1.  Reliability transfer  of unserviceable  RIW assets to DLA  usually  does not  occur.  Exception:   If  the inventor y manager  determines  the  asset  is  to  be transferred  to DLA,  enter  the  serial  number  in positions  46-50 of  the  TRM.  It  is  strongly  recommended  the  input  contain  authorit y code  7 and  the  name  of  the  IM  directing  transfer  in  positions  65-78.   Note:    When AFMC/IM  does  not  wish  to  have  this  asset  returned  under  automatic  shipment procedures,  use  TEX  code 1 for  the TIN input.   The 6.3.1.2.2.  Clothing  Items.   Serviceable,  unserviceable  and  excess  clothing  items  may be transferred  to DLA.  Clothing  items  transferred  to DLA must  be marked in  a specific manner  if  the items  are assigned  Federal  Supply  Class  (FSC) 8405 through  8450 IAW DoD 4160.21-M. 6.3.1.2.3.  Cryptological  Materiel.   Stock Control  personnel  process transfers  to DLA for  both  serviceable  and unserviceable  Cryptological  materiel  (FSC 5810/5811 and/or MMAC CA, CI, CS, or CY) according  to established  procedures  as explained  below. identifying 6.3.1.2.3.1.  Cryptological  Materiel  Transfer  Procedures.  Cryptological  materiel  to DLADS,  unclassified  items  with  MMAC CA,  CI, or CY, or FSC 5810/5811  will be  demilitarized  prior  to  transferring.    If  required,  remove  all  nameplates  and markings   Once  removed, nameplates  and other removable  identifying  markings  will  be destroyed by burning, smelting,  or mutilation.   Identifying  markings  which  have  been  etched  or painted on  the  item  will  be obliterated  by  filing  or scraping  as appropriate  to  remove  the markings.    When  preparing  the  documentation  for  the  transfer  of  Cryptologica l materiel  to DLADS  do not furnish  the  former  classified  name  of the item.   Instead, the  item  with  a  former  classification. 862 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel  will  furnish  the  item  nomencla t ure and  a  commercial  description  (which  does  not  refer  to  NSA  or  a  Cryptologica l application).   Additionally,  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel  will enter “NO” in  Block  C of the DD 1348-1A transfer  (A5J) document  unless  the item requires  demilitarization.   See DoD  4160.28M-1 Vol  2, Defense Demilitarization: Demilitarization  Coding  for  more  information  concerning  the  demilitarization  of Cryptological  items.   See for a list  of  standard  DoD demilitarization  codes. 6.3.1.2.4.  Non-Saleable  Items.   Non-saleable  property  based on restrictions  by  law  or regulations is  such  property  as  herbicide  orange,  materiel  with  a  radioactive characteristic,  etc.    DLA  is  responsible  for  the  disposition  of  non-saleable  (non-restricted)  materiel  except  where  sales  are  prohibited  by  law  or  military  regulatio ns.   This  restriction  is  normally  based  upon  future  sales  value  of  the  materiel.   For  non-saleable  (restricted)  materiel, the  military  service(s)  will  be  responsible  for  the disposition  of  all  items  identified  as  non-saleable  when  the  sale  or  disposal  of  such items  is  restricted  by  law  or  by  military  regulations.   Note:      The  installa t io n commander  will  remain  responsible  for  the collection  and  disposal  of refuse  and trash.  6.3.1.2.5.  Critical  Safety  Item  (CSI).    Historical  maintenance  data  must  accompany reparable  CSI items  whenever  possible  for  all  base transfers  to DLADS.   CSI materiel which  lacks  required  supporting  documentation  will  be  mutilated  prior  to  being transferred  to DLADS.   Note:   DLADS  will  mutilate  CSI items  not  accompanied  by an AFTO  Form  95 or other historical  maintenance  record if  the items  have  not already been  mutilated.   The  term  “AFTO  Form  95  Required”  will  be  printed  on  all  output shipments  or transfer  documents  requiring  supporting  historical  maintenance  data.  The LRS/Materiel  Management  activity  inspector  should  contact  maintenance  when  this phrase  is  printed  on  serialized  reparable  items  and  no  maintenance  documentation  is available. 6.3.1.2.6.  Items  Without  Non-National  Stock Number  (Non-NSN) Items.  All  transfers to DLADS  for  non-NSN  items  will  have  a description  of  the  materiel  attached  to,  or annotated  on  the  disposal  document.   A  DD  1348-6 (Non-NSN Requisition)  may  be used if  available,  or the description  may  be provided  to DLADS  using  a method  agreed upon  by  the  supported  DLADS  and  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  activity.  Scrap materiel  or materiel  batched by lot number  for disposal  is excluded  from  the description requirement. 6.3.1.2.7.  Unserviceable  Items.    See  Para  5.9.2  or  condition  code  change  (FCC) transactions  and  the  procedures  for  transferring  expendable  assets  in  stock  which  are identified  as being  unserviceable.   Unserviceable  expendable  assets will  be transferred to DLADS  as follows: 6.3.1.2.7.1.  Condemned  expendable  (XB3)  items.   See AFMAN  23-122, Sec 6C, Disposal  and  Demilitarization  for  the  procedures  for  the  receipt  of  XB3  assets determined  to be condemned  by a LRS/Materiel  Management  activity  inspector. 6.3.1.2.7.2.  Unserviceable  equipment  (NF2)  items.    Equipment  items  (ERRCD equals  NF2) with  an  extended  dollar  value  of  less  than  $100 will  be transferred  to DLADS. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 863 6.3.1.2.7.3.  Unserviceable  reparable  (XD*/XF*)  items.   Reparable  items  (ERRCD equals  XD*/XF*)with  a  reparable  destination/disposition  code of  “DSP”  will  be transferred  to DLADS. 6.3.1.2.7.4.  Unserviceable  field  reparable  (XF3)  items  containing  budget  code 8.  Field  reparable  (ERRCD  equals  XF3)  items  containing  budget  code  8,  and  a reparable  destination/disposition  code  unequal  to  “RPT”,  will  be  transferred  to DLADS. 6.3.1.2.7.5.  Unserviceable  field  reparable  (XF3)  items  containing  budget  code 9.  Field  reparable  (ERRCD  equals  XF3)  items  containing  budget  code  9,  and  an extended  dollar  value  of less  than  $100 will  be transferred  to DLADS. 6.3.1.2.8.  Condemned  Radioactive  Equipment  Items.    Certain  radioactive  assets cannot  be  accepted  by  DLA  and  are  to  be  disposed  of  according  to  AFI  40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials In The Us Air Force as radioactive  waste.  Inspection personnel  will  use  Federal  Standard  313, Material Safety Data, Transportation Data, And Disposal Data, For Hazardous  Materials Furnished To Government Activities to identify  items  that  may  contain  hazardous/radioactive  material.   At the  end of  each month,  an  ILS-S utility  program  produces  a  listing  containing  all  stock  classes  from Table  I and all  stock groups  listed  in  Table  II.  See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5C, Physical Asset  Management  for  additional  information  about  how to identify  radioactive  items.   The  following  actions  required: 6.3.1.2.8.1.  Disposal  Shipment  Document  Preparation.   The  A5J document  output by  the  ILS-S  is  designed  to  transfer  the  radioactive  waste  materiel  to  the  DLA.   However,  radioactive  waste  must  be shipped  to a radioactive  waste  disposal  point IAW  AFI  40-201.    Therefore,  Distribution  personnel  must  1)  sign  the  disposal (A5J)  output  document  (created by  the condemnation  turn-in  (TIN) transaction)  in Block  7, and  2)  prepare  an  offline  (handscribed  or typed)  DD  1348-1A shipping document.   The offline  shipping  document  must  contain  the ship-to address in  block B and must  include  the  following  statement:  The  items  and quantities  listed  on this document  have  been  downgraded  to radioactive  waste  and  transferred  to the  LRS, Materiel  Management  or  Transportation  Activity  officer  for  shipment to  the radioactive  waste  disposal  point  according  to AFI 40-201. 6.3.1.2.8.2.  Disposal  Shipment  Document  Processing.   The materiel  and the offline shipping  document  will  be  forwarded  to  the  LRS/transportation  activity  func tio n for  processing  and  disposal.    LRS/transportation  activity  personnel  will  sign  and return  one copy of the  offline  DD 1348-1A to Distribution  personnel.   Distribut io n personnel  will  then  attach  the  returned  offline  DD  1348-1A to the  signed  A5J and send  both  documents  to  Document  Control  for  filing.    Note:      See  40-201  for detailed  procedures  for  packaging,  sampling,  handling,  and shipment  requests. 6.3.1.2.9.  Disposal  of  Industrial  Machinery  Services  (IMS)  Items.    When  disposal authority  is received  from  the IMS, personnel  process the transfer  of defense  industr ia l plant  equipment  items  to DLADS  using  manual  processing  and type  IMS DIRECTED into  block  AA of the DD 1348-1A. Personnel  send the following  to DLADS:   1) copies of  the DD  1342, DoD Property Record the  IMS letter  authorizing  disposal,  3) the  DD 1348-1A, and 4) the  Defense  Industrial  Plant  Equipment  property. 864 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 6.3.1.2.10.  Typewriters.   When  it  is  necessary  to  transfer  typewriters  to  DLADS, Inspection  personnel  should  handwrite  the  following  data  (if  available)  on  the  DD 1348-1A: make,  model,  type (standard,  silent,  noiseless,  portable,  manual,  or electric), carriage  width,  type face,  and serial  number.  These  data may  be entered  on the reverse of  the DD  1348-1A transfer  (A5J)  document  when  sufficient  space is  not available  on the  front  of  the  form.    Note:      The  provisions  of  this  paragraph  do  not  apply  to bookkeeping,  billing,  or teletype  machines. 6.3.1.2.11.  Hazardous  Material.    To  comply  Air  Force  and  DoD  policy  directives, Transfer  to  DLA  (DD  1348-1A)  documents  for  hazardous  material  or  waste  require additional  information.   See block  27 of  the  A5J  output  format  in  Para  6.3.2 for  the annotations  required  to transfer  hazardous  material  to DLADS. 6.3.1.2.11.1.  Hazardous  property  entered  on TRIC  A5J  DD 1348-1A.  Inspection personnel  manually  enter  information  in  blocks  26-27  of  the  A5J  DD  1348-1A (Transfer  to DLADS)  IAW  Para  6.3.2  A DD  1348-6 may  be used  if  available,  or the  description  may  be  provided  to  DLADS  using  a  method  agreed  upon  by  the supported  DLADS  and  materiel  management  activities. 6.3.1.2.11.2.  Provide  chemical  names.   If hazardous  property is for non-stock  listed (L/P)  numbers,  Inspection  personnel  provide  chemical  names  of  hazardous contaminants,  and noun  names  of  non-hazardous  contaminants. 6.3.1.2.11.3.  Provide  amount  of contaminants.   Inspection  personnel  also state  the amount  of  hazardous  and  non-hazardous  contaminants  as  determined  by  user's knowledge  or testing  of  the  item.   This  amount  is  expressed  in  a range  of  content by percentage  or parts per million,  as applicable. 6.3.1.2.11.4.  Certificate  for hazardous  property.   DoD  4160.21-M requires  special processing  for hazardous  material  being  turned  in to DLADS.   Whenever  hazardous material  packed in  containers  marked  HAZARDOUS  is  turned  in  for  disposal,  the reporting  activity  will  provide  DLADS  a  certificate  (in  triplicate)  stating the condition  and  reliability  of  the  container.    Because  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity  personnel  do not  have  the  expertise  to accurately  certify  the  reliability  of containers,  they  take the  following  steps  to  obtain  this  certificate  from  the  Cargo Movement: 6.3.1.2.11.4.1.  Property  segregated.    Segregate  hazardous  material  requiring certification  from  other  property  being  taken  to DLADS. transportatio n 6.3.1.2.11.4.2.  Inspection personnel  will  arrange  a mutually  agreeable  inspection  time.  Upon  conclusio n of  their  inspection, transportation  personnel  shall  complete  a  DD  1387-2, Special Handling  Data/Certification and attach  it  to the container.   Inspection  and time  arranged. 6.3.1.2.11.4.3.  Verification.   Inspection  personnel  verify  the identity,  quantity, and condition  of  the materiel.   They  then  sign  or stamp  and date block 27of  the DD 1348-1A.  Forward the property  and related  documentation  to Delivery  for processing  to the DLADS. 6.3.1.2.11.5.  Physical  Property  Custody.    DoD  policy  stipulates  that  a  base  may AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 865 retain  physical  custody  of  hazardous  material  while  transferring  accountability  to DLA.   However,  DLADS  may  refuse  certain  categories  of property  because of  the lack  of  special  handling  equipment,  inadequate  storage  facilities,  or  conflic t ing disposal  instructions.    If  any  of  the  above  situations  occur,  use  the  following procedures  to maintain  accountability  until  final  disposition  is  made: to  Inspection. 6.3.1.2.11.5.1.  Hazardous  Material  Acceptance  Refusal.   When  DLADS refuses  acceptance  of hazardous  material,  Documented  Cargo  personnel  return the property to the appropriate  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  storage  area (preferably  segregated  from  normal  base stocks)  and provide  the  DD 1348-1A (A5J)  transfer  document   Inspection  personnel  prepare  a condition  change  (FCC) transaction  to change  the supply  condition  of the  item to  condition  code  J  (suspended  in  stock).    The  condition  change  (FCC) transaction  and  the  document  control  copy  of  the  DD  1348-1A (A5J)  transfer document  is  sent  to  Document  Control.  Document  Control  personnel  will reverse-post  (RVP)  the  transfer  (A5J)  document  and  process  the  condition change  (FCC) transaction  to suspend  the materiel  in  stock.  Processing  the FCC transaction  will  place  the  disposal  quantity  on  a  ILS-S  unserviceable  detail record. Document  Control  will  file  the  document  control  copy of the  DD 1348-1A  transfer  (A5J)  document.   Note:      DLADS  should  be  contacted  by LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel MAJCOM,  AFMC,  or  DLA  activities  will  be  contacted  when  necessary  to resolve  the  situation. to  resolve this  situatio n.   6.3.1.2.11.5.2.  Hazardous  Material  Accountability  Acceptance.   In  some instances,  DLADS  may  accept accountability  for hazardous  material  but cannot accept physical  custody  of the  materiel.   When  DLADS  accepts accountabilit y, but refuses  physical  custody  of hazardous  material,  DLADS  personnel  sign  for the property  on copy one of the  DD 1348-1A transfer  (A5J) document.   Central Storage  personnel  will  return  the  hazardous  material  to an appropriate  storage area  properly  tagged  and  identified  as  belonging  to  DLADS.    The  document control  copy  of  the  DD  1348-1A  transfer  (A5J)  document  will  be  sent  to Document  Control.

Transfer  to  DLADS  (A5J)  Document  Destination.   The  ILS-S, upon  input transfer  (TRM)  processing,  directs  the  DD 1348-1A transfer  document  (A5J) to either the  input  terminal,  warehouse  terminal,  or  the  applicable  satellite  terminal.    Note:   Transfer  documents  for terminals  are printed  on the main  printer.   Transfer  documents 872 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 created  on  warehouse  terminals  apply  if  the  items  are  held  on  ILS-S  unserviceab le detail  records  containing  a  valid  warehouse  location.    Transfer  documents  directed from  satellite  accounts  (A1–A9)  will  be  returned  to  the  satellite  input  terminal.    All other  output  transfer  documents  will  be printed  on the  main  RPS printer. 6.3.4.3.  Transfer  Document  (DD  1348-1A)  Distribution.    If  the  DD  1348-1A  transfer document  contains  demilitarization  codes  F or  G  forward  all  copies  of  the  DD  1348-1A transfer  document  to  Inspection  for  processing.    All  other  transfer  document  will  be forwarded  to Central  Storage  personnel. 6.3.4.4.  Central  Storage  Responsibilities.    After  receiving  the  DD  1348-1A    transfer document,  Central  Storage  personnel  perform  a warehouse  validation  if  line  21 of the  DD 1348-1A document  indicates  the  transfer  to DLADS  reduced  the  item  record serviceable balance  to  zero  (0).   Subsequently,  Central  Storage  personnel  will  select  the  transferred materiel,  sign  and  date  line  26  of  the  DD  1348-1A  transfer  document,  and  forward  the materiel  and  transfer  document  to Inspection  personnel. 6.3.4.5.  Inspection  Section  Responsibilities.    After  receiving  the  DD  1348-1A  transfer document  from  Central  Storage personnel,  Inspection  personnel  will  determine  what action is  required  based  upon  the  demilitarization  code.  If  the  transferred  materiel  meets established low-dollar  value  requirements,  Inspection  will  downgrade  the  transferred materiel  to scrap. 6.3.4.5.1.  Hazardous  Materiel  Transfer  Requirements.   DoD  4160.21-M  requires special  handling  of  hazardous  material  transferring  to DLADS.   Whenever  hazardous material  packed in  the  container  marked  HAZARDOUS  is  turned  in  for  disposal,  the reporting  activity  will  provide  the servicing  DLADS  a certificate  (in  triplicate)  as to the true  condition  and  reliability  of  the  container.    Note:      LRS/Materiel  Management personnel  do  not  have  the  expertise Therefore,  the  following  actions  must  be taken  to  obtain  a container  certificate  from either  the  LRS/transportation  activity,  or the  most  knowledgeable  individual  from  the submitting  organization. to  accurately  certify  container reliabilit y.   6.3.4.5.2.  Segregate  hazardous  material.   Segregate  hazardous  material  requiring  the certificate  from  other  property  being  taken to DLADS. 6.3.4.5.3.  Perform  container  reliability  inspection.   Contact  the  Cargo Movement  and an  individual  from  the  using  organization  and  arrange  a  mutually  agreeable  time  to inspect  and  certify  the  materiel  and  container.    Upon  conclusion  of  the  inspectio n, Cargo Movement  personnel  or the individual  from  the using  organization  will  complete a certificate  (in  triplicate)  as to the true  condition  and reliability  of the  container. 6.3.4.5.4.  Distribute  transfer  document.   After  the  above  steps  have  been  completed, verify  the  identity,  quantity,  and  condition  of  the  materiel  and  sign  or stamp  and  date copies one through  three of the DD 1348-1A (line  30). Send the property  and the related documentation  to Documented  Cargo  for processing  to the  DLADS. 6.3.4.5.5.  Hazardous  Non-stock  Listed  (Non-NSN)  Item  Transfers.    If  transferred materiel is  considered  non-stock  listed  (L/P  numbers)  and  hazardous,  Inspection personnel  will  provide  the  chemical  name  of  the  hazardous  contaminants  and  the common  name  of  the  non-hazardous  contaminants.    Inspection  personnel  will  also AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 873 provide  the  amount  of  hazardous  and  non-  hazardous  contaminants  based  upon  the user's  knowledge  or  testing  of  the  materiel  by  percentage  or  parts  per  millio n.   Inspection  personnel  will  retrieve  the ILS-S-generated  transfer  document  and manually enter  this  information  on  the  DD  1348-1A  transfer  document.    See  Para  6.3.3  for details  about the  Transfer  document  (A5J)  output. 6.3.4.6.  Documented  Cargo Responsibilities.   Pick-up and Delivery  personnel  will  provide all  copies  of  the  DD  1348-1A transfer  document  and  materiel  to DLADS.   DLADS  will sign/stamp  and date the DD 1348-1A output  transfer  document  and return  it to Pick-up and Delivery  personnel.  Note:  When  demilitarization  must  be performed  before  the  physical transfer  of  hazardous  material  to  DLADS,  Copy  Two  (2)  of  the  DD  1348-1A  transfer document  will  be used  to hand  receipt  property  to the  function  doing  the  demilitarizat io n.   For  each  transfer,  DLADS  retains  all  TRANS  copies  of  the  DD  1348-1A  transfer document. 6.3.4.7.  Document  Control  Responsibilities.  The Document  Control  copy of the DD 1348-1A transfer  document  (returned  by Documented  Cargo) will  be used to clear  the document control  image  (DCC) suspense.  Document  Control  personnel  will  file  the  document  after quality  control  of the  source document  has been performed.   Transfers 6.3.4.8.  DLADS  Signed  Copy  Exclusions. include  a demilitarization  certificate  with  the  word  DESTROYED  or  WASTE  printed  on  the  DD 1348-1A.  In  this  circumstance,  the  demilitarization  certificate  is  treated  as a valid  receipt from  DLADS.        Additionally, transfers  to  DLADS  may  also  include  a  downgrade certificate  signed  or stamped  by Inspection  personnel.   In this  circumstance,  the downgrade certificate  is  considered  a valid  receipt  from  DLADS.   No DLADS  signature  or signature copy of the  DD 1348-1A transfer  document  is  required  for  Document  Control  filing. to  DLADS  may 6.3.5.  Processing Procedures  For  ICP-Directed  Transfers To DLADS. 6.3.5.1.  Purpose.    To  explain  disposal  authority  criteria  and  ILS-S  processing  of  ICP-directed  transfers  of materiel  to DLADS. 6.3.5.2.  Wholesale-Directed  Transfers  to DLADS  Transactions.   ICP-directed  transfers  to DLADS  may  be  initiated  by  AFMC,  Contractor,  DLA,  GSA,  and  other  Service  ICPs.  Different  transactions  are used  by the  ICPs to initiate  the  transfer  actions.   See Para  6.3.7 for  detailed  information  regarding transactions  used  depending  upon  the disposal  authority. the  specific 6.3.5.3.  AFMC  and  Contractor  ICP-Directed  Transfers.    AFMC  and  Contractor  ICP-directed  transfers  of  materiel  to DLA  Disposition  Services  are initiated  via  redistribut io n order  (A2*)  and  referral  order (A4*)  transactions.  See AFH  23-123, Vol  1, Ch  2 for  the format  of  A2*/A4*  transactions.    These  transactions  are  used  to  direct  transfer  of  either serviceable  or  unserviceable  materiel to DLADS  may  be identified  in  the  ILS-S by  “YDISPL”  located  in  positions  45-50 of  the A2*/A4* transfer  transactions.   Note:   Forward all  wholesale-directed  redistribution  order (A2*) or referral  order (A4*)  transactions  containing  an “E”  or “5”  in  the third  position  of the  document  identifier  field  (i.e.,  A2E,  A45)  to AFMC  SCM R  Stock  Control  Activit y.   These  types  of  transactions  are considered  controlled  exceptions.   These  transactions  will to  DLADS  vs.  Wholesale-directed transfers 874 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 be processed on  a manual  basis  as described  in  AFMAN  23-122, Ch  2 Sec 2E, Degraded Operations. 6.3.5.4.  Transfer  of  Serviceable  Assets.    Redistribution  order  (A2*)  and  referral  order (A4*)  transactions  for  wholesale-directed  transfer  of  serviceable  items  to  DLADS  are processed  in  the  ILS-S applicable  to established  disposal  authority  criteria.   ICP-directed transfers  that  are processed  in  the  ILS-S normally  result  in  automatic  transfers  of  materiel to DLADS.   Bases  can  suppress  automatic  transfers  to DLADS  by  setting  a flag  on  their base constants  record.  When  the  flag  is  set, the  ILS-S produces  transfer  to DLADS  input (TRM)  notices.    Also  note  items  with  Weapon  System  Details  are  not  authorized  for transfer  to  DLADS.    Weapon  System  Details  are  assigned  to  items  that  can  be  linked directly  to weapon  systems  and to other  high  priority  items. 6.3.5.5.  Transfer  of  Unserviceable  Assets.   A  ICP-directed  transfer  of  an  unserviceab le item  to DLADS  is provided  through  the redistribution  order (A2*) transaction.   Upon input, the ILS-S locates  and decreases/deletes  the unserviceable  detail  record.  Note:   No disposal authority  criteria  are applied  to unserviceable  transfers  to DLA  Disposition  Services. 6.3.5.6.  DLA,  GSA,  and  Other  Service-Directed  Transfers.   ICP-directed  transfers (disposals)  initiated  by DLA,  GSA, and other  Service  ICPs are communicated  to bases via FTR  transactions  with  excess  status  “TC”    The  ILS-S  criteria  for  honoring  FTRs  with excess  status  code TC are detailed  in  Table 6.14.

Additional  FTR Processing  Information.   The  following paragraphs  provide  additional  information  about ILS-S FTR processing  actions  when FTR materiel  transfer  transactions  are honored  and denied.  Processing  Honored  FTRs.   Whenever  an FTR with  excess status  TC is  processed in  the ILS-S; the system  performs a requirements  computation  to determine  if  the base excess  asset position  has  changed since  the excess  was reported.  When  the criteria  in  Table 6.11 have  been  met  and the requirements  computation  indicates  no change  in  the  base excess  asset position,  FTRs are honored  by the  ILS-S.  When  the  FTR is  honored,  the  system  outputs  an A5J shipping  document.   Each  honored  FTR is  also  documented  via  appropriate  transaction history  records.   See AFH 23-123 Vol  2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for  information  about  transaction history  details.   6.3.5.7.  Processing  Denied  FTRs.    If  the  requirements  computation  indicates  the  base excess  asset  position  has  changed  such  that  the  FTR  can  no  longer  be fully  honored,  the system  produces  and  transmits  a  Report  of  Customer  Excess  Cancellation (FTC) transaction  to  the  ICP  to  advise  that  the  material  transfer  order  was  totally  or  partially denied.   At  the  time  the  FTC is  produced,  the  ILS-S deletes  the  excess  detail  record  and creates the  appropriate  transaction  history  record. 6.3.6.  Scrap  Classification  And  Segregation Guide. 6.3.6.1.  Purpose.    To  provide  the  procedures  and  segregation  codes  required  for  scrap classification  and  segregation. 6.3.6.2.  Scrap Classification  and Segregation  Guide.   Reference  Table 6.12 to assist  with identification  and segregation  of scrap materiel.   Note:   DLADS  has the final  responsibilit y for  scrap segregation.   To simplify  the  segregation  process, materiel  should  be segregated as  accumulated  by  base  organizations  if  possible.    This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  materiel segregation  is normally  easier  to perform  at the scrap collection  point  rather  than  DLADS.   This  is especially  true  for scrap metal.   Contamination  or mixing  of several  grades  of scrap results  in  increased  processing  costs  and/or  reduced  sales.   Note:   Trash  and  refuse  are never  delivered  to DLADS. 876 AFH23-123V2PT1   8 AUGUST  2013 6.3.6.3.  DLADS  should  determine the  degree  of  segregation  required,  assist  in  the identification  of  metals  not  easily  identified,  and  provide  receptacles  (barrels,  containers, etc.) to be placed at base collection  points.

Disposal  Metrics.   Disposal  authority  codes provide  AF/A4LM  with  meaningf ul disposal  data  for  analysis  of  Air  Force  property  transfers  to  DLA  Disposition  Services.   Disposal  data is  extracted  from  the  ILS-S M32 report,  “Stratification  of DLA  Disposit io n Services  Transfers.”   The M32 results  are used to validate  and/or  modify  Air  Force excess materiel  retention  policies. 6.3.7.3.  Disposal  Authority  Codes.  The  disposal  authority  codes listed  below  are edited by  the  ILS-S for  validity  and  stored  in  the  transaction  history  record.   Disposal  authorit y codes are used on  Transfer  to DLA  Disposition  Services  (TRM)  transactions  to justify  the transfer  of the  materiel.   When  the  TRM  transaction  disposal  authority  code does not  pass ILS-S edits  or is blank  on input,  a 307 reject will  be produced.

Weapons Serialized  Control  Input  (DSR) - Format  Two AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 919 10.2.5.1.  Purpose.  Depending  on the  type  phrase  used,  this  input  will  create or delete a serialized  control  detail  (249 record),  or an in-use  serialized  control  (250 record),  or will  modify  either  one in  preparation  for  subsequent  inline  processing.  This  format  is  to be used by the base-level  user  to modify  records of serialized  weapons at or received by  his/her  base. Up  to ten  (10)  serial  numbers  may  be processed  with  a single  input. Note: This  input  is  used  to  identify  to  the  SBSS  a  specific  serialized  control  detail document  number  and  serial  number  for  processing.  After  processing  the  DSR,  and prior to processing  the subsequent  transaction,  it is imperative  that only  those serialized details  just  flagged  with  DSR  have  the  appropriate  action  code.  Example: When  using DSR  to  flag  one  or  more  250  records  for  an  inventory  adjustment  (type  phrase  - IADDTL),  only  those  250 records being  adjusted  may  have  a 250-ACTION-CODE of ‘A’ loaded. If any  other records have  this  action  code loaded, the program  will  produce a  616  reject.  When  processing  inventory  adjustments,  you  must  process  a  DSR  to identify  the serial  number(s)  to be adjusted;  for all  other  items  when  the  entire  balance of  a  selected  detail  (250  record),  or  warehouse  balance  (249  record),  DSR  is  not required. 10.2.5.2.  Input  Restrictions.   None. 10.2.5.3.  Output.    Creates,  modifies  or  deletes  selected  serialized  control  detail  (249 record)  or in-use  serialized  control  (250 record).

Enter  the document  number  as it appears on the  serialized  control  detail  (249 record) or the  in-use  serialized  control  (250 record).  When  using  DSR to load/create  a serialized control  detail  (249 record) use  the MILSTRIP  requisition  number  of the  receipt document  or 99S input  due-in  detail.   When  creating  an in-use  serialized  control  (250 record) for  RVP, use the  stock number  and document  number  being  reverse-posted.   The MILSTRIP  document  number  must  be proceeded by the  stock record account  number (examples  FE420891510025, FB420892650099). 2.  The  suffix  code is  only  used to identify  a partial  receipt  to the  computer.   If  your document  number  includes  a suffix  code, it  must  be input  or the  program  will  reject.   Otherwise,  leave  this  field  blank. 3.  Left  justified,  alpha/numeric.   Do not  use spaces prior  to serial  number.   Enter  up to ten  (10) separate  serial  numbers.   Use the  serial  number  entry  fields  sequentially,  i.e.,  if you  have  three  serial  numbers  to process, use  input  entry  fields  1, 2, and 3 - not 1, 4, and 7.  If  your  serial  number’s  first  position  is a zero,  enter  a zero.   For example,  serial number  012345 would  read 012345(b)(b)(b)(b)(b)  where  (b) equals  a blank. 4.  Enter  your  base Stock Record Account  Number  (SRAN) in  positions  69-74.  For type account  code ‘E’, enter  FE then  the address of  your  account.   If the  type account  code is ‘B’, then  enter  FB.  EXAMPLE:   FE4659 or FB4300. 5.  For FED processing,  use Type  Phrase  ‘SHIPPED’. 6.  The  input  NSN must  be loaded  with  a serialized  report code of ‘A’  or program  will produce  a 619 reject. 10.2.5.5.  The  following  information  applies: Table 10.6.  Type Phrase & Resulting Action. Type Phrase Resulting Action AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 921 SHIPPED Loads a serialized  control  detail  (249 record) prior  to REC processing. ISU/DOR Prepares a serialized  control  detail  (249 record) for issues,  due-out  releases, shipments,  transfers,  and condition  code changes. MSI Prepares an in-use  serialized  control  (250 Record) prior  to processing  an MSI from  a Readiness  Spares Package, MSK, T-MSK, Supply  Point  or WRM details. This  phrase  will  create a serialized control  record (249 detail)  reflecting  the stock number,  SRAN/MILSTRIP document  number,  and serial  number when  a requisition  is  initiated  by  your activity  and the item  is  received. A serialized  control  detail  (249 record) will  be created for each item  for subsequent  REC  processing. This  phrase  is used  to identify  a specific stock number  and serial  number  to be issued  or due-out released  from  on-hand warehouse  balance. (The  existing  249 record document number  does not have  to be changed  to coincide  with  the  requester’s  document number  for follow-on  processing.)

COMSEC Serialized  Control  Input  (XHB)  - Format  Two. 10.2.14.1.  Purpose. Depending  on the  type phrase used,  this  input  will  create or delete a serialized  control  detail  (249 record)  or an in-use  serialized  control  (250 record),  or will  modify  either  one in  preparation  for  subsequent  inline  processing.  This  format  is to be used by the  base level  user  to modify  records of  serialized  COMSEC assets at or received  by his/her  base. Up to ten (10) serial  numbers  may  be processed with  a single input.  Note: This  input  is  used  to  identify  to  the  SBSS  a  specific  serialized  control detail  document  number  and  serial  number  for  processing.  After  processing  the XHB, and  prior  to  processing  the  subsequent  transaction,  it  is  imperative  that  only  those serialized  details  just  flagged  with  XHB have  the appropriate  action  code. EXAMPLE: When  using  XHB/DSR  to flag  one  or more  250 records  for  an  inventory  adjustment (type  phrase  -  IADDTL),  only  those  250  records  being  adjusted  may  have  a  250-ACTION-CODE of  ‘A’ loaded.  If  any  other  records  have  this  action  code loaded,  the program  will  produce  a 616 reject.  When  processing  inventory  adjustments,  you  must process an XHB/DSR  to identify  the serial  number(s)  to be adjusted;  for  all  other  items when  the  entire  balance  of  a selected  detail  (250  record),  or  warehouse  balance  (249 record), XHB/DSR  are not  required. 10.2.14.2.

Enter  the document  number  as it appears on the  serialized  control  detail  (249 record) or the  in-use  serialized  control  (250 record).  When  using  XHB  to load/create  a serialized control  detail  (249 record) use  the MILSTRIP  requisition  number  of the  receipt document  or 99S input  due-in  detail.   When  creating  an in-use  serialized  control  (250 record) for  RVP, use the  stock number  and document  number  being  reverse-posted.   The MILSTRIP  document  number  must  be proceeded by the  stock record account  number (examples  FE420891510025, FB420892650099). 2.  The  suffix  code is  only  used to identify  a partial  receipt  to the  computer.   If  your document  number  includes  a suffix  code, it  must  be input  or the  program  will  reject.   Otherwise,  leave  this  field  blank.   If this  is  a PSP/FSL receipt  and  the 202 demand  code equals  Z, add suffix  code Z to the XHB  input. 3.  Left  justified,  alpha/numeric.   Do not  use spaces prior  to the  serial  number.   Enter  up to ten  (10) separate serial  numbers.   Use the serial  number  entry  fields  sequentially,  i.e., if  you  have  three  serial  numbers  to process, use  input  entry  fields  1, 2, and 3 - not  1, 3, and 5.  If  your  serial  number’s  first  position  is a zero,  enter  a zero.   For example,  serial number  012345 would  read 012345(b)(b)(b)(b)(b)  where  (b) equals  a blank. 4.  Enter  your  base Stock Record Account  Number  (SRAN) in  positions  51-56.  For type account  code ‘E’, enter  FE then  the address of  your  account.   If the  type account  code is ‘B’, then  enter  FB.  EXAMPLE:   FE4659 or FB4300. 5.  For FED processing,  use Type  Phrase  ‘SHIPPED’. 6.  The  input  NSN must  be loaded  with  a serialized  report code of ‘C’ or program  will produce  a 619 reject. AFH23-123V2PT1  8 AUGUST 2013 939 7.

A serialized  control  detail  (249 record) will  be created for  each item  for subsequent  REC processing.  ISU/DOR Prepares a serialized  control  detail This  phrase  is  used to identify  a specific  stock number  and serial  number  to be issued  or due-out (249 record)  for issues,  due-out releases,  shipments,  transfers,  and condition  code changes. released  from  on-hand  warehouse  balance. (The  existing  249 record document  number  does not have  to be changed  to coincide  with  the requester’s  document  number  for  follow-on processing.) This  phrase  is  also  used for  shipments,  transfers, and condition  changes  when  the total  on-hand quantity  in  the warehouse  is  not to be released. The  program  will  locate  and modify  a serialized control  detail  (249 record) based on the input stock number,  document  number,  and serial number.   If  loaded the  249-ACTION-CODE will be set to an ‘I’.  MSI Prepares an in-use  serialized control  (250 Record) prior  to processing  a MSI from  a Readiness  Spares Package, MSK, This  phrase  is  used to identify  a specific  stock number,  document  number  (RSP, MSK, T-MSK, Supply  Point,  and WRM details)  and  serial number  to be released  by MSI processing  when the  total  on-hand  quantity  of the  detail  is  not  to be T-MSK, Supply  Point  or WRM details. released.
