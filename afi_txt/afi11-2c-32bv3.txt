The  ANG  headquarters  maintains  command  and control (C2) and waiver authority for ANG crews performing any ANG directed mission prior  to  mobilization.    Waiver  authority  for  these  missions  is  the  NGB/A3  unless otherwise directed by this AFI.  (T-2) 1.4.3.2.  AFSOC  Directed  Missions.  Waiver  authority  for  ANG  units  flying  AFSOC missions is the AFSOC/A3 unless otherwise directed by this AFI.  (T-2) 1.4.3.2.1.  When  the  directed  waiver  authority  is  Operations  Group  (OG)/CC  (or equivalent), AFSOC/A3V is the waiver authority.  (T-2) 1.4.3.2.2.  AFSOC/A3  may  delegate  this  authority  to  Commander  Air  Force  Special Operations  Forces for  operationally  assigned  SOF  during deployed/contingency  operations.    If  the  AFSOC/A3  chooses  to  delegate  waiver authority,  it  will  be  documented  in  writing  and  will  specify  which  portions  of  this instruction may be waived by the COMAFSOF.  (T-2) (COMAFSOF) 1.4.3.2.3.  When  waiver  authority  is  delegated,  AFSOC/A3V  receives  a  copy  of  all approved waivers.  (T-2) 1.5.  Supplements.  Operations  Group  (OG)/CC  (or  equivalent)  shall  define  local  operating procedures in a supplement to  Chapter 10.  OG/CC (or equivalent) shall obtain MAJCOM/A3 approval prior to releasing Chapter 10.  Local supplements can not be less restrictive than this AFI.  (T-2) 1.6.  Distribution.  Unit commanders will provide copies for all aircrew members and associated support personnel.  (T-2) 1.7.  Changes.  Recommendations  for  improvement  to  this  instruction  are  encouraged.  Send  to 150  SOS/DOV,  on  an  AF  Form  847,  Recommendation  for  Change  of  Publication.  150 SOS/DOV will coordinate all changes through AFSOC/A3V and NGB/(Training) A3T.  (T-2) 14 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 Chapter 2 COMMAND AND CONTROL 2.1.  General.  The  AFSOC  command  and  control  (C2)  system  is  based  on  the  principles  of centralized  monitoring  through  the  AFSOC  Operations  Center  (OC)  and  decentralized  control and execution.  The result is a C2 mechanism which keeps the AFSOC Commander informed of the current status of forces while enabling the wing or group commander to exercise control over day-to-day execution of operations. 2.2.  Operational  Control  (OPCON).  AFSOC  is  designated  as  the  controlling  agency  for United  States  Special  Operations  Command  (USSOCOM)  assigned  aircraft,  while  Theater Special  Operations  Commands  (TSOC)  have  OPCON  of  theater-based  assets.    In  practice, responsibility for planning and executing AFSOC missions is routinely delegated to the wing or group commander. The  wing or  group commander, in  turn, exercises control of non-close-hold missions through the appropriate C2 agency.  In the event that assigned/aligned forces undergo a change  in  operational  control  (CHOP),  responsibility  for  mission  monitoring  passes  from  the wing or group C2 facility to the gaining command.  Changeover is accomplished in accordance with  (IAW) the  pertinent  Operation  Plan  (OPLAN),  Operation  Order  (OPORD),  or deployment/execution order (DEPORD).  (T-2) 2.3.  Execution Authority.  Execution approval for all operational missions is received from the MAJCOM/C2.    The  108  OG/CC  (or  equivalent)  is  the  executing  authority  for  local  training missions.    The  PIC  has  mission  execution  authority  while  operating  outside  communications channels.  (T-2) 2.3.1.  Supplemental  Training  Mission  (STM).    Opportune  airlift  of  cargo  and  mission personnel  may be accomplished as a by-product  of crew training missions.  STM’s may be authorized when minor adjustments can be made to a scheduled training mission or when a productive  aircrew-training  mission  can  be  generated  for  the  airlift.    The  training  mission cannot be degraded in any manner to accomplish the STM.  The OG/CC (or equivalent) with Wing/CC coordination may approve STM’s.  (T-2) 2.3.2.  Off  Station  Training  Flight  (OSTF).    Wing/CC  (or  equivalent)  is  the  approval authority  for  all  off  station  trainers.    Prior  to  approval,  commanders  will  carefully  review each  proposed  trainer's  itinerary  to  ensure  it  justifies  and  represents  the  best  avenue  for meeting  training  requirements.    (T-2)    Commanders  approving  off  station  trainers  will forward a copy of the planned itinerary to the NGB/A3JG (NGB Special Missions Branch), AFSOC  OC/SPDP  (Operations  Center/Strategic  Plans  Division  Plans),  and  AFSOC/SAO (Special Activities Office) no later than 30 days prior to departure for training that remains overnight  (RON)  outside  U.S.  jurisdiction  and  no  later  than  7  days  for  training  that  RONs within  U.S.  jurisdiction.    (T-2)    If  it  is  not  possible  to  meet  these  lead  times,  submit itineraries as soon as possible and approval is on a case-by-case basis. 2.4.  Pilot  In  Command  (PIC)  Responsibility  and  Authority.  A  PIC  is  designated  for  all flights  on  the  flight  authorizations  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-401,  Flight  Management  and applicable MAJCOM supplements.  PICs are:  (T-2) 2.4.1.  In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.  (T-2) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 15 2.4.2.  Responsible for the welfare of the crew and passengers and the safe accomplishment of the mission.  (T-2) 2.4.3.  Vested  with  the  authority  necessary  to  manage  crew  resources  and  accomplish  the mission.  (T-2) 2.4.4.  The  final  mission  authority  makes  decisions  not  specifically  assigned  to  higher authority. 2.4.5.  The  final  authority  for  requesting  or  accepting  any  waivers  affecting  the  crew  or mission.  (T-2) 2.4.6.  Responsible  for  passing  mission  progress  reports  daily  to  C2  agencies.    PICs  must inform C2 agencies of factors that may impact mission accomplishment.  (T-2) 2.4.7.  Responsible for interaction between aircrew members, mission support personnel and passengers.    PICs  will  establish  a  point-of-contact  (POC)  with  the  appropriate  C2  agency prior to entering crew rest.  (T-2) 2.5.  Mission Clearance Decision.  The final decision to delay a mission may be made either by the agency with OPCON or the PIC when, in the opinion of either, conditions are not safe to start or continue a mission.  Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the PIC.  If  the  PIC  refuses  a  mission,  it  does  not  depart  until  the  conditions  have  been  corrected  or improved so that the mission can operate safely.  Do not alert another PIC and crew. 2.5.1.  Diverting or rerouting a mission is authorized by the commander with OPCON, except in an emergency or when required by en route or terminal weather conditions or facilities.  In the event of an emergency or weather related divert or reroute, the mission or PIC notifies the controlling authority as soon as possible. 2.5.2.  The  controlling  authority  directing  the  rerouting  or  diversion  is  responsible  for ensuring destination requirements or facilities are adequate for the aircraft.  (T-2) 2.5.3.  The PIC will notify the controlling authority of any aircraft or aircrew limitations that may preclude diversion or rerouting of the mission.  (T-2) 2.5.4.  When directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the controlling authority will ensure the PIC is provided existing and forecast weather for the alternate.  If the planned alternate is unsuitable upon arrival  at  destination, the controlling authority will advise the PIC of other suitable alternates.  (T-2) 2.6.  Aircrew  Responsibilities.  The  PIC  is  the  focal  point  for  interaction  between  aircrew, mission support personnel and passengers.  It is imperative that the aircrew notify the PIC of all issues  that  may  affect  mission  accomplishment.    Any  aircrew  member  is  empowered  to  make decisions for safety at any time, and then notify the PIC of their actions.  (T-2) 2.7.  Operational C2 Reporting.  The PIC or Airborne Mission Systems Specialist (AMSS) will report standard aircraft movement information (departure, arrival or diversion) to the appropriate C2  agencies.    (T-2)    Communications  Security  (COMSEC)  and  OPORD  requirements  may dictate appropriate messaging methods.  The PIC will establish a point of contact with the local C2  agency  (Command  Post,  AMC  station  manager,  U.S.  Embassy,  U.S.  Consulate,  or  FBO) before entering crew rest.  (T-2) 16 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 2.7.1.  Unusual Circumstances.  Notify the appropriate C2 agencies immediately through the best  means  available  of  any  unusual  occurrence.    This  includes  maintenance,  aircraft malfunctions, security and operational concerns.  Do not wait until arrival to send message if able.  If information is sensitive in nature, do not use local agencies.  (T-2) 2.8.  Mission  Commander  Responsibilities.  Unit Commanders or above may direct a mission commander to act as the overall POC for the mission.  The mission commander is the focal point for complex missions and multi-sortie events.  Mission commanders must inform the appropriate C2 of any factors that may affect mission accomplishment.  (T-2)  The unit commander delegates primary  responsibility  for  mission  management  to  the  mission  commander.    PICs  remain  the final  authority  for  all  operational  matters  pertaining  to  their  aircraft,  crew,  and  mission.    The mission commander cannot  be a primary crew  member; however the Mission  Commander will be  a  rated  and  has  to  be  a  field  grade  officer  qualified  in  the  type  mission.    The  mission commander's actions include but are not limited to:  (T-2) 2.8.1.  Briefing crews on local operating procedures.  (T-2) 2.8.2.  Coordinating  with  ATC,  passengers,  and  other  agencies  that  may  have  an  impact  on the mission.  (T-2) 2.8.3.  Ensuring  personnel  have  ample  and  adequate  billeting,  eating,  and  transportation arrangements.  (T-2) 2.8.4.  Ensuring maintenance personnel know of aircraft and fuel requirements.  (T-2) 2.8.5.  Responsible for the timely reporting of aircraft movements.  (T-2) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 17 Chapter 3 CREW COMPLEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 3.1.  Aircrew  Qualification.  Primary  crew  members  or  those  occupying  a  primary  position during flight must be qualified or in training for qualification in that crew position.  (T-2)  If non-current, or in training for a particular event, the crew member must be under the supervision  of an  instructor  while  accomplishing  that  event.    Direct  instructor  supervision  (at  the  controls)  is necessary for critical phases of flight. 3.1.1.  Mission ready crew members may perform primary crew duties on any sortie.  (T-2) 3.1.2.  Mission capable crew members may perform primary duties on any unilateral training mission.    For  other  missions,  the  unit  commander  will  determine  the  readiness  of  each mission capable crew member to perform primary crew duties.  (T-2) 3.2.  Pilots.  Unit CC/Director of Operations (DO) shall designate a PIC and form aircrews with a  sufficient  number  of  pilots  to  accomplish  the  mission.    (T-2)    The  PIC  shall  be  qualified  to perform all duties as a primary aircrew member.  (T-2)  An instructor pilot (IP) must supervise non-current  or  unqualified  pilots  regaining  currency  or  qualification.    (T-2)    Comply  with  the requirements for pilots in dual controlled aircraft in AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.  (T-2) 3.2.1.  Missions with Passengers.  Pilots must have a current and valid AF Form 8 for the C-32B to fly with passengers.  (T-2)  Only a pilot that is qualified occupies a pilot’s seat with passengers  onboard  the  aircraft  (N/A  unit  maintenance  personnel  or  designated  MEPs approved by the unit CC/DO).  One of the following is a requisite for pilots to fly passengers: 3.2.1.1.  Two qualified and current pilots are at the controls. 3.2.1.2.  A qualified pilot non-current less than 60 days for flying requirements and an IP providing direct supervision.  Exception:  Pilots non-current in an overseas sortie can fly under the supervision of another pilot current in overseas requirements.  (T-2) 3.2.1.3.  A  C-32B  qualified  General  Officer  or  senior  staff  members  may  occupy  either pilot  seat  under  direct  IP  supervision.    Refer  to  AFI  11-2C-32B,  Vol  1  for  supervisory flying restrictions. 3.2.2.  Qualification  Training.    Initial  qualification,  re-qualification,  or  upgrade  training  for pilots  is  not  conducted  on  missions  with  passengers  onboard  (N/A  unit  maintenance personnel or designated MEPs approved by unit CC/DO). 3.3.  Airborne Mission System Specialists (AMSS) and Loadmasters (LM). 3.3.1.  AMSS or LM that are non-current or unqualified may perform duties in their primary crew position on any sortie when under direct supervision of a qualified instructor or flight examiner  in  their  respective  crew  position.    In  this  case,  the  student  crew  member  and  the instructor or flight examiner fulfills the requirement for one primary position as specified in Table 3.1 of this AFI. Exception:  AMSS or LM that are non-current for an overseas sortie may perform duties in their primary crew position under the supervision of a current aircrew member in the same crew position.  (T-2) 18 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 3.4.  Crew  Complement.  Minimum  crew  complement  is  specified  in  Table  3.1    If  resources permit,  commanders may  add crew members to  enhance mission accomplishment or maximize training. Table 3.1.

A LM is only required when passengers or patients are carried.  Exception:  Unit assigned military/civilian maintenance personnel do not require a LM.  One  LM is required if 40 or fewer passengers are carried.  Two LM are required for more than 40  passengers.  If available, a second AMSS may augment in place of the second LM, within the Flt Duty Period (FDP) limitations and with unit CC/DO approval.  This exception only applies to basic FDPs. 6.  Only one LM is required when passengers or patients are not carried. 7.  An AMSS is not required for local area training missions but may be a primary crew member  to accomplish appropriate training/currency requirements.    A 2.5 hour equal time point (ETP)  constitutes the local area for training. 3.5.  Mission  Essential  Personnel  (MEP).  MEP  status  is  granted  IAW  AFI  11-401,  Aviation Management. Exception:  Unit commanders may authorize MEP status to personnel assigned or attached to the unit.  (T-2) 3.5.1.  MEP status will not be granted to personnel while on leave status.  (T-2) 3.5.2.  All MEPs require Temporary Duty (TDY) travel orders to specify MEP authorized or a  supporting  letter  from  their  commander  authorizing  MEP  status.    Unit  commanders authorize MEP status  for their  aircrew by placing  a  remark on their TDY orders or a letter stating why the member is traveling as an MEP.  (T-2) 3.5.3.  Unit  members  wanting  to  travel  in  MEP  status  on  non-unit  aircraft  will  have  to coordinate  with  the  PIC  in  charge  of  that  aircraft/mission.    Members  use  their  TDY  orders (with MEP in the remarks) to show their aircrew member/travel status.  (T-2) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 19 3.5.4.  Logging of Flying Time.  MEPs transported that are not C-32B qualified will be listed on the flight authorization in the Remarks section (only); they will not be listed on the AFTO Form  781.    C-32B  aircrew  members  who  are  current  and  qualified  on  the  mission  may  be placed  in  the  aircrew  section  of  the  flight  authorization.    Flight  examiners,  HHQ  personnel and flight surgeons log flying time IAW AFI 11-401, Flight Management.  (T-2) 3.5.5.  Briefings.    The  PIC  or  representative  will  brief  all  MEPs  on  emergency  procedures and egress.  (T-2)  3.5.6.  In order to accommodate training objectives or mission requirements, pilots (including non-current or unqualified pilots) who are authorized to obtain and maintain qualification in the  C-32B  may  occupy  a  pilot's  seat  for  purposes  of  conducting  training  or  accomplishing mission requirements when MEPs are on board the aircraft.  (T-2)  3.6.  Interfly.  Interfly  is  a  temporary  arrangement  between  OG/CCs  (or  equivalent)  to  permit current  and  qualified  aircrew  members  from  one  unit  to  perform  primary  aircrew  duties  on another unit’s aircraft.  NGB/A3 must approve interfly with Regular Air Force  crews IAW AFI 11-401.  Participating aircrews shall use guidelines established by the MAJCOM or as specified in the OPLAN or CONOPS.  Conduct interfly operations as follows:  (T-2) 3.6.1.  OG/CC  (or  equivalent)  may  authorize  interfly  of  aircrews  and/or  aircraft.    Normally interfly should be limited to specific operations, exercises, or special circumstances but may be  used  to  relieve  short-term  qualified  manpower  shortfalls. interfly arrangements may be  found in  command-to-command memorandum  of  agreements (MOA) or letters of agreement (LOA).  (T-2)   Long-term 3.6.1.1.  AFSOC staff personnel or inspection teams are approved for interfly.  (T-2) 3.6.1.2.  645  AESS  personnel  who  perform  depot  level  maintenance  are  approved  for interfly when required.  (T-2) 3.6.2.

Unit  CC/DO shall not  schedule an aircrew member to  fly nor will they perform aircrew duties: 3.7.1.  Anytime  the  crewmember  has  not  obtained  the  appropriate  crew  rest    IAW  AFI  11-202, Vol 3.  (T-2) 3.7.2.  If  any  alcohol  is  consumed  within  12  hours  prior  to  takeoff  (or  assuming  aircraft control for UAS) or if impaired by alcohol or any other intoxicating substance, to include the effects or after-effects. 3.7.3.  Anytime  a  physical  or  psychological  condition  is  suspected  or  known  to  be detrimental  to  the  safe  performance  of  flight  duty.  Consult  a  flight  surgeon  at  the  earliest opportunity. 3.7.4.  While  self-medicating,  except  IAW  the  “Official  Air  Force  Aerospace  Medicine Approved Medications” found in AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards. 3.7.5.  Within 24 hours of compressed gas diving including SCUBA, surface supplied diving, hyperbaric  (compression)  chamber  exposure  or  aircraft  pressurization  checks  (to  below  sea level)  that  exceed  10  minutes  duration  (this  restriction  not  applicable  to  UAS  flight operations)  (T-1).  Exceptions:  Following  Helicopter  Emergency  Egress  Device  System (HEEDS)  training,  aircrew  may  only  fly  within  the  24-hour  window  if  the  aircraft’s maximum  altitude  remains  below  10,000  ft.  MSL.  Air  Force  divers  on  aeronautical  orders will  follow  guidelines  IAW  SS521-AG-PRO-010  U.S.  Navy  Diving  Manual  for  flying  and diving restrictions.  (T-1) 3.7.6.  Within  12  hours  after  completion  of  a  hypobaric  (altitude)  chamber  flight  above 25,000 ft. mean sea level (MSL) (T-1). Personnel may fly as passengers in aircraft during this period provided the planned mission will maintain a cabin altitude of 10,000 ft. MSL or less. For  altitude  chamber  flights  to  a  maximum  altitude  of  25,000  ft.  MSL  or  below,  aircrew members  may  fly  without  restriction  as  crewmembers  or  passengers  if  cabin  altitude  is  not planned to exceed 15,000 ft. MSL (this restriction not applicable to UAS flight operations). There are no restrictions following Reduced Oxygen Breathing Device (ROBD) training. 3.7.7.  Within 72 hours after donating blood, plasma, or bone marrow (T-1). 3.8.  Medical:  Aircrew members must maintain a medical clearance from the flight surgeon to perform  in-flight  duties.   (T-1)  Medical  or dental  treatment  obtained from  any source must be cleared by a flight surgeon prior to reporting for flight duty.  (T-1) 3.8.1.  Use  of  any  medication  or  dietary  supplements  is  governed  by  AFI  48-123  and  as approved  by  a  flight  surgeon.  Aircrew  members  will  not  normally  self-medicate.    Refer  to AFI 11-202, Vol 3 as supplemented for partial list of medications. 3.8.2.  For fatigue countermeasures refer to AFI 11-202, Vol 3, AFSOC SUP. 3.9.  Crew  Rest.  In  addition  to  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  and  applicable  MAJCOM  supplements, comply with the following guidance.  (T-2) 3.9.1.  Do not give crew members less than 12 hours crew rest.  (T-2) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 21 3.9.2.  Crew  members  departing  on  missions  scheduled  to  recover  away  from  home  station should  be  notified  24  hours  before  reporting  for  a  mission.    The  first  12  hours  are  not considered crew rest.  During these first 12 hours, a crew member may perform limited non-flying  duties.    The  second  12  hour  period  is  inviolate.    For  short-notice  mission  tasking  or when a scheduled crew  member is  unable to  fly, crew members may be  given less  than 24 hours  notification  with  unit  CC/DO  approval;  however,  they  will  not  be  given  less  than  12 hours.  (T-1) 3.9.2.1.  For  all  other  missions,  crew  members  will  enter  crew  rest  12  hours  before reporting for the mission.  (T-2) 3.9.3.  Standby crews will be given 12 hours crew rest prior to the earliest anticipated show time.  (T-2) 3.9.4.  Enroute Crew Rest and Ground Time.  (T-3) 3.9.4.1.  Crew  rest  normally  begins  45  minutes  after  final  engine  shutdown.    The  45 minute time period provides crews with time to complete normal post-flight duties. These duties  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  refueling,  uploading  and  downloading  of  cargo, performing maintenance, or completing mission debriefings.  (T-2) 3.9.4.2.  If  any  primary  aircrew  member  must  stay  at  the  aircraft  past  the  45  minute period, crew rest does not begin until post-flight duties are completed.  (T-2) 3.9.4.3.  Minimum  crew  rest  period  is  12  hours.    Crew  rest  is  compulsory  for  aircrew members prior to performing any duties involving aircraft operations and is a minimum of 12 non-duty hours before the Flight Duty Period (FDP) begins (T-2). Crew rest is free time  and  includes  time  for  meals,  transportation,  and  rest.  This  time  must  include  an opportunity  for  at  least  8  hours  of  uninterrupted  sleep.  Crew  rest  period  cannot  begin until  after  the  completion  of  official  duties.    Any  crew  rest  interruptions  must  be  made under  the  most  exceptional  circumstances.    Note:    Refer  to  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3  and MAJCOM Supplement). 3.9.4.4.  A  minimum  17  hour  ground  time  between  engine  shutdown  and  subsequent mission  takeoff  should  normally  be  planned  unless  extended  post  flight  duties  are anticipated.    Note:    Flight  crews  should  be  afforded  crew  rest  times  in  excess  of  the minimum at en route stations, when possible, to give crews the opportunity to overcome the  cumulative  effects  of  fatigue  while  flying  on  several  consecutive  days  or  transiting several time zones.  (T-3) 3.9.4.5.  The PIC may modify normal ground time:  (T-3) 3.9.4.6.  In the interest of safety.  (T-3) 3.9.4.7.  To  no  less  than  12  hours  from  the  start  of  crew  rest  until  mission  reporting. Before  reducing  normal  ground  time  consider  mission  preparation  time,  time  to  load cargo, and other factors particular to the mission. The controlling C2 agency will not ask the PIC to accept less than a normal ground time except in the interest of aircrew/aircraft safety or unusual mission requirements during contingency operations.  (T-2) 3.9.5.  Maintenance personnel are responsible to the  PIC. The PIC will determine how long maintenance personnel  can safely perform  aircraft  recovery  actions. Maintenance personnel must have the opportunity to sleep 8 hours of each 24 hour period.  (T-2) 22 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 3.9.6.  Post-mission crew rest (PMCR) begins upon the final return of an individual to home station and runs continuously until completed.  PMCR must be completed before starting the 12 hour pre-departure crew rest period for a subsequent mission.  A crew member cannot be required to get immunizations, engage in ground training, perform standby or unit duties, or perform any other  activity that would encroach  upon crew rest.   Waiver authority  for post-mission crew rest is the OG/CC (or equivalent).  Waiver requests for post-mission crew rest are  considered  on  a  case  by  case  basis  only  with  the  concurrence  of  the  individual  crew member.  For  missions  exceeding  16  hours  CDT,  1  hour  of  post-mission  crew  rest  will  be provided  for  every  3  hours  away  from  home  station  not  to  exceed  96  hours.    This  is  not applicable  for  missions  scheduled  to  transit  home  station  as  part  of  a  scheduled  continuing mission.  (T-3) 3.10.  Flight Duty Period (FDP).  FDP starts when an aircrew reports for a mission, briefing, or other official duty (show time) and ends when engines are shut down at the end of the mission, mission  leg,  or  a  series  of  missions.    Show  time  for  home  station  departures  is  established  in Chapter  10  of  this  regulation.    For  missions  originating  away  from  home  station,  FDP  begins when  transportation  departs  overnight  lodging.    When  crewmembers  perform  other  official duties  prior  to  fight  related  duties,  FDP  begins  when  reporting  for  the  earlier  duties.    Note:  Waiver  authority  for  Paragraph    3.9  is  the  OG/CC  (or  equivalent)  or  individuals  designated Commander Air Force Special Operations Forces (COMAFSOF).  (T-3) 3.10.1.  Maximum FDP.  (T-3) 3.10.1.1.  The  basic  FDP  is  16  hours  providing  no  mission  events,  pilot  proficiency training or functional check flights (FCF) are accomplished after 12 hours and no AAR is accomplished after 14 hours.  Exception:   If the autopilot is not operational or its use is denied  for  more  than  4  hours  (the  use  of  altitude  hold  does  not  constitute  use  of  the autopilot) the FDP will be 12 hours.  If the autopilot fails after departure, continue to next scheduled stop and then comply with the basic FDP limitations.  (T-3) 3.10.1.2.  The augmented FDP is 24 hours providing no mission events, pilot proficiency training or FCFs are accomplished after 14 hours and no AAR is accomplished after 18 hours.  Exception:  If the autopilot is not operational or its use is denied for more than 8 hours (the use of altitude hold does not constitute use of the autopilot) the FDP will be 16 hours.  (T-3) 3.10.1.3.  When official post-flight duties are anticipated to exceed 2 hours, consideration should be given to reducing FDP to ensure fatigue does not affect the safe completion of those duties.  (T-3)  3.10.1.4.  Alert/Standby  Crews.    For  alert  crews  launched  on  an  as-soon-as-possible basis, FDP begins when the crew is notified of the mission.  For alert crews launched on other than an as-soon-as-possible basis, FDP begins when the crew reports for duty.  (T-3) 3.10.2.  Planning  FDP.      IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  missions  will  be  planned  within  FDP limits.  (T-3) 3.10.2.1.  FDP extensions require OG/CC (or equivalent) approval.  (T-3) 3.10.2.1.1.  All FDP waivers require the PIC’s concurrence.  (T-3) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 23 3.10.3.  FDP length will be based on the mission to be performed.  Once established, a basic FDP will not be changed to an augmented FDP, regardless of crew composition.  (T-3) 3.10.3.1.  The length of FDP will be established by the PIC or the controlling C2 agency prior  to  the  aircrew  entering  crew  rest.    Once  established,  a  basic  FDP  will  not  be extended to an augmented FDP unless the crew is augmented; it is requested by the PIC, and coordinated through the OG/CC (or equivalent).  (T-3) 3.10.4.  Deadhead  time  before  performing  primary  crew  duties  is  considered  FDP.  Crewmembers  may  perform  primary  crew  duties  after  deadheading  if  their  FDP  will  not exceed  the  limitations  specified  in  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3  Table  2.1.    Crewmembers  may deadhead following primary crew duties.  If deadheading following primary crew duties, the FDP  will  not  exceed  24  hours  unless  de-positioning  to  remain  overnight  (RON)/Crew  rest location or home station.  If de-positioning to  RON/Crew rest  location or home station and deadheading time will exceed 24 hrs, SQ CC/DO approval is required.  All other deadhead extensions require OG/CC (or equivalent) approval.  Note:  The intent is to allow the unit to complete time critical missions where available aircrew or aircraft are limited.  Missions will not be routinely planned to utilize this exception.  (T-3) 3.10.5.  FDP  for  flight  examiners  administering  flight  evaluations  and  not  occupying  a primary crew position will not exceed the augmented FDP.  (T-3) 3.10.6.  If  the  aircraft  is  not  capable  of  being  airborne  within  four  hours  of  scheduled departure time, the aircrew will be returned to crew rest or released from the flight.  The unit CC/DO  may  grant  exceptions  at  the  request  of  the  PIC.    This  paragraph  applies  to  all missions, including unit-training missions.  (T-3) 3.11.  Crew  Changes.  Crew  changes  should  not  be  made  immediately  prior  to  performing critical  phases  of  flight  for  non-training  flights.    Normally,  30  minutes  prior  to  initiating  the checklist for an event will allow the new crew member time to get acclimated.  (T-2) 3.12.  Alert  Procedures.  Alert  duty  is  defined  as  any  period  during  which  an  alert  crew  is  on call to perform a specific mission.  The unit CC/DO will determine alert procedures required for missions. Publish unit alerting procedures in  Chapter 10 of this AFI.  Note:   Alert restrictions contained in the AFSOC Supplement to AFI 11-202, Vol 3 are not applicable to 150 SOS crew members.  (T-2) 3.12.1.  IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3 do not give crew members less than 12 hours crew rest.  (T-2) 3.12.1.1.  Pre-mission crew rest is waived for flight surgeons or medical technicians who are on alert duty for urgent aero-medical evacuation missions.  (T-2) 3.12.2.  Alert  personnel  are  those  required  to  be  on  duty  for  the  prompt  execution  of  the mission.  Alert crews will be readily available in a location that allows the crew to meet the required time to launch from notification.  Publish flight authorizations for the alert crew to cover the entire alert tour.  (T-2) 3.12.3.  The  alert  duty  period  will  begin  at  a  scheduled  time  that  is  determined  by  the unit/mission commander.  The unit/mission commander will determine the length of the alert.  Exception:  Once a mission has executed, exercise or real world, there is no limitation on the numbers of alert  duty days.  The crew is  tied to  the mission until  its completion. Changing 24 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 crewmembers during mission execution will be at the discretion of the unit commander.  (T-2) 3.12.4.  Alert Restrictions.  (T-2) 3.12.4.1.  Crews  may  complete  initial  alert  activities  (e.g.,  briefings,  preflight  etc.) without starting their alert FDP.  (T-2) 3.12.4.2.  Alert  crew  members  may  be  scheduled  for  mission  or  office  related  duties  at the discretion of the alert PIC or unit commander without starting their alert FDP.  (T-2) 3.12.4.3.  Alert  crew  members  will  not  accomplish  items  that  may  result  in  a  DNIF  or grounding status.  (T-2) 3.12.4.4.  Limit alert duty period to a maximum of 6 hours and should only be conducted during  normal  duty  hours.    The  alert  duty  period  starts  when  a  crew  member  on  alert shows  for  any  flight  and/or  office  related  duties  and  ends  when  the  flight  and/or  office related duties are complete.  (T-2) 3.12.4.4.1.  Flying the alert crew is authorized with the following restrictions:  (T-2) 3.12.4.4.1.1.  Local  proficiency  flights  to  include  AAR  training  during  daylight hours (night proficiency flights to include AAR training are prohibited).  (T-2) 3.12.4.4.1.2.  Relocation  of  the  alert  aircraft  and  crew.    Relocation  of  the  alert aircraft should take place during daylight hours but may take place after daylight hours with approval from unit CC/DO.  (T-3) 3.12.4.4.1.3.  Limit flying to a maximum of three sorties during a seven day alert tour.  Exception:    The  unit  CC/DO  may  approve  additional  sorties  for  required alert aircraft relocations (weather, airfield closure, etc.).  (T-3) 3.12.4.4.2.  FDP for HHQ directed alert mission will begin when the crew is alerted for the HHQ directed mission.  (T-2) 3.12.5.  If the alert crew is launched and returns with FDP remaining, they may be launched again within the constraints of that crew day.  Numerous circumstances may arise that affect the decision to  replace the alert  crew and  each incident must be evaluated on an individual basis.  The unit commander may reconstitute a new alert crew when the primary alert crew is launched.  The new alert crew will be placed into crew rest and will not perform any duties for  the  first  12  hours.    If  mission  objectives  warrant,  the  new  alert  crew  may  be  launched with  less  than  12  hours  of  pre-alert  crew  rest.  OG/CC  (or  equivalent)  approval  is  required.  (T-3) 3.12.6.  Post  alert  crew  rest  is  not  required  for  alert  repositioning  sorties  (weather,  airfield closure, etc.) accomplished within a 6 hour alert FDP.  (T-3) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 25 Chapter 4 COMMAND OPERATING GUIDELINES 4.1.  Objectives.  A fully mission-capable aircraft is the ultimate objective of the logistics effort.  The  final  responsibility  regarding  equipment  required  for  a  mission  rests  with  the  PIC.    If  one PIC accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission segment without an item or system, this acceptance does not commit that PIC, or a different PIC, to subsequent operations with the same item or system inoperative.  (T-2) 4.2.  Policy.  The  Minimum  Equipment  Listing  (MEL)  is  the  operating  guidelines  and  lists  the equipment  and  systems  considered  essential  for  routine  operations.    Those  items  that  state  a minimum  requirement  and/or  have  no  listed  exceptions  are  grounding  items.    The  PIC  is  the approval  authority  for  operations  with  degraded  equipment  within  the  guidelines  of  the  MEL.  Operating outside of the MEL guidelines requires OG/CC (or equivalent) approval.  Exception:  For MEL items  that permit  flight  but  have  exceeded the MEL  repair interval  or have  extended range  (ER)  restrictions  the  waiver  authority  is  the  unit  CC/DO.    (T-3)    When  the  MEL  repair interval is extended, AFSOC/A3VS will be notified.  (T-2) 4.2.1.  For  operational  missions  where  communications  with  the  appropriate  C2  is  not available, the PIC is the approving authority for operating outside of the MEL guidelines and needs no further approval.  (T-2) 4.2.2.  The PIC is responsible for exercising the necessary judgment to ensure aircraft are not dispatched with multiple items inoperative that may result in an unsafe degradation and/or an undue  increase  in  crew  workload.    The  possibility  of  additional  failures  during  continued operation with inoperative systems or components shall also be considered.  This chapter is not  intended  to  allow  for  continued  operation  of  the  aircraft  for  an  indefinite  period  with systems/subsystems inoperative.  (T-2) 4.3.  Operating Guidelines.  Refer to MEL. 26 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 Chapter 5 AIRLAND OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES 5.1.  Checklists.  C-32B normal checklists are designed as clean-up checklists, and items may be accomplished prior to the checklist being read.  A checklist is not complete until all items have been  accomplished.  Momentary  hesitations  for  coordination  items,  ATC  interruptions,  and deviations specified in the flight manual, etc., are authorized.  (T-2) 5.1.1.  Checklist Inserts.  Approved checklist inserts may be placed in an in-flight guide or at the  end  of  the  checklist.    All  proposed  checklist  inserts  must  have  a  POC.    If  any  crew member has recommendations or changes they should contact the POC.  Submit changes to operations manuals/checklists to AFSOC/A3V for final approval.  Local in-flight guides and inserts  not  affecting  T.O.  procedures  and  regulatory  guidance  may  be  locally  approved  by unit DOV.  Note:  Commercial manuals are considered T.O. guidance.  Additionally, Quick Reference/Recall Hard Cards are authorized.  All changes will parallel procedures outlined in AFI  11-215,  USAF  Flight  Manuals  Program  (FMP)  for  Technical  Orders/manuals.    AF Form 847s will be processed through AFSOC for revision approval.  (T-2) 5.2.  Duty  Station.  A qualified pilot will be in  control of the aircraft at  all times during flight.  Exception:    Under  direct  IP  supervision  (at  a  set  of  flight  controls),  unqualified  pilots  in qualification training and qualified Senior Staff Officers/Supervisory Flying pilots may occupy a pilot  seat.    Refer  to  AFI  11-2C-32B,  Vol  1  for  Senior  Officer/Supervisory  Flying  restrictions.  (T-2) 5.2.1.  Pilots will occupy their assigned stations from takeoff to landing except when duties or  physiological  needs  require  absence  from  their  stations.    Primary  crew  members  will notify the PIC prior to departing and when returning to their assigned duty station.  (T-2) 5.2.2.  Use of the cabin jump seats by passengers is prohibited for takeoff and landing.  (T-1) 5.3.  Flight Deck Entry.  PICs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight deck during all phases of flight.  In all cases, sufficient oxygen sources must be available to meet the requirements of AFI 11-202, Vol 3.  Passengers and observers will not be permitted access to the pilot  or  copilot  position  regardless  of  its  availability.    Note:    Passengers  occupying  the  flight deck  jump  seats  are  there  for  visitation  and  familiarization.    These  seats  will  not  be  used  as primary seating except for unit aircrew and unit maintenance personnel.  (T-2) 5.4.  Takeoff and Landing Policy.  A qualified aircraft commander or higher will occupy either the left or right seat during all takeoffs and landings.   Note:  The designated PIC (A-Code) on the  flight  authorization  is  not  required  to  occupy  a  primary  position,  but  still  retains  overall authority for conduct of the mission.  (T-2) 5.4.1.  Instructor and flight examiner pilots may take off and land from either seat during any conditions.  (T-2) 5.4.2.  Any  pilot  may  takeoff  or  land  from  either  seat  provided  that  an  instructor  pilot, instructor  pilot  candidate  on  initial  or  re-qualification  instructor  evaluation,  or  flight examiner pilot is in the other seat.  (T-2) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 27 5.4.3.  With  no  IP/Evaluator  Pilot  (EP)  on  board  PICs  will  accomplish  all  takeoffs, approaches and landings when:  (T-2) 5.4.3.1.  Actual  emergency  conditions  exist,  unless  specific  conditions  prevent compliance.  (T-2) 5.4.3.2.  Making an actual Instrument Landing System (ILS) Category II or an ILS PRM approach.  (T-2) 5.4.3.3.  Hostile conditions exist.  (T-2) 5.4.3.4.  Operating  to  or  from  airfields  requiring  MAJCOM,  OG/CC  (or  equivalent)  or airfield  related  waivers.    Note:    A  qualified  aircraft  commander  will  land,  taxi,  and takeoff from the left seat at airfields requiring waivers for taxiway or runway dimensions.  (T-2) 5.5.  Landing Gear and Flap Operation In-Flight: 5.5.1.  The landing gear will normally be operated by the pilot not flying (PNF).  Actuate the landing gear only after commanded by the pilot flying (PF).  Prior to actuation of the landing gear, the PNF will acknowledge the command by repeating it.  (T-2) 5.5.2.  The  flaps  will  normally  be  operated  by  the  PNF.    Actuate  the  flaps  only  after command by the PF.  Prior to actuation of the flaps; the PNF will acknowledge the command by repeating it.  (T-2) 5.6.  Use  of  Outside  Observers.  When  available,  use  a  crew  member  to  assist  in  outside clearing during arrivals, departures and taxi operations.  (T-2) 5.7.  Seat Belts: 5.7.1.  Crew members occupying primary crew positions  will have seat  belts fastened  at  all times in-flight, unless crew duties dictate otherwise.  (T-2) 5.7.2.  All crew members will be seated with seat belts and shoulder harnesses (if applicable) fastened during takeoff, landing, and AAR operations, unless crew duties dictate otherwise.  Crew  members  performing  instructor  or  flight  examiner  duties  are  exempt  from  seat  belt requirements  unless  they  occupy  a  primary  crew  station;  however,  a  seat  with  an  operable seat belt will be available.  (T-2) 5.7.3.  All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt. Use of seat belts will be as directed by the PIC and the flight manual.  (T-2) 5.8.  Aircraft  Lighting:  Aircraft  lighting  will  be  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3, MAJCOM supplement, host-nation rules, theater SPINS, and this AFI.  (T-0) 5.8.1.  Use  taxi  lights  (as  installed)  during  all  taxi  operations.    Use  landing  lights/runway turnoff  lights  at  night  in  unlighted  areas.    Use  all  external  lighting  any  time  the  aircraft  is below 18,000 feet unless reflections cause pilot distractions in instrument conditions.  (T-2) 5.8.2.  Anti-collision lights  must be on from  takeoff to  landing.  (T-0)  Refer to  the aircraft MEL for operations with inoperative anti-collision lights. 5.9.  Portable Electronic Devices.  Comply with AFI 11-202, Vol 3 as supplemented.  (T-1) 28 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 5.10.  Tobacco Use.  Tobacco use is prohibited on board Department of Defense (DoD) aircraft per AFI 40-102, Tobacco use in the Air Force.  (T-2) 5.11.  Advisory Calls.  Mandatory advisory calls are IAW the Flight Crew Operations Manuals (FCOM) Volume 1 and the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).  (T-2) 5.12.  Communications Policy: 5.12.1.  Sterile  Cockpit.    Limit  conversation  to  that  essential  for  crew  coordination  and mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, and any flight below 10,000 feet MSL (except cruise).  (T-2) 5.12.2.  Communications During Takeoff.   If an unsafe condition occurs during takeoff and before  the  computed  V1  speed  is  reached,  either  pilot  observing  the  condition  will  give  a brief description of the problem.  The PIC will then make the decision to reject or continue the  takeoff.    If  a  reject  decision  is  made,  the  PIC  will  state  “REJECT”  and  the  PF  will discontinue  the  takeoff  in  accordance  with  the  C-32B  flight  manuals.    (T-1)  Non-cockpit crew  members  noting  a  safety  of  flight  condition  will  notify  the  PIC  by  giving  a  brief description of the problem; the decision to reject or continue the takeoff will be made by the PIC.    Note:    PIC  expectations  in  the  event  of  a  rejected  take-off  (RTO)  should  be  covered during the “Takeoff Briefing.”  (T-2) 5.12.3.  Aircraft  Interphone.    Pilots  and  AMSS  should  monitor  aircraft  interphone  at  all times.  Loadmasters are required to monitor interphone during AAR events or as directed by the  PIC.    Primary  crew  members  will  notify  the  PIC  before  going  off  headset  and  advise when back on headset.  (T-2) 5.12.4.  Classified  interphone  or  radio  transmissions  will  be  recorded  on  the  cockpit  voice recorder if it is operating.  Ensure the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) tape is erased after each flight when classified was discussed.  (T-2) 5.12.5.  Do  not  discuss  classified  information  on  the  interphone  during  radio  transmissions.  (T-2) 5.12.6.  Passengers  will  monitor  interphone  or  radio  transmissions  only  when  specifically approved by the PIC.  The PIC/AMSS will brief communications policy  to  these personnel prior to flight.  The PIC/AMSS must ensure no one monitors classified information they are not cleared for, or transmits classified information via non-secure communications.  (T-2) 5.12.7.  Command Radios.  The PNF normally makes all radio calls. The pilot operating the command radios will inform the crew when the primary radio is changed.  (T-2) 5.12.8.  A  flight  deck  crew  member  will  monitor  guard  regardless  of  primary  radio. Exception:    AAR  radio  usage  will  be  as  briefed  and  in  accordance  with  Chapter  8  of  this AFI.  (T-2) 5.12.9.  A  pilot  will  inform  the  crew  when  the  aircraft  is  in  an  other  than  normal configuration (for example, one engine inoperative). Not required on training sorties.  (T-2) 5.12.10.  One  pilot  should  record  and  will  acknowledge  all  air  traffic  control  (ATC) clearances.    The  AMSS,  when  available,  will  also  record  and  monitor  the  read-back.    This includes all transmissions pertaining to  ATC instructions involving departure, en route, and approach  procedures.    Disregard  this  procedure  when  ATC  instructions  require  immediate AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 29 execution  or  when  such  action  interferes  with  completion  of  more  important  duties  or physiological needs.  (T-2) 5.12.11.  The AMSS will be utilized to provide communications with base operations, fixed based operators, and other ground personnel.  (T-2) 5.12.12.  The pilot not flying the aircraft will notify the other pilot when altitude deviates 100 feet from the desired altitude if no attempt is being made to correct the deviation. Any crew member seeing a variation of more than 200 feet from planned altitude or potential terrain or obstruction clearance problems will notify the pilot immediately.  (T-2) 5.12.13.  Crew Resource Management (CRM) Assertive Statement “Time Out":  (T-2) 5.12.13.1.  "Time Out" is the common assertive statement for use by all crew members.  The use of "Time Out" will:  (T-2) 5.12.13.2.  Provide  a  clear  warning  sign  of  a  deviation  or  loss  of  situational  awareness.  (T-2) 5.12.13.3.  Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.  (T-2) 5.12.13.4.  Notify  all  crew  members  that  someone  sees  the  aircraft  or  crew  departing from  established  guidelines, is  simply uncomfortable with the developing conditions.  (T-2) the  briefed  scenario,  or that  someone 5.12.13.5.  As soon as possible after a "Time Out" has been called, the aircrew will take the following actions:  (T-2) 5.12.13.6.  Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft.  (T-2) 5.12.13.7.  The initiating crew member will voice his or her concerns to the crew.  (T-2) 5.12.13.8.  The  PIC  will  provide  all  other  crew  members  with  the  opportunity  to  voice inputs relative to the stated concerns.  (T-2) 5.12.13.9.  After  considering  all  inputs,  the  PIC  will  direct  the  aircrew  to  continue  the current  course  of  action  or  direct  a  new  course  of  action.    Note:    The  PIC  is  the  final decision authority.  (T-2) 5.13.  Transportation  of  Military  Working  Dogs.  Transporting  military  working  dogs  on aircraft will be coordinated through unit OG/CC (or equivalent) for approval with C2 agencies.  Other pets or animals are normally prohibited, but may be moved according to DoD 4515.13R, Air Transport Eligibility.  (T-3) 5.14.  Alcoholic Beverages.  MAJCOM/A3 may authorize the dispensing of alcoholic beverages to passengers.  (T-2) 5.15.  Runway, Taxiway and Airfield Requirements. Table 5.1.  Minimum Runway Length (T-3).

Normal  Operations  (takeoff).    Boeing  Onboard  Performance  Tool  (OPT)  or MAJCOM  approved,  computer  generated  airfield  analysis  will  be  used  to  the  maximum extent possible for determining takeoff data. If airfield analysis is not available, use the Flight Planning  and  Performance  Manual  (FPPM)  or  the  Quick  Reference  Handbook  (QRH)  to determine the AFM runway length required for takeoff.  (T-2) 5.15.1.1.  Do not attempt takeoff if the runway available is less than the greater value of the AFM required runway length or 5,000 feet.  (T-2) 5.15.2.  Normal  Operations  (landing).    OPT  generated  landing  data  or  the  FPPM/QRH  will be used to determine the AFM runway length required for landing. When using un-factored data a 15% safety margin will be added (N/A for emergency aircraft).  (T-2) 5.15.2.1.  Do not attempt landing if the runway available is less than the greater value of AFM runway length required for landing + 15% (for the runway conditions that exist or are anticipated at the estimated time of arrival (ETA) or 5,000 feet.  Note:  The “Normal Configuration Landing Distance” chart from the FPPM/QRH should be used to determine the AFM runway length required.  (N/A for computer generated data).  (T-3) 5.15.3.  Waiver  Authority:    If  operationally  necessary,  the  OG/CC  (or  equivalent)  may approve use of runways shorter than 5,000 feet, but never less than AFM takeoff and landing distance.  Approval requires careful evaluation of aircraft and crew capabilities. If operations are approved, a current and qualified PIC, instructor or flight examiner will make the takeoff and/or landing from the left seat.  (T-3) 5.15.4.  If  takeoff/departure  end  overruns  are  available,  (stressed  or  authorized  for  normal operations), they may be used to increase the runway available for takeoff/landing if needed.

Taxiways less than 75 feet (23 meters) wide should be given additional consideration in pre-mission planning ORM and must be covered in the aircrew briefing prior to arrival.  (T-3) 3.  Use of taxiways between 59 and 49 feet wide requires notification to the OG/CC (or equivalent) prior to arrival at the airfield.  If prior notification is not possible, notify as soon as practical.  Taxiway width may not be waived to less than 49 feet (15 meters).  (T-3) 4.  C-32B aircraft require fillets when turning from one 50 foot wide taxiway to another 50 foot wide taxiway.  Turning from one 50 foot to another 50 foot without fillets is prohibited due to the probability of the aircraft departing the paved surface.  (T-2) 5.15.5.  Takeoff or  Landing Over Raised Arresting Cables.   The  following  guidance covers BAK  9,  12,  and  13  (Navy  designation  E-28)  arresting  cables,  it  does  not  include  BAK  14 recessed arresting cables:  (T-2) 5.15.5.1.  Do  not  land  on  a  raised  arresting  cable,  damage  may  occur  to  the  cable  or aircraft.  (T-2) 5.15.5.2.  If  the  aircraft  lands  before  a  raised  arresting  cable  and  rolls  over  it,  the  flight crew should contact the tower to have the cable inspected (This does not include rolling over a cable at normal taxi speeds).  (T-2) 5.15.5.3.  Do  not  takeoff  or  land  over  a  raised  arresting  cable  that  has  been  reported  as slack, loose, or improperly rigged by Notices to Airmen (NOTAM), Automated Terminal Information Service (ATIS), ATC, etc.  (T-2) 5.15.6.  Aircrews,  mission  planners  and  mission  C2  will  use  the  AMC  Airfield  Suitability and  Analysis  Branch  for  all  questions  pertaining  to  airfield  weight  bearing  and  suitability prior to all off-station operations.  (T-2) 5.15.6.1.  PICs  will  not  make  an  approach  and  landing  into  an  airfield  requiring certification  by  the  Headquarters  Air  Mobility  Command  (AMC)  Airfield  Suitability Report,  unless  they  have  previously  operated  into  that  airfield  as  a  pilot,  copilot,  or observer, or have reviewed the airfield certification  briefing or audio  visual  program  (if available)  within  the  last  14  days.    The  OG/CC  (or  equivalent)  may  waive  the  airfield certification requirement.  (T-3) 5.15.6.2.  Airfield suitability waivers must be approved by MAJCOM/A3.  (T-2) 5.15.7.  Crash, Fire, Rescue (CFR) Requirements:  (T-3) 5.15.7.1.  At  USAF  active  flying  bases,  local  base  instructions  determine  CFR requirements.    At  other  locations,  if  local  services  are  not  available  or  practical,  the OG/CC (or equivalent) may authorize operations without CFR.  (T-3) 5.16.  Wind  Restrictions.  Airfields  will  be  considered  unusable  for  takeoff  and  landing  when crosswinds  (including  gusts)  are  greater  than  established  in  Table  5.3.    These  limitations  are valid for all engines operating and one engine inoperative conditions.  (T-2) 32 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 Table 5.3.  Wind Restrictions  (T-3) Flight Phase Runway Condition Crosswind Component (knots)     Takeoff Landing Dry Wet Standing Water/Slush Snow - No Melting* Ice - No Melting* Dry Wet 40 25 15 20 15 28 28 20 28 17     * Takeoff or landing on untreated snow and ice should only be attempted when no melting is present. Standing Water/Slush Snow - No Melting * Ice - No Melting* Note:  Reduce crosswind guidelines by 5 knots on wet or contaminated runways whenever asymmetric reverse thrust is used. Note:  Winds are measured at 33 feet (10 m) tower height and apply for runways 148 feet  (45m) or greater in width. Note:  When the reported depth of contamination is less than .12 inches (3mm) consider the runway wet for all takeoff/landing considerations. 5.16.1.  Maximum wind any direction is 50 knots for takeoff and landing.  (T-3) 5.16.2.  Waiver  Authority:    If  operationally  necessary,  the  OG/CC  (or  equivalent)  may approve  operations  with  winds  up  to  the  AFM  limitations.    Approval  requires  careful evaluation  of  aircraft  and  crew  capabilities.  If  operations  are  approved,  a  current  and qualified PIC, instructor or flight examiner will make the takeoff and/or landing from the left seat.  (T-3) 5.16.3.  For  other  wind  restrictions  refer  to  the  Limitations  section  of  the  Flight  Crew Operations Manual, Volume 1 and Chapter 9 of this AFI.  (T-2) 5.17.  Runway Condition Reading (RCR). 5.17.1.  During  landing  on  wet  runways  or  runways  contaminated  with  ice,  snow,  slush  or standing  water;  crews  will  use  pilot  reports  (PIREPS)  and  the  physical  description  of  the runway surface as the primary means to determine which category of “good”, “medium”, or “poor” is appropriate when calculating the runway distance required for landing. 5.17.2.  RCR provides additional information and should be considered by the aircrew prior to determining runway suitability for landing. However, when using RCR, crews should keep in  mind  that  there  is  no  direct  correlation  between  RCR  and  the  descriptive  terms  “good”, “medium”,  “poor”,  and  “nil”  used  in  pilot  braking  action  reports.    Chapter  6  of  the  Flight Crew  Training  Manual  (FCTM)  provides  additional  guidance  on  using  RCR  to  evaluate braking action. AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 33 5.17.3.  The following information is provided to assist crews in making the most informed decision when using RCR. Table 5.4.  Braking Action vs. Braking Action to be used from the (QRH) Reported RCR Good Medium Poor 18-23 12-17 6-11 Reported Runway Surface Condition (RSC) Wet Standing Water/Snow Icy Reported Braking Action Good Fair Poor 5.17.3.1.  When  the  RCR  is  reported  as  5  or  less  or  the  braking  action  is  reported  as “Nil”, landing is not recommended.  (T-3) 5.17.3.2.  When operating on runways partially covered  with  snow or ice, computations should be based on the reported RCR for the cleared portion of the runway.  To ensure proper  takeoff  performance  in  the  event  of  an  engine  failure,  the  runway  should  be cleared to allow for maximum VMCG offset (C-32B is 25 feet plus main gear offset).  If your required VMCG offset either side of centerline is not cleared to the reported RCR, then the RCR of the unclear portion, up to  your required offset, will be used for takeoff data  computations.    Note:    RCR  Reporting.  Technical  Order  (TO)  33-1-23  directs  that RCR  information  be  obtained  only  within  20  feet  of  the  runway  centerline.    Only  the average RCR is reported. Many portions of the runway (laterally and longitudinally) may have a significantly lower RCR than the value reported. 5.17.4.  No reported runway conditions.  If pilot braking action reports, RCR or RSC are not available, flight crews are to consider a runway surface as wet when there is sufficient water on the surface to cause reflective glare or when rain is falling.  For runways contaminated by slush, standing water, snow or ice, the PIC will determine the anticipated braking action.  (T-3)  5.18.  Aircraft  Taxi  Obstruction  Clearance  Criteria  and  Foreign  Object  Damage  (FOD) Avoidance. 5.18.1.  Without  wing  walkers,  avoid  taxi  obstructions  by  at  least  25  feet.    With  wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 10 feet.  Exception:  Aircraft at home station may delete wing walker restriction if IAW AFI 11-218, all restrictions are complied with.  (T-2) 5.18.2.  When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers.  If wing walkers are unavailable,  de-plane  one  or  more  crew  members  to  maintain  obstruction  clearance  and provide  marshalling.    Use  AFI  11-218  signals.    The  PIC  should  use  marshallers,  wing walkers, deplaned crew members, or a crew member positioned at a door or window to act as an  observer  while  maneuvering  on  narrow  taxiways.    During  night  taxi  operations, marshallers should have an illuminated wand in each hand.   If wands are not available, use flashlights,  chemical  lights  or  any  other  device  that  will  be  visible  from  the  cockpit.  Observers  should  be  in  a  position  to  observe  wing  walkers  at  all  times  (through  door  or windows) and communicate to the pilot.  (T-2) 34 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 5.18.3.  FOD  Avoidance.    Make  every  effort  to  minimize  the  potential  for  engine  FOD.  Crews should:  (T-2) 5.18.3.1.  Carefully review airfield layout during mission planning.  Be familiar with taxi routes, turn requirements and areas for potential FOD.  (T-2) 5.18.3.2.  Confirm  that taxi  routes have been swept.    If a taxi  route has not  been swept, consider taxiing via an alternate route.  (T-2) 5.18.3.3.  Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.  (T-2) 5.18.3.4.  If it is necessary to accomplish a 180-degree turn on a narrow runway the turn should be accomplished at an intersection of a link taxiway or at a designated turn around pad.  (T-2) 5.18.3.5.  Avoid  (when  possible)  taxi  operations  that  would  position  a  wing  mounted engine  over  an  unprepared  or  un-swept  surface.    If  it  becomes  absolutely  necessary  to position  a  wing  mounted  engine  over  an  unprepared  or  un-swept  surface,  the  engine should be left in idle (to the maximum extent possible) until the engine is back over an improved surface.  (T-2) 5.18.3.5.1.  Consider increasing power on the remaining engine.  (T-2) 5.19.  Fuel  Requirements.  This  paragraph requirements.  (T-2) implements the standard  minimum fuel 5.19.1.  As a minimum, required ramp  fuel  will  consist  of all fuel  required for engine start, taxi,  auxiliary  power  unit  (APU)  operation,  takeoff,  climb,  cruise,  en  route  reserves, alternate/missed approach (if required), descent, approach, and landing.  (T-2) 5.19.2.  Required  fuel  at  destination.  Plan  to  land  at  the  destination  with  a  minimum  of  50 minutes  of  usable  fuel  onboard.  This  amount  will  be  computed  by  a  MAJCOM  approved computer flight plan (CFP). If a CFP is not available, plan to land with a minimum of 6,000 lbs.  (T-2) 5.19.3.  Alternate Fuel.  As a minimum, alternate fuel will include fuel for a flight from the intended  destination  to  the  alternate  aerodrome  at  optimum  altitude  and  long  range  cruise speed.    When  holding  is  required,  in  lieu  of  an  alternate  at  a  remote  or  island  destination, compute  holding  for  2  hours.    A  remote  or  island  destination  is  defined  as  any  aerodrome, which,  due  to  its  unique  geographic  location,  offers  no  suitable  alternate  (civil  or  military) within  2  hours  flying  time.    The  forecast  weather  at  the  remote  or  island  destination  must meet the criteria listed in Chapter 6 of this AFI.  (T-2) 5.19.4.  Required  Ramp  Fuel for  Extended-range  Twin-engine  Operational Performance  Standards  (ETOPS).  Block-to-block  fuel  must  be  greater  than  or  equal  to:  fuel  required  to  fly  to  the  ETP,  experience  a  simultaneous  engine  failure  and  loss  of  cabin pressure,  and  proceed  from  the  ETP  to  a  recovery  field  at  10,000  feet  using  single  engine cruise procedures.   This  amount must also  include extra ETOPS fuel  requirements listed in Chapter 6 of this AFI.  (T-3) 5.20.  Intersection  Takeoffs.  The  decision  to  make  intersection  takeoffs  rests  solely  with  the PIC.    Base  performance  computations  on  the  runway  remaining  at  the  point  the  takeoff  is initiated.  (T-2) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 35 5.21.  Land and Hold Short (LAHSO) Operations.  PICs shall not accept nor request LAHSO approach  clearances.    Advance  ATC  notification  may  be  required  for  proper  sequencing  of aircraft and preclude delays.  (T-2) 5.22.  Stop-and-Go Landings.  Stop-and-Go landings are not authorized.  (T-2) 5.23.  Reduced  Power  Operations.  Reduced power operations  are intended to  prolong engine service life.  Takeoffs will be accomplished using reduced power unless operational or training requirements dictate otherwise.  (T-3) 5.24.  Engine Out Takeoffs.  Engine out takeoffs require a MAJCOM/A3 waiver.  (T-2) 5.25.  Engines  Running  On/Offload  (ERO).  Do  not  use  ERO  procedures  when  explosive cargo  is  involved  unless  authorized  by  the  exercise  operation  order,  contingency  air  tasking orders or OG/CC (or equivalent).  (T-3) 5.25.1.  The  ERO  procedures  in  this  paragraph  may  be  used  for  any  mix  of  personnel  or cargo.  Personnel  will  onload  or  offload  via  the  air-stairs.    PICs  will  assess  prevailing weather, lighting, and parking location to ensure a safe operation.  (T-3) 5.25.2.  General Procedures:  (T-3) 5.25.2.1.  PICs  will  brief  crewmembers  on  the  intended  ERO  operation,  emphasizing specific crewmember duties.  (T-3) 5.25.2.2.  The parking brake will be set and one pilot will monitor brakes, interphone, and radio.  (T-3) 5.25.2.3.  Operate engines at idle thrust.  (T-3) 5.25.2.4.  Turn wing illumination lights on during night ERO.  (T-3) 5.25.2.5.  Complete  passenger  and  cargo  manifests,  crew  lists  and  weight  and  balance form for the subsequent sortie.  Note:   If the aircraft is departing empty, the weight and balance form is not required.  (T-3) 5.25.2.6.  Resume  taxi  after  the  door  warning  light  is  out  and  when  the  loadmaster  has verbally acknowledged that the aircraft is ready for taxiing.  CAUTION:  Due to hazards involved (i.e., jet blast, proximity to engines) only hand transferable items of cargo may be on or off loaded during ERO operations.   CAUTION:    Door 1L may be opened and airstairs  extended  with  the  left  engine  running.    The  PIC  or  designated  representative (normally the loadmaster) must ensure the hazards involved are understood by the crew and passengers.  (T-3) 5.25.2.7.  During  enplaning  or  deplaning,  station  a  crew  member  (normally  the loadmaster) at the bottom of the airstairs as an aircraft security and safety monitor.  (T-3) 5.25.2.8.  Enplaning  or  deplaning  passengers  will  be  escorted  by  a  crew  member.  Brief these personnel  to  remain clear of hazardous areas (see aircraft flight  manual). Deplane passengers  before  cargo  and  enplane  after  cargo  unless  cargo  size,  location  or  mission dictates otherwise.  (T-3) 5.25.2.9.  The loadmaster will direct all onload and offload operations.  (T-3) 36 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 5.25.2.10.  ERO  for  crew  changes  during  local  training  missions  is  authorized.    Keep ERO  for  crew  changes  to  the  absolute  minimum  necessary  to  accomplish  the  mission.  (T-3) 5.26.  Emergency Airlift: 5.26.1.  Use these procedures for emergency airlift of personnel for humanitarian reasons or from areas faced with enemy siege, hostile fire, or when directed by the MAJCOM.  Airlift can  be  accomplished  without  the  use  of  individual  seats  or  safety  belts  only  when  more personnel than seats are available.  (T-2) 5.26.2.  The number of personnel seated within the cabin will vary depending on individual size. If possible seat personnel in rows facing forward and restrain with straps placed across the  aircraft  floor.  Secure  the  straps  to  tie-down  rings  positioned  in  the  most  outboard  seat track(s).  (T-2) 5.26.3.  If time allows, personal effects or baggage may be loaded on the aircraft. However, this may reduce the amount of personnel space available. Figure 5.1.  C-32B Runway Width Requirements (T-3).  AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 37 Figure 5.2.

Guard and Reserve Facilities.  On missions to CONUS civil airports with a  military  facility  (ANG/AFRC)  capable  of  providing  support,  use  the  military facility; however, there are exceptions. If the mission will arrive or depart outside the normal  operating hours  of the military facility (nights,  weekends, or holidays) use a civilian  facility  (terminal,  FBO  ramp,  etc.)  provided  you  can  arrange  the  necessary support.  If  the  using  agency  requests  use  of  a  civilian  facility  in  preference  to  an available  military  facility,  use  the  civilian  facility.  In  general,  avoid  requiring ANG/AFRC  units  to  work  overtime  in  support  of  C-32B  missions  unless  the  using agency  has  a  specific  need  to  use  the  military  facility  or  suitable  support  cannot  be obtained from civilian sources.  (T-3) 6.3.1.17.2.  Contract  Servicing  Agents.  Use  the  government  fuel  contractor  unless you cannot obtain the required services. Government FBO contract fuel vendors can be at www.airseacard.com.    If  possible,  use  the  approved  government  credit  card  if  you must purchase fuel from other than the designated government contract vendor.  (T-3) Instrument  Flight  Rules (IFR)  Supplement  or found in the 6.3.1.17.3.  Aircraft  Security.    C-32B  aircraft  are  exempt  from  the  Global  Decision and  Support  System  (GDSS)  requirement  for  RAVENS.  RAVENS  may  be  used  if conditions  warrant  and  requested  by  the  unit.    Aircraft  security  is  ultimately  the responsibility of the PIC.  When using non-military fields, the PIC will work with the FBO, airport security or DAO directed host nation security to ensure that the aircraft is  adequately  protected.    If  the  PIC  is  not  satisfied  that  adequate  aircraft  security  is available, notify the responsible C2 agency for resolution.  (T-3) 6.4.  Aircrew  Publications  Requirements.  Unit  DOV  will  maintain  current  C-32B  aircraft flight manuals, performance manuals, abbreviated checklists, and hardcards on board the aircraft.  Aircraft  FLIP  will  be  maintained  by  personnel  assigned  by  the  unit  commander.    AFSOC authorizes  E-pubs  in  lieu  of  paper  manuals  for  all  products  except  for  approach  plates,  SIDs, STARS  and  abbreviated  checklists.    Refer  to  Chapter  10  of  this  instruction  for  local  paper/E-pubs guidance.  (T-2) 6.4.1.  EFB (Electronic Flight Bag) / IPAD Requirements.  Comply with AFI 11-202, Vol 3 AFSOC Sup Attachment 8.  (T-1) Section 6B—Predeparture 6.5.  Airfield  Certification.  All  crew members  will review available Jeppesen or NGA airport qualification products (or other approved means) for Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR)  certification  airfields  prior  to  departure.    In  addition,  review  all  restrictions  for  a particular  airfield.    Contact  MAJCOM  Airfield  Suitability  and  Analysis  Branch  or  the  Airfield Manager directly for all questions pertaining to airfield weight bearing and suitability.  Airfield suitability  waivers  must  be  coordinated  through  unit  Stan/Eval  up  to  MAJCOM  Stan/Eval  for approval.  The OG/CC (or equivalent) may waive the airfield certification requirement.  (T-3) 6.6.  Aircrew Intelligence Briefing.  Prior to leaving home station on OCONUS missions, crews should receive an intelligence briefing that will emphasize terrorist, enemy, and friendly political and military development in the area in which they will be flying.  Additionally, theater SPINS and  ATO  procedures  should  be  reviewed  if  applicable.    Aircrews  should  report  information  of 42 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 possible  intelligence  value  to  the  local  intelligence  officers  (if  available)  at  the  completion  of each sortie.   If no local  intelligence personnel  are available, aircrews will  debrief home station intelligence personnel at the completion of the mission.  (T-3)  6.7.  Flight  Crew  Information  File  (FCIF).  Review  Volume  I,  part  B  and  C,  of  the  FCIF before all missions.  (T-2) 6.7.1.  If material has been added to the FCIF since the last review, sign off the latest FCIF item  number  in  PEX  (Patriot  Excalibur).    If  PEX  is  inoperative,  comply  with  locally developed procedures in Chapter 10 of this instruction.  (T-2) 6.7.2.  Crew members delinquent in FCIF review and joining a mission en route, will receive an  FCIF  update  from  their  primary  aircrew  member  counterpart  on  that  mission.  Instructor pilots flying with general officers are responsible for briefing appropriate FCIF items.  (T-2) 6.7.3.  Crew  members  not  assigned  or  attached  to  the  unit  will  certify  FCIF  review  by entering  the  last  FCIF  number  and  their  initials  beside  their  name  on  the  file  copy  of  the flight authorization or their ACM orders. Initials will be in pen.  (T-2) 6.7.4.  Units are responsible for ensuring TDY aircrews receive newly released FCIFs which may result in mission impact.  (T-2)  6.8.  Mission  Kits.  Prior  to  departure,  the  PIC,  or  a  designated  representative,  will  ensure  a current  mission  kit  is  aboard  the  aircraft.    The  kit  will  contain,  but  is  not  limited  to,  the  items listed in Figure 6.1.  Maintain sufficient quantities of forms and documents to cover time well in excess of the scheduled mission length.  (T-2) Table 6.1.  Aircrew Mission Kit.

Briefing Requirements. 6.9.1.  Pre-Mission  Briefings.    Briefings  should  be  clear,  concise,  and  designed  to  provide only mission essential information.  Supplement and shorten briefings with visual aids when practical.  Avoid  needless  repetition  of  published  procedures.    Schedule  briefings  after considering the particular mission, crew rest, and other pertinent factors.  Aircrew members must  be  provided  all  applicable  information  available  to  ensure  complete  and  professional aircrew planning.  Crew members will not fly unless they attend the crew briefings for their mission.    Exceptions:    When  mission  requirements  dictate,  PICs  may  excuse  certain  crew members from the briefing.  The PIC will ensure that those personnel receive a face-to-face briefing prior to engine start.  (T-2) 6.9.1.1.  Crew  members  joining  a  mission  en  route  will  receive  a  face-to-face  briefing prior to assuming primary duties.  (T-2) 6.9.2.  Weather Briefings.  See AFI 11-202, Vol 3 requirements.  Obtain a briefing on current weather,  trends,  and  forecasts  for  the  proposed  route,  destination,  and  alternates.    The weather briefing should be documented on a DD 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing.  Exception:  Verbal weather briefings are acceptable for local area training missions.  See Chapter 10 of this  instruction  for  locally  developed  weather  briefing  requirements.    Authorized  weather sources, in priority order, include:   (T-2) 6.9.2.1.  Regional Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) or MAJCOM-approved source.  (Note:    Contact  information  for  the  servicing  OWS  and/or  installation  weather  flight  is located  in  Section  C  of  the  FIH.

Other  US  Government  (USG)  Weather  Facilities/Services  (i.e.,  National Weather Service, FAA).  (T-2)   44 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 6.9.2.5.  Foreign Civil Weather Service (Use only when DOD military resources or USG services are unavailable in OCONUS locations).  (T-2) 6.9.3.  NOTAM  information  is  permitted  from  the  following  sources;  US  Military  services, any  FAA-approved  source  (Jeppesen,  Flight  Service,  etc.,),  or  any  host  nation  civil  or military source.  (T-2) 6.9.4.  Hazardous  Cargo  Briefing.    Prior  to  acceptance  of  hazardous  materials,  the  PIC  or designated  representative  should  be  furnished  a  cargo  briefing  and  appropriate  forms.    The PIC  will  ensure  that  all  crew  members  thoroughly  understand  mission  requirements  and procedures governing the hazardous materials being airlifted.  (T-2) 6.9.5.  Pilot  In  Command  Briefing.    Give  this  briefing  before  the  first  flight  of  the  mission and for subsequent flights when crew member substitutions are made or operating procedures change from the original briefing.  (T-2) 6.9.6.  Departure  and  Arrival  Briefings.    As  a  minimum  the  following  topics  need  to  be covered.  (T-2) 6.9.6.1.  Departure.  (T-2) 6.9.6.1.1.  RTO and Emergency Return.  (T-2) 6.9.6.1.2.  Emergency Level off Altitude and Jeppesen Special Departure Procedures (SDP) (if applicable).  (T-2) 6.9.6.1.3.  Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA).  (T-2) 6.9.6.1.4.  Standard Instrument Departure (SID)/Departure Instructions.  (T-2) 6.9.6.1.5.  Any Non-standard procedures that are anticipated.  (T-2) 6.9.6.2.  Arrival.  Conduct the arrival brief IAW the “Normal Procedures” (NP) section of the FCOM, Volume 1.  (T-2) 6.9.7.  En  Route  Briefings.    The  PIC  will  conduct  a  briefing  at  the  end  of  each  flight  duty period  prior  to  entering  crew  rest,  and  prior  to  the  first  sortie  of  each  flight  duty  period.  Applicable  crew  members  or  a  designated  representative  for  each  crew  specialty  should  be present  but  crew  members  may  be  excused  from  the  briefings  at  the  discretion  of  the  PIC.  PICs should keep the passenger POCs informed of mission specifics, changes, problems, etc.  (T-2) 6.9.7.1.  Briefings  at  the  end  of  each  flight  duty  period  should  include  crew  contact procedures during crew rest, departure time, crew reporting time and place, transportation arrangements, planned fuel load, uniform changes, and cabin service requirements.  (T-2) 6.9.7.2.  Briefings  prior  to  the  first  sortie  of  each  flight  duty  period  should  include  as  a minimum, brief specific mission details for that day's sortie(s), CRM, and the ORM level and mitigating factors for the mission.  Complete this briefing prior to engine start.  (T-2) 6.9.7.3.  Passenger Briefings.  The PIC or designated representative will brief passengers on all flights in accordance with the applicable passenger video or briefing checklist.  (T-2) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 45 6.10.  Call Signs.  Use voice call sign listing (VCSL) or as specified in mission directives except local training missions.  Use standard call signs for local area training missions.  (T-2) 6.11.  Instrument  Flight  Rules.  Conduct  flight  operations  under  IFR  to  the  maximum  extent possible without unacceptable mission degradation. Exception:  On local training flights, Visual Flight Rules (VFR), VFR terminal area procedures, and visual patterns should be reviewed and practiced to ensure aircrew VFR flight proficiency and knowledge of VFR procedures and rules are maintained.  (T-1) 6.11.1.  During VFR operations, aircraft will utilize radar advisory service to  the maximum extent possible.  (T-2) 6.12.  Flight Data Verification. 6.12.1.  Computer  Flight  Plan  (CFP)  Usage.    MAJCOM  approved  (Jeppesen,  Milplanner, Portable  Flight  Planning  Software  (PFPS),  (Combat)  CFPS,  etc.)  flight  planning  programs are  authorized  for  performance,  navigation,  and  climatic  data,  including  en  route  wind information  for  C-32B  aircraft.    If  computer  flight  plans  are  used,  each  mission  segment should utilize current wind data if available.  (T-2) 6.12.2.  Aircrews may manually compute flight plans if a CFP is not available.  (T-2) 6.12.3.  Regardless  of  whether  a  flight  plan  is  prepared  by  the  aircrew  or  is  furnished  by another  source,  the  PIC  will  verify  routes  and  flight  altitudes  to  ensure  proper  terrain clearance and hazardous weather avoidance.  (T-2) 6.12.4.  Aircrews  will  verify  diplomatically-cleared  routing  and  fuel  computations  for accuracy prior to departure.  (T-2)  6.12.5.  Takeoff and Landing Data.  The use of a MAJCOM approved (Jeppesen, Boeing On-Board Performance Tool (OPT), etc.) airfield analysis program is authorized for determining takeoff and landing data.  Speeds for takeoff and landing will be computed by tabulated data or the aircraft Flight Management Computer (FMC) as applicable.  Takeoff and landing data should be independently verified by both pilots.  (T-2) 6.13.  Departure Planning: 6.13.1.  Gross Weight.  Ensure that the aircraft does not exceed the maximum gross weight, zero fuel weight, or center of gravity limitations specified in the AFM.  Gross weight may be further restricted by operating conditions.  (T-2) 6.13.2.  For  the  use  of  Non-standard  Takeoff  Minimums  refer  to  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3  and applicable supplements.  (T-1) 6.13.3.  Authorized  IFR  Departure  Methods.      Comply  with  AFMAN  11-217  and  AFI  11-202, Vol 3 IFR departure methods.  (T-1) 6.13.3.1.  Obtain  and  use  information  or  publications  from  US  Government  (USG) sources  as  first  preference.    (T-0)    Non-USG  terminal  procedures  are  authorized  after  a Terminal   Only MAJCOM/A3,  after  a  TERPS  review,  may  approve  a  host  nation  or  commercially produced SID for use in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC).  (T-2) Instrument  Procedures IAW  AFI  11-230. (TERPS) review 46 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 6.13.3.2.  Special Departure Procedures (SDPs).  AFSOC authorizes the use of SDPs for C-32B aircraft.  SDPs utilize worldwide obstacle database criteria to provide OEI escape routing.    Warning:    SDPs  may  not  ensure  obstacle/terrain  clearance  if  the  aircraft  is unable  to  comply  with  the  specified  escape  routing.    At  airfields  where  obstacle/terrain clearance is a factor, departure procedures from liftoff to the minimum en route altitude must be reviewed and included in the takeoff briefing.  Note:  Use of SDPs as alternate departure routing (no emergency) is not authorized.  (T-2) 6.13.3.3.  VFR  Departures.    VFR  departures  are  authorized  when  required  for  mission accomplishment.  The weather at takeoff must permit a VFR climb to an IFR MEA, an appropriate IFR cruising altitude, or an altitude where an IFR clearance can be obtained.  Note:    In  no  case  will  VFR  departures  be  flown  in  lieu  of  OEI  obstacle  clearance planning or use of IFR departure procedures.  (T-1) 6.14.  Obstacle Clearance Planning: 6.14.1.  Obstacle  Identification Surface (OIS).  Obstacle identification for SID purposes are those objects that penetrate an OIS of 40:1 (152 feet per nautical mile (nm)).  Calculation of the OIS on a SID continues until the SID reaches a MEA or until the SID terminates.  Climb gradients of 200 feet per nm, or published climb  gradients, will provide at least 48 feet per nm clearance above all obstacles that do not penetrate the OIS.  The PIC must be aware and thoroughly  brief  the  crew  on  all  obstacles  along  the  departure  flight  path.    Note:    Civilian SIDs do not depict the controlling obstacle that the climb gradient is based on. 6.14.2.  Boeing  OPT  and  MAJCOM  approved  computer  generated  Airfield  Ops  Data  are sufficient to meet or exceed all obstacle clearance requirements for USAF aircraft. 6.14.3.  If  OPT  and  Airfield  Ops  Data  are  not  available,  before  flying  any  departure,  the aircrew will:  (T-2) 6.14.3.1.  Use  the  FPPM  or  QRH  to  determine  the  max  takeoff  gross  weight  for  the runway to be used for the atmospheric conditions that exist or are anticipated for the time of  departure.    Review  appropriate  terrain  charts  (if  available),  the  ASRR,  instrument approaches,  area  charts,  departure  plates,  etc.  to  determine  the  controlling  obstacle(s).  WARNING:    When  using  the  FPPM/QRH  to  determine  takeoff  data,  crews  must  be aware  that  there  is  no  weight  penalty  to  account  for  climb  degradation  during  turning departures and it is extremely difficult to identify all obstacles that may affect the flight path.    If  terrain/obstacles  are  a  factor,  max  power  takeoffs  and  climbs  should  be  used until reaching MEA.  (T-2) 6.15.  Takeoff Minimums and Departure Alternates. 6.15.1.  Weather Minimums for Takeoff.  (T-2) 6.15.1.1.  Takeoff  is  permitted  when  weather  is  below  the  published  landing  minimums with the following visibility requirements:  (T-2) 6.15.1.1.1.  Takeoff  Runway  Visual  Range  (RVR)  is  1,600  feet  or  greater  (with  no RVR readout, use visibility ¼ mile or greater).  (T-2) 6.15.1.1.2.  Takeoff with RVR minima below 1600 RVR is not authorized unless the runways are equipped with centerline lights, visible runway centerline markings, and AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 47 two  operative  transmissometers.    (T-1)    Consecutive  transmissometers  must  report 1,000 RVR or higher.  (T-2) 6.15.2.  When  weather  is  below  approach  and  landing  minimums  (ceiling  or  visibility)  a departure  alternate  is  required.    Do  not  use  CAT  II  minimums  to  determine  if  a  departure alternate  is  required.    In  the  absence  of  RVR  readouts,  reported  visibility  will  be  no  lower than 1/2 SM.  (T-2) 6.15.3.  Suitability  of  Departure  Alternates.    When  a  departure  alternate  is  required,  the aircraft must be capable of maintaining minimum IFR altitude, IAW the basic instruction, to the alternate using OEI performance criteria. To qualify as a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions: 6.15.3.1.  For  an  alternate  within  30  minutes  flying  time,  the  existing  weather  must  be equal to or better than the lowest compatible approach minima (includes IMC-approved SCAs) and forecast to remain so until 1 hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2,400), or; (T-2) 6.15.3.2.  For an alternate within two hours flying time, the existing weather must  be at least  500-1  above  the  lowest  compatible  published  approach  minima  (includes  IMC-approved  SCAs),  but  not  less  than  600-2  for  a  precision  approach  or  800-2  for  a  non-precision approach, and forecast to remain so for one hour after ETA at the alternate.  (T-2) 6.15.4.  Airfield and Aircraft Approach Capability.  For IFR departures, the approach facility upon which weather minimums are based must be operational at the departure and alternate airports and the necessary aircraft approach equipment must also be operational.  (T-2) 6.16.  Destination  Requirements  (for  filing  purposes).  The  forecast  destination  weather  will be according to AFI 11-202, Vol 3 (T-1) and the following: 6.16.1.  File two alternates when:  (T-2) 6.16.1.1.  The forecast weather is less than required minimums for the lowest compatible approach.  (T-2) 6.16.1.2.  The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected for RCR.  (T-2) 6.16.2.  File  an  alternate,  regardless  of  forecast  weather,  when  the  destination  aerodrome  is outside the 48 conterminous states.  (T-2) 6.16.3.  When  filing  to  a  remote  or  island  destination,  aircrews  will  use  2  hours  of  holding fuel (in lieu of an alternate and 50 minutes holding fuel).  A remote or island destination is defined  as  any  aerodrome  which,  due  to  its  unique  geographic  location,  offers  no  suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time.  The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following criteria:  (T-2) 6.16.3.1.  The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter.  (T-2) 6.16.3.2.  The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published minimums  for  an  available  published  approach  (excluding  radar  approaches),  for  ETA plus 2 hours.  (T-2) 48 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 6.17.  Destination and AAR Alternates. 6.17.1.  Choose  alternates  that  best  meet  mission  conditions  and  conserve  fuel.    When terminal forecasts are marginal, if possible avoid picking alternates within the same weather system.    Selected  alternates  should  not  be  restricted  by  FLIP,  the  FCG,  or  diplomatic clearances  and  should  be  compatible  with  the  mission  load.    A  weather  alternate  does  not need to be capable of providing en route maintenance.  The PIC retains final authority in the choice of the alternate;  however, selection by support agencies should be used if the above criteria are met and the aircraft has already been serviced.  (T-2) 6.18.  Adverse Weather Planning. 6.18.1.  Icing.    The  Air  Force  Weather  Agency  Technical  Note  (AFWA/TN  98/002) Meteorological  Techniques,  states  that  freezing  drizzle  is  equivalent  to  moderate  icing  and freezing  rain  is  equivalent  to  severe  icing.    Prolonged  flight  (cruise)  in  areas  of  forecast  or reported severe icing (freezing rain) is prohibited.  (T-2) 6.18.1.1.  C-32B  aircrews  should  use  the  MAJCOM  approved  De/Anti-Icing  Hardcard for procedures and to establish holdover times.  (T-2) 6.18.2.  Thunderstorms.   During  flight,  use any  available means to  avoid  thunderstorms by:  (T-2) 6.18.2.1.  Minimum of:  20 nm at or above FL 230.  (T-2) 6.18.2.2.  Minimum of:  10 nm below FL 230.  (T-2) 6.18.3.  Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.  If unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2,000 feet, you must avoid them by using the above criteria.  Note:  Aircraft damage may occur 20 miles or more  from  any  thunderstorms.    Aircrews  must  familiarize  themselves  with  information  on thunderstorm development and hazards.  Refer to AFH 11-203, Vol 1, Weather for Aircrews.  (T-2) 6.18.4.  In  order  to  minimize  exposure  to  thunderstorm  hazards  when  approaching  or departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:  (T-2) 6.18.4.1.  Attempt to maintain Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC).  (T-2) 6.18.4.2.  Attempt to maintain at least 5 nm separation from heavy rain showers.   Note:  Approaches or departures may be accomplished with thunderstorms in the vicinity of the airport.    The  thunderstorms  must  not  be  producing  any  hazardous  conditions  (such  as hail, lightning, strong winds, gusts fronts, wind shear, or microbursts) at the airport, and must not be forecast or observed to be moving in the direction of the route of flight  (to include the planned missed approach corridor, if applicable).  (T-2) 6.18.5.  Altimeter Temperature Corrections.  Aircrews performing instrument approaches and landings  at  locations  where  temperatures  are  32°F/0°C  or  below  will  apply  temperature corrections IAW the Flight Information Handbook and AFI 11-202, Vol 3.  (T-1) 6.18.6.  Turbulence.    Flights  into  areas  of  forecast  or  reported  severe  turbulence  are prohibited.  Note:  Turbulence classification is specific to the size and weight of the aircraft experiencing  the  conditions.    Reported  severe  turbulence  from  aircraft  smaller  than  the  C-32B may or may not be valid.  The PIC should attempt to ascertain the source of the report AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 49 and then use their best judgment on how to proceed.  If this information is not available, the report must be considered valid and the restriction of Paragraph  6.18.6 of this AFI applies.  (T-2) 6.18.6.1.  Do  not  fly  into  an  area  of  known  or  forecast  moderate  or  greater  mountain wave turbulence.  (T-2) 6.19.  Fuel  Planning.  Use  the  CFP,  FPPM  or  QRH  for  fuel  planning.    Flying  at  long-range cruise (approx .80M) is the most conservative method, and therefore this method is encouraged.  However,  PICs  may  elect  to  fly  at  other  speeds  deemed  appropriate  for  the  mission.    The “recommended”  altitude  from  the  FMC  is  the  most  economical  based  on  two  engines,  gross weight,  target  speed,  forecast  cruise  winds  and  temperature.    Therefore,  the  aircraft  should  be flown within 2,000 feet of this altitude (unless the mission dictates other altitudes).  Step climbs should be used if available.  (T-2) 6.19.1.  Add Extra Fuel:  (T-2) 6.19.1.1.  When  fuel  is  unavailable  at  en  route  stops;  when  compressed  ground  times during single day multi sortie missions preclude refueling at each en route stop; or when en route refueling will delay or be detrimental to mission accomplishment.  (T-2) 6.19.1.2.  When  passengers  or  patients  are  aboard,  to  recover  at  a  suitable  airfield  from the ETP at 10,000 feet MSL in the event of unpressurized flight.  (T-2) 6.19.1.3.  When  Category  II  operations  are  anticipated  (total  must  include  fuel  for  en route decent, approach, missed approach, en route fuel to alternate, and approach fuel at alternate).  (T-2) 6.19.1.4.  When required by the CFP for extended range operations.  (T-2) 6.19.2.  Fuel  Conservation.    Aircrew  and  mission  planners  will  manage  fuel  as  a  limited commodity  and  precious  resource.    Fuel  optimization  will  be  considered  throughout  all phases of mission planning and execution.  Excessive ramp and recovery fuel adds to aircraft gross  weight  and  increases  fuel  consumption.    Do  not  ferry  extra  fuel  beyond  optimum requirements for safe mission accomplishment and training objectives.  Aircrews and mission planners  will  optimize  flight  plans  and  flight  routings  for  fuel  efficiency.    In-flight procedures such as climb or descent profiles and power settings should also be considered for efficient  fuel  usage.    Aircrews  should  employ  the  following  aviation  fuel  optimization measures  without jeopardizing  mission/training accomplishment.  (T-2) compromising flight safety  or 6.19.2.1.

Notify the PIC when excessive topside baggage/cargo precludes safe stowage.  (T-2) 56 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 6.37.2.  The LM should notify the cockpit crew that the cabin is secure prior to being seated for  takeoff  or  landing.    The  cockpit  crew  should  confirm  the  cabin  security  report  prior  to takeoff and landing.  (T-3) Section 6E—Enroute 6.38.  Flight Progress. 6.38.1.  Operations  in  International/Territorial  Airspace.    US  military  aircraft  and  DoD personnel entering another nation to conduct US government business therein must have the approval of the foreign government concerned to enter their airspace.  Foreign clearances for US international air operations are obtained through US officials known as Defense Attaché Officers  (DAOs).    Refer  to  FLIP  GP  for  international  strait  passage,  archipelagic  sea  lane passage, procedures to follow if intercepted, and other foreign sovereignty issues. 6.38.1.1.  There  are  essentially  two  types  of  airspace:    international  airspace  and territorial airspace.  International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states territorial  seas.  Military aircraft operate in  such areas free of interference or control by the coastal state.  Territorial airspace includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic waters,  inland  waters,  and  land  territory  and  is  sovereign  airspace.    Overflight  may  be conducted in such areas only with the consent of the sovereign country. 6.38.1.2.  In  accordance  with  international  law,  the  US  recognizes  sea  claims  up  to  12 nautical  miles.    Diplomatic  constraints  and/or  a  lack  of  diplomatic  clearances  usually result  in  missions  operating  in  international  airspace.    Because  of  this,  it  is  imperative sufficient information be provided far enough in advance to allow compliance with FCG requirements  established  by  the  countries  concerned.    The  US  does  not  normally recognize  territorial  claims  beyond  12  nautical  miles;  however,  specific  guidance  from certain US authorities may establish limits, which differ from the standard. 6.38.1.3.  Flight  Information  Region  (FIR).    A  FIR  is  defined  as  an  area  of  airspace within which flight information and related services are provided.  A FIR does not reflect international  borders  or  sovereign  airspace.    Aircraft  may  operate  within  an  established FIR without approval of the adjacent country, provided the PIC avoids flight in sovereign airspace. 6.38.1.4.  Aircrews  on  a  flight  plan  route,  which  takes  them  from  international  airspace into territorial airspace for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not amend entry point(s).  (T-2) 6.38.1.5.  Safe  Passage  violations  of  foreign  sovereignty  result  from  unauthorized  or improper entry or departure of aircraft.  Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace (12 nm from sovereign landmass) for which a clearance has not been duly requested and granted through diplomatic channels. 6.38.1.6.  Air  traffic  control  agencies  are  not  vested  with  authority  to  grant  diplomatic clearances  for  penetration  of  sovereign  airspace  where  prior  clearance  is  required  from the  respective  country.    Aircraft  clearances  are  obtained  through  diplomatic  channels only. AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 57 6.38.1.7.  In the event air traffic control agencies challenge the validity of a flight routing or  attempt  to  negate  existing  clearances,  pilots  must  evaluate  the  circumstances.    The normal response will be to attempt to advise the air traffic control agency that the aircraft will  continue  to  the  planned  destination  as  cleared  in  international  airspace.    The  key phrase is “in international airspace.” Safety of flight is paramount in determining mission continuation.  Under no circumstances should aircrews construe a clearance which routes their  mission  over  sovereign  airspace  which  was  not  approved  through  diplomatic channels prior to mission departure, as being valid authorization. 6.38.1.8.  Aircrews  operating  missions  requiring  unique  or  specially  developed  routing will normally be briefed at home station, or the onload location but must be briefed prior to performing the critical portion of the mission.  (T-2) 6.39.  Navigational Capabilities. 6.39.1.  Oceanic  and  Reduced  Visual  Separation  Minimums  (RVSM)  operations.    C-32B aircraft  and  aircrews  are  RVSM  compliant.    For  all  normal  oceanic  operations  refer  to applicable  FLIP,  FAA  publications,  MAJCOM  approved  Oceanic  Hardcard  and  the Supplement section (QS) of the QRH. 6.39.1.1.  For  a  list  of  required  aircraft  equipment  and  systems  for  entry  into  RVSM airspace reference General Planning, Chapter 5 and FLIP AP/2. 6.39.1.2.  Document  (in  the  aircraft  forms)  malfunctions  or  failures  of  RVSM  required equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet RVSM tolerances.  (T-2) 6.39.1.3.  Contingency Operations.  After entering RVSM airspace the pilot should notify ATC  of  contingencies  (aircraft  system  failures,  weather  conditions)  which  affect  the ability to maintain the current flight level and coordinate a plan of action.  Contingency procedures  for  specific  regions  and  areas  are  located  in  the  applicable  AP  series publications webpage:  http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/air_traffic_services/rvsm/documentation/. documentation RVSM and on the FAA 6.39.2.  Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace.  Airspace where RNP is applied is considered special qualification airspace.  Both the operator and the specific aircraft type must  be  approved  for  operations  in  these  areas.    C-32B  aircraft  are  approved  for  RNP operations.  The following are RNP requirements.  (T-2) 6.39.2.1.  Preflight  Procedures.    Review  maintenance  logs  to  ascertain  status  of  RNP Equipment.  (T-2) 6.39.2.2.  Enroute.  At least two long range navigation systems certified for RNP must be operational  at  the  oceanic  entry  point.    Periodic  crosschecks  will  be  accomplished  to identify  navigation  errors  and  prevent  inadvertent  deviation  from  ATC  cleared  routes.  Advise  ATC  of  the  deterioration  or  failure  of  navigation  equipment  below  navigation performance requirements and coordinate appropriate actions.  (T-2) 6.39.2.3.  Document  (in  the  aircraft  forms)  malfunctions  or  failures  of  RNP  required equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet RNP tolerances.  (T-2) 6.39.3.  North Atlantic minimum navigation performance specification (MNPS) airspace and US West Coast and Hawaii route system.  (T-2) 58 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 6.39.3.1.  North  Atlantic  Oceanic  airspace.    Pilots  will  follow  the  procedures  written  in the  latest  version  of  the  MNPS  manual.    The  MNPS  manual  is  produced  by  the  North Atlantic Systems Planning Group (NAT SPG) which does not have the authority to direct crew  actions,  hence  the  use  of  the  word  “should”  throughout  the  document.    However, where  the  MNPS  manual  uses  “should,”  crews  will  interpret  this  as  “shall.”  DoD  Area Planning procedures will be followed only if they do not conflict with the MNPS manual.  (T-2) 6.39.3.2.  Northern Pacific Oceanic airspace.  Pilots will follow the procedures written in the FAA Alaska or Pacific Supplement.  DoD Area Planning procedures will be followed only if they do not conflict with these Supplements.  (T-2) 6.39.3.3.  C-32B  aircraft  and  aircrews  are  certified  for  use  of  minimum  navigation performance specification (MNPS) airspace.  (T-2) 6.39.3.4.  Compliance with MNPS standards (FLIP AP/2) is mandatory.  (T-2) 6.40.  Communications  Instructions  for  Reporting  Vital  Intelligence  Sightings  (CIRVIS) and  Other  Reports.  Report  all  vital  intelligence  sightings  from  aircraft  as  indicated  in  FLIP planning or FLIP En route Supplement.  (T-2) 6.40.1.  In-Flight  harassment  or  hostile  action  against  C-32B  aircraft.    Aircraft  subjected  to harassment  or  hostile  action  by  foreign  aircraft  will  immediately  contact  the  DAO  at  the applicable  American  Embassy.    Include  aircraft  nationality,  type,  insignia,  or  any  other identifying  features;  note  position,  heading,  time,  speed  when  harassed,  and  the  type  of harassment.  (T-2) 6.40.2.  Other incidents will be reported as indicated in AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting.  (T-2) 6.41.  In-flight  Meals.  The  pilot  in  command  and  copilot  will  not  consume  in-flight  meals within  90  minutes  of  each  other,  before  or  during  flight,  if  the  meals  were  procured  from  the same source and consist of the same menu.  (T-2) 6.42.  Communications.  Make all communications IAW FLIP or as directed by the controlling agency.  (T-2) 6.42.1.  High  Frequency  (HF)  Communications.    Confine  message  traffic  to  essential operational  matters.    Perform  an  HF  radio  ground  check  prior  to  takeoff  (time  permitting) when  the  use  of  HF  radio  may  be  required  for  ATC  or  C2  communications.    Establish  HF contact before going out of Very High Frequency (VHF)/UHF range.  If unable to establish HF  contact  with  the  controlling  HF  station  and  an  alternate  means  of  relay  of  ATC information in oceanic areas is not available refer to the appropriate AP series for guidance.  (T-2) 6.43.  In-flight Emergency Procedures.  Report deviations from directives that occur as a result of an emergency IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3, and this instruction.  (T-2) 6.43.1.  Notification  of  Controlling  Agencies.    As  soon  as  practical  after  completing  the aircraft emergency action checklist, furnish the controlling agency and appropriate command and  control  center  with  a  description  and  extent  of  the  difficulty,  assistance  required, intentions, and any further pertinent information.  (T-2) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 59 6.43.2.  Turnaround  Procedures.    When  a  turnaround  is  necessary,  use  procedures  in  FLIP.  Maintain VFR, reverse course, climb or descend to a VFR altitude or flight level and request ATC  clearance.    If  unable  to  maintain  VFR,  obtain  an  ATC  clearance  before  reversing course.  A turnaround under IFR conditions, without ATC approval, will be made only after a thorough evaluation of the seriousness of the emergency, general traffic density, and known traffic operating in the immediate area.  Normally, a climb or descent (with minimum change in  altitude)  to  a  VFR  altitude  or  flight  level  would  result  in  minimum  exposure  to  other aircraft, if a turnaround is required.  (T-2) 6.44.  Medical  Assistance.  When  a  person  aboard  the  aircraft  requires  medical  care,  the  PIC will inform the station of next intended landing in sufficient time so medical personnel may meet the aircraft.  The request will include the individual’s sex, approximate age, and the nature of the medical problem.  (T-2) 6.45.  Weather Forecasts. 6.45.1.  The PIC is responsible for obtaining destination weather prior to descent.  (T-2) 6.45.2.  If  a  military  weather  source  is  not  available,  the  PIC  will  obtain  updated  weather information  from  other  sources  according  to  Paragraph  6.9.2  and  Paragraph  13.5.    This includes,  but  is  not  limited  to  Aeronautical  Radio  Communications  Addressing  Reporting System,  web  based  weather  information  via  High  Speed  Data  (HSD)  and  civilian  or  host nation weather services.  (T-2) 6.45.3.  The  ATC  system  can  provide  weather  information  to  en  route  aircraft  on  a  time permitting  basis.    Note:    The  ARTCCs  have  a  limited  capability  to  provide  weather information to en route aircraft within CONUS. 6.45.3.1.  Significant Meteorological Advisory (SIGMET) advisories will be transmitted from  the  servicing  ATC  unit.    Crews  will  consider  all  SIGMETs  valid  for  their  aircraft until verified as not applicable with a military METRO service.  (T-2) 6.46.  Diversions.  Notify the airfield selected for an emergency diversion as soon as possible to allow  maximum  time  to  prepare  the  required  assistance  or  services.    C2  will  assist  the  PIC  as necessary in notifying the appropriate agencies.  (T-2) 6.46.1.  Over-Flying  Scheduled  Refueling  Stops.    Before  offering  to  over  fly  scheduled refueling  stops,  the  PIC  must  consider  all  consequences  that  may  arise.    As  a  minimum, coordination with the unit CC/DO, the contact ground support, and final arrival airport must be considered.  Notify C2 as soon as possible if this option will be utilized.  (T-3) Section 6F—Arrival 6.47.  Crew  Coordination.  The  pilot  flying  the  approach  will  brief  the  crew  on  the  descent, approach, and landing IAW the flight manual.  (T-1)  The other pilot will monitor the approach and  report  any  deviations  from  prescribed  procedures.    Crew  members  will  confine  their activities  to  aircraft  operation,  descent  or  approach  monitoring  and  checklist  accomplishment from  the initial  descent point to block in.  Crew members should not deviate from  these duties except for in-flight emergencies.  (T-2)  60 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 6.48.  Instrument  Approach  Minimums.  The  C-32B  is  normally  a  category  "C"  aircraft  for straight-in  approaches  and  a  category  D  aircraft  for  circling.    If  approach  speed  is  higher  than 140 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), use category "D" minimums.  (T-2) 6.49.  Changes  to  Weather  During  Arrivals.  If  the  reported  weather  decreases  below minimums after starting a descent, receiving radar vectors for an approach, or established on any segment  of  an  approach  prior  to  the  missed  approach  point  (MAP),  the  approach  may  be continued  to  the  MAP  and  either  execute  a  missed  approach  or  continue  to  land  if  following approach minimums IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3 conditions are met: 6.49.1.  Descent Below DH/DA/MDA. Do not descend below DH/DA/MDA until sufficient visual  reference  with  the  runway  environment  has  been  established  and  in  a  position  to execute a safe landing.  (T-0) 6.49.2.  Descent  Below  100  ft.  Do  not  descend  below  100  ft.  above  the  threshold  elevation (THRE) or touchdown zone elevation (TDZE) using the approach lights as a reference unless the red termination bars or the red side row bars are visible and identifiable (N/A on CAT III approaches).  (T-0) 6.50.  Precision Approach Minima. 6.50.1.  Visibility  only.    Pilots  flying  straight  in  approaches  may  start  the  approach  (to include  en  route  descent)  if  the  existing  visibility  is  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  published visibility minimums.  (T-0) 6.50.2.  Ceiling  and  Visibility.    Pilots  flying  circling  approaches  may  start  the  approach  (to include en route descent) if the existing ceiling and visibility are greater than or equal to the published minimums.  (T-0) 6.50.3.  Height Above Touchdown (HAT).  The Category I ILS or Precision Approach Radar (PAR) decision height will provide a HAT of at least 200 feet.  For category (CAT)  II  ILS approaches, use the lowest  published radar  altitude that will provide a  HAT of  at  least  100 feet.  (T-2) 6.50.4.  Visibility.  For PAR approaches IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3  MAJCOMs may authorize Category I Instrument Landing System (ILS) approaches to less than 2400 RVR at locations without  Touchdown  Zone/Centerline  Lighting  (TDZ/CL)  (or  when  such  system  is inoperative) provided the approach is flown using guidance from an approved flight director, heads-up  display,  or  coupled  to  an  autopilot  flown  to  a  Decision  Altitude  (DA).    (T-1)    In addition  to  MAJCOM  approval,  authorization  must  be  stated  on  the  instrument  approach procedure  (IAP)  or  be  published  in  the  inoperative  components  or  visual  aids  table  of  the TPP.  (T-0) 6.50.4.1.  Category I (1800 RVR or greater). Touchdown zone RVR must be equal to or greater than the specified minimums on the IAP.  (T-0) 6.50.4.2.  Category  II  (1200  to  less  than  1800  RVR).  Touchdown  zone  RVR  must  be equal to or greater than the specified minimums on the IAP.  (T-0) 6.51.  Circling Approaches.  For circling approaches, minimum descent altitude (MDA) will be as published for aircraft category.  If the minimums are not published by category, the minimum altitude will be no lower than the value indicated below, plus the published airport elevation.  (T-2) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 61 6.51.1.  Category C-500 feet - 1 1/2 miles.  (T-2) 6.51.2.  Category D-600 feet - 2 miles.  (T-2) 6.52.  Instrument Approach Procedures: 6.52.1.  Fly  a  precision  approach  at  night  and  during  marginal  weather.    If  a  precision approach  is  not  available,  fly  any  available  approved  instrument  approach.    On  training  or evaluation  flights  pilots  may  fly  non-precision  approaches  or  VFR  traffic  patterns  to accomplish required training and evaluation requirements.  (T-2) 6.52.2.  Auto landings are authorized for Category I (Cat I) or Cat II ILS approaches.  (T-2) 6.52.3.  RNAV, Global Positioning System (GPS) and RNAV/(GPS) Instrument Departures, Arrival  and Approaches.  C-32B aircrews are authorized to  fly GPS and RNAV instrument departures,  arrivals  and  approaches  day  or  night,  IMC  or  VMC.    Comply  with  procedures IAW  AFI 11-202, Vol 3  and  the  QS  section  of  the  QRH.    Aircraft  must  have  required navigation  performance  (RNP)  as  published  on  the  IAP  procedure  being  flown.    The  PNF shall  monitor  lateral  cross  track,  vertical  velocity  trends  and  report  any  EICAS  limiting malfunctions  to  the  PF.    The  PF  shall  execute  a  missed  approach  if  excessive  deviations occur. 6.52.4.  Equipment.    Aircraft  must  have  the  appropriate  level  of  ANP  available  IAW  the operations manual procedures prior to initiating the approach.  IAP notes such as “Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)/DME RNP 0.3 N/A” or “GPS Required” state that GPS signal and aircraft equipment must be operational to start the approach.  For aircraft where the MEL does not allow the approach, or if the required approach ANP is not available, the approach shall not be flown.  (T-2) 6.53.  Alternate  Flight  Publications.  The  following  publications  are  authorized  if  acceptable DoD FLIP products are not available:  (T-2) 6.53.1.  United  States  Department  of  Transportation  National  Aeronautical  Charting  Office (NACO).  (T-2) 6.53.2.  MAJCOM TERPS approved Jeppesen and Host Nation FLIP.  (T-2) 6.54.  CAT  II  Procedures.  In addition to this AFI aircrews should reference AFMAN 11-217, Instrument Procedures, Chapter 19, the AFM and the MAJCOM approved hardcard for all CAT II procedures and restrictions.  Comply with QRH “Required Category II Airborne Equipment” table for required aircraft equipment.  (T-2) 6.54.1.  CAT II restrictions.  (T-2) 6.54.1.1.  Both  pilots  must  be CAT II  current  and qualified (for training exceptions, see Chapter 9 of this AFI).  (T-2) 6.54.1.2.  When using visibility only the aircraft must have enough fuel for the approach, missed approach and flight to the alternate, and to arrive at the alternate with the required reserves.  (T-2)  6.54.1.3.  CAT  II  approaches  without  a  radio  altimeter  (RA)  setting  for  DH  are  not authorized.    “RA/NA”  denotes  irregular  terrain  changes  that  affect  the  ability  to accurately set RA.  (T-2) 62 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 6.54.1.4.  CAT II minimums are based on a HAT no lower than 100 feet.  (T-2) 6.54.1.5.  The minimum CAT II RVR is 1,200.  (T-2) 6.54.1.6.  The maximum  crosswind  is 25 knots  for autoland, and 10 knots for  a manual landing.    Note:    Actual  CAT  II  approaches  should  always  be  accomplished  coupled.  Approaches  may  be  accomplished  manually  if  the  autopilot(s)  is/are  unreliable  or inoperative.  If “No Autoland” is annunciated on the ASA or if accomplishing a No ASA approach, a manual landing must be accomplished.  (T-2) 6.54.1.7.  As a minimum, the following airfield equipment must be operational:  (T-2) 6.54.1.7.1.  Approach Lights.  (T-2) 6.54.1.7.2.  Runway centerline lighting.  (T-2) 6.54.1.7.3.  High intensity runway lights or touchdown zone lights.  (T-2) 6.54.1.7.4.  Touchdown  zone  and  either  mid  or transmissometers.  (T-2) rollout (advisory  only) 6.54.1.7.5.  ILS far field monitor.  (T-2) 6.54.1.7.6.  Sequenced flashers.  (T-2) 6.55.  Radio Altimeter Procedures. 6.55.1.  Takeoff.    Set  the  radio  altimeter  as  briefed,  if  no  value  is  specified,  set  the  radio altimeter for the anticipated approach HAT/HAA for an emergency return.  (T-2) 6.55.2.  Approach/Landing.  Set the radio altimeters to the HAT/HAA for the approach being flown.    If  arriving  via  a  VFR  traffic  pattern  and  not  using  an  instrument  approach  as  a backup, set the radio altimeter to 300 ft.  (T-2) 6.56.  Wake  Turbulence  Avoidance.  Pilots  must  exercise  the  discipline  necessary  to  ensure wake turbulence avoidance criteria are observed during flight operations.  Acceptance of visual or  contact  approach  clearance  or  instructions  to  follow  an  aircraft  is  acknowledgment  that  the pilot will maintain a safe interval for wake turbulence avoidance.  (T-2) 6.56.1.  For  VFR  traffic  patterns  behind  larger  aircraft,  follow  "Vortex  Avoidance Procedures" in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).  (T-2) 6.56.2.  For  takeoff  or  landing  behind  larger  jets  that  execute  a  low  approach,  missed approach, or touch-and-go landing, ensure at least 2 minutes separation.  (T-2) 6.57.  Brake Cooling Procedures. 6.57.1.  Takeoff.    Takeoffs  are  authorized  following  full  stop  landings  provided  the  ground time is greater than or equal to the time required by the recommended brake cooling schedule chart  from  the  FPPM/QRH.    CAUTION:    Takeoff  with  greater  than  ambient  brake temperatures may increase stopping distances in the event of an RTO.  PICs should take this into  consideration  when  determining  the  minimum  turn  around  time  if  the  required  takeoff distance  is  close  to  the  actual  runway  available.    Note:    The  brakes  reach  their  maximum temperature after approximately 15 minutes, and the crews should take this time/temperature lag  into  account.    Refer  to  Brake  Cooling  Schedule  in  the  QRH/FPPM  after  a  full-stop landing if subsequent take-off is less than 15 minutes.  (T-2) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 63 6.57.2.  Landing.  Full stop landings will be delayed until the Brake Temperature Monitoring System  (BTMS)  reads  ≤  “2.”  While  full  stop  landings  may  be  accomplished  with  an indication of “2”, this should not be considered the norm.  (T-2) Section 6G—POSTFLIGHT 6.58.  Impoundment.  If  an  aircraft  is  involved  in  a  serious  in-flight  incident,  the  PIC  should impound  the  aircraft  immediately  after  landing  and  contact  the  MAJCOM  C2  or  appropriate controlling agency for further instructions.  (T-2) 6.59.  Maintenance.  The PIC will complete the appropriate maintenance forms.  (T-2) 6.59.1.  Immediately  after  arrival,  the  PIC  and  other  pertinent  crew  members  debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, avionics equipment, and all installed special equipment.  The PIC will ensure a thorough maintenance debrief is provided (if necessary) to the controlling agency prior to entering crew rest.  (T-2) Section 6H—MISCELLANEOUS PROCEDURES 6.60.  Border  Clearance.  Comply  with  the  Border  Clearance  Guide  and  this  AFI  for  border clearance procedures.  (T-2) 6.60.1.  The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border clearance of all aircraft.  (T-2) 6.60.2.  When  staff  support  is  not  available,  border  clearance  is  the  responsibility  of  the aircraft commander.  Duties may be assigned to ground personnel or to other designated crew members, but the PIC retains ultimate responsibility.  The PIC is responsible for ensuring the following:  (T-2) 6.60.2.1.  Crew  members  and  passengers  possess  current  passports  and  valid  visas  (if required).  (T-2) 6.60.2.2.  Crew members and passengers have current certificates of immunization (PHS 731, shot record).  (T-2) 6.60.2.3.  Cargo entry documents are in proper order.  (T-2) 6.60.2.4.  Departing or entering the United States through an airport (civilian or military) where border clearance can be obtained.  (T-2) 6.60.2.5.  Obtaining border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and baggage, if required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign area.  (T-2)  6.60.2.6.  Spraying the aircraft (Foreign Clearance Guide and this AFI).  (T-2)  6.60.3.  Procedures for US Entry:  (T-2) 6.60.3.1.  En route, the LM or designated crew member will distribute personal customs declarations to  all passengers and crew members.  The  LM or designated crew member will  also  brief  passengers  and  crew  members  on  customs  regulations,  and  prepare  and compile necessary border clearance forms for signature.  (T-2) 64 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 6.60.3.2.  En route, the AMSS should notify the C2 agency or airfield contact at the base of  intended  landing  of  any  change  in  ETA  to  ensure  that  border  clearance  is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.  (T-2) 6.60.3.3.  Obtain  a  permit  to  proceed  when  military  necessities  require  that  an  aircraft (which has landed in the United States for customs clearance) proceeds to another base in the US  to  obtain border clearance.  The permit  to  proceed delays customs inspection of cargo,  passengers,  and  crew  until  arrival  at  the  off-load  station  and  saves  intermediate off-loading  and  reloading  normally  required  for  customs  inspection.    The  permit  to proceed  is  valid  only  to  the  airport  of  next  landing  where  the  border  clearance  must  be completed  or  a  new  permit  to  proceed  is  issued  by  a  customs  official.    Do  not  make intermediate  stops  between  the  issue  point  of  the  permit  to  proceed  and  destination  of manifested cargo unless required by an emergency situation or directed by the controlling C2 agency.  (T-2) 6.60.3.4.  When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative normally  will  meet  the  aircraft  to  obtain  the  required  documents.    Do  not  deplane passengers  or  crew  members  unless  necessary  for  safety  or  the  preservation  of  life  and property.    Do  not  unload  until  approved  by  customs  and  agriculture  personnel  or  their designated representatives.  This procedure applies to the initial landing in the US and all landings  required  when  operating  on  a  permit  to  proceed  or  until  all  crew,  passengers, and cargo complete final border clearance.  (T-2) 6.61.  Customs, Immigration, and Agriculture Inspections: 6.61.1.  Obtain  Customs,  Agriculture,  and  Public  Health  clearance,  as  required,  prior  to opening any doors, hatches, or windows, other than the left forward entry door, for enplaning host nation personnel.  (T-2) 6.61.2.  Proceed  directly  from  the  aircraft  to  Customs,  Immigration,  or  Agricultural inspection for processing when required by the inspector.  (T-2) 6.61.3.  US  military  aircraft  are  sovereign.    When  cleared  to  overfly  or  land  in  foreign territory,  it  is  US  policy  to  assert  that  military  aircraft  are  entitled  to  the  privileges  and immunities  which  customarily  are  accorded  warships.    These  privileges  and  immunities include,  in  the  absence  of  stipulations  to  the  contrary,  exemption  from  duties  and  taxation; immunity  from  search,  seizure,  and  inspections  (including  customs,  immigration  and agriculture inspections); or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel, equipment, or cargo on board.  USAF PICs  should not authorize search, seizure, inspection,  or  similar  exercises  of  jurisdiction  enumerated  above  by  foreign  authorities except  by  direction  of  Headquarters  United  States  Air  Force  (USAF)  or  the  American Embassy in the country concerned.  (T-2) 6.61.4.  PICs  should  not  permit  the  inspection  of  their  aircraft  by  officials  of  any  foreign government (including customs, immigration and agriculture inspections).  If requested to do so, the PIC and crew should deny access and seek aid from the senior USAF representative, US  Embassy,  or  consulate  within  the  host  nation.    Customs  or  other  officials  will  be informed  of  the  above  policy  and  requested  to  confirm  their  request  through  their  own government and with US Department of State representatives.  If necessary, the crew should seal the aircraft and the crew entered into crew rest, departure intention should be canceled, AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 65 until  resolution  of  the  matter  by  appropriate  authority.    Inform  command  and  control authorities by the fastest available means should this situation occur.  Note:  PIC’s should be aware that denying entry to host nation customs/agriculture may result in the suspension of all  ground  services  at  the  airfield  (ATC  filing,  refueling,  meals  etc.)  and  the  ability  for  the aircrew  to  deplane  and  enter  crew  rest  (if  applicable).    PIC’s  will  use  their  judgment  to determine the best course of action, taking into consideration the urgency and priority of the mission  and  aircraft  security.    In  all  cases,  AmEmbassy  guidance  (if  available)  will  be followed.  (T-2) 6.61.5.  When  confronted  with  a  search  request  by  foreign  authorities,  aircrews  should consider the following procedures:  (T-2) 6.61.5.1.  In  most  cases,  search  attempts  may  be  stopped  by  a  statement  of  PICs  to  the foreign officials that the aircraft is sovereign and not subject to search without consent of HQ  USAF  or  the  chief  of  mission  in  the  country  concerned.    This  should  be  clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign authorities who may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft.  (T-2) 6.61.5.2.  If  foreign  authorities  insist  on  conducting  a  search,  PICs  should  negotiate  to delay  the  search  until  contact  is  made  with  the  appropriate  embassy.    PICs  should unequivocally state that they have no authority to consent to the search and that they must relay  the  foreign  request  to  these  agencies  for  decision.    PICs  should  then  notify  these agencies  of  the  foreign  request  by  the  most  expeditious  means  available.    Thereafter, PICs should follow instructions provided by the appropriate embassy and HQ USAF.  (T-2) 6.61.5.3.  If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, PICs should indicate that  they  would  prefer  to  fly  the  aircraft  elsewhere  (provided  fuel  and  mechanical considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission to do so.  (T-2) 6.61.5.4.  If permission  is  refused and the  foreign authorities insist  on forcing their way on board an aircraft, PICs should state that they protest the course of action being pursued and that they intend to notify both the appropriate American Embassy and HQ USAF of the  foreign  action.    PICs  should  then  allow  the  foreign  agents  on  board  the  aircraft, without  physical  resistance,  and  thereafter  report  the  incident  to  HQ  USAF  and appropriate embassy as soon as possible.  (T-2) 6.61.5.5.  In all instances, specific instructions may be briefed because of sensitive cargo or equipment.  These instructions and applicable provisions of classified supplements to the foreign clearance guide should be followed where applicable.  (T-2) 6.62.  Insect and Pest Control. 6.62.1.  Responsibility.    PICs  will  ensure  required  spraying  is  accomplished  according  to AFJI  48-104,  Quarantine  Regulations  of  the  Armed  Forces  (Joint),  Department  of  Defense Foreign Clearance Guide, or as directed by higher headquarters.  Certify the spraying on CBP 7507, or on forms provided by the country transited.  Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on-board.  The only exception is when the Foreign Clearance Guide mandates it.  (T-2) 66 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 6.62.2.  Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD).  On arrival at an APOD, do not open  cargo  doors  or  hatches  except  to  enplane  officials  required  to  inspect  the  aircraft  for insect or rodent infestation or to deplane the minimum number of crew members required for block-in  duties.    Do  not  on-load  or  off-load  cargo  or  passengers  until  the  inspection  is satisfactorily  completed.    This  procedure  may  be  altered  to  satisfy  mission  or  local requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.  (T-2) 6.63.  Operational  Prerogative  of  Military  Aircraft  (Due  Regard  Procedures).  When operationally  necessary,  PICs  are  authorized  to  conduct  military  flight  operations  with  due regard  for  the  safety  of  navigation  of  civil  traffic  in  international  airspace  IAW  FLIP  General Planning  (GP).  Except  for  pre-planned  missions,  PICs  shall  consider  such  operations  in peacetime as a flight rule deviation and will comply with the reporting requirements in AFI 11-202, Vol 3 Paragraph 1.6.  (T-0) MAJCOMs may  authorize tactical  operations for training and compliance with AFI 11-202, Vol 3 Paragraph 1.2.5.  (T-2) 6.64.  Hazardous  Material  Procedures.  The term "hazardous material" refers to any material, because  of  its  quantity,  properties,  or  packaging,  may  endanger  human  life  or  property.  Reference AFJI 11-204 and AFJM 24-204 for all procedures and restrictions when handling any hazardous materials.  Waiver authority is MAJCOM/CC.  (T-2) 6.65.  Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards (ETOPS): 6.65.1.  ETOPS are operations in  any  geographical  area where, at  any point on the planned route, the aircraft will be more than 60 minutes from an adequate airport, at the single engine drift  down  speed  and  altitude  in  still  air.    An  ETOPS  area  of  operation  may  also  be considered  to  apply  to  over-land  areas  having  suitable  airports  within  60  minutes,  at  the single  engine  drift  down  speed  and  altitude  in  still  air,  but  are  not  considered  useable  for political or military considerations. 6.65.2.  The C-32B is considered 180 minute ETOPS compliant. 6.65.3.  ETOPS  relief  and  waivers.    Unit  CC/DO  is  the  waiver  authority  for  all  ETOPS related waivers.  (T-3) 6.65.3.1.  ETOPS relief notification due to route.  If upon optimizing the flight plan, the flight cannot remain within the maximum ETOPS range, the mission planner or aircrew will notify the unit CC/DO.  For flights that cannot remain within the maximum ETOPS range the following applies.  (T-3) 6.65.3.1.1.  Training  missions:    ETOPS  compliance  is  mandatory.    Flights  will  be rerouted, delayed or cancelled until all ETOPS criteria are satisfied.  (T-3) 6.65.3.1.2.  HHQ  directed  alert  launches  or  operational  support  missions:    The  unit CC/DO  will  evaluate  and  direct  the  aircrew  how  they  want  the  mission  to  proceed.  (T-3) 6.65.3.2.  ETOPS  waivers  for  mechanical  reasons.    If  the  MEL  item  states  “Except  for ER”, “Extended range not authorized” or lists a lower ETOPS time value (120, 90, etc.), the following applies.  (T-3) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 67 6.65.3.2.1.  Training  missions  must  comply  with  the  MEL  directed  ETOPS  range limits.  If unable to comply, they will not operate in extended range airspace until the condition is corrected.  (T-3) 6.65.3.2.2.  HHQ  directed  alert  launches  or  operational  support  missions:    Waiver authority  for extended range operations outside the MEL is the unit CC/DO.   Note:  Other than extended range operations, OG/CC (or equivalent) retains all MEL waiver authority.  (T-3) 6.65.4.  Dispatch  Criteria.    Flights  shall  not  be  dispatched  on  an  ETOPS  flight  unless  the required suitable ETOPS en route alternates are reviewed prior to flight.  An airport may not be listed as a suitable ETOPS en route alternate unless:  (T-3) 6.65.4.1.  The landing distance required meets the criteria established in Table 5.1 of this AFI.  (T-3) 6.65.4.2.  The  airport  services  and  facilities  are  adequate  for  the  approved  approach procedure(s) and operating minima for the runway expected to be used.  (T-3) 6.65.4.3.  The  latest  available  forecast  weather  conditions  from  the  earliest  time  of landing  to  the  latest  time  of  landing  at  the  airport,  equals  or  exceeds  the  authorized planning weather minima for ETOPS en route alternate airports.  In addition, for the same time period, the forecast crosswind component (including gust) for the expected landing runway shall not exceed the maximum crosswind permitted in Table 5.3 of this AFI.  (T-3) 6.65.4.4.  The  airport  must  have  one  of  the  following  combinations  of  instrument approach capabilities and weather minima:  (T-3) 6.65.4.4.1.  A  single  operational  navigation  facility.    For  airports  with  at  least  one operational  navigational  facility  providing  a  straight-in  non-precision  approach procedure, or Category I precision approach, or when applicable, a circling maneuver from  an  instrument  approach  procedure:    add  400ft  to  the  MDA(H)  or  DA(H),  as applicable and add 1SM or 1600m to the landing visibility minimum.  (T-3) 6.65.4.4.2.  For  airports  with  at  least  two  operational  navigational  facilities,  each providing a straight-in approach procedure to different suitable runways:  add 200ft to the higher DA(H) or MDA(H) of the two approaches used and add 1/2sm or 800m to the higher authorized landing visibility minimum of the two approaches used.  (T-3) 6.65.4.4.3.  For  airports  with  one  useable  authorized  Category  II  ILS  IAP,  use  a ceiling  of  300ft  and  visibility  ¾  sm  (1200  m)  or  RVR  4000  (1200  m)  Note:  Conditional  forecast  elements  need  not  be  considered,  except  that  PROB40  or TEMPO  condition  below  lowest  applicable  operating  minima  must  be  taken  into account.  Note:  For operations outside the United States, because of variations in the international  metric  weather  forecasting  standards,  700m  may  be  used  in  lieu  of 800m.  (T-3) 6.65.4.4.4.  Lower  than  standard  en  route  alternate  weather  minima.    If  a  suitable ETOPS alternate cannot  be found meeting the  guidance of  Paragraph    6.65.4.4 the flight  crew  or  mission  planner  will  select  a  suitable  alternate  having  a  ceiling  and visibility  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  lowest  suitable  approach  minimums  available 68 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 (excluding  radar)  for  the  expected  runway  in  use,  but  not  less  than  a  ceiling  of  200 feet  and  a  visibility  of  one-half  statute  mile  (800m)  or  RVR  2,400;  whichever  is higher;  and  winds  within  operational  limits  of  the  aircraft,  corrected  for  RCR.    If these minima are used, the aircrew must be notified prior to departure.  The mission planner and the aircraft commander will evaluate the weather and diversion scenario and shall formulate an understanding of the preferred diversion  airports that may be used  during  the  portion  of  the  flight  affected  by  the  use  of  the  en-route  alternate weather  minima.    Note:    Lower  than  standard  en  route  weather  minima  is  for operational  or  operations  support  missions  with  passengers  only.    Unit  CC/DO approval is required.  For training missions, comply with 6.65.3.1.1.  (T-3) 6.65.5.  ETOPS Range Calculations:  An initial calculation is performed to determine ETOPS range  and  location  of  ETP(s)  for  a  diversion  based  on  the  scenario  whereby  an  engine  loss occurs  at  the  most  critical  point,  and  the  aircraft  continues  to  the  alternate  at  an  approved power setting, at the engine inoperative drift down altitude.  This calculation is based on an average  no  wind  true  airspeed  constant  not  exceeding  the  AFM  limitations  for  speed  and altitude.  Computation of the ETOPS range limitation is determined by the following:  (T-3) 6.65.5.1.  Engine loss and decompression is at the most critical point (ETP).  (T-3) 6.65.5.2.  Immediate descent to, and continued cruise at 10,000 feet at the approved one-engine inoperative cruise speed, in still air.  (T-3) 6.65.5.3.  Using  the  FPPM,  assuming  an  in-flight  weight  of  210,000  and  a  speed  of 310/.80 the range for 180 minutes is 1,268 nm.  (T-3) 6.65.6.  ETOPS Fuel Requirements.  Additional fuel requirements for all flights operating in extended  range  airspace,  as  defined  by  Paragraph  6.65.1,  will  account  for  the  following:  (T-3) 6.65.6.1.  Upon  reaching  the  suitable  alternate,  descent  to  1,500  feet  above  the  field elevation, hold for 15 minutes, and then execution of a normal approach and landing.  (T-3) 6.65.6.1.1.  5% penalty for errors in wind forecasts.  (T-3) 6.65.6.1.2.  5% penalty in fuel mileage for engine deterioration.  (T-3) 6.65.6.1.3.  APU operation.  (T-3) 6.65.6.1.4.  MEL/CDL penalties.  (T-3) 6.65.6.1.5.  Airframe  and  engine  Anti-icing.    Note:    Only  required  if  temperatures below  a  certain  value  are  expected  during  the  diversion.    Note:    These  fuel requirements  are  calculated  from  the  extended  range  entry  to  exit  point,  not  for  the entire route of flight.  (T-3) 6.65.7.  En-Route Progress. 6.65.7.1.  Prior  to  the  extended  range  entry  point.    During  the  course  of  the  flight,  the aircrew will stay informed of any significant changes in conditions at the designated en route  alternates.    Prior  to  the  extended  range  entry  point,  the  aircrew  will  ensure  the weather from the earliest to the latest time of landing at the designated ETOPS alternates, equals or exceeds the authorized planning weather minima for en route alternate airports.  AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 69 In addition, for the same time period, the forecast crosswind component for the expected landing runway shall not exceed the maximum crosswind component permitted in Table 5.3  of  this  AFI.    Additionally,  landing  distances  and  airport  services  at  the  en-route alternate must be evaluated.  If any conditions are identified which would preclude a safe approach and landing, and no other suitable alternates are available with 180 minutes, the aircraft commander will notify the unit CC/DO to determine the best course of action.  If contact  is  not  practical,  the  aircraft  commander  will  make  the  decision  on  how  to continue  the  mission.    Note:    Training  missions  must  comply  with  all  ETOPS requirements prior to the extended range entry point.  (T-3) 6.65.7.2.  After  the  extended  range  entry  point.    If  an  en  route  alternate  becomes unsuitable  after  the  aircraft  has  passed  the  extended  range  entry  point,  ETOPS  weather minimums  no  longer  apply.    Conditions  need  only  permit  a  safe  approach  and  landing.  The decision on how to continue rests with the PIC and needs no further approval.  This is applicable to all missions (including aircrew training missions).  (T-3) 6.65.8.  Malfunctions/Emergencies. 6.65.8.1.  General.    In the event  of  a single or multiple critical  system failure with  only one  associated  system  remaining,  the  crew  shall  fly  and  land  at  the  nearest  suitable airport.  Base this decision on all relevant factors such as aircraft conditions, weather en route  and  suitability  of  alternate  airports,  and  notify  command  and  control  as  soon  as practical of this decision.  (T-3) 6.65.8.2.  Situations which require a landing at the nearest suitable airport include but are not limited to:  (T-3) 6.65.8.2.1.  Engine failure/fire.  (T-3) 6.65.8.2.2.  Cabin smoke/fire which cannot be positively verified or extinguished.  (T-3) 6.65.8.2.3.  Cargo compartment fire.  (T-3) 6.65.8.2.4.  Operations with only one hydraulic system or with only one engine driven generator (without an APU) remaining.  (T-3) 6.65.8.2.5.  Dual EICAS failure.  Note:  If an aircraft is unable to continue its flight in accordance with its ATC clearance, a revised clearance shall, whenever possible, be obtained prior to initiating any action using the radio distress or urgency message, as appropriate.  Note:  If prior clearance cannot be obtained, an ATC clearance shall be obtained at the earliest possible time.  In the meantime, the crew shall broadcast the aircrafts position (including the track/airway as appropriate) and intentions on 121.5 MHz at suitable intervals until ATC clearance is received.  (T-3) 6.65.8.3.  Before Passing The Extended Range Entry Point:  (T-3) 6.65.8.3.1.  On 120 minute ETOPS, the flight may not proceed beyond the extended range entry point if any of the following failures or malfunctions have occurred:  (T-3) 6.65.8.3.1.1.  Fuel Filter Message.  (T-3) 6.65.8.3.1.2.  Air conditioning pack.  (T-3) 70 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 6.65.8.3.1.3.  Cargo  compartment  fire  extinguisher  system,  unless  both  cargo compartments are empty or only non-combustible materials are carried.  (T-3) 6.65.8.3.1.4.  Loss of left hydraulic system together with a generator failure.  (T-3) 6.65.8.3.1.5.  Engine and/or wing anti-ice unless the aircraft is not to be operated in known or forecast icing conditions.  (T-3) 6.65.8.3.1.6.  Dual IRS failure.  (T-3)  6.65.8.3.1.7.  Dual EFIS failure (one symbol generator remaining).  (T-3) 6.65.8.3.1.8.  Single FMS system failure.  Note:  Both FMS systems required for entry into oceanic airspace.  (T-3) 6.65.8.3.2.  In  addition  to  the  above  items  a  flight  may  not  proceed  beyond  the extended range entry point on 180 minute ETOPS flights if the following failures or malfunctions have occurred:  (T-3) 6.65.8.3.2.1.  Loss of left hydraulic system.  (T-3) 6.65.8.3.2.2.  Loss of a generator.  (T-3) 6.65.8.3.2.3.  Left or center IRS failure.  (T-3) 6.65.8.3.2.4.  Single EFIS failure (symbol generator).  (T-3) 6.65.8.3.2.5.  Weather radar.  (T-3) 6.66.  Inappropriate  Charges.  IAW  the  DoD  Foreign  Clearance  Guide,  Foreword  Section  II, aircrews should not pay inappropriate charges, which include any air navigation, overflight fees, and landing or parking at any government airport.  If asked to pay such charges aircrews should:  (T-2) 6.66.1.  Advise the local authorities that the charges are inappropriate for a US Government aircraft and the aircrew cannot pay them.  (T-2) 6.66.2.  Contact  USDAO  personnel  or  other  appropriate  AmEmbassy  officials  either  at  the airport  or  at  the  embassy  itself  and  follow  their guidance.    Note:    USDAO  or  AmEmbassy intervention may not always be feasible.  (T-2) 6.66.3.  If  there  is  no  USDAO  or  AmEmbassy  guidance  to  the  contrary  and  the  local authorities will not let the aircraft depart without payment, aircrews should do the following:  (T-2) 6.66.3.1.  Obtain a fully itemized copy of the receipt or bill bearing the printed name and legible  signature  of  the  person  accepting  payment  and  note  the  amount  paid.    Note:  Verify the signer’s identity by asking to see photo identification (if available).  (T-2) 6.66.3.2.  If cash payment is demanded, insist that the bill include a statement written in English that cash was paid and that a specific person received it.  (T-2) 6.66.3.3.  Mark inappropriate charges on the receipt or bill:  “INVALID FEES.” (T-2) 6.66.3.4.  Annotate the receipt or bill with the remark:  “PAID UNDER PROTEST.” (T-2) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 71 6.66.3.5.  Submit  the  signed  receipt  or  bill  to  the  finance  officer  at  the  aircrew’s  home station.  (T-2) 72 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 Chapter 7 AIRCRAFT SECURITY 7.1.  General.  This  chapter provides  guidance on aircraft security and preventing  and resisting unlawful  seizure  (hijacking)  of  aircraft.    AFI  13-207,  Preventing  and  Resisting  Aircraft  Piracy (Hijacking);  AFI  31-101,  Integrated  Defense  and  specific  MAJCOM  security  publications contain  additional  guidance.    Aircrews  will  not  release  information  concerning  hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members to the public.  (T-1) 7.2.  Security.  The  C-32B  is  normally  designated  as  a  protection  level  “3”  asset.    However,  it requires protection level “2” if Top Secret/SCI information is to be stored on board.  AFI 31-101 determines  the  security  requirements  for  assets  that  are  to  be  left  unattended  on  U.S.    Military bases.  The PIC is responsible for aircraft security at non-military installations.  HHQ or the unit OG/CC  (or  equivalent)  may  direct  the  use  of  security  measures  above  and  beyond  the requirements set forth by the PIC.  (T-3) 7.3.  Air Force Physical Security Program.  The following security procedures will implement AFI 31-101, and AFI 13-207, requirements for C-32B aircraft:  (T-2) 7.3.1.  PIC  Authority.    The  PIC  will  ensure  that  adequate  aircraft  security  measures  are provided at all times.  (T-1)  If, in the PIC’s opinion, airfield security is inadequate and the safety of the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the flight duty period limits and crew rest  requirements  and  depart  as  soon  as  possible  for  an  airfield  considered  reliable;  report movement  and intentions to  the controlling agency as soon as practical.   If departure is  not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of their ability.  In no case, will the crew  leave  the  aircraft  unattended.    Crew  rest  requirements  will  be  subordinate  to  aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.  The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew  to  provide  for  both  aircraft  protection  and  crew  rest  until  relief  is  available.    Request security  assistance  from  the  nearest  DoD  installation,  US  Embassy,  local  military  or  law enforcement agencies as appropriate.  (T-2) 7.3.2.  Advance  Security  Support  Arrangements.    Unit  mission  planners  and  the  PIC  will ensure  security  support  has  been  coordinated  at  en  route  stations  in  advance.    If  security requirements  cannot  be  met  prior  to  departure,  the  airfield  may  be  deemed  unsuitable  for RON by the unit.  Units should use local, MAJCOM and AOR Intel/Threat Working Group (TWG)  and  US  Embassy  recommendations  to  determine  suitability.    The  OG/CC  (or equivalent) is the arbiter for security.  CC/DO and unit mission planners will work with the PIC for alert missions and en route diversions.  (T-3) 7.3.3.  Briefings.    PICs  will  obtain  threat  assessment  and  security  capability  evaluation briefings before departing home station for all missions that will RON outside of the United States or its territories.  Unit CC/DO will ensure the PIC is provided with pertinent updates en route.  (T-3) 7.3.4.  Baggage Security.  Baggage not certified safe for loading by a responsible government agency  will  be  inspected  prior  to  loading  at  the  PIC's  discretion.    Verify  baggage identification against the passenger manifest (if possible).  Aircrew members will secure their own  baggage.    The  PIC  or  designated  representative  is  responsible  for  explaining  baggage security requirements to the passenger POC.  (T-2) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 73 7.3.5.  Flight line Photography.  There are no restrictions on exterior photography of the C-32B.    Interior  photography  is  allowed  at  home  station.    Interior  photos  of  en  route  C-32B aircraft are prohibited.  (T-2) 7.4.  Detecting Unauthorized Entry. 7.4.1.  Anytime  the  aircraft  is  to  remain  overnight  (RON)  or  will  be  left  unattended  for  a significant amount of time, the following procedures apply:  (T-3) 7.4.1.1.  Lock  all  interior  hatches  from  the  inside  and  a  padlock  will  be  placed  on  the crew entry door and the forward E&E compartment.  (T-3) 7.4.1.2.  The  two  padlock  locations  will  be  sealed  with  alphanumeric  seals.    The  seal numbers will be recorded by a crew member or unit maintenance.  (T-3) 7.4.1.3.  Upon return to  the aircraft or at the  completion of crew rest,  whichever occurs first,  a  crew  member  or  unit  maintenance  will  verify  the  seal  numbers  and  the  internal security of the other aircraft entry points.  (T-3) 7.4.1.4.  Preflight  inspections  will  be  expanded  to  include  a  thorough  check  of  all accessible  areas,  to  include  aircraft  wheel  wells,  keel  beam  bays  and  lower  nose compartment for unauthorized packages, personnel, other unfamiliar devices or any signs of tampering.  Report any suspicious items to host security forces.  (T-3) 7.4.2.  Suspected Unauthorized Entry.  If the PIC suspects aircraft has been tampered with or subjected to unauthorized entry, take the following actions:  (T-3) 7.4.2.1.  Notify  the  local  security  authorities  and  request  a  thorough  inspection  of  the aircraft for sabotage, explosive devices, and pilferage.  (T-3) 7.4.2.2.  Notify  the  appropriate  C2  agency.    Advise  them  of  any  requirements  for assistance, and give them your estimate of a revised departure time.  (T-3) 7.4.2.3.  If  there  are  indications  that  sabotage  is  a  possibility  or  if  security  inspections may  delay  the  departure  notify  C2  and  the  passenger  POC.    Establish  a  new  departure time.  If necessary, coordinate alternate transportation for the passengers through C2.  (T-3) 7.4.2.4.  Monitor the security check of the aircraft.  When cleared by security authorities, conduct  thorough  preflight  inspection.    Look  for  broken  wiring,  damaged  components, foreign devices, etc.  (T-3) 7.4.2.5.  If  both  the  security  authorities  and  the  PIC  are  assured  aircraft  is  safe  to  fly, notify the OG/CC (or equivalent).  Depart only with the OG/CC approval.  (T-3) 7.4.3.  Security  awareness  is  crucial  to  effective  mission  accomplishment.    Aircrews  must always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.  Aircrews should maintain a heightened security posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities. 7.5.  Protecting  Classified  Material  on  Aircraft.  The PIC is responsible for the protection of classified materials aboard their aircraft.  The AMSS is responsible for supporting the PIC with these  duties.    Comply  with  AFI  33-201,  Vol  1,  Communications  Security,  AFI  33-201,  Vol  2, Communications  Security  User  Requirements,  and  this  AFI  for  the  storage  and  protection  of classified material.  (T-2) 74 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 7.6.  Preventing and Resisting Hijacking. 7.6.1.  General.    See  AFI  13-207,  Preventing  and  Resisting  Aircraft  Piracy  (Hijacking)  for guidance.  (T-2) 7.7.  Arming  of  Crew  Members.  When  crews  are  directed  to  arm,  the  PIC  will  determine which  crew  members  will  be  armed  (two  crew  members  will  be  armed  unless  directed otherwise).    (T-1)    All  crew  members  should  know  who  is  armed.    Aircrew  will  check  out weapons  when  directed  by  C2  or  IAW  the  OPORD  or  OPLAN.    Aircrews  will  arm  IAW Chapter  10  of  this  AFI.    Unit  commanders  will  ensure  that  crew  members  are  familiar  with weapon  issue,  loading,  transfer,  and  receipt  procedures.    Comply  with  AFMAN  31-229,  USAF Weapons Handling Manual, AFI 13-207 and Chapter 10 of this AFI for all arming requirements and procedures.  If an armed crew member must leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew member using AF 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.  (T-3) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 75 Chapter 8 AIR-TO-AIR REFUELING PROCEDURES 8.1.  General.  For  AAR  procedures,  "receiver"  refers  to  the  C-32B.    "Tanker”  refers  to  the KC10/135.  NATO publication ATP-56(B), Air-To-Air Refueling provides guidance for refueling terminology and procedures. 8.2.  Air-to-Air Refueling Limitations.  This chapter establishes guidelines applicable to C-32B aircraft  and  aircrews,  and  is  supplemental  to  those  prescribed  by  the  flight  manual  and  other applicable directives.  (T-2) 8.2.1.  Refueling  During  Training  Missions.    AAR  should  not  be  accomplished  during training missions when:  (T-2) 8.2.1.1.  Conditions  are  encountered  that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  PIC,  result  in  marginal control of either aircraft or the boom.  (T-2) 8.2.1.2.  Either  the  tanker  or  the  receiver  has  less  than  the  full  number  of  engines operating.  (T-2) 8.2.1.3.  Tanker Autopilot.  Tanker pilots must notify receiver pilots when any axis of the autopilot is not used.  (T-2) 8.2.1.4.  Manual Boom Latching.  Without tanker disconnect capability means the boom operator cannot trigger an immediate disconnect.  AAR operations will not be conducted after a known loss of tanker disconnect capability.  Exception:  Fuel emergency situation or contingency operations.  Exception:  Manual boom latching procedures are authorized for  all  refueling  operations  with  the  KC-10A  if  the  tanker's  independent  disconnect system  (IDS)  is  operational.    Note:    When  conducting  AAR  without  tanker  automatic disconnect  capability,  limit  contacts  to  the  minimum  number  necessary  to  complete mission  requirements.    Do  not  accomplish  boom  limit  demonstrations,  or  practice emergency separation while in the contact position.   Note:  Boom operator and receiver pilot must coordinate all actions as required by applicable directives and checklists when making AAR contacts using emergency boom latching procedures.  (T-1) 8.2.2.  Practice Emergency Separation: 8.2.2.1.  Prior  to  the  actual  accomplishment  of  a  practice  emergency  separation, coordination  between  the  tanker  pilot,  boom  operator,  and  receiver  pilot  is  mandatory.  Coordination  must  include  when  the  separation  will  occur  and  who  will  give  the command of execution.  Tanker pilot coordination may be accomplished over interphone with the boom operator.  (T-2) 8.2.2.2.  If  separation  is  initiated  from  the  contact  position,  the  receiver’s  AAR  system must be in normal, and boom operator disconnect capability with the receiver must exist.  (T-2) 8.2.2.3.  Practice  emergency  separation  will  not  be  accomplished  with  passengers  on board.  Exception:  When the only passengers on the aircraft are Supporting Forces and 108  WG  aircrew  members,  ie.    KC-135  pilots  and  boom  operators,  practice  emergency separations are authorized for demonstration/familiarization purposes.  (T-2) 76 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 8.2.3.  Receiver  AAR  Training  for  Unqualified  or  Non-Current  Receiver  Pilots.    In-Flight training  will  be  accomplished  under  direct  AAR/IP  supervision  (access  to  a  set  of  flight controls) and the following procedures apply:  (T-2) receiver  pilot re-qualification,  a receiver 8.2.3.1.  For instructor/examiner  pilot  will  be  in  one  of  the  pilot  seats  with  immediate  access  to  the controls through all phases of the refueling from pre-contact until post AAR.  (T-2) initial  qualification  or 8.2.3.2.  Pilots  that  are  not  PF  AAR  qualified,  may  fly  AAR  maneuvers  including contacts with an AAR IP in one of the pilot seats with immediate access to the controls thorough all phases of the refueling from pre-contact to post-AAR on designated training sorties  with  no  passengers  onboard  (unit  maintenance  personnel,  MEP  and/or  certain supporting forces are not considered passengers for these purposes).  (T-2) 8.2.3.3.  If  a  change  of  pilot  control  is  made,  the  receiver  aircraft  will  move  back  to  at least the pre-contact position except for immediate assumption of control by the IP.  (T-2) 8.2.3.4.  If a receiver seat change takes place, move back to at least 100 feet in trail of the tanker and to a point where the receiver pilot can maintain visual contact with the tanker until the seat change is completed.  (T-2) 8.2.3.5.  When conducting AAR behind a KC-135 tanker, disconnect capability must be demonstrated  by  a  boom  operator  initiated  disconnect  prior  to  conducting  a  limit demonstration or a practice emergency separation from the contact position.  (T-2) 8.2.4.  Weather Limitations. 8.2.4.1.  Turbulence:    Do  not  plan  to  refuel  in  areas  of  forecast  or  actual  severe turbulence.  Terminate refueling if moderate turbulence is encountered.  (T-2) 8.2.4.2.  Visibility:  Do not plan to refuel in areas where forecast visibility is less than 1 nm.    Do  not  close  from  1  nm  range  (2  nm  for  tanker  cell  formations)  unless  you  have visual contact with the tankers.  Discontinue refueling if in-flight visibility is insufficient to continue safe refueling operations.  (T-2) 8.3.  Receiver PIC Responsibilities. 8.3.1.  Receiver aircraft shall squawk normal when separation from the tanker is greater than 3 miles or as requested by ATC.  (T-2) 8.3.2.  Receiver  aircraft  will  maintain  two-way  radio  contact  with  ATC  until  cleared  to  the AAR  block  altitude,  established  in  that  block,  and  cleared  to  the  AAR  frequency  by  ATC.  (T-2) 8.4.  ATC Clearance. 8.4.1.  Altitude  Reservations  (ALTRV).    Air-to-air  refueling  operations  are  normally accomplished on tracks or in anchor areas published in the DoD Flight Planning Document (FLIP).  Certain missions or operational considerations may require AAR operations in areas not  published  in  FLIP  in  which  an  ALTRV  is  often  used.    Note:    The  following  ALTRV guidance is FAA approved and these procedures should be followed while in FAA controlled airspace.    When  operating  in  oceanic  or  foreign  airspace,  the  guidance  may  or  may  not  be applicable.  Aircrews should verify all ALTRV procedures and restrictions with the mission planner, host nation air traffic service or OPORD as applicable.  (T-2) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 77 8.4.1.1.  An  ALTRV  may  include  all,  a  portion,  or  portions  of  a  published  route.    On operational  missions,  an  ALTRV  is  usually  provided  for  the  refueling  portions  of  the route.  In some cases, an ALTRV is provided from the point of departure to a specified point short of the destination.  (T-2) 8.4.1.2.  Aircraft  operating  on  an  ALTRV  must  operate  within  the  altitude,  time,  and areas  specified.    Actual  fix  timing  will  not  exceed  10  minutes  from  ALTRV  estimates; otherwise the ALTRV will be canceled by ATC.  (T-2) 8.4.1.3.  The  mission  must  be  airborne  within  a  certain  time  period.    The  end  of  this period  is  the  “ALTRV  Void  if  Aircraft  Not  Airborne”  time  (AVANA).    This  ensures separation between aircraft.  Unless otherwise specified, AVANA is 1 hour after ALTRV published departure time. 8.4.1.4.  If  a  mission  is  delayed  beyond  AVANA,  rescheduling  normally  is  by  24  hour increments  based  on  the  original  departure  time.    It  may  be  less  provided  the  Central Altitude  Reservation  Function  (CARF)  and  affected  air  traffic  control  agencies  concur.  (T-2) 8.4.1.5.  An  ALTRV  does  not  preclude  ATC  from  using  ALTRV  airspace  provided standard separation is applied between all aircraft.  (T-2) 8.4.1.6.  ALTRV Format.  See FAA 7610.4, Special Military Operations.  (T-2) 8.4.2.  Refer to ATP-56(B), Part 1 for ALTRV filing and employment information.  (T-2) 8.5.  Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft (MARSA). 8.5.1.  Acceptance of MARSA normally is the tanker's responsibility.  MARSA begins when requested  by  the  tanker  and  approved  by  the  controlling  air  traffic  service.    This  is  usually done prior to  the air-to-air refueling initial  point (ARIP) or rendezvous initial point (RVIP) for  AAR  conducted  on  published  tracks.    When  a  rendezvous  is  conducted  in  an  area  that does  not  use  a  normal  AAR  track  or  anchor  rendezvous  (RV  Alpha)  procedures,  MARSA begins when participating aircraft enter the refueling airspace.  (T-2) 8.5.2.  MARSA  ends  when  normal  separation  standards  are  established  and  ATC  accepts control at the end of refueling.  (T-2) 8.6.  Planning  Factors.  Mission  planners  will  provide  the  aircrews  with  coordinates  for  the AAR entry point (AREP), ARIP/RVIP, AAR control point (ARCP), and AAR exit point (AAR EXIT PT).  (T-2) 8.6.1.  Primary  control time for a point parallel rendezvous (RV Delta) will  be the time the receiver arrives at the ARCP.  This is designated as the AAR control time (ARCT).  Primary control time for an en route rendezvous (RV Golf) will be the time the receiver arrives at the RVIP.  This is designated  as the rendezvous control time (RVCT).  For both RV Delta and RV Golf, the ARCT is used as the emergency or missed rendezvous reference time.  (T-2) 8.6.2.  Both  tanker  and  receiver  crews  must  be  thoroughly  familiar  with  all  aspects  of refueling  in  order  to  adequately  plan  the  mission.    Crew  members  will  receive  a  weather forecast  for  the  AAR  area  so  that  alternate  plans  can  be  utilized  when  the  primary  track  is unsuitable.  AAR tracks should be planned to coincide with receiver’s route of flight, when 78 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 possible.    Also,  both  tanker  and  receiver  crews  must  be  thoroughly  familiar  with  the following in order to adequately plan the mission:  (T-2) 8.6.2.1.  AAR ARIP.  (T-2) 8.6.2.2.  AAR Track.  (T-2) 8.6.2.3.  AAR ARCP.  (T-2) 8.6.2.4.  AAR ARCT.  (T-2) 8.6.2.5.  AAR Altitudes.  (T-2) 8.6.2.6.  AAR Abort Point.  (T-2) 8.6.2.7.  AAR EXIT PT.  (T-2) 8.6.2.8.  Recovery and Emergency Bases.  (T-2) 8.6.2.9.  Tanker and Receiver Call Signs.  (T-2) 8.6.2.10.  Standby Tanker Requirements.  (T-2) 8.6.2.11.  Formation and Individual Tactics.  (T-2) 8.6.2.12.  Rendezvous/AAR Frequencies and Beacon Settings.  (T-2) 8.6.2.13.  Fuel Onload Requirements.  (T-2) 8.6.2.14.  Air Traffic Control Clearance Limits.  (T-2) 8.6.3.  Normally  conduct  air-to-air  refueling  on  an  IFR  clearance.    Refueling  may  be conducted  under  VFR  when  coordinated  with  the  controlling  ARTCC.    Air-to-air  refueling under Due Regard should only be done as a last resort when operational requirements dictate.  These procedures are permitted only with tanker concurrence.  (T-2) 8.6.4.  Fuel  transfer  rate  is  approximately  6,000  pounds  per  minute  for  the  KC-135  and approximately  8,000  pounds  per  minute  for  the  KC-10  with  all  tanker  air  refueling  pumps operating. 8.7.  Communications: 8.7.1.  During all AAR, the PIC will designate one crew member as the primary monitor for ATC.    This  crew  member  will  be  responsible  for  writing  down  any  clearance  issued  to  the tanker  for  the  receiver  aircraft.    The  PIC  will  ensure  the  receiver  and  the  tanker  are  on  the same frequency.  The PIC will ensure the accuracy of the clearance.  Reference ATP-56(B) for additional communication/EMCON information.  (T-2) 8.8.  Oral  Communications.  With  the  exception  of  the  breakaway  calls,  crew  members  may shorten individual call signs using only the number.  Example:  TERRA 11 (one-one) would be 11 (one-one).  (T-2) 8.8.1.  The communications requirements should be established prior to the flight.  Normally boom  visual  signals  will  be  used  exclusively;  however;  if  required  or  requested  by  the receiver,  the  boom  operator  will  begin  communications  when  the  receiver  reaches approximately  fifty  feet  from  the  contact  position.    Direction,  if  required,  will  precede distance  for  receiver  to  move  and  will  be  given  until  receiver  reaches  the  contact  position.  Example:  “Forward 50”, “Up 4”, “Back 2”.  (T-2) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 79 8.8.2.  For Emission Option 1 and 2, the boom operator will make a precontact radio check with the receiver and the receiver will acknowledge.  Example:  Tanker will say 62/15 (six-two, one-five), receiver will reply 15 (one-five).  (T-2) 8.8.3.  Refer to ATP-56(B) Part 1 for a full description of communication procedures.  (T-2) 8.8.4.  Emission  Option  3.    The  following  procedures  apply  specifically  when  operating under Emission Option 3.  (T-2) 8.8.4.1.  Mission  Planning.    The  elimination  of  the  15-minute  prior  call  increases  the element of risk, and the following guidelines should enhance safety considerations.  (T-2)  8.8.4.2.  Normally accomplish when clear of clouds.  (T-2)  8.8.4.3.  If  unable  to  remain  clear  of  clouds,  tanker(s)  and  receiver  will  immediately confirm altitudes.  (T-2) 8.8.4.4.  The receiver and tanker inbound courses to the RV/ARIP must be separated by a minimum of 30 degrees.  (T-2) 8.8.4.5.  The receiver and tanker inbound legs to the RV/ARIP must be a minimum of 40 nm in length.  (T-2) 8.8.4.6.  The  type  rendezvous  should  be  an  en  route  rendezvous  at  the  RVIP  with  both aircraft  using  the  same  RV  time.    The  receiver  should  rendezvous  1,000  feet  below  the tanker.    An  estimated  time  in  route  (ETE)  from  the  RV/ARIP  to  the  ARCP  should  be planned which permits an airspeed that falls in the middle of aircraft speed performance envelope.    It  is  essential  that  crews/planners  coordinate  certain  items  during  mission planning/development.  Minimum items include:  (T-2) 8.8.4.6.1.  Rendezvous altitudes.  (T-2) 8.8.4.6.2.  RV time and ARCT.  (T-2) 8.8.4.6.3.  Inbound courses to the RV/ARIP.  (T-2) 8.8.4.6.4.  Radio silent termination time in the event of a missed rendezvous.  (T-2) 8.8.4.7.  Once  departing  the  RVIP,  the  tanker  should  fly  centerline.    The  receiver  is  the maneuvering  aircraft.    If  the  tanker  is  behind  the  receiver,  the  tanker  should  accelerate and pass slightly off the left wing of the receiver.  Once the tanker boom operator has a good  visual  and  there  is  no  doubt  that  the  receiver  has  a  good  visual,  the  tanker  will establish AAR speed.   8.8.4.8.  Missed  Rendezvous  Procedures.    If  contact  is  not  established  at  the  RV/ARIP the  tanker  or  receiver  should  arrive  at  the  ARCP  at  the  ARCT.    This  procedure  begins when either aircraft arrives at the ARCP and does not have visual contact with the other.  In this case a left-hand orbit should be entered and orbit controlled so as to be over the ARCP at intervals of every eight minutes (ARCT plus eight, plus sixteen, etc).  While in the orbit, every attempt should be made to establish visual contact with the other aircraft.  The  length  of  delay  and  decision  as  to  how  long  to  continue  radio  silence  should  be determined during mission planning/development prior to flight.  (T-2) 8.9.  Visual  Signals.  Radio silent refueling can be conducted by use of visual signals provided precaution  and  procedures  are  observed.    Refer  to  ATP-56(B)  for  a  full  description  of  visual 80 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 signals.    Descriptions  and  diagrams  of  tanker  lighting  pilot  director  lights  (PDL)  for  the  KC-135/KC-10 can be found in ATP-56(B) Annex ZA and ZB, respectively.  (T-2) 8.10.  Lighting: 8.10.1.  While  accomplishing  a  rendezvous  and  descent  during  hours  of  darkness  or  during periods of limited visibility, the receiver will have the following exterior lights set to aid in visual acquisition.  The receiver’s position and anti-collision lights will be ON.  Applicable tanker external lights will be turned on at least 15 minutes prior to the latest known receiver ETA for the rendezvous point.  As the receiver approaches the precontact position, the flight deck  lights  will  be  dimmed  as  required,  and  the  upper  beacon  light  turned  OFF.    While approaching the contact  position, the intensity of receiver slipway lights  can be  adjusted as requested by the boom operator.  Diagrams of tanker lighting and pilot director lights (PDL) for the KC-135/KC-10 can be found in ATP-56(B) Annex ZA and ZB, respectively.   Note:  Visual  contact  for  night  AAR  (NAAR)  can  be  aided  by  requesting  the  tanker  flash  his landing light prior to and/or during the tanker turn.  (T-2) 8.10.2.  Single  tankers  performing  a  rendezvous  will  always  display  red/white  in  the  upper and lower rendezvous beacon lights.  The spare tanker will not display a rendezvous beacon light  during  the  rendezvous.    However,  if  the  spare  tanker  is  used  during  AAR,  the appropriate color code will be displayed until the receiver is in the precontact position.  To further  aid  in  identification,  tanker  position  lights  will  be  BRIGHT  and  FLASHING  for numbers  1  and  3  and  will  be  BRIGHT  and  STEADY  for  2  and  4.    After  the  receiver  has established visual contact and has closed to 1/2 nm in trail, tankers will turn position lights to STEADY  and  DIM  and  turn  lower  rotating  beacon  lights  OFF.    When  any  aircraft  will  be flying  visual  wing  formation  on  the  tanker,  the  tanker  will  also  turn  off  the  upper  rotating beacon.  See Figure 8.1.  (T-2) Table 8.1.  Tanker Identification Lighting. Tanker Number Light Color 1 2 3 4 Upper Red White Red-White White Lower Red White Red-White Red 8.10.3.  Pilot  Director  Lights.    The  director  lights  do  not  give  true  vertical  and  horizontal information.  The up-and-down lights change because of angular movement of the boom and the fore-and-aft lights change because of in-and-out movements of the boom.  The axis of the director light system is inclined at a 30-degree angle to the tanker fuselage.  The angle causes an indication in both lights when the receiver makes a true vertical or horizontal movement.  For  example,  flying  forward  while  in  contact  will  cause  the  boom  to  compress  and  also increase  its  angle  with  the  tanker  fuselage.    The  lights  will  show  that  the  aircraft  is  flying forward and down.  If a true up movement is made, the boom will compress and also lessen its  angle  with  the  tanker  fuselage  giving  a  combined  up  and  forward  indication  from  the lights.    When  this  interaction  between  lights  is  understood,  it  can  be  used  to  advantage  in keeping position.  Small fore-and-aft corrections can be made with little or no power change by  moving  vertically.    The  pilot  director  lights  will  remain  illuminated  and  follow  boom AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 81 movements in both the contact made and disconnect conditions.  Pilot director lights are on the  bottom  of  the  left  row  for  elevation  and  the  right  row  for  telescoping.    The  triangular shaped panels  are for  elevation and the rectangular shaped panels  are for forward  and back movement.  The elevation lights consist of five colored panels with a green stripe, green and red colors, and two illuminated letters:  D and U for Down and Up respectively. 8.10.4.  Background lights are located behind the panels.  The colored panels are illuminated by lights controlled by boom elevation during contact.  On the telescoping side, background lights do not illuminate the colored panels.  There is an illuminated white panel between each panel to serve as a reference.  The A for aft and F for forward augment the colored panels on the  telescoping  side.    The  receiver  pilot  director  lights  will  remain  illuminated  and  follow boom movements in both contact and disconnect conditions.  There are no lights for azimuth position.    The  pilot  may  use  a  fluorescent  yellow  stripe  on  the  bottom  center  of  the  tanker fuselage as a centerline reference. 8.11.  Boom  Envelope  Limits.  The  AAR  boom  envelope  is  the  operational  limits  dictated  by the aerodynamic control authority of the boom.  As long as the receiver is positioned inside the limits, contact can be held despite rolling, yawing, or pitching.  The envelope limits are set well within  mechanical  limits  of  the  boom  so  that  disconnect  will  normally  take  place  before  any structural damage occurs.  Reference ATP-56(B) Annex ZA for KC-135 and Annex ZB for KC-10 boom envelope diagrams.  CAUTION:  Approaching boom limits at relatively high velocity can cause structural damage due to binding action of the boom nozzle.  (T-2) Table 8.2.  Boom Envelope Limits. Boom Envelope Limits KC-135 KC-10 Upper Limit:  20 Degrees Lower Limit:  40 Degrees Right and Left Limit:  10 Degrees Inner Limit:  6 Feet Outer Limit:  18 Feet Elevation Azimuth Telescopic Upper Limit:  20 Degrees Lower limit:  40 Degrees Right and Left Limit:  25 Degrees Inner Limit:  6 Feet Outer Limit:  21 Feet Note:  The lower limit (KC-135) is reduce to 35 when less than 4 units of boom trim are used. 8.12.  Rendezvous  Procedures:  Note:    To  enhance  visual  tanker  acquisition,  the  receiver  or ground  agency  controlling  the  rendezvous  may  request  the  tanker  to  jettison  fuel  (mark).    It should  only  be  used  if  a  receiver  low  fuel  state  or  other  similar  circumstances  require  the rendezvous be expedited.  (T-2) 8.12.1.  Refer to ATP-56(B) for a full description of rendezvous procedures. 8.12.2.  Rendezvous  B  and  C  procedures  will  not  be  trained  or  executed  by  USAF  aircraft.  Refer  to  ATP-56(B)  preliminaries.    WARNING:    When  adverse  weather  is  encountered  in the  rendezvous  area,  the  search  radar  should  be  used  for  weather  scan,  rather  than  for monitoring or directing the rendezvous.  (T-2) 8.12.3.  Normal  Rendezvous  Procedures.    Normal  rendezvous  procedures  and  reference information for the C-32B are as follows: 8.12.3.1.  Rendezvous Alpha (Anchor RV) ATP-56(B) Part 2 Annex 1A 82 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 8.12.3.2.  Rendezvous Delta (Point Parallel RV) ATP-56(B) Part 2 Annex 1D 8.12.3.3.  Rendezvous Golf (Enroute RV) ATP-56(B) Part 2 Annex 1G  8.12.4.  Alternate  Rendezvous  Means.    When  primary  means  are  not  available,  or  are  lost, alternate means will be utilized to perform the rendezvous.  When using alternate means, the tankers  and  receivers  will  fly  the  same  profiles  as  described  in  ATP-56(B).    The  following are  some  suggested  alternate  means  for  conducting  the  rendezvous.    The  various  alternate means  should  be  used  in  conjunction  with  each  other  when  equipment  availability  permits, and  when  practical,  to  ensure  a  successful  rendezvous  (i.e.,  common  VORTAC,  TACAN DME, Radar Beacon, and FAA/GCI advisories, etc).  (T-2) 8.12.4.1.  FAA/GCI  Facilities,  when  available,  may  be  used  for  vector  and  separation advisories.  (T-2) 8.12.4.2.  DME/Radial information  from  a  common  TACAN/VORTAC  may  be exchanged,  with  the  final  turn  to  refueling  track  being  accomplished  when  the  DME difference equals proper turn range.  (T-2) 8.12.4.3.  When adequate navigational checkpoints are available, tanker may adjust final orbit  pattern  to  arrive  over  the  ARCP  on  refueling  heading  at  receivers  ETA  to  the ARCP.   (T-2) 8.12.4.4.  As  soon  as  reliable  radio  contact  has  been  established  between  aircraft, DME/Radial information from a common TACAN/VORTAC station will be exchanged, if available.  (T-2) 8.12.5.  Descent and Closure.  The receiver will begin descent to an altitude 1,000 feet below the  assigned  air  refueling  altitude  no  later  than  the  ARIP.    The  receiver  should  descend  at 2,500  fpm.    Establish  Mach  0.85  or  310  KIAS,  whichever  is  lower,  through  level-off  to  a point two nms from the tanker.  This level-off altitude will be maintained until one nm from the tanker and visual contact has been established at which time a gradual climb to precontact position  will  be  initiated,  arriving  at  1/2  nm  in  trail  with  a  minimum  altitude  separation  of 500  feet.    The  receiver  should  maintain  310  KIAS  until  the  following  ranges  vs.    airspeed schedules apply.  (Table 8.3) (T-2) Table 8.3.  Airspeed Schedule. >1 nm 1 nm 1/2 nm Contact Mach 0.85 or 310 KIAS, whichever is lower Mach 0.83 or 290 KIAS, whichever is lower Mach 0.81 or 285 KIAS, whichever is lower Mach 0.80 or 275 KIAS, whichever is lower WARNING:  Tankers will maintain applicable contact air refueling airspeed during closure.  (T-1)  If  within one nm closure the tanker is off airspeed by more than ten knots and required to  decelerate or accelerate to obtain contact airspeed, the receiver pilot will be informed prior to  tanker airspeed changes. Note:  If the receiver is more than four nm in trail with the tanker, the airspeed may be, increased to 330 KIAS for closure.  The normal speed schedule should be resumed at 1 nm in trail. AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 83 8.12.5.1.  During deceleration, it is imperative the airspeed schedule be maintained.  The nonflying  pilot  will  pass  the  range  calls  to  the  receiver  pilot  at  three,  two,  one,  and  1/2 nm.  (T-2) 8.12.6.  Rendezvous  Overrun.    Upon  recognition,  either  aircraft  can  direct  or  terminate overrun  procedures.    Receiver  will  reduce  airspeed  to  255  KIAS  and  maintain  track  and altitude.    Tanker  will  increase  airspeed  to  310  KIAS,  maintain  altitude,  adjust  track  as required,  and  overtake  the  receiver.    After  overtaking  the  receiver  and  terminating  the overrun, the tanker will reduce the airspeed to 275 KIAS for final receiver closure.  (T-2) 8.12.6.1.  Early Arrival of Receiver.  In the event the receiver arrives ahead of the tanker at  the  ARIP,  ARCP,  or RV  point,  the  receiver  will  obtain  ATC  clearance  to  orbit  at  an altitude that ensures at least 1,000 feet separation between tanker and receiver.  (T-2) 8.13.  Additional  AAR Procedures.  The following information pertains to different aspects of AAR  including  Receiver  Pilot  Technique,  Fuel  Transfer  Rate,  Refueling  Formations,  Normal Crew Procedures, and Pilot Refueling Procedures.  (T-2) 8.13.1.  Slipway  Door  Procedures.    To  prevent  freezing,  the  slipway  door  should  be  cycled open and closed prior to passing 10,000 feet MSL.  (T-2) 8.13.2.  Receiver Pilot Technique.  The receiver pilot will establish a rate of deceleration in sufficient  time to  allow a zero rate of closure at  the precontact  position.  (T-1)   Note:   The receiver will stabilize in  the precontact position with  a zero rate of closure.   If the receiver fails to attain stabilized position, or it becomes apparent that a closure overrun will occur, a breakaway  will  be  initiated.    WARNING:    Failure  to  initiate  a  breakaway  under  closure overrun conditions can result in a mid-air collision.  Because of the magnitude of interrelated aerodynamic effects, flying two aircraft in close vertical proximity is not safe.  Upwash and downwash effects may occur drawing the aircraft together.  Low-pressure areas created by an overrunning  receiver  flying  under  the  tanker  will  affect  static  ports  causing  possible erroneous airspeed and altitude indications to both aircraft.  The tanker autopilot altitude hold function may sense the low pressure as a climbing indication and initiate a descent into the lower aircraft.  (T-2) 8.13.3.  Once  the  precontact  position  is  attained,  the  receiver  pilot  should  make  necessary corrections to line the receiver up with the tanker fuselage centerline and dampen all relative lateral  movement  of  the  receiver  aircraft.    Closure  from  precontact  to  the  contact  position should  be  made  very  slowly  (approximately  1  foot  per  second)  to  enable  both  the  tanker pilot/autopilot and the receiver pilot to compensate for the required trim changes.  The proper technique  is  to  fly  formation  using  the  forward  fuselage  and  wings  of  the  tanker  as  visual references, crosscheck the pilot director light signals, and use the boom operator’s directions as  necessary  to  judge  the  location  of  the  receiver  in  the  envelope.    Anytime  lateral movement,  pitch  oscillations,  or  rate  of  closure  become  excessive,  reduce  power  and  drop back  into  precontact  position  and  stabilize  the  aircraft.    As  the  receiver  reaches  the  contact position, the receiver pilot should hold a steady platform until the boom is in the slipway.  If the pilot  director lights  fail to  illuminate when contact  is  established, the receiver pilot  will inform  the  boom  operator  if  he  wishes  to  continue  refueling  operations.    If  refueling  is continued, verbal corrections from the boom operator may be requested.  Attempts to affect a contact during loss of any AAR lighting that results in less than desired illumination will be at the discretion of the boom operator.  (T-2) 84 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 8.13.4.  The  AAR  boom  envelope  is  the  operational  limits  dictated  by  the  aerodynamic control  authority  of  the  boom.    Rough  usage  of  controls  on  the  part  of  either  receiver  or tanker  pilot  will  cause  a  chain  reaction  with  progressively  larger  corrections  required  to maintain  position.    Therefore,  development  of  a  smooth  technique  is  necessary.    Envelope limits  are set well within mechanical  limits  of the boom  so that a disconnect  will normally take  place,  soon  enough  to  allow  ample  time  for  a  separation.    Avoid  extreme  azimuth disconnects  at  all  times.    Reference  ATP-56(B)  Annex  ZA  for  KC-135  and  Annex  ZB  for KC-10 boom  envelope diagrams.    CAUTION:    Approaching boom  limits  at  relatively high velocity can cause structural damage as a result of an inability to disconnect due to binding action of the boom nozzle.  (T-2) 8.13.5.  Pilot  director  lights  are  used  in  conjunction  with  visual  references  to  maintain  the optimum  position.    The  receiver  pilot  must  be  familiar  with  operation  of  the  pilot  director lights and the fact that they do not give true vertical and horizontal information. 8.13.6.  Turns and banks may be made during contact without disconnects provided no large or abrupt motions or throttle movements are made by either tanker or receiver. 8.13.7.  The  lateral  control  spoilers  introduce  a  pitch  up  movement,  but  during  AAR operations,  this  characteristic  is  not  objectionable.    During  AAR  in  rough  air,  it  may  be necessary to apply a small amount of elevator to offset the pitch tendency if a large amount of lateral correction is rapidly made. 8.13.8.  Maintain position by  making small  anticipated corrections.  Once the  receiver pilot establishes  his  visual  references,  a  crosscheck  between  the  pilot  director  lights  and  any change in position indicated by visual references will indicate the magnitude and direction of corrections.    As  a  guide,  the  movement  of  the  nose  of  the  tanker  may  be  used  to  gauge required elevator inputs.  Lateral control is accomplished by proper aileron inputs to maintain a parallel wing condition with the tanker.  Power corrections are based upon the magnitude and direction of any movement fore or aft relative to the tanker. 8.13.9.  Pilot Fatigue.  One of the greatest potential hazards during AAR is fatigue.  If for any reason large oscillations develop which require increasing amounts of control displacement, disconnect and let the other pilot fly the aircraft in the precontact position for a few minutes.  The time spent in  stabilizing and resting will result in  better air refueling in  a shorter time, since fewer disconnects will be experienced. 8.14.  Disconnect.  There are two major classifications of disconnects; planned and inadvertent.  Planned  disconnects  may  be  initiated  by  the  receiver  pilot,  copilot,  or  tanker  boom  operator activating the disconnect switch.  Disconnects may be initiated by the receiver if less than a full load is required, if a malfunction is suspected, or for training purposes.  If a prearranged quantity of fuel is to be transferred, the disconnect will be initiated by the tanker boom operator after the planned amount of fuel is transferred and the receiver pilot is notified.   8.14.1.  Inadvertent  disconnects  may  be  caused  by  exceeding  the  refueling  boom  envelope limits.    A  pressure  disconnect  switch  will  cause  a  disconnect  if  excessive  pressure  surges occur either from transfer pressure or when the selected tanks become full and the high-level float  switches  close.    Upon  disconnect,  the  boom  will  automatically  retract,  except  when using manual boom retract. AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 85 8.14.2.  When  a  disconnect  occurs,  the  disconnect  light  illuminates  and  the  contact  made light goes out.  In case of an inadvertent disconnect, depress and release the reset button for the ready light.  The blue ready light will illuminate, the amber disconnect light will go out, and the green contact made light will be out. 8.14.3.  To disconnect in an emergency, the receiver pilot and copilot must be prepared at all times  to  press  the  autopilot/AAR  boom  disconnect  buttons.    CAUTION:    Unless  a  serious emergency arises, every effort should be made to stay in contact position until certain that the boom  is  clear  of  the  receptacle.    Remain  stabilized  in  the  contact  position  until  the  boom operator or pilot not flying the aircraft visually confirms a disconnect has been made.  This will prevent damage to the boom and/or receptacle through a brute force disconnect.   Note:  In the event of failure to obtain a contact and after each disconnect, the receiver will move aft and stabilize in a position in trail of the boom or in pre-contact position, reset AAR system and await boom operator signal to return to the contact position.  (T-2) 8.15.  Air Refueling Formations.  Refer to ATP-56(B) Part 2 Annex 2D.  (T-2) 8.16.  Emergency  Air  Refueling  Procedures.  The  following  paragraphs  describe  emergency AAR  procedures  including  tanker  aborts,  emergency  disconnects,  systems  malfunctions,  and breakaway procedures. 8.16.1.  Tanker Abort.  A tanker aborting during air refueling will inform the receiver and the tanker  lead  (if  necessary),  and  make  a  slow  descending  turn  to  clear  the  formation  and proceed on briefed route or take action as required by the abort. 8.16.2.  If a receiver aborts, all available means will be used to advise the tanker, particularly if radio contact between tanker and receiver has not been established.  When in radio contact with  tanker, an aborting  receiver will advise tanker leader so that appropriate action can be taken.  (T-2) 8.16.3.  Emergency  Disconnect.    The  receiver  pilot  must  be  prepared  to  press  the  boom disconnect switch at all times while flying AAR.  The other hand must be readily available for  immediate  throttle  actuation  in  the  event  of  a  breakaway.    Unless  a  serious  emergency arises,  every  effort  should  be  made  to  stay  in  contact  position  until  certain  that  the  boom nozzle is clear of the receptacle.  (T-2) 8.16.4.  Systems  Malfunctions.    If  a  tanker  AAR  system  malfunction  precludes  transfer  of fuel during AAR, the tanker will stow the boom, inform the receiver, and state the amount of fuel transferred.  Remaining tankers with operational AAR systems and transferable fuel will advise the tanker leader as to the amount of fuel  that can be transferred.   Note:    When any system  malfunction  or  condition  exists  which  could  jeopardize  safety,  AAR  will  not  be accomplished  except  during  fuel  emergencies  or  when  continuance  of  AAR  is  dictated  by operational necessity.  (T-2) 8.16.5.  AAR System Failure: 8.16.5.1.  Failure to Disconnect.  It is possible, though not probable, that the tanker signal system may change to disconnect while the receiver signal system stays in contact-made.  For  this  remote  possibility  and  other  emergencies  which  might  arise,  the  receiver  pilot must  be  prepared  at  all  times  to  press  his  autopilot/AAR  boom  disconnect  switch instantly.  (T-2) 86 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 8.16.5.2.  Manual  Boom  Latching.    If  either  the  boom  operator  or  the  receiver  pilot  is unable to accomplish disconnect or if the blue ready-for-contact light stays ON or comes back ON after contact has been established, the receiver must place the signal amplifier power switch in the override position and inform the boom operator of UARRSI failure.  In  this  condition  the  receiver  pilots  are  the  ones  capable  of  performing  a  disconnect.  Continuation  of  refueling  in  this  condition  is  for  operational  missions  only  and  will comply with the procedures below.  Note:  An AAR system malfunction is indicated by the blue ready-for-contact light staying on or coming back on.  In certain cases; however, a malfunction may occur and not be indicated in this manner.  (T-2) 8.16.5.2.1.  Inform tanker crew that AAR will take place with receiver signal amp in override mode.  (T-2) 8.16.5.2.2.  Fly  receiver  into  contact  position  with  signal  amplifier  power  switch  in OVRD position.  OVRD Light - On.  Ready (Blue) Light - On.  (T-2) 8.16.5.2.3.  Boom  operator  will  place  boom  nozzle  in  bottom  of  air  to  air  refueling receptacle and advise receiver pilot, "(Tanker call sign) contact." (T-2) 8.16.5.2.4.  Contact-Made (Green) Light - On.  (T-2) 8.16.5.2.5.  Receiver  pilot  will  advise  tanker  boom  operator  "(Receiver  call  sign) contact." (T-2) 8.16.5.2.6.  Proceed  with  normal  AAR  methods.    Tanker  boom  operator  will  advise receiver pilot of corrective action to be used to remain within AAR envelope.  (T-2) 8.16.5.2.7.  When  fuel  transfer  has  been  completed,  tanker  boom  operator  will  call, "(Tanker call sign) disconnect.” (T-2) 8.16.5.2.8.  Receiver  pilot  will  disconnect  by  depressing  boom  disconnect  button  to release toggles and inform tanker boom operator.  "(Receiver call sign) disconnect." CAUTION:    The  boom  operator  is  unable  to  release  the  boom  toggles  during  SIG AMP OVRD.  (T-2) 8.16.5.3.  Brute  Force  Disconnect.    There  are  two  types  of  brute  force  disconnect, controlled  tension  and  inadvertent.    Refer  to  ATP-56(B)  Part  2  Annex  ZA  for descriptions.    Note:    A  brute  force  disconnect  is  a  last  resort.    CAUTION:    It  is  not necessary  to  jerk  the  boom  out  with  IDLE  power  and  speed  brakes.    This  method  has caused  serious  structural  damage.    A  gradual  reduction  in  power  will  suffice  to disconnect.  (T-2) 8.16.5.4.  Pressure  Refueling.    Inoperative  Boom/Receptacle  Latching.    When  all  other recognized  means  of  fuel  transfer  have  failed,  and  a  bona  fide  fuel  shortage  emergency aboard  the  receiver  aircraft  exists,  fuel  can  be  transferred  maintaining  boom/receptacle contact  using  a  slight  extend  pressure  on  the  boom  telescope  lever.    Note:    Prior  to attempting this method of transferring fuel, the boom operator will brief the receiver pilot and thoroughly coordinate the procedures to be used.  Both tanker and receiver crews will monitor the refueling with extreme caution.  (T-2) 8.16.5.4.1.  The  boom  operator  must  apply  only  the  minimum  required  extend pressure  to  maintain  adequate  boom/receptacle  seal,  preventing  excessive  fuel leakage.    Unusual  and  varying  trim  changes  may  be  required  of  both  tanker  and AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 87 receiver  aircraft.    Excessive  pressure  may  push  receiver  aircraft  outward  and  place undue stress on the boom telescope mechanism.  (T-2) 8.16.5.4.2.  The  boom  operator  must  anticipate  receiver  relative  movement  to maintain contact during  receiver deceleration and must be  especially  alert to  relieve extend pressure during sudden receiver closure.  (T-2) 8.17.  Breakaway Procedure:  Refer to ATP-56(B) Part 2 Chapter 4. 8.17.1.  Relative  position  of  both  aircraft  must  be  closely  monitored  by  all  crew  members during all phases of AAR.  When either a tanker or receiver crew member determines that an abnormal  condition  exists  which  requires  an  immediate  separation  of  the  aircraft,  they  will transmit  the  breakaway  call  on  AAR  frequency.    This  will  include,  but  not  be  limited  to, excessive rate of closure, closure overrun, and engine failure.  (T-2) 8.17.2.  The  aircraft  do  not  necessarily  have  to  be  in  contact-made  to  call  a  breakaway.  During  loss  of  communications,  the  crew  member  desiring  a  breakaway,  or  observing  the tanker initiating a breakaway, will transmit the breakaway call on interphone.  (T-2) 8.17.3.  For  all  breakaways,  transmit  the  tanker's  call  sign  and  the  word  "Breakaway"  three times (Example:  "TERRA 32, breakaway, breakaway, breakaway") and simultaneously take the following actions, as indicated.  (T-2) 8.17.4.  Receiver  Pilots.    Both  pilots  actuate  disconnect  switches.    The  pilot  flying  position throttles to IDLE and establish a definite rate of descent; add drag, if necessary.  Avoid under flying the tanker if possible and drop aft of tanker until entire tanker is in sight.  Then pilot flying  should  monitor  flight  instruments  while  pilot  not  flying  monitors  the  tanker.  WARNING:  The receiver pilot should use caution not to overrun the tanker.  If overrunning does occur, under no conditions should a turn, either right or left, be made until breakaway has been completed.  (T-2) 8.18.  Post AAR.  Refer to ATP-56(B) Part 1 (definition) and Part 2 Chapter 1. 8.18.1.  The tanker will give post AAR information to the receiver as required.  The receiver will  advise  the  tanker  of  any  pilot  director  light  malfunctions/deficiencies,  e.g.,  lights intermittent, inoperative, dim, dirty, etc.  Upon termination of AAR, all exterior lights will be operated  as  required.    WARNING:    If  required  to  accelerate  and  climb  on  the  refueling heading the receiver will maneuver either left or right (minimum of one nm) of the tanker(s) prior to accelerating and climbing.  This will preclude the departing receiver’s jet wash from causing injury to personnel or damage to the tankers.  (T-2) 8.19.  KC-10  AAR  Procedures.  The  following  items  of  information  are  provided  to  amplify only the differences to KC-135 tanker procedures contained herein. 8.19.1.  Pilot Director Lights, KC-10.  The pilot director lights consist of two rows of lights located forward of the wing root.  Relative elevation position is provided by the left row and the  right  row  provides  telescoping  position.    The  elevation  row  contains  one  striped  green, two amber, and two red triangular panels, and two white letters, (U) for up and (D) at the aft end  for  down.    The  colored  panels  and  letters  are  dimly  illuminated  by  background  lights.  The  telescoping  row  contains  one  striped  green,  two  amber,  two  red,  and  four  white rectangular panels and two white letters, (A) at the aft end for Aft, and (F) at the aft end for Forward.    The  colored  panels  do  not  have  background  lighting;  however,  the  letter  at  each 88 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 end of the row is dimly illuminated.  Separation is provided by the white panels.  The pilot director lights  are  adjusted by the boom  operator to  the size air to  AAR envelope, for each receiver and provide guidance during contact. 8.19.2.  To  provide  more  response  time,  the  appropriate  panel  and  letter  are  illuminated  in anticipation  of  receiver  movement.    The  director  lights  provide  commands  based  on  both receiver  position  and  rate  of  movement.    With  rapid  motions  of  the  receiver  the  lights  can show a correction required even though the receiver is in the center of the envelope.  The red panel and letter at the ends of each row can be illuminated by the boom operator to aid the receiver in attaining the contact position. 8.19.3.  Handling  Characteristics.    More  power  will  be  required  to  maintain  position  than usual  behind  a  KC-135  tanker.    A  stronger  centering  tendency  exists  behind  the  KC-10  as compared to the KC-135 when the receiver is left or right of the tanker centerline. 8.19.4.  Disconnect.  The KC-10 aerial refueling boom is controlled by a digital fly-by-wire system.  Certain  failure  conditions  of this system  may  cause one or more axis  of the boom control system to become inoperative.  Should this occur, the boom operator may not be able to  maneuver  the  boom  to  avoid  striking  the  receiver  aircraft.    In  this  situation,  the  boom operator  will  direct  the  receiver  to  a  position  where  a  safe  disconnect  can  be  effected.  WARNING:    When notified that a KC-10 boom  flight  control system  failure has occurred, do  not  initiate  a  disconnect  unless  directed  by  the  boom  operator.    Follow  the  boom operator's instructions explicitly.  To reduce the probability of boom strike after disconnect, it may be necessary to  remain in  a stabilized position to  allow for aerodynamic fairing of the boom control surfaces.  WARNING:  Due to the possibility of causing uncommanded boom movement, no HF transmissions are to be made when in close proximity or connected to the KC-10 boom.

Prior to publication, forward a copy of all supplements to AFSOC/A3VS.  (T-2) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 95 Chapter 11 PILOT PROCEDURES AND FORMS 11.1.  Not Used. 96 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 Chapter 12 LOADMASTER PROCEDURES AND FORMS 12.1.  General.  In  addition  to  the  duties  established  in  the  FCOM  Volume  1  and  other directives,  the  loadmaster  will  comply  with  the  procedures  and  duties  in  this  regulation.    (T-1)  The PIC may assign other duties as necessary.  The loadmaster will:  (T-2) 12.1.1.  Coordinate  loading  and  offloading  with  air  terminal  operations  or  the  shipping agency.  (T-2) 12.1.2.  Load plan and supervise loading, tiedown, and offloading of cargo, baggage, mission equipment, and passengers.  (T-2) 12.1.3.  Be assigned to the crew anytime passengers or cargo are being transported aboard the aircraft.   MAJCOM/A3  may  waive  this  requirement  when  necessary  for  mission accomplishment.  (T-2) 12.2.  Responsibility for Aircraft Loading:  (T-2) 12.2.1.  Shippers are responsible for providing documentation for cargo and personnel.  They will  advise  the  loadmaster  of  size,  weight  and  type  of  cargo  (classified,  hazardous,  etc.), coordinate  traffic  activities  that  may  affect  loading  and  offloading,  and  assign  sufficient personnel  for  cargo  handling.    Shippers,  under  the  aircraft  loadmaster’s  supervision  are responsible  for  safe  positioning  of  material  handling  equipment  and  cargo  to  and  from  the aircraft.    If  cargo,  aircraft  equipment,  or  aircraft  structure  is  damaged  during  loading  or offloading, or if loading personnel are injured, the loadmaster will stop the loading operation and notify the PIC.  (T-1) 12.2.2.  The  loadmaster  is  responsible  for  aircraft  preflight,  load  planning,  preparation  of weight  and  balance  forms,  operation  of  aircraft  equipment,  coordination  with  loading  crew supervisor  for  inspection  of  cargo  and  documentation,  and  supervision  and  direction  of loading, offloading, and tiedown.  The loadmaster directs loading and is responsible for safe movement of cargo into and out of the aircraft.  (T-2) 12.3.  Emergency  Exits  and  Safety  Aisles.  Load  aircraft  in  such  a  manner  that  the  following emergency exits are available:  (T-2) 12.3.1.  At  least  one  unobstructed  emergency  exit  per  20  passengers.    At  least  two unobstructed emergency exits equipped with escape slides must be useable (one forward and one aft).  (T-2) 12.3.2.  When  cargo  or  baggage  is  being  loaded  into  the  aircraft  cabin,  allow  for  a  clear emergency egress aisle from the cockpit door to the aft most exit.  (T-2) 12.4.  Air  Cargo  Restraint  Criteria.  Cargo  will  be  loaded  and  restrained  in  the  cargo  holds when possible.  A safety belt or other tiedown strong enough to prevent shifting of cargo under all normal flight and ground conditions may be used.  (T-2) 12.4.1.  Cargo hold compartmental netting will be used to secure cargo when available.  (T-2) 12.5.  Passenger Handling:  (T-2) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 97 12.5.1.  The  loadmaster  is  the  key  figure  concerning  good  passenger  relations,  and  is responsible  for  the  passenger's  safety  and  security  during  loading,  offloading  and  flight.  Loadmasters  are  also  responsible  for  ensuring  only  authorized  personnel  are  allowed  on board the aircraft.  Be aware of any doubts and fears that may arise in the minds of personnel and anticipate their questions and actions.  Offer support and perform duties in a professional manner and show a personal interest and willingness to assist passengers.  (T-2) 12.5.2.  Passengers may move about the cabin, however, judgment must be exercised on the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at one time.  Encourage passengers to keep seat  belts  fastened  when  seated.    If  passengers  are  allowed  to  move  freely  in  the  cabin  at cruise  altitude  good  judgment  must  be  exercised  allowing  the  crew  access  to  emergency equipment.  In all such cases a clear aisle way from the front of the aircraft to the rear of the aircraft must be maintained at all times.  (T-2) 12.5.3.  Do not allow passengers to lounge on or tamper with equipment, cargo, or baggage.  Additionally passenger bags will be stored in the overhead bins or under the seats in front of them for takeoffs and landings.  (T-2) 12.5.4.  Make frequent checks on the cabin temperature and the cleanliness of the cabin and lavatories.    Special  emphasis  must  be  placed  on  removing  and  properly  securing  or destroying all classified or sensitive refuse.  (T-2) 12.5.5.  On  flights  of  long  duration,  particularly  during  hours  of  darkness,  use  all  possible means to make passengers comfortable.  Dim lights and extinguish unnecessary cabin lights.  (T-2) 12.5.6.  Passengers  may  visit  the  flight  deck  when  approved  by  the  PIC.    Good  judgment must be used when authorizing cockpit visitation.  (T-2) 12.5.7.  Any  time  passengers  are  on  board,  one  loadmaster  will  be  awake  to  monitor passenger  activities  and  maintain  cabin  discipline  and  safety.    While  on  the  ground  the AMSS  will  monitor  all  passengers  if  both  loadmasters  are  required  for  loading  operations.  (T-2) 12.6.  Border  Clearance.  Customs,  Immigration,  and  Agriculture  require  certain  forms  for border clearance.  The loadmaster is the custodian of all border clearance forms.  Distribute the forms to the crew and passengers and ensure their completion prior to landing.  A crew member will give completed forms to proper authorities.  (T-2) 12.7.  Weight and Balance:  (T-2) 12.7.1.  Responsibility  for  the  weight  and  balance  rests  with  the  pilot,  although  this  is normally delegated to the loadmaster.  The index system for calculating weight and balance will be used.  The primary loadmaster onboard is responsible for ensuring a center of gravity (CG)  is  computed  and  presented  to  the  cockpit  prior  to  engine  start.    Canned  weight  and balance  forms  may  be  used  if  they  reflect  the  current  crew,  fuel,  passengers,  and  cargo onboard.    For  home  station  departures,  a  copy  of  the  weight  and  balance  is  normally  filed with the pre-mission paperwork.  On continuing missions, the completed weight and balance form  is  maintained  onboard  and  properly  disposed  of  when  no  longer  needed.    Note:    The loadmaster  will  make  every  effort  to  notify  the  AMSS  with  the  following  information.  (Crew  count,  passenger  count,  cargo  load,  and  any  other  pertinent  information  deemed 98 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 necessary) The AMSS will relay the information to command and control agency as soon as practical.  (T-2) 12.7.2.  Unit DOV is the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for weight and balance.  All weight and balance books will be maintained and updated by the OPR and a copy provided to AFSOC/A3VS.  Each weight and balance book will be reviewed semi-annually for currency.  (T-2) 12.8.  Loadmaster Forms.  All forms are maintained in the loadmaster trip kit.  The kit contents will be checked prior to  departure from home station to ensure sufficient  quantities of required forms.  Required forms are specified on the index sheet located in the loadmaster trip kit.  Unit DOV is OPR for the loadmaster trip kit.  (T-2) 12.9.  Emergency Equipment.  Emergency equipment requirements are identified in the aircraft operations  manual,  loadmaster's  preflight  checklist,  and  aircraft  Minimum  Equipment  List (MEL).  (T-2) 12.10.  Aircraft  Tiedown  Equipment.  Required  tiedown  equipment  is  identified  in  the loadmaster's preflight checklist.  (T-2) 12.11.  Baggage  Loading  System.  The baggage loading system is designed to load baggage at austere  locations  that  do  not  have  adequate  material  handling  equipment  available.    The loadmaster must coordinate with the aircraft/mission commander prior to employing the system.  (T-2) 12.11.1.  The Boeing Cargo Loading Manual provides a chart showing the acceptable length, width, and height of baggage that can safely be loaded in the aft cargo hold.  This chart does not reflect reductions of the cargo door opening due to the installment of the baggage loading system.  This chart may still be used for planning purposes, but may not accurately reflect the actual  L  x  W  x  H  of  an  item  to  be  loaded.    There  are  too  many  variables  involved  (i.e., connecting  material,  stretch  factors,  angle  of  insertion)  to  provide  a  chart  for  all  scenarios.  The loadmaster must use experience to know if a piece of cargo can be loaded.  If any doubt arises in the safe execution of loading an item, immediately terminate loading operations and notify the PIC.  (T-2) 12.11.2.  If multiple items are to  be loaded, use a drift strap hooked to  the item  and a floor ring to position the item forward or aft in the cargo compartment.  (T-2) 12.11.3.  The loadmaster will inspect all components of the baggage loading system prior to use.    Only  qualified  loadmasters  or  crew  members  under  the  supervision  of  an  instructor loadmaster will utilize this system.  (T-2) the  baggage loading  system, 12.11.4.  When  using loadmasters  will  wear  gloves.  WARNING:  When lifting items, ensure area under and around the item is clear of personnel.  WARNING:    Prior to raising an item into the aircraft, ensure area is  clear and there are no obstacles in the cargo hold that would hinder the safe movement of the cargo.  WARNING:  Ensure all required pins  on the winch carriage are installed and track pins  engaged prior to any load being applied.  WARNING:  Ensure a minimum of four wraps of cable is placed on the winch drum assembly prior to any load being applied.  (T-2) 12.12.  Emergency Airlift:  (T-2) AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 99 12.12.1.  Use these procedures for emergency airlift of personnel for humanitarian reasons or from areas faced with enemy siege, hostile fire, or when directed by AFSOC.  Airlift can be accomplished  without  the  use  of  individual  seats  or  safety  belts  only  when  more  personnel than seats are available.  (T-2) 12.12.2.  The number of personnel seated within the cabin or cargo area will vary depending on individual size.  If possible, seat personnel in rows facing forward and restrain with straps placed  across  the  aircraft  floor.    Secure  the  straps  to  tiedown  rings  positioned  in  the  most outboard seat track(s).  (T-2) 12.12.3.  If time allows, personal effects or baggage may be loaded on the aircraft.  However, this may reduce the amount of personnel space available.  (T-2) 12.12.4.  The  maximum  altitude  for  emergency  airlift  of  personnel  is  FL  420  provided oxygen is available for each individual.  (T-2) 12.13.  Specific Loadmaster Responsibilities.  The loadmaster trip kit will be inventoried prior to  home  station  departure.    Ensure  kit  contains  sufficient  quantities  of  required  forms.    The inbound loadmaster will leave a memo or note (in an obvious location) inside the kit, indicating all items that are missing, broken, require restocking, etc.  The outbound loadmaster will review the note prior to crew stations time.  (T-2) 12.13.1.  Normally, the primary loadmaster is not indicated on the flight orders.  During the initial  crew  briefing,  the  primary  loadmaster  will  be  identified.    The  primary  loadmaster  is the highest qualified loadmaster logging primary, instructor or evaluator time.  The primary loadmaster  is  responsible  for  safe  mission  accomplishment.    There  may  be  times  when  a qualified loadmaster is acting as the primary loadmaster, but overall responsibility rests with the actual primary loadmaster.  (T-2) 12.13.2.  Due to the unit's alert requirements, every effort must be made by each loadmaster to ensure the alert aircraft is mission capable at all times.  (T-2) 12.13.3.  PICs  and  loadmasters  will  make  every  effort  to  provide  the  command  and  control agency a current passenger manifest or passenger count prior to each takeoff.  (T-2) 12.14.  Boldface/Critical Action Procedures.  See Attachment 7. 100 AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 Chapter 13 AIRBORNE MISSION SYSTEMS SPECIALIST PROCEDURES AND FORMS 13.1.  General.

Operational  Control  (OPCON)—Transferable  command  authority  that  may  be  exercised  by commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is inherent in combatant command (command authority). Operational control may be delegated and is  the  authority  to  perform  those  functions  of  command  over  subordinate  forces  involving organizing  and  employing  commands  and  forces,  assigning  tasks,  designating  objectives,  and giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes authoritative  direction  over  all  aspects  of  military  operations  and  joint  training  necessary  to accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be exercised through the  commanders  of  subordinate  organizations.  Normally  this  authority  is  exercised  through subordinate  joint  force  commanders  and  service  and/or  functional  component  commanders. Operational  control  normally  provides  full  authority  to  organize  commands  and  forces  and  to employ those forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary to accomplish assigned missions. Operational; control does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training. Operational  Missions—A  mission  that  has  as  a  primary  purpose  the  direct  support  of contingencies, or HQ USSOCOM and its subordinate commands. Missions executed at or above TACC level.

Cockpit windows, door exits 3L/3R are secondary routes for crash landing/ditching.  In all cases, carefully assess the conditions. WARNING:  If the evacuation signal is not given from the cockpit and the cabin crew needs to initiate the evacuation; the Alert button on the phone handset must be depressed, letting the cockpit know that an evacuation is taking place.  When possible, notify the cockpit by the use of the interphone headset, telephone handset, or megaphone prior to initiating an evacuation.    Turn  on the emergency exit light switch at each evacuation station. WARNING:  All additional crew members/able bodied helpers will receive a thorough briefing as to the duties to be performed if any, during an evacuation.  If time permits, consideration should be given to obtain additional survival items (i.e., food, water, etc.) WARNING:  Exits not covered in this chart due to crew size will be delegated to able-bodied  helpers. WARNING:  The PIC will sweep the cabin from the front to rear ensuring all passengers have  evacuated and should then exit through the right aft entry door (4R) if possible. WARNING:  If assigned exits are blocked and all passenger assistance has been rendered, leave  the aircraft by any suitable exit. WARNING:  The term “EGRESS” requires deployment/use of aircraft airstairs egressing to a predetermined rally point.  The term “EVACUATION” requires immediate deployment and use of slide/raft, evacuating to a predetermined rally point.  In either case, the PIC or designated  representative will ensure all crew and passengers are accounted for. Note:  Prior to the last able bodied crew member departing the aircraft, ensure all crew members are capable of egressing.   AFI11-2C-32BV3  27 OCTOBER 2015 141 Attachment 7 C-32B PLANNED CRASH LANDING CHECKLIST Figure A7.1.
