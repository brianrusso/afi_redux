General.  This instruction provides policy and guidance for selecting, training, operational support, standardization and evaluation (stan/eval), and upgrading PTs.  It is an original source document for HAAMS and references aircraft flight manuals, manufacturer’s technical manuals, formal course instruction and other Air Force and DoD directives. 1.2.  AF Program Goal.  Provide in-flight physiological and operational support to aircrews and MEP performing un-pressurized operations at or above 20,000 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL) or as requested. 1.3.  Overview.  AF  HAAMS  personnel  are  specially  trained  Aerospace  &  Operational Physiology  (AOP)  officers  and  technicians  [Air  Force  Specialty  Code  (AFSC)  43A3/4  and 4M0X1] assigned to AMC.  The HAAMS program is funded by the Aerospace Operations Panel as a part of the Defense Health Program. The HAAMS Center is located at Little Rock AFB, AR and  organized  as  an  independent  flight  aligned  within  the  19th  Aerospace  Medicine  Squadron (AMDS). The AF HAAMS Center Director, Superintendent, PM, Stan/Eval, and Training cadre will  all  be  assigned  to  the  HAAMS  Center.  (T-3)  The  center  will  be  manned  by  full-time  PTs who  are  specifically  trained,  budgeted  and  equipped  to  provide  operational  support,  including meeting  short-notice  tasking(s)  if  necessary.  Serves  as  the  pilot  unit  for  UTCs  FFQBB  and FFQB1.    Per  AFI  41-209,  Medical  Logistics  Support  and  AFI  10-401,  Air  Force  Operation Planning  and  Execution,  the  pilot  unit  is  responsible  for  developing  and  maintaining  standard manpower and equipment allowance standards and logistic details for each UTC for which it has been assigned responsibility by the MRA.  See AF Tactics, Technique and Procedures 3-42.56, Tactical Doctrine for specific HAAMS deployment requirements. (T-2) 1.4.  Administration. 1.4.1.  Major  Commands  (MAJCOMs)  or  Combatant  Commanders  may  set  requirements more, but not less restrictive than specified in this instruction.  MAJCOM supplements must be coordinated and approved by the OPR of this regulation before publication. 1.4.2.  A  Training  Review  Panel  (TRP)  will  take  place  during  scheduled  Aerospace  and Operational Physiology Corporate Advisory Board (AOPCAB) meetings which occur at least once per year.  Minutes and special interest items (SII) will be tracked by the AOPCAB.  The TRP topics may include, but are not limited to: training, stan/eval, currency, compliance, unit type code (UTC) status, initiatives and manning. (T-3) 1.5.  Waivers. 1.5.1.  PTs fly as operational support flyers (OSF) and therefore must adhere to training and operational  requirements  outlined  in  AFI  11-202  Vol  1,  Aircrew  Training,  and  AFI  11-202 Vol 3, General Flight Rules.  More stringent requirements may be included in the AFI 11-2 mission  design  series  (MDS)-Specific  Vol  1  and  3.    In  regards  to  aircraft  specific requirements  or  qualifications,  waiver  requests  will  be  routed  IAW  their  MDS-specific guidance. (T-2)   6  AFI11-409  9 SEPTEMBER 2015 1.5.2.  When  guidance  in  this  AFI  conflicts  with  another  basic/source  document,  the  most restrictive  guidance  takes  precedence.    For  matters  where  this  AFI  repeats  information  in  a source document, follow waiver authority outlined in the basic/source document. 1.5.3.  The  AF  HAAMS  Director  will  be  contacted  anytime  training  and  operational requirements  and/or  responsibilities  are  in  question.    He/she  will  determine  if  a  waiver  is necessary. (T-2) 1.5.4.  For  matters  where  this  AFI  is  the  source  document  (i.e.,  HAAMS),  waiver  authority for non-tiered items is this instruction’s OPR. AFI11-409  9 SEPTEMBER 2015   7  Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

As  a  result,  they  must maintain  proficiency  in  their  knowledge,  skills  and  experience  to  be  fully  operational  and capable  of  supporting  various  types  of  “short-notice”  non-contingency  and  contingency tasking(s). 4.6.1.  Completion and documentation of CT is the responsibility of each individual PT (T-3). 4.6.2.  PTs will coordinate with schedulers and training section to ensure they are proficient on all tasks listed on the AF Form 3862. (T-3) 4.6.3.  Failure to accomplish CT items results in a non-current status.  Non-currency prohibits a  PT  from  accomplishing  unsupervised  HAAMS  flights.  Individuals  are  considered  non-current on the first day of the following month, quarter or year in which assigned CT is due (e.g., a quarterly event becomes non-current the first day of the next quarter). 4.7.  Read  File  Item  (RFI).  RFIs  are  under  the  purview  of  the  stan/eval  section  and  will  be written on AF Form 446 (or equivalent) to alert personnel to policy changes for technical orders,   22  AFI11-409  9 SEPTEMBER 2015 DoD  directives  or  AFIs  affecting  operations  and/or  training  programs.    Notifications  may  be used  to  provide  clarification  to  program  management  guidance  from  AFIs  or  other  directives.  RFIs remain in effect until rescinded by the AF HAAMS Center. (T-3) 4.7.1.  A  copy  of  current  RFIs  and  attachments  (if  applicable)  will  be  placed  in  PT’s HAAMS folders (paragraph 3.11). (T-3) 4.7.2.  Personnel will sign each RFI before supporting missions. (T-3) AFI11-409  9 SEPTEMBER 2015   23  Chapter 5 OPERATIONS 5.1.  Overview.  All unpressurized missions at or above FL200 MSL requires AF HAAMS MR trained  PTs  IAW  this  instruction,  Army  ATTP  3-18.11  Special  Forces  Military  Free-Fall Operations,  350-2  US  Army  Special  Operations  Command   Airborne  Training, COMNAVSPECWARCOMINST 3000.3B Navy Special Warfare Air Operations, and applicable Vol 3 of AFIs 11-2C-MDS.  Missions include but are not limited to DoD special operations high altitude  low  opening  and  high  altitude  high  opening  personnel  and  equipment  drops, psychological  operations,  equipment  testing  and  research  operations,  and  humanitarian  aid operations.  Regardless of altitude, personnel tasked to conduct PT duties will meet requirements outlined in this instruction. (T-2) 5.2.  HAAMS Personnel Description.  HAAMS PTs are specially trained technicians and AOP officers (AFSC 4M/43A3) who have completed training IAW Chapter 4. 5.3.  Ratio Requirements. 5.3.1.  One USAF MR PT is required for each 16 personnel (aircrew, parachutists, MEP etc.) on board the aircraft for all unpressurized missions conducted at or above 20,000 feet MSL. (T-2)  Note: Refer to MDS-specific volumes (e.g., AFI 11-2C-17, Vol 3) which may require more  restrictive  ratios.    Any  PT,  even  if  minimum  ratio  requirements  have  been  met,  must meet all requirements listed in paragraph 2.17 if he/she is providing HAAMS. 5.3.2.  Flight  examiners may be included in  PT ratio requirements and conduct  PT duties if necessary. However, their main objective is to conduct evaluations with limited distractions to meet intent of evaluation objectives outlined in Chapter 6. 5.3.3.  Support  for  high  altitude  missions  below  FL200  may  be  requested  to  mitigate  risks and is highly recommended. 5.4.  Requesting PT Support. 5.4.1.  All CONUS and OCONUS non-contingency requests for PT support must be made to the  AF  HAAMS  Center  workflow  email  address  19mdg/haams@us.af.mil  or  by  calling DSN 731-6093/Comm 501-987-6093. (T-2) 5.4.2.  Contingency tasking(s) will be formally tasked through AMC/SGX channels. (T-2) 5.5.  High Altitude Airdrop Oxygen Requirements. 5.5.1.  PTs  provide  support  on  various  types  of  aircraft,  both  military  and  civilian.  Regardless  of the type or origin  of the aircraft, oxygen requirements will be met  IAW AFI 11-202 Vol3 and this regulation. (T-2) 5.5.2.  Supplemental  Oxygen.    A  continuous  supply  of  supplemental  oxygen  using  an approved  individual  helmet  and  mask  will  be  used  by  all  personnel  during  unpressurized operations  above  10,000  feet  MSL.  (T-2)  EXCEPTIONS:  Parachutists  may  perform unpressurized  operations  between  10,000  feet  MSL  and  13,000  feet  MSL  without supplemental  oxygen  for  a  period  not  to  exceed  30  min.    For  unpressurized  flight  above   24  AFI11-409  9 SEPTEMBER 2015 13,000  feet  MSL,  or  exceeding  the  30-minute  envelope  between  10,000  and  13,000  feet MSL, a continuous supply of supplemental oxygen will be used. 5.5.3.  When the aircraft oxygen system does not provide sufficient oxygen regulators for all personnel, approved portable oxygen systems (e.g., oxygen consoles, hoses, masks, CRU-79 etc) will be inspected and installed in the aircraft.  The consoles will provide enough oxygen connections  for  all  crewmembers,  parachutists  or  other  MEP  not  accommodated  by  the normal aircraft oxygen system. (T-1) 5.6.  Pre-breathe Requirements for Missions at or Above FL200. 5.6.1.  All  personnel  will  pre-breathe  100  percent  oxygen  below  16,000  feet  MSL  cabin altitude  on  any  mission  scheduled  for  an  exposure  at  or  above  FL200  for  times  shown  in Table 5.1 (T-2) 5.6.2.  The PIC, with recommendations from the PT and primary jumpmaster (if applicable), will determine the course of action for a break in pre-breathing. (T-3) 5.6.3.  Pre-breathing  will be conducted with  a  personally-fitted oxygen mask attached to  an approved  helmet  and  personal  oxygen  system.    Note:  Emergency  oxygen  equipment  (e.g., MA-1, quick-don/smoke mask etc.) is not approved for pre-breathing. (T-1) 5.7.  Restrictions. 5.7.1.  Accumulative Total Time. This time begins and ends when cabin altitude is above and below  FL200  and  will  not  exceed  110  minutes.  Additional  flying  may  be  conducted  below FL200. (T-2) 5.7.2.  Maximum  Block  Exposure  Time.  Aircraft  cabin  altitude  time  limits  are  categorized into  blocks  of  altitude  and  are  listed  in  Table  5.1.  Additional  flying  may  be  conducted  at lower blocks of altitude. 5.7.3.  If the aircraft lands between sorties, and the time on the ground equals or exceeds the time  spent  at  or  above  a  cabin  altitude  of  FL200,  the  accumulative  total  or  block  time  (if applicable) of allowable duration can be reset to the maximum. 5.7.4.  No  more  than  3  pre-breather  sorties  in  a  24-hour  period  (take-off  to  landing)  unless otherwise restricted. (T-2) 5.7.5.  At least 24 hours between exposures to or above FL300. (T-2) 5.7.6.  Ascent rates will not exceed 5,000 ft/min. (T-2) Table 5.1.  Pre-breathing Requirements and Exposure Limits (T-1). Altitude (Note 1) Oxygen Requirement Pre-breathe Time Maximum Block Exposure Time (Note 2, 3) 10,000 ft - 12,999ft  Aircrew: Supplemental Jumpers: See para. 5.5.2.

Altitudes listed in MSL. 2. Aircraft must descend to a lower block (or below FL200) once the maximum block exposure time is met.  EXAMPLE – Planned drops at FL399, FL299, and FL249; time begins passing through FL200 and is limited to 30 minutes at FL399, descend to FL299 for 30 minutes (60 minutes accumulative), descend to FL249 for 50 minutes (110 minutes accumulative).  3. Limits based on not exceeding 23% decompression sickness (DCS) incidence under laboratory conditions (<1% operational impact such as abort or mission alteration/descent). 5.8.  Operations above FL250 feet MSL. 5.8.1.  A  waiver  to  AFI  11-202V3  is  required  from  AF  Flight  Standards  Agency  for unpressurized flights when conducting airdrops FL250 feet MSL and above. 5.8.2.  MA-1  portable  oxygen  units  equipped  with  A-21  regulators  (or  equivalent)  and serviceable  web-carrying  straps  will  be  provided  for  each  person  aboard  and  be  readily available except for parachutists. (T-1) 5.9.  Physiological Incidents.  USAF PTs are specially trained to handle various oxygen system malfunctions  and  physiological  incidents.    The  PT  will  make  every  attempt  to  resolve  the issue(s) and advise the PIC and primary jumpmaster (if applicable) of the safest course of action.  If the problem has been identified and/or signs and symptoms of the incident have been resolved, the  parachutist  and/or  aircrew  may  continue  training  with  PIC  and  jumpmaster  (if  applicable) concurrence.    While  these  malfunctions  and/or  incidents  may  not  meet  reportable  mishap classification  criteria,  it  is  important  to  investigate/report  for  hazard  identification  and  mishap prevention.  Therefore, the Trip  Lead will ensure events,  to  include physiological  incidents  are reported to the PIC or host installation chief of safety IAW AFI 91-204. (T-3)   26  AFI11-409  9 SEPTEMBER 2015 Chapter 6 STANDARDIZATION EVALUATION 6.1.  Purpose.  Provide  leadership  a  tool  to  validate  mission  readiness  and  the  effectiveness  of training,  including  documentation,  qualifications  and  capabilities.    This  chapter  provides procedures  and  evaluation  criteria/tolerances  to  be  used  during  evaluations.    Specific  areas  for evaluations  are  prescribed  to  ensure  an  accurate  assessment  of  proficiency  and  capabilities. HAAMS  instructors  will  use  this  chapter  during  IQT  and  MQT  to  prepare  NMR  PTs  for  their initial and subsequent MSN evaluations. (T-3) 6.2.  Conduct of Evaluations. 6.2.1.  Flight  examiners  will  pre-brief  the  examinee  on  the  purpose,  conduct,  requirements and  general  criteria  of  the  evaluation.    Flight  examiners  will  then  evaluate  the  examinee  in each area/sub-area. (T-3) 6.2.2.  Evaluations may be accomplished on operational or training missions.  Profiles must be  as  realistic  as  possible  and  relate  to  real-world  applications  with  minimum  number  of simulated events. 6.2.3.  Flight examiners should not evaluate personnel they have primarily trained nor should they evaluate personnel who serve as rating officers on their performance reports.  (T-3) 6.2.4.  Flight  examiners will note discrepancies and deviations from task grading forms  and performance criteria during the evaluation.  They will compare the examinee’s performance with the tolerances provided in the grading criteria and assign an appropriate grade for each area.  (T-3) 6.2.5.  An  evaluation  will  not  be  changed  to  a  training  mission  to  avoid  documenting substandard performance, nor will a training mission be changed to  an evaluation, with  the exception of a N/N (No Notice) evaluation.  (T-3) 6.2.6.  The  judgment  of  the  flight  examiner will  be  the  determining  factor  in  assigning  an    overall  qualification  level  on  the  AF  Form  8.    The  flight  examiner  should  thoroughly critique  all  aspects  of  the  flight.    During  the  critique,  the  examiner  will  review  the examinee’s  overall  rating,  specific  deviations,  area/sub-area  grades  assigned,  and  any additional training required. (T-3) 6.2.7.  In the event of unsatisfactory performance, the examiner will determine recommended additional  training  requirements.    Additional  training  on  the  same  mission  is  allowed  when unique situations presenting valuable training opportunities exist (i.e., another >FL200 sortie is scheduled).  This option requires examiner discretion and judicious application. The flight examiner who administered the original evaluation will not administer the recheck.  (T-3) 6.3.  Timing of Evaluations. 6.3.1.  Expiration  Date.  Required  periodic  evaluations  expire  on  the  last  day  of  the  17th month  following  the  month  in  which  the  flight  phase  was  successfully  flown  (e.g.  an evaluation completed 9 Oct 14 expires 31 Mar 16.). AFI11-409  9 SEPTEMBER 2015   27  6.3.2.  Eligibility  Period.  Periodic  evaluations  will  be  scheduled  by  Stan/Eval  Function within the eligibility period, defined as the 6-month period prior to the expiration date. Note: NMR PTs will complete their initial MSN Eval after completing MQT IAW Chapter 4. 6.3.3.  Out-of-the-Eligibility  Period.  On a case-by-case basis, periodic evaluations may be scheduled before or after the eligibility period according to the following criteria: 6.3.3.1.  Evaluations  Conducted  Prior  to  the  Eligibility  Period.  SQ/CCs  may authorize  individuals  to  complete  periodic  evaluations  prior  to  the  eligibility  period.  A description  of  the  circumstance(s)  is  required  on  the  back  of  the  Form  8  under  the approving officer’s remarks. (T-3) 6.3.3.2.  Extended  Evaluations.  SQ/CCs  may  extend  the  expiration  date  of  periodic evaluations  for  up  to  6  months  for  operational  reasons  (e.g.,  deployment).    An  MFR signed by the SQ/CC explaining the circumstance(s) will be placed in the PT’s HAAMS folder until an evaluation is completed. If possible, prerequisites (paragraph 6.6) will be accomplished  within  the  original  eligibility  period.  CT  requirements  (paragraph  4.6) must be accomplished before a member is scheduled for an evaluation. (T-3) 6.3.4.  Failure  to  Complete  an  Evaluation  within  the  Required  Period.  If  a  PT  fails  to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 6.3.2) or within the period for an out-of-the-eligibility  period  evaluation  (see  paragraph  6.3.3),  the  PT  is  considered  NMR. Depending  on  timeline  and  with  HAAMS  Director’s  approval,  MR  status  may  be  re-established by accomplishing a complete requalification evaluation (to include prerequisites) or by completion of the delinquent ground and/or flight phase of the evaluation. 6.4.  Categories.  Evaluations are divided into three categories: MSN, INSTR, and SPOT.  Each category consists of two structured phases, ground and flight.  EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations may  consist  of  either  a  ground  or  flight  phase.    Each  phase  requires  the  completion  of prerequisite  tasks  (see  paragraph  6.6).    EXCEPTION:  a  SPOT  evaluation  has  no  requisite tasks. 6.4.1.  MSN Evaluations. 6.4.1.1.  Verifies  IQT  and  MQT  Formal  Course  training  standards  are  adequate  in preparing NMR for their initial MSN evaluation. 6.4.1.2.  Qualifies PTs to conduct missions IAW this instruction. 6.4.2.  INSTR Evaluations. 6.4.2.1.  Qualify  PTs  who  meet  requirements  outlined  in  paragraph  4.5  of  this instruction. 6.4.2.2.  The  same  Flight  Evaluation  Checklist  and  grading  criteria  used  during  MSN evaluations  will  be  used  during  INSTR  evaluations  but  focus  will  be  placed  on  the individual’s leadership, skill-set, technical knowledge and instructional ability. (T-3) 6.4.2.3.  INSTR  evaluations  may  satisfy  periodic  evaluation  requirements  provided  all requirements for the periodic evaluation are met. 6.4.2.4.  Evaluations  of  instructor  qualification  will  be  conducted  during  all  subsequent periodic evaluations unless the examinee no longer holds INSTR status. (T-3)   28  AFI11-409  9 SEPTEMBER 2015 6.4.3.  SPOT Evaluations. 6.4.3.1.  Purpose/Execution.  Evaluate  a  specific  event  or  requirement  without  intending to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  a  periodic  evaluation.  A  SPOT  has  no  specific prerequisites, but may be N/N IAW paragraph 6.5.2. 6.4.3.2.  SPOT evaluations may consist of either a ground or flight phase. 6.4.3.3.  An  examinee  may  utilize  a  SPOT  evaluation  to  update  a  periodic  evaluation expiration  date  provided  all  requirements  for  the  evaluation  are  completed  within  the periods described in paragraph 6.3.  If all requirements were not completed on the first flight, subsequent flights are authorized to complete required events. 6.5.  Prefixes.  The  following  prefixes  will  be  used,  when  applicable,  to  further  describe  the evaluations listed in paragraph 6.4. (T-3) 6.5.1.  Requalification  (RQ).    An  evaluation  administered  to  remedy  a  loss  of  qualification due to expiration of a required periodic evaluation, a recheck following a failed evaluation or a commander-directed downgrade. 6.5.2.  No-Notice  (N/N).    The  N/N  evaluation  program  provides  leadership  a  sampling  of daily performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.  The examinee is notified of the evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission.  The intent is to preclude extraordinary preparation for the mission.  However, the flight examiner will not manipulate the pre-planned mission profile.  An examinee may utilize a N/N evaluation to  update  a  mission  evaluation  expiration  date  provided  that  all  requirements  for  the evaluation  are  completed  and  within  the  required  periods  IAW  paragraph  6.3.    If  all requirements  were  not  completed  on  the  first  flight,  subsequent  flights  are  authorized  to complete  required  events.    If  the  examinee  elects  not  to  update  a  mission  evaluation expiration date, the evaluation will be documented on the AF Form 8 (paragraph 3.10) as a N/N evaluation. 6.6.  Prerequisites.  These  include  ground  phase  items  and  must  be  accomplished  before  an evaluation is scheduled. (T-3) 6.6.1.  Ground  Phase.    This  phase  consists  of  open-book  and  closed-book  exams  and  EPE. MR PTs may schedule exams and EPE within a 6-month window from their evaluation due date. NMR PTs will accomplish all ground phase items during IQT.  NMR and MR PTs must pass all ground phase items prior to entering the flight phase. 6.6.1.1.  Open-Book Exam.  The exam will consist of at least 25 questions and is used to assess  PT’s  knowledge  and  ability  to  find  information  in  publications  (e.g.,  checklists, Formal  Course  training  standards,  TOs  and  AFIs  or  other  DoD  directives)  containing information  pertinent  to  the  operation  of  applicable  oxygen  systems,  physiology  and parachute  equipment.   It  will  also  include  aircraft  specific  limitations,  rigging configurations and aircraft operational questions for all applicable MDS platforms.  The open-book  subject  areas  and  the  publications  used  to  generate  the  exam  will  be  made available  to  PTs.    Electronic  publications  may  be  used  for  open-book  exams.    A minimum score of 80% is required to pass the open-book exam.  A failure results in an overall unqualified evaluation. AFI11-409  9 SEPTEMBER 2015   29  6.6.1.2.  Closed-Book  Exam.    The  exam  will  consist  of  at  least  25  questions  and  will include  questions  PTs  must  know  without  the  use  of  publications  (e.g.,  checklists,  TOs and/or  AFIs).    Closed  book  questions  will  emphasize  physiology,  hyperbarics,  oxygen system  knowledge  and flight  and  mission accomplishment.  A minimum score of 80% is required to pass the closed-book exam.  A failure results in an overall unqualified evaluation. information  necessary for safe 6.6.1.3.  Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE).  This pass/fail item evaluates a PT’s situational  awareness,  knowledge  of  physiology,  aircraft  EPs,  medical  procedures,  and parachute  and  aircraft  oxygen  equipment  with  scenario  based  questions.    Flight examiners  will  use  one  continuous  scenario  throughout  the  EPE  and/or  different scenarios  for  each  EP.    Satisfactory  performance  (Q-1)  for  EPEs  requires  taking  the proper action in the correct sequence, not a verbatim response.  Performances of EPEs are graded by qualification levels listed in paragraph 6.14. 6.6.2.  Ground Phase Failure.  A failure in any of the items (e.g., exams, EPE) results in an overall unsatisfactory evaluation and must be successfully re-accomplished.  A member will undergo  a  de-brief  and  must  be  afforded  an  adequate  study  period  prior  to  re-examination.  Document ground phase scores on AF Form 8 (paragraph 3.10).  Note: A separate AF Form 8 will be used for all rechecks. (T-3) 6.6.3.  Flight  Phase.    The  evaluation  flight  profile  will  include  a  personnel  drop  from >FL200.  If not available, the flight examiner may simulate a FL200 profile and procedures.  When  in-flight  evaluation  of  a  required  area  is  not  possible,  the  area  may  be  verbally evaluated.    Flight  examiners  will  make  every  effort  to  evaluate  all  required  areas  in-flight before resorting to this provision.  If an alternate method is used to complete the evaluation (e.g.,  flight  <FL200,  verbal  eval)  document  in  the  Additional  Comments  portion  of  the  AF Form 8. 6.6.3.1.  The  flight  examiner  must  grade  the  areas/subareas  listed  in  the  evaluation sections listed on the AF 3862. (T-3) 6.6.3.2.  In  addition  to  required  areas/subareas,  the  flight  examiner  will  grade  any area/subarea  observed  during  an  evaluation  if  performance  in  that  area/subarea  impacts the specific evaluation accomplished or overall flight safety. (T-3) 6.6.3.3.  Minor  momentary  deviations  are  acceptable,  provided  the  examinee  applies prompt  corrective  action  and  such  deviations  do  not  jeopardize  flight  safety.    Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade. 6.6.3.4.  The flight  examiner may  further identify any area/sub-area  as commendable if, in  the  examiner’s  determination,  the  member  demonstrated  exceptional  skill  and knowledge. 6.7.  Grading System. 6.7.1.  A two-step grading system is used to evaluate and document performance. 6.7.2.  In the first step, individual grades are assigned to each evaluation requisite to include the  grading  of  areas/subareas  of  individual  performance  against  established  evaluation criteria.  Performance less than fully qualified must be documented.   30  AFI11-409  9 SEPTEMBER 2015 6.7.3.  In the second step, an overall qualification level is assigned based on a compilation of all individual requisite grades. 6.8.  Tolerances.  Tolerances  (i.e.,  Q/Q-/U)  for  performance  areas/subareas  are  listed  and described in the HAAMS Formal Course task grading forms. 6.9.  Critical  Areas.  These  areas  require  adequate  accomplishment  by  the  member  in  order  to achieve the mission objectives successfully.  If a member receives an unqualified grade (i.e., U) in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will be unqualified (Q-3).  Critical areas are identified by the shading of the Q- block on the AF 3862, Flight Evaluation Worksheet. 6.10.  Performance Areas/Subareas. 6.10.1.  Areas/subareas  will  have  a  two-tier  (Q/U)  or  three-tier  (Q/Q-/U)  grading  system.  Discrepancies will be documented against the established areas/subareas. 6.10.2.  Q  is  the  desired  level  of  performance.    The  examinee  demonstrated  a  satisfactory knowledge  of  all  required  information,  performed  duties  within  the  prescribed  tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission. 6.10.3.  Q-  indicates  the  examinee  is  qualified  to  perform  the  assigned  area  but  requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the evaluator.  Deviations from established standards must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety. 6.10.4.  U  indicates  a  breach  of  flight  discipline,  performance  outside  allowable  parameters or  deviations  from  prescribed  procedures/tolerances  that  adversely  affected  mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety.  An examinee receiving an area of U requires additional training. 6.11.  Additional  Training.  Any  training  recommended  by  the  flight  examiner  to  remedy deficiencies  identified  during  an  evaluation.    This  training  may  include  self-study,  ground instruction, FuT or inflight instruction. 6.12.  Overall Qualification Levels.  The overall qualification level awarded on an evaluation is based on performance on both the flight and ground phases.  An overall grade of Q-1 or Q-2 will be  awarded  only  after  all  evaluation  requirements  have  been  completed  and  given  due consideration.  An overall grade of Q-3 may be awarded at any time.  Evaluators will document the  qualification  level  on  the  AF  Form  8.    Personnel  who  receive  a  Q-1  or  Q-2  are  considered MR  and  those  who  receive  a  Q-3  are  NMR.    Overall  evaluation  performance  is  graded  by qualification levels as follows: (T-3) 6.12.1.  Qualification  Level  1  (Q-1).    The  PT  demonstrated  desired  performance  and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the grading criteria.  This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if: 6.12.1.1.  The discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any area(s). 6.12.1.2.  In  the  judgment  of  the  flight  evaluator,  none  of  the  discrepancies  preclude awarding of an overall Q-1. 6.12.1.3.  All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during the debrief of that evaluation. AFI11-409  9 SEPTEMBER 2015   31  6.12.2.  Qualification Level 2 (Q-2).  PT demonstrated ability to perform duties safely, but: 6.12.2.1.  There were one or more area(s) where additional training was assigned. 6.12.2.2.  A non-critical area of U was awarded. 6.12.2.3.  In  the  judgment  of  the  flight  evaluator,  there  is  justification  based  on performance on one or several areas. 6.12.3.  Qualification  Level  3  (Q-3).    PT  demonstrated  an  unacceptable  level  of  safety, performance or knowledge. 6.12.3.1.  Failed Ground Phase. 6.12.3.2.  An  area  grade  of  U  awarded  in  a  critical  area  requires  an  overall  Q-3  for  the evaluation. 6.12.3.3.  An overall Q-3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight evaluator, there is justification based on performance in one or several areas. 6.13.  Exceptionally  Qualified  (EQ)  Designation.  An  EQ  may  be  given,  but  will  only  be applied  to  the  overall  grade  and  not  to  separate  requisite.    Document  on  the  AF  Form  8  IAW paragraph 3.10.  An EQ may be given when the PT: 6.13.1.  Demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in all phases of the evaluation; 6.13.2.  Did not fail any prerequisite and; 6.13.3.  Received a Q on all areas/subareas evaluated. 6.14.  Commander  Directed  Downgrade.  The  commander  of  HAAMS  PTs  may  direct  a downgrade (Q-/U) in a specific area/sub-area without unqualifying an individual.  Additionally, the commander may direct a downgrade that either removes a qualification (e.g. INSTR to MR PT)  or  completely  unqualifies  an  individual  (e.g.  MR  to  NMR).    Downgrades  may  be  directed without administering an evaluation using the following guidance: 6.14.1.  For  flying-related  cases,  use  for  cause  only  (e.g.,  breach  of  flying  discipline,  flight safety, evaluation critical area etc.).  Incidents may be witnessed by an MR PT or a qualified aircrew member. 6.14.2.  For  non-flying-related  cases,  do  not  use  as  a  substitution  for,  or  in  lieu  of, administrative or judicial actions (e.g.  Letter of Counseling, Article 15, etc.).  Consult  with the Staff Judge Advocate office for legal advice in these cases and in incidences that directly affect the commander’s confidence in the member’s ability to safely conduct PT duties (e.g. lapse  in  judgment  significant  enough  to  cast  doubt  on  the  PT’s  decision-making  abilities during HAAMS). 6.14.3.  For  downgrades  that  either  remove  qualifications  or  completely  unqualify  an individual, the affected PT will cease acting in the qualification from which they have been downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade. 6.14.4.  Commander Directed Downgrades will be documented IAW paragraph 3.10. (T-3)   32  AFI11-409  9 SEPTEMBER 2015 Chapter 7 PARACHUTING PROGRAM 7.1.  Purpose.  The  AF  HAAMS  Center  parachute  program  was  established to  meet requirements and responsibilities outlined in AFI 11-410 and this instruction.  Specifically, this program  will  increase  mission  effectiveness  and  safety  (AFI  11-410  paragraph  1.2.3.3.)  during parachute operations by  providing fully qualified HAAMS PTs for DoD missions (AFI 11-410 paragraph 2.5 and Chapter 4 of this instruction). 7.2.  Objectives.  The  AF  HAAMS  Center  MR  PTs  are  responsible  for  providing  mission essential  support  for  DoD  conventional  and  special  operations  forces  MFF  operations,  training and  test  and  evaluation  personnel  airdrops.    To  enhance  credibility  and  provide  more  effective user group operational support, the AF HAAMS Center will be manned with designated J-coded UMD  positions  authorizing  personnel  to  complete  airborne  training  and  conduct  routine  jump requirements.  (T-2)  To  meet  ETCA  HAAMS  IQT  course  and  CT  (paragraphs  4.3  and  4.6) requirements, MFF parachutists assigned to the HAAMS Center are required to serve as critical role-players  for  oxygen  jump  operations.  (T-2)  Additionally,  jump  personnel  serve  as AETC/A3FM’s SME for HAP standardized curriculum. (T-3) 7.3.  Sustainability.  The AF HAAMS Center Parachute Program will be manned and trained to be self-sufficient to sustain jump operations. (T-2) This includes qualified riggers and emergency medical technicians to support routine proficiency jumps and IQT and CT program requirements. Support  for  the  parachute  program  requires  training  advancement  in  parachute  ratings  which includes  the  following  courses:  US  Army  basic  airborne  (L9AZA1XXXX  0A1A),  static-line jumpmaster  (L9AZA1XXXX  0A0A),  MFF  parachutist  (L9AQA1XXXX  0F1A)  and  MFF jumpmaster (L9AZA1XXXX 1J0A). 7.4.  The program will be managed IAW AFI 11-410 and 11-402 (paragraph 1.  7.3.).  TOD D.
