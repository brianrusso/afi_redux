This  instruction  establishes  requirements  and  grading  criteria  for  ground  and flight phases of initial, requalification, and periodic flight evaluations. Aircrew evaluations will be conducted IAW this instruction and AFI 11-202, Vol 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program,  as  supplemented.    Specific  areas  for  evaluation  are  prescribed  to  ensure  an  accurate assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of aircrews.  Flight examiners use this AFI when conducting  aircrew  evaluations.    Instructors  use  this  AFI  when  preparing  aircrews  for qualification. 1.1.1.  The  Aircrew  Standardization  and  Evaluation  Program  is  the  commander’s  tool  to validate mission readiness  and the effectiveness  of unit flying, to  include documentation of individual  aircrew  member  qualifications  and  capabilities.    For  the  purposes  of  this instruction, the National Guard Bureau (NGB) is considered a Major Command (MAJCOM).   1.2.  Applicability.  This  instruction  applies  to  all  individuals  performing  crew  duties  on AFSOC/ANG C-32B aircraft.  (T-2) 1.3.  Key words and definitions. 1.3.1.  “Will” and “Shall” indicate a mandatory requirement. 1.3.2.  “Should”  is  normally  used  to  indicate  a  preferred,  but  not  mandatory,  method  of accomplishment. 1.3.3.  “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.3.4.  “Note”  indicates  operations  procedures,  techniques,  etc.,  considered  essential  to emphasize. 1.4.  Waivers.  Waiver  authority  for  directive  guidance  (will,  shall,  must,  etc.)  throughout  this regulation is tiered IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management..  IAW AFI 11202, Vol 2, the MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for individual aircrew requirements on a case-by-case  basis,  but  the  MAJCOM/A3  may  not  approve  blanket  or  group  (two  or  more  aircrew) waivers.    Waiver  requests  should  be  submitted  through  MAJCOM  Standardization  and Evaluation channels to the A3.  As applicable, MAJCOM/A3 will forward requests to AF/A3O, with an info copy to AF/A3O-AI. 1.4.1.  Tier requirements refer to  waiver  authority  based on level  of risk.   Refer to  AFI 33-360, Table 1.1, Tier Waiver Authorities. 1.5.  Supplements.  Units are encouraged to supplement this instruction with standard evaluation profiles  that  best  fit  the  unit’s  mission,  equipment,  and  location.    Coordinate  supplements  for approval IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2.  Any unit developed supplements to this AFI is forwarded to  AFSOC/A3V for prepublication approval. 1.6.  Requisition  and  Distribution  Procedures.  Unit  commanders  may  provide  copies  for  all aircrew members and associated support personnel. 1.7.  Improvement  Recommendations.  Recommendations for improvement to  this instruction are through improvements encouraged. Send  comments and suggested 6 AFI11-2C-32BV2  26 OCTOBER 2015 standardization/evaluation  channels,  on  an  AF  Form  847,  Recommendation  for  Change  of Publication, according to AFI 11-215, Flight Manual Procedures, and MAJCOM Supplement. 1.8.  Evaluations.  This  instruction  establishes  standardized  instrument,  qualification,  mission, and  instructor  evaluation  criteria.  It  also  establishes  the  areas/subareas  necessary  for  the successful  completion  of  evaluations,  and  identifies  required  areas/subareas  that  will  be considered critical and/or non-critical.  (T-2) 1.9.  Evaluation  Requirements.  Accomplish  evaluations  concurrently,  whenever  practical. Each  C-32B  crewmember  will  be  evaluated  at  the  frequency  in  AFI  11-202,  Vol  2  and  the appropriate MAJCOM supplement: (T-2) 1.9.1.  Instrument  (INSTM) Evaluation.   All  C-32B pilots  will successfully  complete initial and periodic instrument evaluations including the requisite instrument refresher course (IRC) and  open-book,  written  instrument  examination  according  to  AFMAN  11-210,  Instrument Refresher Course Program, and a flight evaluation. 1.9.2.  Qualification  (QUAL)  Evaluation.    All  C-32B  aircrew  members  will  successfully complete  initial  and  periodic  qualification  evaluations  including  the  requisite  open-book, closed-book, Boldface written examinations, emergency procedures evaluation (EPE), and a flight evaluation. 1.9.3.  Mission  (MSN)  Evaluations.    C-32B  aircrew  members  will  successfully  complete initial and periodic airland mission evaluations.  Mission evaluations should be as realistic as possible with a minimum of simulated events. 1.9.4.  Instructor  (INSTR)  Evaluations.    To  initially  qualify  as  an  instructor  in  the  C-32B, aircrew  members  will  successfully  complete  an  initial  instructor  qualification  course  and evaluation.    Subsequently,  aircrew  members  designated  as  instructors  will  be  evaluated  on their ability to instruct during all periodic evaluations. 1.9.5.  SPOT  Evaluations.    A  SPOT  evaluation  is  an  evaluation  not  intended  to  satisfy  the requirements  of  a  periodic  (i.e.,  INSTM,  QUAL  or  MSN)  evaluation.    SPOT  evaluations have no specific requisites or requirements unless specified in MAJCOM supplements.  See AFI 11202, Vol 2 for options available to convert a SPOT evaluation to meet requirements of a periodic evaluation. 1.9.6.  Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE).  See AFI 11-202, Vol 2 requirements and the  following:  An  EPE  is  a  requisite  for  all  QUAL  and  MSN  evaluations.    EPEs  may  be conducted  verbally,  in-flight,  or  by  another  method  determined  by  the  examiner  or  unit stan/eval.    EPEs  should  be  scenario  driven  and  tailored  to  the  specific  crew  position.    The EPE will include areas commensurate with the examinee’s qualification and experience level.  Flight  examiners  should  include  other  general  knowledge  areas  as  well.    For  MSN evaluations, evaluate mission-specific equipment and situations.  EPEs will include sufficient in-flight  and  ground  emergencies  to  evaluate  the  examinee’s  knowledge  of  systems  and procedures to the flight examiner’s satisfaction. 1.9.6.1.  Examinees  may  use  publications  that  are  normally  available  in-flight.    The examinee must be able to recite all Boldface items from memory and provide the initial steps of selected emergency procedures that would not allow time for reference. AFI11-2C-32BV2  26 OCTOBER 2015 7 1.9.6.2.  Examinees  receiving  an  overall  EPE  grade  of  unqualified  will  be  placed  in supervised status until recommended additional training and re-evaluation are completed.  Examinees  receiving  an  overall  EPE  grade  of  unqualified  because  of  unsatisfactory Boldface  procedures  will  not  be  permitted  to  fly  in  their  aircrew  position  until  a successful  re-evaluation  is  accomplished.  Accomplish  additional  training  according  to requirements in AFI 11-202, Vol 2. 1.9.7.  Evaluation  Prefixes.    Use  AFI  11-202,  Vol  2  evaluation  prefixes  for  AF  Form  8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.  Use “SPOT” for the pilot air refueling evaluation.  Use “QUAL/MSN”  for  the  loadmaster  and  airborne  mission  system  specialist  evaluation.    For combined  pilot  mission  evaluations  annotate  as  “INSTM/QUAL/MSN”.    Use  the  same annotation on the AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. 1.10.  Grading Policies.  (T-2) 1.10.1.  The overall qualification level awarded an evaluation is based on performance during both  the  flight  and  ground  phases.    This  grade  should  be  awarded  only  after  all  evaluation requirements have been completed and given due consideration. 1.10.2.  To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the aircrew member must satisfy the criteria  set  forth  for  that  evaluation  and  demonstrate  ability  to  operate  the  aircraft  and/or equipment safely and effectively during all phases of an evaluation. 1.10.3.  Use  the  grading  criteria  in  this  instruction  to  grade  areas/subareas  accomplished during an evaluation. 1.10.3.1.  The  flight  examiner  must  grade  the  areas/subareas  listed  as  “required”  in  the general and specific evaluation sections of this instruction. 1.10.3.2.  The  flight  examiner  may  grade  any  area/subarea  accomplished  during  an evaluation the  specific  evaluation if  performance accomplished or flight safety. that  area/subarea in impacts 1.10.4.  When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not possible, the area may be verbally evaluated.    Flight  examiners  will  make  every  effort  to  evaluate  all  required  areas  in-flight before  resorting  to  this  provision.   When  used,  the  evaluator  will  identify  the  area  or  items within the area that were verbally evaluated on AF Form 8 as an examiner remark (following the mission description).  See Chapter 3 for specific areas that may be verbally evaluated. 1.10.5.  Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions.   Minor or  momentary  deviations  are  acceptable,  provided  the  examinee  applies  prompt  corrective action  and  such  deviations  do  not  jeopardize  flight  safety.    Consider  cumulative  deviations when determining the overall grade. 1.10.5.1.  For pilots  only, if the flight  manual  recommends a specific airspeed range for performance  of  a  maneuver,  the  flight  examiner  will  apply  the  grading  criteria  to  the upper and lower limits of that range. 1.10.5.2.  Flight  examiners  will  use  sound  judgment  in  the  application  of  the  grading criteria in this instruction to determine the final grade. 8 AFI11-2C-32BV2  26 OCTOBER 2015 1.11.  Grading  System.  (T-1)                      Note:  This  paragraph for reference only  and duplicates information in AFI 11-202, Vol 2, allowing the evaluator a single-source instruction to conduct an evaluation.  When a conflict occurs, use AFI 11-202, Vol 2.  1.11.1.  Overall Qualification Levels. 1.11.1.1.  Qualification  Level  1  (Q-1).    The  aircrew  member  demonstrated  desired performance  and  knowledge  of  procedures,  equipment,  and  directives  within  tolerances specified  in  this  instruction.    Qualification  Level  1  will  be  awarded  when  no discrepancies were noted and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if: 1.11.1.1.1.  The  discrepancies  resulted  in  no  more  than  a  “Q-”  grade  being  given  in any area(s)/subarea(s). 1.11.1.1.2.  In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude awarding of an overall Qualification Level 1. 1.11.1.1.3.  All  discrepancies  noted  during  the  evaluation  were  cleared  during  the evaluation debrief. 1.11.1.2.  Qualification  Level  2 (Q-2).  The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to perform duties safely, but: 1.11.1.2.1.  There were one (or more) area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was assigned. 1.11.1.2.2.  A non-critical area/subarea grade of “U” was awarded. 1.11.1.2.3.  In  the  judgment  of  the  flight  examiner,  there  is  justification  based  on performance in one or more areas/subareas. 1.11.1.3.  Qualification  Level  3  (Q-3). unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge.   The  aircrew  member  demonstrated  an 1.11.1.3.1.  A grade of “U” awarded in a critical subarea/area requires an overall “Q-3” for the evaluation. 1.11.1.3.2.  An  overall  “Q-3”  can  be  awarded  if,  in  the  judgment  of  the  flight examiner, there is justification based on performance in one or more areas/subareas. 1.11.1.4.  The  flight  examiner  will  indicate  all  appropriate  restriction(s)  and  additional training on the AF Form 8. 1.11.2.  Area/Subarea  Grades.    Areas/Subareas  will  have  a  two-level  (Q/U)  or  three-level (Q/Q-/U)  grading  system.    The  overall  area  grade  will  be  the  lowest  of  any  subarea  grade awarded. 1.11.2.1.  A  “Q”  is  the  desired  level  of  performance.    The  examinee  demonstrated  a satisfactory  knowledge  of  all  required  information,  performed  aircrew  duties  within  the prescribed tolerances and accomplished the assigned mission. 1.11.2.2.  A “Q-” indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area tasks, but  requires  debriefing  or  additional  training  as  determined  by  the  flight  examiner.  Deviations from established standards must not exceed the prescribed “Q-” tolerances or jeopardize flight safety. AFI11-2C-32BV2  26 OCTOBER 2015 9 1.11.2.3.  Assign  a  “U”  area  grade  for  any  breach  of  flight  discipline,  performance outside  allowable  parameters  or  deviations  from  prescribed  procedures/  tolerances  that adversely affected mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety.  An examinee receiving  an  area  grade  of  “U”  normally  requires  additional  training.    When,  in  the judgment  of  the  flight  examiner,  additional  training  will  not  constructively  improve examinee’s  performance,  it  is  not  required.    In  this  case,  the  flight  examiner  must thoroughly debrief the examinee. 1.11.3.  Boldface.  Grade Boldface either “Q” or “U.” 1.11.4.  Critical  Areas.    Critical  areas  require  adequate  accomplishment  by  the  aircrew member  in  order  to  successfully  achieve  the  mission  objectives.    If  an  aircrew  member receives  an  unqualified  grade  in  any  critical  area,  the  overall  grade  for  the  evaluation  will also be unqualified.  Critical areas are identified by “(Critical)” in the area title and shading of Q- block on the AF Form 3862, Aircrew Evaluation Worksheet. 1.12.  Unsatisfactory Performance.  (T-1)               Note: This paragraph for reference only and duplicates information in AFI 11-202, Vol 2, allowing the evaluator a single-source instruction to conduct the evaluation.  When a conflict occurs, use AFI 11-202, Vol 2. 1.12.1.  Conduct  a  thorough  pre-mission  briefing  and  post-mission  debriefing  to  the examinee and applicable aircrew members on all aspects of the evaluation. 1.12.2.  Immediately correct breaches of flying safety or flight discipline.  When an examinee jeopardizes  safety  of  flight,  the  evaluator  may  assume  the  duties  of  that  aircrew  member (provided  the  examiner’s  flight  duty  period  (FDP)  does  not  exceed  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3, General  Flight  Rules  maximum  FDP  for  a  basic  crew).    This  does  not  mean  the  flight examiner  must  assume  the  examinee’s  position  any  time  unsatisfactory  performance  is observed.    If  the  examiner  feels  the  examinee  can  continue  safely  with  supervision  the examiner is not required to assume the examinee’s duties. 1.12.3.  Assign  a  qualification  level  of  “Q-3”  for  unsatisfactory  performance  in  any  critical area/sub-area or if the flight examiner assumes the examinee’s duties. 1.12.4.  Immediately  notify  the  examinee’s  squadron  commander/operations  officer  and flight commander, if available, when less than Q-1 performance is observed. 1.12.5.  Unsatisfactory  performance  in  a  non-critical  area/subarea  will  result  in  no  higher than a qualification level “Q-2.” examiners  must from 1.12.6.  Flight established procedures/directives  in  any  area,  regardless  of  the  individual’s  crew  specialty,  to  the squadron/group  commander,  along  with  the  evaluator’s  recommendation  for  corrective action, IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2 and the MAJCOM supplement. report  deviations/discrepancies 1.13.  Conduct of Evaluations. 1.13.1.  Before the Aircraft Commander (AC) Briefing, the evaluator will inform the AC of any special requirements.  Flight examiners will brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose, and  requirements  of  the  evaluation,  as  well  as  all  applicable  evaluation  criteria,  prior  to flight.    Any  unique  evaluator  inputs  to  the  planned  profile  should  be  communicated  to  the examinee  no  later  than  24  hours  prior  to  scheduled  mission  brief.    The  examinee  will accomplish  all  required  mission  planning.    If  an  Operations  Planning  Team  or  Deployment 10 AFI11-2C-32BV2  26 OCTOBER 2015 Planning  Team  accomplishes  mission  planning,  the  examinee  is  ultimately  responsible  for the accuracy and completeness of all mission planning paperwork.  Units will provide flight examiners  with  a  copy  of  necessary  charts,  flight  logs,  mission  folders,  and  any  additional items they deem necessary.  Flight examiners will then evaluate the examinee in each graded area/subarea.  (T-2) 1.13.2.  Flight  examiners  will  ensure  all  required  training  and  documentation  is  complete prior to initial or requalification evaluations.  (T-2) 1.13.2.1.  Flight  examiners  will  normally  not  evaluate  personnel  they  have  primarily trained or recommended for an upgrade evaluation. 1.13.2.2.  Unless  requested  by  examinee  and  approved  by  squadron  supervision,  the examinee will be current for all events evaluated during a periodic evaluation. 1.13.2.3.  Flight  examiners  will  not  intentionally  fail  any  equipment  during  flight evaluations, but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight.  (T-2) 1.13.3.  Unless otherwise specified, flight examiners may conduct the evaluation in any crew position/  seat  which  will  best  enable  the  flight  examiner  to  observe  the  examinee’s performance. 1.13.3.1.  To  ensure  the  most  comprehensive  evaluation,  the  flight  examiner  should  not occupy a primary crew position.  If conditions warrant, the flight examiner may occupy a primary crew position during an evaluation with unit commander approval. 1.13.4.  Note  discrepancies  and  deviations  from  prescribed  tolerances  and  performance criteria  during  the  evaluation.    Compare  the  examinee’s  performance  with  the  tolerances provided in the grading criteria and assign an appropriate grade for each area/subarea. 1.13.4.1.  The judgment of the flight examiner, guidance provided in AFI 11-202, Vol 2, and  this  instruction  will  be  the  determining  factors  in  assigning  an  overall  grade.    The flight examiner will thoroughly critique all aspects of the flight.  During the critique, the flight  examiner  will  review  the  examinee’s  overall  rating,  specific  deviations, area/subarea grades assigned, and any additional training required.  (T-2) 1.13.4.2.  An evaluation will not be changed to a training mission to avoid documenting substandard performance, nor will a training mission be changed to an evaluation.  (T-3) training  requirements. 1.13.4.3.  In the event  of unsatisfactory performance, the flight  examiner  will determine additional training  should  not  be accomplished  on  the  same  flight.    Exception:  Additional  training  on  the  same  flight  is allowed  when  unique  situations  presenting  valuable  training  opportunities  (i.e., thunderstorm  avoidance,  crosswind  landings)  exist.    This  option  requires  utmost  flight examiner  discretion  and  judicious  application.    When  used,  the  examinee  must  be informed of when the additional training begins and ends.  (T-2)   Normally,  additional 1.13.5.  When evaluations are less than Q-1 performance, immediately notify the examinee’s squadron commander/operations officer according to AFI 11-202, Vol 2.  (T-2) 1.13.6.  Rechecks will normally be administered by a flight examiner other than the one who administered the original evaluation. AFI11-2C-32BV2  26 OCTOBER 2015 11 1.14.  Use  of  AF  Form  3862,  Aircrew  Evaluation  Worksheet.  Units  (normally  OGV)  will normally print AF Form 3862 from PEX to use as an evaluation worksheet.  Copy each title, area number,  and  text,  and  shading  to  the  appropriate  blocks.    Units  may  add  special  interest  items and/or local evaluation requirements.  In-flight, use the worksheet to ensure all required areas are evaluated.    Record  both  positive  and  negative  trend  information  and  aircrew  member’s performance.  File the worksheet or draft copy of the AF Form 8 in the aircrew member’s Flight Evaluation  Folder  (FEF)  immediately  after  the  flight  evaluation  as  a  temporary  record  of  the evaluation results.  Maintain until the finished AF Form 8 is added to the FEF, and then discard.  (T-2) 1.15.  Aircrew Examinations.  See examination requirements in AFI 11-202, Vol 2 and include the following: 1.15.1.  Initial,  Requalification  and  recurring  evaluations:  Complete  an  Open  Book,  Closed Book,  Instrument  (pilots  only)  and  Boldface/CAPS,  administered  by  unit  stan/eval.  Document  examinations  on  the  AF  Form  8  as  Open  Book,  Closed  Book,  Instrument, Boldface/CAPS, Date completed, and the appropriate score.  Open book questions should be treated as a Secure Question Bank (SQB) using the guidance in AFI 11-202, Vol 2 and the MAJCOM supplement. 1.15.2.  Closed Book Exam.  A closed book exam is a requisite for the periodic qualification (QUAL)  evaluation.    Closed  book  questions  will  come  from  MDS-specific  and  local procedure  MQFs.    These  questions  will  emphasize  information  and  system  knowledge necessary for safe flight and mission accomplishment.  The basic exam will consist of 20 to 30  questions.    Additional  questions  commensurate  with  the  crewmember’s  level  of qualification  (instructor/evaluator)  and/or  special  mission  qualifications  (air  refueling)  may be  included  in  the  closed  book  exam.    Complete  a  Boldface  exam  in  conjunction  with  the closed  book  exam.    See  crew  member  chapters  for  additional  testing  requirements.    C-32B MQFs  will  be  developed  locally  and  sent  to  MAJCOM  stan/eval  annually  IAW  the  unit supplement.  (T-2) 1.15.3.  Instrument Exam.  The instrument written exam will be accomplished during the 6-month INSTM/QUAL eligibility period.  The C-32B Instrument Exam will be developed by unit DOV IAW AFMAN 11-210.  Document completed exam on AF Form 8 as Instrument, date completed, and the appropriate score.  (T-2) 1.16.  Typical  C-32B  Evaluation  Profile(s).

Senior Officer Requirements.  See AFI 11-202, Vol 1, Aircrew Training, and Chapter 2. 12 AFI11-2C-32BV2  26 OCTOBER 2015 Chapter 2 ALL EVALUATIONS 2.1.  General.  The general grading criteria contained in this chapter applies to all crew positions and all evaluations.  The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform required duties safely and effectively.  This includes appropriate aircraft systems operation IAW AFI 11-2C-32B,  Vol  3,  Flight  Crew  Operations  Manual  (FCOM),  Vol  1&2,  Flight  Crew  Training Manual  (FCTM),  Boeing  757  Quick  Reference  Handbook  (QRH),  Minimum  Equipment  List (MEL), and Aircraft User’s Manual.  (T-2) 2.2.  Requirements.  Evaluate all crew members on areas listed in Table 2.1.  (T-2) 2.2.1.  Examinations.  All crew members will complete open and closed book examinations as a requisite to periodic evaluations IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2 and applicable supplements. 2.2.2.  EPE.  An  EPE  is  a  requisite  for  all  QUAL  and  MSN  evaluations  (does  not  include special  MSN  evaluations.    However,  emergency  procedures  will  be  covered  during  special MSN evaluations).  EPEs may be conducted verbally, in-flight, in a simulator, or by another method determined by the examiner or unit stan/eval.   EPEs should be scenario driven and tailored  to  the  specific  crew  position.    The  EPE  will  include  areas  commensurate  with  the examinee’s qualification and experience level.  Flight examiners should include other general knowledge  areas  as  well.    For  MSN  evaluations,  evaluate  mission-specific  equipment  and situations.    EPEs  will  include  sufficient  in-flight  and  ground  emergencies  to  evaluate  the examinee’s knowledge of systems and procedures to the flight examiner’s satisfaction. 2.2.2.1.  Examinees  may  use  publications  that  are  normally  available  in  flight.    The examinee  must  recite  all  Boldface  items  from  memory  and  should  provide  the  initial steps  of  emergency  procedures  that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  flight  examiner,  would  not allow time for reference. 2.2.2.2.  Grading criteria for EPEs are outlined in Area 5 of General Grading Areas. 2.2.3.  Publications  Check.  Required  for  all  QUAL  or  combined  QUAL/MSN  evaluations as outlined in Area 12 of General Grading Areas. 2.2.3.1.  Electronic  publications  on  MAJCOM  issued  electronic  devices  are  authorized.  Compliance  with  MAJCOM  policies  on  electronic  devices  is  mandatory.    If  personal paper publications are utilized and/or maintained they may be evaluated. 2.2.4.  CRM.  IAW  AFI  11-290,  Cockpit/Crew  Resource  Management  Training  Program, CRM skills will be evaluated during initial and periodic evaluations.  CRM skills are integral to  all  phases  of  flight;  therefore,  no  specific  area  titled  CRM  exists.    CRM  skills  are imbedded  within  specific  grading  criteria  (mission  planning,  airmanship/situational awareness,  crew  coordination,  communication,  risk  management/decision  making,  task management,  and  briefing/debriefing)  and  include  all  of  the  skills  listed  on  the  AF  Form 4031, CRM Skills Criteria Training/Evaluation Form.  Therefore, use of the AF Form 4031 is unnecessary for evaluations. AFI11-2C-32BV2  26 OCTOBER 2015 13 2.2.5.  Initial Qualification Evaluations.  All required areas must be evaluated for the type of  evaluation  flown,  IAW  guidance  in  this  volume.

First  pilots  will  be evaluated  to  the  same  area  standards  as  pilots  unless  specified  otherwise.    First  pilot  crew coordination  will  not  include  duties  and  responsibilities  expected  of  an  aircraft  commander.  Instructors will demonstrate instructor duties on all periodic evaluations.  (T-2) 4.1.1.  Pilots should make every effort to fly evaluations in the mission aircraft. 4.1.2.  To  promote  the  efficient  use  of  flying  resources,  the  recurring  INSTM,  QUAL  and MSN flight evaluations may be combined. 4.2.  Requirements.  Evaluate all general  areas  outlined in  Table  2.1 on all evaluations.  Also, evaluate all instructors on areas in Table 3.1 on all evaluations.  (T-2) 4.3.  INSTM  Evaluations.  See  Table  4.1  for  required  INSTM  evaluation  areas.    Requisite (prerequisite for initial/requalification evaluations) is  the  Instrument examination.  The  INSTM evaluation will be conducted in-flight or in a simulator approved by AFSOC/A3V.  (T-2) 4.3.1.  The evaluation  profile will include:  two precision approaches (at  least  one simulated Category  II  ILS  is  required:  for  initial  instrument  qualification,  the  examinee  will  perform pilot not flying (PNF) duties; periodic and requalification examinees may perform PF or PNF duties), two non-precision approaches (at least one RNAV or RNAV/GPS approach and one VNAV  descent  profile  is  required),  holding  or  procedure  turn,  circling  maneuver,  missed approach, and simulated engine-out instrument approach.   4.4.  QUAL  Evaluations.  See  Table  4.1  for  required  QUAL  evaluation  areas.    Requisites (prerequisites  for  initial/requalification  evaluations)  include  QUAL  Open  and  Closed  Book examinations,  EPE,  and  Boldface  examination.  This  evaluation  is  normally  accomplished  in combination with an INSTM evaluation.  The QUAL evaluation will be conducted in-flight or in in a simulator approved by AFSOC/A3V.  (T-2) 4.4.1.  The evaluation profile will include: Visual Flight Rules (VFR) pattern, touch-and-go procedures (IP/EP only), simulated engine-out go-around, and simulated engine-out landing. 4.4.2.  Initial/Requalification.  All  initial  and  requalification  first  pilot  and  instructor  pilot QUAL evaluations will include at least one landing from the right seat.   4.4.3.  Periodic.  Evaluations  should  be  conducted  in  the  mission  aircraft.    If  the  mission aircraft  is  unavailable,  the  unit  commander  may  approve  evaluations  in  a  like  type  (B757) aircraft  or  AFSOC/A3V  may  approve  evaluations  in  a  certified  simulator.    If  a  periodic evaluation  is  administered  in  a  simulator,  every  effort  shall  be  made  to  ensure  the  next periodic evaluation is accomplished in the mission aircraft.  (T-2) 4.4.3.1.  Seat  Position.  For  all  periodic  evaluations,  evaluate  appropriate  areas  from either the left or right seat.   4.5.  MSN Evaluations.  Unit airland mission objectives are accomplished in the INSTM/QUAL profiles.    Therefore,  accomplishment  of  the  INSTM/QUAL  evaluation  profile  satisfies  the AFI 11-202, Vol 2 periodic MSN evaluation requirement.  (T-2)  AFI11-2C-32BV2  26 OCTOBER 2015 25 4.6.  Aircraft  Commander  (AC)  Evaluations.  The AC evaluation  is  a one-time event.   Upon completion  of  AC  upgrade  training  and  an  instructor  pilot  recommendation,  the  AC  candidate will receive a one-time “SPOT” evaluation prior to  AC Certification.  This “SPOT” evaluation has no prerequisites and will serve as an operational mission evaluation (OME) in which the AC candidate will command a typical unit mission.  (T-2) 4.7.  Air  to  Air  Refueling  (AAR)  Evaluations.  See  Table  4.2  for  AAR  evaluation  areas  and subparagraph  below  for  requirements.    There  are  no  requisites  or  prerequisites  for  the  AAR evaluation.  (T-2) 4.7.1.  Initial.  The AAR evaluation is a one-time event, provided qualification is maintained.  The  evaluation  profile  will  include  a  rendezvous,  closure  to  pre-contact,  contact  and breakaway.  Except for breakaway, evaluate emergency procedures verbally.  Document the AAR evaluation as “SPOT” on the flight phase block of the AF Form 8.  The examiner will make the appropriate comments pertaining to the AAR evaluation in the Mission Description section of the AF Form 8. 4.7.1.1.  This evaluation can only be flown in the mission aircraft. 4.7.2.  Requalification.  Pilots  requiring  requalification  in  AAR  will  use  the  initial  profile described above in paragraph 4.7.1.  Refer to AFI 11-2C-32B, Vol 1 for aircraft recurrency and requalification requirements.   4.8.  Special Qualification.  Reserved for future use. Table 4.1.

Using all available cues, accomplished closure from pre-contact to contact in a stabilized manor at a rate of approximately 1 foot per second to arrive in the contact position.  Examinee demonstrated the ability to accomplish a sustained fuel transfer of at least  5  minutes  with  the tanker  autopilot  on.   In  the  event  of  an  inadvertent  disconnect, the 5 minute time constraint will start over.  There should be no more than 2 inadvertent disconnects  while  attempting  to  achieve  the  5  minute  contact  requirement.    Examinee demonstrated the ability to accomplish a sustained contact with the tanker autopilot off.  A  sustained  contact  of  approximately  5  minutes  is  sufficient  time  to  sample  this maneuver. 4.9.23.2.  Q-.    Examinee  demonstrated  closure  from  pre-contact  to  contact  with  minor difficulty, but made timely corrections to speed and rate of closure.  Examinee exhibited minor erratic maneuvering while attempting to maintain a stabilized contact position with the  tanker  autopilot  on  or  off  but  was  able  to  sustain  a  contact  for  the  prescribed  time without exceeding 2 inadvertent disconnects. 4.9.23.3.  U.    Closure  from  pre-contact  to  contact  resulted  in  a  potentially  unsafe condition  which  required  IP/EP  intervention  (i.e.    an  overrun  condition  in  which  the examinee  either  fails  to  recognize  or  respond).    Examinee  demonstrated  an  inability  to AFI11-2C-32BV2  26 OCTOBER 2015 37 affect a contact and remain in a stabilized position for at least 5 minutes with the tanker autopilot either on or off.   4.9.24.  Area 63.  Breakaway. 4.9.24.1.  Q.  Examinee demonstrated prompt and deliberate breakaway procedures IAW Aircraft User’s Manual and AFI 11-2C-32B, Vol 3.  4.9.24.2.  Q-.  Examinee was slow to respond to either tanker verbal or visual signal for a breakaway.  Displayed minor deficiencies from procedure (i.e. not pressing the autopilot disconnect switch, not bringing throttles to full idle, not establishing a steady descent rate sufficient to separate from the tanker, etc.).   4.9.24.3.  U.    Incorrectly  applied  or  failed  to  apply  the  breakaway  procedure  IAW Aircraft  User’s  Manual  and  AFI  11-2C-32B,  Vol  3.    Incorrect  application  or  overly abrupt  control  inputs  caused  a  potentially  unsafe  condition  during  the  breakaway maneuver. 4.9.25.  Area 64.  Emergency Procedures. 4.9.25.1.  Q.  Examinee displayed a thorough knowledge of AAR emergency procedures to  include  in-flight  indications,  causes  and  corrective  actions.    AAR  emergency procedures  include  but  are  not  limited  to:  failure  to  disconnect;  emergency  boom latching; tanker/receiver abort; pressure refueling; etc. 4.9.25.2.  Q-.    Examinee  displayed  adequate  knowledge  or  AAR  emergency  procedures with  minor  deviations.    Examinee  was  able  to  identify  and  draw  logical  conclusions  to AAR  emergency  procedures  with  minor  difficulty.    Actions  taken  would  not  adversely impact the safety of the operation of the integrity of the air refueling system. 4.9.25.3.  U.  Examinee was unable to identify the malfunction or take corrective actions to  correct  an  AAR  emergency  condition.    Conclusions  drawn  would  lead  to  potential system damage, mission failure, or jeopardize the safety of the aircraft and crew. 4.9.26.  Areas 65-69.
