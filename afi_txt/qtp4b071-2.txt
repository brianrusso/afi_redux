What is the aim of a routine assessment?  A:  Routine assessments are designed to be short-duration, and identify/prioritize the need for a more in-depth (special) assessment. The information collected during a routine assessment is used to focus limited resources in a prioritized manner   (Source: AFI 48-145, Occupational and Environmental Health Program)   2.

Gather/Review risk assessment factors identified during the routine assessment.1 2. Determine the Exposure Assessment Priority.2 3. Document the prioritization score in OEHMIS (DOEHRS or equivalent).3  LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:  NOTES:  1.  Pay attention to confidence in hazard characterization, confidence in controls, exposure rating, and health hazard rating factors for each project.  2.  Using the EAP model in 48-146 para 2.4, plug in all the ratings gathered from step 2 above.   3.  The EAP can also be calculated in DOEHRS and then the trainee should determine where the special assessment should fall in the overall BEF assessment schedule.       7 AFQTP 4B071-2                                                                      Craftsman Training Guide:  OEH Process Assessment  TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS      STS Line Item 4.2.3:  Prioritize special assessments 1.  How are OEH special assessments prioritized?    2.  Your Airman is out doing a vent survey at the Blast/Paint shop.  The ventilation system has not met criteria for the third quarter in a row.  What is the next plan of action for this system?         4.   What is the uncertainty rating for a hazard where the confidence characterization is “Low” and confidence in controls is “Medium”?            8 AFQTP 4B071-2                                                                      Craftsman Training Guide:  OEH Process Assessment   5.  The Aircraft Corrosion Control shop at Regnault AFB has reported that airmen there are exhibiting symptoms of intoxication and have requested a special assessment. When you arrive to determine a possible source, you observe five airmen cleaning aircraft parts with a solvent. The five airman who are actively cleaning while you are observing are wearing rubber gloves, goggles (which you recognize as splash proof), and water resistant boots. You obtain a 15-minute breathing zone air sample from each of them and determine that one of them is inhaling 1050 ppm of trichloroethylene which is still a component of the solvent used at this shop, while the others’ results show only 960 ppm of the same chemical. What is the EAP for this cleaning process?                              9 AFQTP 4B071-2                                                                      Craftsman Training Guide:  OEH Process Assessment   PERFORMANCE CHECKLIST     STS Line Item 4.2.3:  Prioritize special assessments Proficiency Code: 3c Can do all parts of the task.

The ventilation system has not met criteria for the third quarter in a row.  What is the next plan of action for this system?    A:  In situations where a special assessment has identified a health hazard that requires action by a non-BE entity, a Risk Assessment Code (RAC) should be assigned.
