SECTION A - GENERAL INFORMATION 1.  Purpose:  This CFETP provides the information necessary for Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program.  This plan outlines the training that individuals in AFSC 2A6X1H should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This CFETP identifies initial skill, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  This training is conducted by AETC at Sheppard AFB, TX.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, 9-skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes, some are:  1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.  Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual’s career.  1.2.  Identifies tasks and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual's career.  1.3.  Lists training courses that are available in the specialty and identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method.  1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints which impact full implementation of the desired career field training process.  2.  Use of the CFETP:  This plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.    2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, non-resident, Training Detachment (TD), and exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining the resources needed to provide the identified training.                                                                                                                      4 CFETP 2A6X1H, 1 October 2015 2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements.  OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses can satisfy these identified requirements.  MAJCOM developed training, to support this AFSC, must be identified for inclusion in this plan, and must not duplicate other available training resources.  2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.  3.

Narrative explanations of each resource constraint and an impact statement describing what effect each constraint has on training are included.  Also included in this section are actions required, office of primary responsibility, and target completion dates.  Resource constraints will be, as a minimum, reviewed and updated annually.  12.  Apprentice Level Training:  No resource constraints identified.  13.  Journeyman Level Training:  No resource constraints identified.  14.  Craftsman Level Training:  No resource constraints identified.                                                                                                                     13 CFETP 2A6X1H, 1 October 2015 PART II  Section A - Course Objective List  1.  Measurement:  Each proficiency coded STS task or knowledge item taught at the technical school is measured through the use of an objective.  An objective is a written instruction for the student so he or she knows what is expected of them to successfully complete training on each task.  Each objective is comprised of a condition, behavior, and standard which states what is expected of the student for each task.  The condition is the setting in which the training takes place (i.e. TOs, type of equipment, etc.).  The behavior is the observable portion of the objective (i.e. perform an operational check).  The standard is the level of performance that is measured to ensure the STS proficiency code level is attained.  Each objective uses letter codes(s) to identify how it is measured.  All objectives using the PC code indicate a progress check is used to measure subject or task knowledge.  “W” indicates a comprehensive written test and is used to measure the subject or task knowledge at the end of a block of instruction.  “PC/W” indicates a subject or task knowledge progress check and a separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test.  2.  Standard:  The standard for written examinations is 70%.  Standards for performance objectives are indicated in the objective and are also indicated on the individual progress check checklist.  The checklist is used by the instructor to document each student’s progress on each task.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.  Students must satisfactorily complete all PCs prior to taking the written test.  3.  Proficiency Level:  Review column 4A of the STS to determine the proficiency level of a particular task or knowledge item.  Review the course objective list to determine which STS item the objective supports.  Review the proficiency code key in Part II, Section E of this CFETP for an explanation of the proficiency codes.  Most task performance is taught to the ‘2b’ proficiency level which means the students can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step by step procedures for doing the task.  For tasks that are taught to the ‘3c’ proficiency level, students can do all parts of the task and only require a spot check on completed work (competent).  The student can also identify why and when a task must be done and why each step is needed.  4.

Implementation:  This STS will be used for technical training provided by Air Education and Training Command for the following classes:  Course J3ABR2A631H048C is planned to begin on 2 December 2015 with a graduation date of 29 March 2016.  15.  Purpose: As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:  15.1.  Lists in column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.  An asterisk (*) before the number indicates a wartime course objective.  15.2.  An asterisk (*) in column 2 identifies  specialty-wide training requirements core tasks.   Tasks marked with */R are deferrable for ANG /AFRC until training capability becomes available; MAJCOM Functional Managers, commanders, and supervisors may designate additional tasks as necessary.  Third-party certification of core tasks is no longer an Air Force requirement for this specialty.  However, MAJCOMs, commanders, and workcenter supervisors still retain the option to designate critical tasks requiring third-party certification.  To designate a task as requiring third-party certification, identify the appropriate task in the core task column on the specialty training standard (STS) portion of the CFETP in the master task list (MTL) and individual training records.  If the task is not already designated as a core task, identify the task in the core task column.                                                                                                                       17 CFETP 2A6X1H, 1 October 2015  15.2.1.  Core tasks which are not applicable to base assigned aircraft or equipment are not required for upgrade (units are not required to send personnel TDY for core task training).  15.2.2.  For units with more than one mission design (e.g. A-10) aircraft, upgrade trainees need only complete core tasks on a single mission design/TMSM.  MFMs, unit commanders, and/or supervisors may require trainees to complete core task training on additional mission design aircraft, if desired.  If some of these core tasks involve training in another unit on base, trainees must still complete all core tasks relevant to at least one mission design aircraft.  Flightline-assigned personnel must complete backshop core tasks and vice versa.  All units are bound by the requirements in this CFETP and will accommodate core task trainees from other units.  15.2.3.  Units will complete the Computer Based Training (CBT) core tasks applicable to the system in use and are not required to complete both.  Locations with both IMDS and G081 will only train on the system applicable to their MDS/TMSM.  This training is available by access from the Air Force Portal.  15.3.  Provides certification for OJT.  Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Use IMDS/G081 to document technician qualifications, if available.  Task certification must show a certification or completed date.  15.4.  Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements.  Column 4 shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as result of training on the task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.   15.5.  Qualitative Requirements:  Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.   15.6.  Job Qualification Standard:  Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form 623, On-The-Job Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201.  For OJT, the tasks in column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. "Go" means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct procedures.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:  15.6.1.  Documentation:  Document and certify completion of training IAW AFI 36-2201.  Automated records, utilizing MIS or IMDS/G081 reflecting this STS is highly encouraged.  Use of Part II and attachments one and two of this CFETP are mandatory in individual training records.  Use of Part I of this CFETP is optional.  Use of at least one of attachments 3 through 7 is required.    15.6.2  Transcribing from Old CFETP to New CFETP:  All AFJQSs and previous CFETPs are replaced by this CFETP; therefore, transcribing of all training records to this CFETP STS is mandatory.  Use this CFETP STS (or automated STS) to identify and certify all past and current qualifications.  Document and certify all previous and current training IAW AFI 36-2201.  15.7.

(Evaluation) Scale Value 1 2 3 4 a b c d A B C D Explanations * A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.  (Example:  b and 1b)  ** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks.  -  This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.  X  This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.    NOTE:  All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during war time. Tasks marked with */R are deferrable for ANG /AFRC until training capability comes available     Qualitative requirements are used to show the level of training received in formal (AETC) courses.
