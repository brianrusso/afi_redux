Any royalties or other payments received by the Air Force from licensing or assigning an inven-tion under agreements entered into by Air Force laboratories and/or technical activities under 15U.S.C. § 3710a or from licensing an invention under 35 U.S.C. § 207, or under any other provision oflaw, shall be forwarded to SAF/GCQ as a central point of contact. SAF/GCQ will forward the royaltyor other payment to the appropriate Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office withinstructions as to how to disburse the royalties or other payments. 5.2. The inventor or each co-inventor shall be paid each year the first $2,000 plus equal shares of atleast 20 percent of the remainder of the royalties or other payments pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §3710c, asimplemented by DoDI 5535.8, paragraph 6.9. In the absence of extrinsic evidence that co-inventorsmade unequal contributions to the invention, subject to review and approval by SAF/GCQ, it shall bepresumed that the co-inventors made equal contributions to the invention and are entitled to equalshares of the 20 percent of the royalties or other payments. If the royalties or other payments receivedin any given year are less than or equal to $2,000, or in the case of co-inventors, less than or equal to$2,000 times the number of inventors, the entire amount is paid to the inventor, or in the case ofco-inventors, the entire amount is divided equally among the co-inventors. 5.3. The inventor or co-inventors shall receive their prescribed share of any royalties or other pay-ments as received by the Air Force on an annualized basis. Royalties or other payments from inven-tions to any one person shall not exceed $150,000 per year without Presidential approval as providedin 5 U.S.C. § 4504. Any inventor whose whereabouts cannot be established within one year frommailing of the first correspondence concerning a royalty payment for any given year to his or her lastAFI61-301   30 MAY 20017known address shall be presumed to be unknown. Any payments as set forth above and any excessroyalties not disbursed will be disbursed to and retained by the laboratory and/or technical activityresponsible for the licensed (or assigned) invention, until the inventor can be found or until the periodreferenced in  5.5.2.  At which time, such royalties will be paid to the Treasury. 5.4. Any Air Force laboratory and/or technical activity may provide appropriate incentives from roy-alties or other payments to Air Force employees who are not inventors or co-inventors of inventionsbut who substantially increase the technical value of such inventions. When the incentive is in theform of a monetary payment, such payments may be at any level subject to the approval of the AirForce component or laboratory providing the incentive, but such payments shall not exceed the limitsestablished above. Payments may be on a one-time or annual basis, and they shall cease when theemployee is no longer employed by the Air Force. 5.5. The balance of the royalties or other payments will go to the activity where the inventionoccurred, and the funds so transferred to any such activity must be used or obligated by the end of thesecond fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year in which the royalties and other payments were received.The balance of the royalties or other payments may be used for: -- Payment of expenses for administration and licensing inventions and other intellectual property; -- Other activities of the Air Force that increase the licensing potential for transfer of Departmentof Defense technology; -- Scientific research and development within the research and development mission and objec-tives of the activity; -- Rewarding scientific, engineering, and technical employees; -- Promotion of scientific exchange among other Air Force and Department of Defense activities;and/or -- Education and training of employees consistent with the research and development mission andobjectives of the Department of Defense. 5.5.1. The commander or director of the laboratory and/or technical activity may use a portion ofthe royalties to reward Federal employees who develop valuable inventions that cannot be com-mercialized for national security reasons or because they are useful only within DoD’s mission.The commander or director may present these awards annually or more often. Written justificationmust support the award, such as: 5.5.1.1. A patent, a notice of allowability under the Patent Secrecy Act, or a Statutory Inven-tion Registration. 5.5.1.2. A description of the invention's economic benefits to the Air Force or DOD or anassessment of its market potential. 5.5.2. Any royalties not obligated and expended by the end of the second fiscal year succeedingthe fiscal year in which they are received go to the Treasury of the United States. If, after payinginventors, royalties received in a fiscal year exceed 5 percent of the Air Force activity’s combinedbudgets for that year, 75 percent of the excess goes to the Treasury of the United States. The AirForce may spend the other 25 percent for, or obligate it for, the purposes described in paragraph5.5.  during that or the next fiscal year. 8AFI61-301   30 MAY 20015.5.3. Any payment a Federal employee receives under this instruction is in addition to theemployee’s regular pay or any other awards the employee receives. 5.5.4. The payment does not affect the employee’s entitlement to regular pay, annuity, or awardsto which he or she is otherwise entitled or eligible, or limit any such amount of pay, annuity, oraward. 5.5.5. Any payments an inventor periodically receives (royalties, for example) shall continueafter the inventor leaves the activity or agency or after the inventor is deceased. Any such pay-ments after the inventor is deceased shall be made to the inventor’s estate. 6. Certain Assignments. If a contractor, grantee, or participant in an agreement or other arrangementwith an Air Force activity assigns to the United States rights to an invention that generates royalty or otherincome, then the Air Force activity may distribute the royalties per paragraph 5. If an Air Force employeenot working for a laboratory and/or technical activity assigns to the United States rights to an invention,the Air Force activity where the invention occurred and the inventor shall receive any royalties in accor-dance with paragraph 5. 7. Reports. Air Force activities provide data in accordance with the Air Force Technology TransferHandbook to the Technology Transfer Program Management Team on the progress of technology transfer.The Air Force uses this information to report to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Department ofCommerce, and the Government Accounting Office and others as necessary. 8. Other Awards. Air Force activities use existing authority, including AFI 38-401 and 15 U.S.C. §3710b, to award cash to Federal employees for: 8.1. Inventions, innovations, or other outstanding scientific or technological contributions of value tothe United States. ("Value" depends on the likelihood of commercial application or contribution to theAir Force's or Federal Government's mission.) 8.2. Exemplary activities promoting the transfer of science and technology developed within the Fed-eral Government and used by American industry or business, universities, state or local governments,or other non-Federal parties including those activities recognized by FLC awards and the Ronald W.Yates Award for Technology Transfer and other similar awards. 9. Donations and Loans of Research/Defense Laboratory Equipment. Air Force Laboratories and/ortechnical activities may directly donate or loan laboratory equipment to public and private schools andnonprofit institutions pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §3710(i) or 10 U.S.C. §2194 or provide personal property tocollaborating parties under a CRADA pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §3710a. 9.1. Under an educational partnership (or other) agreement, and consistent with the applicable stat-utes, 10 U.S.C. §2194 and 15 U.S.C. §3710(i), the director of an Air Force laboratory may directlytransfer (donate) laboratory equipment that is surplus/excess to the needs of that laboratory, to publicand private schools and nonprofit institutions located, and using such equipment, within the territoriallimits of the United States. Determinations of property suitable for donation shall be made by the headof the laboratory. Title of ownership shall transfer as with gift under this section. Laboratory equip-ment donated to a recipient under 15 U.S.C. §3710(i) or 10 U.S.C. §2194 is not subject to existingFederal Property disposal regulations implementing separate authorities. AFI61-301   30 MAY 200199.1.1. For purposes of this instruction, “laboratory equipment" means equipment that is or couldbe used for scientific or scholarly investigation. This includes, but is not limited to, federal prop-erty that is useful in either an applied or theoretical fashion for the demonstration, performance, orinstruction of science, mathematics, engineering, or technology principles or practice at all levels.Laboratory equipment may be rather specialized, but also includes desktop computers and otherequipment designed for more general applications. 9.1.2. To ensure an Air Force laboratory is not donating equipment at one DoD location and pur-chasing the same equipment at another DoD location, property should be screened in accordancewith DoD policy. The Technology Transfer Handbook maintained by AFRL/XPTT shall containthe latest policy. 9.1.3. This donation authority shall not be used as a method of "dumping" excess property or asan alternative to authorized reduction to scrap. Property targeted for donation should be in work-ing condition. However, at the request of the donee, inoperable property may be donated. 9.1.4. Donated laboratory equipment should generally be free of charge. However, the donee maybe required to pay all costs associated with packing and transportation. 9.1.5. Laboratories and technical activities should be acutely aware that some property, ifexported, may be environmentally regulated and/or, if exported, may require a U.S. Department ofState or Commerce export license. Moreover, some property may require demilitarization or alter-ation for security purposes; standard eligibility criteria must be ensured and a screening processfor determining trade security control risks is mandatory. Accordingly, all laboratory equipment tobe donated must be screened to ensure compliance with DoD demilitarization requirements, secu-rity requirements and all environmental laws and regulations. 9.1.6. All donations pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2194 and 15 U.S.C. 3710(i) shall be reported in accor-dance with DoD reporting requirements. The current reporting requirements shall be identified inthe Technology Transfer Handbook maintained by AFRL/XPTT. 9.1.7. For those donations of “Educationally Useful Federal Equipment,” to “schools” pursuant toExecutive Order 12999, laboratories should use existing local procedures or if none are in place,use the procedures listed above. 9.2. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §3710(i), the Director of a laboratory or the head of any federal agency ordepartment may loan or lease research equipment that is excess to the needs of the laboratory, agency,or department to an educational institution or nonprofit organization for the conduct of technical andscientific education and research activities. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §3710a, a laboratory director mayprovide property (equipment), including access to supplies and services to maintain such property, tocollaborating party under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement. Pursuant to 10U.S.C. §2194, a laboratory director may loan defense laboratory equipment to an Education Institu-tion pursuant to an Education Partnership Agreement. 9.2.1. For purposes of this guidance, the terms loan, lease or provide shall be used synonymouslyand shall refer to providing either research or laboratory equipment on an exclusive, but time lim-ited, basis to an authorized recipient. 9.2.2. Laboratory and/or technical activity directors must only loan equipment to authorizedrecipients for the purposes authorized under the subject authorities. These are loans of: 9.2.2.1. Excess research equipment to educational institutions or nonprofit organizations for10AFI61-301   30 MAY 2001the conduct of technical and scientific education and research activities; 9.2.2.2. Property (equipment) to collaborating parties under a Cooperative Research andDevelopment Agreement for the conduct of specified research and development efforts whichare consistent with the missions of the laboratory; and 9.2.2.3. Defense laboratory equipment to local educational agency, colleges, universities, andany other nonprofit institutions that are dedicated to improving science, mathematics, andengineering education under an Education Partnership Agreement for the purpose of encour-aging and enhancing study in scientific disciplines at all levels of education. 9.2.3. All loans must be in writing and sufficiently identify the property loaned. 9.2.4. The terms of the loan can be set forth either in the terms of the authorized agreement(Cooperative Research and Development Agreement or Education Partnership Agreement), anattachment thereto, or in a separate agreement. The written agreements should include terms tosufficiently protect the DoD’s interest in the property. For example, the agreements should includeterms such as termination provisions, a duration provision, and/or a liability disclaimer. Labora-tory directors should also consider including the requirement that the recipient obtain appropriateinsurance coverage and/or other provisions that will insulate the DoD from liabilities stemmingfrom the recipient’s use of the loaned property. 9.2.5. Loans pursuant to a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement may be for a fee orfree of charge. Loans pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §3710(i) and 10 U.S.C. §2194 should be free ofcharge. However, the recipient may be required to pay all costs associated with packing and trans-portation. 9.2.6. All equipment to be loaned must be screened to ensure compliance with DoD demilitariza-tion requirements. 9.2.7. All equipment to be loaned must be screened to ensure compliance with all environmentallaws and regulations. 9.2.8. For any equipment which will be loaned and otherwise requires sustainment support, labo-ratory personnel and local logistics personnel shall establish procedures to provide such supportfor the loaned equipment, if necessary.

The educationalinstitutions referred to in the preceding sentence are local educational agency [agencies], colleges,universities, and any other nonprofit institutions that are dedicated to improving science, mathematics,and engineering education. Under such a partnership agreement, the director of an Air Force scientific andengineering activity may provide assistance to the educational institution by-- (1) loaning defenselaboratory equipment to the institution for any purpose and duration in support of such agreement that thedirector considers appropriate; (2) notwithstanding the provisions of the Federal Property andAdministrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 471 et seq.) or any provision of law or regulation relatingto transfers of surplus property, transferring to the institution any computer equipment, or other scientificequipment, that is-- (A) commonly used by educational institutions; AFI61-301   30 MAY 200113(B) surplus to the needs of the defense laboratory; and (C) determined by the director to be appropriate for support of such agreement; (3) making laboratorypersonnel available to teach science courses or to assist in the development of science courses andmaterials for the institution; (4) involving faculty and students of the institution in defense laboratoryresearch projects; (5) cooperating with the institution in developing a program under which students maybe given academic credit for work on defense laboratory research projects; and (6) providing academicand career advice and assistance to students of the institution. Laboratory and/or Technical Activity—For this instruction, that phrase is, as broadly defined, in 15U.S.C. 3710a(d)(2)(A), and shall include the following: A facility or group of facilities owned, leased, or otherwise used by the Air Force, a substantialpurpose of which is the performance of research, development, or engineering by employees of the AirForce. Use of this broad definition is deliberate. That definition is not confined to those Air Force com-ponents that are formally titled “laboratories.” The intent of that definition is to encompass the wide rangeof organizations and arrangements that function as laboratories and/or technical activities in Air Forceresearch, development, and engineering programs. It shall include laboratories and/or technical activitiesand reference more diverse arrangements that shall provide a virtual laboratory capability. For example,an Air Force component may have a virtual lab involving a management function accomplished in an AirForce activity, plus a dispersed set of research activities to be accomplished by a variety of organizationsoutside of the sponsoring and/or managing activity. Those capabilities are included in test, logistics, andproduct centers; depots; arsenals; program offices; and all Air Force offices providing for RDT&E. Thisis consistent with 15 U.S.C. 3710a(d)(2)(A) which uses such encompassing terms as “facility.” This broaddefinition is in accordance with new DoD practices. While the definition cited in 15 U.S.C. 3710a(d)(2)(A) occurs in a section of the United StatesCode dealing with CRADAs, the use of that broad definition in the DoD Directive 5535.3 and DoDInstruction 5535.8 shall not be limited to matters involving CRADAs. The broad definition applies to allcitations of laboratories and/or technical activities in this instruction. Office of Research and Technology Applications (ORTA)—Office required by 15 U.S.C. § 3710(b) tooversee the Domestic Technology Transfer Program at a laboratory and/or technical activity. Normally, anORTA comprises individuals with expertise in marketing, public relations, intellectual property, patentlaw, and scientific and technical information. Partnership Intermediary Agreement (PIA)—A Memorandum of Understanding or contract pursuantto 15 U.S.C. § 3715 with a partnership intermediary, as defined by 15 U.S.C. § 3715(c), that provides forthe partnership intermediary to perform services for the Air Force that increase the likelihood of successin the conduct of cooperative or joint activities of the Air Force with small businesses. Technology Transfer—The communication (sharing) of knowledge, expertise, facilities, equipment, andother resources, for application to military and non-military systems. Domestic technology transfer shallinclude the following: Spin-off activities that shall demonstrate DoD technology; e.g., commercial viability of technologiesalready developed or presently being developed for U.S. security purposes. The primary purpose of thoseactivities, which encompass much technology transfer, shall be to promote and make available existingDoD-owned or -developed technologies and technical infrastructure to a broad spectrum of non-DoDapplications. 14AFI61-301   30 MAY 2001Dual-use  science and technology  and  other  activities that  develop  technologies  that shall haveboth DoD and non-DoD applications. Spin-on promotion activities that shall demonstrate the U.S. security utility of technologies devel-oped outside of the DoD. That goal shall be to incorporate the innovative technology into military systemsto meet mission needs at a lower acquisition cost by taking advantage of the economies of scale by pur-chasing from a larger industrial base.
