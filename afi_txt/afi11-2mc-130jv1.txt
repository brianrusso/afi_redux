USAF policy dictates the use of formal schools unless attendance is impractical. training  method 1.4.1.  Formal schools will not forward written examinations as part of the courseware for in-unit qualification training. 1.4.2.  Students  previously  disenrolled  from  a  formal  ETCA  course  for  substandard performance are ineligible for a secondary method training waiver. 1.4.3.  AETC  and  AFSOAWC  are  the  primary  sources  for  formal  training  products.    When formal training products are unsuitable, units may use MAJCOM-developed products.  When specific formal courseware is not published, units may use locally-developed training syllabi that have been reviewed and approved by MAJCOM/A3T. 1.5.  Secondary  Method  Training  (SMT).  In-unit  training  using  applicable  formal  school courseware  is  referred  to  as  SMT  in  this  publication.    SMT  requires  a  waiver  be  submitted through appropriate channels per this instruction and approved by MAJCOM/A3T.  See AFI 11-202, Vol 1, as supplemented, for guidance.  (T-2) 1.6.  Waivers.  MAJCOM/A3  is  the  waiver  authority  for  MDS-specific,  Vol  1  aircrew  training requirements unless otherwise noted in this AFI.  Some ground and ancillary training items (e.g., small  arms  training,  etc.)  are  prescribed  by  other  instructions.    Reference  the  prescribing instruction to determine the waiver authority in these cases. 1.6.1.  Group  commanders  are  the  waiver  authority  for  individual,  case-by-case  flying  hour requirements and for ground and flying training requirements as outlined below. 1.6.2.  OG/CC  or  equivalent  (e.g.,  Combined  Joint  Special  Operations  Air  Component (CJSOAC)/CC) may: 1.6.2.1.  When  allowed  per  applicable  RTM,  extend  ground  training  requirement  due dates up to 2 months for certain noted training items.  (Exception:  Items referenced in Paragraph  1.6  levied  by  other  AFIs  may  not  be  waived  by  the  OG/CC  unless specifically authorized to do so in the source AFI).  When allowed per RTM, these events may count towards the next periodic requirements (units will note on waiver when events were accomplished and the ARMS due date will be updated).  (T-3) 1.6.2.2.  Extend  due  dates  for  the  duration  of  an  exercise,  contingency,  or  operational mission for events, IAW applicable RTM, on an individual basis only if a crew member goes  overdue  while  away  from  home  station  and  the  training  is  not  available  at  the   8  AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015 deployed location (Exception:  Items referenced in Paragraph. 1.6 levied by other AFIs may  not  be  waived  by  the  OG/CC  unless  specifically  authorized  to  do  so  in  the  source AFI).  (T-3) 1.6.2.3.  Waive flying training requirements IAW applicable RTM on an individual basis only.    Wings/groups  must  keep  an  accurate  record  of  waivers  granted.

Squadron commanders may carry new crew members as Mission Ready (MR) for up to 6 months if an aircrew member arrives at the unit after a PCS or formal school and is not MR in all core mission events.  Units completing formal training will include restrictions on AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, for a core item not trained, regardless if the method  of  qualification  is  by  evaluation  or  instructor  certification.    Under  no  circumstance will  aircrew  perform  events  in  which  they  are  not  qualified  unless  under  the  direct supervision of an instructor.  This policy does not apply to basic aircraft qualification events.  If  training  is  not  complete  in  6  months,  the  aircrew  member  becomes  mission  unqualified (and non-mission ready  (NMR)).  Squadrons will  have 6 months from  the time a new  core mission  event  is  added,  and  MAJCOM  guidance  issued,  to  train  and  qualify  aircrew  in  the new event.  (T-2) 1.7.

All  enlisted  aircrew AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015   9  qualifications  are  separate  and  distinct  from  skill  level  qualification.    When  an  AF  Form  8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, is completed for the applicable flight evaluation, then that crew member is qualified to perform all duties assigned to that crew qualification regardless of skill level.  Aircrew instructor qualifications and flight examiner certifications are also separate and distinct from On-The-Job (OJT) trainer or certifier designation and are reflected in Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) by use of “K” prefix (aircrew instructor) and “Q” prefix (aircrew flight examiner). 1.10.  Changes.  Recommendations  for  improvement  to  this  instruction  are  encouraged.    Send recommendations  to  AFSOC/A3T  through  command  channels,  on  an  AF  Form  847, Recommendation for  Change of  Publication.  AETC units will forward AF Form  847s through Stan/Eval  channels  to  AETC/A3V.    USAF/A3/5  is  the  approval  authority  for  changes  or revisions to this instruction.  Because of the dynamic requirements for Combatant Commanders, training requirements and currencies may be altered regularly.  These training requirements and currency  adjustments  may  be  made  via  RTM.    AFSOC/A3  will  be  an  info  addressee  on  all changes. 1.11.  Deviations.  This  instruction does not  authorize deviations from  the flight  manual  or any other  Air  Force  Instruction.    Flight  safety  will  be  given  prime  consideration  and  must  take precedence over the requirements and guidance of this instruction. 1.12.  Publication  Administration.  This  instruction  is  distributed  to  AFSOC,  AFSOC-gained units,  and  AFSOC-related  schools  based  on  requirements  established  through  the  Publications Distribution Office (PDO).  All MC-130J aircrew members are authorized this instruction. 1.12.1.  Supplements.    Forward  all  unit  or  MAJCOM  supplements  to  this  instruction  to AFSOC/A3TA,  who  in  turn  will  forward  to  USAF/A3OI  for  approval.   Provide AFSOC/A3TA,  and  applicable  MAJCOM/A3T  a  copy  of  all  approved  supplements.    If required by mission or location, units may supplement this instruction by coordinating with AFSOC/A3T before publication.   10  AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015 Chapter 2 QUALIFICATION TRAINING 2.1.  Overview.  This chapter outlines the means by which the minimum requirements for Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) training may be completed via initial qualification, requalification, conversion, or differences training.  Duties not directly related to qualification or requalification training should be minimized. 2.2.  General  Requirements.  The  primary  method  of  initial  qualification  and  requalification training is the appropriate formal training course listed in the ETCA.  If no requalification course exists, conduct requalification using the initial qualification course. 2.2.1.  For  Flight  Surgeon  (FS)  and  Medical  Technician  training  requirements,  refer  to AFI 11202,  Vol  1,  AFSOC  Supplement  1.    For  Combat  Camera  Aerial  Photographer Training requirements, refer to DoDI 5040.02, Visual Information (VI). 2.3.  Training  Prerequisites.  Course  prerequisites  are  IAW  the  appropriate  formal  course syllabus,  the  ETCA,  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1,  and  this  instruction.    The  formal  school  Syllabus  of Instruction (SOI) designates the course prerequisite approval authority. 2.3.1.  Basic  Aircraft  Qualification.    Due  to  the  formal  school  structure,  copilots  will  be trained  as  First  Pilots  (FP)  out  of  initial  qualification.    If  a  pilot  is  unable  to  maintain  FP status, squadron commanders can downgrade individuals to basic copilot (CP) status until he or she is ready to re-qualify as an FP per Chapter 4 of this regulation. Training  Requirements.  Complete 2.4.  Ground requirements IAW AFI 11202,  Vol  1,  the  ETCA,  and  the  formal  course  syllabus.

Refer  to Chapter 3 for mission difference training requirements. 2.6.1.  Conversion Training.  Unit  conversions follow AFI 11-202, Vol 1, as supplemented.  If  a  formal  school  course  is  unavailable,  OG/CCs  will  submit  in  unit  conversion  training requests through the chain of command for MAJCOM/A3 approval. 2.6.2.  Transition  Training  (TX).    Transition  training  is  a  shortened  version  of  initial qualification  training  that  gives  aircrew  members  cross-flowing  or  cross-decking  from another  military  aircraft  credit  for  acquired  aviation  proficiency.    Transition  of  mission-qualified C-130J pilots and loadmasters and legacy HC-130P/N and MC-130E/H/P Combat Systems Operators (CSOs) (mission qualified or previously mission qualified but out of the cockpit  less  than  36  months)  to  the  MC-130J  may  be  accomplished  using  a  MAJCOM-approved transition training syllabus.  (T2) 2.6.3.  Difference Training.  For aircraft and instrument qualification purposes, the MC-130J, HC-130J, EC-130J, C-130J, AC-130J, KC-130J, WC-130J, and C-130J-30 are considered to be different series of aircraft within the same MDS for BAQ. 2.6.3.1.  BAQ difference training to the MC-130J is authorized for the following: 2.6.3.1.1.  C-130J/C-130J-30/KC-130J.  Pilots and loadmasters. 2.6.3.1.2.  EC-130J and HC-130J.  Pilots, CSOs, and loadmasters. 2.6.3.1.3.  AC-130J.  Pilots, CSOs, and SOF Special Mission Aviators (SMAs). 2.6.3.2.  Primary  method  for  difference  training  is  via  completion  of  a  formal  school transition course.  If a TX is not available, the alternate method is via in-unit ground and flight training IAW MAJCOM-approved training plan.  Upon completion of differences training  and certification on the AF  Form  4348,  USAF Aircrew Certifications, the crew member is BAQ in the new aircraft. 2.6.3.3.  Difference  training  will  include  successful  completion  of  the  qualification written  open/closed  examinations.    Document  completion  of  difference  training  with instructor certification on the AF Form 4348 for the new aircraft.  (T-2) 2.6.3.4.  Aircrew members entered into difference training will complete training within 180 days after the first flight of the training program (12 months for ARC).  (T-3) 2.6.3.5.  Aircrew  members  may  maintain  previous  instructor,  evaluator,  air-to-air refueling  (AAR),  and  Maximum  Effort  qualifications/certifications  at  the  discretion  of the squadron commander.   12  AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015 2.7.  Multiple Qualifications.  Aircrew are authorized multiple qualifications in accordance with AFI  11-202,  Vol  1.    HC-130J  aircrews  at  the  FTU  are  authorized  multiple  qualification  in  the MC-130J. AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015   13  Chapter 3 MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT) 3.1.  Overview.  This  chapter  establishes  the  minimum  training  requirements  for  completing mission  qualification,  requalification,  and  differences  training.    Upon  completion  of  mission qualification training, the crew member will be assigned either Basic Mission Capable (BMC) or MR status. 3.2.  General  Requirements.  All crew members will complete initial, conversion, or transition qualification  prior  to  mission  qualification  training  and  mission  certification.    The  primary method of mission qualification or requalification is to complete the appropriate formal training course  listed  in  the  ETCA.    Completing  the  appropriate  formal  course  satisfies  the  training requirements of this chapter.  If no requalification course exists, conduct requalification using the initial mission qualification course.  When attendance is not practical or quotas are not available, units may request waivers to conduct SMT for mission qualification IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1, as supplemented. 3.2.1.  For  Flight  Surgeon  (FS)  and  Medical  Technician  training  requirements,  refer  to AFI 11202,  Vol  1,  AFSOC  Supplement  1.    For  Combat  Camera  Aerial  Photographer Training requirements, refer to DODI 5040.04, Joint Combat Camera (COMCAM) Program. 3.3.  Training  Prerequisites.  Course  prerequisites  are  IAW  the  appropriate  formal  course syllabus,  the  ETCA,  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1,  and  this  instruction.    The  formal  school  syllabus designates the course prerequisite waiver approval authority. 3.3.1.  Basic  qualification  and  mission  qualification training  may  be  accomplished simultaneously  on  a  single  MDS.    Multiple  MDS  qualification  upgrades  will  not  be accomplished simultaneously.  (T-2) 3.3.2.  Mission  Qualification.    Mission  Qualification  course  prerequisites  will  determine whether  or  not  a  pilot  will  be  trained  and  evaluated  as  a  Mission  Copilot  (MC)  or  Mission Pilot  (MP).    Pilots  must  meet  the  requirements  of  Table  5.1  in  order  to  be  certified  as Mission  Pilot  Aircraft  Commanders  (MPA).    Once  certified,  MPAs  may  fly  as  PIC  in  all qualified events.  Until the requirements of Table 5.1 are met, the pilot will fly as either an MP  or  MC.    Once  a  qualified  MP  meets  the  Table  5.1  requirements,  he  or  she  may  be certified as an MPA.  (T-2) 3.4.  Ground  Training  Requirements.  Complete  all  ground  training  in  Table  2.1,  Table  3.1, and  MAJCOM-specific  MC-130J  RTM  as  part  of  mission  qualification  training  or  prior  to certifying individuals as MR.  MR crew members transferred from other units require only unit-specific mission ready training events and events which are due/overdue. 3.4.1.  Academic  Training.    Complete  all  academic  and  ground  training  delineated  in applicable courseware. 3.4.2.  Written Examination.  Crew members must complete a written examination IAW AFI 11-2MC-130J, Vol 2.  The formal school will not forward their examinations as part of the courseware for in-unit qualifications.  (T-2)   14  AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015 Crew Position Note Table 3.1.

Not required for AETC crew members or formal school aircrew instructors.  If AETC crew members or formal school instructors are deployed for contingency or exercise augmentation, these events must be completed prior to deployment. 2.  Training Status Item.  Crew members will fly with an instructor until this event is accomplished. 3.5.  Flying  Training  Requirements.  Satisfactorily  completing  the  appropriate  formal  course satisfies  the  requirements  of  this  section.    Formal  course  training  will  include  all  core  mission events applicable to the crew member’s aircraft and crew position Table A3.1.  Approved in-unit mission qualification training must be accomplished  IAW  applicable  formal school  courseware and the guidance below:  (T-2) All All All All All All All All All All All   1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015   15  3.5.1.  Flying  training  lessons  should  be  completed  sequentially.    If  mission  scheduling  or student  progress  dictates  otherwise,  in-unit  training  sequences  may  be  changed  by  the squadron Director of Operations (DO). 3.5.2.  There  should  be  minimum  time  lapse  between  training  missions,  and  every  effort should be made to complete MQT requirements within the prescribed time period. 3.5.3.  Crew  member  requirements  may  be  completed  on  training  or  operational  missions under the supervision of an instructor in the same aircrew position.  Comply with restrictions in AFI 11-2MC-130J, Vol  3. 3.6.  MQT Difference Training. 3.6.1.  MQT  Difference  Training.    MQT  differences  training  to  the  MC-130J  is  authorized for  HC-130J  pilots,  CSOs,  and  loadmasters.    The  primary  method  for  accomplishing difference training is in-unit using a MAJCOM-approved syllabus.  (T-2) 3.6.1.1.  Difference  training  will  include  mission  open/closed  book  examinations  and  a flight evaluation per AFI 11-2MC-130J, Vol 2. 3.6.1.1.1.  Crew members previously qualified as HC-130J instructors.  Units may use the current AETC SOIs and courseware to conduct in-unit differences training to train and  qualify  HC-130J  qualified  instructors  and  evaluators  in  the  MC-130J.    Mission ready  HC-130J  crew  members  who  are  not  instructors  or  evaluators  will  not  be trained  using  the  AETC-developed  SOIs/courseware,  as  they  are  designed  for instructor/evaluator difference training. 3.6.1.2.  Crew  members  qualified  and  current  in  special  mission  events  may  regain  that qualification without additional training once they are BMC in their new aircraft.   16  AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015 Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  General Requirements. 4.1.1.  Requirements in this chapter and the RTM are the minimum flying and related ground training  to  maintain  currency  and  the  assigned  training  status.    Individual  proficiency  may require a greater number of events. 4.1.2.  Training  requirements  may  be  completed  on  any  sortie  if  the  accrediting  criteria  of this instruction and the MDS-specific RTM are met.  Sorties and events that are compatible may be credited on the same flight. 4.1.3.  Aircrew  members  will  not  log  continuation  training  requirements  in  events  in  which they are unqualified. 4.1.4.  Training events accomplished on a successful evaluation or an instructor certification (in certain events) will be credited toward the individual’s continuation training requirements in ARMS. 4.1.5.  Flying  training  events  accomplished  during  formal  training  will  use  the  course completion  date  (successful  evaluation  date)  to  establish  the  due  dates  for  all  subsequent currency  and  requirements.    For  all  events  not  required  to  be  accomplished  during  the evaluation,  log  volume  of  zero  in  ARMS,  but  enter  the  checkride/certification  date.    Use actual dates for all ground training. 4.1.6.  Aircrew Training Device (ATD) guidance. 4.1.6.1.  Formal training.  Certification events trained to a 3C level (or equivalent) in an approved  ATD  will  use  the  course  completion  date  (successful  evaluation  date)  as  the initial accomplishment date. 4.1.6.2.  Aircraft  flying  requirements,  to  include  updating  currency  or  obtaining recurrency, may be accomplished in a certified ATD for events designated in the MDS-specific RTM. 4.1.6.3.  Simulator  Crew  Complement.    In  order  to  log  events  in  a  Weapons  System Trainer (WST), simulator crews  will be  consistent  with  the the standard  front  end crew complement  needed  to  fly  an  aircraft,  to  include  an  aircraft  commander  for  the  type  of mission being flown.  (T-3) 4.2.  Training  Levels  (TL).  The  use  of  experienced-based  Flying  Training  Levels  (FTLs)  and Ground Training Levels (GTLs) allows the squadron commander to prioritize training resources.  Aircrew  members  must  meet  the  minimum  criteria  established  in  Paragraph  4.2.1,  and  Table 4.1, before assignment to the respective training level.  Squadron commanders may assign TLs to individuals  not  meeting  these  minimum  requirements  with  MAJCOM/A3T  approval.    When these  minima  are  met,  awarding  a  training  level  is  at  the  sole  discretion  of  the  squadron commander.  Note:  The aircrew member’s availability to fly should not be a factor in assigning FTLs.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015   17  4.2.1.  FTLs are based on minimum primary aircraft assigned (PAA) time and total time.  For basic qualification FTL, PAA time will include flight time and simulator time for any variant of C-130J.  For mission qualification FTL, MC-130J PAA time includes all MC-130J WST time, and up to 200 C/EC/HC/KC -130J WST hours.  Mission Qualification FTL includes up to  300  EC/HC-130J  aircraft  hours.    Total  hours  may  include  all  simulator  time.    Pilots upgrading  to  MPA  will  be  placed  in  FTL  C  for  three  semiannual  periods  and  must  meet minimum FTL requirements to upgrade to higher FTLs. 4.2.1.1.  FTL “A”- Highly experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members. 4.2.1.2.  FTL “B”- Experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members. 4.2.1.3.  FTL  “C”-  Inexperienced  BAQ  and/or  MR  aircrew  members;  all  copilots/MPD pilots. Table 4.1.  Minimum FTL Hour Requirements  (T-2). Crew Position FTL “A” FTL “B” PAA / Total Hours PAA / Total Hours Pilot 700/1,700 Combat Systems Officer (CSO) 700/1,700 Loadmaster 500/1,500 300/1,300 300/1,300 300/1,000 4.2.2.  Crew  members  may  be  assigned  different  FTLs  for  basic  and  mission  qualifications and  individual  events.    Example:    An  aircraft  commander  coming  from  EC-130s  might  be assigned basic FTL “A,” mission FTL “C,” with a caveat of FTL “A” for AAR. 4.2.3.  Change of FTL.  Once a semiannual period begins, personnel will not be moved to a level requiring fewer events until the next semiannual period.  (T-3) 4.2.4.  GTLs are based upon operational flying experience. 4.2.4.1.  GTL “1” – Aircrew members with 5 years or greater of operational flying. 4.2.4.2.  GTL “2” – Aircrew members with less than 5 years of operational flying. 4.3.  Proration of Training Requirements.  See AFI 11-202, Vol 1. 4.4.  Recurrency  and  Requalification  Training.  Training  is  required  whenever  an  aircrew member does not meet a currency requirement in this instruction.  An aircrew member will not perform events unsupervised until training has been accomplished.  (T-2) 4.4.1.  Loss of Currency.  Failure to accomplish events as outlined in the MDS-specific RTM results in a loss of currency for that event.  Crew members are noncurrent the day after event currency expires. 4.4.1.1.  Loss  of  currency  in  any  event  as  noted  in  the  MDS-specific  RTM  results  in supervised  status  until  recurrent.    (Exception:    FPs  that  lose  left  seat  landing  currency may fly in the right seat without an instructor). 4.4.1.2.  Crew members who maintain basic aircraft qualification in their primary aircraft and  a  ‘slick’  C-130J  variant  may  satisfy  currency  requirements  in  either  their  primary   18  AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015 aircraft  or  the  C-130J.    If  basic  semiannual  currency  is  lost  (failure  to  complete  the requirements  of  MDS-specific  RTM),  it  is  lost  for  both  aircraft.    Lost  basic  aircraft qualification  semiannual  currency  may  be  regained  in  either  aircraft.    Crew  members must complete at least one aircrew proficiency sortie in the C-130J semiannually.  Failure to complete at least one aircrew proficiency sortie in the C130J results in lost currency in the C-130J only and currency must be regained in the C-130J. 4.4.1.3.  Loss  of  currency  exceeding  6  months.    Non-currency  in  designated  BAQ  events (Table 4.2, Note 1  events) in  excess  of 6 months results in  loss of  BAQ.   Non-currency in designated  mission  events  IAW  applicable  RTM  in  excess  of  6  months  results  in  loss  of mission qualification status. 4.4.2.  Regaining Currency. 4.4.2.1.  Only Note 1 items in Table 4.2, and certain events as noted in applicable RTMs, require  an  evaluation  if  loss  of  currency  exceeds  6  months  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1.  Other  events  require  showing  proficiency  to  an  instructor  in  the  aircraft  or  ATD  (per MDS-specific  RTM)  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1,  to  regain  currency.    If  loss  of  currency exceeds 24 months in non-Note 1 events, a training folder will be opened and additional ground  and  flight  training,  as  directed  by  the  squadron  commander,  will  be  completed.  (T-2) 4.4.2.2.  Aircrew  noncurrent  in  special  mission  events  which  only  require  an  instructor certification (Table 5.4) may regain currency by showing proficiency in that event to an instructor. 4.4.2.3.  Aircrew noncurrent more than 24 months in special mission events requiring an evaluation per RTM will complete all initial training and evaluation requirements for that special mission event.  (T-2) 4.4.3.  Requalification  Training.    Crew  members  requiring  requalification  will  accomplish training IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1, applicable MAJCOM supplements, Chapter 2, Chapter 3, and Chapter 5 of this instruction, and the applicable RTM.  (T-2) 4.5.  Ground Training Guidelines.  AFI 11-202, Vol 1, and applicable RTMs, designate ground training requirements for all aircrew members.  Crew members will complete training within the time periods listed for their FTL/GTL IAW the referenced publications and the guidance below.  (T-2) 4.5.1.  Failure  to  Complete  Ground  Training  Events.    Accomplish  make-up  training  at  the earliest  opportunity.    The  following  apply  when  crew  members  exceed  due  dates  for applicable RTM events: 4.5.1.1.  Grounding  items.    Crew  members  will  not  perform  flight  duties  until  the grounding item is satisfied.  (T-2) 4.5.1.2.  Training status items.  Crew members will not fly without instructor supervision.  (T-2) 4.5.1.3.  MR items.  Failure to accomplish MR events in applicable RTM results in non-mission ready status.  The individual will not deploy as a crew member.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015   19  4.5.2.  Block Training (AFSOC only).  Each group operations training office should establish and administer a centralized aircrew block training session.  Block training should include all recurring ground training required to maintain readiness. 4.5.3.  Simulator  Refresher  Course.    The  periodic  simulator  refresher  course  is  designed  to improve  standardization  and  to  provide  maximum  training  on  normal,  instrument,  and emergency  procedures.    The  primary  purpose  for  simulator  refresher  training  is  to accomplish  events  that  are  unable  to  be  accomplished  or  potentially  unsafe  in  the  aircraft.  These events should be accomplished in both qualification and tactical scenarios.  Simulator refresher  instruction  can  be  provided  by  an  Aircrew  Training  System  (ATS)  contractor  or position-specific aircrew instructor, using MDS-specific SOI and formal school courseware.  Units  or  crew  members  who  desire  to  practice  specific  events  will  identify  those requirements  on  the  first  day  of  training.    Satisfactory  completion  of  formal  school  basic aircraft  qualification,  requalification,  or  aircraft  commander  course,  which  includes instruction in  a C-130-type simulator, as well as  the instructor upgrade  course, satisfies the simulator refresher course requirement. 4.5.3.1.  The recommended minimum crew size for this course is an aircraft commander, copilot,  CSO, and two loadmasters  (LMs).    If units are unable to  provide the minimum crew  size,  they  will  ensure  that  the  ATS  contractor  is  able  to  support  less  than  the minimum crew, otherwise, the ATS contractor is not required to provide the training. 4.5.3.2.  Instructors  may  credit  simulator  refresher  when  they  instruct  a  full  simulator refresher course (ARC-only: ATS contractors who are also qualified crew members may credit simulator refresher when teaching the course in a civilian capacity). 4.5.3.3.  Simulator refresher training is not required for aircrew members who will not be flying the same type or similar aircraft beyond 4 months after their due date. 4.5.3.4.  When  MC-130J  WSTs  are  not  available  for  training,  HQ  AFSOC/A3TA  will acquire  C-130J  simulator  refresher  courses  at  various  locations  to  serve  as  alternate training for this requirement. 4.5.4.  Visual  Threat  Recognition  and  Avoidance  Trainer  (VTRAT)  Training.    Periodic VTRAT  training  is  designed  to  introduce  or  refresh  crew  members  in  the  basics  of  aircraft threat  engagement  recognition  and  avoidance.    The  VTRAT  simulation  displays  realistic visual characteristics of anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) such as missile fly-out and AAA rate-of-fire, as seen from the scanner’s viewpoint in the aircraft.  Training will include: 4.5.4.1.  Group/individual  academics  on maneuvers IAW AFTTP 3-1.E/MC-130J and AFTTP 3-3.E/MC-130J.  (T-3) threat  recognition,  calls  and  avoidance 4.5.4.2.  Following  academics,  individuals  will  receive  ~30  minutes  of  individual simulator time on the VTRAT.  (T-3) 4.6.  Ancillary  Training.  Ancillary  training  is  any  guidance  or  instruction  that  contributes  to mission  accomplishment,  but  is  separate  from  an  Air  Force  Specialty  or  occupational  series.  Some  ancillary impact  mission  ready  status  or  mobility  status.  AFI 112MC130J, Vol 1. and associated MAJCOM-specific RTM are not the governing directive for  completion  of  ancillary  training  events.    They  do  not  include  ancillary  training  required  by AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.  This includes Total Force Awareness Training and training  does  not   20  AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015 Expeditionary Skills Training, which will be tracked at unit level.  Individuals are responsible for completing  additional  ancillary  ground  training  requirements  as  specified  in  applicable instructions.  In accordance with AFI 11-202, Vol 1, the source AFI provides training frequency for these events unless an approved waiver has been authorized.  See Unit Deployment Manager to ensure compliance with additional non-aircrew specific training requirements. 4.7.  Flying Training. 4.7.1.  All  aircrew  members  who  maintain  BAQ,  BMC,  or  MR  status  must  accomplish  all applicable  training  requirements  of    Table  4.2  and  the  MAJCOM-specific  MC-130J  RTM, based  on  assigned  FTL  (A,  B,  or  C).    See  MAJCOM-specific  MC-130J  RTM  for  more detailed currency and volume flying requirements by FTL.  BMC and MR aircrew will also comply with the following:  (T-2) Table 4.2.

Only these events require an evaluation if loss of currency exceeds 6 months per   AFI 11-202, Vol 1. 2.  Failure to accomplish event, within specified time, results in loss of basic aircraft currency. 3.  Failure to accomplish event, within specified time, results in loss of mission currency. 4.  Non-currency in this event results in loss of currency in this sub area. 5.  Non-currency in this events results in loss of currency in only that event. 4.7.1.1.  MR  aircrew  members  will  also  accomplish  applicable  mission  ready requirements  as  designated  in  the  MAJCOM-specific  MC-130J RTM  according  to  their mission qualification and FTL.  (T-2) 4.7.1.2.  BMC aircrew members will also accomplish at least 50 percent of the applicable mission requirements as designated in the MAJCOM-specific MC-130J RTM according to their assigned FTL.  (T-2) 4.7.1.3.  BAQ  FPAs  and  FPs  will  maintain  currency  IAW  RTM  in  either  seat  (unless seat-specific).  Emphasis should be on left seat flying.  Local Proficiency Sorties should be flown in the left seat.  FPs will only accomplish max effort takeoffs and landings when under the direct supervision of an instructor pilot.  Prior qualified pilots (PQPs) who are FPs, may fly in the left seat for basic airland missions when an aircraft commander who has  a  minimum  of  100  hours  since  certification  occupies  the  right  seat.    AFI  11-2MC-130J, Vol 3. further defines takeoff and landing policy.  CPs will maintain currency IAW Table 4.2 in the right seat only.  (T-2) 4.7.1.4.  Instructors  and  flight  examiners  may  not  log  events  performed  by  other  crew members  during  instruction  or  evaluations.    Exception:  AETC:  With  squadron commander  approval,  formal  school  instructors  may  log  50%  of  volume  requirements and update currency with events accomplished by students under their direct supervision. 4.7.2.  Flying  Currency  Event  Definitions.    Refer  to  MAJCOM-specific  MC-130J  RTM  for complete  semiannual  volume  and  currency  events  and  their  definitions.    Failure  to accomplish currency or volume requirements results in loss of basic aircraft currency.  Flight Surgeons will log currency IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1 requirements. 4.8.  Multiple Qualifications.  Refer to AFI 11-202, Vol 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program,  MAJCOM  supplements,  and  AFI  11-2MDS-specific,  Vol  2  for  crew  positions  and evaluation requirements.  Refer to AFI 11-202, Vol 1 concerning approval authority for multiple qualifications.    Multiple  qualified  crew  members  will  have  one  aircraft  designated  as  their primary aircraft.  Other aircraft will be considered secondary aircraft.  All AFSOC C-130J crew members  are  authorized  multiple  qualification their  primary  mission  aircraft (i.e., MC130J, EC-130J, and AC-130J) and a “slick” C-130J variant for BAQ.  Multiple aircraft qualified  crew  members  may  credit  basic  proficiency  and/or  mission  sorties  on  any  aircraft  in which  qualification  and  currency  is  maintained.    Events  which  can  be  credited  are  based  on qualification held in each MDS. in   22  AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015 4.8.1.  Multiple qualified aircrew members must complete 100 percent of the requirements of Table  4.2  and  the  MAJCOM-specific  MC-130J  RTM.    Multiple  qualified  crew  members may complete Table 4.2 and the MDS-specific RTM requirements in either aircraft, but must maintain  aircrew  proficiency  sortie  currency  in  each  aircraft.    The  basic  qualification  FTL assigned to an individual should be the highest experience level (fewest requirements) of any aircraft  in  which  they  maintain  qualification.    For  example,  a  crew  member  qualified  as mission FTL A in the MC-130J and mission FTL B in the EC-130J should have an FTL A basic qualification profile.  (T-2) 4.8.2.  Multiple  qualified  crew  members  who  maintain  MR  or  Combat  Mission  Ready (CMR)  status  in  more  than  one  AFSOC  C/MC-130  aircraft  must  complete  the  semiannual mission  ready  flying  requirements  in  Table  4.2  and  the  MDS-specific  RTM.    Multiple qualified crew members may accomplish mission events in either aircraft, but will fly at least one  Combat  Mission  Profile  (CMP)  quarterly  in  each  aircraft  in  which  they  are  mission ready.    When  the  training  table  for  the  secondary  aircraft  contains  core  mission  events  not required in the primary aircraft, crew members will complete required volume and currency for those events in their secondary aircraft.  If mission flying currency is lost for the primary aircraft, it is lost for all aircraft and  must be regained in the designated primary aircraft.  If mission currency is lost in a secondary aircraft, it is lost only for that aircraft.  (T-2) 4.8.2.1.  MC-130J  MR  crew  members  who  maintain  BAQ  in  a  C-130  variant  may accomplish  requirements  listed  in  the  MAJCOM-specific  MC-130J  RTM  as  allowed  in the RTM and this publication’s Table 4.2. AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015   23  Chapter 5 UPGRADE/SPECIALIZED TRAINING 5.1.  General.  This  chapter  identifies  the  prerequisites  and  training  requirements  for  qualified aircrew members upgrading to additional levels  of qualification and certification in  specialized flight events. 5.1.1.  The  flying  time  prerequisites  for  upgrade  are  based  on  the  crew  member  having gained  the  knowledge  and  judgment  required  to  effectively  accomplish  the  unit’s  missions.  Sq/CCs  will  ensure  their  continuation  training  programs  emphasize  these  areas.    Crew members  will  have  an  in-depth  knowledge  of  systems,  procedures,  and  instructions  before entering the formal upgrade program. 5.2.  MC-130J  Pilot  Development  through  Aircraft  Commander  Upgrade.  MC-130J  pilots graduate  from  the  FTU  as  a  MP  or  MC  depending  on  their  flying  experience  (refer  to  course prerequisites  for  actual  requirements).    Due  to  the  formal  school  structure,  copilots  will  also graduate from the FTU as BAQ First Pilots (FP).  The guidance in this section refers to upgrade of Mission Ready copilots to aircraft commander.  (T-2) 5.2.1.  Documentation.  Completion of AFSOC MC-130J Pilot Phase I and II is documented in ARMS as G261Q and G262Q respectively.  Document the completion of the entire course via AF Form 4324 and Sq/CC certification. 5.2.2.  Training Guides.  AFSOC MC-130J Pilot Phase I (G261Q) & II (G262Q) guides are available for download from the AFSOC Bookstore Sharepoint Site.  The appropriate guide should be carried on all sorties to maximize training opportunities. 5.2.3.  MC-130J Pilot Phase I.  Upon obtaining Mission Ready status, copilots enter Phase I of continuation training.  This first phase consists of completing the MC-130J Pilot Phase I guide (G261Q), which focuses on core aircraft abilities including communication, checklist discipline, systems knowledge, and basic mission planning.  A Phase I copilot should not be expected  to  act  as  an  Aircraft  Commander,  yet  they  should  observe  and  learn  from  their aircrew leadership. 5.2.3.1.  During this stage of pilot development, a Phase I copilot is restricted to the right seat  for  mission  sorties  and  may  only  occupy  the  aircraft  left  seat  with  an  IP.    Phase  I copilots will train in the right seat during refresher sims and may occupy the left or right seats for proficiency sims (and available proficiency time at the end of a refresher sim).  All Tactical/Mission events will be flown in the right seat.  Phase I copilots will complete the Phase I guide NLT 180 days (365 days for ARC) after becoming mission ready.  (T-2) 5.2.3.2.  In order to advance beyond Phase I, the Phase I copilot must be at least 6 months from the training start date, have a minimum of 200 MC-130J hours (flying and simulator time), and have completed the Pilot Phase I guide.  Once these requirements are met, the Phase  I  pilot  may  be  approved  for  Phase  II  via  the  squadron  Training  Review  Board (TRB).  (Note: For copilots who were Mission Ready prior to the release of this AFI and have over 200 MC-130J hours, completion of Phase I is not required).  For FAIP/OSA or   24  AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015 SOF  cross-flow  pilots  transitioning  to  MC-130J  aircraft,  completion  of  Phase  I  is  not required; however, Phase II is required. 5.2.4.  MC-130J Pilot Phase II.  This phase consists of completing the MC-130J Pilot Phase II  guide  (G262Q),  which  focuses  on  the  core  tasks  of  flying  skills,  mission  situational awareness, and crew management required for Aircraft Commander certification. 5.2.4.1.  Training in this stage will ensure a balanced exposure to both left and right seats in the aircraft with an AC or above.  Good judgment and Operational Risk Management (ORM) will dictate with whom they fly and what seat they occupy.  As Phase II copilots advance in knowledge, they are encouraged to practice actual mission management skills and decision making under the guidance of their AC or IP.  (T-2) 5.2.5.  MC-130J Copilot Selection for Aircraft Commander Upgrade/Certification.  Phase II copilots must meet prerequisites defined in Table 5.1 as well as complete the Phase II guide.  (T2) 5.2.5.1.  Based  upon  performance,  experience,  and  requisite  flight  hours,  Phase  II copilots  will  be  identified  for  upgrade  by  squadron  leadership  via  the  TRB.    Phase  II copilots  require  a  minimum  of  one  AF  Form  8  evaluation  after  CP  mission  ready certification  and  prior  to  entry  into  Aircraft  Commander  upgrade  (N/A  for  SOF/MAF cross-flow, or FAIP/OSA).  (T-2) 5.2.5.2.  Conduct In-unit Training using AFSOC MC-130J Aircraft Commander Upgrade Qualification  SOI.    The  training  will  culminate  in  a  MP  evaluation  IAW  AFI  11-2MC-130, Vol 2.  See Paragraph 5.3 for AC certification requirements.  (T-2) Table 5.1.  Minimum Hours Required to Upgrade to MC-130J Aircraft Commander  (T-2). TOTAL PILOT HOURS PMAI HOURS Over 1,900 1,300-1,899 900-1,299 Notes: 200 300 700 1.  All pilots with prior rotary-wing time will be trained as copilots unless they have a minimum of  500  hours  of  fixed-wing  time  (including  Undergraduate  Pilot  Training  (UPT)  flying  time).       (T-2) 2.    For  the  purpose  of  this  table,  PMAI  hours  includes  any  type  of  C-130J  aircraft.    Subtract “Other” flight time in excess of 100 hours from total hours.  Subtract all “Other” time from the required PMAI time.  Add all simulator hours toward Total  and  all  C/HC/KC/MC-130J WST time toward PMAI hour requirements. 5.3.  Aircraft  Commander  Certification.  Pilots  will  not  fly  as  a  pilot-in-command  until certified by the Sq/CC as an aircraft commander.  (T-2) 5.3.1.  Following  completion  of  Aircraft  Commander  upgrade  training,  pilots  should  be certified as an aircraft commander within 120 days unless extenuating circumstances exist. AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015   25  5.3.2.  Prior Qualified Pilots (PQP) Certification.  PQPs evaluated according to mission pilot standards  during  MQT  will  enter  a  unit-developed  AC  certification  program  and  may  be certified  after  attaining  a  minimum  of  100  MC-130J  PAA  hours.    Waiver  authority  for  the prerequisite  is  the  OG/CC.    The  100  PAA  hours  includes  HC/KC/MC-130J  WST  time.  Exception: “Other” time will not be used.  (T-3) 5.3.3.  FP  Aircraft  Commander  (FPA).    C-130J  ACs  transitioning  to  the  MC-130J  may  be certified as FPA.  All other C-130J FPs must meet the requirements of Table 5.1 in order to be certified as First Pilot Aircraft Commanders (FPA).  Selected individuals will be entered into  a  unit-developed  certification  program  to  ensure  they  have  the  experience,  knowledge and  judgment  to  act  in  this  capacity.    Once  certified,  FPAs  may  fly  as  pilot-in-command (PIC) only in basic aircraft qualification events.  (T-2) 5.4.  Instructor Upgrade.  A sound and practical aircrew instructor program is a prerequisite for effective training, standardization, and aircraft mishap prevention. instructor  candidate’s 5.4.1.

Ancillary  Training—Universal  training,  guidance,  or  instruction,  regardless  of  Air  Force Specialty  Code  (AFSC),  that  contributes  to  mission  accomplishment.    It  does  not  include functional,  occupational,  or  additional  duty  training.    Ancillary  Training  is  divided  into  the following  four  categories:    Annual  Total  Force  Awareness  Training  (TFAT),  Selected  Force Training,  Event  Driven  Training,  and  Expeditionary  Skills  Training  (EST).    See  AFI  36-2201, Vol 1. Backup  Aircraft  Inventory  (BAI)—Aircraft  assigned  to  a  unit  to  assist  in  maintaining readiness.  Aircraft designated as BAI assets do not receive funding or manning consideration for the unit. Basic  Aircraft  Qualification  Aircrew  Member—An  aircrew  member  who  has  satisfactorily completed  qualification  training  in  the  basic  aircrew  position  and  maintains  aircraft  currency IAW this instruction.  The aircrew member, when current, may perform the events in Table 4.2. Basic  Mission  Capable  Aircrew  Member—An  aircrew  member  who  has  satisfactorily completed  mission  qualification  and  is  maintaining  50  percent  of  the  applicable  mission qualification  currency  requirements  of  this  instruction.    Basic  mission  capable  crew  members may  perform  primary  crew  duties  on  any  unilateral  training  mission.    For  other  missions,  the squadron commander must determine the readiness of each basic mission capable crew member to perform primary crew duties. Calendar Month—Requirements are due once per month and not necessarily associated with a 30/60  day  requirement.    For  example,  an  aircrew  member  could  accomplish  the  event  on 1 February and then on 31 March the following month and still fulfill the requirement. Combat  Mission  Ready  (CMR)—A  status  of  an  aircrew  member  who  has  satisfactorily completed  mission  qualification  training  and  maintains  qualification  and  proficiency  in  the command or unit combat mission. Conversion Training—Training is normally associated with a unit conversion to another MDS.  Conversion training requires completion of a formal school initial qualification course.  For unit conversions, when formal school courses are not available to handle the throughput, MAJCOMs will develop, and coordinate with the training command, in-unit training plans that maximize use of highly experienced personnel as the initial cadre. AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015   35  Core  Mission  Events—A  crew  member  must  be  qualified  in  all  core  mission  events  to  be considered  Mission  Ready  (MR)  or  Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC).    To  determine  how  non-currency  in  any  core  mission  event  affects  overall  mission  currency,  refer  to  the  aircraft’s mission ready flying requirements.  Loss of qualification in any core mission event results in loss of overall mission qualification.  A core mission event will be considered an instructor certified event when it is not required to be evaluated on the Initial Mission Evaluation.  Squadrons will maintain at least 100 percent of their required manning as MR.  AFSOC squadron CC/DO will determine  the  status/qualification  of  crew  members  in  excess  of  100  percent  manning requirement. Difference Training—Training accomplished when changing between same design aircraft and the  amount  of  training  needed  for  qualification  does  not  warrant  attendance  at  a  formal qualification course. Event—A  training  item  to  be  accomplished.    Multiple  events  may  be  completed  and  logged during a sortie unless specifically excluded elsewhere in this instruction. Expeditionary  Skills  Training  (EST)—A  category  of  Ancillary  Training.    Training  directly related to an Airman’s ability to survive and operate in a contingency environment.  Examples of EST include chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN), and Self-Aid/Buddy Care. A at  AEF  Online, https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.mil/mandatory_exped_trning.aspx. predeployment available training is current list of Formal  School  Courseware—Training  materials  and  programs  developed  for  training  crew members  at  formal  schools.    It  includes  all  student  study  guides,  workbooks,  computer-based training  lessons,  instructor  guides,  and  applicable  training  forms  related  to  the  specific  course. Training courses listed in ETCA.  Formal courses may be conducted using the secondary method (in-unit) of training IAW the provisions of this instruction Formation  Operations—Accomplish  IAW  applicable  volume(s)  of  AFTTP,  AFI 112MC130J, Vol  3,  and  ATP-56(B).    AFSOC  guidance  will  never  be  less  restrictive  than  the  formation definitions  found  in  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  “Formation  Flight,”  “Nonstandard  Formation,”  and “Standard Formation.”  Formation operations place all aircraft in a critical phase of flight which requires  constant  vigilance,  strict  discipline,  and  polished  crew  coordination  for  mission accomplishment.  Training will ensure aircrew can think and plan for multiple aircraft instead of single ship operations. Instructor  Certified  Events—Training given to  an aircrew member that requires an instructor to certify the student's attainment of the required proficiency and knowledge levels as specified in courseware and, if appropriate, AF Form 4111.  Instructor certified events are documented in AF Form 4348 (or MAJCOM-approved substitute). Mission  Design  Series—The  official  designation  for  aerospace  vehicles  used  to  represent  a specific category of aerospace vehicles for operations, support, and documentation purposes. Mission  Essential  Task  List—Combat-oriented  training  requirements.    All  AFSOC  aircrew training requirements should be in support of unit METLs. Mission  Events—The  unit  Defined  Operational  Capability  (DOC)  Statement  defines  required crew capabilities.  These capabilities/tactics/events can be categorized as either Core or Special Mission.   36  AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015 Mission  Ready  Aircrew  Member—An  aircrew  member  who  has  satisfactorily  completed mission  qualification  and  is  maintaining  all  of  the  applicable  mission  qualification  currency requirements of this instruction. Multiple Qualification—A crew member who is qualified in more than one MDS. Primary  Mission  Aircraft  Inventory—Aircraft  assigned  to  a  unit  for  performance  of  its wartime  mission.    PMAI  forms  the  basis  for  the  allocation  of  operating  resources  to  include manpower, support equipment, and funding of flying hours. Requalification Training (RQT)—Training required to qualify crew members in an aircraft or mission in which they have been previously qualified. Secondary  Method  Training—Formal  training  conducted  at  a  location  not  designated  as  an FTU using SOI and courseware. Self-Contained Approach—An approach conducted using self-contained navigation systems on the aircraft. Special Mission Events—Mission events not designated as a “core event.”  Some MR/MC crew members  will  carry  additional  qualifications  in  special  mission  events.    Squadron  CC/DO  will determine  which  crew  members  will  be  qualified  in  these  special  mission  events.    Squadron CC/DO  will  determine  if  special  mission  events  have  affected  C-rating  and  report  variations through Status of Resources and Training Systems (SORTS). Total Flying Time—Total time for all aircraft flown in military service to include student time.  Time accumulated must be in the aircrew member's current rating (i.e., pilot, navigator, etc.). Training Status—A deficient status in which a crew member must fly under the supervision of an instructor when occupying a primary crew position.  Once deficient items are corrected, the crew member is removed from training status. Transition  Training  (TX)—Normally, a shortened version of initial  qualification training that gives aircrew members cross-flowing from another military aircraft credit for acquired aviation proficiency. Upgrade  Training—Training  to  qualify/certify  a  crew  member  in  a  higher  crew  qualification (i.e., mission pilot or instructor upgrade). Volume—For the purposes of this instruction, volume refers to the number of events an aircrew member must accomplish in a given period of time (i.e., quarterly or semiannually). Weapon  System  Trainer  (WST)—Device tactics environment, in which aircrews learn, develop, improve, and integrate skills associated with their crew position.  In this instruction, WST and simulator are synonymous. that  provides  synthetic  flight  and  AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015   37  Attachment 2 CHEMICAL DEFENSE TASK QUALIFICATION TRAINING (CDTQT) A2.1.  General.  This attachment contains the initial and recurring aircraft CDTQT requirements for AFSOC aircrews.  The purpose of CDTQT is to  reinforce the  crew member's awareness  of limitations  and  demonstrate  physiological  effects  while  wearing  the  aircrew  chemical  defense ensemble  (ACDE).    The  complications  of  heat  exhaustion,  fatigue,  hyperventilation,  limited dexterity,  and  hampered  communication  can  all  be  experienced  during  CDTQT.    All  aircrew members must complete initial  aircrew chemical defense training prior to  accomplishing initial CDTQT.    Complete  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear  (CBRN)  Defense Awareness and CBRN Defense Survival Skills training prior to CDTQT if the ground ensemble is used.  Initial CDTQT should be done in the aircraft.  If initial CDTQT is done in the simulator, the next event must be logged in the aircraft.  All other times the event may be accomplished in the simulator.  (T-2) A2.2.  CDTQT Procedures. A2.2.1.  Accomplish  CDTQT  in-flight  using  the  primary  unit  aircraft.    Crew  members  will perform  primary  crew  duties  while  wearing  the  ACDE.    All  in-flight  profiles  must  be  a minimum of 1 hour and accomplished on training missions only.  Accomplish CDTQT in the simulator using primary unit aircraft WSTs.  All simulator profiles must be a minimum of 2 hours and flown on full tactical simulation profiles.  This should include a threat scenario and aircraft  emergencies.    Flying  the  simulator  profile  with  the  entire  crew  wearing  ACDE  is highly encouraged.  (T-2) A2.2.2.  The entire ACDE need not be used.  Normally, wear the blower assembly unit, inter-communications  box,  cotton  gloves,  butyl  rubber  gloves,  nomex  gloves,  Aircrew  Eye  and Respiratory  Protection  System  (AERPS)  mask  hood,  and  helmet  (if  applicable).    Either  the ACDE  or  ground  ensemble  may  be  worn  during  aircraft  preflight.    Ground  ensembles  will come from training assets. A2.2.3.  When  wearing  the  Chemical  Protective  Overgarment  (CPO)  mask,  do  not accomplish  CDTQT when required to  wear Night Vision Goggles (NVGs).  When wearing AERPS, NVG events will be accomplished.  (T-2) A2.2.4.  An observer is required to monitor each crew member while accomplishing CDTQT inflight.   An instructor or flight  examiner in  each respective crew position, not  wearing the chemical defense components, will act as the observer for initial CDTQT.  Exception:  An IP not  wearing  the  ensemble  and  not  performing  any  other  instructor  duties  may  act  as  the observer  for  initial  CSO  training.    During  recurring  CDTQT,  if  the  crew  member  can  be directly  observed  by  another  primary  crew  member,  a  dedicated  observer  is  not  required.  The  dedicated  observer  during  recurring  CDTQT  may  also  wear  AERPS  for  all  crew positions  except  pilots  (two  non-pilot  crew  members  wearing  AERPS  may  observe  one another).  Additionally, for safety purposes, one crew member in the back of the aircraft must not  be  wearing  AERPS  in  case  of  smoke  and  fumes.    For  any  airdrop  mission,  a  fully qualified  loadmaster  must  not  be  wearing  AERPS  in  case  of  an  airdrop  malfunction.  Example: during an MC-130J flight with a full mission crew complement, all crew members, with the exception of one mission pilot occupying a pilot seat and one crew member in the back,  may  wear  AERPS  if  all  of  these  crew  members  have  previously  completed  initial   38  AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015 CDTQT.  If this is an airdrop mission, the crew member in the back must be a loadmaster.  Dedicated observers not wearing AERPS for non-pilot crew members are not required in this case.  (T-2) A2.2.4.1.  An  instructor  or  flight  examiner  pilot  not  wearing  the  chemical  defense components will occupy the opposite seat during initial pilot CDTQT.  During recurring CDTQT, a mission ready pilot not wearing the chemical defense components will act as the  observer  and  occupy  the  opposite  seat.    With  squadron  commander  approval,  both pilots  may  wear  AERPS  while  occupying  the  pilot  seats  provided  both  pilots  have accomplished CDTQT within the past 90 days.  The squadron commander may delegate this authority to the squadron DO or mission commander.  (T-2) A2.2.4.2.  Observers  will  closely  monitor  crew  members  actions  during  CDTQT.    If  a crew  member  experiences  difficulties  such  as  excessive  thermal  stress,  headaches, hyperventilation, nausea, etc., the crew member will remove the ensemble.  The observer will notify the PIC of any difficulties encountered. A2.3.  Mission  Profile.  Aircrew  members  will  accomplish  CDTQT  during  a  normal  tactical profile.  In addition: A2.3.1.  Pilots  will  accomplish  a  minimum  of  one  approach  and  landing.    Pilots  may accomplish CDTQT in either seat.  (T-2) A2.3.2.  All  other  crew  members  will  credit  CDTQT  while  performing  their  normal  crew duties during the specified events  (T-2).  AFI11-2MC-130JV1  1 MAY 2015   39  Attachment 3 CORE MISSION AND SPECIAL MISSION TRAINING REQUIREMENTS A3.1.
