Sound  Judgment.  These  procedures  provide  guidance  to  plan  and  execute  LC-130  ski operations  in  polar  environments.    Instructions  in  this  AFI  are  intended  to  provide  the  best possible operating procedures across a wide range of circumstances, but cannot account for every possible situation a crewmember may encounter during a ski mission.  Planners and aircrew must use sound judgment and operational risk management to manage unique mission demands. 1.2.  General.  The  LC-130  is  a  highly  flexible,  all-weather,  multi-mission  weapon  system, providing the capability to operate from a wide range of non-standard landing surfaces. 1.2.1.  AFI  11-2C-130V3  Addendum  D  Annex  A  consists  of  LC-130  specialized  briefings and checklists.  This annex will be published and reviewed by NGB/A3M. 1.2.2.  AFI  11-2C-130V3  Addendum  D  Annexes  B  &  C  detail  LC-130  theater  operations; Annex  B  (Antarctic  Operations)  and  Annex  C  (Arctic  Operations).  Throughout  this document these annexes are referred to as theater annexes.  These annexes are published and reviewed as required by NGB/A3M. 1.2.3.  AFI  11-2C-130V3  Addendum  D  Annex  D  details  LC-130  Deep  Field  Mission Planning and Execution.   This annex is published and reviewed by NGB/A3M 1.3.  Deviations  and  Waivers.  Do  not  deviate  from  policies  in  this  AFI  except  when  the situation  demands  immediate  action  to  ensure  safety.    The  Pilot  in  Command  (PIC)  is  vested with ultimate mission authority and responsible for each course of action they choose to take. 1.3.1.  Deviations.    The  PIC  shall  report  deviations  or  exceptions  taken  without  a  waiver through command channels to their Chief, Major Command (MAJCOM) Stan/Eval. 1.3.2.  Waivers.  Unless  otherwise  directed,  and  in  accordance  with  (IAW)  AFI  11-202V3, waiver authority for the content  of this  instruction is  MAJCOM/A3 with mission  execution authority.    For  USTRANSCOM/AMC  operational  missions  under  Operational  Control (OPCON)  of  18  Air  Force,  18  AF/CC  is  the  waiver  authority.    For  aircrews  that  Change Operational Control (CHOP) to a Combatant Command (CCMD) the Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) is the waiver authority. AFI11-2C-130V3ADDD  22 JULY 2016   5  Chapter 2 COMMAND AND CONTROL 2.1.  Command  and  Control  (C2).  Refer  to  applicable  theater  annexes  and  applicable  theater Operations Orders (OPORD’s) for specific C2 requirements. 2.2.  Search and Rescue (SAR) Requirements.  Due to the increased risks associated with LC-130  operations,  a  SAR  aircraft  is  required  for  operations  to  any  site  without  manned  ground support (T-2). Manned ground support will include weather reporting, food, shelter, first aid and communication capabilities. 2.2.1.  Applicable  C2  will  determine  if  an  in-theater  aircraft  other  than  a  fully  mission capable LC-130 is suitable. Consideration will be given to response time, carrying capacity and landing capabilities. 2.3.  Hostile  Environment  Kit  Use.  Use  of  the  hostile  environment  kit  requires  C2 authorization.  If  PIC  is  unable  to  communicate  with  the  C2  agents,  approval  authority  is delegated to the PIC. 2.4.  Crew  Duty  and  Crew  Rest  Limitations.  Comply  with  AFI  11-202V3  and  AFI  11-2C130V3 guidance. (T-2) 2.4.1.  Flight  Duty  Period  (FDP)  for  polar  operations  is  16  hours.  (T-3)  Open  Snow, reconnaissance and polar airdrop operations are restricted to the first 12 hours of FDP. (T-2) 2.4.2.  FDP  waiver  authority  to  recover  from  unplanned  mission  delays  is  delegated  to  the PIC during polar operations when communications with C2 cannot be established. 2.5.  Personal Requirements.  Refer to Attachment 2 and applicable theater annex.   6  AFI11-2C-130V3ADDD  22 JULY 2016 Chapter 3 PRE-FLIGHT / GROUND OPERATIONS 3.1.  Polar Landing Zones (PLZ). 3.1.1.  Ski Airfields. Ski airfields are groomed, skis only, landing zones, marked (flagged) as either Skiways or Ski Landing Areas (SLA) IAW AFI 13-217. Non-standard markings may be used with C2 concurrence. 3.1.2.  Open Snow. Open snow areas are generally unprepared, skis only, open-field landing areas  with  limited  or  no  markings.    Open  snow  areas  include  snow  fields,  glaciers  and floating  ice  sheets.  Due  to  lack  of  surface  preparation  and  airfield  markings,  open  snow operations present unique risk elements that must be mitigated. 3.1.3.  Ice  Runways.  Ice  runways,  prepared  for  wheeled  operations,  may  be  constructed  on compacted  snow,  glacial  ice  or  floating  ice  sheets.    Ice  runways  should  be  marked  in  the same manner as ski airfields. 3.1.4.  Mission  Folders.  109  OSS/OSK  will  provide  C2  and  aircrews  detailed  mission execution folders for all Polar Landing Zones. Folders will identify Risk Management (RM) considerations,  safe  areas  for  landing,  known  or  potential  crevasse  areas  as  well  as  other hazards. Mission Folders may be provided in hardcopy (paper) and/or a digital format (EFB). Reference AFI 11-2C-13 V3 Addendum D Annex D for additional information. 3.2.  Maximum  Aircraft  Gross  Weight.  Maximum  gross  weights  for  aircraft  operations  at specific  polar  landing  zones  are  established  by  C2  and  will  be  disseminated  by  Notices  to Airmen  (NOTAM)  or  Read  File  (T-3).  Following  operations  at  a  given  site,  the  PIC  should forward  recommendations  for  increase  or  decrease  in  maximum  aircraft  gross  weight  to  C2. Supervisors  of  Flying  (SOFs)  and  PICs  will  ensure  RM  sheets  reflect  the  increased  risk  of operations at higher gross weights (T-3).    NOTE: Consideration to potential changes to landing zone conditions should be reviewed prior to each mission. 3.2.1.  For  operations  at  ski  airfields,  the  initial  maximum  aircraft  gross  weight  is  125,000 lbs.    C2  may  authorize  a  higher  initial  aircraft  gross  weight  after  evaluation  of  surface conditions. 3.2.1.1.  Ski  operations  at  aircraft  gross  weights  above  135,000  lbs  will  only  be approved after LC-130 ground evaluation of the prepared surface. Exceptions to this will be identified by pre-season analysis and annotated in theater annex (T-3). 3.2.2.  Open snow ski operations are normally limited to a maximum aircraft gross weight of 118,000 lbs to 125,000 lbs based on surface conditions. 3.2.2.1.  Ski operations up to aircraft maximum gross weight limits specified in TO 1C- 130(L)H-1  will  only  be  considered  on  a  case  by  case  basis  after  LC-130  ground evaluation, RM and C2 approval (T-3). 3.2.3.  For  ice  runways,  maximum  aircraft  gross  weight  will  be  155,000  lbs  (T-1).    The maximum  aircraft  gross  weight  is  dependent  on  numerous  variables  such  as  ice  thickness, temperature, surface conditions and supporting substructure. Refer to AFI 13-217 Chapter 4, AFI11-2C-130V3ADDD  22 JULY 2016   7  applicable  Engineering  Technical  Letters  (ETL),  and  Ski  Landing  Area  Control  Officer (SLACO) documentation. Consider aircrew analysis of conditions when available. 3.3.  Cargo  Loading  and  Offload  Procedures.  Operations  on  skis  in  remote  areas  without material handling equipment (MHE) require the use of special on/offloading procedures and ski combat  offload  procedures.  Permanent  stations usually  have  a  prepared  cargo  loading  area  and MHE allowing normal procedures to be used. The following restrictions apply to all polar cargo operations: 3.3.1.  Normally,  engines  should  remain  running  for  all  on/offloads  at  other  than  staging locations.  However,  the  PIC  may  shut  down  engines  at  established  sites  when  deemed necessary for mission accomplishment, provided the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) is running before  shutdown  and  remains  running.  Engine  shutdown  during  extreme  cold  weather operations should be avoided. 3.3.2.  During open snow operations, all cargo restraints (chains, straps) will be left in place until  the  aircraft  has  come  to  a  stop  at  the  offload  area  and  clearance  to  offload  has  been received from the PIC; this is to prevent the possibility of a load breaking loose while taxiing (T-3). EXCEPTION: Ski Combat Offload. 3.3.3.  Ski  Combat  Offload.  The  ski  combat  offload  procedure  provides  a  means  of offloading single, multiple, married pallets, and Container Delivery System (CDS) containers without the use of MHE when operating on skis. 3.3.3.1.  Ski combat offloads are a core LC-130 tactic. At out camps, PICs are authorized to  use  ski  combat  offload  procedures  when  deemed  necessary  for  mission accomplishment.  When carrying sensitive cargo, user concurrence must be obtained (T-3).  At  permanent  sites,  PIC’s  will  coordinate  their  intention  to  combat  offload  with  the applicable C2. See TO 1C-130(L)H-1 for specific Ski Combat Offload procedures. 3.3.4.  Transport  of  Ice  Cores  (Cold-Deck  Operations).  Extreme  care  should  be  taken  to ensure  samples  are  transported  within  shipper  defined  parameters  to  the  maximum  extent possible.  The  viability  of  samples  can  be  destroyed  even  at  temperatures  below  freezing. Refer to AFI 11-2C-130 V3 Addendum D theater annex for specific procedures. 3.3.4.1.  Passengers  will  not  be  carried  on  flights  with  ice  cores  requiring  cold  deck procedures (T-3). Exceptions to this policy require additional RM and C2 approval. 3.4.  Remote Fueling and Concurrent Servicing Operations.  Remote fueling is the transfer of fuel  to  or  from  an  aircraft  or  ground  storage  system.  Concurrent  servicing  is  the  simultaneous servicing  of  fuel  with  either  passengers  on  board,  the  performance  of  minor  maintenance,  fleet servicing, or cargo on/offloading. 3.4.1.  Engines are normally left running due to the remote environment and lack of support. 3.4.2.  Remote fueling and concurrent servicing operations will be completed in accordance with AFI 11-2C-130V3, TO 00-25-172, refueling job guide and local procedures (T-2). Refer to 109 AW/139 AS Remote Fueling Operations Training Guide for further guidance. 3.5.  Assisted  Takeoff  (ATO)  Procedures.  C2  will  determine  the  need  for  ATO  based  on environmental  conditions  and  mission  requirements.  C2  will  pre-coordinate  ATO  requirements with maintenance. The aircraft will be parked on a designated ATO loading area or “hot spot” at the staging base for ATO mounting (T-3).   8  AFI11-2C-130V3ADDD  22 JULY 2016 3.5.1.  ATO bottles will be mounted on the aircraft prior to departure, unless waived by C2. Multiple sorties with ATO bottles mounted are permitted (T-3). 3.5.2.  If ATO bottles and/or igniters are carried inside the aircraft, they will be manifested in accordance with AFMAN 24-204(I) (T-2). 3.5.2.1.  The local fire department should be notified any time ATO will be mounted on the aircraft. 3.5.2.2.  109  AW  will  outline  ATO  operations  and  procedures  in  an  appropriate  Wing-level instruction or supplement to AFI 11-202V3. 3.6.  Extreme  Cold  Weather  Procedures.  The  LC-130  will  not  be  operated  in  temperatures below  its  operational  cold  weather  restriction  (minus  50°  C)  (T-3).  Aircrews  will  use  the station’s reported temperature; wind chill does not affect aircraft operating limitations. Waivers to  operate  at  temperatures  colder  than  –50°C  (-58°F)  will  only  be  considered  for  emergencies such as medical evacuation. These missions require additional planning, risk assessment and C2 approval.  NOTE:  The  temperature  restriction  is  based  on  mission  history,  maintenance considerations,  and  performance  limitations  of  AN-8  fuel  and  MIL-PRF-87257  hydraulic  fluid (Ref: TO1C-130(L)H-1 and TO 42B2-1-3). 3.6.1.  Material Handling Equipment (MHE). Aircrew will not normally on/offload cargo that requires MHE when surface contrails exist that obscure the visibility of the loading crew. 3.6.1.1.  When temperatures are at or below -45° C, C2 will factor surface obscuration in mission  planning  prior  to  scheduling  a  mission  requiring  MHE  (T-2).  If  a  mission  is released  under  these  circumstances,  the  PIC  and  loadmasters  will  assess  current conditions at the location to ensure necessary visibility for safe operations (T-1). 3.6.2.  Before  utilizing  Low  Speed  Ground  Idle  or  before  warming  the  aircraft  during extended stays/shutdowns at remote camps refer to the Flight Engineer FLIP, Extreme Cold Weather Procedures/Techniques section. AFI11-2C-130V3ADDD  22 JULY 2016   9  Chapter 4 FLIGHT OPERATIONS 4.1.  Taxi, Takeoff and Departure Restrictions. 4.1.1.  General.  Refer to AFI 11-2C-130V3 and theater annex for additional guidance. 4.1.2.  Taxi Operations. Crews should be cognizant of the combined effects of gross weight (GW), wind, and runway condition reading (RCR) to both wheel and ski taxi operations. For wheeled operations TO 1C-130(L)H-1 states the LC-130 is capable of taxiing in a 30 kt, 90 degree  wind  with  the  use  of  nose-wheel  steering  and  rudder.  These  numbers  are  based  on favorable  GW  and  RCR  conditions.    Lower  GW’s  and  RCR’s  are  less  favorable  variables.  Because the hazardous combination of wind, GW and RCR is difficult to judge, crews must thoroughly analyze current conditions to determine if it is safe to taxi the aircraft on wheels and/or skis. 4.1.2.1.  Aircraft  with  gross  weights  of  135,000  lbs  or  greater  will  taxi  on  prepared (groomed) surfaces to the maximum extent possible. Comply with TO 1C-130(L)H-1 taxi restrictions (T-2). 4.1.3.  Wind Restrictions. Ski takeoffs are prohibited when the surface wind (including gusts) exceeds 35 knots or the crosswind component exceeds 15 knots (T-2). 4.1.4.  Ski takeoffs will be conducted by a ski mission qualified aircraft commander (AC) in the left seat or a ski mission qualified instructor pilot in either seat (T-3). EXCEPTION: See Chapter 6. 4.1.5.  Night ski takeoffs require 109 AW/CC approval. 4.1.6.  ACs  will  not  depart  a  staging  base  to  a  remote  polar  site  without  an  operational  #1 (pilot’s) radar altimeter and APN-241 radar (T-3). 4.1.7.  On departure, the navigator will call passing 50, 100, 200, 300 and 400 feet AGL, or as briefed by the Pilot Flying (PF). 4.1.8.  Perform  a  detailed  terrain  study  and  review  of  engine  out  climb  performance.  If  an approved Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) departure procedure is not available, ACs will ensure ability  to  climb  in  Visual  Meteorological  Conditions  (VMC)  until  reaching  the  applicable Minimum  IFR  Altitude  (MIA)  (i.e.  base  of  Restricted  Operating  Zone  (ROZ),  Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) letdown corridor or enroute MIA) (T-2). 4.1.9.  For  departure  weather  minima  and  Visual  Flight  Rules  (VFR)/IFR  departure restrictions, reference paragraph 5.1 4.2.  Enroute Operations. 4.2.1.  Utilize published airways or theater approved Area Navigation (RNAV) routing to the maximum extent possible. 4.2.2.  To utilize unpublished routing, accomplish a thorough route study prior to departure to ensure safe terrain clearance.   10  AFI11-2C-130V3ADDD  22 JULY 2016 4.2.2.1.  When using unpublished IFR routing, calculate an enroute MIA that will provide 3,000 feet of terrain clearance within 22 nautical miles of center line (T-3). 4.2.3.  Do  not  operate  below  500  feet  Above  Ground  Level  (AGL)  unless  required  for mission accomplishment. 4.2.4.  All  published  courses  and  headings  are  polar  grid,  unless  otherwise  noted;  Self Contained  Navigation  System  (SCNS)  convergence  factor  should  be  verified  by  another pilot/navigator. 4.2.5.  Point of Safe Return (PSR). The PSR calculation determines the commit point beyond which return to the point of departure (or a suitable alternate) with the required overhead (or divert) fuel is no longer an option. Due to the austere nature of polar operations, aircrew will consider  their  alternate/divert  options  and  determine  a  PSR  when  mission  requirements dictate.  At  a  minimum  PSR  will  be  computed  whenever  an  Equal  Time  Point  (ETP)  is required.  See  Figure  4.1  for  PSR  calculations.  NOTE:  Amend  PSR  when  destination weather requires an alternate IAW AFI 11-202V3. Figure 4.1.  - PSR FORMULAS.  TAS – Planned True Airspeed (Long Range Cruise, usually 270 KIAS)  GS(Return)– Planned Ground Speed return (usually TAS plus the inverse of WF1) ½ Time – Half the amount of fuel available, converted to time, to take off from the departure point, fly to some point, and return to the planned return airfield with  the required overhead fuel remaining. In the no-wind situation ½ Time equals PSR Time. PSR – Estimated Time En-route (ETE) to a point where a safe return is assured. 4.3.  Descent and Arrival. AFI11-2C-130V3ADDD  22 JULY 2016   11  4.3.1.  Prior  to  descent,  the  AC  will  confirm  site  coordinates  and  theater  approved  RNAV routing  is  properly  entered  into  SCNS  and  independently  verified  by  another  pilot  or navigator (T-3). 4.3.2.  Prior to descent, the crew will attempt to establish two-way communications with the site  to  obtain  current  weather  conditions  and  traffic  information  (T-3).  See  paragraph  5.1 NOTE:  If  weather  reporting  capability  is  not  available,  the  PIC  is  the  final  authority  on determining if conditions are suitable for safe descent and landing. 4.3.3.  Crews will set the lowest forecast altimeter setting prior to descent through transition level when local altimeter setting is unavailable or unreliable (T-3). 4.3.4.  Temperature  extremes  may  require  corrections  to  minimum  altitudes.  Cold  weather temperature  corrections  will  be  applied  in  accordance  with  AFMAN  11-217V1,  AFI  11-202V3 and the FIH (T-2). 4.3.5.  Crews  will  avoid  descent  rates  in  excess  of  1,000  FPM,  airspeed  in  excess  of  230 KIAS  and  bank  angles  in  excess  of  30  degrees  when  within  3,000  feet  AGL  and  either  in IMC or over barren featureless terrain (T-2). 4.3.5.1.  Referencing the radar altimeter, the PM will state passing “3,000 feet” AGL (T-3). 4.3.5.2.  Descending  below  3,000  feet  AGL,  the  aircrew  should  compare  aircraft  true altitude (ground elevation + radar altimeter) to indicated pressure altitude for indications of  a  gross  error  in  local  altimeter  setting.  If  altimeter  setting  is  in  question,  consider  a Pressure Altimeter Update (Refer to paragraph 4.4.7). 4.3.6.  Descent below the enroute Minimum IFR Altitude in IMC is prohibited (T-1) unless: 4.3.6.1.  Descending via an IMC letdown procedure or, 4.3.6.2.  Established on a published instrument approach, 4.3.7.  IMC  Letdown  Procedures.  Landing  Zones  (LZ’s)  without  a  published  instrument approach may require a procedural IMC Letdown Corridor or use of a Restricted Operating Zone (ROZ). These procedures allow for a safe IMC descent from the enroute MIA to attain VMC.  IMC  letdown  procedures  and  associated  MIAs  will  be  developed  by  109  OSS/OSK IAW AFTTP 3-3.C-130H (T-3). 4.3.7.1.  IMC Letdown Corridor. An IMC letdown corridor allows an aircraft to operate safely below the minimum IFR enroute altitude. 4.3.7.1.1.  All  corridors  constructed  for  polar  operations  will  provide  a  minimum  of 1,000  feet  (2,000  feet  in  mountainous  terrain)  obstacle  clearance  within  5  Nautical Miles (NMs) of planned course (T-3). 4.3.7.1.2.  Corridors  will  include  an  Entry,  Decision,  Latest  Climb,  and  Exit  points (T-3). 4.3.7.2.  Restricted  Operating  Zone  (ROZ).  A  ROZ  is  typically  a  cylindrical  area  of protected airspace which allows an aircraft to “spiral down” to an altitude not lower than ROZ MSA. A ROZ will be placed for maximum utility and therefore, may not always be centered on a landing site or Objective Area (OA).   12  AFI11-2C-130V3ADDD  22 JULY 2016 4.3.7.2.1.  Polar  ROZ’s  will  provide  a  minimum  of  1,000  feet  (2,000  feet  in mountainous  terrain)  obstacle  clearance  within  5  NMs  of  the  defined  boundaries  of the ROZ (T-3). 4.3.7.3.  Crews will utilize all available navigational aids (e.g. SCNS, Low Power Color Radar (LPCR) and Moving Map) to ensure adequate terrain and obstacle clearance (T-3). Crews will perform a thorough review of terrain and obstacles, weather and aircraft climb performance before commencing a descent below the enroute MIA (T-3). 4.3.7.4.  If  use  of  an  IMC  letdown  procedure  does  not  allow  the  aircraft  to  attain  and maintain  VMC,  the  aircraft  should  remain  within  ROZ/Letdown  Corridor  protected airspace to climb back to the enroute MIA (T-2). 4.3.7.5.  An  IMC  Letdown  Procedure  can  be  used  to  position  aircraft  for  an  Airborne Radar Approach (ARA). 4.3.7.6.  109  OSS/OSK  will  develop  site  specific,  forecast  weather  minimums  for  use with IMC Letdown Procedures. These minima will be considered prior to departure from the staging base. 4.4.  Approach. 4.4.1.  If  unable  to  contact  ground  personnel,  all  approaches  (VFR  and  IFR)  should  be initiated  over  the  landing  threshold  or  open-snow  coordinates.  This  allows  the  aircrew  to verify coordinates, determine the altimeter setting, evaluate the weather conditions, alert site personnel and inspect the landing area prior to landing. All approaches shall be flown so as not to exceed stabilized approach criteria (T-2). 4.4.2.  For approach weather minima see paragraph 5.1. 4.4.3.  A  SCNS  LZ  should  be  programmed  and  briefed  for  all  landings.  Program  SCNS  to give  distance  remaining  to  the  LZ  threshold,  target  open  snow  coordinates  or  as  otherwise briefed. 4.4.4.  The PIC is responsible for maintaining separation of aircraft in uncontrolled airspace. The PIC will maintain a minimum 1,000 feet of vertical separation between aircraft until safe lateral separation is assured (T-3). 4.4.4.1.  Traffic  advisory  calls  will  be  made  over  Common  Traffic  Advisory  Frequency (CTAF)  in  uncontrolled  airspace  IAW  AFMAN  11-217V1&2  and  applicable  theater annex (T-3). 4.4.5.  Prior  to  crossing  the  intermediate  fix  (IF),  monitor  radar  altimeters  for  indications below 1,000 feet AGL. If in IMC and altimeter accuracy is in question, crews will perform a Pressure Altimeter Update (PAU) and continue to monitor the radar altimeter to touchdown (T-3). 4.4.6.  Stabilized  Approach  Criteria  (SAC).  During  all  ski  approaches,  the  aircraft  must  be stabilized on final approach and will be in the landing configuration before descending below 300  feet  AGL  (T-3).  An  aircraft  is  considered  stabilized  on  final  approach  when  it  is:  (1) aligned  with  the  extended  centerline,  (2)  no  more  than  10  degrees  of  bank  angle,  (3) established  on  a  normal  glide  path  and  (4)  within  5  knots  of  approach  speed.  With  the AFI11-2C-130V3ADDD  22 JULY 2016   13  exception  of  momentary  deviations,  a  go-around  or  missed  approach  will  be  accomplished any time the approach becomes unstable below 300 feet AGL (T-3). 4.4.7.  Pressure  Altimeter  Update  (PAU).  If  the  camp  reported  altimeter  setting  is  not available,  or  accuracy  is  in  question,  perform  a  PAU  before  starting  an  ARA.  The  PAU procedure will allow the crew to determine a safe barometric altimeter setting. For additional information,  reference  AFTTP  3-3.C-130H,  Pressure  Altimeter  Update  Using  the  Radar Altimeter section. 4.4.7.1.  PAU  Procedure.  The  PAU  is  conducted  over  a checkpoint  of  known  elevation, normally  the  threshold  of  a  landing  zone.  Descend  and  pass  over  the  PAU  checkpoint, referencing the radar altimeter, at the Radar Altimeter Check Altitude (RACA) published on  the  ARA  procedure.  NOTE:  Aircraft  is  normally  at  MSA  for  an  altimeter  update.  Published RACA is the difference between aircraft MSL altitude (MSA or as annotated) and ground elevation at a known checkpoint: 4.4.7.2.  RACA (AGL) = aircraft crossing altitude (MSL) – checkpoint elevation 4.4.7.2.1.  When  over  the  PAU  checkpoint,  the  pilot’s  barometric  altimeter  will  be adjusted  to  the  appropriate  barometric  altitude  (normally  MSA  published  on  ARA plates)  (T-3).  The copilot and navigator will adjust their respective altimeter setting to match the pilot’s (T-3). 4.4.7.2.2.  Once  an  updated  altimeter  setting  has  been  determined,  the  barometric altimeter will be referenced as the primary altitude reference for the remainder of the approach (T-3). The radar altimeter will continue to be crosschecked (T-3). 4.4.7.2.3.  After  performing  a  PAU,  crews  will  apply  temperature  correction  to procedure  altitudes  IAW  AFMAN  11-217V1,  AFI  11-202V3  and  the  Flight Information Handbook (FIH) (T-3). 4.4.7.3.  PAU is not required when: 4.4.7.3.1.  Weather conditions meet or exceed a ceiling of 1,500 feet and a visibility of 3 SMs (T-3). 4.4.7.3.2.  C2 approves; such approval will be disseminated by NOTAM and /or Read File. 4.4.7.3.3.  A  minimum  of  2  consecutive  LC-130  missions  to  the  site  confirming accurately  reported  altimeter  settings  are  required  prior  to  removing  the  PAU requirement  for  ARAs  in  IMC  (T-3).  Sites  not  requiring  a  PAU  for  initial  seasonal operations will be listed in AFI 11-2C-130V3 Addendum D and theater annex (T-3). If inaccurate altimeter setting reports are identified at any time, C2 will suspend non-PAU arrivals to the site and update NOTAMs and/or Read File as applicable. 4.4.8.  Ski  Airborne  Radar  Approaches  (ARA).  Ski  ARAs  are  instrument  approach procedures  designed  and  developed  by  109  OSS/OSK  TERPs  specialists  and  approved  by MAJCOM  TERPs  review.  MAJCOM  TERPs  reviewing  agency  determination  is  dependent on operational theater and the mission supported. 4.4.8.1.  The navigator will direct the ARA using aircraft radar as the primary means to position the aircraft (T-3).   14  AFI11-2C-130V3ADDD  22 JULY 2016 4.4.8.2.  The  navigator  will  direct  aircraft  heading  and  descent  profile  until  the  Pilot Monitoring (PM) acquires visual references to safely guide the PF to the landing zone (T-3). When there are sufficient ground references to take over the approach guidance, the PM  will  state  “copilot  (or  pilot)  has  the  approach”  (T-3).  The  PM  will  then  provide approach  guidance  to  the  PF  and  the  navigator  will  provide  drift  and  distance  to  the landing threshold while continuing to monitor the aircraft’s ground track (T-3). If the PM has  not  stated  “copilot  (or  pilot)  has  the  approach”  by  the  MAP,  the  navigator  will  call “go around” and the PF will execute the published missed approach (T-3). 4.4.8.3.  The PM will observe three sets of lead-in or skiway flags and the approach must meet Stabilized Approach Criteria (SAC) before stating “continue descent” (T-3). The PF may then descend no lower than 100 feet AGL (T-3). Before descending below 100 feet AGL, the PF will see the landing zone and state “pilot (or copilot) has the skiway (or ski landing area)” (T-3). Transfer of aircraft control to the landing pilot will be made stating “pilot (or copilot) has the aircraft” prior to descending below 100 feet AGL (T-3). 4.4.8.4.  If the PF cannot acquire the landing zone or the aircraft is not in a safe position to  land,  the  PF  will  execute  a  go  around  (T-2).    On  climb-out,  the  navigator  will  call passing 50, 100, 200, 300 and 400 feet AGL, or as briefed by the PF. 4.4.8.5.  For weather minima see paragraph 5.1 4.5.  Landing Restrictions. 4.5.1.  Navigator will call passing 300, 200, 100, 50, 25 and 10 feet AGL, or as briefed by the PF. 4.5.2.  Wind  Restrictions.  Ski  landings  are  prohibited  when  the  surface  wind  (including gusts) exceeds 35 knots or the crosswind component exceeds 15 knots (T-2). 4.5.3.  Ski  landings  will  be  conducted  by  a  ski  mission  qualified  aircraft  commander  in  the left  seat  or  a  ski  mission  qualified  instructor  pilot  in  either  seat  (T-3).  EXCEPTION:  See Chapter 5. 4.5.4.  Night ski landings require 109 AW/CC approval. 4.5.5.  Practice or actual minimum run ski landings require 109 OG/CC approval. 4.5.6.  Anytime  the  aircraft  is  stopped  after  a  ski  landing,  the  flight  engineer  will  visually inspect the skis. The PIC may waive this requirement. 4.5.7.  For landing weather minima restrictions, reference paragraph 5.1 4.6.  Ski  ARA  Flyability  Check  and  Airfield  Marking  (Skiway)  Certification.  In-Theater evaluation  of  a  Ski  ARA  consists  of  a  flyability  check  of  the  ARA  procedure  (when  required) and a marking certification to confirm skiway marking is IAW AFI 13-217. 4.6.1.  Flyability Check. A flyability check will consist of a flight to verify that the approach provides suitable obstacle and terrain clearance, confirm procedure headings and alignment, review procedure complexity and evaluate flight deck workload (T-3). 4.6.1.1.  109  OSS/OSK  will  identify  procedures  requiring  flight  check  as  part  of  the planning  process  and  will  annotate  this  requirement  on  the  Pre-  Season  Site  Analysis Checklist.  Flight  check  will  be  only  accomplished  for  new  ARA  procedures  where  an AFI11-2C-130V3ADDD  22 JULY 2016   15  Instrument Approach has not previously existed or in cases where the procedure has been significantly modified (T-3). 4.6.1.2.  Flyability Checks will be performed with weather at or above a ceiling of 1500 ft. and visibility of 3 miles (T-3). All segments of the procedure should be flown in VMC to the maximum extent possible. 4.6.1.3.  Crews  will  evaluate  the  radar  presentation  and  ensure  that  flagging,  obstacles and terrain are clearly discernible (T-3). Annotate clutter, camp layout and abnormalities. Crews will document procedure compliance or discrepancies on Skiway / SLA Marking Certification and ARA Flyability Check (T-3). 4.6.2.  Airfield  Marking  Certification.  Airfield  marking  certification  will  ensure  that  each skiway  complies  with  minimum  flagging  requirements  IAW  AFI  13-217  and  that  flags  are visible  from  the  air,  both  visually  and  on  radar  (T-3).  Certification  is  independent  for  each skiway direction and will include a review of both lead-in flags and skiway flags for a given direction of flight (T-3). 4.6.2.1.  All  seasonal  skiways  require  an  airfield  marking  certification  unless  otherwise identified in theater annex (T-3). 4.6.2.2.  Until  skiway  markings  are  certified,  ARA  weather  minimums  will  be  not  less than 1000 feet and 3 miles (T-3). 4.6.2.3.  Surface  grooming  conditions  should  be  noted,  but  are  not  required  for certification.  Grooming  status  will  affect  maximum  aircraft  gross  weight  restrictions only. See paragraph 3.2 4.6.2.4.  When authorized by C2, certification of airfield markings IAW AFI 13-217 may be performed by ground personnel. 4.6.2.5.  Crews  will  document  certification  or  discrepancies  on  Skiway  /  SLA  Marking Certification and ARA Flyability Check (T-3). 4.7.  Emergency  Landing  Procedures.  It  may  become  necessary  to  execute  an  emergency landing  or  land  in  a  non-surveyed  area.  Use  all  available  resources  to  locate  the  most  suitable site. Reference Annex A, and theater annex for additional guidance. 4.7.1.  When in the vicinity of an established site, confer with ground personnel to determine a safe landing location that presents the fewest known ground hazards. 4.8.  Airdrop Procedures (Polar  Airdrop).  The nature and operational restrictions inherent in polar  airdrop  environments  impose  a  number  of  significant  challenges  not  encountered  in traditional  airdrop  employment.  The  use  of  austere,  flexible  drop  zones,  potential  lack  of  DZ personnel, minimum weather services and poor terrain/obstacle data are some of the challenges. Extensive pre-mission objective area planning, user coordination and potential collateral damage assessment is essential to mission success; reference AFTTP 3-3.C-130H, Airdrop Methods and Techniques section. 4.8.1.  Airdrop  in  a  polar  environment  should  normally  be  executed  in  VMC.  Non-Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS), IMC “coordinate only” airdrops require C2 approval and a theater specific waiver to AFI 11-2C-130V3 restrictions (T-2).   16  AFI11-2C-130V3ADDD  22 JULY 2016 4.8.2.  Ski ARA procedures combined with Mission Computer Airdrop techniques provide a stable platform and accurate means of positioning the aircraft. When no discernible ground features  exist  (e.g.  camp,  cache,  vehicle  or  terrain  feature)  the  box  pattern  may  be  omitted and the airdrop conducted over fixed coordinates. See Figure 4.2 4.8.3.  109 OSS/OSK will provide aircrew with a mission folder for airdrop missions (T-3). If  a  mission  folder  is  not  available,  a  thorough  mission  plan  will  be  formulated  prior  to departure and approved by appropriate C2 (T-3). 4.8.4.  For  airdrops  where  cabin  pressure  altitude  is  expected  to  exceed  10,000  feet  MSL, Medium/High Altitude qualified aircrews, procedures and equipment will be used (T-2). 4.8.5.  Minimum  equipment  for  polar  airdrop  will  include  an  operational  APN-241  LPCR, SCNS and #1(pilot’s) radar altimeter (T-3). 4.8.6.  C2  will  determine  requirement  for  additional  crewmembers  (i.e.  extra  navigator, loadmaster). Figure 4.2.  Typical Polar Airdrop Profile.  AFI11-2C-130V3ADDD  22 JULY 2016   17  Chapter 5 WEATHER 5.1.  Weather Minima. 5.1.1.  General.  In  addition  to  AFI  11-202V3  and  AFI  11-2C130V3  restrictions,  reference applicable  theater  annex  for  theater  specific  weather  requirements.  109  OSS/OSK  will  set higher  weather  minimums  when  required  for  safety  (T-3).  Changes  to  109  OSS/OSK established weather minimums require C2 approval and will be published by NOTAM/Read File (T-3). 5.1.2.  Departure.  Do  not  depart  a  Polar  Landing  Zone  when  visibility  is  less  than  ½  SM (800M);  the  PIC  may  use  airfield  flagging  as  an  aid  in  determining  visibility  (T-1).  If departing  a  site  with  weather  less  than  return  approach  minimums,  a  departure  alternate  is required. When departing an open snow site, crews will ensure ability to climb in VMC until reaching the applicable MIA (T-1). 5.1.2.1.  VFR  Departure.  Maintain  VMC  and  obtain  an  IFR  clearance  prior  to  entering controlled airspace (T-2). 5.1.2.2.  IFR  Departure.  Obtain  IFR  clearance  prior  to  takeoff.  If  unable,  the  PIC  may depart  under  IFR  in  Class  G  airspace  in  IMC;  however,  an  approved  IFR  departure method  is  still  required  (T-2).  The  PIC  is  responsible  for  maintaining  traffic  and terrain/obstruction  clearance.  Obtain  an  IFR  clearance  prior  to  entering  controlled airspace (T-2). 5.1.3.  Descent.  If  not  established  on  a  segment  of  an  IFR  approach,  do  not  descend  below the  applicable  MIA  (Enroute,  ROZ,  or  Letdown  Corridor)  unless  able  to  remain  in  VMC until landing (T-2). 5.1.3.1.  Due to visual limitations and illusions, descent below 1,000 feet AGL to a VMC only destination is not recommended unless the landing area is in sight. Surface/Horizon conditions should be considered prior to descent. 5.1.4.  Approach & Landing. 5.1.4.1.  MAJCOM approved ARA  – As published, will not be less than 300 feet and 1 mile (T-1). 5.1.4.2.  IFR Visual Approach/VFR arrival – will not be less than 1500 feet and 3 miles (T-1). 5.1.4.3.  Open  snow  landings  -  VMC  below  the  MIA  and  Surface/Horizon  condition  of Fair/Fair (T-1). 5.2.  Surface  and  Horizon  Condition  Definitions.  Surface  and  horizon  condition  values  are determined  and  reported  by  an  observer  on  the  surface  or  determined  by  the  aircrew  when  no observer is present (i.e. initial put-in). They are intended for pilot advisory information and are not limiting, except where listed in other parts of this chapter. 5.2.1.  Surface Definition Values.   18  AFI11-2C-130V3ADDD  22 JULY 2016 5.2.1.1.  Good: Snow features such as sastrugi, drifts and gullies are easily identified by shadow. The sun is usually un-obscured. 5.2.1.2.  Fair:  Snow  surface  features  can  be  identified  by  contrast,  but  no  definite shadows exist. The sun is usually partially to near totally obscured. 5.2.1.3.  Poor:  Snow  surface  features  cannot  be  readily  identified  except  from  close  up. The sun is usually totally obscured. 5.2.1.4.  Nil:  Snow  surface  features  cannot  be  identified.  No  shadows  or  contrast  exist. Dark  objects  appear  to  float  in  the  air.  Although  the  overcast  may  exhibit  considerable glare,  the  sun  is  totally  obscured.  Due  to  surface  reflection,  the  glare  appears  to  be equally bright in all directions. 5.2.2.  Horizon Definition Values. 5.2.2.1.  Good: The horizon is sharply defined by sky and snow contrast. 5.2.2.2.  Fair: The horizon may be identified although the contrast between sky and snow surface is not sharply defined. 5.2.2.3.  Poor: The horizon is barely discernible. 5.2.2.4.  Nil: Total loss of horizon definition. The snow and sky surfaces appear to merge. AFI11-2C-130V3ADDD  22 JULY 2016   19  Chapter 6 TRAINING RESTRICTIONS 6.1.  Training Restrictions. 6.1.1.  Practice no-flap ski landings are prohibited (T-3). 6.1.2.  Touch  and  Go  ski  landings  are  prohibited.
