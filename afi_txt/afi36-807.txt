OVERTIME, COMPENSATORY TIME, AND CREDIT HOURS  (New)  5.1. Overtime.   (New)  5.1.1. Overtime is hours of work that are ordered or approved by management (and for FLSA covered employees also includes work that is “suffered or permitted”).  All overtime work should be ordered and approved in advance and is normally applicable to special projects or peak workloads pursuant to mission needs.  It is not applicable to day‐to‐day routine assignments.  Anyone directed to work overtime must be compensated. (T-0)  (New) 5.1.1.1. If an employee works a Regular Tour of Duty or flexible work schedule, then overtime work is in excess of 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in an administrative workweek.  (New)  5.1.1.2. If an employee works a compressed work schedule, then overtime work is in excess of the basic work requirement for the compressed work schedule.  (New)  5.1.3. Supervisors must not permit employees to work extra hours that are not ordered or approved. (T-0)  Such work, when performed by FLSA non-exempt employees with the supervisor’s mere knowledge or reasonable belief that the work was performed, is compensable ‘suffered or permitted’ overtime work and non-exempt employees must be paid through overtime pay or compensatory time. (T-0)   (New)  5.1.4. Supervisors should attempt to limit the use of overtime and leave in the same pay period when appropriate and review employee annual leave documents prior to assigning overtime.  (New)  5.1.5. When considering use of overtime, supervisors are expected to: (New)  5.1.5.1. Clearly identify and articulate to the employee the work that needs to be performed during the overtime;  (New)  5.1.5.2. Identify why overtime is necessary and why the work cannot be performed during the normal workday; Chapter 2 Chapter 5      AFI36-807_AFGM2017-01  22 March 2017 Scheduling of Work, Holiday Observances, and Overtime   (New)  5.1.5.3. Clarify that other options such as changing work schedules or rescheduling leave were considered and determined not to be appropriate; and  (New)  5.1.5.4. Not require overtime to perform regular work or work that could be performed during regular work hours absent compelling reasons.  (New)  5.1.6. Supervisors will release employees from overtime if additional work would impair health, efficiency or cause extreme hardship. (T-3) Such release may be required as a reasonable accommodation for a disability.  (New)  5.1.7. Senior Executive Service (SES) and Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service (DISES) employees are excluded from earning overtime.  (New) 5.2. Overtime Approval.  (New)  5.2.1. The AF Form 428, to include the justification statement, must be completed prior to working the overtime by the supervisor. (T-3)  (New)  5.2.1.1. The justification statement includes the following:  (New)  5.2.1.1.1. The specific tasks to be accomplished;  (New)  5.2.1.1.2. The reason(s) tasks could not be completed during regular work hours;  (New)  5.2.1.1.3. An acknowledgement that other options were considered and found not to be appropriate prior to allowing overtime and annual leave in the same pay period, if applicable.   (New)  5.2.2. Before working or ordering overtime, supervisors must obtain approval from their overtime authorizing official. (T-1) EXCEPTION: Only in an emergency may the supervisor order overtime without prior authorization.  The supervisor must document the overtime no later than the following workday. (T-3)  (New)  5.2.2.1. For working capital fund employees, include separation of duties and ensure certification requirements are met; complete AF Form 428 located in the JOCAS II and DMAPS-TAA.  (New)  5.2.3. When an overtime requirement conflicts with an employee's religious obligations or practices supervisors should consider changing tours of duty involving the assignment of overtime by permitting the employee to perform the overtime on another day or to excuse him or her from the overtime assignment. (T-3) EXCEPTION: If failure to perform the overtime will prevent accomplishment of the mission, the employee is expected to perform the overtime. Any decision regarding what legally constitutes “preventing mission accomplishment” and justifies not granting a religious accommodation should be made in conjunction with the local Staff Judge Advocate (SJA).  (Replace)  5.8.6. Compensatory time off for travel should be used within 26 pay periods from the date it was credited IAW 5 CFR 550.1407(a). Unused compensatory time off for travel is forfeited  AFI36-807_AFGM2017-01  22 March 2017 Scheduling of Work, Holiday Observances, and Overtime  if not used by the end of the expiration period. Unused compensatory time off for travel is forfeited when an employee transfers to an agency outside of the Department of Defense or separates from federal service prior to the expiration period. Unused compensatory time off for travel is forfeited upon movement to a non-covered position. Payment for compensatory time off for travel is prohibited. Use of the AF Form 428 to document travel compensatory time is not necessary.                         BY ORDER OF THE  SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 36-807 25 AUGUST 2015 Personnel SCHEDULING OF WORK, HOLIDAY OBSERVANCES, AND OVERTIME  COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY ACCESSIBILITY:  Publications and forms are available on the e-Publishing website at www.e-publishing.af.mil for downloading or ordering.

The  Air  Force  relies  on  a  large  civilian  workforce  to  accomplish  its  mission.  There  is  a mutual  employee-management  responsibility  to  plan  and  schedule  work  to  meet  mission requirements. 1.2.  The  Air  Force  will  administer  work  schedules  and  overtime  without  unlawful discrimination  because  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex  (including  pregnancy),  national  origin,  age (40 or older), disability, genetic information, or prior EEO activity. 1.3. The  Air  Force  is  committed  to  collaborative  labor-management  relationships  and  will adhere  to  the  provisions  of  collective  bargaining  agreements  (CBA).  Refer  to  applicable  CBA for  local  procedures  for  administering  work  schedules  and  overtime  for  bargaining  unit employees. Contact the servicing Civilian Personnel Section (CPS) for guidance or questions. 1.4.  The  Fair  Labor  Standards  Act  (FLSA)  prescribes  standards  for  wages  and  overtime pay for certain types of employment.  The Air Force will comply with provisions of the FLSA. AFI36-807  25 AUGUST 2015   5  Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Tours of Duty. 3.1.1.  Tours of Duty.  A 40-hour basic workweek scheduled Monday through  Friday where the hours of a day and the days of a workweek constitute an employee’s regularly scheduled administrative workweek. 3.1.2.  Uncommon  Tour  of  Duty.  Any  40-hour  basic  workweek  scheduled  to  include Saturday and/or Sunday, or one that is scheduled for four workdays or less but no more than six  days  of  the  administrative  workweek.  An  uncommon  tour  of  duty  may  be  established when necessary for efficient operations or when  the cost  of operations can thus  be reduced without imposing undue hardship on employees. 3.1.3.  Tours  of  Duty  for  Educational  Purposes.  Special  tours  of  duty  of  not  less  than  40 hours  may  be  established  by  the  supervisor  for  off  duty  educational  purposes  to  permit  an employee  to  take  one  or  more  courses,  related  to  current  and  anticipated  needs  of  the  Air Force, in a college, university, or other educational institution. 3.1.3.1.  Courses taken by the employee are not training under chapter 41 of title 5 U.S.C. 3.1.3.2.  The rearrangement of the employee’s tour of duty will not appreciably interfere with the accomplishment of the mission of the position. 3.1.3.3.  Employees  cannot  be paid  premium  pay  solely because the  rescheduling of the tour of duty causes them to work on a day, or during the hours of a day, when premium pay would otherwise be required. 3.1.3.4.  Supervisors  may  assign  an  employee  to  a  regularly  scheduled  shift  requiring premium  pay,  for  example,  night  pay  IAW  this  authority,  since  no  additional  costs  are incurred. 3.1.3.5.  Supervisors  must  ensure  appropriate  time  and  attendance  accounting  and notification is made when an employee is assigned to or changed from a special tour of duty to prevent inadvertent payment of premium pay. (T-3) 3.1.4.  Standby Duty.   An employee is  on duty,  and time spent on standby duty is  hours of work (compensable) if, for work-related reasons, the employee is restricted by official order to a designated post of duty and is assigned to be in a state of readiness to perform work with limitations on the employee's activities so substantial that the employee cannot use the time effectively  for  his  or  her  own  purposes.  A  finding  that  an  employee's  activities  are substantially limited may not be based on the fact that an employee is subject to restrictions necessary  to  ensure  that  the  employee  will  be  able  to  perform  his  or  her  duties  and responsibilities, such as restrictions on alcohol consumption or use of certain nonprescription medications. 3.1.4.1.  An  employee  is  not  considered  restricted  for  “work-related  reasons”  if,  for example,  the  employee  remains  at  the  post  of  duty  voluntarily,  or  if  the  restriction  is  a natural result of geographic isolation or the fact that the employee resides on the agency's premises. For example, in the case of an employee assigned to work in a remote area or AFI36-807  25 AUGUST 2015   9  on a ship, the fact that the employee has limited mobility when relieved from duty would not  be  a  basis  for  finding  that  the  employee  is  restricted  for  work-related  reasons.  Deviations from this tour should be kept to a minimum. 3.1.5.  On-Call Status.  An employee will be considered off duty and time spent in an on-call status shall not be considered hours of work (compensable) if: 3.1.5.1.  The employee is allowed to  leave a telephone number or to  carry  an  electronic device  for  the  purpose  of  being  contacted,  even  though  the  employee  is  required  to remain within a reasonable call-back radius; or 3.1.5.2.  The employee is allowed to make arrangements such that any work which may arise during the on-call period will be performed by another person. 3.2.  Scheduling Work. 3.2.1.  The  work  of  employees  will  be  scheduled  to  accomplish  the  mission  of  the organization and will correspond with the employee’s actual work requirements. (T-3) 3.2.2.  Distributing Work Schedules. Copies of work schedules for uncommon tours of duty will be distributed in the work area or to employees (e.g., by email, posting paper copy) and will include the names of the assigned employees. (T-2) 3.2.3.  Scheduling  Rest  Periods.  For  FLSA  non-exempt  employees,  schedule  short  rest periods,  not  exceeding  15  minutes  during  each  four  hours  of  continuous  work,  when  the employee  is  not  able  to  leave  the  work  site  as  needed  and  the  supervisor  believes  the  rest periods will be of benefit to the service and mission. Criteria in determining the justification for granting or directing rest periods are: 3.2.3.1.  Protection  of  employee's  health  by  relieving  them  from  hazardous  or  very physical work. 3.2.3.2.  Reduce the accident rate by removing the fatigue potential. 3.2.3.3.  Relieve those who work in confined spaces. 3.2.3.4.  Increasing or maintaining a high quality or quantity production. 3.2.4.  Scheduling  of  Lunch  Periods.  Scheduled  lunch  (or  other  meal)  periods  are  not considered duty time for which compensation is paid.  Lunch periods normally range from 30 minutes  to  1  hour.    The  employee  is  entirely  free  of  the  duties  of  their  position  during  the lunch period. 3.2.4.1.  Lunch  periods  should  not  be  scheduled  to  delay  the  start  of  the  workday  or shorten the workday. 3.2.4.2.  Lunch periods should be scheduled when more than one shift is in operation. 3.2.4.3.  On-the-job lunch periods. When supervisors schedule more than one 8-hour shift in  a  24-hour  period  and  an  overlapping  of  shifts  to  permit  time  off  for  lunch  is  not possible,  supervisors  may  authorize  an  on-the-job  lunch  period  of  20  minutes  or  less. When  employees  are  required  to  spend  their  on-the-job  lunch  period  at  or  near  their workstations under these conditions, the time covered by the 20 minute on-the-job lunch period is compensable.   10  AFI36-807  25 AUGUST 2015 3.2.4.4.  Employees given duty free lunch periods during periods of overtime work do not receive compensation for that time. 3.2.5.  Break  Time  for  Nursing  Mothers.    Provide  a  reasonable  break  time  for  nursing mothers to express breast milk for up to 1 year after the child’s birth. (T-0) 3.2.5.1.  The  frequency  of  breaks  as  well  as  the  duration  of  each  break  will  vary according to the needs of the individual employee. 3.2.5.2.  Organizations may, but are not required to, compensate the employee for breaks taken under this provision. 3.2.5.2.1.  An  exempt  employee  who  uses  the  organization-provided  compensated break period (see paragraph 3.2.3.) to express milk must be compensated in the same manner as other employees for the break period.  (T-0) 3.2.5.2.2.  An employee who is not provided a compensated break  must be allowed to  use  current  workplace  flexibilities  to  provide  reasonable  break  time  (i.e.,  work schedule  adjustments,  earned  credit  hours  or  compensatory  time,  annual  leave,  or leave without pay (LWOP). (T-0) 3.2.5.3.  Suitable  Space  for  Nursing  Mothers.    Organizations  must  provide  a  suitable place which may be used by the employee to express milk, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free of intrusion from coworkers and the public. (T-2) 3.2.6.  Scheduling  Make  Ready  and  Clean-Up  Time.  Incidental  duties  that  are  directly connected  with  the  performance  of  a  job,  (i.e.,  obtaining  and  replacing  working  tools  or materials,  undergoing  inspections),  are  considered  part  of  the  job  requirements  within  the employee's established tour of duty. 3.2.6.1.  Arrange  work  shifts  so  time  required  for  incidental  duties  will  be  part  of  the regular workday. (T-3) 3.2.6.2.  When  incidental  duties  cannot  be  part  of  the  regularly  scheduled  workday,  the extra time will not exceed 30 minutes a day. (T-3)  Overtime or compensatory time may be  authorized  and  approved  to  be  paid  when  time  spent  performing  incidental  duties exceeds 10 minutes. AFI36-807  25 AUGUST 2015   11  Chapter 4 WORK SCHEDULES 4.1.  Alternative Work Schedule (AWS). 4.1.1.  AWS  Policy.  Alternative  work  schedules  offer  employees  a  measure  of  personal control  over  their  work  hours  which  allows  employees  to  accomplish  work,  personal,  and family  responsibilities  (e.g.  educational  programs,  wellness  programs,  volunteer  work,  or dependent care).  This privilege is accompanied by a high degree of personal responsibility.  Maximum cooperation between employees and their supervisors must be exhibited to ensure participation in an AWS does not result in an adverse impact on the command or function of the  employee’s  office.  (T-3)  The  paramount  consideration  in  allowing  AWS  shall  be  the maintenance of a balanced work force, ensuring a mix of both numbers and skills, to provide effective  and  efficient  accomplishment  of  the  mission,  including  timely  responses  to emergency situations. 4.1.2.  Use of AWS. Organizations are to adopt a policy permitting AWS, as long as doing so does  not  interfere  with  mission  accomplishment.    AWS  includes  both  flexible  work schedules  and  compressed  work  schedules.        Employee  participation  in  AWS,  when established, is voluntary.  Each employee will have an established arrival and departure time. (T-3) 4.1.2.1.  Employees  with  a  disability  may  be  approved  AWS  as  a  reasonable accommodation. 4.1.3.  Approval  of  AWS.  An  AWS  may  not  be  appropriate  for  all  positions  (e.g.  requiring customer interface, availability during core hours or other mission demands). Managers and supervisors  are  required  to  maintain  sufficient  mission/program  coverage  at  all  times. Employees must request and obtain supervisory approval prior to working an AWS. (T-3) 4.2.  Compressed Work Schedule (CWS):  A CWS provides for an employee to complete their biweekly basic work hours’ requirement in fewer workdays than a Regular Tour of Duty. 4.2.1.  Examples of CWSs may include “5/4-9 compressed plan” and the “4-10 compressed plan.” 4.2.2.  The regular day off (RDO) for an employee on a CWS is a fixed day(s) of each pay period that the employee is not scheduled to work.  Employees on an RDO are not in a pay or leave status. 4.2.3.  The employee should establish arrival and departure time. 4.3.  Flexible Work Schedule (FWS).  A FWS provides employees the option to select and vary their arrival and departure time within the established limits, (e.g., core hours) set by the AWS approving official. 4.3.1.  Under  FWS,  an  employee’s  work  day  typically  begins  between  0600  and  0900  and ends  between  1500  and  1800;  Core  hours  are  normally  0900  to  1500,  Monday  through Friday. The employee has the option to select the starting and quitting times within the limits established by AWS approving official  (e.g. 0700 to 1600 or 0830 to 1730). Lunch periods normally range from 30 minutes to 1 hour.   12  AFI36-807  25 AUGUST 2015 4.3.2.  Examples  of  FWSs  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  flexitour,  gliding  schedule, maxiflex schedule, variable day schedule, or variable week schedule. 4.4.  Terminating  AWS.  AWS  may  be  terminated  due  to  an  adverse  agency  impact  or  due  to mission needs and workload. 4.4.1.  When  operational  priorities  require  a  change  in  an  AWS  schedule,  supervisors  will normally give one (1) pay period advance notice. (T-3) Exceptions may be made for unusual circumstances  such  as  short  notice  special  projects,  military  action,  natural  disaster,  TDY, training, furlough, etc. 4.4.2.  Participation in  AWS may be discontinued at  any time by the supervisor if there are any  concerns  regarding  performance,  misconduct  or  in  response  to  changing  work conditions. 4.4.3.  Employees will be provided written notification stating the reason for termination of AWS. (T-3) 4.4.4.  Supervisors  must  adhere  to  applicable  labor  management  agreements  prior  to terminating an AWS schedule for bargaining unit employees. (T-0) AFI36-807  25 AUGUST 2015   13  Chapter 5 OVERTIME, COMPENSATORY TIME, AND CREDIT HOURS 5.1.  Overtime. 5.1.1.  Overtime  is  hours  of  work  that  are  ordered  or  approved  by  management  (and  for FLSA covered employees also includes work that is “suffered or permitted”).  All overtime work  should  be  ordered  and  approved  in  advance  and  is  normally  applicable  to  special projects or peak workloads pursuant to mission needs.  It is not applicable to day‐  to‐ day routine assignments.  Anyone directed to work overtime must be compensated. (T-0) 5.1.1.1.  If  an  employee  works  a  Regular  Tour  of  Duty  or  flexible  work  schedule,  then overtime  work  is  in  excess  of  8  hours  in  a  day  or  40  hours  in  an  administrative workweek. 5.1.1.2.  If  an  employee  works  a  compressed  work  schedule,  then  overtime  work  is  in excess of the basic work requirement for the compressed work schedule. 5.1.2.  Only when the mission requires should the supervisor or appropriate level commander establish tours of duty which require the payment of premium pay (e.g., night work, Sunday work, overtime, and holiday). 5.1.3.  Supervisors  must  not  permit  employees  to  work  extra  hours  that  are  not  ordered  or approved.  (T-0)    Such  work,  when  performed  by  FLSA  non-exempt  employees  with  the supervisor’s  mere  knowledge  or  reasonable  belief  that  the  work  was  performed,  is compensable ‘suffered or permitted’ overtime work and non-exempt employees must be paid through overtime pay or compensatory time. (T-0)  5.1.4.  Supervisors  will  release  employees  from  overtime  if  additional  work  would  impair health,  efficiency  or  cause  extreme  hardship.  (T-3)  Such  release  may  be  required  as  a reasonable accommodation for a disability. 5.1.5. Senior  Executive  Service  (SES)  and  Defense  Intelligence  Senior  Executive  Service (DISES) employees are excluded from earning overtime. 5.2.  Overtime Approval. 5.2.1.  Before  ordering  overtime,  supervisors  must  obtain  approval  from  their  overtime authorizing  official.  (T-1)  EXCEPTION:  Only  in  an  emergency  may  the  supervisor  order overtime  without  prior  authorization.    The  supervisor  must  document  the  overtime  no  later than the following workday. (T-3) 5.2.2.  When  an  overtime  requirement  conflicts  with  an  employee's  religious  obligations  or practices  supervisors  should  consider  changing  tours  of  duty  involving  the  assignment  of overtime  by  permitting  the  employee  to  perform  the  overtime  on  another  day  or  to  excuse him  or  her  from  the  overtime  assignment.  (T-3)  EXCEPTION:  If  failure  to  perform  the overtime will prevent  accomplishment  of the mission, the employee is  expected to  perform the  overtime.  Any  decision  regarding  what  legally  constitutes  “preventing  mission accomplishment”  and  justifies  not  granting  a  religious  accommodation  should  be  made  in conjunction with the local Staff Judge Advocate (SJA).   14  AFI36-807  25 AUGUST 2015 5.3.  Overtime Hours of Work for Travel. 5.3.1.  Travel time is considered hours of work for nonexempt FLSA employees only when: 5.3.1.1.  The  travel  involves  the  performance  of  actual  work  while  traveling  (e.g.,  is required to drive a vehicle, or perform other work, while traveling.) 5.3.1.2.  The employee is required to travel as a passenger on a one-day assignment away from the duty station. 5.3.1.3.  The  employee  is  required  to  travel  as  a  passenger  on  an  overnight  assignment away  from  the  duty  station  during  hours  on  non-workdays  that  correspond  to  the employee’s regular working hours. 5.3.2.  Travel  time  is  considered  hours  of  work  for  most  exempt  FLSA  employees  if  the travel is ordered or approved, and meets one of the following conditions. 5.3.2.1.  The travel involves the performance of actual work while traveling (e.g., motor vehicle operator is required to drive a loaded truck; pilot an airplane.) 5.3.2.2.  The  travel  is  incident  to  travel  that  involves  the  performance  of  work  while traveling (e.g., is required to drive an empty truck back to the point of origin.) 5.3.2.3.  The  travel  occurs  under  arduous  and  unusual  conditions  (e.g.,  travel  is  under extremely severe weather conditions.) 5.3.2.4.  The travel results from an event that could not be scheduled or administratively controlled (e.g., a job-related court appearance required by a court subpoena.) 5.3.3.  Do  not  adjust  an  employee’s  normal  regularly  scheduled  administrative  workweek solely to include travel hours that would not otherwise be considered hours of work. 5.4.  Overtime Hours of Work for Training. 5.4.1.  Time spent in training outside of regular duty hours are considered hours of work and are compensable. 5.4.2.  The  fact  alone  that  the  Air  Force  funds  all  or  part  of  the  training  expenses  does  not establish an entitlement for overtime pay for hours of work.  The Air Force must also have directed participation in the training. (T-3) 5.5.  Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime (AUO). 5.5.1.  Employees may be eligible to receive premium pay for AUO on an annual basis.  The supervisor must demonstrate the need exists to pay AUO and document the AUO request in writing. (T-2) 5.5.2.  AUO  requests  are  initiated  by  the  supervisor  through  the  chain  of  command  and through the MAJCOM/COCOM to AF/A1CP for AUO approval.  Requests should include: 5.5.2.1.  Position title, pay plan, occupational series, and grade or level of the position. 5.5.2.2.  A copy of the Core Personnel Document (CPD).  Include a detailed description of the duties and responsibilities of the position that address the specific requirement for overtime, what is expected, and why adjustments to the workweek or other administrative controls are insufficient to accommodate the overtime need. AFI36-807  25 AUGUST 2015   15  5.5.2.3.  Justification  for  payment  of  AUO.    Include  actions  management  has  taken  to control the requirement for AUO.  Explain the nature of the work which prevents hours of  duty  from  being  controlled  administratively;  the  necessity  for  the  employee  being generally  responsible for recognizing,  without supervision, circumstances which require remaining  on  duty;  and  the  pertinent  conditions  such  as  frequency  and  duration  of  the irregular or occasional overtime work required. 5.5.2.4.  Requests for AUO for positions in Services must contain a brief explanation why effective scheduling of the employee under the organizational structure cannot eliminate the  need  for  AUO.  (T-2)  Requests  must  be  coordinated  through  the  installation's respective  MAJCOM/A1  or  equivalent  and  Services  Director  or  equivalent  prior  to submission to HQ USAF/A1CP. (T-2) 5.6.  Maximum Earnings Limitations on Overtime 5.6.1.  General Schedule (GS) and other covered employees may receive overtime premium pay for a biweekly pay period only to the extent that the sum of basic pay and premium pay for  the  pay  period  does  not  exceed  the  greater  of  the  biweekly  rate  payable  for  the  GS-15, step  10  (including  any  applicable  locality  payment  or  special  rate  supplement),  or  the  rate payable for level V of the Executive Schedule. 5.6.2.  In certain emergency or mission critical situations, the Major Command (MAJCOM), Combatant Command (COCOM), Field Operating Agency (FOA), and Direct Reporting Unit (DRU)  Commanders  and  Directors  may  apply  an  annual  premium  pay  cap  instead  of  a biweekly premium pay cap. 5.6.3.  Under  5  U.S.C.  5547  the  premium  pay  cap  provisions  may  be  waived  for  certain employees  working  overseas.    (T-3)  There  is  no  other  authority  under  law  to  waive  the annual premium pay limitation. (T-0) 5.6.4.  When the biweekly (or annual, if applicable) cap on premium pay is reached, exempt employees  may  still  be  ordered  to  perform  overtime  work  without  receiving  further compensation. 5.7.  Compensatory Time. 5.7.1.  Non-exempt  employees  must  not  be  directed  to  receive  compensatory  time  for overtime  worked  instead  of  receiving  overtime  pay.    (T-2)    The  following  categories  of employees  must  be  allowed  the  choice  of  being  compensated  by  either  overtime  pay  or compensatory  time:  1)  FLSA  non-exempt  employees;  2)  prevailing  rate  (federal  wage system) employees, even if FLSA exempt; 3) FLSA exempt employees whose rate of basic pay is equal to or less than the rate for GS-10, step 10. (T-2)  Management may require that FLSA  exempt  employees  whose  basic  pay  exceeds  the  maximum  rate  for  GS-10  receive compensatory time for overtime worked instead of receiving overtime pay. 5.7.2.  Management may require that FLSA exempt employees whose basic pay exceeds the maximum  rate  for  GS-10  receive  compensatory  time  for  overtime  worked  instead  of receiving overtime pay. 5.7.3.  Obtain approval prior to ordering compensatory time on AF Form 428. 5.7.4.  Employees  should  use  previously  earned  compensatory  time  before  using  accrued annual leave.   16  AFI36-807  25 AUGUST 2015 5.7.5.  Senior Executive Service (SES) and Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service (DISES) employees are excluded from earning compensatory time. 5.8.  Compensatory Time for Travel. 5.8.1.  Employees  who  perform  officially  authorized  travel  must  be  credited  compensatory time off for authorized time in a travel status. (T-0) Travel time is not otherwise compensable hours of work. Compensatory time off for travel  is credited and used in increments of one-quarter of an hour (15 minutes). 5.8.2.  Supervisors should ensure employees schedule temporary duty (TDY) travel within an employee's regularly scheduled tour of duty to the maximum extent possible and consistent with  mission  requirements.  Only  where  this  is  not  practicable  will  the  employee  earn compensatory time for travel. 5.8.3.  Senior  Executive  Service  (SES)  and  Defense  Intelligence  Senior  Executive  Service (DISES) employees are excluded from earning compensatory time off for travel. 5.8.4.  Supervisors  or  managers  authorized  to  direct  travel  and/or  approve  time  and attendance may approve requests for compensatory time off for travel. 5.8.5.  Supervisors may require employees requesting compensatory time for travel to submit documentation in support of the request. 5.8.5.1.  Time spent in an official travel status includes: 5.8.5.1.1.  Time spent traveling between the official duty station and a temporary duty station or between two temporary duty stations. 5.8.5.1.2.  Time  spent  traveling  outside  of  regular  working  hours  between  the employee’s home and the temporary duty station or a transportation terminal that is outside the limits of their official duty station.  The employee’s normal home-to-work and work-to-home commuting time must be deducted. (T-1) 5.8.5.1.3.  The  "usual  waiting  time"  preceding  or  interrupting  such  travel  (e.g., waiting  at  the  airport  or  train  station  prior  to  departure).    An  "extended"  waiting period-i.e., an unusually long wait during which the employee is free to rest, sleep, or otherwise use the time for his or her own purposes-is not considered time in a travel status. 5.8.5.2.  Meal periods are not creditable travel time.  For every eight and one-half (8 ½) hours of compensatory time for travel claimed, ½ hour must be deducted as a bona fide meal  period.  (T-1)  EXCEPTION:  In  a  situation  where  the  employee  is  continuously traveling in a conveyance (aircraft, train, automobile) the deduction does not apply. 5.8.6.  Compensatory time off for travel should be used within 26 pay periods from the date it was credited IAW 5 CFR 550.1407(a).  Unused compensatory time off for travel is forfeited if not used by the end of the expiration period.  Unused compensatory time off for travel is forfeited  when  an  employee  transfers  to  another  agency  (outside  of  Air  Force)  or  separates from federal service prior to the expiration period.  Unused compensatory time off for travel is  forfeited  upon  movement  to  a  non-covered  position.  Payment  for  compensatory  time  off for travel is prohibited. Use of the AF Form 428 to document travel compensatory time is not necessary. AFI36-807  25 AUGUST 2015   17    5.9.  Credit Hours. 5.9.1.  Credit  hours  are  non-overtime  hours  an  employee  on  a  FWS  voluntarily  requests  to work  in  excess  of  their  basic  work  requirement  (e.g.,  8  hours  a  day)  during  flexible  hours (e.g., Mon-Fri 0600-0900 and 1500-1800 and Sat or Sun 0600-1800) so as to vary the length of a workday or workweek.  Only employees on FWSs may elect to work credit hours, with supervisor  approval,  or  IAW  labor  agreements  permittance,  in  excess  of  the  basic  work requirements. Employees on a CWS are not eligible for credit hours. 5.9.2.  A full-time employee may carry up to 24 credit hours over to the next pay period.  For a  part-time  employee,  only  the  hours  in  the  employee’s  biweekly  basic  work  requirement may be carried over to the next pay period. 5.9.3.  Credit  hours  are  paid  out  at  the  employee’s  current  rate  of  pay  only  if  Federal employment  ends,if  the  employee  is  no  longer  subject  to  a  FWS  (e.g.,  changes  to  a compressed work schedule) or the employee transfers to another agency. 5.9.4.  Credit hours are generally not earned during lunch, on days when leave (annual, sick, credit  hours,  compensatory  time,  time-off  award)  or  excused  absence  is  used.    Employees must  obtain  verbal  approval  from  their  supervisor  prior  to  working  credit  hours  on  a  non-workday.  (T-3) Supervisors will consider the amount  of leave taken, if any, during the pay period, prior to approving a request for credit hours on a non-workday. 5.9.5.  GS  employees,  wage  employees,  senior  level  or  scientific  professional  employees (SL/ST)  under  flexible  work  schedules  may  be  permitted  to  earn  credit  hours.  Members  of the  Senior  Executive  Service  (SES)  and  Defense  Intelligence  Senior  Executive  Service (DISES) may not earn credit hours.   18  AFI36-807  25 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 6 HOLIDAY OBSERVANCES 6.1.  Holidays.  Federal  law  (5  U.S.C.  6103)  establishes  the  public  holidays  for  Federal employees.  Holidays may also be established by Executive Order. 6.1.1.  Most employees work a Monday through Friday tour of duty so that when a holiday falls on a Saturday, the holiday usually is observed on Friday;  or when a holiday falls on a Sunday, the holiday usually is observed on Monday. 6.1.2.  Duration of a Holiday. The full 24 hours of a calendar day are normally considered as the duration of a holiday. 6.1.2.1.  When an employee's regular workday begins  on a holiday and extends into  the next calendar day, the entire shift is considered as a holiday to determine the employee's entitlement to holiday premium pay or time off for observance of the holiday. 6.1.2.2.  When  an  employee's  regularly  scheduled  tour  of  duty  includes  two  shifts beginning  on  a  holiday,  the  first  shift  is  considered  as  a  holiday  to  determine  holiday benefits. 6.2.  Holiday Work.  Employees assigned to positions where scheduled holiday work is required are entitled to pay at their rate of basic pay plus holiday premium pay. 6.2.1.  Supervisors must not require employees, assigned to positions where holiday work is not  scheduled  or  required,  to  work  on  holidays  or  days  designated  as  observed  holidays, unless  the  work  is  justified  by  unusual  circumstances  or  the  maintenance  of  usual  essential services is involved. (T-3) 6.2.2.  Supervisors may order holiday work when required and have it approved in writing by an  official  designated  to  authorize  holiday  work;  approval  must  be  obtained  in  advance before work is performed, except in cases of an emergency, because it constitutes authority for expenditure of funds and certification that funds are available to pay the employee. (T-3) Supervisors ordering work on a holiday or employees required to remain on duty during an emergency  will  not  require  advance  approval  for  the  work  but  must  document  the  holiday work no later than the following workday. (T-3) 6.2.3.  Supervisors  record  the  reasons  for  the  holiday  work  and  the  hours  worked  by  the employees and necessary approvals on AF Form 428. EXCEPTION: This requirement does not  apply  to  employees  engaged  in  essential  services  such  as  firefighters,  police,  hospital employees, or other service personnel whose tours of duty includes scheduled holiday work. 6.3.  Observed Day. 6.3.1.  When  a  holiday  falls  on  a  regularly  scheduled  workday,  observe  that  day  as  the holiday. 6.3.2.  When  employees  with  a  40-hour  basic  workweek  and  an  uncommon  tour  of  duty  of other  than  Monday  through  Friday  have  a  holiday  that  falls  on  a  Sunday,  observe  the  next regularly scheduled workday as the holiday. AFI36-807  25 AUGUST 2015   19  6.3.3.  When  employees  with  a  40-hour  basic  workweek  and  an  uncommon  tour  of  duty  of other  than  Monday  through  Friday  have  a  holiday  that  falls  on  their  non-workday,  observe the next regularly scheduled workday as a holiday. 6.3.4.  For employees with an uncommon tour of duty, when a holiday (designated observed day)  falls  on  an  employee's  non-workday  (Monday  through  Saturday),  the  workday immediately preceding the day is observed as the holiday. 6.4.  Compressed Work Schedule 6.4.1.  When full-time employees on a CWS are relieved (e.g. absences  of less than 1 hour excused  by  the  supervisor)  or  prevented  (e.g.  inclement  weather)  from  working  on  a  day designated  as  a  holiday,  they  are  entitled  to  basic  pay  for  the  number  of  hours  they  are regularly scheduled to work on that day. 6.4.2.  When a holiday falls on the regularly scheduled day off of the employee’s compressed work schedule and: 6.4.2.1.  Is  a  Sunday,  the  employee's  in  lieu  of  holiday  is  the  first  regularly  scheduled workday following the Sunday holiday; or 6.4.2.2.  Is not a Sunday; the employee's in lieu of holiday is the last regularly scheduled workday preceding the holiday. 6.4.3.  If  the  President  issues  an  Executive  order  granting  a  "half-day"  holiday,  a  full-time employee  on  a  compressed  work  schedule  is  entitled  to  basic  pay  for  half  the  number  of hours he or she would otherwise work on that day. 6.5.  Flexible Work Schedule. 6.5.1.  Holiday  observances  for  employees  who  work  a  flexible  schedule  are  the  same  as those for full-time employees with a regularly scheduled 40-hour basic workweek. 6.5.2.  A full-time employee on a flexible work schedule is only entitled to 8 hours of pay on a holiday when the employee does not work. (See 5 U.S.C. 6124.)  Full-time employees on flexible  schedules  under  which  employees  work  more  than  8  hours  a  day  must  make arrangements to work extra hours during other regularly scheduled workdays (or take annual leave or use credit hours or compensatory time off) in order to fulfill the 80-hour biweekly work requirement. (T-3) 6.5.3.  If  the  President  issues  an  Executive  order  granting  a  "half-day"  holiday,  a  full-time employee on a flexible work schedule is credited with half the number of hours he or she was scheduled to work, not to exceed 4 hours. 6.6.  Part Time Employee. 6.6.1.  When  a  holiday  falls  on  a  part-time  employee's  regularly  scheduled  workday,  the employee is entitled to be excused with pay for the number of hours he or she is scheduled to work on the actual day of the holiday. 6.6.2.  When a holiday falls on a part-time employee's non-workday, and that day is observed by full-time employees, the employee is not entitled to the holiday.   20  AFI36-807  25 AUGUST 2015 6.6.3.  When a part-time employee is on a flexible work schedule and is relieved or prevented from working on a day designated as a holiday, the employee is entitled to receive basic pay for the number of hours the employee would have worked on that holiday up to eight hours. 6.6.4.  When  a  part-time  employee  is  on  a  compressed  work  schedule  and  is  relieved  or prevented  from  working  on  a  day  within  the  employee's  scheduled  tour  of  duty  that  is designated as a holiday, the employee is entitled to basic pay for the number of hours of the compressed work schedule on that day. 6.6.5.  When a part-time employee is on a compressed work schedule and a holiday falls on a non-workday, the employee is not entitled to an "in-lieu-of" day for that holiday. 6.6.6.  If  full-time  employees  observe  an  "in-lieu-of"  day  instead  of  the  actual  holiday  and that  "in-lieu-of"  day  falls  within  a  part-time  employee's  work  schedule,  the  part-time employee will not get that day off with pay. 6.6.7.  When  a  holiday  is  observed  by  full-time  employees  on  a  day  within  the  part-time employee's  regularly  scheduled  workweek  and  the  part-time  employee  is  prevented  (e.g. inclement weather) from working that day, the employee is entitled to the day off with pay for the number of hours he or she is regularly scheduled to work on that day. 6.7.  Holidays and Annual Premium Pay. 6.7.1.  The  use  of  administrative  leave  is  not  appropriate  for  employees  receiving  annual premium pay under 5 USC 5545(c)(1) and 5 CFR Parts 410, 550, and 551. These employees who are absent on holidays, which occur within their regular tours of duty, must be charged leave for those absences. (T-3)They are not entitled to holiday time off because they receive a type of premium pay that includes pay for holidays. 6.7.2.  When such an employee is scheduled to work on a holiday and is granted the day off for personal reasons, the employee will take leave (e.g., annual leave, earned compensatory time off, LWOP, sick leave.) 6.8.  Religious  Observance.  There  are  no  official  observances  of  religious  holidays  outside  of established federal holidays. 6.8.1.  Consider adjustments to CWS or FWS to allow for religious observances. 6.8.2.  Except  in  situations  of  potential  mission  failure,  requests  to  take  leave  for  religious observances should be granted (e.g., annual leave, earned compensatory time off, LWOP). 6.8.3.  An  employee  may  request  to  work  compensatory  time  for  the  purpose  of  earning compensatory time off for religious observances.   Compensatory time may be worked prior to or after the taking of the compensatory time off.  The employee must request and receive approval  to  use  the  compensatory  time  off.  (T-3)  To  the  extent  that  such  modifications  in work  schedules  do  not  interfere  with  the  efficient  accomplishment  of  the  mission,  in  each instance the employee shall be afforded the opportunity to work compensatory overtime and shall in each instance be granted compensatory time off for religious observances when the employee’s  personal  religious  beliefs  require  that  the  employee  abstain  from  work  during certain periods of the workday or workweek.  AFI36-807  25 AUGUST 2015   21  6.9.  State  and  Local  Holidays.  State  and  local  holidays,  including  local  holidays  in  foreign areas,  are  treated  as  regular  workdays.  Employees  working  on  such  a  day  receive  only  their regular pay and are not entitled to holiday premium pay.  See AFI 36-815, Absence and Leave, when all or part of the activity is closed by administrative order.  DANIEL R.

Administrative  Workweek—Administrative  workweek  begins  at  0001  Sunday  and  ends  at 2400 on the next following Saturday.  The calendar day on which a shift begins is considered the day of duty for that day even though the day of duty extends into the next calendar day or into the following administrative workweek. Administratively  Uncontrollable  Overtime—--Work  in  a  job  that  unpredictably  requires substantial  amounts  of  irregular  or  occasional  overtime,  and  in  which  the  employees  generally are responsible for recognizing, without supervision, circumstances that require them to remain on duty.

For the flexible work schedule programs,  time off with  pay  in  lieu of overtime pay for regularly scheduled or irregular or occasional overtime work. Compressed  Work  Schedule  (CWS)—Compressed  work  schedule  is  when  a  full-time employee, an 80-hour biweekly basic work requirement, is scheduled in less than 10 workdays. In the case of a part-time employee, it is a biweekly basic work requirement of less than 80 hours that is scheduled in less than 10 workdays. Core hours—Time periods during the workday, workweek, or pay period within the tour of duty during  which  an  employee  covered  by  a  flexible  work  schedule  is  required  to  be  present  for work.

First 40-Hours—First 40 hours of duty performed within a period of no more than six days of the administrative workweek may be established as the basic workweek when it is impractical to prescribe a regular schedule of definite hours of duty each workday. Flexible  Hours—Times  during  the  workday,  workweek,  or  pay  period  within  the  tour  of  duty during which an employee covered by a flexible work schedule may choose to vary their times of arrival  to  and  departure  from  the  work  site  consistent  with  the  duties  and  requirements  of  the position. Flexible  Work  Schedule—Consists  of  workdays  with  flexible  hours  in  which  employees provide  mission  coverage.

Flexible  work  schedules  enable employees to select and alter their work schedules to better fit personal needs and help balance work,  personal,  and  family  responsibilities.    Limits  are  set  by  installation  level  approving officials for AWS. Flexitour—A  type  of  FWS  in  which  an  employee  is  allowed  to  select  starting  and  stopping times within the flexible hours.  Once selected, the hours are fixed until the agency provides an opportunity to select different starting and stopping times Gliding schedule—A type of FWS in which a full-time employee has a basic work requirement of 8 hours in each day and 40 hours in each week, may select a starting and stopping time each day, and may change starting and stopping times daily within the flexible hours. Holiday Work—Non-overtime work performed during a regularly scheduled daily tour of duty on a legal holiday or the day observed as a holiday. Intermittent—Work which is done on an irregular basis because it is not feasible to establish a prearranged (regularly scheduled) tour of duty.

Irregular shifts may or may not involve uncommon tours. AFI36-807  25 AUGUST 2015   25  Maxiflex Schedule—A type of FWS that contains core hours on fewer than 10 workdays in the biweekly pay period and in which a full-time employee has a basic work requirement of 80 hours for the biweekly pay period, but may vary the number of hours worked on a given workday or the number of hours each week within the limits established for the organization. Night  Differential—Regular  scheduled  work  that  is  performed  at  night.  This  generally  means work  scheduled  before  the  beginning  of  the  administrative  workweek.  Overtime  hours  do  not count toward an employee's entitlement to receive a night shift differential Night Work—Work performed between the hours of 1800 and 0600 the following day. Observed  Day—Holiday  in  which  employees  are  given  paid  time  off  on  a  day  other  than  the date in which the holiday actually occurs. Overtime  Work—Hours  of  work  that  are  officially  ordered  in  advance  and  in  excess  of  eight hours in a day or 40 hours in a week. NOTE: Overtime work for compressed work schedules is all hours in excess of the established compressed work schedule. Part Time—In some circumstances, it is not possible to obtain or use an employee's service for the full 40-hour workweek. Part time tours of duty may be authorized when service on a regular, repetitive  basis  is  required  at  least  one  day  during  each  administrative  workweek.  However, additional service may be required during the remainder of the administrative workweek.

Standard Day Shifts—Standard day shifts begin between 0600 and 0900. Standard  Graveyard  Shifts—Graveyard  shifts  commencing  at  0000  hours  begin  the  day  for work  scheduling  purposes  and  for  determining  the  holiday  or  the  day  observed  in  lieu  of  the holiday. Suffer  or  Permit  to  Work—  For  a  non-exempt  employee,  the  standard  under  which  an employee may become eligible for overtime pay.  Time spent doing work not requested by the employer, but still allowed by it, is generally deemed hours worked, since the employer knows or has  reason  to  believe  that  the  employee  is  continuing  to  work  and  the  employer  is  benefiting from the work being done.  Supervisors and managers are required not to suffer or permit their employees to work overtime hours without proper approval. Sunday Work—Regular scheduled tour of duty within a basic workweek when any part of that work is performed on Sunday. Tour  of  Duty—Hours  of  a  day  and  the  days  of  an  administrative  workweek  that  constitute  an employee’s regularly scheduled administrative workweek.   26  AFI36-807  25 AUGUST 2015 Uncommon Tour of Duty—Any 40-hour basic workweek scheduled to include Saturday and or Sunday, for four workdays or less but  not  more than six days of the  administrative workweek. An uncommon tour of duty may be established when necessary for efficient operations or when the cost of operations can thus be reduced without imposing undue hardship on employees. Usual  Waiting  Time—The  period  of  time  a  traveler  is  required  to  arrive  at  a  transportation terminal  prior  to  departure  time  or  the  intervening  time  spent  between  transportation,  (i.e., between  connecting  flights,  waiting  for  bus  transportation).    When  there  is  an  unusually  long wait between actual periods of travel during which the employee is free to rest, sleep, or use the time for their own purposes, the extended waiting period is not creditable time in a travel status. Variable  Day  Schedule—A type of  FWS  containing core hours on each workday in  the week and in which a full-time employee has a basic work requirement of 40 hours in each week of the biweekly pay period, but may vary the number of hours worked on a given workday within the week within the limits established for the organization. Variable  Week  Schedule—A  type  of  FWS  containing  core  hours  on  each  workday  in  the biweekly pay period and in which a full-time employee has a basic work requirement of 80 hours for the biweekly pay period, but may vary the number of hours worked on a given workday or the number of hours each week within the limits established for the organization.
