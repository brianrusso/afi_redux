Mortuary  Services  Entitlements.  Members  who  retire  from  the  Air  Force  retain  certain mortuary  services  entitlements.  Recognizing  your  long  and  faithful  military  service,  the  Air Force extends mortuary  services  entitlements to  you within the extent possible as permitted by law. 2.  Entitlements Administered and Extended by the Air Force. 2.1.  Remains  Transportation. 2.1.1.  You are eligible for the transportation entitlement listed in paragraph 2.1.2 if you die while properly admitted to  a military medical facility of the armed forces  (excludes Veterans  Administration  hospitals)  in  the  United  States,  to  include  Alaska,  Hawaii,  the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other territories and possessions of the United States. 2.1.1.1.  “Properly  admitted”  means  you  are  placed  under  treatment  or  observation and you are provided room, board, and continuous nursing service in the area of the hospital where patients stay at least overnight. 2.1.1.2.  If  you  die  in  the  emergency  room  without  being  properly  admitted,  no eligibility exists. 2.1.1.3.  Deaths  occurring  in  Veterans  Administration  hospital  after  being  properly admitted  may  be  eligible  for  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  Death  Benefit entitlements. 2.1.2.  Transportation provided under this section may not be to a place further from the place  of  death  than  the  decedent’s  last  place  of  permanent  residence,  and  any  amount paid under this section may not exceed the cost of transportation from the place of death to the decedent’s last place of permanent residence. 2.1.2.1.  If  the  place  of  burial  is  further  distant  than  your  last  place  of  permanent residence  the  Air  Force  can  pay  no  more  than  the  cost  to  transport  your  remains  to your  last  place  of  permanent  residence.  For  example,  you  live  in  Orlando,  Florida, and are visiting Biloxi, Mississippi. You become ill and are properly admitted to the Air Force Hospital, Keesler AFB, Mississippi, and subsequently die. You are entitled to  transportation  of  your  remains  back  to  Orlando,  Florida.  However,  if  your  NOK wants to bury you in Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia, the Air Force could pay no  more  than  what  it  would  have  cost  to  return  your  remains  to  Orlando,  Florida (your permanent address). 2.2.  Authorized Transportation Expenses. 2.2.1.  Removal  of  remains  from  place  of  death  or  where  remains  are  released  by authorities  to  a  funeral  home  selected  by  your  NOK  for  preparation,  dressing,  and casketing. AFPAM34-505  16 FEBRUARY 2016 3 2.2.2.  An outer shipping container to protect casket if transportation is by commercial air or rail. 2.2.3.  Delivery of remains from the funeral home to a nearby airport or rail station. 2.2.4.  Cost of commercial air carrier or train. The movement of your remains by military aircraft in the United States is prohibited by law. 2.2.5.  Delivery  of  remains  from  the  airport  or  rail  station  at  destination  to  the  funeral home selected by your NOK. 2.2.6.  Delivery of remains from the destination funeral home to the cemetery. 2.3.  Military Funeral Honors. 2.3.1.  The Air Force may provide military honors at your place of burial provided: 2.3.1.1.  Your NOK or funeral director requests such honors by contacting the Honor Guard  office  at  the  nearest  active  Air  Force  base  at  least  48  hours  prior  to  the scheduled time/date of burial. 2.3.1.2.  There  is  sufficient  time  allotted  to  transition  a  funeral  honors  detail  to  the place  of  burial.  Remember,  the  nearest  servicing  Air  Force  base  may  be  several hundred miles away. 2.3.1.3.  Rendering  the  desired  honors  will  not  interfere  with  the  execution  of  the base’s primary mission. 2.3.2.  In accordance with DoDI 1300.15, paragraph 5.3.5.1., military funeral honors will be  performed  by  at  least  a  two-person  detail.    Military  funeral  honors  will  include  flag folding  and  presentation  and  the  playing  of  Taps.    NOTE:    Other  elements,  such  as pallbearers, firing party, live bugler, color guard, Air Force chaplain may be provided, if resources are available.   2.3.2.1.  Whether  the  requested  elements  are  provided  depends  on  the  capability  of the base on the day requested. 2.3.3.  Flyover.  If  you  served  as  a  3-star  or  4-star  general  officer  or  as  Chief  Master Sergeant of the Air Force, or were awarded the Medal of Honor, Air Force Cross, Army Distinguished  Service  Cross,  or  Navy  Cross,  achieved  at  least  one  or  more  officially recognized aerial victories, or were a Prisoner of War; your closest NOK may request a flyover at the place of burial. The performance of a flyover depends on the availability of tactical aircraft at the given time and date, minimum weather requirements, and approvals for the required air space. 2.4.  Interment  in  the  USAF  Academy  Cemetery,  Colorado  Springs,  Colorado.  You,  your spouse,  and  dependent  unmarried  children  under  21  years  of  age  may  be  interred  in  the USAF Academy Cemetery provided you are a: 2.4.1.  Graduate of the USAF Academy. 2.4.2.  US Air Force general or lieutenant general. 2.4.3.

The VA forms and pamphlets discussed in the following paragraphs may be obtained from the nearest VA office. 3.1.  National  Cemetery.  You  may  be  interred  in  a  national  cemetery,  most  of  which  are operated  by  the  VA,  while  Arlington  National  Cemetery  is  operated  by  Department  of  the Army. 3.1.1.  All  retirees,  their  spouses,  and  unmarried  children  under  21  years  of  age  are eligible for burial in national cemeteries, including Arlington. 3.1.2.

Government  Headstone.  A  government  furnished  headstone  may  be  obtained  to  mark your  grave.  There  are  different  styles  and  types  of  headstones  and  certain  cemetery requirements that must be met. All details concerning these headstones may be found in VA Form  40-1330, Application for  Standard Government Headstone or Marker for  Installation in a Private or Local Cemetery. 3.3.  Burial  Allowance.  Your  NOK  may  receive  a  small  burial  allowance  from  the  VA.

You  are  entitled  to  one  interment  flag  to  drape  your  casket,  with ultimate presentation to your NOK. This flag is furnished by the VA, not the Air Force. The funeral director handling your arrangements and conducting your funeral obtains this flag by completing  a  prescribed  VA  form.

If  your NOK  wants to  take advantage of some or all entitlements when  you die, he or she should do the following: 4.1.1.  Transportation:    If  eligible  for  transportation  entitlements  in  accordance  with sections 2.1. and 2.2., contact the Force Support Squadron mortuary officer at the closest Air Force base for assistance.  The mortuary officer will obtain a signed statement from your  NOK  listing  the  funeral  home(s)  selected  and  place  of  burial  and  will  coordinate with the funeral home for billing. 4.1.2.  Military  Funeral  Honors:    Request  military  funeral  honors  through  your  selected funeral  home.        Provide  the  funeral  director  the  DD  214  or  retirement  order.    If  your funeral director cannot assist you, you can contact your closest Force Support Squadron mortuary officer or Honor Guard office to arrange for military funeral honors.    AFPAM34-505  16 FEBRUARY 2016 5 4.1.3.  Provide  the  funeral  home  the  DD  214  or  retirement  orders.      The  document substantiates your status as a retiree for Air Force entitlements and enables your NOK to obtain  VA  benefits  such  as  interment  in  a  national  cemetery,  headstone,  interment  flag, etc. 4.1.4.  Your  NOK  will  be  responsible  for  paying  any  funeral  home  and  cemetery expenses they incur. 5.  Future Planning.
