WR—Western Range Terms Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS).—The ALCS provides a survivable Command and Control  (C2)  capability  for  launch  of  MM  III  ICBMs.    The  ALCS  is  capable  of  injecting preparatory  launch,  enable,  and  execute  launch  commands  directly  to  the  launch  facility/ies [LF(s)] to achieve launch.  It also has the ability to inject inhibit launch commands to prevent an unauthorized launch.  The platform also serves as a communication relay for emergency action messages (EAMs).  The ALCS should not be confused with the US Navy (USN) E-6B Mercury Strategic  Command  Airborne  Command  Post  aircraft  that  the  system  is  hosted  on.    The  E-6B aircraft  serves  in  multiple  roles  to  perform  the  USSTRATCOM  nuclear  mission.    The  ALCS capability is one of the resident systems configured on the E-6B that provides survivable C2 of the  MM  III.    The  aircraft  is  owned  and  operated  by  the  USN  (as  TF-124),  but  the  ALCS equipment is owned by the AF, and is operated by MCC-As from the 625th Strategic Operation   16  AFI13-530  8 SEPTEMBER 2015 Squadron (STOS)  and Joint Functional Component Command-Global Strike (JFCC-GS) J317 in executing USSTRATCOM missions.  USSTRATCOM maintains operational control (OPCON) and  tactical  control  (TACON)  of  the  E-6B,  while  administrative  control  (ADCON)  is administered by the respective services, USN and AF. Codes.—Codes provide positive control and nuclear surety for the MM  III weapon system and ALCS.  Codes protect information used to target, enable, and launch an ICBM.  This includes the encryption/decryption of critical status communications between the Launch Control Centers and LFs  and  supports  the  secondary  execution  capability  of  the  ALCS.    All  functions  use  National Security  Administration  produced  crypto-variables  controlled  through  both  environment  design and procedural safeguards to ensure no lone individual can gain access to a complete squadron launch or enable code. Deterrence.—The  prevention  of  action  by  the  existence  of  a  credible  threat  of  unacceptable counteraction and/or belief that the cost of action outweighs the perceived benefits.  (JP 1-02) Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (MM III ICBM).—The LGM-30G MM III ICBM is an offensive, three-stage strategic missile capable of delivering reentry vehicles (RVs) to  independent,  pre-selected  targets.    Key  characteristics  of  the  weapon  system  are  rapid execution, high accuracy, low vulnerability, and a high in-commission/on-alert rate.  The missile is  approximately  60  feet  long,  5.5  feet  in  diameter,  and  weighs  approximately  80,000  pounds.  Each  missile  is  equipped  with  an  onboard  guidance  computer  system  capable  of  transitioning from  day-to-day  ground  functions  to  an  operational  flight  control  mode.    The  MM  III  ICBM weapon system is currently in the operations and support phase of the acquisition process and is in the sustainment phase of the weapon system’s life cycle. Operational Test & Evaluation (OT&E).—Testing and evaluation conducted in as realistic an operational  environment  as  possible the  prospective  system's  operational effectiveness, suitability, and operational capabilities.  In addition, OT&E provides information on  organization,  personnel  requirements,  doctrine,  and  tactics.    It  may  also  provide  data  to support or verify material in operating instructions, publications, and handbooks. to  estimate Western Range (WR).—Headquartered at Vandenberg AFB CA, the 30th Space Wing conducts spacelift,  missile  test  and  other  test  and  evaluation  operations  from  the  WR  on  California’s central  coast.    The  WR  supports  southern  trajectory  space  launches  capable  of  achieving  polar orbits  and  western  launching  ICBM  test  launches.    The  WR  also  supports  USN  Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile and Missile Defense Agency tests.  AFI13-530  8 SEPTEMBER 2015   17  Attachment 2 TABLE A2.1.
