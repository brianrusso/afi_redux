It explains  how  much  leave  employees  earn,  when  and  under  what  conditions  employees  are granted  annual  leave,  sick  leave,  leave  without  pay,  and  other  specialized  forms  of  leave  and absence.  The  instruction  outlines  how  to  determine  if  a  specific  type  of  absence  is  charged  to leave,  excused  without  charge  to  leave,  or  considered  official  duty.

Air  Force  Policy.  The  Air  Force  Policy  Directive 36-8,  Employee  Benefits  and Entitlements and Work/Life Programs, establishes policies to ensure the AF enhances the morale of  its  civilian  employees  by  identifying  employment  requirements  and  pursuing  appropriate work/life flexibilities. Leave is an important and significant benefit for all employees. There is a mutual  employee-management  responsibility  to  plan  and  schedule  the  use  of  annual  leave throughout the year. The scheduling of leave is so important that by law it is a prerequisite to the restoration of annual leave that may be forfeited because of exigencies of the service or because of  sickness.  Managers  must  administer  leave  and  administrative  leaves  on  a  uniform  and equitable  basis  within  the  scope  of  applicable  laws  and  regulations.  They  must  base  their decisions to deny leave requests and cancel approved leave on the necessity for the employee’s services.  Denial  or  cancellation  of  leave  is  administrative  in  nature  and  cannot  be  used  as  a punitive measure. In granting leave, managers must consider the needs of the Air Force and the welfare  of  the  employees.  Authority  to  approve  leave  requests  is  normally  delegated  to  the lowest  supervisory  level  having  personal  knowledge  of  the  work  requirements  and  the employee’s leave record. This Instruction must be administered without unlawful discrimination because  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex  (including  pregnancy),  national  origin,  age  (40  or  older), disability, genetic information, or prior EEO activity. AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   9  Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.  Installation  Commanders  and  Directors,  Tenant  Commanders  and  Directors,  and Heads  of  Activities  to  Whom  Appointing  Authority  is  Delegated,  and  Commanders  of Combatant Commands shall: 2.1.1.  Administer leave in accordance to law and regulation. (T-1) 2.1.2.  Establish local policy as authorized in this Instruction. (T-1) 2.1.3.  Ensure  personnel  are  informed  of  their  rights,  responsibilities,  and  administrative requirements. (T-1) 2.1.4.  Assist operating officials in carrying out assigned responsibilities. (T-1) 2.1.5.  Identify and promptly correct sick leave abuses. (T-1) 2.1.6.  Ensure  compliance  with  applicable  directives  in  reporting  and  certifying  time  and attendance. (T-1) 2.1.7.  Installation commanders may designate the civilian personnel officer/section to act for them in carrying out these functions. (T-1) 2.1.8.  Authorize administrative leave in accordance with guidance in this Instruction. (T-1) 2.2.  Supervisors or Team Leaders Authorized to Approve Leave. 2.2.1.  Establish appropriate administrative procedures for requesting and approval of leave. Ensure  employees  under  their  supervision  are  informed  of  procedures  which  must  be followed in requesting and using leave. (T-1) 2.2.2.  Ensure all absences from duty are appropriately charged according to applicable laws and regulations. (T-1) 2.2.3.  Identify and promptly correct sick leave abuse. (T-1) 2.2.4.  Request advice and assistance from the Civilian Personnel Section (CPS) when there is a question concerning employee entitlements and type of leave appropriate to the situation. (T-1) 2.2.5.  Approve annual leave requests or projected annual leave when work schedules permit. When a request for annual leave cannot be initially approved or is subsequently denied, then make  every  effort  to  reschedule  the  annual  leave  commensurate  with  the  needs  of  the organization and the desires of the employee. (T-1) 2.3.  Employees must: 2.3.1.  Be dependable and report for work except when in an approved leave status. 2.3.2.  In accordance with applicable procedures, request leave in advance, and cooperate in rescheduling leave when necessary. 2.3.3.  Report unexpected absence to supervisor and request approval for absence according to established policies.   10  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 2.3.4.  Comply  with  DODD  5200.2,  DoD  Personnel  Security  Program,  and  AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, when planning travel to a foreign country during a period of approved leave. 2.3.5.  Comply with the requirement to provide contact information (i.e., telephone number, email  address,  etc.)  regarding  their  location  while  on  leave.  Air  Force  leadership  requires contact and location information on civilian employees should a recall be necessary or in the event of an emergency. AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   11  Chapter 3 LEAVE ADMINISTRATION 3.1.  Scheduling  Leave.  Leave  must  be  scheduled  and  approved  in  advance  except  in emergency situations. (T-0) Supervisors should normally maintain  projected leave schedules to assist in planning and assigning work. Employees provide projected leave at the beginning of the leave year, if need for leave is known. 3.2.  Documenting  Requests  for  Leave  or  Approved  Absence.  Requests  for  leave  must  be submitted  to  approving  officials,  in  writing,  on  OPM  71,  (Request  for  Leave  or  Approved Absence) or by using an approved automated timekeeping system. (T-0) NOTE: Procedures for requesting  and  approving  leave  for  bargaining  unit  employees  may  be  contained  in  applicable collective bargaining agreements. Contact your Civilian Personnel Section for guidance on local rules and procedures. 3.3.  Charges  to  Leave.  The  minimum  charge  for  either  annual  or  sick  leave  is  15  minutes. Additional leave is charged in increments of 15 minutes. The minimum charge for absence in a non-pay  status  LWOP  or  AWOL  is  charged  in  increments  of  15  minutes  for  the  actual  time absent.  Leave  is  charged  only  on  days  the  employee  would  otherwise  work  and  receive  pay. Leave is not charged for an absence on holidays or other nonwork days, except for when certain employees are paid additional compensation for standby duty (e.g., firefighters). Military leave is charged only for hours during which a civilian employee would otherwise have been scheduled to work and receive pay. 3.3.1.  If an employee is unavoidably absent or tardy for less than 1 hour, for a reason that is acceptable  to  the  supervisor,  the  supervisor  may  excuse  the  employee  without  charge  to leave. The supervisor may decide not  to  excuse the absence,  and may  charge the employee AWOL or approve an employee’s request for leave to cover the absence. 3.3.2.  When  an  employee  has  insufficient  annual  or  sick  leave  available  to  cover  an approved  leave  request,  the  excess  absence  is  charged  in  accordance  with  the  precedence established  in  the  Defense  Finance  and  Accounting  Service  (DFAS)  Leave  Conversion Matrix. If retroactive sick leave is approved later, it may be substituted for the leave category initially  charged.  However,  the  Comptroller  General  has  consistently  held  that,  when  leave has been requested, approved, and used, retroactive substitution of one category of leave for another category may be made only under the conditions of a specific law and/or regulation. The supervisors only annotate AWOL if he/she does not approve any, or all, of the period of absence. 3.4.  Employees  Serving  Time  Limited  Appointments.  An  employee  serving  under  a temporary or term appointment cannot be granted more leave than the amount that can be earned and credited before appointment expires. 3.5.  Employees  Transferring  Within  AF  or  From  another  Federal  Agency.  The  leave balance  on  the  last  leave  and  earnings  statement  are  acceptable  evidence  to  transfer  leave.  If necessary, the civilian payroll office will request an employee’s leave balance by telephone or e-mail from the losing civilian payroll office. If an employee requests leave and the leave record has not been received, the absence will be charged to LWOP pending receipt of leave records.   12  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 3.6.  Refund for Unearned Leave.  When an employee separates before accruing all previously advanced  leave,  the  value  of  unearned  leave  is  deducted  from  any  compensation  due.  A deduction is not required if the employee is separated for reasons of death, disability retirement, or resignation for physical disability that is evidenced by acceptable medical documentation. AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   13  Chapter 4 ANNUAL LEAVE 4.1.  Amount of Annual Leave Earned.  The amount of annual leave employees earn depends on  their  length  of  service  and  basic  workweek.  Full-time  employees  earn  leave  as  shown  in Table 4.1 4.1.1.  Employees are assigned to leave earning categories as follows: 4.1.1.1.  Category 1. Employees with less than 3 years of service. 4.1.1.2.  Category 2. Employees with 3 but less than 15 years of service. 4.1.1.3.  Category 3. Employees with 15 or more years of service. 4.1.2.  Part-time employees must have a regularly scheduled tour of duty to earn leave. (T-0)  However,  credit  is  given  for  the  time  they  are  in  a  pay  status  (including  the  hours  worked outside their scheduled tour of duty) not in  excess of 80 hours in the pay period as follows (see paragraph 4.1.1 for definition of categories): 4.1.2.1.  Category 1.  1 hour for each 20 hours in pay status. 4.1.2.2.  Category 2.  1 hour for each 13 hours in pay status. 4.1.2.3.  Category 3.  1 hour for each 10 hours in pay status. Table 4.1.

No  annual  leave  is  earned  within  a  pay  period  where  LWOP  or  AWOL  reaches  80 hours. 4.1.4.  Intermittent employees do not earn annual leave since by regulation, they do not have a regularly scheduled tour of duty. 4.2.  Maximum  Annual  Leave  Accumulation.  In  general,  the  maximum  amount  of  annual leave an employee may carry forward from one leave year to another is 30 days (240 hours), or the  amount  accumulated  under  earlier  statute,  whichever  is  greater.  Any  leave  to  employee’s   14  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 credit  at  end  of  leave  year  that  exceeds  maximum  accumulation  is  either  forfeited  or  restored according to paragraph 4.14. 4.2.1.  Uncommon  Tours  of  Duty.    To  calculate  maximum  amount  of  annual  leave  for employees on uncommon tours of duty, the formula is:  Multiply 240 times number of hours in workweek; divide result by 40.  Example:  Maximum accumulation for an employee with a 72-hour standby workweek is 432 hours.  Maximum accumulation for an employee with a 56-hour workweek is 336 hours. 4.2.2.  OCONUS  US  Citizens.    US  citizens  employed  outside  the  United  States  (except  for certain local hires), maximum annual leave accumulation is 45 days (360 hours) or amount to employee’s credit at beginning of leave year, whichever is greater. Employees eligible for 45 days of cumulative annual leave are normally those who are under a transportation agreement in the overseas area.  Upon return from overseas, maximum annual leave accumulation is 30 days (240 hours) or amount carried over from previous leave year, whichever is greater, not to exceed 45 days (360 hours). 4.2.3.  Civilian  Senior  Executives.  For  SES  employees,  there  is  a  maximum  limitation  on annual  leave  accumulation  of  90  days  (720  hours)  or  amount  accumulated  under  earlier statute, whichever is greater. 4.3.  When  Annual  Leave  Becomes  Available  for  Use.  The  projected  annual  leave  an employee will earn during a leave year will be available for planning purposes at the beginning of the leave year. 4.3.1.  Appointments  for  90  Calendar  Days  or  More.    Employees  may  use  annual  leave during the first 90 days of employment. 4.3.2.  Appointments for Less than 90 Calendar Days.  Employees are not entitled to annual leave  until  after  being  employed  for  a  continuous  period  of  90  days  under  successive appointments without a break in service. 4.3.3.  If an employee has a series of successive appointments, without a break in service of 1 day  or  more,  which  then  exceeds  90  days,  employee  is  credited  with  annual  leave  which would have accrued from the date of initial appointment. 4.4.  Scheduling  Annual  Leave  to  Avoid  Forfeiture.  Employees  should  take  positive  action before  the  beginning  of  the  third  full  pay  period  prior  to  the  end  of  leave  year  to  schedule  or reschedule canceled leave so as to avoid situations where employees approach end of leave year with a significant amount of annual leave that must be used or forfeited. 4.4.1.  Written  leave  schedules  should  be  used  to  certify  required  scheduling  was accomplished when requesting restoration of forfeited annual leave. 4.4.2.  When  employees  choose  not  to  request  or  use  annual  leave  to  avoid  forfeiture,  they are not entitled to have forfeited leave restored for later use. 4.4.3.  Employees  should  use  previously  earned  compensatory  time  before  accrued  annual leave unless it will result in forfeiture of leave. 4.5.  When  Annual  Leave  is  Granted.  Employees  are  granted  annual  leave  to  allow  time  off for vacations and for personal and emergency purposes. The use of annual leave is a right of the AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   15  employee in  that the employee is  either  given an opportunity to  use the annual  leave, or to  the extent permitted by law, is paid for it at the time of separation. 4.5.1.  Except  in  cases  of  emergency,  annual  leave  must  be  requested  by  employee  and approved by appropriate leave-approving official in advance of the absence. (T-0) 4.5.2.  Supervisors must ensure all employees are informed of the procedures to follow when requesting and obtaining approval of leave. (T-0) This includes requests for annual leave in advance of the absence as well as leave for emergencies. 4.5.3.  Supervisors should consider employees’ desires and personal  convenience as well as work  situation  when  granting  leave.  Supervisors  must  not  make  arbitrary  decisions  to  deny leave.      (T-0) 4.5.4.  Requests for annual leave must be submitted to approving official in writing on OPM 71, Request for Leave or Approved Absence, or by using an approved automated timekeeping system, unless otherwise prescribed by a collective bargaining agreement. (T-1) 4.6.  Advancing Annual Leave. 4.6.1.  An employee may be granted all annual leave to be earned during current leave year.  Advanced annual leave may be requested for any number of reasons to include for foster care placement in  their home or bonding with  a healthy newborn or newly  adopted child. When advancing  an  employee  annual  leave  in  excess  of  amount  actually  earned,  the  supervisor authorized  to  approve  leave  must  have  reasonable  assurance  that  the  employee  will  be  in  a duty status long enough to earn the leave granted before the end of the leave year. (T-1) 4.6.2.  Obtaining Employee’s Current Leave Balance.  Employee’s current leave balance may be obtained by the supervisor by accessing civilian personnel data systems (Civilian Support Unit  (CSU)  Application)  at  the  work  site  or  by  contacting  the  local  civilian  payroll  liaison office. 4.6.2.1.  The  leave  approving  official’s  certification  of  the  time  card  is  acceptable evidence that leave reported has been approved. 4.6.3.  If  an  employee’s  employment  with  the  government  discontinues  prior  to  earning advanced leave, the balance of advanced leave upon separation is considered a debt, unless employee  dies,  retires  for  disability,  resigns,  or  is  separated  as  a  result  of  a  disability  that prevents employee from returning to work. 4.7.  Use of Annual Leave before Separation.  A supervisor may not grant an employee annual leave when the supervisor knows the employee will not return from leave of absence to federal service, except when: 4.7.1.  Employee  is  separated  because  of  reduction-in-force  or  declination  of  transfer  of function used to extend separation date to attain first eligibility for retirement annuity and/or Federal Employees Health Benefit (FEHB) annuitant coverage. 4.7.2.  Employee is carried in a leave status pending acceptance for active military duty. 4.7.3.  Employee has made application for disability retirement. 4.7.4.  Employee has taken annual leave prior to separation, but is present for, and performs duty  on  the  employee’s  last  administrative  workday.    For  example,  an  employee  who  is  a   16  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 military  spouse  must  be  present  on  last  duty  day  prior  to  his/her  LWOP  to  accompany spouse. (T-0) 4.7.5.  Employee  has  taken  accrued  annual  leave  during  final  hours  of  last  day  of employment  before  separation,  providing  employee  substantially  worked  entire  final  pay period, including part of last day. 4.8.  Lump-Sum  Payment  Upon  Separation.  Upon  separation,  an  employee  is  entitled  to  all accumulated and accrued annual leave credited to employee who consists of the following:  (1) regular carry-over balances from previous year, if any; plus (2) accrued and unused annual leave during  current  leave  year,  if  any;  plus  (3)  any  unused  restored  annual  leave  maintained  in  a separate leave account. 4.9.  Use of Annual Leave during Active Military Duty.  Members of the Reserve or National Guard may use annual leave during active military duty. 4.10.  Requiring Employees To Take Leave.  Employees may not be placed on annual leave: 4.10.1.  As a disciplinary measure. 4.10.2.  Pending  issuance  of  a  proposal  or  decision  notice  to  take  an  adverse  action,  unless requested by employee. 4.10.3.  During notice period before adverse action, unless requested by employee. 4.10.4.  Otherwise,  employees  may  be  placed  on  annual  leave  as  the  needs  of  the  service require;  for  example,  during  a  period  of  reduced  or  suspended  operations  or  where  an employee is instructed to take vacation leave at a time other than at the specific time initially requested.  Required  use  of  annual  leave  must  be  based  on  factors  that  are  reasonable  and equitable, which do not discriminate among employees, and which are not arbitrary. (T-1) 4.11.  Substituting  Annual  Leave  for  LWOP.  Substitutions  may  be  made  in  the  following circumstances: 4.11.1.  LWOP  may  be  charged  for  annual  leave,  pending  receipt  of  an  employee’s  leave record  from  the  former  employing  agency.  Upon  receipt  of  the  leave  record,  annual  leave will be substituted for the LWOP. 4.11.2.  LWOP  is  granted  to  an  employee  pending  a  re-credit  of  annual  leave  following  a refund of a lump sum leave payment; annual leave may be substituted for LWOP, provided employee requests substitution at the time LWOP is requested. 4.12.  Substituting  Annual  Leave  for  Sick  Leave.  An  employee  on  extended  sick  leave (including sick leave for maternity reasons) may be granted annual leave to cover any part of the absence,  provided  request  for  leave  is  made  in  advance.    Annual  leave  cannot  be  substituted retroactively for sick leave previously taken as a means of avoiding a forfeiture of annual leave at  end  of  the  leave  year.    Advanced  sick  leave  may  be  liquidated  at  employee’s  request  by  a substitution of annual leave, provided substitution is requested before the time the annual leave would be forfeited. 4.13.  When  Lump-Sum  Payments  Are  Made.  Normally,  separated  employees  (including those overseas who are allowed a 45-day annual leave accumulation) are paid a lump sum for all accumulated annual leave. AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   17  4.13.1.  There are exceptions to this general requirement, such as employees entering military service,  employees  transferring  to  an  international  organization,  employees  converted  to  a Nonappropriated  Fund  (NAF)  position,  and  employees  removed  from  a  position  to  which they were illegally appointed. 4.13.2.  An employee entering military service may elect to allow annual leave to remain in the leave account or to receive a lump-sum payment. 4.13.3.  When an employee dies, lump-sum payment made to survivors includes payment for all accrued and accumulated annual leave to employee’s credit at time of death. 4.13.4.  When a Refund  of  Lump-Sum  Annual  Leave Payment  Is Required: If  an employee who  has  received  a  lump-sum  annual  leave  payment  is  reemployed  before  end  of  period covered by payment, employee must refund an amount equal to gross compensation received for unexpired portion of lump-sum leave period.  This includes pay before deductions of any kind and, if applicable, differentials and allowances received. 4.14.  Restoration  of  Forfeited  Annual  Leave.  Annual  leave  which  would  otherwise  be forfeited  may  be  restored  when  it  is  lost  because  of  exigencies  of  service  or  sickness  of employee,  if  use  of  leave  was  scheduled  in  advance.  Leave  may  also  be  restored  when  an administrative  error  causes  loss  of  annual  leave  otherwise  accruable.  Before  forfeited  annual leave  may  be  considered  for  restoration,  use  of  annual  leave  must  have  been  requested, approved, and scheduled in writing before start of third biweekly pay period before end of leave year. (T-0) 4.14.1.  Exigencies  of  Service.    Before  forfeited  annual  leave  is  restored,  there  must  be  a determination the exigency is of major importance and an employee may not use scheduled annual  leave.    (T-0)  The  following  officials,  or  their  designee,  have  authority  to  approve exigencies causing cancellation of leave: 4.14.1.1.  Administrative  Assistant  to  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  for  all  employees  in Office of the Secretary of the Air Force and other employees not within the purview of paragraphs 4.14.1.2 through 4.14.1.4 below. 4.14.1.2.  Assistant Vice Chief of Staff for all Air Staff employees not within the purview of paragraph 4.14.1.3 below. 4.14.1.3.  Deputy Chiefs of Staff for their employees. 4.14.1.4.  Installation  Commander,  or  his/her  designee,  tenant  commanders  or  heads  of activities. 4.14.1.5.  An  employee  may  submit  a  claim  to  the  Office  of  Personnel  Management (OPM) if a request for restoration of annual leave based on an exigency is denied. Claims subject  to  negotiated  grievance  procedures  will  be  processed  in  accordance  with  the negotiated procedures. 4.14.2.  Exigency  of  Service  Approval  Process.    Normally,  approval  of  an  exigency  is required  in  advance  of  cancellation  of  leave.    In  the  event  of  an  emergency,  this determination must be made as soon after the occurrence of the emergency as possible. (T-1) 4.14.2.1.  As  soon  as  it  is  known  leave  will  be  canceled  and  forfeiture  will  be unavoidable,  the  supervisor  initiates  a  letter  to  designated  official  explaining  exigency   18  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 and requesting approval to cancel scheduled leave.  The supervisor coordinates letter with CPS  to  ensure  conditions  for  restoration  in  governing  directives  are  met,  and documentation to support request includes the following: 4.14.2.1.1.  Specific  beginning  and  ending  dates  of  exigency  period,  unless suddenness  or  uncertainty  of  circumstances  prevents  advance  determination.    Dates are  needed  to  establish  specific  period  within  which  employee  was  prevented  from using annual leave. 4.14.2.1.2.  Dates and number of hours scheduled which must be canceled, and when leave was scheduled and approved. 4.14.2.1.3.  Description of exigency which shows that it is of such importance that the employee cannot be excused from duty. 4.14.2.1.4.  Statement  as  to  why  there  is  no  alternative  to  cancellation  of  scheduled leave and why use of leave cannot be rescheduled during remainder of year. 4.14.2.1.5.  Designated  official  renders  a  decision  on  request  and  returns  it  through CPS to originating supervisor for transmittal to employee. 4.14.3.  Establishing Restored Leave Account due to Exigency of the Service. 4.14.3.1.  Promptly  after  leave  year  ends,  employee  should  submit  a  request  for restoration  of  leave  with  approval  of  exigency  with  supporting  documentation,  stating actual number of hours lost on specific dates that could not be rescheduled, and forwards it through supervisor for endorsement to CPS. 4.14.3.2.  CPS  will  review  request  and  upon  determination  that  documentation  is  in compliance, will endorse to civilian payroll office which, in turn, sends to local finance office for establishment of a Restored Annual Leave Account, with a copy to employee. 4.14.3.3.  Sickness of the Employee. Employee initiates request for restoration of annual leave  forfeited  as  a  result  of  sickness  as  soon  as  leave  year  ends  and  has  supervisor endorse it to servicing CPS. Request must contain the following: 4.14.3.3.1.  Specific  beginning  and,  where  known,  ending  dates  of  the  period  of illness  or  incapacity  which  interfered  with  the  use  of  annual  leave.    The  supervisor has the option of requiring medical documentation. (T-1) 4.14.3.3.2.  Dates  and  number  of  hours  of  annual  leave  scheduled  which  had  to  be canceled; and when this leave was scheduled and approved. (T-1) 4.14.3.3.3.  Information  as  to  why  canceled  annual  leave  could  not  be  rescheduled before the end of the leave year. (T-1) 4.14.3.3.4.  The CPS reviews request  and, upon  determination that documentation is in compliance, endorses to civilian payroll office and sends to local finance office for establishment of a Restored Annual Leave Account, with a copy to employee.  (T-1) 4.14.4.  Base  Closure  and  Realignment.  Any  leave  lost  by  an  employee  at  a  Department  of Defense installation undergoing closure or realignment shall be restored to the employee and shall  be  credited  to  the  employee’s  leave  account.  Closing  of  a  base  is  an  exigency  of  the service permitting employees to carry over use-or-lose leave without meeting the criteria for AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   19  restoration. When an employee no longer occupies such a position, a lump-sum payment is made for annual leave over statutory annual leave accrual limitations (e.g. 240 or 360 hours). (T-0) 4.14.5.  Personnel  in  a  Combat  Zone.  Any  leave  lost  by  an  employee  serving  in  Combat Zone, regardless of whether such leave was scheduled, shall be restored to the employee and shall be credited to the employee’s leave account. The term “combat zone” has the meaning given  such  term  in  section  112(c)(2)  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986.  This  includes employees assigned for any amount of time. (T-0) 4.14.6.  Using Restored  Leave. Restored annual  leave must be used by the end of the leave year, ending two years after termination date of exigency of public business, that resulted in forfeiture of annual leave; or the date the employee is determined to be recovered and able to return  to  duty  if  the  leave  was  forfeited  because  of  sickness;  or  the  date  of  restoration  of annual  leave  forfeited  because  of  administrative  error.  (T-0)  The  two-year  deadline  of  this provision does not apply to employees covered by Paragraph 4.14.4, above. 4.15.  Administrative Error.  When an administrative error causes loss of leave, all leave must be restored. (T-0) Official leave records should be used to substantiate amount of annual leave to be  restored.    If  these  records  are  not  available,  an  estimate  of  employee’s  leave  account  is acceptable if accompanied by required documentation to explain basis for estimate. If employee is separated before error is discovered, restored leave is subject to credit and liquidation by lump-sum payment if a claim is filed within 3 years immediately following date of discovery of error.   20  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 Chapter 5 SICK LEAVE 5.1.  Amount of Sick Leave Earned.  All full-time employees on a 40-hour basic workweek or an  80-hour  biweekly  work  schedule,  regardless  of  their  length  of  service,  earn  4  hours  of  sick leave  for  each  full  biweekly  pay  period.  Employees  on  uncommon  tours  of  duty,  such  as firefighters, earn sick leave at a proportionate rate. (See  Table  4.1., Category 1, for examples.) Part-time  employees  are  credited  with  sick  leave  in  an  amount  equal  to  the  amount  of  annual leave  credited  to  employees  in  Category  1  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4.1.2.  No  sick  leave  is accrued in a pay period where LWOP or AWOL equals the number of base pay hours in a pay period.  Intermittent  employees  do  not  earn  sick  leave  since  by  regulation,  they  do  not  have  a regularly scheduled tour of duty. 5.2.  Use  of  Sick  Leave.  Sick leave is a qualified right of the employee and may be used only for absences: 5.2.1.  When an employee has become unable to perform his/her duties by physical or mental illness,  injury,  or  illness  from  immunizations  or  vaccinations  (whether  or  not  required  as  a condition of employment). 5.2.2.  For  medical,  dental,  or  optical  examination  or  treatment,  including  periodic  physical examination for retention of status in a Reserve component of the Armed Forces or National Guard. 5.2.3.  When  a  member  of  an  employee’s  immediate  family  is  afflicted  with  a  contagious disease and requires the care and attendance of the employee, or when, through exposure to contagious  disease,  the  presence  at  work  of  the  employee  would  endanger  the  health  of others. 5.2.4.  To participate in drug or alcohol counseling programs. 5.2.5.  When  a  birth  mother  is  incapacitated,  care  of  birth  mother  during  period  of incapacitation, or doctor appointments for birth parents or newborn child. 5.2.6.  To  make  arrangements  for  adoption  or  foster  care-related  activities,  including appointments  with  adoption  agencies,  social  workers  and  attorneys;  court  proceedings; required  travel;  and  any  other  activities  necessary  to  allow  the  adoption  to  proceed.  This includes periods during which the adoptive or foster care parent is home to care for the newly adopted child, as required by the adoption agency or by the court. Leave can be sick leave, annual  leave  or  LWOP.  Because  prospective  adoptive  and  foster  parents  commonly  must make  a  commitment  that  one  parent  will  remain  at  home  for  several  months  in  order  to qualify,  special  consideration  should  be  given  to  requests  for  leave  for  this  purpose.  Supervisors are encouraged to be responsive in granting leave to meet the needs of adoptive parents.  (T-0) 5.2.7.  See paragraph 5.3 below for an explanation of sick leave for general family care and bereavement purposes under the 13-day entitlement. 5.3.  Limited Amount of Sick Leave Use for Family Care.  Sick leave may be used to provide care for a family member as a result of physical or mental illness, injury, pregnancy, childbirth, AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   21  or medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment; or to make arrangements necessitated by the  death  of  a  family  member  or  attend  the  funeral  of  a  family  member.  A  full-time  employee may  use  up  to  104  hours  (13  days)  of  his/her  sick  leave  each  leave  year  for  family  care  and bereavement  purposes.  Part-time  employees  and  employees  with  uncommon  tours  of  duty  are also  covered.  They  may  use  an  amount  of  leave-not  to  exceed  the  number  of  sick  leave  hours normally accrued by that employee in a leave year. For example, an employee scheduled to work 56/60/72 hours per week, could use 112, 120, or 144 hours. The definition of a family member may be found at Attachment 1 of this instruction. See Chapter 12 for guidance on approval and use of sick leave under the FMLA, which permits up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for the serious  health  condition  of  the  employee  or  a  more  narrowly  defined  group  of  his/her  family members. 5.4.  Relationship  to  Voluntary  Leave  Transfer  Program.  Employees  approved  for  the voluntary leave transfer program are required to use their sick leave before using donated annual leave.    Under  this  program,  an  employee  may  receive  donated  annual  leave  from  other employees if he or she is affected by a personal or family medical emergency and has exhausted his or her available paid annual and sick leave. (See Chapter 11) 5.5.  How  Sick  Leave  Is  Requested  and  Approved.  Sick  leave  for  scheduled  medical appointments  (including  dental  or  optical  examinations  or  treatment  and  drug  and  alcohol counseling sessions) must be requested in advance of the absence. (T-0) 5.5.l.    Sick leave for absence because of illness, injury, exposure to contagious disease, illness of a family member with a contagious disease or other circumstances of incapacity which are not known  in  advance  must  be  requested  as  soon  as  possible  after  the  beginning  of  the  absence (normally within the first two hours of the duty day). (T-0) 5.5.2.  For  absences  of  3  days  or  less,  sick  leave  must  be  requested  on  the  first  day  and  on every  additional  day  of  absence,  unless  the  supervisor  relieves  the  employee  of  this requirement. (T-0) 5.5.3.  Requests  for  sick  leave  for  nonemergency  medical  appointments,  even  though submitted  with  proper  evidence,  may  be  denied  if  it  is  determined  that  the  employee’s services are needed. 5.5.4.  If  the  employee  fails  to  follow  prescribed  procedures  for  requesting  or  documenting either  emergency  or  nonemergency  sick  leave,  the  request  may  be  denied  if  the  supervisor considers extenuating circumstances insufficient to warrant approval. 5.6.  Absences  of  More  Than  3  Days.  Sick  leave  of  more  than  3  consecutive  scheduled workdays for employees on a “normal” administrative workweek (e.g., 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week  or  compressed  5/4-9)  must  be  supported  by  medical  documentation  (or  other administratively  acceptable  documentation  for  absence)  unless  the  supervisor  waives  this requirement. (T-0) 5.6.1.  The  medical  documentation  must  be  administratively  acceptable  to  the  supervisor, must  cover  all  absences  beyond  the  third  workday  and  specify  that  the  employee  was incapacitated  for  duty  for  the  entire  period  covered  by  the  statement.  As  a  minimum,  the health care provider should be requested to provide an estimate of the expected date of full or partial “Medical Documentation/Certification”).  In cases of extended illness, medical documentation may be in  Attachment recovery, as explained 1 (Terms,   22  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 required periodically, if necessary to establish the employee’s continued incapacity to return to duty. For employees on uncommon tours of duty (such as firefighters) scheduled on a “24 hour  on,  24  hours  off”  basis,  sick  leave  for  more  than  2  consecutive  24-hour  duty  periods must be supported by medical documentation unless the supervisor waives this requirement. If there is any doubt as to the validity or adequacy of the medical documentation presented to support  a  request  for  sick  leave,  the  medical  officer  at  the  installation  may  be  requested  to review  the  documentation  submitted  and  with  the  employee’s  permission,  to  consult  the employee’s health care provider for additional information. Where evidence does not justify the  approval  of  sick  leave,  the  employee  may  request  to  use  some  other  paid  or  non-paid leave.  The  supervisor  will  consider  the  employee’s  alternative  absence  request,  and  may either approve the employee’s request or charge the employee with  AWOL, as appropriate.  Leave under the FMLA has different medical documentation rules, see Chapter 12. (T-0) 5.6.2.  The  employee  must  provide  administratively  acceptable  evidence  or  medical documentation for a request for sick leave no later than 15 calendar days after the date it is requested.  If it is not practicable under the particular circumstances to provide the requested evidence or medical documentation within 15 calendar days after the date requested despite the  employee’s  diligent,  good  faith  efforts,  the  employee  must  provide  the  evidence  or medical documentation within a reasonable period of time under the circumstances involved, but  no  later  than  30  calendar  days  after  the  date  requested.    An  employee  who  does  not provide the required evidence or medical documentation within the specified time period is not entitled to sick leave. (T-0) 5.6.3.  An employee requesting sick leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition  may  be  required  to  provide  an  additional  written  statement  from  the  health  care provider  concerning  the  family  member’s  need  for  psychological  comfort  and/or  physical care.    The  statement  must  certify  that  the  family  member  requires  psychological  comfort and/or  physical  care;  the  family  member  would  benefit  from  employee’s  care  or  presence; and employee is needed to care for the family member for a specified period of time. (T-0) 5.6.4.  When there is reason to believe that an employee is  abusing sick leave, contact  your local servicing CPS. Medical documentation may be required for absences of 3 days or less. 5.7.  Absences Due to Contagious Disease.  Sick leave due to exposure to contagious disease or the illness of a member of the immediate family with a contagious disease must be supported by medical documentation regardless of the length of the absence. When an employee requests sick leave because a family member has a contagious disease, the employee must present a statement from the attending physician or health care provider to show that the family member requires the employee’s  care  and  attendance  as  well  as  the  fact  that  the  disease  is  subject  to  quarantine  or isolation  of  the  patient  by  public  health  authorities  having  jurisdiction.  (See  definition  of contagious  disease  in  Attachment  1).    Leave  under  the  FMLA  has  different  medical documentation rules, see Chapter 12. (T-0) 5.8.  Return  to  Duty  After  Illness.  Any  requirement  for  clearance  with  the  medical  facility before returning to work must be limited to those specific cases where there is reason to believe that presence at work would endanger the employee’s health or would constitute a health hazard to  others.    The  medical  officer  at  the  installation  may  be  asked  to  assist  the  leave-approving official in assessing when this is appropriate. (T-0) AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   23  5.9.  Substituting  Sick  Leave  for  Annual  Leave.  If  illness  occurs  during  a  period  of  annual leave,  sick  leave  may  be  substituted  contingent  upon  submission  of  supporting  evidence acceptable to the supervisor, which may include the requirement for medical documentation. 5.10.  Disabled  Veterans.  A  disabled  veteran  who  presents  an  administratively  acceptable statement  from  a  physician  or  other  duly  constituted  medical  authority  showing  that  medical examination, treatment or absence in connection with the service-connected disability is required must be granted all sick leave (including advanced sick leave), and all annual leave permitted by law,  plus  any  LWOP  that  may  be  necessary  to  undergo  treatment.    Except  for  emergency treatment, the granting of such leave is contingent upon the veteran’s giving prior notice of the definite periods of required absence so that arrangements can be made for carrying on the work during the absence. (T-0) 5.11.  Outside Employment During Sick Leave.  As a general rule, sick leave is not approved for a period of absence during which an employee engages in outside employment.  Exception is made  when  the  nature  of  the  employee’s  illness  or  disability  and  the  nature  of  the  outside employment  make  it  clearly  evident  that  the  employee  is  still  incapacitated  for  the  regular  job while  engaging  in  the  outside  employment.    However,  before  engaging  in  outside  employment during a period of sick leave, the employee must notify the leave-approving official of the nature of the employment and furnish acceptable evidence of incapacitation for duty.  NOTE:  Before allowing  an  individual  to  engage  in  outside  employment  during  a  period  of  sick  leave,  the supervisor must make every reasonable effort to furnish light duty or appropriate detail duties the employee can perform. (T-0) 5.12.  Treatment  of  Injury  in  Performance  of  Duty.  On  the  date  of  injury,  an  employee injured in the performance of duty is considered to be in a duty status during the time required for initial  examination or emergency treatment  by  a federal  physician or  by a facility  officially authorized to treat employees injured on duty.  An employee who suffers a traumatic on-the-job injury may elect to use sick leave and/or annual leave or 45 days continuation of pay (COP).  If the  claim  is  denied,  the  employee  may  request  sick  or  annual  leave  to  cover  the  period  of absence.    An  employee  also  has  the  option  to  “buy  back”  sick  leave  used  in  relation  to  a  job-related injury or illness.  Employees are entitled to use any accrued and accumulated sick leave to their credit when they suffer a work-related illness or disease.  While awaiting adjudication of a  claim  for  compensation  by  the  Office  of  Workers’  Compensation  Program  (OWCP),  the employee  is  entitled  to  use  available  sick  or  annual  leave,  or  LWOP,  as  requested.    However, workers’  compensation  benefits  may  only  be  paid  to  employees  for  periods  of  LWOP.  LWOP during OWCP determination and adjudication would be paid under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 81. 5.13.  Use  of  Advance  Sick  Leave.  An  advance  of  sick  leave  is  a  privilege  which  may  be extended to employees. It is not considered a routine or standard procedure and will be granted only  after  all  circumstances  have  been  carefully  weighed.  In  case  of  serious  disability,  illness, incapacitation, or for childbirth or adoption, up to 30 work days (240 hours) of sick leave may be advanced  to  a  full-time  employee,  or  equivalent  for  uncommon  tours  of  duty  based  on  each individual instance. 5.13.1.  To  determine  the  maximum  amount  of  sick  leave  that  can  be  advanced  for  an employee  on  an  uncommon  tour  of  duty,  multiply  240  hours  by  weekly  hours  in  the uncommon tour and divide by 40 (240 x weekly uncommon tour/40=maximum hours).   24  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 5.13.2.  Employees  requesting  advanced  sick  leave  to  provide  care  for  a  family  member  or for  bereavement  purposes  may  be  advanced  sick  leave  in  an  amount  not  to  exceed  the maximum allowable (104 hours per leave year for full time employees). 5.13.3.  Requests  for  advanced  sick  leave  may  be  made  before  or  during  the  period  of absence but no later than the employee’s return to duty. 5.13.4.  In  granting  advance  sick  leave  consider:    the  employee’s  prior  sick  leave  history; annual  leave  versus  sick  leave  balance  history;  length  of  continuous  employment;  and whether  all  accumulated  sick  leave  to  the  employee’s  credit  has  been  exhausted.    Also consider requiring the employee to use any annual leave which may be subject to forfeiture. 5.13.5.  When it is known that the employee is to be retired or otherwise separated, the total advance may not exceed an amount which can be liquidated by accrual before separation. 5.13.6.  An application for advance sick leave must be supported by medical documentation signed by a physician or health care provider. In all cases, a statement indicating the date the employee is expected to return to normal duties is required.  (T-0) NOTE:  Supervisors are cautioned  that  only  the  information  necessary  to  make  a  decision  should  be  required.  However,  until  the  supervisor  has  sufficient  information  upon  which  to  base  a  decision,  no advance can be granted. 5.13.7.  Advance sick leave is not granted if it is considered likely that the employee will not return  to  duty  for  a  sufficient  period  of  time  to  repay  the  advanced  leave,  or  there  are insufficient funds in the employee’s retirement account to liquidate the indebtedness. 5.13.8.  Advance  sick  leave  should  not  be  advanced  to  the  employee  until  all  accumulated sick leave has been exhausted. 5.13.9.  Advance sick leave is liquidated automatically through accrual of sick leave after the employee returns to work.  Repayment is not required when separation is because of death, resignation  for  disability  supported  by  acceptable  medical  documentation,  or  disability retirement. 5.13.10.  An unliquidated advance is carried forward from pay period to pay period and from one leave year to the next until liquidated by subsequent accrual.  If the employee requests, advanced sick leave may  be liquidated by  a charge against an equivalent  amount of annual leave.  When an employee separates from federal service before liquidating the advance, the balance is liquidated in the following order by: 5.13.10.1.  Charge against available annual leave. 5.13.10.2.  Setoff against earned salary or unapplied savings bond balances. 5.13.10.3.  Request for retirement setoff. 5.14.  Availability  and  Recredit  of  Sick  Leave.  Sick  leave  becomes  available  for  use  at  the beginning of the pay period during which it is earned.  There is no limitation on the amount of sick  leave  that  may  be  carried  forward  from  one  year  to  another.    Any  sick  leave  to  an employee’s  credit  upon  separation  from  federal  service  may  be  re-credited  if  the  individual  is reemployed unless the sick leave was used in the computation of an annuity. AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   25  Chapter 6 LEAVE WITHOUT PAY (LWOP) 6.1.  When  LWOP  Is  Granted.  LWOP  is  a  temporary  non-pay  status  and  an  authorized absence  from  duty  granted  only  upon  the  employee’s  request,  in  situations  such  as  when  the employee  has  insufficient  annual  or  sick  leave,  or  compensatory  time  available  to  cover  an approved absence. An employee does not have to exhaust annual leave before requesting LWOP. LWOP  cannot  be  imposed  as  a  penalty,  nor  can  an  employee  be  required  to  request  LWOP  in lieu  of  suspension.  The  granting  of  LWOP  is  a  matter  of  administrative  discretion  except  as specified below. Even though LWOP is a non-pay status, it is still approved leave and must be requested  by  the  employee  and  approved  by  the  supervisor.  An  employee  must  work  an established regular tour of duty during the administrative workweek in order to qualify for leave benefits.  Regularly  scheduled  work  is  defined  as  work  that  is  scheduled  in  advance  of  an administrative  workweek  under  the  agency’s  procedures  for  establishing  workweeks.  LWOP must  not  be  confused  with  AWOL,  which  is  charged  for  unauthorized  absence,  or  absence  for which  the  employee  did  not  request  and  obtain  approval  of  leave.  Even  though  the  reason  for requesting  LWOP  is  known  to  be  legitimate,  e.g.,  illness,  injury,  or  personal  emergency,  the request  may  be  denied  if  the  employee’s  services  are  required  or  if  the  employee  has  not followed prescribed leave procedures. (T-0) 6.1.1.  LWOP  Mandated  by  Law.  LWOP  must  be  granted  in  the  following  three circumstances to: 6.1.1.1.  A  disabled  veteran  to  cover  an  absence  for  medical  treatment  related  to  a service-connected  disability.  (See  Uniformed  Services  Employment  and  Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA). (T-0) 6.1.1.2.  A member of the Reserve or National Guard to perform military training and/or active duty. All periods of LWOP for this purpose must be documented in personnel and pay  systems  as  Absent-US.    An  employee  does  not  have  to  be  a  Reservist  or  National Guardsman in order to be granted mandatory LWOP. (See USERRA.) (T-0) 6.1.1.3.  An  employee  who  requests  LWOP  under  the  Family  and  Medical  Leave  Act (FMLA). (T-0) 6.1.2.  LWOP Mandated by Regulation.  If the employee has followed leave procedures, the granting of LWOP is mandatory under the following circumstances: 6.1.2.1.  Supervisors  must  approve  LWOP  to  protect  an  employee’s  status  and  benefits pending  action by the Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs  (OWCP) on a claim resulting from a work-related illness or injury or during a period the employee is carried on  the  rolls  while  being  compensated  by  the  OWCP.    NOTE:    If  an  employee  who  is receiving  compensation  payments  is  separated,  it  is  more  administratively  difficult  to return them to duty than if they had been retained in a LWOP status.  This is due largely to requirements imposed by OWCP. If the employee meets the requisite requirements for continued  Federal  Employees  Health  Benefits  (FEHB)  and  Federal  Employees’  Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) enrollment, transfer FEHB to OWCP after 10 months of LWOP and  transfer  FEGLI  to  OWCP  after  12  months  of  LWOP.  (See  FEHB  and  FEGLI Handbooks  for  additional  guidance.)    Employees  receiving  compensation  should  be   26  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 retained  in  a  LWOP  status  for  12  months  rather  than  separated  unless  there  is  medical evidence of the employee being unable to return to work within that time.  (T-0) 6.1.2.2.  To avoid a break in service for career and career-conditional employees who are dependents of a military member or a federal civilian employee or who are dependents of an individual who is employed by a public or private sector organization and who must relocate because of the involuntary transfer of the head of the household.  This does not include voluntary moves for promotion or a new job. (Dependents of a public or private sector  employee  must  provide  acceptable  evidence  of  the  requirement  to  transfer.    For DoD  dependents,  orders  are  acceptable  evidence.)  Such  employees,  whose  travel  and transportation  are  covered  by  their  sponsor’s  eligibility,  are  granted  LWOP  upon  their request  for  a  period  of  up  to  150  days  to  allow  an  opportunity  to  secure  federal employment.  A resignation SF-52 must be submitted along with the request for LWOP.  The  losing  supervisor  may  fill  behind  immediately  as  long  as  the  projected  resignation SF-52 has also been submitted by the departing employee.  Additional LWOP, up to 12 months,  may  be  granted  at  the  option  of  the  former  leave-approving  supervisor.    Also eligible under this provision are former spouses of sponsors following death, divorce, or legal separation if they accompanied the sponsor on a permanent change of station to the current  duty  station.    Because  the  purpose  and  conditions  of  appointment  under  the Schedule A dependent hire authority and under the overseas limited authority are meant only  for  employment  in  foreign  areas,  LWOP  may  not  be  granted  to  any  employee serving under these authorities who is  leaving that employment for  return to  the United States  unless  the  employee  has  eligibility  for  appointment  under  Executive  Order  (EO) 12362  (as  amended  by  EO  12721),  i.e.,  12  months  service  in  the  overseas  area.    An employee who is granted LWOP has to perform duty on the last duty day prior to the start of the LWOP.  It is not appropriate to exhaust annual leave before LWOP in cases where the basis for LWOP is that the employee must relocate because of the transfer of the head of household.  This means they are not expected to return to work.  Annual leave is only appropriate in instances where the employee is expected to return to work.  (T-0) 6.1.3.  Seasonal  employment.  Seasonal  employees  are  placed  in  a  non-pay  status,  not  in  a LWOP status, when released from duty due to workload requirements or seasonal nature of work. Seasonal employees may be granted LWOP from their regular scheduled tour of duty at their request IAW the provisions of this chapter. 6.1.4.  LWOP in Other Circumstances.  LWOP in other cases should be granted only when it is  apparent  that  it  will  result  in  increased  job  capability,  protection  or  improvement  of  the employee’s  health,  or  the  retention  of  a  desirable  employee.    Circumstances  in  which  the approval of LWOP is discretionary include (but are not limited to) the following: 6.1.4.1.  For  educational  purposes  when  the  course  of  study  is  in  line  with  work performed  within  the  Air  Force  and  completion  of  the  course  would  serve  the  best interests of the Air Force. 6.1.4.2.  For protecting the rights and benefits of employees who must relocate because of an emergency family situation. 6.1.4.3.  For  temporary  service  with  a  non-federal  or  private  enterprise  when  it  will contribute to the public welfare or when the experience to be gained will benefit the Air Force. AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   27  6.1.4.4.  For service with a recognized employee organization. 6.1.4.5.  For  protecting  an  employee’s  status  and  benefits  pending  final  action  by  the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on a claim for disability retirement, after all sick and annual leave have been exhausted. 6.1.4.6.  For recovery from illness or disability not of a permanent nature. 6.1.4.7.  For  protecting  the  rights  and  benefits  of  employees  who  request  to  remain  at home to care for a newborn, newly adopted, or sick minor child. 6.2.  Amount of LWOP.  There is no maximum prescribed by law or regulation on the amount of  LWOP  which  can  be  granted.    Costs  and  inconveniences  to  the  Air  Force  as  a  result  of granting  extended  LWOP  include  encumbrance  of  a  position,  loss  of  services,  complication  of retention registers in the event of reduction in force, obligation to provide active employment at the end of the approved leave period, credit of 6 months of each year towards retirement without employee  contributions,  eligibility  for  continued  coverage  under  FEGLI  (without  cost  to  the employee  for  up  to  1  year  of  non-pay  status),  and  payment  of  the  employer’s  share  of  health insurance premiums for LWOP up to 365 days. 6.3.  When  LWOP  is  Not  Granted.  LWOP  is  not  granted  to  an  employee  who  is  being returned from overseas at government expense for separation. 6.4.  Who  Approves  LWOP.  Supervisors  authorized  to  approve  annual  and  sick  leave determine  (subject  to  any  higher  administrative  approval  required  locally)  when  requests  for LWOP  for  1  year  or  less  may  be  granted.  LWOP  of  more  than  30  consecutive  days  must  be made  a  matter  of  record  in  the  Official  Personnel  Folder.  Supervisors  are  required  to  submit  a Request for Personnel Action (RPA) through the CPS to the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) or a SF 52, Request for Personnel Action, to the local CPS prior to granting LWOP of more than 30  days.  Initial  grants  of  LWOP  may  not  exceed  12  months.  If  an  additional  grant  is  deemed justified, the employee’s request for extension must be submitted to the installation commander or  designee  for  approval.  An  extension  beyond  1  year  may  be  approved  only  when  it  is  in  the interest of the federal service, or when it is determined that, because of unusual circumstances, the employee would be subjected to undue hardship if the extension were denied. (T-1) 6.5.  Absent-US  (formerly  LWOP-US).  Absent-US  is  leave  of  absence  to  perform  duty  with the uniformed services, in a pay or non-pay status. An employee does not have to be a Reservist or National Guardsman in order to be granted mandatory Absent-US. When civilian employees in the Reserve or the National Guard perform military duty, document all periods of Absent-US of at least one day's duration on the SF-50 including actions of 30 days or less. Effective day of Absent-US  will be the first day in  non-pay status. This  will enable personnel/payroll offices to have a record of military service deposits for retirement purposes and will entitle employees to make up contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). 6.6.  LWOP  for  Attendance  at  School  Functions.  Parents  are  authorized  up  to  24  hours  of LWOP  in  a  leave  year  for  participation  in  school  activities  directly  related  to  the  educational advancement of their children.  This includes, but is not limited to, parent-teacher conferences or meetings  with  child-care  providers,  interviewing  for  a  new  school  or  child-care  facility,  or participating in volunteer activities to support the child’s educational advancement.   28  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 Chapter 7 MILITARY LEAVE 7.1.  Military Leave Explained.  Military leave is absence from duty in the employee’s civilian position without loss of pay (including pay for regularly scheduled overtime) to perform military duty.  Eligible  employees  must,  upon  request,  be  granted  military  leave  to  which  entitled  for performance  of  active  duty,  active  duty  for  training,  or  inactive-duty  training  (as  defined  in section 101 of title 37). As a result of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), if an employee is ordered to an initial period of active duty for training  or  inactive-duty  training  with  the  Reserve  or  National  Guard,  the  employee  may  be granted  military  leave,  annual  leave,  previously-earned  compensatory  time  off,  previously-earned  credit  hours,  previously-earned  time-off  award,  or  Absent-US,  as  requested.  Military leave does not have to be exhausted first and may be intermingled with other appropriate types of leave  to  perform  military  duty.  However,  if  the  employee  (except  a  temporary  employee)  is  to continue on active duty for an extended period (usually more than 1 year), the employee must be placed in Absent-US status unless the employee elects to use other leave or freely and knowingly provides  written  notice  of  intent  not  to  return  to  a  position  of  employment  with  the  agency,  in which case the employee can be separated. (T-0) 7.2.  Eligibility Criteria.  Employees entitled to military leave must be: 7.2.1.  A member of a Reserve or National Guard component; (T-0) 7.2.2.  A full-time, part-time, or indefinite employee who does not have an intermittent work schedule; and (T-0) 7.2.3.  Serving in an appointment that is not limited to 1 year or less.  NOTE:  Although an employee  may  serve  longer  than  1  year  on  successive  temporary  appointments,  there  is  no eligibility until the employee serves under an appointment that is not limited to 1 year or less.   (T-0) 7.3.  Military  Leave  Entitlement.  An  eligible  full-time  employee  with  a  regularly  scheduled 40-hour workweek or 80-hour pay period who is a member in the Reserve of the armed forces or a member of the National Guard accrues 15 days/120 hours (15 days x 8 hours) of military leave each fiscal year. Eligible part-time or uncommon tours of duty employees earn an equivalent of three  workweeks  of  military  leave  each  fiscal  year  based  upon  their  schedule.  For  example, employees  with  a  53-hour  workweek  accrue  159  hours  of  military  leave  each  fiscal  year; employees with a 60-hour workweek accrue 180 hours, and employees with a 72-hour workweek accrue 216 hours of military leave. Any military leave (not to exceed 15 days/120 hours), which is unused at the end of a fiscal year, is carried forward to the next fiscal year and is available for use in addition to the days/hours credited for the new fiscal  year. This means that an employee may have a maximum of the equivalent of 30 days military leave available for use during a fiscal year. An employee, who is a member of the Reserve or National Guard who is not eligible for, or who  has  exhausted  his  or  her  military  leave,  must  be  granted  annual  leave,  previously-earned time off award, credit hours, or LWOP, as requested, in order to perform active or inactive duty for training. (T-0) An employee on military duty cannot use sick leave. Sick leave may only be used when orders are issued specifically for a member to receive medical treatment/exams/attend AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   29  a medical evaluation board or are incapacited for either military or civilian duty due to a line of duty incident. 7.3.1.  Part-Time  Military  Leave  Entitlement.  Part-time  career  or  career-conditional employees  who  are  on  a  regularly  scheduled  tour  of  duty  of  16  to  32  hours  a  week  accrue military leave at a rate determined by dividing 40 into the number of hours in the regularly scheduled workweek during the fiscal  year and  multiplying by 15.  (Example:   A regularly scheduled  part-time  employee  works  20  hours  per  week.    That  employee’s  entitlement  to military leave is 20 divided by 40 x 15.)  NOTE:  Part-time employees who work less than 16 hours per week are not entitled to military leave. 7.4.  How Military Leave Accumulates.  On 1 October of each fiscal year, or upon appointment into either the federal service or upon joining the Reserves or Air National Guard, whichever is later,  military  leave  is  credited  to  an  eligible  employee’s  account  (prorated  for  part-time employees).  Unused  military  leave  remaining  from  the  prior  fiscal  year,  not  to  exceed  15 days/120 hours, is also credited. 7.5.  Military  Leave  for  Law  Enforcement  Purposes.  When a member of the Reserve or the National  Guard  is  ordered  to  perform  full-time  active  duty  for  law  enforcement,  military  leave not  to  exceed 22 workdays in  a calendar  year is  authorized. The 22 workdays  are  converted to 176 hours and may be charged hourly. This military leave can be granted only for absence during the  employee’s  regularly  scheduled  tour  of  duty,  including  regularly  scheduled  overtime.  It cannot  be  granted  for  military  duty  performed  within  a  period  of  non-pay  status.  Under  the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5519, an employee’s civilian pay is reduced by the amount (other than a travel, transportation, or per diem allowance) received by the employee for military service as a member of the Reserve or National Guard for a period for which he/she is granted military leave under this provision. 7.6.  Military  Leave  for  Parades  or  Encampments.  Members  of  the  National  Guard  of  the District  of  Columbia  who  are  ordered  to  serve  during  a  parade  or  encampment  are  entitled  to unlimited military leave  for all days on which such duty  is  performed.    Any pay the employee receives while on military leave for parades or encampments (other than travel, transportation, or per diem allowance) will be credited against the pay received in the civilian position during the employee’s absence to perform the military duty. 7.7.  Conditions  for  Granting  Military  Leave.  An eligible employee is granted any available military leave, annual leave, previously-earned compensatory time off, previously-earned credit hours,  previously-earned  time  off  award,  or  Absent-US  when  they  perform  active  duty  or inactive duty. When an employee is on active duty, a copy of the orders normally accompanies the  request  for  military  leave.  Other  types  of  military  duty  may  be  approved  based  on  the employee’s  request.  Supervisors  may  request  additional  documentation.  The  employee  may  be required to submit documentation by the appropriate military official that the military duty was performed.  Normally,  Reserve  active  and  inactive  duty  is  planned  and  announced  in  advance. Employees are encouraged to provide, if possible, copies of annual training schedules as well as advance notice of specific training dates. 7.8.  How  Military  Leave  Is  Charged.  Military  leave  granted  is  charged  on  an  hourly  basis. Employees  will  not  be  charged  military  leave  for  non-duty  days  (typically  weekends  and holidays)  that  occur  within  the  period  of  military  service.  Employees  requesting  military  leave for active duty or inactive duty training (sometimes less than 8 hours) will be charged only the   30  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 amount of military leave necessary to cover the period of military duty or period of training and necessary travel. Hours in the civilian workday that are not chargeable to military leave must be worked  or  charged  to  another  leave  category,  as  appropriate.  No  charge  is  made  for  non-workdays at the beginning and end of a period of absence on active military duty. In addition, no leave is charged for the first day of the active duty tour if the employee is not required to report for military duty until after the civilian duty day ends, and no leave is charged for the last day of the active duty tour if the employee is completely released from active duty prior to the start of the  next  civilian  duty  day.  If  the  military  tour  or  consecutive  tours  is  completely  covered  by annual  leave,  Absent-US,  previously-earned  compensatory  time  off,  previously-earned  credit hours, or any combination thereof, military leave is not charged. (T-0) 7.8.1.  When  Used  for  Law  Enforcement.  Military  leave  granted  for  law  enforcement purposes  is  charged  on  all  days  the  employee  would  otherwise  have  worked  and  received pay,  including  days  on  which  the  employee  was  scheduled  to  work  overtime  on  a  regular basis.  No  charge  is  made  to  military  leave  for  holidays  or  for  any  other  day  established  by Executive or Administrative Order as a non-workday not chargeable to leave. Military leave for  employees  using  the  22  days  of  military  leave  granted  for  law  enforcement  purposes  is charged in units of hours. The 22 days of law enforcement leave are converted to 176 hours and charged on the same basis as annual and sick leave. For example, an employee with 22 additional days of military leave for law enforcement purposes works a 4-day workweek (10 hours  per  day),  Tuesday  through  Friday.  He  or  she  is  absent  Tuesday  and  Wednesday  to perform  law enforcement  duty. The  employee would  be charged 10 hours of military leave for law enforcement purposes on Tuesday and another 10 hours for Wednesday and have a balance  of  156  hours  remaining.  Under  the  provisions  of  5  U.S.C.  5519,  an  employee’s civilian  pay  is  reduced  by  the  amount  (other  than  a  travel,  transportation,  or  per  diem allowance)  received  by  the  employee  for  military  service  as  a  member  of  the  Reserve  or National  Guard  for  a  period  for  which  he  is  granted  military  leave  under  this  provision.  In short, an employee is entitled to the greater of his or her civilian or military pay, but not both. However,  an  employee  may  choose  to  take  annual  leave,  traditional  15-day  military  leave, accrued  credit  hours,  previously-earned  time  off  award,  or  accrued  compensatory  time  off instead of this type of military leave in order to retain both their full civilian and full military pay. 7.8.2.  When  Applied  to  Alternative  Work  Schedules.  Military  leave  for  employees  on alternative  work  schedules  accrues  at  the  same  rate  as  for  employees  on  fixed  work schedules, based on the number of hours worked per pay period. Employees working flexible or compressed work schedules of 80 hours per pay period accrue 120 hours of military leave each fiscal year. Military leave is still charged on an hourly basis. Ten hours of military leave will be charged for a full day of military duty on regularly scheduled 10-hour workdays, nine hours of military leave will be charged on regularly scheduled 9-hour workdays, etc. 7.8.3.  When  Applied  to  Active  Duty  Tours.  Federal  employees,  who  are  also  reservists including  Air  Reserve  Technicians  (ARTs)  who  are  on  Absent-US  while  serving  on  an extended  active  duty  (EAD)  tour  that  spans  2  or  more  fiscal  years,  accrue  120  hours  (or equivalent) of military leave at the beginning of the fiscal year. Reservists may use military leave at any time during the EAD tour or carry over up to 15 days as explained in paragraph 4.2. 7.9.  Other Types of Absences Related to Military Duty. AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   31  7.9.1.  Physical  Examinations  for  Duty  in  the  Armed  Forces.    An  employee  is  excused without charge to leave or loss of pay for the time required for physical examination before induction  or  recall  to  active  duty  in  the  armed  forces.  (The  term  induction  includes volunteering  for  military  service.)    An  absence  in  excess  of  1  day  requires  a  justifying statement  from  the  examining  station.  An  employee  that  is  required  to  report  for  periodic physical  examinations  for  retention  of  status  in  any  Reserve  component  or  the  National Guard is granted sick leave for the absence under regulations applicable to approval of sick leave for medical examination. 7.9.2.  Entry into the Armed Forces. An employee who reports for induction or is recalled to extended  active  duty  in  the  armed  forces  is  carried  in  a  leave  status  (military  leave,  annual leave, compensatory time off, credit hours, previously-earned time off award, or Absent-US) until the CPS is notified that the employee has been inducted or accepted for extended active duty, or if the employee is rejected, until the employee returns to duty or separation action is effective. A member of the Reserve or National Guard may request to use all military leave to which entitled before separation for military service. A Reservist called to active duty for training  to  satisfy  an  initial  military  obligation  of  at  least  6  months  in  conjunction  with  a Reserve  assignment  is  granted  a  leave  of  absence.  An  employee  not  eligible  for  military leave or who has exhausted his or her military leave may request to use any available annual leave,  previously-earned  compensatory  time  off,  previously-earned  time  off  award,  or Absent-US pending acceptance or rejection for military duty. 7.9.3.  Funeral  Honors  Duty.  An  employee  who  is  a  member  of  the  Reserve  or  National Guard may use military  leave to perform  military  “funeral honors duty”. Military  leave  for this purpose should be charged for all hours of the civilian duty day necessary to cover the funeral honors duty and necessary travel. 7.10.  Additional Leave for Military Technicians.  In addition to the military leave available as described above, military technicians are entitled to 44 additional workdays of military leave in a calendar year when on active duty without pay for participation in operations outside the United States,  its  territories,  and  possessions.  This  includes  participation  in  operations  outside  the United  States,  its  territories  and  possessions  but  controlled  by  a  technician  physically  located inside  the  United  States,  its  territories  or  possessions,  e.g.,  operating  unmanned  aerial  vehicles (UAV)  overseas  from  a  stateside  location.  The  active  duty  orders  must  cite  10  U.S.C.  12315, 12301(b),  or  12301(d)  to  be  eligible  for  this  entitlement.  The  44  workdays  are  converted  into hours and are charged on the same basis as annual leave. (Example: Military reserve technicians who work 80-hour pay periods (including those on flexible and compressed work schedules) are entitled to a maximum of 352 hours (8 x 44 = 352).) Those with uncommon tours of duty accrue the amount of authorized leave according to their work schedule. The 44 workdays or a portion thereof, cannot be carried over into the next calendar year. It is appropriate to use this leave on the  day  of  deployment  from  home  station,  any  intervening  stops  within  the  United  States,  its territories  and  possessions,  and  the  day  of  return  to  home  station  as  long  as  the  ultimate destination on the military orders is an overseas location and any intermediate destinations/stops are  part  of  the  continuing  mission.  In  order  to  receive  any  pay  for  a  civilian  non-workday,  a change to "active duty with pay" status is required. This requires use of a separate AF Form 938 for  each  period  of  conversion.  Changes  to  civilian  duty  status  on  workdays  during  the  same military tour are also authorized, and require either the use of a DD Form 1610, AF Form 3956, or AF Form 40A. Use of this military leave is at the employee's discretion. (T-0)   32  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 7.11.  Military  Leave  for  Mobilized  Federal  Civilian  Employees.  The  National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (Public Law 108-136), Section 1113, and 5 U.S.C. 6323 (b), added a new authority for use of the additional 22 days of military leave provided under this statute. Employees who are called or ordered to active duty in support of a contingency operation as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13) and are members of the Reserves or the National Guard are entitled to the additional 22 workdays of military leave per calendar year. This applies to military service performed on or after 24 November 2003. For payroll reporting purposes, this new type of leave will be coded as “LL”, just as the military leave for law enforcement purposes is coded. Under  the  provisions  of  5  U.S.C.  5519,  an  employee’s  civilian  pay  is  reduced  by  the  amount (other than a travel, transportation, or per diem allowance) received by the employee for military service  as  a  member  of  the  Reserve  or  National  Guard  for  a  period  for  which  the  employee  is granted military leave under this provision. In short, an employee is entitled to the greater of his or her civilian or military pay, but not both. However, an employee may choose to take annual leave, traditional 15-day military leave, accrued credit hours, previously-earned time off award, or  accrued  compensatory  time  off  instead  of  this  type  of  military  leave  in  order  to  retain  both their full civilian and full military pay. AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   33  Chapter 8 COURT LEAVE 8.1.  Court Leave Explained.  Court leave is leave of absence from duty without loss of pay or charge to annual leave to perform jury duty in a federal, state, or municipal court or to serve as a witness  for  the  United  States,  the  District  of  Columbia,  or  state  or  local  government.    This includes  absence  during  periods  of  regularly  scheduled  overtime  as  well  as  absence  during  the employee’s  regularly  scheduled  basic  workweek.    For  the  purpose  of  granting  court  leave,  a military court is considered the same as a federal court. 8.2.  Who  Is  Eligible.  A permanent  or temporary employee with  a regularly scheduled tour of duty (part-time or full-time) is eligible for court leave.  Employees serving on an intermittent or when-actually-employed basis are not eligible for court leave. 8.3.  Granting Court Leave.  Court leave is granted for absence during an employee’s regularly scheduled tour of duty including regularly scheduled overtime.  It can be granted only for those days  and  hours  the  employee  would  otherwise  be  in  a  pay  status.    An  employee  cannot  be granted court leave for jury or witness duty performed within a period of non-pay status.  If the employee’s absence is properly chargeable to court leave, the employee cannot elect to have the absence charged to annual leave.  If an employee is on annual leave when called for jury duty or witness service, court leave shall be substituted.  No charge shall be made to annual leave for the court service. (T-0) 8.3.1.  Jury  Duty.  Because  of  the  importance  of  trial  by  jury  as  an  American  system  of justice, it is Air Force policy not to request that an employee be excused from jury service on the  basis  of  Air  Force  employment,  except  in  cases  of  extreme  necessity.    Effective administration  of  court  leave  also  requires  the  exercise  of  good  judgment  in  order  to  avoid imposing  hardship  on  employees.  To  avoid  undue  hardship,  supervisors  should  adjust schedules for employees who work nights or weekends and are called to jury duty. If there is no  jury/witness  service,  there  is  no  court  leave.  If  the  employee  works  a  full,  regular  night shift, no court leave is charged, see paragraph 8.4 8.3.2.  Witness  Service.    Court  leave  is  granted  for  employees  who  are  summoned  as  a witness on behalf of any party in connection to any judicial proceeding to which the United States,  the  District  of  Columbia,  or  a  state  or  local  government  is  a  party.    NOTE:    An employee  who  is  summoned  by  the  courts  or  assigned  by  the  Air  Force  to  testify  in  an official  capacity  or  to  produce  official  records  on  behalf  of  any  party  in  any  judicial proceeding is performing official duty and is not entitled to court leave, but is in an official duty status for the time involved. 8.3.3.  Leave  for  Participation  in  Suits  Between  Private  Individuals  and  Companies.    Court suits  between  private  individuals  or  companies  in  which  the  United  States,  the  District  of Columbia, or a state or local government is not an involved party do not entitle employees to court  leave.  Therefore,  the  time  the  employee-plaintiff  spends  testifying  in  his  or  her  own behalf  does  not  meet  the  requirement  of  having  been  summoned;  therefore,  granting  court leave is not appropriate. 8.3.4.  Employee  as  Plaintiff  in  Suit  against  the  Government.    When  an  employee-plaintiff has been deposed (called to give a deposition) or otherwise summoned to testify in a case in   34  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 which a party in the proceeding is the United States, the District of Columbia, or a state or local government, the employee-plaintiff is a “witness” and is entitled to court leave for the time involved in giving a deposition or being a witness.  When an employee is a party in a suit against the government, the time the employee-plaintiff spends in preparation for the trial and  answering  the  government’s  interrogatories,  as  well  as  the  time  spent  observing  the conduct of the trial do not qualify as court leave.  Annual leave or LWOP is appropriate for such periods.  However, if and when the employee-plaintiff prevails in a civil action against the government which is related to or caused by a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, then the employee is entitled to restoration of leave charged. 8.3.5.  Testimony in Title VII Proceedings.  In a proceeding involving the Air Force or other Federal agency under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, federal employees are in an official  duty  status  when  they  appear  as  witnesses  or  are  required  to  provide  sworn statements.  Witnesses  who  are  Air  Force  employees  and  who  are  summoned  to  testify  on behalf of the plaintiff in a civil action under Title VII against the Air Force are entitled to the same  benefits  with  respect  to  pay  status  while  attending  court  as  persons  who  testify  on behalf of the Air Force.  Similarly, Air Force employees who are plaintiffs in such cases are entitled  to  official  time  for  attendance  in  court  at  their  trial.    These  entitlements  flow  from Title  VII,  which  takes  precedence  over  any  contrary  provision  of  any  collective  bargaining agreement or other regulation. 8.4.  Return to Duty Upon Release by Court.  An employee properly summoned by a state or federal court to serve on a jury is under the jurisdiction and control of the court for  the term of the jury service.  However, an  employee is  expected to  return to  duty during periods when the employee is excused from jury duty unless this would be impractical.  An employee excused or discharged by the court either for an indefinite period in excess of 1 day or a substantial portion thereof, is not entitled to court leave, but must report to duty.  As a general rule, if there are 4 or more  hours  remaining  in  the  employee’s  workday,  exclusive  of  reasonable  travel  time,  the employee  should  report  for  duty.    If  the  employee  fails  to  report  for  duty  as  directed,  annual leave,  previously-earned  compensatory  time  off,  LWOP,  or  AWOL  is  charged  for  the  excess time involved. (T-0) 8.5.  Procedure  for  Recording  Court  Leave.  When an employee is called for jury or witness duty, the court order, subpoena, summons, or official request is given to the supervisor as soon as possible. The days and hours of court leave are entered on the OPM 71 or approved automated timekeeping system. When the employee returns to duty, the employee submits written evidence of  attendance  in  court  showing  the  dates  and  hours,  if  possible.  If  required,  the  supporting documents are forwarded to the payroll office with the time and attendance report that includes the court leave entry. 8.6.  Witness  and  Jury  Fees  and  Expenses.  An  employee  is  entitled  to  receive  and  retain expenses  paid  for  services  rendered  and  reimbursement  for  travel  expenses.    When  a  state  or local  court  characterizes  jury  and  witness  fees  as  expenses,  there  is  no  requirement  for  the employee to turn in such fees to the agency.  The employee cannot retain fees received in most circumstances. fees  and expenses/allowances.  Fees received by the employee are collected while the expenses are not.  If the certificate of attendance does not identify expenses separately, all monies are considered fees and shall be collected. (T-0) The employee must submit fees received for jury or witness services by  money  order  or  personal  check  to  the  servicing  DFAS  office.    The  employee  may  keep   The  certificate  of  attendance  should  separately identify AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   35  reimbursements  for  expenses  received  from  the  court,  authority,  or  party  that  caused  the employee to be summoned and may keep fees that exceed the employee’s compensation for the days of service.  An employee serving on a jury in a state or local court who waives or refuses to accept  fees  is  still  liable  to  the  U.S.  Government  for  the  fees  he  or  she  would  have  received.  Fees  not  submitted  in  a  timely  manner  are  subject  to  payroll  deduction.    Payroll  deductions  to collect  the fees will be made in  the next  regular pay period.   If fees are  erroneously paid  to  an employee by the court, the fees paid cannot be retained by the employee and must be turned in to the employing activity.  When a holiday occurs during the time an employee is on jury duty or witness service, the employee can keep the jury duty or witness service fee for the holiday.  If an employee is called to jury duty on a non-workday, or during a non-pay status, the employee may keep the fees paid. (T-0)   36  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 Chapter 9 ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP DISMISSAL 9.1.  Administrative Group Dismissal.  Administrative group dismissal is an absence from duty when employees are released from duty because all or part of an activity is closed, or it is in the public  interest.  Employees  affected  by  these  actions  are  generally  excused  without  charge  to leave and without loss of pay. 9.2.  Closing  an  Activity.  The  installation  commander,  commanders  of  combatant  commands, and lead commanders designated in areas with more than one activity, are authorized to close all or part of an activity and to excuse employees administratively.  This authority does not extend to  periods  of  interrupted  or  suspended  operations  that  can  be  anticipated  enough  in  advance  to permit arranging for assignment to other work or the scheduling of annual leave. 9.2.1.  It is Air Force policy that during adverse weather conditions or other emergencies that result in the regular worksite being closed or closed to the public, telework ready employees, i.e., those on a signed telework agreement, will work from their approved alternate worksites.  This  means  that  telework-ready  employees  who  are  permitted  to  use  unscheduled  telework are  required  to  telework  on  closure  days.  This  includes  employees  who  are  regularly scheduled to telework on the day of a closure and those who were not scheduled in advance to telework but  are required to do so by virtue of their telework agreement (i.e., employees who will telework only on an occasional, situational basis).  Supervisors are responsible for ensuring employees are aware of this policy. (T-3) 9.2.1.1.  All  Air  Force  employees’  telework  agreements  on  the  DD  Form  2946  contain the requirement to “telework for the duration of an emergency pursuant to: 1) Component policy; 2) a pandemic; 3) when the regular worksite is closed or closed to the public due to natural or manmade emergency situations (e.g., snowstorm, hurricane, act of terrorism, etc.); or 4) when Government offices are open with the option for unscheduled telework when  weather  conditions  make  commuting  hazardous,  or  similar  circumstances compromise employee safety.” 9.2.2.  Employees who  are not  on  a signed telework agreement, or who  are prevented from working  at  their telework site due to unforeseen  circumstances (e.g., power failure), during an emergency follow local procedures for reporting and dismissal and are not charged leave when dismissal.  9.2.3. Employees cannot be required to enter into a telework agreement, even if some or all of the duties of the position can be performed at an alternative location. administartive an there is 9.3.  Authority  to  Grant  Absence  Due  to  Emergency  Conditions  or  for  Managerial Reasons.  The  installation  commander  may  issue  administrative  orders  as  prescribed  in  DoD 1400.25-M,  DoD  Civilian  Personnel  Manual,  Subchapter  610,  Hours  of  Duty  and  Subchapter 630, Leave relieving employees: 9.3.1.  For managerial reasons (e.g., worksite maintenance). 9.3.2.  When emergency conditions exist. 9.3.3.  When normal operations are interrupted by events beyond the control of management or employees. AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   37  9.3.4.  When it is in the public interest to relieve employees from duty. 9.4.  Group Dismissal.  When normal operations of an activity are interrupted by events beyond the control of management or employees, employees (except certain temporary wage employees) may  be  excused  or  their  absence  charged  to  available  annual  leave.    The  authority  to  excuse employees under administrative dismissal orders is used sparingly and only for short periods of time.  Per  DoDI  1400.25-V610,  DoD  Civilian  Personnel  Management  System:  Hours  of  Duty, employees will be notified as far in advance as possible but no less than 3 full work days, when circumstances permit, that they will be placed in a leave status.   In lieu of leave, the employee may  use  compensatory  time  earned,  credit  hours  earned,  or  LWOP,  or  the  employee  may telework  in  accordance  with  their  approved  telework  agreement.    In  arriving  at  a  decision  to close all or part of an activity, the commander should: 9.4.1.  Consider the practice of private employers in the community. 9.4.2.  Provide  for  liberal  use  of  annual  and  sick  leave  in  individual  cases.  For  example, before  considering  any  group  dismissal  because  of  temperature  extremes,  grant  leave  to employees with  chronic  medical  conditions,  which, according to  the written advice of their attending health care provider, could be aggravated by temperature extremes. 9.4.3.  Group  dismissal  should  be  rare  and  authorized  only  when  conditions  are  severe  or normal  operations  would  be  significantly  disrupted.  Assure  that  group  dismissals  of employees in connection with extreme weather conditions are authorized only in exceptional instances  where  working  or  commuting  conditions  are  unusually  severe  and  health  of employees is endangered. 9.4.4.  Group dismissals will normally not exceed 3 consecutive workdays in a single period. When  approving  group  dismissals,  commanders  or  heads  of  activities  must  consider  the practices of private employers in the area, the use of unscheduled leave in individual cases, and  the  severity  of  working  or  commuting  conditions.  In  those  rare  cases  when  group dismissal  is  approved  beyond  3  consecutive  workdays,  the  administrative  order  must document  why  other  alternatives  could  not  be  used  and  the  reason(s)  for  the  length  of  the anticipated dismissal. (T-1) 9.4.5.  Group  dismissal  authority  may  not  be  used  to  create  a  holiday  or  as  a  reward  for performance. For example, it must not be used to grant a “day off” for the Friday following Thanksgiving  or  in  conjunction  with  any  other  holiday,  or  a  family/down  day,  or  training day, commensurate with those granted for active duty military members. (T-1) 9.4.6.  Supervisors  are  responsible  for  ensuring  employees  understand  procedures  for employee  notification  during  emergencies  and  late  arrival/early  release  practices  including policies  for  approving  absences,  and  identify  emergency  employees  who  are  expected  to report for or remain at work in emergency situations unless otherwise notified. (T-1) 9.5.  Absence Due to Environmental Conditions.  Dismissals due to environmental conditions, which  cause  an  adverse  work  environment  such  as  temperature  extremes  and  plumbing  and lighting malfunctions, should be rare.  These  conditions  must be corrected as soon as possible.  Employees  are  expected  to  work  if  conditions  of  the  workplace  are  reasonably  adequate.  Individual employees affected by environmental conditions may be granted leave.  Management should consider alternate work sites.  Before administrative excusal may be granted, it must be clearly  established  by  reasonable  standards  of  judgment  that  the  conditions  are  such  as  to   38  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 actually  prevent  working.    When  early  dismissal  is  authorized,  affected  employees  in  a  duty status at the time set for dismissal are excused without charge to leave.  For employees who are scheduled  to  report  for  duty  after  an  initial  period  of  leave,  and  dismissal  is  given  before  the employee  can  report,  leave  is  charged  until  the  time  set  for  dismissal.    Employees  who  leave before the scheduled dismissal time, or who are already in a leave status and scheduled to be in a leave status during the time of dismissal, continue to be charged leave. (T-1) 9.6.  Absence  Due  to  Hazardous  Weather  Conditions  or  Disasters.  Group  dismissals  of employees  without  charge  to  leave  because  of  severe  storm,  snow  or  icing  conditions,  or disasters  occurring  during  or  outside  regular  duty  hours  may  be  authorized  in  accordance  with the  guidelines  in  DoD  1400.25-M.    These  guidelines  must  be  followed  by  installation commanders  in  making  group  dismissal  determinations.    To  ensure  orderly  evacuation  of employees  who  can  be  released  from  duty,  and  continued  maintenance  of  essential  operations, establish  local  procedures  for  official  notification  of  group  dismissals  to  all  activities  and  the designation of those functions which must continue to  be manned under all weather conditions for reasons of health, safety, and national security.  In geographical areas (defined as areas within which  employees  normally  commute  to  work)  where  the  conditions  affect  more  than  one Defense  activity,  the  commander  of  the  activity  employing  the  largest  number  of  civilian employees  must  make  the  determination  if  an  emergency  exists  and  assess  its  impact  on  the employees, using the guidelines in DoD 1400.25-M.  Decisions by other individual commanders within the geographical area at variance with the decision of the major geographical commander must be coordinated with the latter. Group dismissal announcements for  Air Force activities in the  Washington  DC  area  are  controlled  by  procedures  developed  by  OPM.  (T-0)  Under  group dismissal conditions, employees are excused or charged leave as follows: 9.6.1.  Early Dismissal.  Only employees who are in a duty status (not on leave), or who are expected to  return from  leave to  duty status  at  the time the early dismissal  takes effect,  are excused without charge to leave.  Employees who are absent on leave that day continue to be charged leave. 9.6.1.1.  Employees  on  approved  telework  agreements  are  expected  to  work  their  full duty day. 9.6.2.  Late Reporting.  Depending on hazardous weather conditions, tardiness not in excess of 2 hours may be excused.  Tardiness in excess of 2 hours may also be excused because of an unavoidable delay resulting from adverse weather or from disruption of public or private transportation in individual cases which are personally reviewed by appropriate supervisors.  In case of employees who do not report for duty during hazardous weather, annual leave is charged  for  the  full  duty  day,  unless  the  supervisor  concerned  determines,  after  personal review  of  the  facts  in  each  case,  that  the  employee  made  every  reasonable  effort  to  get  to work,  but  was  unable  to  do  so  because  of  the  weather  conditions.    Determining  factors  for consideration in the decision include:  Distance between the employee’s residence and place of work, and mode of transportation. 9.6.2.1.  Employees  on  approved  telework  agreements  are  expected  to  begin  their  duty day at the regularly scheduled time. 9.6.3.  Base Closure. Workdays in which federal activities are closed for hazardous weather conditions  or  disasters  are  non-workdays  for  employees  not  on  a  approved  telework agreement or in an approved leave status. All regular employees who are not on an approved AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   39  telework  agreement  or  in  an  approved  leave  status  are  excused  without  charge  to  leave. Employees  who  are  absent  on  leave  that  day  continue  to  be  charged  leave.    Teleworking employees  are  expected  to  follow  their  approved  telework  agreement.  Employees  with mission essential duties are expected to perform those duties or request leave.  Employees in a non-pay/LWOP status on the days immediately before and after the day(s) the activity was closed will remain in a non-pay/LWOP status. In addition, it does not apply to employees on military duty or suspension on the day of the closure. Employees who are assigned to other activities but are TDY at the closed activity are entitled to excusal without charge to leave. Employees  assigned  to  the  affected  activity  but  are  TDY  elsewhere,  are  not  entitled  to excusal without charge to leave. 9.6.3.1.  For  an  employee  who  has  scheduled  annual  or  sick  leave,  that  leave  may  be cancelled if the employee is ready, willing, and able to telework (telework-ready with a telework  agreement  in  place)  and  agrees  to  perform  telework  in  lieu  of  the  scheduled leave. 9.7.  Shutdowns in Private Plants. 9.7.1.  Labor  Disputes  in  Private  Plants.    When  employees  are  prevented  from  working because  of  temporary  shutdowns  due  to  labor  disputes  at  a  private  plant  to  which  they  are assigned,  every  effort  must  be  made  to  assign  them  to  other  work.    If  that  is  not  possible, such employees may be dismissed without charge to leave for a maximum of 5 days. (T-1) 9.7.2.  Planned  Shutdowns  in  Private  Plants.    When  private  plants  are  to  close  based  on  a planned  shutdown  such  as  Christmas  or  other  scheduled  holiday  period,  employees  should not be dismissed without charge to leave, but should be carried in an appropriate leave status, i.e., annual leave, previously-earned compensatory time off, credit hours earned or LWOP. 9.8.  Emergency Situations Occurring During the Workday. 9.8.1.  When  an  activity  remains  open  and  employees  are  expected  to  complete  the  day’s tour,  they  may  be  granted  use  of  annual  leave,  credit  hours,  compensatory  time  earned,  or LWOP. 9.8.2.  When  the  activity  closes  and  employee  leaves  after  receiving  official  word  of  the pending  dismissal  but  before  the  time  set  for  dismissal  (with  supervisory  approval)  in  a situation not involving a hardship, annual leave, credit hours, compensatory time earned, or LWOP may be charged as appropriate for the period remaining until the employee’s official departure time (i.e., the authorized dismissal time). 9.8.3.  Emergency-essential  employees  who  do  not  report  for  work  as  required  may  be charged  annual  leave,  sick  leave,  credit  hours,  compensatory  timed  earned,  LWOP,  or AWOL if appropriate. 9.8.4.  Non-emergency essential employees who are scheduled to report for work before the dismissal but who don’t report should be granted use of leave, compensatory time earned, or credit hours or charged AWOL, if appropriate, for the entire workday. Use of annual leave, credit  hours,  compensatory  time  earned,  or  LWOP  may  be  granted,  or  AWOL  may  be charged,  if  appropriate,  to  employees  who  leave  before  official  notice  of  dismissal  for  the period remaining until the end of the regular workday.   40  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 9.8.5.  When  an  employee  was  scheduled  to  return  from  leave  during  the  dismissal  period, the supervisor should continue to charge leave for the absence until the time set for dismissal, then charge any continuing absence due to the emergency in the same manner as absences of other employees who were on duty at the time of dismissal. 9.8.6.  Employees  on  LWOP  pending  disability  retirement  or  while  in  receipt  of  Workers’ Compensation, on military leave, suspension, or in a non-pay status the workday before and after a closure shall be continued in that status. (T-0) AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   41  Chapter 10 ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE 10.1.  Administrative  leave.  There  are  numerous  instances  when  employees  are  absent  from their  normal  assignments  to  perform  acts  or  services  officially  sanctioned  by  management.  In performing  these  acts  or  services,  employees  remain  under  management  control  or  jurisdiction and  are  considered  to  be  in  a  duty  status.  Supervisors  are  authorized  to  make  individual determinations  that  the  act  or  service  is  job-related  and  not  chargeable  to  leave  and  to  place reasonable limits on the length of such absences from normal assignments. Administrative leave is an administratively authorized absence from duty without loss of pay or charge to leave. The leave approving supervisor may excuse employees only for the periods and the reasons specified in  this  chapter.  The  installation  commander  or  head  of  serviced  organizations  is  authorized  to excuse  employees  for  brief  periods  for  any  other  reasons  that  are  deemed  to  be  in  the  best interest  of  the  public  or  the  Air  Force.  Heads  of  serviced  organizations  are  those  individuals whose  activity  is  not  located  on  an  Air  Force  installation  or  are  a  separate  Air  Force  agency. Tenant  commanders  are  not  heads  of  serviced  organizations.  A  “brief  period”  normally  means not more than 4 hours per day. Administrative leave differs from administrative dismissal in that it  normally  addresses  individual  employees  being  excused  for  non-mission  related  emergency reasons, or for reasons the government encourages such as voting. (See Chapter 9 for guidance on group dismissal.) 10.1.1.  Employees  seeking  to  participate  in  installation  or  command  sponsored  team  and morale  building  events  may  be  excused  for  brief  periods  to  attend  such  events  subject  to mission  needs  and  workload.  Administrative  leave  is  not  authorized  for  local  organization and club social activities (e.g., food drives or sporting events). 10.1.2.  Commanders may assign employees to an alternative duty location for organizational activities requiring extended absence. 10.1.3.  Management  officials  may  not  use  administrative  leaves  or  dismiss  employees  in  a manner that effectively creates a paid non-duty day without charge to leave. Commanders or supervisors should approve requests for annual leave on Air Force family days. Family days are those days connected to Federal holidays when military personnel are usually given the day off. 10.1.4.  Administrative  leave  is  not  authorized  for  non-duty  periods  or,  as  in  the  case  of ARTs  for  the  purposes  of  accomplishing  military  requirements  or  military  training,  (e.g., haircuts or chemical defense training). 10.2.  Emergency  Rescue  or  Protective  Work.  An  employee  who  can  be  spared,  without interference to essential operations or obligations, may be excused to participate as a volunteer in emergency  rescue  or  protective  work  during  an  emergency  such  as  fire,  flood,  or  search operations.  Normally,  such  participation  is  limited  to  a  maximum  of  5  days  per  year.    An employee  cannot  be  excused  from  duty  without  charge  to  leave  for  the  purpose  of  performing rescue,  Reserve,  or  National  Guard  duty  which  would  otherwise  be  covered  by  military  leave.  Employees engaged in protective services, e.g., community “volunteer” firefighting (paid or not paid) would not qualify for administrative leave, but may be granted annual leave, LWOP, etc.   42  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 10.2.1.  Employees called to emergency duty as members of the Civil Air Patrol, or a similar organization, are excused without charge to leave. After 5 workdays, any further absence is normally  charged  to  available  annual  leave,  previously-earned  time-off  award,  previously-earned compensatory time off, or LWOP as requested by the employee. 10.2.2.  Except  as  authorized  above,  employees  assisting  in  local  community  emergency response,  emergency  search  and  rescue,  or  cleanup  in  the  aftermath,  are  charged  leave  or carried in a non-pay status for the total period of absence. 10.3.  Absence  for  Brief  Periods  or  Tardiness.  Unavoidable  absences,  brief  periods  of  early dismissal, and brief periods of tardiness of less than 1 hour may be excused by the supervisor or he or she may provide the employee opportunity to request approved leave, earned credit hours, or  previously-earned  compensatory  time  off.    If  the  absence  or  tardiness  is  charged  to  annual leave, the charge is in multiples of one quarter hour.  If the leave charged exceeds the period of absence  or  tardiness,  the  employee  is  not  required  to  work  the  additional  time  covered  by  the leave charge.  Unauthorized absence during the workday also may  be charged as AWOL if the circumstances do not justify excusing the absence or approving leave.  The charge of AWOL is not, itself, a disciplinary action. However, tardiness or an unauthorized absence that is charged to AWOL  may  serve  as  the  basis  for  disciplinary  action.    Such  cases  should  be  discussed  with representatives of the CPS to determine whether to take disciplinary action and what type. 10.4.  Absence for Voting or Registration.  Activities should assemble and maintain up-to-date information as to voting hours in all political subdivisions in which their employees reside.  This information should be made available to employees.  On the basis of this information, activities must determine the amount of administrative leave to be permitted and must  inform employees of these determinations. (T-1) 10.4.1.  As a general rule, employees requesting time off to vote are excused without charge to leave for the amount of time necessary to permit them to report to work 3 hours after the polls  open  or  to  leave  work  3  hours  before  the  polls  close,  whichever  requires  the  least amount of time off.  Normally, where the polls are open either 3 hours before or 3 hours after the  employee’s  regular  duty  hours,  no  time  off  is  granted.    (This  is  the  case  in  most jurisdictions.)  Employees on flexible work schedules may be excused only  for those hours which cannot be accommodated by their flexible schedule. 10.4.2.  Because  of  special  circumstances,  the  general  rule  stated  above  may  not  permit sufficient  time  for  voting,  in  which  case  the  employee  is  excused  for  the  additional  time necessary, but not more than 1 workday. 10.4.3.  Where  the  employee’s  voting  place  is  beyond  normal  commuting  distance,  and voting by absentee ballot is not permitted, the employee is granted sufficient time off to make the  trip.    Time  off  in  excess  of  1  day  is  charged  to  annual  leave,  previously-earned compensatory time off, or LWOP. 10.4.4.  The  employee  voting  in  jurisdictions  where  registration  in  person  is  required  is granted time off to register on substantially the same basis as for voting.  However, no time off  is  granted  without  charge  to  leave  if  the  employee  can  register  on  a  non-workday  and round-trip travel reasonably can be accomplished in 1 day. 10.4.5.  Where a collective bargaining agreement allow for more time than provided above, the agreement governs for all employees covered by it. AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   43  10.5.  Blood  Donations.  The Air Force encourages its employees to volunteer as blood donors without compensation.  An employee should be excused from work without charge to leave for the  time  necessary  to  donate  blood  or  blood  products,  such  as  platelets  or  plasma,  for recuperation  following  blood  donation,  and  for  necessary  travel  to  and  from  the  donation  site.  The  maximum  excusable  time  should  not  exceed  4  hours,  except  in  unusual  cases.    When  the employee  must  travel  a  long  distance  or  when  unusual  need  for  recuperation  occurs,  up  to  an additional 4 hours may be authorized.  This does not cover an employee who gives blood for the employee’s own use or receives compensation for giving blood.  Employees who volunteer but are  rejected  as  donors  for  that  visit  must  return  to  duty  or  elect  paid  leave,  but  may  still  use administrative leave for the time actually missed. (T-0) 10.6.  Examinations  and  Documentations  Required  as  a  Condition  of  Employment.  An employee  required  to  take  an  examination  or  obtain  documentation  as  a  condition  of employment, or to take a career field certification, is considered on official duty and no leave is charged  for  time  required  to  take  the  examination  or  obtain  documentation.  Absence  to  take examinations  other  than  those  specified  above  is  charged  to  annual  leave,  previously-earned compensatory time off, or LWOP. (T-0) 10.7.  Consultation  With  Operating  Officials,  EEO  Counselor,  Civilian  Personnel  Employment Interviews.  Do not charge an employee leave: 10.7.1.  For the time required to consult with operating officials, EEO Counselor, or the staff of the CPS on matters relating to their employment provided that arrangements satisfactory to the employee’s supervisor and the official to be consulted are made in advance. 10.7.2.  While  representing  a  labor  organization,  if  use  of  official  time  is  authorized  by management  pursuant  to  an  applicable  collective  bargaining  agreement.    Official  time  for union-related  representational  activities  will  be  recorded  as  required  by  appropriate directives. 10.7.3.  Who  is  specifically  requested  to  report  for  an  interview  in  connection  with  an application  or  referral  through  the  centralized  referral  system  for  a  position  at  the  same activity  is  not  charged  leave  for  the  time  required  for  the  interview.    If  the  interview  is  at another Air Force activity, within the local commuting area, leave is not charged for the time required  to  make  the  trip  for  the  interview.    This  also  applies  when  competition  is  for  a position within the Department of Defense. 10.7.4.  When  an  individual  is  employed  by  an  activity  scheduled  for  closure  or  major reduction  or  under  notice  of  separation  or  change  to  lower  grade  for  any  reason,  except personal cause, may be excused without charge to leave for any placement interview.  Such a placement  interview  may  be  with  another  federal  agency,  a  local  organization,  or  a  private business concern in the commuting area.  Except as provided above, absence for placement interviews is charged to annual leave, previously-earned compensatory time off, or LWOP. 10.8.  Medical  Examination  for  Federal  Service.  An  employee  required  to  take  a  medical examination to determine the employee’s fitness for the federal service, or who obtains chest x-rays  or  similar  medical  services  administered  as  part  of  the  health  program  at  the  activity,  is considered  in  duty  status  during  the  time  necessary  to  obtain  the  examination  or  treatment.  When  an  employee is  absent  because  of  administratively  required  vaccinations  or immunizations, the absence is considered an administrative leave without charge to leave or loss   44  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 of pay, provided the medical officer administering the vaccinations or immunizations certifies to the necessity for the absence. 10.9.  Attending  Meetings  and  Conferences:  Absence,  including  required  travel  time,  during normal  duty  hours  to  attend  meetings  or  conferences  determined  to  be  training,  or  absence  to attend other meetings for which travel is authorized at government expense, is considered official duty and no charge is made to leave. 10.9.1.  When spouses, who are also Air Force civilian employees, attend conferences as the official escort/guest  of  a military or  civilian official, administrative leave is  not  appropriate and leave must be charged. (T-1) 10.9.2.  Except  as  provided  in  paragraphs  10.9.4  and  10.9.5,  employees  may  be  excused  to attend conferences or conventions at no expense to the government when it is determined that such attendance is in the best interest of the federal service.  An administrative leave of this type  must  be  limited  to  those  situations  where  the  employee  is  an  official  representative  of the  organization  involved  or  an  active,  scheduled  participant  in  the  program,  and  must  be limited to 5 work days per calendar year. (T-0) 10.9.3.  Officers  or  delegates  of  an  association  of  management  officials  or  supervisors  with which  an  official  consultative  relationship  has  been  established  may  be  excused  to  attend conventions of the association. 10.9.4.  Guidance concerning the excusal of employees in connection with activities of labor organizations,  including  attendance  at  their  conventions  and  at  training  conferences sponsored by them, is contained in AFI 36-701, Labor Management Relations. 10.9.5.  Employees  shall  not  be  excused  to  attend  conferences  or  conventions  of  political parties  or  partisan  political  groups  or  committees.  However,  leave  may  be  granted  in  cases where administrative leave is not appropriate. (T-0) 10.9.6.  Employees  on  permissive  temporary  duty  (TDY)  orders  are  considered  to  in  an official duty status and will not be charged leave while on orders. 10.10.  Holiday Observance: 10.10.1.  Federal  Holidays. Employees are not  required to  work, or take leave, on a  federal holiday  unless  their  services  are  required  to  carry  out  essential  operations.  However, unauthorized  absence  on  a  holiday  on  which  the  employee  was  assigned  to  work  results  in loss of holiday premium pay for that day, and could result in disciplinary action. 10.10.2.  Holidays  and  Annual  Premium  Pay.  The  following  applies  to  employees  receiving annual  premium  pay  under  5  U.S.C.  5545(c)  (1)  and  firefighters  covered  by  the  Federal Firefighters Overtime Pay Reform Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-277), effective 11 Oct 98. The use of administrative  leave  is  not  appropriate  for  employees  receiving  annual  premium  pay  under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c) (1) and firefighters covered by  the Federal  Firefighters  Overtime Pay Reform Act. These employees who are absent on holidays, which occur within their regular tours of duty, must be charged leave for those absences. They are not entitled to holiday time off because they receive  a  type  of  premium  pay  that  includes  pay  for  holidays.  When  such  an  employee  is scheduled to work on a holiday and the employee is granted the day off for personal reasons, the employee is charged annual leave, previously-earned compensatory time off, LWOP, sick leave, etc., as appropriate. (T-0) AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   45  10.10.3.  Religious  Observance.  There  are  no  official  observances  of  religious  holidays outside  of  established  federal  holidays.    Insofar  as  practicable,  allow  employees  wishing  to observe religious holidays time off for that purpose and charge the absence to annual leave, previously-earned  compensatory  time  off,  religious  compensatory  time,  or  LWOP.  If circumstances  permit,  work  schedules  may  be  rearranged  to  provide  substituted  work  time. An  employee  may  also  request  to  perform  compensatory  overtime  work  for  the  purpose  of compensatory time off, in lieu of annual leave when the employee’s personal religious beliefs require  absence  from  work  during  certain  periods  of  the  workday  and/or  workweek.    An employee may work religious  compensatory time before or after the grant of compensatory time off. The advanced compensatory time off should be repaid within a reasonable time. An unliquidated  advance  religious  compensatory  balance  is  collected  at  the  time  of  separation, except death, from compensatory balances, if available, or annual leave, or both. 10.10.4.  State  and  Local  Holidays.  State  and  local  holidays,  including  local  holidays  in foreign areas, are treated as regular  workdays, unless all or part of the activity is  closed by administrative order because employees are actually prevented from working due to lack of transportation  services,  eating  facilities,  etc.  Employees  in  activities  so  closed  cannot  be charged  leave  for  absence  on  that  day.  This  applies  to  employees  on  previously  scheduled annual or sick leave as well as to those who would have been present for duty had the activity remained open.  However, employees working on such a day receive only their regular pay and  are  not  entitled  to  holiday  premium  pay.  When  the  activity  remains  open,  as  many employees  as  possible  are  allowed  to  take  leave  on  the  holiday,  depending  on  the  type  of operation, the workload, and the significance of the holiday. 10.11.  Off-the-Job Training During Regularly Scheduled Duty Hours: 10.11.1.  No charge is made to leave for off-the-job training whether conducted on or off the installation  which  is  approved  under  AFI  36-401,  Employee  Training  and  Development,  as directly related to the employee’s present official duties, or those which the employee could reasonably be expected to perform in the future, and which is paid for from Air Force funds. 10.11.2.  No charge is made to leave for off-the-job training whether conducted on or off the installation  which  is  approved  under  AFI  36-401,  Employee  Training  and  Development  as directly  related  to  the  employee/veteran’s  present  official  duties  or  those  which  the employee/veteran could reasonably be expected to perform in the future, when the training is approved  and  paid  under  38  U.S.C.  1781,  Veterans’  Administration  educational  assistance allowance or when the employee/veteran pays all expenses of such training. 10.11.3.  Training  taken  by  an  employee  on  personal  initiative  for  personal  advancement must  either  be  taken  outside  of  scheduled  duty  hours,  as  credit  hours,  or  during  periods  of approved  leave  or  LWOP.    (See  AFI  36-807,  Weekly  and  Daily  Scheduling  of  Work  and Holiday Observances for variations of work schedules for educational purposes.) (T-2) 10.11.4.  Mission-related  courses  approved  for  Air  Force  funded  tuition  assistance  will normally  be  taken  on  a  voluntary  off-duty  basis.    Such  courses  may  be  taken  during  duty hours subject to approval by the employee’s supervisor. 10.11.5.  Employees  who  are  assigned  to  an  educational  institution  on  long-term  training (LTT) must report any leave usage (i.e., annual, sick or other leave) to his/her supervisor or leave-approving  official  at  their  home  duty  station  for  accurate  recording.  Leave  requests   46  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 should be submitted to the seminar leader or course instructor and or other appropriate form, forwarded  to  the  person  maintaining  the  employee’s  leave  record  at  their  home  station. Before departing for LTT, an employee should make arrangements to use annual leave that may otherwise be lost because of training. Due to the nature of the assignment, leave will be approved  only  during  Thanksgiving,  Christmas  and  spring  breaks;  emergency  leave  is approved throughout the LTT, as needed. During extended periods in which the school is in recess (e.g., Christmas holidays and spring break), the employee is required to be on leave or returned to a duty status at an organization at the training location, the nearest Air Force, Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve activity. For Air Force sponsored courses (e.g., PME) taken  to  enhance  civilian  employment  performance,  employees  may  be  excused  without charge to leave to provide time to study, take exams, conduct research, etc. (T-1) 10.12.  Funerals. 10.12.1.  An  Air  Force  civilian  employee  may  be  excused  for  a  brief  period  to  attend  the funeral of an Air Force civilian co-worker, reservist or military member. 10.12.2.  An  Air  Force  civilian  employee  who  is  a  veteran  of  the  armed  forces  and  who participates as a pallbearer, a member of a gun firing salute team, or a member of an honor guard  in  funerals  for  members  of  the  armed  forces  who  lost  their  lives  on  active  duty  is excused  from  duty  without  charge  to  leave,  but  not  in  excess  of  4  hours  in  1  day.  An employee  is  excused  for  not  more  than  3  days  to  make  arrangements  for  or  to  attend  the funeral  or  memorial  service  of  an  immediate  relative  who  died  as  the  result  of  wounds, disease, or injury incurred while serving in the armed forces in a combat zone. 10.13.  Health and Wellness. 10.13.1.  As  part  of  a  comprehensive  employee  health  and  wellness  program,  Installation Commanders  or  heads  of  serviced  organizations  may  excuse  civilian  employees  for  health, wellness or physical fitness activities up to 3 hours per week based on mission and workload requirements. Participation is strictly voluntary. 10.13.2.  Health  and  wellness  activities  may  be  events  sponsored  by  installation  health  and wellness  centers  (HAWCs),  medical  treatment  facilities  or  other  recognized  organizations.  These  events  include  but  are  not  limited  to:  health  fairs;  alcohol  and  tobacco  cessation programs; diet  and nutrition  classes;  relaxation and stress  management  classes or seminars; lactation  classes  and  seminars;  and  work-life  programs.  Employees  must  notify  supervisors in  advance  of  the  events  to  ensure  attendance  does  not  conflict  with  work  center requirements.  For events exceeding three hours in a single week, the employee will submit a leave request for all time in excess of three hours spent at the event(s). (T-0) 10.13.3.  Time  off  for  physical  fitness  activities  will  be  coordinated  in  advance  with management officials with  a signed agreement.   At a minimum,  the agreement will include self-certification  by  the  employee  of  fitness  to  engage  in  physical  activity  and  describe  the number  of  days  per  week  and  duration  of  absences.  A  sample  agreement  is  located  at Attachment 2. 10.13.3.1.  Employees  must  be  present  prior  to  or  following  fitness  time.  In  order  to minimize travel time away from work, employees will utilize installation fitness facilities or  facilities  immediately  adjacent  to  the  installation  or  work  center  with  which  the AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   47  employee or agency may have an agreement to provide fitness facilities for that agency. Fitness time is normally approved in conjunction with the lunch break. (T-3) 10.13.3.2.  Employees  engaged  in  telework  shall  not  take  time  off  to  perform  fitness activities while teleworking. (T-3) 10.13.4.  For  bargaining  unit  employees,  time-off  for  health,  wellness  and  fitness  at installations  or  agencies  that  are  governed  under  a  negotiated  bargaining  agreement  will adhere to the language of that agreement to the exclusion of this Air Force Instruction. (T-0) 10.14.  Rest  and  Recuperation  upon  Return  from  Civilian  Deployment.  An  Air  Force civilian employee who is deployed to an overseas location may be excused for brief periods upon return  from  deployment.  This  is  in  addition  to  administrative  leaves  in  connection  with permanent changes of station (PCS) and includes brief periods of 4 hours per day, for no more than 5 days upon return. 10.15.  Rest and Recuperation for Return from Active Duty.  An Air Force civilian employee (reservist), who is called to active duty in support of the Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) for  at  least  42  consecutive  days,  is  entitled  to  5  days  of  administrative  leave  upon  return  from active duty.  For subsequent periods of active duty in support of the OCO, supervisors may not grant more than 5 days of administrative leave within a 12-month period. The intent is to aid in the readjustment to civilian life. (See Presidential Memo, Return of Activated Military Members to Federal Civilian Employment, November 14, 2003) 10.16.  Absences Resulting From Hostile Action Abroad.  A civilian employee who is injured as the result of war, insurgency, mob violence, or similar action while serving in the CONUS or serving abroad is not charged leave for absence up to 1 year resulting from the injury.  The injury must  not  have  been  the  result  of  vicious  habit,  intemperance,  or  willful  misconduct  of  the employee. (T-0) 10.17.  Absences  Resulting  from  Emergencies  Assigned  Overseas.  Federal  employees  may receive emergency travel orders to travel to the United States for emergencies. The employee is placed in a leave status and may request annual, sick, or LWOP. 10.18.  Absences in Connection with Travel. 10.18.1.  Permanent  change  of  duty  station  (PCS).    An  employee  with  PCS  orders  may  be granted  administrative  leave  to  make  personal  arrangements  and  transact  personal  business directly  related  to  the  permanent  change  in  duty  station,  provided  that  such  business  or arrangements cannot be transacted outside regular working hours. This includes such things as closing and opening personal bank accounts, or obtaining a driver’s license and auto tags. This  provision  does  not  cover  time  involved  in  complying  with  PCS  requirements  such  as obtaining passport and vaccinations, adhering to government housing authority requirements, or  being  present  for  packing  and  receiving  of  household  goods.  Such  tasks  required  by  the PCS  are  considered  to  be  official  duties.    For  an  assignment  to  or  return  from,  overseas employment, official duties further include time spent to deliver or reclaim privately owned vehicle (POV) to or from the port facility, obtain required physical examination, vaccination and inoculation, or passport, or to comply with other special requirements imposed because of the overseas assignment, including absence to obtain travel orders.  An employee required to report to another activity to comply with overseas processing requirements is not charged leave for any absence necessary to make the trip.  Administrative leave or official duty time   48  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 only  applies  to  the  employee  for  whom  PCS  orders  has  been  authorized  and  not  to  any civilian employees who may be listed on the orders as dependents. 10.18.2.  When  extensive  permanent  change  of  duty  travel  outside  of  regularly  scheduled hours of duty is required, employees are authorized to be absent from work without charge to leave  or  loss  of  pay  for  a  reasonable  time  to  recuperate  from  fatigue  or  loss  of  sleep.    In determining  “reasonable  time”  the  supervisor  considers  the  adverse  effect  on  work performance, health, or well-being, and any safety hazard which might result from working while fatigued.  Normally, this should not exceed 4 hours.  When the total elapsed travel time exceeds 20 consecutive hours, as in the case of travel between the continental United States and  either  Pacific  or  European  bases,  up  to  8  hours  of  duty  time  may  be  excused  for recuperation. 10.18.3.  Privately Owned Conveyance. When a privately owned conveyance is authorized or approved  for  permanent  duty  travel,  except  for  renewal  agreement  travel,  travel  time  for salary payment purposes is computed on the basis of 350 miles a calendar day.  Any time in excess  of  the  computed  number  of  days  which  falls  within  the  employee’s  regularly scheduled basic workweek is charged to leave.  No charge is made to leave if an employee arrives at the new duty station before the reporting date, computed on the basis of 350 miles of travel a calendar day. 10.18.4.  Temporary  Duty  (TDY)  Travel.  Duty  time  or  administrative  leave  for  TDY  and related  travel  is  authorized  when  the  temporary  duty  is  for  official  duties  only.  Any  other TDY  not  part  of  the  employee’s  official  duties  must  be  charged  to  leave.  When  privately owned  conveyance  is  authorized  or  approved  as  being  advantageous  to  the  government  for temporary  duty  travel,  the  employee  is  considered  in  travel  status,  without  charge  to  leave, during the actual time required for official travel. In computing the actual time required, any excess time required because of a delay enroute or circuitous routing specifically determined to  be  for  the  employee’s  convenience  is  deducted  from  the  total  elapsed  time  and  the employee is required to take leave. (T-0) 10.18.4.1.  When  an  employee  is  allowed  to  use  the  employee’s  privately  owned conveyance for the employee’s own convenience on temporary duty travel, the employee is  considered  in  travel  status  for  the  scheduled  travel  time  by  common  carrier  or  usual mode  of  transportation  that  otherwise  would  be  required.    Any  time  in  excess  of  this period which falls within the employee’s scheduled basic workweek is charged to leave. 10.18.4.2.  When  an  employee  begins  or  ends  temporary  duty  travel  by  commercial carrier  during  regularly  scheduled  hours  of  duty,  supervisors  may  excuse  the  employee for up to 3 hours without charge to leave. 10.18.4.3.  When extensive temporary duty travel outside of regularly scheduled hours of duty  is  required,  employees  are  authorized  to  be  absent  from  work  without  charge  to leave or loss of pay for a reasonable time to recuperate from fatigue or loss of sleep.  This provision  does  not  apply  to  employees  who  are  performing  work  while  traveling  and being compensated by compensatory time off, paid overtime, or credit hours, e.g., ART aircrew members.  In determining “reasonable time” the supervisor considers the adverse effect  on  work  performance,  health,  or  well-being,  and  any  safety  hazard  which  might result from working while fatigued.  Normally, this should not exceed 4 hours.  When the total  elapsed travel time  exceeds 20  consecutive  hours, as in the  case of travel  between AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   49  the continental United States and either Pacific or European bases, up to 8 hours of duty time may be excused for recuperation 10.19.  Absences  related  to  Air  Force  Science,  Technology,  Engineering  and  Mathematics (STEM)  Activities.  The Air Force encourages STEM workforce members to promote creative ways to  engage  young people in  the STEM career fields  through education outreach, including science festivals, job shadowing, and mentoring. Federal scientists and engineers are encouraged to identify and pursue STEM-related volunteer activities in their communities, with an emphasis on inclusive activities that draw from all segments of society, including women. 10.19.1.  Through  direct  involvement  in  local  communities,  our  employees  can  help  foster positive  images  and  role  models  for  future  recruitment  to  Air  Force  service.    Sponsored activities will also enhance professional development or skills of the employee in his or her current  Air  Force  position.    The  following  flexibilities  are  provided  to  encourage participation. 10.19.2.    Supervisors  may  grant  brief  periods  of  Administrative  Leave  for  STEM-related volunteer  activities  without  loss  of  pay  or  charge  to  leave.  Administrative  leaves  shall  be limited to those situations (T-2) in which: 10.19.2.1.  The absence is directly related to the Air Force STEM mission and objectives; 10.19.2.2.  The absence is officially sponsored or sanctioned by the Air Force; 10.19.2.3.  The absence will clearly enhance the professional development or skills of the employee in his or her current Air Force position; and 10.19.2.4.  The absence is brief and is determined to be in the interest of the Air Force. 10.19.3.  While  participating  in  volunteer  activities  under  this  guidance  memorandum, employees  are  expected  to  maintain  high  standards  of  honesty,  responsibility,  and accountability  as  well  as  adhere  to  the  Air  Force  Core  Values  of  “Integrity  First,  Service before Self, and Excellence in All We Do.” 10.19.4.  The Joint Ethics Regulations and AFI 36-703, Civilian Conduct and Responsibility, governing outside employment  also  apply to  employees who engage in  volunteer activities. Employees  may  not  use  Air  Force  facilities  and  equipment  for  other  than  authorized purposes. Consult local legal advisors for information about what may be authorized. 10.19.5.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  each  activity  head  to  balance  support  for  employees’ volunteer activities with  the need to ensure that employees’ work requirements are fulfilled and operations are conducted efficiently and effectively. 10.20.  Absences  for  Other  Volunteer  Activities.  Employees  seeking  to  participate  in  other volunteer  activities  during  normal  working  hours  may  be  granted  annual  leave,  LWOP,  or compensatory  time  off.  Flexible  or  compressed  work  schedules  may  be  established  for employees  who  wish  to  engage  in  regular  and  recurring  volunteer  activities  during  normal working hours.   50  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 Chapter 11 VOLUNTARY LEAVE TRANSFER PROGRAM (VLTP) 11.1.  Purpose  and  Applicability.  The  purpose  of  this  chapter  is  to  set  forth  procedures  and requirements  for  the  VLTP.    This  program  allows  an  employee  who  has  a  personal  or  family medical  emergency  and  is  without  the  availability  of  paid  leave,  to  receive  transferred  annual leave  directly  from  other  employees  with  the  concurrence  of  the  respective  management officials.  This chapter applies to all employees covered by 5 U.S.C. 6301(2) and 5 CFR 630.906. 11.2.  Administrative  Procedures.  The  appointing  official  or  designee  should  establish appropriate supplemental procedures to  approve  or disapprove the  receipt of transferred  annual leave for the VLTP Program at the installation level. 11.3.  Application To Be A Leave Recipient.  An employee who has been affected by a medical emergency  may  make  written  application  to  his/her  first  level  supervisor  or  leave  approving official to become a leave recipient.  If such an employee is not capable of making application, due  to  physical  or  mental  impairment,  the  leave  applicant  or  immediate  family  member  may designate a personal representative in writing to make the application. 11.3.1.  Application Requirements.  (T-1) Each application must include the following: 11.3.1.1.  The name, position title, pay plan, grade/step, hourly/annual rate of pay of the applicant, specific organization, and office symbol of employment. 11.3.1.2.  Social security number. 11.3.1.3.  Annual and sick leave balance as of the date of application.  (Applicant should attach a copy of the latest leave and earnings statement to reflect current leave balances.) 11.3.1.4.  Expected date on which available paid leave will run out. 11.3.1.5.  Accrual rate for annual leave. 11.3.1.6.  Expected duration of the hardship. 11.3.1.7.  Description of the hardship (include health care provider documentation and/or any  attachments  that  may  be  used  as  evidence  that  will  assist  the  approving  official  in making a decision). Medical evidence must be provided by the employee/applicant and is necessary for the employee to  become a leave  recipient.  The  employee  must consent  in writing to the release of this information to officials involved in the review process. 11.3.1.8.  The  applicants  should  agree  to  the  use  of  their  names  and  approve  the  public release of the existence of a hardship for any publicized efforts to collect donated leave. If  the  employee  chooses  anonymity,  he/she  should  be  advised  that  anonymity  would likely  result  in  minimal  leave  donations.  OPM  630,  Application  to  Become  a  Leave Recipient under the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program, has a block for the employee to check  for  anonymity.  Anonymity  should  not  preclude  the  Air  Force  from  receiving donations  for  the  leave  recipient  as  in  the  case  of  donations  from  relatives  and  close friends. 11.3.1.9.  Telephone number during the period of hardship. AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   51  11.3.1.10.  Name, address, and telephone number of the person to contact on behalf of the applicant, if applicable. 11.3.2.  The  completed  application  will  be  forwarded  to  the  first  level  supervisor  for verification of the employment data and endorsed to the approving official. 11.4.  Approval  of  the  Application  to  Become  a  Leave  Recipient.  Upon  receipt  of  an application to receive transferred annual leave, the first level supervisor will verify and validate the employment information contained in the application. The application must be returned to the applicant if correction or additional information is required. The supervisor must determine that the  employee’s  absence  from  duty  without  available  paid  leave  because  of  the  medical emergency is or is expected to be at least 24 hours and is likely to result in a substantial loss of income to the employee because of the unavailability of paid leave. (T-0) Note: In the case of a part-time employee or an employee with an uncommon tour of duty, at least 30% of the average number  of  hours  in  the  employee’s  bi-weekly  scheduled  tour  of  duty  will  be  the  determining factor.  Once  the  application  receives  supervisory  endorsement,  it  is  forwarded  to  the  VLTP  approving official within 5 workdays from the date of receipt of the application. The supervisor will  provide  informal  notice  to  AFPC  that  the  employee  has  filed  an  application  to  receive transferred annual leave. The supervisory endorsement will include the following: 11.4.1.  A  statement  acknowledging  and  verifying  as  correct,  the  employment  information contained in the application. 11.4.2.  An  acknowledgment  that  if  approved,  the  supervisor  will  validate  the  continuing nature  of  the  hardship  each  pay  period  and  upon  termination  of  the  hardship,  stop  the allocation of transferred leave. 11.4.3.  An  acknowledgment  that  if  approved,  the  supervisor  is  responsible  to  properly annotate  time  and  attendance  records  to  insure  that  all  available  paid  leave  is  exhausted before  any  transferred  annual  leave  is  used  by  the  applicant.    The  supervisor  must  work closely with the civilian payroll office to monitor the use of transferred leave. (T-1) 11.4.4.  A recommendation to the approving official indicating approval or disapproval of the employee’s absence from the workplace. 11.4.5.  A  recommendation  for  the  approval  or  disapproval  of  the  application  based  on  the hardship as described by the applicant. 11.5.  Leave  Approving  Official’s  Responsibilities.  The  approving  official  or  designee  will complete the following applicable actions within 10 calendar days after receipt of the application from the supervisor. 11.5.1.  If  the  application  is  disapproved,  provide  direct  written  notice  to  the  applicant  that the application has been disapproved and the reasons for disapproval. A copy of the approved application is returned to the CPS who will provide copies to the applicant. 11.5.2.  A copy of the approved application will be provided to the applicant with copies to the  first  level  supervisor,  the  civilian  payroll  office,  and  the  servicing  CPS.    For  approved leave  recipients  who  have  agreed  to  the  release  of  their  names,  instruct  the  first  level supervisor  to  arrange  appropriate  publicity  to  employees  of  the  recipient’s  organization  of assignment  to  canvass  the  desire  to  transfer  annual  leave  to  the  recipient.    Publicity  efforts must be consistent for all employees who have approval to receive transferred annual leave.   52  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 (T-1)  If  insufficient  donations  are  received  to  cover  the  period  without  pay,  the  supervisor with  assistance  from  the  CPS  may  expand  the  publicity  effort  to  other  offices  within  the leave recipient’s organization of assignment. 11.5.3.  If the donations remain insufficient, the supervisor in cooperation with the CPS may expand publicity in the following order: 11.5.3.1.  Other organizations on the installation. 11.5.3.2.  Parent MAJCOM of applicant. 11.5.3.3.  Other AF installations. 11.5.3.4.  Other federal agencies. 11.6.  Transfer  of  Annual  Leave.  A  leave  recipient’s  employing  organization  may  accept  the transfer of annual leave from leave donors employed by the same organization and, if necessary, the transfer of approved donations by employees of other organizations. Every effort should be made  to  exhaust  all  available  donated  leave  within  the  leave  recipient’s  organization  of assignment  before  using  approved  transferred  annual  leave  from  other  organizations.  The OPM 630, 630-A, 630-B, and 630-C are available on the OPM website for transfer and receipt of annual leave in the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program. 11.6.1.  A first level supervisor is prohibited from receiving donated leave from a subordinate employee. 11.6.2.  An  employee  may  submit  to  the  servicing  CPS  an  irrevocable  request  on  the  OPM 630-A  or  the  OPM  630-B  to  transfer  a  specific  number  of  whole  hours  of  accrued  annual leave to the leave account of a specified approved leave recipient as follows: 11.6.2.1.  Name,  position  title,  pay  plan,  grade/step,  hourly/annual  rate  of  pay  and specific organization and office symbol of employment. 11.6.2.2.  Social security number. 11.6.2.3.  Annual leave balance as of the date of the request to donate leave. 11.6.2.4.  Accrual rate for annual leave. 11.6.2.5.  Number of hours to be earned during the remainder of the leave year. 11.6.2.6.  Number of hours designated as “use or lose”. 11.6.2.7.  An acknowledgment that the request to donate leave is fully voluntary without personal reservations, coercion, or intimidation. 11.6.2.8.  An acknowledgment that the donation of annual leave is irrevocable. 11.6.2.9.  An acknowledgment that the donor expects nothing in return, to include receipt of transferred annual leave. 11.6.2.10.  An acknowledgment that unused transferred annual leave will be returned on a pro-rata basis determined by the approving authority. 11.6.2.11.  The name and employing activity of the approved leave recipient, designated to receive the donation. AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   53  11.6.3.  Approval of the Donation. The leave-approving official of the donor may forward the documented, approved donation to the servicing CPS of the leave recipient. The documented donation  will  be  quality  reviewed,  validated  by  the  CPS,  and  forwarded  to  the  servicing civilian payroll office. 11.6.4.  Substitution  of  Transferred  Annual  Leave.    Annual  leave  transferred  under  this authority  may  be  substituted  retroactively  for  absence  without  pay  or  used  to  liquidate indebtedness  for  advanced  annual  or  sick  leave  as  a  result  of  an  approved  medical emergency.    (Note:    The  current  pay  system  will  not  replace  LWOP  coding.    If  an employee’s  time  and  attendance  sheet  is  marked  as  LWOP,  transferred  leave  cannot “automatically” replace that period of unpaid absence until it is deleted.  For this reason, the civilian payroll office recommends that even when an employee has no sick leave or annual leave balance, the time sheet should be marked either as sick leave (for personal illness) or as annual leave (for family member’s illness) to prevent the need to have corrected time sheets.) 11.7.  Limitations  on  Donations  of  Annual  Leave.  A  potential  leave  donor  must  have  a sufficient  number  of  hours  of  accrued  annual  leave  in  order  to  donate  leave.    Donating  leave earned in future pay periods is prohibited. (T-0) 11.7.1.  The maximum donation of leave is no more than a total of one-half of the amount of annual  leave  an  employee  would  be  entitled  to  accrue  during  the  leave  year  in  which  the donation is made (Example:  An employee who earns 104 hours of annual leave may donate a  maximum  of  52  hours.)    The  limitation  on  donating  annual  leave  may  be  waived,  in writing,  by  the  installation  commander  or  their  designee,  provided  the  employee  has extenuating circumstances and it has been documented as such. 11.7.2.  A leave donor who is projected to have annual leave that otherwise would be subject to forfeiture at the end of the leave year under 5 U.S.C 6304(a) may donate no more than the number of hours remaining in the leave year (as of the date of transfer) for which the leave donor  is  scheduled  to  work  and  receive  pay.  (Example:  If  two  weeks  before  the  end  of  the leave year, a leave donor has 100 hours of use or lose leave and is scheduled to work for only 60 hours, up to 60 hours may be donated.) The limitation on donating annual leave subject to forfeiture  may  be  waived,  in  writing,  by  the  installation  commander  or  their  designee, provided the employee has extenuating circumstances and it has been documented as such. 11.8.  Use  of  Transferred  Annual  Leave.  An  employee  in  a  shared  leave  status  using transferred leave under the Voluntary  Leave Transfer Program  may use the donated leave only for  the  purpose  of  the  medical  emergency  for  which  the  recipient  was  approved.  A  separate account  is  established  for  accruals  earned  on  donated  leave.  Employees  are  allowed  to accumulate up to 40 hours of annual and sick leave while using transferred annual leave. 11.8.1.  The approval and use of transferred annual leave by an approved leave recipient shall be  subject  to  all  the  conditions  and  requirements  imposed  by  5  U.S.C.  Chapter  63.    Upon approval,  transferred  annual  leave  received  by  an  approved  leave  recipient  may  be accumulated without regard to the limitation imposed by (normally, 30 days or 240 hours) 5 U.S.C.  6304(a).    The  leave  recipient’s  servicing  civilian  payroll  office  must  monitor  the transfer  of  donated  leave.    The  balance  of  the  transferred  leave  will  be  posted  to  the  leave recipient’s account the following leave year, if necessary. (T-0) 11.8.2.  Transferred annual leave may not be used as follows:   54  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 11.8.2.1.  Transferred to another leave recipient under this regulatory authority. 11.8.2.2.  Transferred to another employing activity upon the leave recipient’s transfer of employment. 11.8.2.3.  Included in a lump-sum payment under 5 U.S.C. 5551 or 5552. 11.8.2.4.  Made  available  for  re-credit  under  5  U.S.C.  6306  upon  reemployment  by  a federal agency. 11.9.  Termination of Medical Emergency. 11.9.1.  Based  on  medical  documentation  or  other  appropriate  action,  the  entitlement  to receive transferred leave shall terminate as follows (T-0): 11.9.1.1.  When  the  leave  recipient’s  employment  is  terminated  by  the  same  agency which approved the application to become a leave recipient. 11.9.1.2.  At the end of the bi-weekly pay period in which the leave recipient’s approving official or designee determines that the leave recipient is no longer affected by a medical emergency. 11.9.1.3.  At  the  end  of  the  bi-weekly  pay  period  in  which  the  leave  recipient’s employing  activity  receives  notice  from  the  OPM  of  an  approved  application  for disability retirement. 11.9.2.  The  leave  recipient’s  first  level  supervisor  or  leave  approving  official  shall continually monitor (each pay period) the nature and extent of medical emergency affecting the  leave  recipient.    Senior  management  officials  must  develop  and  maintain  internal procedures to insure supervisory biweekly review of the medical emergency. (T-1) 11.9.3.  When  it  is  determined  that  the  medical  emergency  or  hardship  affecting  the  leave recipient  has  terminated  (based  on  medical  evidence),  and  the  leave  recipient  has  had  the opportunity to respond, the following actions are required: 11.9.3.1.  No further donations will be accepted. 11.9.3.2.  No further transfers of annual leave will occur. 11.9.3.3.  The  supervisor  or  leave  approving  official  will  provide  written  notice  to  the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program approving official and the civilian payroll office with a copy to the leave recipient as follows: 11.9.3.3.1.  Include the name, employee’s social security number, and organization of assignment of the leave recipient. 11.9.3.3.2.  Approval date of the leave recipient’s application. 11.9.3.3.3.  Initial  date  of  receipt  of  transferred  annual  leave  and  the  date  the emergency ended as determined by the appropriate official. 11.9.3.3.4.  Total  number  of  transferred  annual  leave  hours  used,  total  number  of transferred hours donated, and unused transferred leave remaining. 11.9.3.3.5.  Date the leave recipient returned to work or separated from employment. AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   55  11.9.3.3.6.  A  statement  that  unused  transferred  leave  will  not  be  used  to  compute lump sum leave payment upon separation. 11.10.  Restoration of Transferred Annual Leave. 11.10.1.  Restoration  of unused transferred annual  leave is  computed by the civilian payroll office.    Upon  receipt  of  the  supervisory  notice  indicating  the  termination  of  the  leave recipient’s  emergency  or  hardship,  the  servicing  civilian  payroll  office  will  compute appropriate restoration of transferred annual leave as follows: 11.10.1.1.  Divide the number of hours of unused transferred leave by the total number of hours of annual leave transferred to the leave recipient. (T-0) 11.10.1.2.  Multiply the ratio obtained in  paragraph 9.10.1.1, by the number of hours of annual  leave  transferred  by  each  leave  donor  eligible  to  receive  restoration  of  unused transferred annual leave.  The leave shall be restored to the annual leave accounts of the leave  donors  who,  on  the  date  leave  restoration  is  made,  are  employed  by  a  federal agency  and  subject  to  5  CFR  630.911(a).    The  civilian  payroll  office  will  receive assistance  from  the  CPS  which  will  validate  the  donor’s  eligibility  to  receive  unused transferred annual leave. (T-0) 11.10.1.3.  Round  down  the  result  obtained  in  paragraph  9.10.1.2;  to  the  nearest increment of whole hours of annual leave. (T-0) 11.10.2.  If  the  total  number  of  eligible  leave  donors  exceeds  the  total  number  of  hours  of annual leave to be restored, no unused transferred annual leave shall be restored.  In no case shall the amount of annual leave restored to the leave donor exceed the amount transferred to the leave recipient by the leave donor. (T-0) 11.10.3.  Transferred  annual  leave  restored  to  the  account  of  a  leave  donor  before  the beginning of the third bi-weekly pay period before the end of the leave year is subject to the limitation imposed by 5 U.S.C 6304(a). (T-0) 11.10.4.  Transferred  annual  leave  restored  to  the  account  of  a  leave  donor  after  the beginning  of  the  third  bi-weekly  pay  period  before  the  end  of  the  leave  year  shall  not  be subject  to  the  limitations  imposed  by  5  U.S.C.  6304(a)  until  the  end  of  the  leave  year following the leave year in which the transferred annual leave was restored. (T-0) 11.11.  Prohibition  of  Coercion.  An  individual  may  not  directly  or  indirectly  intimidate, threaten, or coerce any other individual for the purpose of interfering with any right an employee may have to donate, not to donate, receive, or use annual leave under this chapter. 11.11.1.  Adequate publicity will be provided by management officials when an application to receive transferred annual leave is approved.  Therefore, the leave recipient is discouraged from  expressing  any  personal  solicitations  to  procure  transferred  annual  leave  from  other employees. 11.11.2.  For the purposes of this chapter the term “intimidate, threaten, or coerce” includes a prohibition  of  promise  to  confer  any  benefit  associated  with  employment  (such  as appointment,  promotion,  compensation,  hours  of  work,  or  assignment  of  duties).    Effecting or  threatening  reprisal  for  not  donating  leave  or  donating  leave  to  a  specific  employee  is strictly forbidden.   56  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 11.12.  Emergency  Leave  Transfer  Program.  Authorized  by  5  U.S.C.  6391  (as  added  by section  9004  of  P.L.  105-18,  Leave  Transfer  in  Disasters  and  Emergencies,  dated  June  12, 1997), Air Force employees are allowed to make leave donations of annual leave to employees in their own agencies or other agencies who are affected by major disasters and other emergencies. Employees  affected  by  major  disasters  may  also  be  able  to  use  leave  donated  under  the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program. This also allows employees receiving such donated leave to use it before exhausting their own accumulated annual and sick leave. OPM 1637, Application to Become  a  Leave  Recipient  Under  the  Emergency  Leave  Transfer  Program,  and  OPM  1638, Request  to  Donate  Annual  Leave  under  the  Emergency  Leave  Transfer  Program,  may  be  used for  receiving  donated  annual  leave  or  donating  annual  leave  under  this  program.  OPM  1639, Transfer of Donated Annual Leave To or From the Emergency Leave Transfer Program, must be used for the purpose of donating or receiving annual leave from other agencies. (T-0) AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   57  Chapter 12 FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT (FMLA) 12.1.  Purpose.  This chapter implements the FMLA and 5 CFR Part 630, Subpart L, Family and Medical  Leave.    It  entitles  Federal  employees  to  a  total  of  12  administrative  workweeks  of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for certain family and medical needs as specified in 5 CFR 630.1203(a). 12.2.  Coverage.  This chapter applies to employees covered by 5 U.S.C. 6381(1). 12.3.  Leave  Entitlement.  A  covered  employee  is  entitled  to  a  total  of  12  administrative workweeks of unpaid leave (i.e., LWOP) during any 12-month period for: 12.3.1.  The birth of a son or daughter and care of the newborn. 12.3.2.  The placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care. 12.3.3.  The care of a spouse, son, daughter, or parent of the employee with a serious health condition. 12.4.  Serious Health Condition.  As defined in 5 CFR 630.1202, the serious health condition of the employee that makes the employee unable to  perform  duties of his  or her position.  NOTE: An employee may elect to substitute paid leave IAW paragraph 12.9. An employee must provide written medical documentation of a serious health condition, signed by the health care provider no  later  than  15  calendar  days  after  the  date  requested  by  the  Air  Force.  Form  WH-380, Documentation  of  Health  Care  Provider,  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  Labor,  may  be  used  by employees  to  satisfy  this  mandatory  requirement  to  furnish  a  medical  documentation  from  a health  care  provider,  including  second  or  third  opinions  and  documentation  .This  form  is available for use on the OPM website. (T-0) 12.4.1.  A serious health condition has the same meaning as used in the Office of Personnel Management’s regulations for administering the FMLA and may be found at Attachment 1 of this Instruction. This  definition includes, but is not limited to, such conditions as cancer, heart  attacks,  heart  conditions  requiring  heart  bypass  or  valve  operations,  back  conditions requiring extensive therapy or surgical procedures, kidney dialysis, physical therapy, strokes, severe  injuries,  severe  respiratory  conditions,  spinal  injuries,  appendicitis,  pneumonia, emphysema,  severe  arthritis,  severe  nervous  disorders,  injuries  caused  by  serious  accidents on or off the job, clinical depression, recovery from major surgery, final stages of a terminal illness,  Alzheimer’s  disease,  pregnancy,  and  childbirth.  This  may  include  “emotional” support for a family member receiving nursing care or medical care in a medical facility. A serious  health  condition  is  not  intended  to  cover  short-term  conditions  for  which  treatment and  recovery  are  very  brief.  The  common  cold,  flu,  earaches,  upset  stomach,  headaches (other  than  migraines),  routine  dental  or  orthodontia  problems,  etc.,  are  not  serious  health conditions unless complications arise. Medical documentation is required for a serious health condition. 12.4.2.  Medical Documentation. An employee must provide written medical documentation to  document  the  use  of  FMLA  leave  for  a  serious  health  condition.  Requests  shall  be submitted  to  the  approving  official  on  an  OPM  Form  71  or  within  an  approved  automated timekeeping system. The employee must provide written medical documentation of a serious   58  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 health condition, signed by the health care provider no later than 15 workdays after the date requested  by  the  Air  Force.  See  definition  of  Medical  Documentation  at  Attachment  1, which incorporates 5 CFR 630.1208, for guidance. An additional written statement must be provided  from  the  health  care  provider  concerning  the  family  member’s  need  for psychological  comfort  and/or  physical  care.  The  statement  must  certify  that  the  family member  requires  psychological  comfort  and/or  physical  care,  the  family  member  would benefit from the employee’s care or presence, and the specific length of time the employee is needed to care for the family member. (T-0) 12.4.3.  An employee faced with a family medical emergency who has exhausted his or her entitlement  to  12  weeks  of  leave  (or  a  lesser  amount  if  the  employee  has  not  accrued  12 weeks  of  leave)  may  receive  donated  annual  leave.    In  addition,  an  employee  who  is  using donated annual leave on the effective date of new sick leave accrual is required to use all of his or her available sick leave for family care purposes before he or she can continue to use donated annual leave. 12.4.4.  Childbirth  and  Newborns.    Pregnant  employees  are  entitled  to  use  sick  leave  or FMLA  leave  for  prenatal  and  postnatal  medical  appointments  and  any  periods  of incapacitation as a result of pregnancy and childbirth.  A biological mother or father cannot use  12  weeks  of  sick  leave  to  care  for  a  healthy  newborn,  but  only  for  one  with  a  serious health  condition.    A  parent  may  use  annual  leave  or  FMLA  leave  to  care  for  a  healthy newborn. 12.5.  Requirements for Invoking FMLA.  An employee must invoke his or her entitlement to family or medical leave subject to proper notification and medical documentation requirements in 5 CFR 630.1206 and 5 CFR 630.1207. Request for FMLA must be supported by evidence that is  administratively  acceptable  to  the  Air  Force,  consistent  with  the  regulations.  If  an  employee does  not  comply  with  the  request  for  sufficient  medical  documentation,  the  employee  is  not entitled  to  leave  under  FMLA.  However,  if  the  employee  is  unable  to  provide  the  requested medical  documentation  before  leave  begins,  or  if  there  is  a  question  about  the  validity  of  the original documentation provided by the employee and the medical treatment requires the leave to begin,  provisional  leave  will  be  granted  pending  final  written  medical  documentation.  Barring emergency  situations  not  known  in  advance,  an  employee  must  provide  the  employing  agency 30-days advance notice of intent of the need for FMLA and may not retroactively invoke his or her  entitlement  to  FMLA.  However,  if  an  employee  and  his/her  personal  representative  are physically or mentally incapable of invoking the employee’s entitlement to FMLA leave during the  entire  period  in  which  the  employee  is  absent  from  work,  the  employee  may  retroactively invoke  his/her  entitlement  to  FMLA  leave  within  two  workdays  after  returning  to  work.  An employee may take up to 12 administrative work weeks of family and medical leave necessary for the circumstances that prompted the need for FMLA. This leave may be taken intermittently. If  an  employee  who  is  in  a  LWOP  status  (even  to  accompany  a  military  spouse  or  civilian sponsor)  invokes  FMLA,  the  employee  still  has  the  entitlement  to  FMLA.  Since  the  agency allowed the employee to go on LWOP instead of separating the employee, the employee is still on the roles of the agency and has the entitlement to FMLA. (T-0) 12.6.  Effective  Date  of  FMLA.  The  12-month  period  begins  on  the  date  an  employee  first takes  leave  for  a  family  or  medical  need  and  continues  for  12  months.    An  employee  is  not entitled  to  12  additional  workweeks  of  leave  until  the  previous  12-month  period  ends  and  an AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   59  event occurs that entitles the employee to another period of family or medical leave.  (This may include a continuation of a previous situation.) 12.7.  Covered  Employees.  FMLA  is  available  to  full-time  and  part-time  employees.    An employee must have completed 12 months of service (not required to be recent or consecutive if applying for FMLA under 5 CFR 630.1201(b)(ii)).  A total of 12 administrative workweeks will be made available equally for full-time or part-time employees in direct proportion to the number of hours in the employee’s regularly scheduled administrative workweek.  The 12 administrative workweeks  of  leave  will  be  calculated  on  an  hourly  basis  and  will  equal  12  times  the  average number of hours in the employee’s regularly scheduled administrative workweek.  If the number of hours in an employee’s workweek varies from week to week, a weekly average of the hours scheduled  over  the  12  weeks  prior  to  the  date  leave  begins  will  be  used  as  the  basis  for  the calculation. (T-0) 12.8.  Protection of Employment and Benefits.  Upon return from FMLA leave, the employee must be returned to the same position held when the leave began or an equivalent position with equivalent  benefits,  pay, status,  and other terms  and conditions  of employment.   An equivalent position  must  be  in  the  same  commuting  area  and  must  have  the  same  or  substantially  similar duties and responsibilities of the position held when the leave began. (T-0) 12.9.  Health  Benefits.  While  on  FMLA  leave,  the  employee  is  entitled  to  maintain  health benefits coverage under the FEHB Program.  If the employee is on LWOP under the FMLA, the employee is responsible for paying the employee share of the health benefits premium. 12.10.  Substitution  of  Paid  Leave.  An  employee  may  choose  to  substitute  annual  leave  for unpaid  leave  under  the  FMLA.    Substitution  of  paid  leave  for  FMLA  cannot  be  done retroactively.  An employee may also substitute sick leave in those situations in which the use of sick leave is permitted and made in advance.  Advanced annual or sick leave and/or leave made available to an employee under the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program may also be available. 12.11.  Expanded Family and Medical Leave  Policies.  Employees may schedule and take up to  24  hours  of  LWOP  each  leave  year  for  participation  in  school  activities,  routine  family medical appointments, and elderly relatives’ health needs. 12.12.  Qualifying Leave for an Exigency.  This provision provides eligible Federal employees up  to  12  administrative  workweeks  of  unpaid  leave  under  the  Family  Medical  Leave  Act (FMLA)  for  qualifying  exigency  purposes  during  any  12-month  period.    This  provision  helps employees  manage  family  affairs  when  their  family  members  are  on  covered  active  duty  to  a foreign country.  State-side active duty does not qualify for exigency leave. 12.12.1.  Qualifying  exigencies  arise  when  the  spouse,  son,  daughter,  or  parent  of  an employee  is  on  covered  active  duty  in  the  Armed  Forces,  or  has  been  notified  of  an impending call or order to covered active duty status to a foreign country. 12.12.2.  Covered military member means the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status. Son or daughter on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status means the employee’s biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child for whom the employee stood in loco parentis, who is on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status, and who is of any age.   60  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 12.12.3.  In the case of a member of a regular component of the Armed Forces, duty during the  deployment  of  the  member  with  the  Armed  Forces  to  a  foreign  country  under  a  call  or order to active duty (or notification of an impending call or order to active duty). 12.12.4.  In the case of a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces, duty during the  deployment  of  the  member  with  the  Armed  Forces  to  a  foreign  country  under  a  call  or order to active duty (or notification of an impending call or order to active duty) in support of a contingency operation pursuant to any of the following sections of title 10, U.S.C., or any other provision of law during a war or during a national emergency declared by the President or  Congress:  Section  688,  Section  1230(a),  Section  12302,  Section  12304,  Section  12305, Section 12406, and Chapter 15. 12.12.5.  Requirement  to  invoke  FMLA  for  qualifying  exigency  leave.    An  employee  must invoke his or her entitlement to family and medical leave.  An employee’s notice of his or her intent  to  take  leave  under  the  qualifying  exigency  provision  may  suffice  as  the  employee’s confirmation. (T-0) 12.13.  Categories of Qualifying Exigencies. 12.13.1.  Short-notice  Deployments.    To  address  any  issue  that  arises  from  the  fact  that  a covered military member is notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty 7 or fewer  calendar  days  prior  to  the  date  of  deployment.    Leave  taken  for  this  purpose  can  be used for a period of up to 7 calendar days beginning on the date a covered military member is notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty. 12.13.2.  Military  Events  and  Related  Activities.  1)  To  attend  any  official  ceremony, program, or event sponsored by the military that is related to the covered active duty or call to covered active duty status of a covered military member; and 2) to attend family support or assistance  programs  and  informational  briefings  sponsored  or  promoted  by  the  military, military  service  organizations,  or  the  American  Red  Cross  that  are  related  to  the  covered active duty or call to covered active duty status of a covered military member. 12.13.3.  Childcare  and  School  Activities.  1)  To arrange for alternative childcare when the covered  active  duty  or  call  to  covered  active  duty  status  of  a  covered  military  member necessitates  a  change  in  the  existing  childcare  arrangement  for  a  child;  2)  to  provide childcare  on  an  urgent,  immediate  need  basis  (but  not  on  a  routine,  regular,  or  everyday basis)  when  the  need  to  provide  such  care  arises  from  the  covered  active  duty  or  call  to covered active duty status of a covered military member for a child; 3) to enroll in or transfer to a new school or day care facility or a child, when enrollment or transfer is necessitated by the covered active duty  or call to  covered active duty status  of a  covered military member; and 4) to attend meetings with staff at a school or a daycare facility, such as meetings with school  officials  regarding  disciplinary  measures,  parent-teacher  conferences,  or  meetings with  school  counselors, for a child when such meetings are necessary due to  circumstances arising from the covered active duty or call to covered active duty status of a covered military member. 12.13.4.  Financial  and  Legal  Arrangements.    1)  To  make  or  update  financial  or  legal arrangements to address the covered military member’s absence while on covered active duty or  call  to  covered  active  duty  status,  such  as  preparing  and  executing  financial  and  health care  powers  of  attorney,  transferring  bank  account  signature  authority,  enrolling  in  the AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   61  Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), obtaining military identification cards,  or  preparing  or  updating  a  will  or  living  trust;  and  2)  to  act  as  the  covered  military member’s  representative  before  a  Federal,  State,  or  local  agency  for  purposes  of  obtaining, arranging,  or  appealing  military  service  benefits  while  the  covered  military  member  is  on covered  active  duty  or  call  to  covered  active  duty  status,  and  for  a  period  of  90  days following the termination of the covered military member’s covered active duty status. 12.13.5.  Counseling.  To  attend  counseling  provided  by  someone  other  than  a  health  care provider for oneself, for the covered military member, or for a child, provided that the need for counseling arises from the covered active duty or call to covered active duty status of a covered  military  member.    Counseling  may  be  provided  by  a  military  chaplain,  pastor,  or minister, or counseling offered by the military or a military service organization. 12.13.6.  Rest and Recuperation.  To spend time with a covered military member who is on short-term, temporary, rest and recuperation leave during the period of deployment.  Eligible employees may take up to 5 days of leave for each instance of rest and recuperation. 12.13.7.  Post-deployment Activities.  1) To attend arrival ceremonies, reintegration briefings and  events,  and  any  other  official  ceremony  or  program  sponsored  by  the  military  for  a period of 90 days following the termination of the covered military member’s covered active duty status; and 2) to address issues that arise from the death of a covered military member while on covered active duty status, such as meeting and recovering the body of the covered military member and making funeral arrangements. 12.13.8.  Additional Activities.  To address other events that arise out of the covered military member’s  covered  active  duty  or  call  to  covered  active  duty  status,  provided  that  the supervisor and employee agree that such leave qualifies as an exigency, and that they agree to both the timing and duration of such leave. 12.13.9.  Qualifying  exigency  leave  may  be  taken  intermittently  or  on  a  reduced  leave schedule. 12.13.10.  Verification of Exigency.  Employee is required to  provide a copy of the service member’s  active  duty  orders  and  any  documentation  to  verify  the  member  is  on  covered active  duty  or  call  to  covered  active  duty  status  to  a  foreign  country.    This  documentation need  only  be  provided  the  first  time  an  employee  requests  leave  because  of  a  qualifying exigency.   62  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 Chapter 13 ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE FOR BONE MARROW OR ORGAN DONATION 13.1.  Absences  to  Serve  as  a  Bone-Marrow,  Stem  Cell  or  Organ  Donor.  An  employee  is entitled  to  use  7  days  of  paid  leave  each  calendar  year  (in  addition  to  annual  or  sick  leave)  to serve as a bone-marrow or stem cell donor. An employee may use up to 30 days of paid leave as an  organ  donor.  Bone-marrow  or  organ  donor  leave  may  be  used,  but  is  not  limited  to,  such situations as blood testing, tissue testing, counseling, physical examinations, travel time, surgery, and recuperation. Employees who are screened, but not accepted as donors, are entitled to bone-marrow, stem cell, or organ donor leave for their absences in conjunction with their attempt to be donors. Medical procedures and recuperation depend on the circumstance of each case. Record this type of leave on the time and attendance documentation under administrative or other leave category. 13.2.  Absence  of  Employee  Having  Bone-Marrow  Removed.  An  individual  having  bone-marrow removed and stored for future use is not a “donor,” and the benefit of 7 days of paid time off was not intended for someone who is undergoing such a procedure for his or her own needs.  Sick leave, annual leave, and advanced annual and sick leave are available to an employee facing this type of medical procedure.  In addition, leave donated under the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program  and  LWOP  under  the  FMLA  may  be  used  if  the  condition  meets  the  requirements  of these programs. AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015   63  Chapter 14 HOME LEAVE 14.1.  Home  Leave  Entitlement.  The purpose of home leave is  to  ensure employees who live Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) for an extended period undergo reorientation and  re-exposure  in  the  United  States  on  a  regular  basis.  Home  leave  is  authorized  after  an employee  has  completed  24  months  of  continuous  service.  Service  abroad  means  service  at  an OCONUS post of duty. 14.1.1.  Home leave is earned at a rate of 5, 10, or 15 days based on the number of months of service OCONUS and criteria in 5 CFR 630.604. 14.1.2.  Employees  may  not  use  home  leave  when  while  on  approved  travel  orders  to CONUS for emergency situations. They may be placed on annual leave, sick leave, or other paid or unpaid leave status. 14.1.3.  Employees may not use home leave following return to a permanent position in the Continuous United States (CONUS). 14.2.  Subsequent  Service  Abroad.  In  accordance  with  5  CFR  630.606(c)(2)  and  DoD 1400.25-M,  DoD  Civilian  Personnel  Manuel,  Subchapter  1260,  Home  Leave,  home  leave  may be  granted  only  when  an  employee  has  completed  24  months  of  continuous  service  abroad.  Home leave not  granted  during an employee’s period of service abroad, or within a reasonable period after returning from service abroad when it is contemplated that the employee will return to  service abroad immediately or on completion of an assignment in  the United States, may be granted  only  when  the  employee  has  completed  a  further  substantial  period  of  service  abroad.  This further substantial period of service abroad may not be less than the tour of duty prescribed for  the  employee’s  post  of  assignment,  except  when  the  responsible  Wing/Installation Commander, or designee, determines that an earlier and shorter grant of home leave is warranted on a case-by-case basis. 14.3.  Refund for  Home  Leave.  An employee is indebted for the home leave used by him/her when  he/she  fails  to  return  to  service  abroad  after  the  period  of  home  leave,  or  after  the completion of an assignment in the United States. However, a refund for this indebtedness is not required when (1) the employee has completed not less than 6 months’ service in an assignment in  the  United  States  following  the  period  of  home  leave;  (2)  the  agency  determines  that  the employee’s  failure  to  return  was  due  to  compelling  personal  reasons  of  a  humanitarian  or compassionate  nature,  such  as  may  involve  physical  or  mental  health  or  circumstances  over which the employee has no control; or (3) the agency which granted the home leave determines that it is in the public interest not to return the employee to his overseas assignment.

Absent without Leave (AWOL)—An absence from duty which was not authorized or for which leave  has  been  denied.    Neither  the  denial  of  leave  nor  the  time  and  attendance  reporting  of   66  AFI36-815  8 JULY 2015 AWOL  is  punitive,  and  neither  means  that  the  employee  has  insufficient  reason  for  requesting leave.  Note:  Rather,  it  means  that  the  employee’s  presence  is  required  and  that  the  reason  for requesting it is not one for which leave must be approved.  The employee’s failure to honor the leave denial and the unauthorized absence may form the basis for disciplinary or adverse action. Accrued  Leave—Leave earned by an employee during the current leave year that is unused at any given time in that leave year. Accumulated Leave—Unused leave remaining to the credit of an employee at the beginning of a leave year. Administrative Workweek—A period of 7 consecutive 24-hour periods designated in advance by the head of an agency under 5 U.S.C. 6101. Approving  Official—The  individual  or  designated  representative  who  acts  as  the  approving/ disapproving  official  for  civilian  absence  and  leave  programs,  e.g.,  for  receipt  of  transferred annual leave. Available  Paid  Leave—Accrued or accumulated annual,  sick or military leave and re-credited and  restored  annual  or  sick  leave.    Available  paid  leave  does  not  include  annual  or  sick  leave advanced to an employee or any annual leave transferred and accrued under the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program provisions. Contagious  Disease—A  disease  that  is  ruled  as subject  to  quarantine,  requires  isolation  of  the patient, or requires restriction of movement by the patient for a specified period, as prescribed by health authorities having jurisdiction. Examples of contagious diseases that meet this definition include  employees  who  have  been  exposed  to  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome  (SARS)  or the strain of tuberculosis that is highly resistant to antibiotics. Committed  relationship—means  one  in  which  the  employee,  and  the  domestic  partner  of  the employee,  are  each  other's  sole  domestic  partner  (and  are  not  married  to  or  domestic  partners with  anyone  else);  and  share  responsibility  for  a  significant  measure  of  each  other's  common welfare and  financial obligations. This  includes,  but  is  not  limited to,  any relationship  between two individuals of the same or opposite sex that is granted legal recognition by a State or by the District of Columbia as a marriage or analogous relationship (including, but not limited to, a civil union). Domestic  Partner—For the purpose of this  Instruction other than those sections related to the FMLA (which does not give rights to domestic partners), domestic partner is defined as an adult in  a  committed  relationship  with  another  adult,  including  both  same-sex  and  opposite-sex relationships.
