To train and equip a foreign country’s national military forces, i.e., forces under the b. To build the capacity of a foreign country’s maritime security forces (including non-MOD   1.  GCCs and COMs will lead the annual section 1206 proposal submission effort, with Military Departments and other DoD Components in support.    2.  Section 1206 funds may only be used:     authority of the Ministry of Defense (MOD), in order for that country to conduct counterterrorism operations or participate in or support military and stability operations in which U.S. Armed Forces are participating; or     elements) to conduct counterterrorism operations.    3.   Section 1206 funding may not be used to provide assistance that is otherwise prohibited by any provision of law.    4.   Congress has indicated that section 1206 assistance for military and stability operations should be used to train and equip partner nations with a demonstrated need for assistance in third theaters, such as Iraq or Afghanistan.    (See section 10 of this enclosure.)    5.   Programs shall comply with Leahy human rights vetting requirements, in accordance with Reference (d) and section 620J of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (Reference (e)).   No assistance shall be provided to units that would otherwise be restricted, either legally or by policy, from receiving security assistance.    All units scheduled to receive training or equipment provided in accordance with Reference (c) shall be vetted in accordance with DoD and DOS Leahy human rights vetting requirements not more than 12 months before provision of such assistance.   DOS shall conduct the vetting in coordination with the country team.    6.   Countries that are otherwise prohibited from receiving the proposed training and equipping assistance (pursuant to, for example, section 7101 of Reference (e), also known as “The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000;” section 7012 of Public Law 111-117, also known as “The Brooke Amendment” (Reference (k)); section 7008 of Reference (k), also known as “The Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Act, 2010;” and successor provisions restricting assistance to any country whose duly elected head of government has been deposed in a coup) may not be included in section 1206 programs.    7.   A pseudo LOA or a pseudo FMS case is used by the Department of Defense to track the sale of defense articles and services under section 1206.    The pseudo LOA itemizes the defense articles and services to be provided pursuant to a program plan approved by the Secretary of Defense with  13  ENCLOSURE 3  DRAFT—NOT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OR COMPLIANCE the concurrence of the Secretary of State and after congressional notification in accordance with section 1206.    Although pseudo-FMS cases use many of the traditional FMS procedures, these cases are subject to unique policy requirements to ensure the cases are developed and managed according to the particular program requirements applicable to the funding authority or other relevant provisions of law.    For example, some pseudo-FMS cases developed for training, design, and construction services are subject to particular, additional requirements.    8.   Section 1206 programs may include the provision of equipment, supplies, and training.    Any construction must be relatively minor and only as necessary and incidental to installation of critical components that are provided (e.g., a concrete pad for a coastal radar).    9.   The annual selection of programs for approval shall be undertaken as a closely coordinated process with the DOS; all program proposals shall be jointly formulated and coordinated between the GCC and the appropriate COM.    10. Currently, section 1206 funds may not be used for support of Iraqi or Afghan security forces.   Section 1206 funds may be used to support coalition members preparing to deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan for military and stability operations alongside U.S. forces.    Section 1206 funds should not be used for Pakistan, provided the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund are in effect to meet training and equipment requirements in Pakistan.    11. Reference (c) shall not be used to backfill or overlap with other authorities, including lower-priority projects unfunded by FMF, DoD counter-narcotics authorities, cooperative threat reduction authorities, or other partner capacity-building programs.    12. Section 1206 program planning shall take into account the fiscal and contracting limitations inherent in the use of expiring DoD annual operation and maintenance (O&M) funds.    DoD 7000.14-R (Reference (m)) provides guidance on the use of O&M funds; however, there are some exceptions applicable to section 1206 that are not covered in existing DoD guidance.    For example, the investment or expense threshold does not apply, and the cross-fiscal year authority provides an exception to the bona fide needs rule (see paragraph (c) (4) of Reference (c)).    13. Training may begin in the fiscal year in which the program is approved but must be completed by the end of the following fiscal year.    Temporary duty (TDY) expenses may be obligated in Year One for training that will be provided into Year Two, or for training and TDY expenses wholly measured in Year Two.    The section 1206 program must begin in Year One and end in Year Two.    Civilian salaries may be obligated across fiscal years; civilian personnel are not required to cease their section 1206-related activities at the end of Year One.    If military pay is part of the reimbursable expense, that, too, may be reimbursed from section 1206 funds.    14. Section 1206 programs shall be subject to these temporary limitations on amounts for building capacity to participate in or support military and stability operations; not more than $75,000,000 may be used during Fiscal Year 2011, and not more than $100,000,000 may be used during Fiscal Year 2012.     14  ENCLOSURE 3  DRAFT—NOT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OR COMPLIANCE 15. Military Departments will afford section 1206 pseudo FMSLOAs priority handling.    With DOS approval, DSCA will place the pseudo FMS-LOA in an “offered” status.    When all conditions for funding have been met, the Military Departments will then post the accepted status.   DSCA will complete the financial implementation processes in coordination with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service.  15  ENCLOSURE 3  DRAFT—NOT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OR COMPLIANCE  DoDI5111.19_AFI16-124    23 APRIL 2013    GLOSSARY  ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS    AFI AFMAN AFPD  AFSAC Directorate  ASD(SO/LIC&IC)    CCM  COM   CONPLAN    DIILS   DoDD   DoDI   DOS   DSCA DSCA DBO/CFM   DSCA PGM/BPC    DSCA STR/POL     FMF   FMS    GCC   GC, DoD   HAFMD  IMET    LOA   (Added)(AF) Air Force Instruction (Added)(AF) Air Force Manual (Added)(AF) Air Force Policy Directive  (Added)(AF) Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation Directorate  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict and Interdependent Capabilities    (Added)(AF) command country manager  chief of mission   contingency plan    Defense Institute of International Legal Studies   DoD Directive   DoD Instruction   Department of State   Defense Security Cooperation Agency   (Added)(AF) DSCA Business Operations Directorate, Country Financial Management Division (Added)(AF) DSCA Programs Directorate, Building Partnership Capacity Division (Added)(AF) DSCA Strategy Directorate, Policy Division   foreign military financing   foreign military sales    Geographic Combatant Commanders   General Counsel of the Department of Defense    (Added)(AF) Headquarters Air Force Mission Directive  international military education and training    letter of offer and acceptance   16  GLOSSARY  LOR    MOD   MORD  O&M   OUSD(P)    PN    SAF/IAPX   SCO    SecDef    TDY    U.S.C.
