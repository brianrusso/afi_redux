This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document identifying life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources,  and  minimum  core  task  requirements  for  Biomedical  Equipment  personnel.  The CFETP provides supervisors, trainers, and trainees a clear career path.  2.    Civilians  occupying  associated  positions  will  use  Part  II  to  support  duty  position qualification  training.  Civilians  occupying  these  positions  will  be  graduates  of  a  DoD Biomedical  Equipment  Technician  (BMET)  training  program;  or  be  graduates  of  a  formal civilian BMET training program; or have 2 years of field experience as a BMET. Certification as  a  Certified  Biomedical  Equipment  Technician  (CBET)  through  the  AAMI  Credentials Institute (ACI), as well as A+, Network+ and Security+ are highly recommended.  3.  The CFETP consists of two parts. Supervisors use both parts to plan, manage, and control training within the career field.  3.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A  explains  how  everyone  will  use  the  plan.    Section  B  identifies  career  field  progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path.  Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other).  Section  D  indicates  resource  constraints  (Examples:  funds,  manpower,  equipment,  and facilities).  Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt.  3.2.  Part  II  includes  the  following:    Section  A  identifies  the  Specialty  Training  Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training  Command  (AETC)  conducted  training,  core  tasks,  and  correspondence  course requirements.  Section B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to determine if airmen satisfy training requirements.  Section C identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses.  Section D identifies MAJCOM-unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification  needs.   Section  E  provides  guidelines  for  managing  and documenting  enlisted training  (medical  specific).    Section  F  provides  guidelines  and  examples  of  proper documentation of all enlisted medical personnel training.  4.  Guidance provided in this CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career. This plan will enable leaders to train todayâ€™s work force for tomorrow's jobs. At the unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  3 ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED   A+:  Application Plus  AAMI: Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation  AAS: Associate in Applied Science  ACCE: American College of Clinical Engineering  ACI: AAMI Credentials Institute  Advanced Training.

This  CFETP  provides  information  necessary  for  Air  Force  Career  Field Managers  (AFCFMs),  MAJCOM  Functional  Managers  (MFM),  commanders,  training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program.  This plan outlines the training individuals in the 4A2X1 specialty must receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFSC-specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  For our career field, the Medical Education and  Training  Campus  (METC)  with  the  support  of  the  937th  Training  Group  at  Fort  Sam Houston, TX provides this training.  1.1.  Upgrade  training  identifies  the  mandatory  courses,  task  qualification  requirements,  and correspondence  course  completion  requirements  for  award  of  the  3-,  5-,  7-,  and  9-skill  levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in  a  specific  duty  position.    This  training  program  occurs  both  during  and  after  the  upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected Airmen.  Proficiency training is  additional  training  provided  to  personnel  to  increase  their  skills  and  knowledge  beyond  the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP has several purposes, some are:  1.1.1.  Serves  as  a  management  tool  to  plan,  manage,  conduct,  and  evaluate  a  career  field training  program.    It  also,  helps  supervisors  identify  training  at  the  appropriate  point  in  an individualâ€™s career.  1.1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individualâ€™s career.  1.1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method.  1.1.4. Identifies major resource constraints which impact full implementation of the desired career field training process.  2. Uses.  MFMs and supervisors at all levels will use the plan to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.   2.1.  AETC  training  personnel  will  develop/revise  formal  resident,  non-resident,  field  and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of  the  CFETP.    AETC  training  personnel  and  MFMs  will  also  work  with  the  AFCFM  to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.   2.2.  MFMs  will  ensure  their  training  programs  complement  the  CFETP  mandatory  initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements.  OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses  can  satisfy  identified  requirements.    MAJCOM-developed  training  to  support  this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into the program.   2.3.  Each  individual  will  complete  the  mandatory  training  requirements  specified  in  this program.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.   10  3.  Coordination  and  Approval.  The  AFCFM  is  the  approval  authority.    MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The AETC training manager for this specialty will initiate an annual review of this document by AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy.  Using the list of courses in Part II, AETC and MFMs will eliminate duplicate training.  11 SECTION B, CAREER PROGRESSION AND INFORMATION  1.  Specialty Descriptions  1.1. Specialty Summary.

Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, this STS:   2.1. Lists in column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for Airman to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.  Number task statements sequentially i.e., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1.  Tasks identified in Column  2a  thru  2c  identified  with  an  (*)  are  core  tasks  for  Active,  Guard  and  Reserve personnel in the 3-, 5- and 7-skill level.   2.2.  Provides  certification  for  OJT.    Columns  3a  thru  3e  are  used  to  record  completion  of tasks  and  knowledge  training  requirements.  Use  the  automated  Air  Force  Training  Record (AFTR) to document technician qualifications.   2.3. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements.  Columns 4a thru 4c show the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task/knowledge  and  the  career  knowledge  provided  by  the  correspondence  course.    See CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit training manager for current CDC listings.   2.4. Qualitative Requirements.  The proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.   2.5.  Documentation.    Use  the  automated  system  to  document  all  technician  qualifications.  NOTE: An Air Force Job Qualification Standard may be used in lieu of Part II of the CFETP only  upon  approval  of  the  AFCFM.    The  AFCFM  may  supplement  these  minimum documentation procedures as needed or deemed necessary for their Career Field.   2.5.1. Transcribing a new or revised CFETP.  The 4A2X1 AFCFM will provide transcription instructions to the AFTR program manager and field users.  This process will be seamless to the field user as all existing trainee records will be auto-transcribed.   2.5.2.  Documenting  Career  Knowledge.    When  a  CDC  is  not  available  the  supervisor identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover the mandatory items in the AFECD.   2.5.3. Decertification and Recertification.  When an airman is found to be unqualified on a task  previously  certified  for  his  or  her  position,  the  supervisor  deletes  the  previous  AFTR documented certification.  Appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form 623A, On-The-Job Training  Record  Continuation  Sheet  identifying  the  reason  for  decertification.    Upon subsequent recertification, document AFTR as for any other training qualification.   2.6. Training Standard.  Tasks are trained and qualified to the go/no go level.  Go means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meet accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures.    27 2.7. The CFETP serves as a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman  Promotion  System  (WAPS).    Senior  Noncommissioned  Officers  (SNCO)  with extensive practical experience in their career fields develop Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) at the Airman Advancement Division.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions  are  based  upon  study  references  listed  in  the  Enlisted  Promotions  Reference  and Requirements  Catalog.    Individual  responsibilities  are  in  AFI  36-2605,  Air  Force  Military Personnel Testing System.   3.  Recommendations.

The  following  information  applies  to  the  Air  Reserve  Component  (ARC)/Air National Guard (ANG) and serves to provide ARC/ANG Biomedical Equipment Technicians (BMET)  apprentices  (non-prior-service  and  retrainees)  with  an  opportunity  to  receive  the additional training days necessary to become proficient in maintaining biomedical equipment that is identified in this STS as a core task.  This section applies to all BMETs assigned to all Air  Force  Reserve  and  Air  National  Guard  medical  and  aeromedical  evacuation  squadrons (referred to, hereafter, as medical unit).  1.1. Qualification (also referred to as proficiency or seasoning) training requirements:  1.1.1.  Qualification  training  days  is  available  for  ARC/ANG  BMET  apprentices  to satisfactorily initiate and complete the core task training requirements identified in this STS.  1.1.2.  Upon  completion  of  the  DoD  Biomedical  Equipment  Technician  training  program, L8ABJ4A231 00AA, all BMET apprentices will be assigned to a Medical Equipment Repair Center (MERC) for 120 days to acquire proficiency in performing the core tasks required to successfully achieve the 5-skill level according to Air Force upgrade training guidelines.  1.1.3.  For  optimal  results,  this  follow-on  training  should  commence  immediately  following graduation from the Biomedical Equipment Technician Apprentice training program.  1.2.  Advanced  planning  is  required  to  ensure  the  apprentice  receives  qualification  training immediately upon graduating from the DoD Biomedical Equipment Technician course.  With concurrence  from  the  ARC  medical  unit  commander,  the  section  BMET  supervisor,  in conjunction with the senior air reserve/health, technician must contact the regional MERC to arrange  follow-on  training  for  the  newly  assigned  BMET  trainee  (4A2X1).    This  process should also be coordinated with the guard liaison at JBSA Ft Sam Houston TX.  The MERC may recommend the apprentice receive upgrade training at a qualified AF MTF if extenuating circumstances  (i.e.,  lack  of  qualified  available  staff,  committed  to  supporting  contingency operations, etc.) fail to permit the apprentice from receiving the training at the MERC.  (A qualified  MTF  is  defined  as  a  facility  which  possesses  the  time,  equipment,  and  expertise necessary  to  train  the  apprentice  on  all  core  tasks  as  outlined  in  this  STS.)    Active  duty personnel  must  ensure  that  an  experienced  BMET  supervisor  is  assigned  to  assist  the apprentice in gaining the desired confidence and proficiency.  The training schedule must be finalized  prior  to  the  Biomedical  Equipment  Technician  Apprentice  training  program  start date.  1.3. ANG/ARC unit of assignment must ship the apprenticeâ€™s BMET toolkit to the Guard or Reserve  liaison  at  JBSA  Ft  Sam  Houston  TX.  The  BMET  apprentice  requires  a  toolkit  to perform  follow-on  qualification  training  at  the  scheduled  regional  MERC.  (NOTE:  All BMETs  in  the  active,  Guard,  and  Reserve  require  an  AF  standard  issue  toolkit  to  perform duties during peacetime and contingency operations. ARC BMETs are issued a toolkit from their  unit  of  assignment.)  Four  weeks  before  the  apprentice  graduates  from  the  apprentice course, the senior air reserve/health, technician will ship the BMET tool kit to the Guard or Reserve  liaison  depending  upon  which  component  the  apprentice  is  assigned.  The  guard liaison can be reached at DSN 420-2658.  The address is as follows:    64   Air National Guard/Reserve Component Liaison  2931 Harney Rd Second Floor JBSA-Ft Sam Houston, TX 78234  1.4.  To  ensure  continuity  between  BMET  resident  training  and  qualification  training  at  the regional MERC, the student will forward a copy of his or her technical school certificate to his or her unit of assignment.  The ANG/ARC unit of assignment will then initiate upgrade action using  AF  Form  2096  to  award  the  3-skill  level  and  enter  the  apprentice  in  the  appropriate training status code.  1.5. The apprentice BMET AFSC upgrade training requirements may be accomplished at his or  her  civilian  MTF  under  the  direct  supervision  of  an  experienced,  qualified  BMET supervisor.    If  the  apprentice  BMET  is  employed  as  a  BMET  in  the  civilian  sector,  has immediate access to the same types of biomedical equipment identified in this STS, and does not  receive  the  appropriate  number  of  qualification  training  days  necessary  to  successfully complete  all  core  tasks,  then  this  training  may  be  accomplished  at  the apprenticeâ€™s  civilian MTF  under  the  direct  supervision  of  a  qualified  BMET.    The  apprentice  must  present  the supervisor with his or her original copy of the Biomedical Equipment Technician STS.  As the required core tasks are successfully completed, the supervisor is authorized to sign-off on the STS indicating that the apprentice has satisfactorily completed each core task.  1.6.  The  medical  AFRC/ANG  unit  may  submit  a  waiver  to  bypass  the  above  qualification training if proficiency days are unavailable.  In the case where qualification training days are unavailable  at  the  base  and  the  headquarters,  the  proficiency  training  may  be  waived  until such time that days become available and the apprentice has an opportunity to train on the equipment identified in this STS.  The waiver package must be sent to the AF 4A2 Career Field Manager, Air Force Medical Logistics Office, Ft. Detrick, MD through HQ AFRC/ANG Biomedical Equipment Functional Manager.  The AFRC Functional Manager can be reached at DSN 497-1893; the ANG Functional Manager can be reached at DSN 278-8577.  65   SECTION F, DOCUMENTATION OF TRAINING   (NOTE: Compare to AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training)  1.  Work Center Training Plans.  The purpose of this section is to provide guidelines and examples of proper documentation for the many electronic forms used in training all enlisted medical  personnel.    Training  documentation  helps  to  assess  readiness  capability,  as  well,  as individual strengths and weaknesses.  It also aids in compliance with all The Joint Commission and  other  regulatory  requirements,  as  applicable.    The  enlisted  training  documentation  has migrated  from  the  hard  copy  to  electronic  AFTR.    AFTR  is  accessible  from  the  Advance Distance Learning Service via the Air Force Portal. Refer to your unit training manager (UTM) for the most current policies and guidance on training documentation.   2.  Air Force Training Record.  The AFTR is an enterprise-wide custom training management system  designed  to  replace  the  paper-based  training  records  system.    It  is  the  electronic equivalent of an AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder, and will be used by career fields within the AFMS to document all training actions.  The AFTR allows training plans to be established by Career Field/AFSC, duty position/team member, trainee/trainer/certifier, and any group of tasks that require management, tracking, and documentation.  The AFTR components managed by the supervisor are:   2.1. Master Task List (MTL).  The MTL is a list containing all the tasks that are to be trained in a work center and is often broken out by specialty.  The MTL consists of the STS; AF Form 623  Parts  II  and  III,  AF  Form  797,  Job  Qualification  Standard  Continuation/Command  JQS and  AF  Form  1098,  Special  Task  Certification  and  Recurring  Training;  and  Qualification Training Packages (QTPs). The supervisor creates the MTL by selecting tasks from the Unit Task List produced by the UTM and the STS.   2.2. Master Training Plan (MTP).  The MTP is a list containing a schedule of training for all tasks within a particular duty position.  The MTP consists of the STS; 623 Parts II and III; AF Force  Forms  797  and  1098  tasks;  and  QTPs.    The  supervisor  creates  the  MTP  by  assigning training times and methods to tasks in the duty position. Refer to AFI 36-2201 and AFH 36-2235,  Volume  11,  Information  for  Designers  of  Instructional  Systems  Application  to  Unit Training, for guidance in developing the MTP.   2.3. Duty Task List (DTL).  The DTL is a list containing all the tasks to be trained in a duty position.  The DTL consists of the STS; AF Form 623 Parts II and III; AF Force Forms 797 and 1098 tasks; and QTPs. The supervisor creates the DTL by selecting tasks from the MTL.   2.4. Individual Training Record (ITR).  All training is documented in the ITR.  This is the electronic version of the former Enlisted Training and Competency Folder.  The ITR is made up of the AF Form 623 Parts I, II and III; AF Forms 623a, 797, 803 and 1098; QTPs and the JQS.  This record is automatically populated based upon the duty position the individual is assigned to.  Refer to AFI 36-2201 for guidance in documenting training on the various forms contained within the ITR.  Maintenance of the CFETP is mandatory for all assigned MSgts and below.   2.4.1.  The  AFTR  provides  the  capability  to  incorporate  training  source  documents  and/or  to manually enter completed training into the ITR.  The following documents will be incorporated into the ITR:   2.4.1.1. The memberâ€™s initial MTF and clinic orientation checklists.   66   2.4.1.2.  Recurrent  training  such  as  Basic  Life  Support  and  Health  Insurance  Portability  and Accountability Act.  2.4.1.3. AF Form 2096, Classification/On-the-Job Training Action.   2.4.1.4. Medical Education & Training Campus (METC) Student Training Report (STR).  METC  STR  documents  the  level  of  success,  strengths,  and  weaknesses  that  a  student demonstrated during technical school.  It is emailed to the base training manager shortly after the graduate arrives at his/her duty station.  This form is maintained in the record until 5-skill level upgrade training is complete.   2.4.1.5.  AF  Form  803,  Report  of  Task  Evaluation.    AF  Form  803  is  used  to  conduct  and document completion of task evaluations during training staff assisted visits, when directed by the commander, or when a task certification requires validation.   2.4.1.6. Other forms as appropriate.   3.    Documentation  of  Training.    The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  provide  guidelines  and examples  of  proper  documentation  on  the  many  forms  used  in  training  medical  materiel personnel.  Training documentation helps to assess mission capability and readiness, individual strengths  and  weaknesses,  resources  needed  to  support  quality  patient  care,  and  defines requirements for individual career progression.   3.1. AF Form 797. The AF Form 797 (Figure 3.1) will be used to record training for tasks that are not otherwise documented in the CFETP.    67  Figure 3.1. Sample, AF Form 797 Documentation 3.2. AF Form 1098 (Figure 3.2.).  Mandatory training requirements may vary from facility to facility.  At a minimum, these requirements should be reviewed on an annual basis and updated as required.       Figure 3.2. Sample, Recurring Mandatory Training Documentation (AF Form 1098)  3.3. Qualification Training Progress Records were developed to enhance OJT.  It provides the trainer with a breakdown of task performance skills to aid in performance evaluation.  The evaluations of each task results in either a satisfactory or unsatisfactory score (Figure 3.3).     Figure 3.3. Sample, Qualification Training Progress Record 68     3.4. AF Form 623a.  Use the AF Form 623a available in the AFTR to document all progress of individual  training.  Document  on  AF  Form  623a  the  start  and  completion  dates  of  unit orientation,  and  reference  the  date  of  the  orientation  checklist.  In  addition,  document  the memberâ€™s  entry  into  upgrade  training,  initial  evaluation  results,  and  periodic  evaluations  of training  progress  to  include  CDC  progress.    Information  on  extensions,  waiver  requests,  or breaks  in  training  should  be  clearly  documented.    Document  on  the  AF  Form  623a  any decertification  proceedings,  including  dates,  reasons  for  decertification,  and  other  applicable information.  Accomplish an initial evaluation when a new person arrives to the unit or when an individual changes duty positions.  Document all other actions pertaining to training IAW AFI-36-2201.    NOTE:  Templates  for  documentation  of  orientation,  initial  upgrade  training  brief, upgrade  training  documentation,  sample  job  description  review,  and  etcetera  are  housed  in AFTR.  69
