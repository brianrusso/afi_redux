When available at the MTF and MH staff is properly trained, use the Behavioral Health  Data  Portal  (BHDP)  to  track  outcome  measure  on  all  MH  and  ADAPT beneficiaries IAW Assistant Secretary of Defense/Health Affairs Memorandum, Military Treatment Facility Mental Health Outcomes Guidance, 9 September 2013.  (T-0).   Initial training for the AF BHDP launch will be conducted by AFMOA contract trainers at each MTF MH clinic.   Thereafter, sustainment  training  will be provided by  local  MTF staff.  (T-1). 2.6.  Mental  Health  Case  Management.  MH  Case  Management  manages  the  MH  needs  of high risk patients and others as necessary.  (T-1).  If staffing permits, a single MH staff member can be assigned to manage these functions.  (T-1).  If not, the provider who placed the referral for MH care off base acts as the case manager.  MH case Management duties include: (T-1). 2.6.1.  Tracking & Care Coordination of MH Referrals.  2.6.1.1.  MH  Referrals  to  the  Network  for  service  members  are  reviewed  by  MH  to determine if the service requested is available in the MTF within access standards.  (T-1).  If  the  services  are  not  available,  then  the  MH  Flight  Commander  or  his/her  designee defers patients to the network via the Referral Management Center (RMC).  (T-1).  The MH  Case  Management  function  ensures  all  Regular  Air  Force  or  service  members  that are active patients in the clinic and referred off base are seen quarterly for tracking and monitoring for compliance to treatment/fitness for duty.  (T-1).  If the member is a patient in the MHC, then their PMHP will provide case management.  (T-1).  If the primary care provider  placed  a  psychiatry  referral,  a  request  should  be  made  for  Behavioral  Health Optimization Program (BHOP) staff to case manage those patients.  (T-1). 2.6.2.  Reviews documentation of external MH care for MHC patients.  (T-1).  For non-MHC patients,  the  primary  care  team  is  responsible  for  reviewing  external  MH  notes.

Clinic Case Management of Special MH Cases:  2.6.9.1.  The MH case manager may not be able to manage cases with a potential conflict of interest.  These special cases are directly referred to the SGH who leads a meeting to review the case and determine the final disposition.  (T-1).   2.6.9.1.1.  If the SGH agrees with the referral, the RMC defers the case directly to the network without MH review.  (T-1). 2.6.9.1.2.  The PCM teams must case manage these patients with the assistance of the Medical  Case  Manager  or  BHOP  behavioral  health  care  facilitator  (BHCF).    (T-1).  The Medical Case Manager or BHCF ensures the member is evaluated by the PCM at least  quarterly  for  tracking  and  monitoring  for  compliance  to  treatment/fitness  for duty.  (T-1). 2.6.9.2.  In  cases  where  a  high  risk  MH  patient  has  medical  issues  that  might  require civilian  specialty  referrals,  the  Medical  Case  Manager  and  MHC  co-manage  these  high risk patients.   2.7.  MCCC meeting: 2.7.1.  MCCC  is  held  weekly  to  coordinate  the  care  of  HIL  patients,  complex  patients  who are involved in multiple elements within the MH Flight, and track off base MH referrals for service members.  An MCCC log will be created to document the meeting.  (T-1). 2.7.2.  Sufficient  information  necessary  to  coordinate  care,  and  manage  risk  is  to  be  shared with all MHC personnel, and will be documented in the electronic health record (EHR).  (T-1).  2.7.2.1.  As an option  for MH  Flights with 25 or more privileged providers, the MCCC meeting can be divided into two teams modeled after the patient centered medical home approach.  In this method, the MH element is separated into two teams each consisting of therapists,  mental  health  specialty  medication  prescribers,  and  technicians.    Each  team has their own MCCC meeting with one representative from each of the ADAPT and FAP elements.    The  ADAPT  and  FAP  elements  will  have  a  process  in  place  to  share  the information  discussed during  each of the MCCC meetings  with  all the  providers within their respective elements.  (T-1). 2.7.3.  The MCCC log is not shared outside MH, with the exception of the HIL portion which is shared with PCMs weekly.  (T-1).   2.7.4.  Clinical  notes  documenting  the  MCCC  that  include  coordination  with  FAP  services are entered into the individual’s electronic MH record and into the FAP record.  (T-1). 2.8.  No Show/Noncompliance with Treatment. 2.8.1.  If a patient refuses to continue treatment and/or to schedule a follow-up appointment as recommended by the MHP, the provider documents the encounter and the decision by the patient to refuse services.  (T-1).  The MHP completes a summary of treatment in the EHR.  (T-0).  AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 19 2.8.2.  If, in the provider’s judgment, the failure to continue care results in risk to the patient, others,  or  the  military  mission,  the  MHP  will  contact  the  patient’s  Commander  and communicate concerns regarding increased risk and discuss the possible need for a CDE to answer  questions  such  as  safety,  ability  to  perform  the  mission,  deployability,  or fitness/suitability  for  continued  military  service.    (T-1).    In  addition,  the  provider  should consider  the  need  for  an  AF  Form  469,  Duty  Limiting  Conditions  Report,  to  restrict  PCS, duty, and/or mobility.  If the member is going to PCS and refuses to follow up with MH care at the gaining base, then the provider shall notify Command.  A sample notification letter can be found on MH Branch KX.  (T-1). 2.8.3.  At  the  provider’s  discretion,  voluntary  patients  currently  not  at  clinically  significant suicide risk who no show, may be considered for case closure after 3 valid attempts (phone calls and/or letter) to reach the patient.  (T-1). 2.8.3.1.  No shows can be included in overall MDG no shows and Command notifications as long as MH no shows are not differentiated from other MDG no shows and no HIPAA information is released.   2.9.  Patient Transfer/Termination. 2.9.1.  Closure  or  transfer  notes  must  be  completed  and  uploaded  or  scanned  into  the  EHR and marked sensitive upon completion or transfer of MH care IAW DoDI 6490.10 and this instruction.    (T-0).    A  sample  MH  Record  Termination-Transfer  of  Care  Summary  can  be found  on  AF/SG  Mental  Health  KX  site  and  is  recommended  to  assist  with  meeting  DoDI 6490.10 documentation requirements. 2.9.2.  The MH Flight will be included on the installation out-processing checklist to screen Service  member’s  records.    (T-0).    MH  technicians  will  review  the  out  processing  list  and will screen the EHR for any MH Flight/BHOP treatment during the last 180 days, including care received during deployment or temporary duty assignment.  (T-0).   2.9.3.  If this screen is  positive, a MHP will review the  record to  assure:   care received has been appropriately terminated and there is no need for ongoing follow up.  (T-0). 2.9.4.  Transfer  of  MH  information  will  be  accomplished  IAW  DODI  6490.10  and  this instruction.    (T-0).    When  transferring  to  a  new  command,  transfer  of  clinical  care  of  a Service member receiving MH care within the MTF system shall be arranged through direct MHP-to-MHP communication via secure methods (e.g., telephone call or encrypted e-mail), as clinically indicated by the losing MHP.  (T-0). This communication must be documented within the EHR. 2.9.4.1.  If the Behavioral  Health Data Portal (BHDP) is  available, the losing MHP will utilize  the  PCS  Flag  which  tracks  SMs  that  are  in  need  of  continued  behavioral  health care when they reach their next duty station.  Within a month of the anticipated PCS, the losing  provider  should  complete  a  transfer  summary  and  enter  it  into  the  EHR.    The transfer summary must contain information about the kind of follow-up care the patient will  need  at  the  gaining  installation,  whether  ongoing  treatment  is  deemed  necessary  to ensure mission safety, and the anticipated arrival date to the new installation.  (T-1). 2.9.5.  The MHP at the receiving location shall have a level of expertise consistent with the patient’s mental health needs and treatment plan.  (T-0).  20 AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 2.9.6.  The  MHC  at  the  gaining  base  will  track  transferred  MH  patients  with  an  open  MH case  in  the  MCCC  meeting.    The  gaining  installation  should  generate  a  report  within  the BHDP of incoming SMs due to their installation within the coming month and review it for cases  identified  as  needing  follow-up  MH  care.    The  gaining  MH  clinic  will  assist  in scheduling an appointment at the gaining MH clinic prior to the SMs PCS.  The gaining MH clinic  shall  also  track  no-shows  for  any  flagged  SM  on  the  PCS  list.    If  a  flagged  SM  no-shows for the scheduled appointment (or, for reasons beyond control, arrives at the gaining base  without  an  appointment),  the  gaining  MH  clinic  will  contact  the  SM  to  arrange  an appointment.    If  the  MHP  is  unable  to  contact  the  SM  then  the  SM's  Commander  will  be notified  if  adherence  to  treatment  is  deemed  necessary  to  ensure  mission  readiness  and  or safety based on information obtained from the MHP.   2.9.6.1.  Once an adequate hand-off has occurred, the gaining MH provider shall indicate the  handoff  within  the  BHDP  via  the  drop-down  menu  (behavioral  health  appointment attended, patient declined appointment, contact attempted etc.) which will alert the losing MH Clinic that the handoff has occurred.   2.9.6.2.  In cases where SMs have been flagged by their losing MH providers as being in need of follow-on care but then refuse to schedule a follow-up appointment with the MH Clinic  at  the  gaining  base,  the  gaining  MH  Clinic  shall  alert  the  SM's  Commander  and discuss the need for a CDE only if the losing provider determined that ongoing treatment is necessary to ensure mission readiness and/or safety. (T-1).   2.9.7.  For transfer cases, the patient:   2.9.7.1.  Shall  be  made  aware  of  available  resources  for  care  during  and  after  the  PCS, separation or retirement to ensure continuity of care during transition.  (T-0). 2.9.7.2.  Shall  be  provided  with  the  losing  and  gaining  command’s  contact  information and emergency contact information from the time of travel during transition.  (T-0).    2.9.7.3.  Shall  be  provided  the  name  of  a  MHP  at  the  gaining  base,  contact  information and  an  appointment.    (T-0).    If  the  patient  is  separating  or  retiring  from  service  or  the patient  is  a  family  member,  they  are  responsible  for  providing  contact  information  of  a provider with whom they have established follow up care. 2.9.7.4.  If the patient is a service member, then the member may choose to utilize the “In Transition”  program  as  described  in  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Health  Affairs Memorandum, “Department of Defense in Transition Program”, dated January 12, 2010. (Information  on  the  in  Transition  mental  health  coaching  and  support  program  is available at http://www.health.mil/InTransition/default.aspx).   2.10.  Termination. 2.10.1.  For  patients  involved  with  multiple  MHPs,  document  coordination/collaboration regarding case closure.  (T-1). 2.10.2.  The decision to close a case is based on clinical indications and not simply due to a move or for administrative convenience.  (T-1). 2.10.3.  Patients receiving FAP services at the time of contemplated closure of the MH record must be staffed with the FAP provider(s) prior to closure/transfer, with consultation noted in the written MH record.  (T-1).  AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 21 2.11.  Peer Review. 2.11.1.  A minimum of 5% of routine cases and 100% of HIL cases seen in the last 30 days must  be  reviewed  per  provider  per  month  and  the  provider  and  departments  must  receive feedback IAW AFI 44-119.  (T-1). 2.11.2.  A  professional  peer  is  defined  as  a  professional  with  similar  training,  clinical experience and AFSC IAW AFI 44-119. (T-1) 2.11.3.  All    MHCs  will  utilize  the    Monthly  Mental  Health  Peer  Review  template (Attachment 5) for both MH and ADAPT patients.  (T-1).   2.11.4.  BHOP providers will be peer reviewed only by another BHOP trained provider using the BHOP Peer Review template (Attachment 6).  (T-1). 2.11.5.  The reviewing provider  advises the treating provider of the identified discrepancies for process improvement.  Correctable actions should be completed same day, when possible, but not later than one duty day.  (T-1). 2.12.  Suitability and Fitness Determinations. 2.12.1.  Military  personnel  must  be  fit  and  suitable  for  their  assigned  duty,  both  physically and psychologically.  MHPs  will make determinations on fitness and suitability  for duty or deployment regarding MH disorders and the individual’s ability to perform job-related duties and relate effectively, accomplish mission tasks and tolerate environmental stressors.  (T-0). 2.12.2.  Certain duty statuses, such as PRP/PSP, weapons bearing, security clearances and/or flight  status,  have specific requirements for medical  fitness  and suitability.  MH will notify and advise Flight Medicine anytime a patient on flight status is seen.  (T-0).  Flight Medicine will  clear  the  member  prior  to  resuming  flight  duties  IAW  AFI  48-123,  Medical Examinations and Standards.    Notifications are also required for Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)  crewmembers,  air traffic  controllers,  weapons  controllers/directors,  combat controllers and Aerospace Control and Warning Systems, Tactical Air Control Party and Air Liaison Officer.  (T-0). 2.12.3.  Conditions  that  result  in  persistent  or  recurrent  duty  impairment,  preclude deployment,  or  require  continuing  treatment  for  adequate  functioning  may  require  an  MEB or administrative separation IAW AFI 48-123.  (T-0).  MHPs will advise Commanders when Service  members  are  either  unsuitable  for  continued  service  IAW  DODI  1332.14,  Enlisted Administrative  Separations;  AFI  36-3208,  Administrative  Separation  of  Airmen,  and  this instruction,  or  unfit  for  continued  service  IAW  DODI  1332.18,  Physical  Disability Evaluation .  (T-0). 2.13.  Mobility Restrictions and Duty Limiting Conditions (DLCs). 2.13.1.  Providers will evaluate and annotate a patient’s suitability and fitness for duties and deployability at every clinical contact.  (T-1).  Any change in status must be accompanied by appropriate justification and rationale.  (T-1). 2.13.2.  Prescribing providers are required to initiate an AF Form 469 profile when managing care  involving  the  disqualifying  medications  listed  in  the  Health  Affairs  Memorandum Clinical  Practice  Guidance  for  Deployment-Limiting  Mental  Disorders  and  Psychotropic  22 AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 Medications  dated  7  Oct  2013,  paragraph  3.e.1-6.    Members  who  are  taking  these medications are not eligible for waiver.  (T-0). 2.13.3.  Providers are  required to  initiate  an AF  Form 469 or medical  profile when patients are diagnosed with psychotic or bipolar disorders or other disorders with associated psychotic symptoms.    These  conditions  are  unfitting  for  military  service  and  disqualifying  for deployment and not eligible for waiver.  (T-0). 2.13.4.  If, in  the clinical  judgment of the MHP the MH condition  is  expected to  worsen or physical  trauma  is  likely  to  have  grave  medical  outcome  or  negative  impact  on  mission execution; the MH condition is not stable and is anticipated to worsen during deployment in light  of  the  physical,  physiological,  physiological,  and  nutritional  effects  of  the  duties  and location; ongoing MH care or medication is anticipated to be needed for the duration of the deployment  and  are  not  available  in  theater  within  the  military  health  system;  or  the medication  indicated  requires  special  handling,  storage  or  other  requirements,  is  not  well tolerated  within  harsh  environmental  conditions  and  could  cause  significant  side  effects  in the  setting  of  moderate  dehydration;  or  if  there  is  there  an  anticipated  need  for  routine evacuation from theater for continued diagnostics or other evaluations, the MHP will use AF Form 469 to initiate a mobility restriction recommendation.  (T-0). 2.13.4.1.  Providers, to include MHPs, will not notify an Airmen’s Commander when an Airman  self-refers  or  is  medically  referred  for  mental  health  care  or  substance misuse/abuse  education  services  unless  disclosure  is  authorized,  as  described  in  DODI 6490.08  and  paragraph  6.6.1.1  through  6.6.1.9.  of  this  Instruction.    (T-0).  If  Command notification  is  not  warranted,  an  AF  Form  469  will  not  be  created  for  the  specific encounter  or  clinical  concern.  However,  providers  must  carefully  weigh  the  rigors  of potential  assignments  or  deployments  carefully  to  avoid  exacerbations  of  conditions brought on by the rigors of contingency operations IAW AFI 10-203.  (T-1). 2.13.4.2.  For a situation that might  require a deployment waiver, pursuant  to  DODI 6490.07, Enclosure 2, Section 3, an AF Form 469 must be initiated in order to inform the Airman’s Commander to initiate the waiver IAW AFI 10-203.  (T-1). 2.13.4.3.  If, in the clinical judgment of the MHP, the patient’s diagnosed condition is not amenable  to  treatment  and  restoration  to  abilities  to  perform  duties  required  of  their AFSC  in  garrison  and  the  patient  deployed  within  one  year  of  onset  of  treatment,  the patient will be referred to the DAWG for consideration for a RILO.   2.14.  Deployment Mental Health (DMH) Clearances. 2.14.1.  All  deploying  members’  medical  records  will  be  screened  for  MH/ADAPT/FAP visits  prior to deployment and seen for further assessment as appropriate.  (T-0). 2.14.1.1.  Regular AF members with a MH history will be screened prior to deployment and  the  results  will  be  documented  in  the  EHR.    (T-1).    MH  Record  Review  Waiver Checklists  are  available  on  the  AF/SG  MH  Branch  KX  site  and  are  recommended  to assist with screening members.   2.14.1.2.  Members  with  a  psychiatric  disorder  (excluding  those  in  paragraph  2.12.3 above) in remission or whose residual symptoms do not impair duty performance may be  AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 23 considered for deployment duties if they have demonstrated a pattern of stability without significant symptoms for at least three months prior to deployment.  (T-0).   2.14.1.2.1.  If  a  patient  with  an  open  MH  record  has  not  been  seen  in  three  months, then the patient will need to be evaluated in person by a MHP to assess stability prior to clearance.   If the chart had been closed within 3 months, the MHP will review the chart and determine if the member is cleared for deployment or requires an in person evaluation.  (T-1). 2.14.1.3.  IAW DODI 6490.07, some MH conditions  and/or treatments  usually preclude deployment.    In  general,  Service  members  with  these  conditions/treatments  shall  not deploy  unless  a  waiver  is  granted.    (T-0).    MH  Record  Review  Waiver  Checklists  are available  on  the  AF/SG  MH  Branch  KX  site  and  are  recommended  to  assist  with determining if MH patients are appropriate for deployment.   2.14.1.4.  If a Commander wishes to deploy an individual with a condition that could be disqualifying,  a  waiver  must  be  submitted  to  the  applicable  Combatant  Commander through the individual’s servicing military medical unit.  (T-0). 2.14.1.5.  IAW DODI  6490.03,  Deployment  Health, and DODI  6490.13,  at  a minimum, all  Service  members  deploying  OCONUS,  for  more  than  30  days,  to  a  location  with  a non-fixed  MTF  will  receive  a  pre-deployment  neurocognitive  baseline  assessment utilizing  the  designated  DOD  neurocognitive  assessment  instrument  within  12  months prior to deployment and at each of the following deployment phases:  (T-0). 2.14.1.6.  PRE-DEPLOYMENT.    Perform  a  pre-deployment  baseline  neurocognitive assessment  within  the  12  months  before  deployment  using  the  designated  DOD neurocognitive assessment instrument.  (T-0).  2.14.1.7.  POST-INJURY.    Perform  a  neurocognitive  assessment  following  a  diagnosed concussion or mild TBI (mTBI) in  accordance with DODI 6490.11, DODI 6490.13, the Defense  Centers  of  Excellence  for  Psychological  Health  (DCoE)  clinical  practice recommendation,  Indications  and  Conditions  for  In-Theater  Post-Injury  Neurocognitive Assessment Tool Testing, and the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and website, http://www.dcoe.health.mil/TraumaticBrainInjury/TBI_Information.aspx.  (T-0). Traumatic Brain Injury 2.14.1.7.1.  Post-injury  neurocognitive  assessments  will  be  compared  to  Service member  baseline  neurocognitive  assessments,  when  available,  to  inform  return-to-duty decisions by medical providers.  To request baseline neurocognitive assessments during  deployment,  medical  providers  will  call  or  email  the  Neurocognitive Assessment  Branch  helpdesk (855)  630-7849,  DSN  471-9242  or usarmy.jbsa.medcom.mbx.otsg--anam-baselines@mail.mil.  (T-0). at 2.14.1.7.2.  Post-injury  evaluations  on  Service  members  without  baseline neurocognitive assessments may be compared to pre-deployment-relevant norms.   2.14.1.8.  POST-DEPLOYMENT.   Upon  return  from  deployment,  those  Service members who respond affirmatively to the TBI risk assessment questions on the PDHA contained  in  DODI  6490.03,  will  be  referred  for  further  clinical  evaluation  that  may include the administration of a neurocognitive assessment.  (T-0).  24 AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 2.14.1.8.1.  IAW  DODI  6490.13.,  paragraph  3.f.,  civilian  expeditionary  workforce employees  will  be  screened  for  cognitive  changes  in  the  same  manner  as  military service  members  to  the  extent  practical  and  consistent  with  DODD  1410.10,  DOD Civilian Expeditionary Workforce.  (T-0). 2.14.1.9.  Neurocognitive assessment measures other than the ANAM may only be used if authorized by a waiver granted by the Assistant Secretary of Defense.  (T-0). 2.14.1.10.  Assessment and Disposition during Deployments: 2.14.1.10.1.  Members  diagnosed  with  psychotic  or  bipolar  disorders  or  other disorders  with  psychotic  symptoms  during  deployment  should  return  to  their  home station.  (T-0). 2.14.1.10.2.  Members  who  are  determined  to  be  at  significant  risk  for  performing poorly  or  decompensating  in  the  operational  environment  or  whose  condition  does not improve within a reasonable time should be evacuated from theater.  (T-0). 2.15.  Overseas Clearances for Service members. 2.15.1.  Compliance with the current medical review process for each location is mandatory.  (T-1).    Assignment  to  certain  remote  and  overseas  bases  requires  more  stringent  clearance processes and approval.   2.16.  Family Member Relocation Clearances (FMRCs).  MHPs support the FMRC process as clinical consultants where MH or substance abuse issues are identified, IAW AFI 40-701.  (T-1).  MHPs advise as needed on either outbound or inbound Facility Determination Inquiries (FDIs).  The FAO or designee supports the FMRC process where FAP services are identified.  (T-1). 2.16.1.  When MH identifies conditions that meet criteria for EFMP enrollment, MH makes mandatory referral to the EFMP Medical (EFMP-M) office, IAW AFI 36-2110 and AFI 40-701.  (T-1). 2.17.  Family Child Care Applications. 2.17.1.  AFI 34-276, Family Child Care Programs, requires MH, FAP and ADAPT to assist the Family Child Care panel in their decisions on licensure for day care providers.  (T-1). 2.17.2.  MH  Flight  Commanders  develop  procedures  for  record  search/review  for  Family Child Care applicants.  Applications may be reviewed by a 5-level or higher MH technician.  If no Potentially Disqualifying  Information (PDI) is  found, then the technician can sign the form.  If PDI is noted, the application is referred to a privileged MHP for review.  (T-1).  The role of the MH staff in the background screening process is to provide information that may preclude  the  selection  of  an  applicant  for  any  position  (paid  or  volunteer)  working  with children.    MH  staff  members  do  not  assess  the  suitability  of  the  applicant,  nor  do  they approve  or  disapprove  the  applicant  for  such  positions.    MHPs  will  provide  details  of  the incident or state the diagnosis to the requesting DOD agency only with appropriate release of information.  (T-1). 2.17.3.  A signed release is provided by the applicant prior to the record review.  (T-1). 2.18.  Special  Clearances.  MH  staff  may  be  required  to  assist  in  clearances  for  special  duties [such as MTI/MTL, Survival Evasion Resistance Escape (SERE), Sniper school, recruiting duty, Independent  Duty  Medical  Technician  (IDMT)  etc.].    A  signed  consent  for  the  release  of  AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 25 confidential information is not required to disclose fitness for duty information to command, per DOD  6025.18-R.    (T-1).    Requests  for  clearances  are  considered  personnel  evaluations  rather than MH evaluations, but a clinical note will be placed in the EHR.  (T-1). 2.19.  Personnel Reliability Program (PRP)/Presidential Support Program (PSP). 2.19.1.  For  personnel  being  certified,  recertified  or  otherwise  evaluated  for  PRP/PSP,  the entire health record (hard copy and electronic) must be reviewed in order to determine if PDI exists (e.g.,  FAP,  MH,  ADAPT, relevant  medical  problems, MH issues  treated by  a PCM).  (T-0).  Ensure emergency department (ED) documentation and Personal Health Assessments (PHAs) documentation is thoroughly reviewed.  (T-0).  In addition, review Part III of the SF Form 93, Report of Medical History, as well as DD Forms 2807-1, Report of Medical History and 2807-2, Medical Prescreen of Report of Medical History in order to screen for responses made  about  prior-to-service  behaviors  or  events  that  indicate  discrepancies  or  potential disqualification.  (T-0). 2.19.2.  Consult  DODI  5210.42  Regulation  and  AFMAN  10-3902  for  more  information  on selection, evaluation, treatment and reporting of PRP/PSP personnel.   2.20.  On-Call Procedures. 2.20.1.  MHPs will provide consultation to Commanders after established duty hours.  (T-1).  MHPs  offer  recommendations  on  managing  crisis  situations  to  Commanders,  law enforcement agencies, first sergeants and other helping agencies.  (T-1). 2.20.2.  After-hours MH assessments will only be conducted in an ED or Urgent Care Clinic (UCC).  At installations without an ED or UCC, emergencies will be handled similar to other acute medical emergencies using community medical resources.  (T-1).   2.20.3.  Occasionally, MHPs may be asked to meet a Commander at the crisis scene.  On-call providers  and/or  MH  personnel  may  recommend  response  options  but  will  not  conduct patient  assessment  or  provide  intervention  at  the  scene.    On-call  providers  and/or  MH personnel  will  not  be  directed  to  engage  with  individuals  exhibiting  threatening  behaviors.  (T-1).  Personnel requiring evaluation must be taken to the ED by the member’s command.  Emergency  response  personnel  or  Security  Forces/law  enforcement  will  be  consulted  as appropriate for assistance.  (T-1). 2.20.4.  MHPs may be required to evaluate inmates in AF base confinement facilities in the rare  instances  that  a  detainee/inmate  is  placed  on  suicide  watch  by  the  confinement  officer and  the  MHC  is  closed  during  the  mandated  evaluation  requirement  IAW  AFI  31-205  (as soon as possible and within the first 24 hours of the initiation of segregation and a minimum of  every  24  hours  after  the  initial  segregation).    The  detainee/inmate  will  require  a  full clinical  assessment.    Since  there  are  notable  concerns  about  privacy/confidentiality  and emergent medical care availability within the confinement setting itself, clearly the preferred method  would  be  to  transfer  the  inmate  (in  shackles  if  needed)  to  the  MHC  if  the  MHC  is open.  (T-1).   26 AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 Chapter 3 MH TREATMENT PROCEDURES 3.1.  Transporting Patients in Crisis (during duty and after-duty hours). 3.1.1.  If an emergent  evaluation  is  conducted at  the MHC,  the  requesting Commander will provide an escort for the patient.  (T-1). 3.1.2.  MH  does  not  provide  manpower  for  the  transportation  of  any  MH  patients.    This responsibility  lies  with  the  Commander.    If  the  situation  warrants  assistance  from  Security Forces/law  enforcement  then  a  response/request  will  be  properly  coordinated  through  the Base Defense Operation Center.   MH will assist with the coordination as appropriate.  The exception is the use of MH technicians to aid in air evacuation of certain categories of MH patients on military airlift.  (T-1).   3.1.3.  If  an  emergent  evaluation  is  conducted  at  the  MHC  or  at  the  request  of  another medical  clinic,  the  requesting  clinic  staff  should  escort  the  patient  to  the  MHC  and  the requesting provider should call the MHP to perform a provider to provider hand off.  (T-1).   3.2.  Clinical Management of Suicidal Patients. 3.2.1.  MHPs will implement clinical practices IAW currently published AFMOA guidance, unless otherwise clinically indicated.  (T-1). 3.2.1.1.  All patients will be given the appropriate AFMOA approved preliminary suicide screening instrument prior to each MH appointment.  (T-1). 3.2.1.2.  MHPs will make an informed decision about suicide risk based on all available data and document rationale for classifying risk level.  (T-1). 3.2.2.  MHPs must communicate risk level as appropriate with command.  (T-1). 3.2.3.  MHPs  will  carefully  evaluate  every  Airman  with  a  recent  suicide  attempt  for  both ongoing  care  and  fitness/suitability  for  continued  duty.    (T-1).    Following  any  service member  suicide  attempt,  the  MTF  SGH  will  lead  a  meeting  with  the  member’s  MHP  and PCM to review the case and determine the medical disposition of the individual.  (T-1).  An Airman  with  a  potentially  medically  disqualifying  diagnosis  will  be  discussed  at  the Deployment  Availability  Working  Group  (DAWG)  to  determine  if  an  RILO  and consideration  for  an  MEB  is  warranted,  or  processing  for  an  administrative  separation  is more  suitable  due  to  a  personality  disorder  or  other  unsuitable  condition.    For  suicide attempts  by  ARC  members,  a  fitness  for  duty  determination  will  be  instituted  (See AFRC/SGP Consolidated Program Memorandum).  (T-1). 3.2.4.  Every  mental  health  evaluation  or  treatment  case  in  which  a  Service  member ultimately  commits  an  act  resulting  in  suicide,  homicide,  serious  injury,  or  significant violence will be systematically reviewed.  (T-0).  The findings will be used to inform patient care process,  risk management, and technical competence of staff members.  (T-0).  To the extent  this  review  by  the  MTF  constitutes  peer  review,  it  is  privileged  under  10  U.S.C.  § 1102.  AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 27 3.2.4.1.  Every review will focus upon the assessment, treatment, and clinical progress of the Service member, as well as the administrative recommendations and follow-through.  (T-0).    Quality  reviews  will  be  documented  in  the  risk  management  record,  and  if appropriate, the credentials record.  (T-0). 3.2.5.  MHPs  will  initiate  a  fitness  for  duty  determination  for  suicide  attempts  by  ARC members and notify HQ AFRC/SGP at Robins AFB, GA about all suicide attempts by AFR personnel to ensure proper disposition.  (T-1). 3.2.6.  MH  personnel  will  accomplish  the  DOD  Suicide  Event  Report  (DODSER)  for  all suicide  attempts  resulting  in  medical  care  including  mental  health  care.    (T-0).    For completed  suicides,  entries  should  not  be  entered  into  DODSER  until  the  Armed  Forces Medical Examiner makes a determination about the manner of death. 3.3.  High Interest List (HIL)  3.3.1.  HIL status reflects a provider’s judgment that heightened monitoring is indicated and meets  the  notification  criteria  discussed  in  paragraph    6.6.1.  of  this  AFI  (includes  but  not limited  to  increased  risk  of  harm  to  self  or  others,  or  harm  to  mission).    Therefore,  any patient, including those seen in ADAPT and FAP, meeting these criteria can be categorized as high interest.  (T-1). 3.3.2.  Patients assessed to be at a serious risk of self-harm (clinically significant suicide risk) will be added to the HIL.  (T-1). 3.3.3.  The HIL serves as a communication strategy for coordinating care, closely monitoring the  improvement  and/or  exacerbation  of  symptoms,  and  ensuring  timely  delivery  of treatment.   3.3.4.  The PMHP is generally responsible for entering and removing their patients from the HIL.    When  adding  patients  to  the  HIL,  in  order  to  facilitate  coordination  of  care  and  to address limiting access to means, trained/certified staff notify the patient’s PCM and the on-call MHP, and the Commander or First Sergeant (if military) the same duty day (or NLT the next  duty  day  if  after  duty  hours).    A  HIL  Hospitalization  Checklist  is  available  on  the AF/SG MH Branch KX site and is recommended to assist with tracking HIL patients.   3.3.5.  At  a  minimum,  the  HIL  contains  the  name  of  the  patient,  PMHP  responsible  for  the coordination of the patient’s care, date  entered onto  HIL, diagnosis, nature and level  of the risk  (e.g.  risk  factors,  specific  concerns),  PCM,  command  representative  and  the  next scheduled follow-up appointment.  (T-1). 3.3.6.  The MHCs shall forward the HIL to the PCMs weekly.  (T-1).  MDG members who meet the HIL criteria are also included on the HIL.  (T-1).  The designated MHP will meet with PCMs at least monthly to discuss all HIL cases and document the meeting in the MCCC log.  (T-1).  3.3.7.  The HIL is maintained at the MH reception desk.  (T-1). 3.4.  HIL Procedures. 3.4.1.  HIL patients will be evaluated weekly, and in person when at all possible.  (T-1).  The only  exceptions  are  patients  who  are  in  a  psychiatric  hospital  or  enrolled  and  attending  28 AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 intensive  outpatient  or  partial  hospitalization  programs  since  these  patients  are  being managed by outside providers and communication exists weekly with the providers.  (T-1). 3.4.2.  A face to face treatment team meeting will be scheduled with the patient, the PMHP and the Commander/First Sergeant or their designee within seven calendar days upon entry into the HIL or discharge from the hospital, whichever is appropriate.  (T-1).  If a face to face meeting  is  not  possible,  the  treatment  team  meeting  can  be  accomplished  via  telephone  or video  teleconference.    The  treatment  team  meeting  must  be  documented  in  the  patient’s mental health record.  (T-1).  A High Interest Treatment Team Meeting template is available on the AF/SG MH Branch KX site and is recommended to assist with such documentation.   3.4.3.  Cases  on  the  HIL  are  discussed  weekly  at  the  MCCC  meeting  to  include  risk  level, progress  with  the  treatment  plan,  case  management  decisions,  and  whether  high  interest status is still warranted.  In addition, peer consultation is sought if needed.  (T-1). 3.4.4.  A special flag will identify HIL patients in the EHR.  Special flags are added in from the  demographics  section.    BH1  will  be  used  for  harm  to  others  and  BH2  will  be  used  for harm to self.  (T-1). 3.4.5.  HIL  patients  will  be  placed  on  mobility  limiting  profile  for  the  duration  of  their elevated risk, generally not less than 90 days. 3.4.6.  Names of the patients admitted to a hospital for MH or alcohol/drug reasons are added to the HIL as soon as the clinic becomes aware of the admission.  (T-1). 3.4.7.  MH  staff  coordinates  with  inpatient,  intensive  outpatient,  or  partial  hospitalization staff for continuity of care before, during (at  least  weekly,  as clinically indicated) and  after psychiatric hospitalizations.  (T-1).   3.4.8.  Once  a  member  is  discharged  from  the  hospital,  the  discharge  summary  is  uploaded into the EHR and marked as sensitive.  The MHP notifies the PCM of the discharge.  (T-1). 3.4.9.  If a service member attempts suicide, the PMHP ensures a meeting between the MHP, SGH,  and  the  PCM  occurs  IAW  AFI  41-210  in  order  to  discuss  the  most  appropriate treatment course and disposition for the member.  (T-1).  The meeting must occur within two weeks  of  discharge  from  the  inpatient  psychiatric  ward.    The  purpose  of  this  meeting  is  to discuss the appropriateness for an RILO/MEB or administrative separation and document the decision and supported information. 3.4.10.  High  Interest  Log  Walk-Ins.  If  a  HIL  patient  walks  into  the  clinic,  the  patient  is seen by on-call MHP or the PMHP if available.  (T-1).  When the PMHP anticipates being unavailable  for  an  extended  period  of  time,  the  PMHP  informs  other  providers  who  are covering any HIL patients from his or her caseload.  (T-1). 3.4.11.  High Interest Log Cancelations/No Shows. 3.4.11.1.  If a HIL patient calls the MHC for any reason, the MH staff obtains the number where the patient is calling from and connects the patient to either the patient’s PMHP or the on-call MHP, depending on which individual is available.  (T-1). 3.4.11.2.  If  a  HIL  patient  calls  to  cancel  an  appointment,  the  patient’s PMHP,  or  if  the PMHP is  not  available, the on-call MHP, speaks  directly with  the HIL patient  to  assess risk and document the reason for the cancellation.  (T-1).  AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 29 3.4.11.3.  In  order  to  ensure  that  HIL  patients  are  unable  to  cancel  their  appointments without  speaking  to  a  MHP,  ideally,  the  MH  Flight  Commander  will  disable  the appointment cancellation ability in the CHCS clinical telephone reminder system and the web based TRICARE online cancellation system.   If that is not possible, the MH Flight Commander will ensure a procedure is in place for the MHC to receive a list of the MH appointments  that  were  canceled  via  the  telephone  reminder  system  and  the  web  based TRICARE online cancellation system.  (T-1). 3.4.11.4.  If the HIL patient no shows, the MH staff contacts the PMHP immediately, and attempts to contact the member.  (T-1). 3.4.11.5.  The  Commander/First  Sergeant  or  their  designee  will  be  informed  if  contact cannot be established within one hour or the HIL patient refuses follow-up. (T-1). 3.4.11.6.  A  course  of  action  is  recommended  to  the  Commander/First  Sergeant  or  their designee by the PMHP based on the patient’s individual needs.  (T-1). 3.4.11.7.  All  attempts  to  contact  the  patient,  their  Commander/First  Sergeant  or  their designee are documented in the EHR as a telephone consult.  (T-1). 3.4.11.8.  Removing  patients  from  the  HIL  occurs  after  the  PMHP  obtains  collateral information from the command, recommends removal to the MCCC, and a collaborative decision  is  made,  but  always  requires  at  least  four  weeks  of  documented  risk  and symptom stability.  (T-1). 3.4.11.9.  If  a  service  member  who  meets  HIL  criteria,  declines  therapy,  the  PMHP should offer weekly brief sessions to provide supportive therapy and crisis management.  If  the  member  continues  to  refuse  care  or  brief  supportive  sessions,  then  the  PMHP should  discuss  patient  safety  with  command  and  offer  another  TTM  before  closing  the case.  If the member continues to refuse care, is not an imminent risk to self or others and involuntary  hospitalization  is  not  indicated,  then  the  case  is  closed  with  goals  not  met.  (T-1). 3.4.12.  HIL Special Considerations. 3.4.12.1.  If  a  dependent  or  retiree  empaneled  to  the  MTF  for  their  primary  care  is hospitalized,  the  primary  care  team  shall  track  their  progress  if  the  patient  is  not  being treated in the MTF’s MHC.  (T-1). 3.4.12.2.  When  the  patient  is  placed  on  the  HIL,  and  is  on  PRP/PSP  status,  or  holds  a Top Secret or higher clearance, is a controller, or is on flight status, the MHP will ensure that appropriate notifications to the competent medical authority (CMA) and/or program monitors are made IAW governing policies including HIPAA, DOD 5210.42-R, AFMAN 10-3902, DODI 6490.08, and AFI 48-123.  Notifications must be documented in the EHR and updated as needed.  (T-0).  3.4.12.3.  High Interest Log and military dependents or retirees.  3.4.12.3.1.  Civilian  Beneficiaries,  Dependent  Family  Members,  or  Retirees  who receive  MH  care  in  the  MHC  will  be  placed  on  the  HIL  when  meeting  other  risk criteria if they are eligible for services under any element within the MH Flight.  (T-1).    Documentation  of  case  consultation  and  clinical  interventions  is  placed  in  all applicable  charts.  (e.g.,  the  EHR  and  FAP  records).    (T-1).    All  HIL  procedures  30 AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 including  a  treatment  team  meeting  with  a  family  member  or  friend  the  patient considers  supportive  shall  be  offered  to  the  family  member  patient  but  cannot  be mandated.   If the civilian beneficiaries, dependent  family member, or retiree choose not to comply with the HIL procedures, that will be documented in their MH record.  If the patient  continues services in  the MHC,  the patient  will be tracked on the HIL and discussed during the MCCC meeting in  order to  facilitate peer consultation and knowledge sharing with on call providers.  (T-1).  It is important to obtain a release of information for a support person and contact information to be used in the event of no shows.  Ideally, the release would last until treatment or HIL monitoring is complete.  (T-1). 3.4.12.3.2.  When  the  immediate  family  member  of  a  service  member  who  is  on PRP/PSP  status  is  placed  on  the  HIL,  the  MHP  should  consider  whether,  due  to potential  stress  on  the  service  member,  the  information  should  be  disclosed  to  the service  member's  PCM.    This  ensures  the  service  member  is  provided  appropriate healthcare  and  the  service  member's  PCM  can  assess  the  member  and  determine  if there is potentially disqualifying information that must be reported to the CMA.  (T-1).  AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 31 Chapter 4 MISCELLANEOUS ROLES 4.1.  Behavioral Health Optimization Program (BHOP) Services. 4.1.1.

Funding  for sanity boards is  not  provided by DHP funds.  (T-1).  While MHPs may assist, it should be noted that as DHP funded personnel, regular patient care duties take precedence.  4.2.1.  AFI  51-301  governs  consultation  and  testimony  in  other  settings,  and  requires approval  by  the  appropriate  legal  office.  Permission  to  consult  and/or  testify  as  an  expert witness  in  non-military  justice  matters  is  not  generally  granted.    All  requests  for  testimony should be forwarded to the in-house MLC or the installation SJA.  (T-1).  4.3.  MH Prevention: 4.3.1.  Within  specialty  MHCs,  patient  care  is  top  priority.

Confidentiality:  Psychotherapist-Patient General Rule. 6.1.1.  General Rule. Communication between a patient and a psychotherapist or an assistant to  a  psychotherapist  made  for  the  purpose  of  facilitating  diagnosis  or  treatment  of  the patient’s  mental  or  emotional  condition  are  confidential  communications  and  shall  be protected from unauthorized disclosure.  (T-0).  However, confidential communications will be disclosed to persons or agencies with a proper and legitimate need for the information and who  are  authorized  by  law  or  regulation  to  receive  it,  unless  the  evidentiary  privilege described in paragraph 6.2. of this instruction applies.  (T-0).  See also the limited protections afforded confidential communications under LPSP in paragraph 6.8. of this Instruction.  (T-1). 6.1.2.  In  cases  not  arising  under  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ),  the psychotherapist  should  consult  with  the  Medical  Law  Consultant  (MLC)  and  may  appeal requests  for  confidential  communications  by  persons  or  agencies  to  the  installation  Staff Judge Advocate (SJA).  (T-1).   6.2.  Military Rule of Evidence.  This evidentiary rule provides a patient the privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing a confidential communication made between  the  patient  and  the  psychotherapist  or  an  assistant  to  the  psychotherapist,  in  a  case arising  under  the  UCMJ,  if  such  communication  was  made  for  the  purpose  of  facilitating diagnosis  or  treatment  of  the  patient’s  mental  or  emotional  condition.      (T-0).  There  is  no privilege under this rule in the following conditions:   6.2.1.  When the patient is dead.  (T-0). 6.2.2.  When the communication is evidence of child abuse or neglect, or in a proceeding in which one spouse is charged with a crime against a child of either spouse.  (T-0). 6.2.3.  When federal law, state law, or service regulation imposes a duty to report information contained in a communication.  (T-0).   6.2.4.  When  a  psychotherapist  or  assistant  to  a  psychotherapist  believes  that  a  patient’s mental  or  emotional  condition  makes  the  patient  a  danger  to  any  person,  including  the patient.  (T-0).     6.2.5.  If the communication clearly contemplated the future commission of a fraud or crime or  if  the  services  of  the  psychotherapist  are  sought  or  obtained  to  enable  or  aid  anyone  to commit or plan to  commit  what  the patient  knew or reasonably should have known to  be a crime or fraud. (T-0).    6.2.6.  When  necessary  to  ensure  the  safety  and  security  of  military  personnel,  military dependents,  military  property,  classified  information,  or  the  accomplishment  of  a  military mission. (T-0).    6.2.7.  When  an  accused  offers  statements  or  other  evidence  concerning  his/her  mental condition in defense, extenuation, or mitigation, under circumstances not covered by R.C.M. 706  or  Mil.  R  Evid.  302.    In  such  situations,  the  military  judge  may,  upon  motion,  order  AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 37 disclosure of any statement made by the accused to a psychotherapist as may be necessary in the interests of justice.  (T-0).       6.2.8.  When admission or disclosure of a communication is constitutionally required.  (T-0).     6.3.  Who May Claim the Privilege Under Military Rule of Evidence.  The privilege may be claimed by the patient  or the guardian or  conservator of the patient.   A  person who may claim privilege  may  authorize  trial  counsel  or  defense  counsel  to  claim  the  privilege  on  his  or  her behalf.  The psychotherapist or assistant to the psychotherapist who received the communication may  claim  the  privilege  on  behalf  of  the  patient.    The  authority  of  such  a  psychotherapist, assistant,  guardian,  or  conservator  to  so  assert  the  privilege  is  presumed  in  the  absence  of evidence to the contrary.  (T-0).     6.4.  Limited Applicability of Military Rule of Evidence 513.  The evidentiary privilege only applies  when  access  to  confidential  information  is  being  sought  for  the  purpose  of  a  criminal investigation or proceeding under the  UCMJ.   If  access  is  requested for  any other purpose, the evidentiary privilege has no application and the general rule in paragraph 6.1. applies.  (T-0).   6.5.  Disclosure  of  confidential  communications.  When  the  disclosure  of  confidential communications  is  requested  from  a  MHP  for  the  purpose  of  criminal  investigation  or proceedings under the UCMJ, consult the in-house MLC or the installation SJA, when there is no in-house MLC.  (T-1). 6.6.  Limits of Confidentiality:  Command Notification and Duty to Take Precautions. 6.6.1.  Command  Notification.    Presumption  of  non-notification.

Harm to  Self.  The provider believes there is  a serious risk of self-harm by the Service  member  either  as  a  result  of  the  condition  itself  or  medical  treatment  of  the condition.  (T-0). 6.6.1.2.  Harm to Others.  The provider believes there is a serious risk of harm to others either  as  a  result  of  the  condition  itself  or  medical  treatment  of  the  condition.  This includes  any  disclosures  concerning  child  abuse  or  domestic  violence  consistent  with DoD Instruction 6400.06 .  (T-0). 6.6.1.3.  Harm  to  Mission.    The  provider  believes  there  is  a  serious  risk  of  harm  to  a specific  military  operational  mission.    Such  serious  risk  may  include  disorders  that significantly impact impulsivity, insight, reliability, and judgment.   (T-0). 6.6.1.4.  Special  Personnel.    The  member  is  in  the  PRP/PSP  as  described  in  DOD 5210.42-  R  and  AFMAN  10-3902  or  is  in  a  position  that  has  been  pre-identified  by Service  regulation  or  the  command  as  having  mission  responsibilities  of  such  potential sensitivity or urgency that normal notification standards would significantly risk mission accomplishment.  (T-0).  38 AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 6.6.1.5.  Inpatient  Care.    The  Service  member  is  admitted  or  discharged  from  any inpatient MH or substance abuse treatment facility as these are considered critical points in treatment and support nationally recognized patient safety standards.  (T-0). 6.6.1.6.  Acute  Medical  Conditions  Interfering  With  Duty.

Limited Privilege Suicide Prevention (LPSP) Program. 6.8.1.  Program  Objective.    The  objective  of  the  LPSP  program  is  to  identify  and  treat  AF members who, because of the stress of impending disciplinary action under the UCJM, pose a genuine risk of suicide.  In order to encourage and facilitate treatment, the LPSP program provides limited confidentiality under the enumerated circumstances.  (T-1). 6.8.2.  Program  Eligibility.    Any  AF  member  is  eligible  for  entry  in  the  LPSP  after  the member  has  been  officially  notified,  verbally  or  in  writing  that  he  or  she  is  under investigation or is suspected of the commission of an offense under the UCMJ.  (T-1).   6.8.3.  Initiation.    If  subsequent  to  the  notification  described  in  paragraph  6.8.2.,  defense counsel, trial counsel, law enforcement official, staff judge advocate, first sergeant, squadron executive  officer  or  any  other  individual  officially  involved  in  the  processing  of  the disciplinary action in good faith believes that the member may present a risk of suicide, the individual  shall  communicate  that  concern  to  the  member’s  immediate  Commander  with  a recommendation  that  the  member  be  referred  for  a  mental  health  evaluation  and  possible placement in the LPSP program.

MH  staff  will  communicate  directly  with  Commander  or  first  sergeant  when  a service member is released from inpatient care or partial hospitalization.  (T-1).   6.10.3.  MH staff will establish new safety plans post discharge.  (T-1). 6.10.4.  If the member declines this evaluation and there is an indication of elevated risk, an emergency CDE is recommended to the Commander to ensure adequate safety assessment of the member.  (T-1). 6.10.5.  If MHPs become aware of a discharge that occurs during non-duty hours, the MHP collaborates with the patient’s Commander to recommend a safety plan and set up a time for the patient to be evaluated in the MHC during the next duty day.  (T-1). 6.11.  Administrative Separations. 6.11.1.  When  a  MH  evaluation  results  in  a  recommendation  for  administrative  separation, the  MHP  must  determine  if  the  recommendation  requires  higher-level  approval.    (T-0).  Administrative separation checklists are available on the AF/SG MH Branch KX site and are recommended  to  assist  with  determining  if  MH  administrative  separation  recommendations require higher-level approval.   6.11.1.1.

We  encourage  you  to consider the following points regarding MH care and to discuss them with your MH provider if you  wish.  You  can  expect  the  attention,  respect,  and  best  professional  efforts  of  your  MH provider. Your MH provider will treat you as a responsible individual and will expect you to take an active part in your treatment. You should also expect to take part in treatment decisions.  You should understand the goals  and direction therapy is taking, and if  you do not understand, you should ask. Before initiating a professional evaluation or treatment relationship with a MH provider,  we  want  you  to  know  about  privacy  ground  rules  and  terms  of  your  treatment. Generally, information discussed during the evaluation and treatment sessions is confidential and may not ordinarily be revealed to anyone outside the clinic without your permission. Under some circumstances,  including  but  not  limited  to  those  listed  below,  information  may  be  released without your permission.  A. Records of Care for All Patients.  Every clinical visit to MH is documented in the electronic medical  record  and  marked  as  sensitive.    Generally,  only  healthcare  providers  are  allowed  to view  these  sensitive  records,  if  needed.    It  is  important  that  providers  caring  for  you  in  other clinics are aware of the care or evaluation you are receiving here.  If there is a hard copy record, the MH record of Service members will be transferred to the MH clinic at the gaining installation at  the  time  of  Permanent  Change  of  Station  (PCS).  At  the  time  of  retirement  or  separation  of Service members, the MH record will be maintained at the installation MH clinic in accordance with existing records disposition schedules.  For military dependents who are actively involved in treatment at the time of PCS, the provider will discuss the option of transferring care/records.    B. Disclosure Policy for All  Patients.   All medical and mental health records are protected by the  Privacy  Act,  HIPAA  and  other  applicable  laws/regulations.    Most  information  related  to treatment  of  military  dependents  or  retirees  is  not  releasable  without  the  patient’s  written authorization.    Some  of  the  instances  excluded  from  authorization  requirements  are  quality assurance reviews by other mental healthcare providers (MHPs) and collection of information for medical research. There may also be  instances where we are required to disclose your record in response  to  a  court  order  or  other  lawful  demand  if  an  exception  to  the  general  rule  of confidentiality  applies.    The  most  common  exceptions  which  may  require  your  mental  health provider  to  disclose  information  to  appropriate  authorities  without  your  authorization  are  as follows: 1.  Child  or  Spouse  Maltreatment.  Providers  must  report  suspected  child  abuse  or  neglect  to military  agencies  and/or  local  child  protective  authorities.  Providers  may  also  be  required  to report other family maltreatment incidents.  2.  Crimes or Fraud. Providers must report any threat to commit crimes or fraud.  3.  Danger  to  Self  or  Others.  Providers  must  take  steps  to  protect  individuals  from  harm  when they  have  reason  to  believe  there  is  a  serious  threat  to  the  life  or  safety  of  the  individual  or others.  4.  Pursuant to a court order or other lawful demand.   56 AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 5.  Sexual  Assault.    Providers  are  required  to  report  all  sexual  assaults  to  the  Sexual  Assault Response Coordinator (SARC).  C.  Disclosure  Policy  for  Service  members.  In  addition  to  the  disclosure  policies,  above, Command notification by healthcare providers that a Service member has sought and/or is in MH treatment or is taking medication is not necessarily required when an individual voluntarily seeks MH care. However, pursuant to Department of Defense Regulations, healthcare providers must notify your Commander if you meet one of the following criteria:  1. Harm to Self. The provider believes there is a serious risk of self-harm either as a result of  the condition itself or medical treatment of the condition.  2. Harm to Others. The provider believes there is a serious risk of harm to others either as a  result of the condition itself or medical treatment of the condition. This includes any disclosures concerning child abuse or domestic violence consistent with DoD regulations.  3. Harm to Mission. The provider believes there is a serious risk of harm to a specific military  operational  mission.  Such  serious  risk  may  include  disorders  that  significantly  impact impulsivity, insight, reliability, and judgment.  4. Special Personnel. The Service member is in the Personnel Reliability Program as  described in DoD Instruction 5210.42 or is in a position that has been pre-identified by Service regulation  or  the  Command  as  having  mission  responsibilities  of  such  potential  sensitivity  or urgency that normal notification standards would significantly risk mission accomplishment.  5.  Inpatient  Care.  The  Service  member  is  admitted  or  discharged  from  any  inpatient  mental health or substance abuse treatment facility. 6.  Acute  Medical  Conditions  Interfering  With  Duty.  The  Service  member  is  experiencing  an acute mental health condition or is engaged in an acute medical treatment regimen that impairs the member’s ability to perform assigned duties.  7.  Substance  Abuse  Treatment  Program.  The  Service  member  has  entered  into  or  is  being discharged  from  a  formal  outpatient  or  inpatient  treatment  program  for  the  treatment  of substance abuse or dependence.  8. Command Directed MH Evaluation. The mental health services are obtained as a result of  a command-directed mental health evaluation. 9. Other Special Circumstances. The notification is based on other special circumstances in  which  proper  execution  of  the  military  mission  outweighs  the  interests  served  by  avoiding notification, as determined on a case-by-case basis by a health care provider (or other authorized official of the medical treatment  facility involved) at  the O-6 or equivalent  level  or above or a commanding officer at the O-6 level or above.  In  making  a  disclosure  based  on  the  circumstances  described  in  subparagraphs  1-10  above, healthcare providers shall provide the minimum amount of information to satisfy the purpose of the disclosure.   D. Second Opinion Process for Service Members:  If you disagree with the recommendations made to your Commander, you can discuss this with your provider, the MTF Patient Advocate, and/or  your  Commander.  Additionally,  if  you  have  a  potentially  disqualifying  condition,  you have the option of seeking a second opinion IAW the provisions of AFI 10-203, Duty Limiting Conditions.    AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 57 E.  High  Interest  Log  (HIL).  When  a  provider  considers  a  patient  (Service  members,  retirees and  military  dependents)  to  be  a  serious  risk  for  harming  themselves  or  others,  the  patient  is placed on the MH clinic HIL.  In order to better coordinate care and ensure safety, the cases of patients  on  the  HIL  are  discussed  at  weekly  MHC  meetings,  and  the  names  are  shared  with primary  care  clinic  providers  and  the  MDG  Emergency  Department.  This  practice  is  in accordance with military and DoD policy. Your provider will inform you if/when you are placed on the HIL and when you are removed from it. Patients on the HIL will be required to speak with their  provider  for  a  brief  status  check  when  calling  the  clinic.  If  a  patient  on  the  HIL  fails  to arrive  for  a  scheduled  appointment,  the  provider  will  attempt  to  make  phone  contact.  If  the provider  cannot  locate  or  contact  the  patient  within  one  hour,  the  provider  may  contact  other persons  or  agents  in  order  to  ascertain  the  patient’s  location  and  status  in  order  to  ensure  the patient’s safety. Other persons or agents the provider might contact include, but are not limited to, the patient’s Commander, first sergeant and Security Forces, as appropriate. Should a Service member high risk patient decline to reschedule an appointment, the member’s Commander will be notified. Commanders of members must be informed when one of their personnel is placed on or removed from the HIL.   F. Continuity of Care.  Regarding Service members, information may be released for purposes of official military processes such as Medical Evaluation Boards or Commander Directed  Evaluations.  In  all  cases  (Service  members,  retirees  and  military  dependents), information may also be shared between military and non-military providers in certain instances in  order  to  facilitate  medical  care  (e.g.,  when  a  patient  is  referred  to  a  civilian  provider  or hospital).   G. Coordination of Care at the Time of Permanent Change of Station (PCS) and Transfer of  Information.  The  care/records  of  any  Service  members  requiring  ongoing  treatment  at  the time  of  PCS  will  be  transferred  to  the  MHC  at  the  gaining  base  for  follow-up  to  ensure continuity of care. This transfer will be discussed with the Service member, but does not require the  Service  member’s  authorization.  However,  every  effort  shall  be  made  to  involve  Service member in the process. In cases of Service members who have terminated treatment, records are reviewed prior to PCS and the hard copy mental health record (if there is a hard copy record) will follow the member along with the dental and medical records. If there are concerns, the Service member  may  be  contacted  by  a  provider  for  a  status  check,  and  the  provider  will  determine  if follow up care will be recommended at the gaining base.  If you are a dependent, your provider will assist in facilitating appropriate transfer of your care to the MTF or a civilian mental health provider and forward your records to the provider assuming your care at the new location.  H. Profiles/Duty Limiting Conditions for Service Members. MHC providers will consult with Commanders  and/or  first  sergeants  any  time  they  feel  a  Service  member  has  a  condition  or circumstance  that  makes  him/her  not  fit  for  duty,  not  deployable  or  requires  any  change  in his/her normal duties.   I.  Drug  or  Alcohol  Abuse  by  Service  Members.  Providers must report  all new diagnoses of substance use disorders and all service members who have entered into or being discharged from a formal outpatient or in patient  substance misuse treatment  program  to  Commanders. Per AFI 44-121, a member may  voluntarily disclose evidence of personal  drug use or possession to  the  58 AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 unit  Commander,  first  sergeant,  substance  abuse  evaluator,  or  a  military  medical  professional. Commanders  will  grant  limited  protection  for  members  who  reveal  this  information  with  the intention of entering treatment. Commanders may not use voluntary disclosure against a member in  an  action  under  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ)  or  when  weighing characterization of service in an administrative separation.   J. Appointment Cancellation and No-Show Policy for All Patients. We ask that you give us at least 24 hours’ notice if you will be unable to make an appointment you have scheduled. We may try to use that appointment for another person seeking assistance from our clinic. If you provide us  with  less  than  24  hours’  notice,  we  will  designate  the  appointment  as  a  “no-show.”  Your provider  may  speak  to  you  about  whether  continuing  treatment  makes  sense  if  you  have  too many  “no-shows.”  If  you  do  not  reschedule  at  the  time  of  cancellation,  a  staff  member  will contact you and offer a follow-up appointment.  K.  Ancillary  Staff/Trainees  Involved  in  Patient  Care.  We  operate  the  MHC  under  a  team concept approach. The team includes mental health technicians or clinician trainees who may be involved in your care. You should address questions about this to your provider.   L.  Exceptional  Family  Member  Program  (EFMP). If  you are a family member of a Service member and you receive care for mental health conditions, your provider must determine if your condition would require enrollment in the EFMP. This may entail disclosure of your condition to proper medical and Command authorities in order to ensure adequate medical care is available at any projected new duty location. Enrollment in the EFMP is mandatory once the special needs of the  family  have  been  identified.  Not  all  mental  health  treatment  will  require  this;  ask  your provider if you have any questions. M. Medication Policy for All Patients. If medication is prescribed for you, it is imperative you plan accordingly. Ideally we ask that you call seven days prior to running out of the medications so as not to disrupt your treatment course. You may request a medication refill if you are actively under  a provider's care and doing well. If not, we ask that you schedule an appointment.   N.  Telephone  Consultations  Policy  for  All  Patients.  Face-to-face  treatment  is  always  the preferred  treatment  modality  but  is  not  always  possible  for  your  needs  or  clinic  availability. Telephone consultations are intended to assist in, not replace, the routine care you receive in our clinic.  We  encourage  you  to  contact  your  provider  in  this  way  any  time  between  scheduled appointments if you have questions or concerns about  your condition or treatment. We ask that you not communicate with your provider by e-mail.   O. Treatment options vary depending on the condition(s) and your preferences.  Treatment options  may  include  various  types  of  therapies  and  medications.    Your  provider  will  discuss treatment  options  with  you  and  together  you  will  create  a  treatment  plan  with  measureable outcomes.  Treatment is voluntary and can be terminated by you at any time, though we request prior to terminating you discuss your plans with the provider.

Before initiating a professional evaluation or treatment relationship with a MH provider, we want you to know about privacy ground rules. Generally, information discussed during the evaluations is  confidential  and  may  not  ordinarily  be  revealed  to  anyone  outside  the  clinic  without  your permission.  Under  some  circumstances,  including  but  not  limited  to  those  listed  below, information  may  be  released  without  your  permission.    One  time  evaluations  do  not  consist  of treatment, but after the evaluation you may be offered a treatment plan or referred elsewhere for treatment.  A. Records of Care for All Patients.  Every clinical visit to MH is documented in the electronic medical  record  and  marked  as  sensitive.    Generally,  only  healthcare  providers  are  allowed  to view  these  sensitive  records,  if  needed.    It  is  important  that  providers  caring  for  you  in  other clinics are aware of the care or evaluation you are receiving here.  If there is a hard copy record, the MH record of Service members will be transferred to the MH clinic at the gaining installation at  the  time  of  Permanent  Change  of  Station  (PCS).  At  the  time  of  retirement  or  separation  of Service members, the MH record will be maintained at the installation MH clinic in accordance with existing records disposition schedules.  For military dependents who are actively involved in treatment at the time of PCS, the provider will discuss the option of transferring care/records.  B.  Disclosure Policy for All Patients.  All medical and mental health records are protected by the  Privacy  Act,  HIPAA  and  other  applicable  laws/regulations.    Most  information  related  to treatment  of  military  dependents  or  retirees  is  not  releasable  without  the  patient’s  written authorization.    Some  of  the  instances  excluded  from  authorization  requirements  are  quality assurance reviews by other mental healthcare providers (MHPs) and collection of information for medical research. There may also be instances where we are required to disclose your record in response  to  a  court  order  or  other  lawful  demand  if  an  exception  to  the  general  rule  of confidentiality  applies.    The  most  common  exceptions  which  may  require  your  mental  health provider  to  disclose  information  to  appropriate  authorities  without  your  authorization  are  as follows: 1.  Child  or  Spouse  Maltreatment.  Providers  must  report  suspected  child  abuse  or  neglect  to military  agencies  and/or  local  child  protective  authorities.  Providers  may  also  be  required  to report other family maltreatment incidents.  2.  Crimes or Fraud. Providers must report any threat to commit crimes or fraud.  3.  Danger  to  Self  or  Others.  Providers  must  take  steps  to  protect  individuals  from  harm  when they  have  reason  to  believe  there  is  a  serious  threat  to  the  life  or  safety  of  the  individual  or others.  4.  Pursuant to a court order or other lawful demand.  5.  Sexual  Assault.    Providers  are  required  to  report  all  sexual  assaults  to  the  Sexual  Assault Response Coordinator (SARC).  C.  Disclosure  Policy  for  Service  members.  In  addition  to  the  disclosure  policies,  above, Command notification by healthcare providers that a Service member has sought and/or is in MH  AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 61 treatment or is taking medication is not necessarily required when an individual voluntarily seeks MH care. However, pursuant to Department of Defense Regulations, healthcare providers must notify your Commander if you meet one of the following criteria:  1. Harm to Self. The provider believes there is a serious risk of self-harm either as a result of  the condition itself or medical treatment of the condition.  2. Harm to Others. The provider believes there is a serious risk of harm to others either as a  result of the condition itself or medical treatment of the condition. This includes any disclosures concerning child abuse or domestic violence consistent with DoD regulations.  3. Harm to Mission. The provider believes there is a serious risk of harm to a specific military operational  mission.  Such  serious  risk  may  include  disorders  that  significantly  impact impulsivity, insight, reliability, and judgment.  4. Special Personnel. The Service member is in the Personnel Reliability Program as described in DoD Instruction 5210.42 or is in a position that has been pre-identified by Service regulation or the  Command  as  having  mission  responsibilities  of  such  potential  sensitivity  or  urgency  that normal notification standards would significantly risk mission accomplishment.  5.  Inpatient  Care.  The  Service  member  is  admitted  or  discharged  from  any  inpatient  mental health or substance abuse treatment facility.  6.  Acute  Medical  Conditions  Interfering  With  Duty.  The  Service  member  is  experiencing  an acute mental health condition or is engaged in an acute medical treatment regimen that impairs the member’s ability to perform assigned duties.  7.  Substance  Abuse  Treatment  Program.  The  Service  member  has  entered  into  or  is  being discharged  from  a  formal  outpatient  or  inpatient  treatment  program  for  the  treatment  of substance abuse or dependence.  8. Command Directed MH Evaluation. The mental health services are obtained as a result of  a command-directed mental health evaluation. 9. Other Special Circumstances. The notification is based on other special circumstances in  which  proper  execution  of  the  military  mission  outweighs  the  interests  served  by  avoiding notification, as determined on a case-by-case basis by a health care provider (or other authorized official of the medical treatment  facility involved) at  the O-6 or equivalent  level  or above or a commanding officer at the O-6 level or above.  In  making  a  disclosure  based  on  the  circumstances  described  in  subparagraphs  1-10  above, healthcare providers shall provide the minimum amount of information to satisfy the purpose of the disclosure.   D. Second Opinion Process  for Service  members:  If you disagree with the recommendations made to your Commander, you can discuss this with your provider, the MTF Patient Advocate, and/or  your  Commander.  Additionally,  if  you  have  a  potentially  disqualifying  condition,  you have the option of seeking a second opinion IAW the provisions of AFI 10-203, Duty Limiting Conditions.   E. Continuity of Care. Regarding Service members, information may be released for purposes of  official  military  processes  such  as  Medical  Evaluation  Boards  or  Commander  Directed Evaluations.  In all cases (Service members,  retirees and military dependents), information  may also  be  shared  between  military  and  non-military  providers  in  certain  instances  in  order  to facilitate medical care (e.g., when a patient is referred to a civilian provider or hospital).    62 AFI44-172  13 NOVEMBER 2015 F.  Special  duty  evaluations:  Evaluations  for  special  duties  or  occupational  classifications  and other evaluations expressly required by applicable DOD issuance or Service regulations are not considered Commander Directed Evaluations.  G. Profiles/Duty Limiting Conditions for Service Members. MHC providers will consult with Commanders  and/or  first  sergeants  any  time  they  feel  a  Service  member  has  a  condition  or circumstance  that  makes  him/her  not  fit  for  duty,  not  deployable  or  requires  any  change  in his/her normal duties.   H.  Drug  or  Alcohol  Abuse  by  Service  Members. Providers must report all new diagnoses of substance use disorders and all service members who have entered into or being discharged from a formal outpatient or in patient  substance misuse treatment  program  to  Commanders. Per AFI 44-121, a member may  voluntarily disclose evidence of personal  drug use or possession to  the unit  Commander,  first  sergeant,  substance  abuse  evaluator,  or  a  military  medical  professional. Commanders  will  grant  limited  protection  for  members  who  reveal  this  information  with  the intention of entering treatment. Commanders may not use voluntary disclosure against a member in  an  action  under  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ)  or  when  weighing characterization of service in an administrative separation.   I.  Ancillary  Staff/Trainees  Involved  in  Patient  Care.  We  operate  the  MHC  under  a  team concept approach. The team includes mental health technicians or clinician trainees who may be involved in your care. You should address questions about this to your provider.
