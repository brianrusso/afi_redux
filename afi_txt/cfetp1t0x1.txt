A thoroughly trained, motivated enlisted workforce is the Air Force's key resource in  meeting challenges  of  the  future.    The  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP)  for  AFSC 1T0X1, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Specialist, provides  management  with the  life-cycle  education/training  framework  and  guidance  necessary  for  planning,  developing, managing,  and  conducting  career  field  education  and  training  programs.    It  provides  a  training guide  for  the  career  field  that  identifies  mandatory  and  optional  skill  level training  received during career progression.    This CFETP identifies  the specific training  individuals receive during each  phase  of  their  career.    This  plan  will  provide  personnel  a  clear  path to success, instill rigor in all aspects of career field training, and train today's workforce for  tomorrow's  jobs.    Ensure  that all  records,  created  as  a  result  of  processes  prescribed  in  this  publication,  are  maintained  in accordance  with  AFMAN  33-363,  Management  of  Records,  and  disposed  of in  accordance with Air  Force  Records  Information  Management  System  (AFRIMS)  Records  Disposition  Schedule (RDS)  located  at  https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-  af61a/afrims/afrims/. 2.  The  CFETP  consists  of  two  parts;  both  parts  of  the  plan  are  used  by  supervisors  to  plan, manage, and control training within the career field: 2.1.  Part  I provides  information necessary for overall management of training in  the career field.  It  contains  administrative  details,  general  information  on  purpose,  use,  and  approval  of  the CFETP, career field progression, skill level training requirements, and resource constraints. 2.2.  Part  II  of  the  CFETP  contains  the  Specialty  Training  Standard  (STS),  Training  Course Index,  and  Command  Unique  Requirements  (replaces  Air  Force  or  Command  Job  Qualification Standards).  MAJCOMs  may  submit  attachments  to  the  CFETP  in  Part  II,  Section  B,  Command Unique  Requirements,  to  accomplish  the  objectives  of  previously  command  written  and disseminated Command Job Qualification Standards (CJQS) or command directed requirements  not fulfilled by the Specialty Training Standard (STS) in Part  II, Section A.  Supervisors and  trainers at  the  unit  level  will  use  Part  II  of  the  CFETP  to  identify,  plan,  and  conduct  unit  level  training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. 3.  Using  guidance  provided  in  the  CFETP  will  ensure  SERE Specialist  receive  effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career.  This plan will enable us to  train  today’s workforce  for  tomorrow’s  jobs.

Identified  requirements  may  be  satisfied  by  OJT,  formal training,  contract  training,  or  exportable  courses.  MAJCOM-developed  training,  to  support  this AFSC, must be identified for inclusion in this plan by  MAJCOM JQS (Job Qualification Standards) and must not duplicate other available training resources. 2.3.  Each  individual  will  complete  the  mandatory  training  requirements  specified  in  this  plan.  The lists of courses, in Part II, will be used as a reference to support training as required. 3.  Coordination  and  Approval.    The  SERE  CFM  is  the  approval  authority.    MAJCOM representatives  and  AETC  training  personnel  will  identify  and  coordinate  on  the  career  field training  requirements.  The  CFETP  will  be  reviewed  annually  by  the  SERE CFM  to  ensure  it  is accurate and current with the Occupational Survey Report (OSR).  Then assess whether the AFS has undergone any mission or role related changes and  if  a  U&TW  is  necessary.  The  review  will  also requirements  of  AFI  33-360  V1,  Publications  and  Forms satisfy  the  annual  certification Management. 4.  Waiver  Authority  for  Mandatory  Requirements.

See  AFI  36-2101,  Classifying  Military Personnel  (Officer  and  Enlisted),  Table 3.3.,  for  specific  procedures  of  processing  requests.  Waiving  any portion  of  an  established  standard  requires  an  in-depth  consideration  on  how  it  will affect the AF mission, the specialty, and the individual: 4.1.  The SERE CFM is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the specialty.  When evaluating waiver  requests the SERE CFM must remember  that  established  mandatory  requirements were justified  and  validated  using  MAJCOM  inputs.  Any waiver request should be compared against predetermined standards to ensure the integrity of the  specialty is maintained.  A review should also consider  the  trainee’s  task  knowledge  and  performance,  capability  in  relation  to  mission requirements,  ability  to  learn  and  transfer  this  knowledge to performance to meet mission needs and future needs within the specialty equal to  peers.

Craftsmen  should  attend  Personnel Recovery Plans and Operations course (PR301) and Nonconventional  Assisted  Recovery  Plans  and  Operations  course (PR 303): This provides SERE Specialist the qualification to operate in a UARCC.  12 6.5.6.  Craftsman should attend the Contingency Wartime Planners Course to better prepare themselves for potential theater operations.   6.6.  Superintendent Level (9): 6.6.1.    To  be  awarded  AFSC  1T091,  an  individual  must  meet  the  requirements  in  AFI  36-2201.  A 9-level is expected to fill one or some of the Key Developmental Positions in accordance with the Enlisted  Development  Team  charter  for  1T0X1.    Additional  training  in  the  areas  of  budget, manpower,  resources,  and  personnel  management  should  be  pursued  through  continuing education.   7.  Training  Decisions.    The  CFETP  uses  a  building  block  approach  (simple  to  complex)  to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the 1T0X1 career field.  The spectrum includes  a  strategy  for  when,  where,  and  how  to  meet  the  training  requirements.  The Specialty Training  Requirements  Team  met  in  March  2015  and  used  the  Occupational  Survey  Report  to generate the requirements for the Training Planning Team (TPT) to use.  The TPT was conducted, in July 2015, to provide suggestions and guidance to the U&TW.  The training decisions reflected in this part of the CFETP are the results of the March 2016 SERE Specialist Career Field U&TW.  The U&TW accepted the following for the 1T0 career field. 7.1.  Changes to STS format: 7.1.1.    Proficiency  code  columns  were  realigned  to  capture  current  and  future  career  field requirements;  the 3-Skill Level  was  adjusted  to  reflect  attainable levels-of-learning.  5-Skill  Level learning levels now reflect instructor duties associated with mandatory assignment to the 336 TRG, 22 TRS Field Training under 48 month stabilized tour for field training qualification through OJT.  Mission Ready Course column was changed to  MRT  to  reflect  operational  mission  requirements.  The intent  of  the  MRT  t asks  is  to  ensure  standardized  S E R E  S p e ci a l i st   training  is accomplished  in the  four  years  in the 22nd TRS and portions of MRT may be outsourced to other DoD units/agencies or approved contractors.  MRT  can  be  done  in  parallel  with  the  5  level tasks.  The purpose is to prepare 1T051s to meet current  and future operational needs of the AF and DoD.  7-Skill Level was adjusted to reflect  management of SERE training, operational support and PR planning management. 7.2.  Initial Skills (Helper) Level (1):  The course has been designated as S-V70-A, SERE Specialist Training Orientation Course (SST-OC).  Although the original intent of SST-OC has not changed, the change in OPCON will give the career field more effective control over the training process. 7.3.  Apprentice Level (3): S-V81-A resistance training objectives were reevaluated to accommodate more than just future instructors view or observation of Level C training.  The use of resistance TTPs in ARL’s and field environments is to help develop and enhance the PR scenario, as well as develop the use of US policy in the SERE candidate.  The goal is to be more proficient through practice of the resistance TTPs and develop instructor skillset and capabilities in the captivity environment.   7.3.1.  A2  Program:  AFS  will  continue  to  use  Modern  Army  Combatives  Program (MACP) certification(s) as a baseline for A2 until the AFI guiding AF Combatives is published with SERE combatives directives. 7.4. Journeyman  Level  (5):  Apprentices  will  attend  AETC  course  S-V81-C,  SERE  Specialist Journeyman Arctic  Survival Training, in a class(es) set aside by AETC/A3ZS specifically for the career field.  13 7.5.  Mission Ready Training (MRT): Changes  in  the  Air  Force  SERE  Program  focusing on fulfilling the  SERE Program triad of Formal Training, SERE Refresher Training (SRT), and SERE operations  has  resulted  in  a  need  to  provide  a  SERE  Specialist  trained  beyond  5-Skill  Level requirements to perform  missions outside the 336 TRG. 7.5.1.  This  focuses  on  operating  stand-alone  programs  and  wartime  requirements.  This  will be accomplished  through  advanced  academics  for  increasing  subject  knowledge  concerning  U.S. policy  for  captivity, mission planning and PRCC operations.  Should include but not limited to: case studies, laboratories and a PRCC exercise. 7.5.2.  Modern  Army  Combatives  Program  Level  2  (MACP-2)  or  equivalent  is  required  for  5-Skill MRT.   7.6.    Craftsman  Level  (7):    AOCIQT  type  training  should  be  incorporated  into  SERE  7-level  for fidelity on PR operations. 8.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).  CCAF accreditation is based on the Criteria for Accreditation of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) Commission of Colleges.  Accreditation held by the CCAF system will apply to a school and its courses that contribute to the CCAF degree. 8.1.  Occupational  Instructor  Certification.  Program  for  qualified  instructors  who  teach  CCAF collegiate-level  courses  at  CCAF  affiliated  schools  (S-V81-A,  SERE  Specialist  Training Apprentice Course).  The  purpose of the certification is to recognize instructors’ extensive faculty development  training,  education,  and  qualifications  required  to  teach  accredited  CCAF  course(s) and  formally  acknowledge  instructors’  practical  teaching  experience.  Qualified  officer,  enlisted, civilian and  other  service  instructors  are  eligible  for  this  certification.  To  qualify  the  instructor must  be  assigned to course S-V81-A and meet requirements identified on the  Community College of the Air Force website: www.au.af.mil/au/ccaf/. 8.2.

This  section identifies  known resource  constraints,  which  preclude optimal/desired training  from  being  developed  or  conducted,  including  time,  manpower,  experience,  and  cost.  A narrative  explanation  of  each  resource  constraint  and  an  impact  statement  describing  what  effect each  constraint  has  on  training  are  included.  Also,  included  in  this  section  are  actions  required, office  of  primary  responsibility,  and  target  completion  date.  Resource  constraints  will  be,  as  a minimum, reviewed and updated annually. 11.1.  Constraints: 11.1.1.  Annual billets are requested from Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA) for the following courses:  SERE 350, SERE 360, SERE 370-A/B, PR 296/297, PR 292, PR 301 and PR 303.  Due to constraints, JPRA is currently unable to meet all of these AFS upgrade requirements for some of the requested  courses.    Non-availability  of  seats  within  these  courses  can  result  in  delays  in  upgrade training  and  inability  to  meet  MAJCOM  operational  requirements.    SERE  CFM  will  continue  to request  training  allocations.    Resource  and  manpower  constraint  impact  the  336  TRG’s  ability  to execute equivalent courses. 11.1.2.  80 funded training billets were requested per year for course L9AQA1XXXX-0A1A.  This identifier was incorrect  and  has  been  changed  to  L9ABA1T031 0A7A,  US  Army Basic  Airborne  19 Course, through AETC/A3ZS  and  approved through  AETC/A2/3.  Awaiting  administrative action to confer authorized training billets. 11.1.3. The CWPC and JAOPC has capacity to support the SERE career field.  However, the SERE CFM and MAJCOM FAMs will need to identify need to AF and MAJCOM TRQI managers to secure seats for the career field. 11.1.4.   Implementation  of  STS  line  items  in  this  document  requires significant  changes  to  the 3-Level  training  course, 5 level OJT, MRT and a  complete  rewrite  of  the  SERE  7-Level  course.  336 TRSS/DOT and the 22nd TRS cannot meet the 120-day suspense, directed AF guidance, based on  current manning.  Until all manpower issues are resolved, the 336 TRG will establish courseware and OJTproject priorities by collaborating with HQ AETC and meet the requirements of this CFETP when able and report quarterly to AF/A3XX until met. 11.1.5.  Implementation  of  STS  line  1.4.2.    Lack  of  training  capacity  prevents  military  free  fall qualification  for  every  SERE  Specialist.    This  constrains  SERE  Specialist  upgrade  to  the  BA-22 emergency  parachute  system,  necessitating  a  Static  Line  Deployed  Emergency  Parachute  system capability.    The  SERE  career  field  requires  the  AF  to  test  and  approve  a  system  to  meet  SERE specialist upgrade and experiential training in Emergency Egress TTP. 11.1.6.  Meeting AOCIQT type training for course S-V81-F will require utilizing a facility with AOC like assets. This will require a MOA or another type of formal agreement to accomplish.   11.1.7. of the AF Combatives Program AFI.  The A2 program will transition from Army MACP to Air Force oversight upon publication PART II Implementation.  This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for classes 1. starting NLT 120 days after signature/approval. 2.  Purpose.   As  prescribed  in  AFI  36-2201  Air  Force  Training  Program  on  the  Job  Training Administration, this STS: 2.1.

Column―3B identifies the levels-of-learning derived from the task analysis and the TLO for that corresponding task or knowledge.  Use the PCK to determine the definition of that code.  These tasks identified are required to meet 5 Skill Level upgrade requirements and  award  of  the 1T051.  Line  items  will  be  accomplished  while  assigned  to  22  TRS under stabilized tour through OJT  or formal courses identified as upgrade requirements by the AFECD. 2.2.3.  Column―3C  identifies the levels-of-learning derived from the task analysis and the TLO  20 for  that  corresponding  task  or  knowledge.    Use  the  PCK  to  determine  the  definition  of  that  code.  These tasks or knowledge are derived from the AF SRT and operations support requirements of the 1T051.  AD personnel will complete MRT during the 48 month Stabilized Tour and required prior to deployment  or  PCS/PCA  from  the  336  TRG.    The  ANG  and  AFRC  FAM  will  identify  MRT  T requirement via MAJCOM MTL.   2.2.4.  Column―3D  identifies the levels-of-learning derived from the task analysis and the TLO for  that  corresponding  task  or  knowledge.    Use  the  PCK  to  determine  the  definition  of  that  code.  These tasks and knowledge are required for graduation from S-V81-F, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Craftsman Course.(7-Skill Level) 2.3.  Required  training  levels.  SERE  Specialist  personnel  are  trained  in  unit  OJT  and  formal courses  for  skill  level  upgrade.  Circle  current  duty  position  task  number.  If  in  upgrade  training, all  duty position  requirements,  to  include  tasks  commensurate  with  the  skill  level  in  training  for, will be identified.  After  an individual has completed upgrade training and has received  their new skill level, only the tasks  that are specific to  their  duty position will be required to be maintained and  identified.  All  remaining  task  numbers  that  are  circled  and  are  no  longer  required  for  an individual’s  duty  position,  will  have  the  circles  erased.  Personnel  that  are  not  trained  to  the appropriate skills task levels, or who fail to maintain standards, or who are downgraded should  be entered into remedial training.  Unit commanders should review records and pertinent  information on personnel who fail to maintain standards after remedial training for removal from  the career field.  Requests  for  waivers  to  a  skill  training  level  are  discouraged,  but  are  coordinated through  the MAJCOM  SERE  FAM for  approval  recommendation  or  final  disapproval.  Waiver  requests with an approval recommendation are forwarded to the SERE CFM for a final decision. 2.4.  OJT  certification  columns.    Column  2  provides  OJT  certification  columns  to  record completion of task and knowledge training requirements.  Certification is accomplished as  outlined in AFI 36-2201. 2.5.

For  OJT,  the tasks  in  column  2B  are  trained  and  qualified  to  the  identified  level-of-learning  and  means  the individual  can  perform the  task  and  meets  local  requirements  for  accuracy,  timeliness,  and correct use of procedures for the listed skill task and/or knowledge level. 2.6.  Weighted  Airman  Promotion  System  (WAPS)  and  Specialty  Knowledge  Test  (SKT).  The CFETP is also a guide for development of promotion tests used in the WAPS.  Specialty  Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron by  Senior  NCOs, with  extensive  practical  experience  in  their  career  fields  based  on  STS  subject  matter  areas.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog.  Individual  responsibilities are in  Chapter 1,  paragraph  1.19  of  AFI 36-2605,  Air  Force Personnel Testing  System. 2.7.  Upgrade  Certification  Procedures.  Prior  to  upgrade,  all  1T0X1  personnel,  regardless  of duty  position,  must  satisfactorily  complete  1T0X1  Career  Knowledge  training  commensurate with  upgrade  skill level.  Trainees  must  also meet  AFSC  experience  requirements  outlined  in  Air Force  Enlisted  Classification  Directory  (AFECD)  and  be  task  certified  on  5-Level  or  7-level tasks.  Work center supervisors may not defer selected tasks without SERE FAM approval and AF SERE CFM  waiver to training policy.  Deferment actions will be coordinated with the unit training office,  SERE FAM,  and  AF SERE CFM.  Work  centers  may  add  local  upgrade  mandatory  and non-mandatory tasks.  Continue  to accomplish completion  of non-mandatory  tasks  pertinent to the  21 units, as tasks  become available for training. 2.8.  Post-Graduate  Evaluation.  Following  completion  of  course  S-V81-A,  all  graduates  and their supervisors  must  accomplish  the  written  "Post-Graduate  Evaluation"  within  a 90  to  150 day window.  336 TRSS/DOT will provide the post-graduate evaluations to supervisors and  graduates.  Results  of  the  graduate  evaluation  wi l l  be  forwarded  to  HQ  USAF/A3XX  and  HQ AETC/A3ZS within a 180 to 225 day window following course completion. 3.  Records Documentation. Identification.    Enter  trainee's  and  supervisor’s/trainer’s  identification  data  on  the  JQS 3.1. identification page.    3.2.  Certification.  Certify tasks as follows ensuring all annotations are in pencil: 3.2.1.  Circle  current  duty  position  task  number.    If  in  upgrade  training,  all  duty  position requirements, to include tasks commensurate with the skill level in training for, will be  identified.  After  an  individual  has  completed  upgrade  training  and  has  received  their  new  skill  level, only the  tasks  that  are  specific  to  their  duty  position  will  be  required  to  be  maintained  and  identified.  All  remaining  task  numbers  that  are  circled  and  are  no  longer  required  for  an  individuals’  duty position will have the circles erased. 3.2.2.  As task training starts, enter the training start date in column ―2A. 3.2.3. be completed on the entire task, circle the noun or verb that applies. If a task is listed as remove/install or has more than one noun or verb, and training cannot 3.2.4.  When  the  trainee  and  trainer  agree  to  task  proficiency,  the  trainee  will  initial  the  trainee block (column ―2C).  The trainer will enter completion date in column ―2B and will initial in  the trainer block (column ―2D). 3.3.  Decertification.  To  decertify  an  individual,  who  is  no  longer  proficient  at  a  required  task, "X"  out  the  "completion  date"  block  and  erase  the  start  date,  trainer,  certifier  and  trainee's initials.  Annotate  AF  IMT  623A,  On-The-Job Training  Record  Continuation  Sheet,  to  reflect  the reason for decertification. 3.4.  Recertification.    Once  retraining  is  started,  enter  the  new  training  start  date.    After completing the task to a "go" level, recertify following procedures in paragraph 3.2. 3.5.  Transcribing  CFETPs.  Transcribing  documentation  to  a  new  CFETP  is  an  administrative function, not a re-evaluation of training.  For tasks previously certified and required in the current duty  position,  circle  the  subparagraph  number  next  to  the  task  statement  and  enter  the  current date in the completion column.  Trainee initials in the trainee column and the current task certifier  or supervisor/trainer  initials  in  the  trainer  column.    Remember,  during  the  transcription  process  no training is  taking place;  therefore,  the  trainer’s  initial  are not  required  when  transcribing previous certification  for  tasks  not  required  in  the  current  duty  position,  carry  forward  only  the  previous completion date of  certification (not the initials of  another person).  If  and when transcribed tasks become  duty  position  requirements,  recertify  using  standard  certification  procedures.  The  person whose initials appear in the trainer or certifier block, during the transcription process, must meet  the requirements of their respective roles.  Upon completion of the transcription process, give the  old CFETP to the member. 3.6.  Third Party Certification.  There are no designated core tasks identified in this CFETP because  22 all tasks are completed and evaluated through formal courses conducted at the 336 TRG, Fairchild AFB, and/or OJT under the stabilized tour in the 22nd TRS.  Therefore, no requirement for third-party certification in Column 2E. 4.  Proficiency  Code  Key (PCK).  The  table,  on  page  2 3 ,  contains  the  PCK  used  to  determine a code, that designates the level-of-learning required for a specific task or knowledge achieved in formal training and/or OJT. 5.

Guidance  from  HQ  USAF/DPPE  during  development  of  the  1T0X1  CFETP  precludes  the use  of  MAJCOM  directed  Job  Qualification  Standards  (JQS)  or  Command  Job  Qualification Standards (CJQS).  The  purpose of the CFETP is  to  provide one  "cradle  to  grave" document to manage  training  of  personnel  in  the  SERE  Specialist  career  field.    However,  recognizing MAJCOMs  may  have  command  unique  training  requirements;  MAJCOMs  may  identify command unique requirements or attachments to this section.  The requirements or attachments in this  section  of  the  CFETP  accomplish  the  objectives  of  any  previous  command  written  and disseminated CJQS.  They will also ensure proper training of their personnel to meet command or mission requirements not fulfilled by the Specialty Training Standard (STS) in Part II, Section A. 2.  MAJCOMs will review command unique training requirements during the annual CFETP review and submit any desired changes to the SERE Career Field Manager for review and approval.  If an STS supplemental attachment is required, MAJCOMs will list requirements over and above  the STS requirements listed in Part II, Section A, in STS format. 44   Section F – Technical References  NOTE 1: Technical References (TR) are listed in Section F.  The individual objectives in this STS may use one or more TR’s for Courseware Development and/or OJT.  The number assigned to the TR in Section F will be referenced to each task in the SERE CFETP Master Enabling Learning Objective (ELO) document.    NOTE 2: The SERE CFETP Master ELO document is maintained on the SERE CFM library on the GA SharePoint site.    NOTE 3: Request to add a new TR can be approved by HAF/A3XX/SERE CFM upon request.  In a case where a TR is updated, revised, replaced or rescinded HAF/A3XX makes a determination in regards to the use of that TR.  It will be updated on the Master ELO document and published.  AFR references remain usable and listed where an AFI reference could not be found.
