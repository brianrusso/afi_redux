Exceptions:  Evaluatee  failure  during  the qualification  phase,  evaluatee  completion  of  the  qualification  phase,  or  SUAS-E  currency requirements. 14 AFI11-502V2  19 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 5 SUAS EVALUATIONS 5.1.  General.  The  SUAS  Stan/Eval  Program  utilizes  qualification  evaluations  to  ensure qualification  of  SUAS-Os  and  supplementary  evaluations  to  ensure  standardization  of operations. SUAS-O qualification evaluations are administered periodically and documented on AF Form 8, Certification of Aircrew Qualification IAW Chapter 7. 5.2.  Categories.  Qualification  evaluations  are  divided following  categories: Qualification  (QUAL),  Mission  (MSN),  Instructor  (INSTR)  and  SPOT  each  consisting  of  two structured phases, ground and flight. Each phase requires the completion of requisite tasks.     (T-2). into the 5.2.1.  QUAL Evaluations.  Ensure basic qualification in the SUAS and/or crew position. All SUAS-Os  shall  complete  a  periodic  QUAL  evaluation  in  their  assigned  SUAS,  to  include requisites,  as  specified  in  the  applicable  AFI  11-5MDS,  Volume  2.  (T-2).    Exception: AFMC  flight  test  and  USAFA  research  operations  –  see  AFI  11-5FT,  Volume  2  for evaluation criteria. 5.2.2.  MSN Evaluations.  All SUAS-Os maintaining MR or Basic Mission Capable (BMC) status  shall  complete  a  periodic  MSN  evaluation  that  includes  evaluation  in  their  assigned SUAS, to  include requisites, as specified in  the applicable AFI 11-5MDS, Volume 2 (T-2).  The MSN portion should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required in the performance of  normal  operational  and  training  sorties.  The  requirement  for  a  MSN  portion  may  be waived  for  those  SUAS  where  performance  of  normal  operational,  test  and  training  sorties involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of a basic QUAL evaluation as specified in AFI 11-5MDS, Volume 2. 5.2.3.  INSTR  Evaluations.    Qualify  SUAS-Os  as  instructors  in  their  assigned  SUAS  by focusing  primarily  on  the  examinee’s  instructional  ability.  SUAS-Os  obtaining  or maintaining instructor qualification in a particular SUAS shall complete initial and periodic evaluations  of  instructional  ability  in  that  SUAS  (T-2).  Instructors  are  evaluated  to  the standards  contained in AFI 11-5MDS,  Volume 2.  (T-2).  Exception:  AFMC flight  test  and USAFA research operations – see AFI 11-5FT, Volume 2 for evaluation criteria. 5.2.3.1.  To  initially  qualify  as  an  instructor  in  a  particular  SUAS,  the  member  shall successfully  complete  an  initial  instructor  (INIT  INSTR)  evaluation.  (T-2).    Candidate SUAS-I  shall  be  qualified  in  all  areas/sub-areas  they  shall  instruct  and  are  expected  to meet  the  standards  outlined  in  AFI  11-5MDS,  Volume  2.  (T-2).    Instructor  candidates shall  be  evaluated  on  instructor  performance  during  a  representative  sample  of maneuvers. (T-2).  Instructors should have a solid understanding of systems, procedures, and  techniques.  Accomplish  INIT  INSTR  evaluations  on  actual  instructional  missions whenever  possible.    When  students  are  not  available  or  mission  requirements/crew composition requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or, as a last resort,  the  evaluator  may  serve  as  the  student  for  the  purpose  of  evaluating  the examinee’s instructional ability. (T-2). 5.2.3.2.  Periodic  evaluation  of  instructional  ability  shall  be  conducted  during  all subsequent periodic evaluations. (T-2). AFI11-502V2  19 AUGUST 2015 15 5.2.3.3.  If  instructor  qualification  is  lost  in  a  SUAS  it  may  be  regained  through  an instructor requalification evaluation  IAW  Paragraph 5.2.5.2.6 or as directed in the AFI 11-5MDS, Volume 1. 5.2.3.4.  QUAL,  MSN  and  INSTRUCTOR  evaluations  may  be  combined  whenever possible. 5.2.4.  SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional).  A SPOT evaluation is used evaluate a specific event or requirement and is not intended to satisfy the requirements of a periodic evaluation  (e.g., QUAL/MSN or  INSTR).   SPOT evaluations have no specific  requisites or requirements,  unless  specified  in  MAJCOM  supplements.    An  evaluation  that  begins  as  a SPOT evaluation  may become  (and be documented as)  a required periodic evaluation  if all required  flight  phase  requirements  are  completed  during  the  SPOT  evaluation  and  the examinee  subsequently  completes  all  ground  phase  requirements  for  the  evaluation  within the periods described in Paragraph 5.5.3.  Do not add on missions (flights) to complete the requirements  for  a  periodic  evaluation  unless  the  group/unit  commander  concurs  with  the SUAS-O’s desire to realign the evaluation expiration date and approves the additional flight time  requirements.  (T-3).    Evaluations  not  listed  in  Paragraphs    5.2.1-  5.2.3  shall  be documented  as  SPOT  evaluations  (T-2).    Note:  When  the  SUAS-E  administering  a  SPOT evaluation  is  not  qualified  in  the  same  SUAS  and  same  crew  position  of  the  examinee,  the evaluation shall not be credited towards a periodic evaluation. 5.2.5.  Qualification  Evaluation  Prefixes.    The  following  prefixes  shall  be  used,  when applicable, to further describe the evaluations listed in Paragraphs  5.2.1-  5.2.3 (T-2). 5.2.5.1.  Initial (INIT).  The first evaluation of any type for a crew position or instructor qualification in an SUAS type (e.g., INIT QUAL, INIT MSN, INIT INSTR). 5.2.5.2.  Requalification    (RQ).    An  evaluation  administered  to  remedy  a  loss  of qualification  due  to  expiration  of  a  required  periodic  evaluation,  loss  of  currency exceeding six months (as specified in the applicable AFI 11-5MDS, Volume 1), a flight recheck  following  a  failed  periodic  evaluation,  or  loss  of  qualification  due  to  a commander-directed downgrade. 5.2.5.2.1.  Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The evaluation shall be IAW the guidance for that periodic evaluation. (T-2).  The AF Form 8 description shall be documented with an RQ prefix. 5.2.5.2.2.  When loss of qualification is due to loss of currency, the evaluation profile shall  be  as  directed  by  the  unit  commander  and  shall  include,  as  a  minimum,  those items for which the individual is non-current. (T-3).  The AF Form 8 description shall be documented with RQ SPOT. (T-2). 5.2.5.2.3.  When  loss  of  qualification  is  for  failure  to  pass  a  flight  evaluation,  the recheck  evaluation  shall  be  IAW  the  provisions  of  Paragraph  5.6.1    The  flight evaluation form description shall be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT, as applicable. (T-2). 5.2.5.2.4.  When loss of qualification is due to a commander-directed downgrade (see Paragraph 7.4), the evaluation profile shall be as directed by the commander. (T-3).  16 AFI11-502V2  19 AUGUST 2015 The AF Form 8 description shall be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT, as applicable. (T-2). 5.2.5.2.5.  Do not use RQ to prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation.  No qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible. (T-2). 5.2.5.2.6.  When requalification deals with instructor capability, the flight evaluation form description shall be documented with RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT). (T-2). 5.2.5.3.  No-Notice (N/N).  A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of  the  evaluation  at  or  after  the  beginning  of  normal  preparation  for  the  mission.  “Normal  preparation”  shall  be  defined  in  the  MAJCOM/unit  supplement.  (T-2).  The intent is to preclude extraordinary preparation for the mission. 5.2.5.3.1.  The  no-notice  evaluation  program  provides  commanders  a  sampling  of daily SUAS-O performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness. 5.2.5.3.2.  An  examinee  may  utilize  a  no-notice  evaluation  to  update  a  QUAL/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the evaluation are completed within the periods described in Paragraph 5.5.3 (T-2). 5.2.5.4.  Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted in a  simulator  as  specified  in  AFI  11-5MDS,  Volume  2.    A  SIM  evaluation  shall  include system set-up, completion of checklist items up to launch, and tear down. (T-2). 5.2.5.5.  Multiple Prefixes.  More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation (e.g.,  N/N  SIM  SPOT).    The  applicability  of  any  prefixes  to  portions  of  any  combined evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes shall be explained under description on the AF Form 8. (T2). 5.3.  Grading System.  A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and document SUAS-O performance.  On one level, individual scores are recorded for examinations and areas/subareas of  SUAS-O  performance  are  individually  graded  against  established  evaluation  criteria.  Performance less than fully qualified shall be documented. (T-2).  On the second level, an overall qualification level is determined from the compilation of these individual scores/grades. 5.3.1.  Area/Subarea Grades. 5.3.1.1.  AFI 11-5MDS, Volume 2 establishes areas and subareas to be evaluated during emergency procedure and other evaluations to include the appropriate grading criteria for those areas/subareas. Areas/subareas shall have a two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U) grading system.  Discrepancies shall be documented against the listed subareas. (T2). 5.3.1.1.1.  Q  is  the  desired  level  of  performance.    The  examinee  demonstrated  a satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed SUAS-O duties within the prescribed tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission. 5.3.1.1.2.  Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the SUAS-E or there  were  minor  deviations  from  established  standards  that  did  not  jeopardize mission accomplishment or flight safety. 5.3.1.1.3.  U  indicates  a  breach  of  flight  discipline,  performance  outside  allowable parameters  or  deviations  from  prescribed  procedures/tolerances  that  adversely AFI11-502V2  19 AUGUST 2015 17 affected  mission  accomplishment  or  compromised  flight  safety.    An  examinee receiving an area/subarea grade of U normally requires additional training.  When, in the  judgment  of  the  SUAS-E,  additional  training  will  not  constructively  improve examinee’s performance, it is not required. In this case, the SUAS-E shall thoroughly debrief the examinee. (T-2). 5.3.1.2.  Remedial  Action.    All  grades  of  Q-  or  less  require  action  to  remedy  the discrepancy  and/or  deficiency  in  performance.    Remedial  action  includes  debriefing discrepancies  and/or  assignment  of  additional  training.    See  Paragraph  5.6  when discrepancies result in failure to pass a flight evaluation. 5.3.1.2.1.  Debriefed  Discrepancy.    Remedial  action  accomplished  during  debrief  of the  evaluation  wherein  the  SUAS-E  provides  briefing/instruction  concerning  the discrepancy  and  determines  the  examinee  has  gained  the  necessary  knowledge  or proficiency  to  remedy  the  discrepancy.    The  discrepancy  area/subarea  description  is annotated with “   Debriefed” in the Remarks section of the AF Form 8. 5.3.1.2.2.  Additional Training.  Any training recommended by a SUAS-E to remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation. 5.3.1.2.2.1.  Additional training may include self-study, ground instruction, use of a  simulator,  or  flight  instruction.    To  complete  additional  training,  the  examinee shall demonstrate attainment of satisfactory knowledge or proficiency. (T-2). 5.3.1.2.2.2.  Additional  training  is  documented  in  Item(s)  Requiring  Additional Training  on  the  AF  Form  8.    Description  of  assigned  additional  training  shall include  how  satisfactory  knowledge  or  proficiency  will  be  demonstrated  to  an evaluator or instructor. (T-2). 5.3.1.2.2.3.  Due  dates  and  dates  on  which  additional  training  is  completed  shall be documented in the appropriate areas of the AF Form 8. (T-2). 5.3.1.2.2.4.  The  evaluator  or  instructor  who  completed  the  additional  training shall  sign  and  date  verifying  completion  of  all  assigned  training  on  the  flight evaluation form in Item(s)  Requiring Additional Training. (T-2). 5.3.1.2.2.5.  Commanders  shall  ensure  required  additional  training  is  completed. (T-2). Accomplish additional training by the last day of the third month following the  date  of  the  discrepancy,  e.g.,  for  an  evaluation  on  21  Jan  13,  additional training shall be accomplished by 30  Apr 13.  (T-2).   If  an SUAS-O  exceeds the allotted  time  for  completion  of  additional  training,  the  unit  commander  shall review  the  situation  and  direct  appropriate  action.    (T3).    Document  the circumstances  with  a  Memorandum  for  Record  (MFR)  placed  in  the  FEF  of  the affected individual. (T-2).  Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected AF Form 8 under Remarks when action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. (T-2).  MFRs become a permanent part of the FEF only when the  major  discrepancy  addressed  by  the  MFR  is  not  addressed  or  corrected  by  a later AF Form 8. 5.3.1.3.  The  SUAS-E  shall  grade  the  areas/subareas  listed  as  ”required”  in  the  general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-5MDS, Volume 2. (T-2). 18 AFI11-502V2  19 AUGUST 2015 5.3.1.4.  The  SUAS-E  shall  grade  any  area/subarea  observed  during  an  evaluation  if performance  in  that  area/subarea  impacts  the  specific  evaluation  accomplished  or  flight safety. (T-2). 5.3.1.5.  Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions. 5.3.1.6.  Minor  momentary  deviations  from  grading  criteria  tolerances  are  acceptable, provided  the  examinee  applies  prompt  corrective  action  and  such  deviations  do  not jeopardize  flight  safety.  Consider  cumulative  deviations  when  determining  the  overall area/subarea grade. 5.3.1.7.  The SUAS-E may further identify an area/sub-area as “Commendable” if, in the SUAS-E’s determination, the SUAS-O has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in that particular area/sub-area.  Document commendable areas in the examiner’s remarks section of the AF Form 8. 5.3.2.  Qualification  Levels.    EPEs  and  overall  evaluation  performance  are  graded  by qualification levels as follows: 5.3.2.1.  Qualification  Level  1  (Q-1).    The  SUAS-O  demonstrated  desired  performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the grading  criteria.  This  shall be awarded when no  discrepancies were noted, and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if: 5.3.2.1.1.  The  discrepancies  resulted area(s)/subarea(s). in  no  U  grades  being  given in  any 5.3.2.1.2.  In  the  judgment  of  the  SUAS-E,  none  of  the  discrepancies  preclude awarding of an overall Qualification Level 1. 5.3.2.1.3.  All  discrepancies  noted  during  the  evaluation  were  cleared  during  the debriefing of that evaluation. 5.3.2.2.  Qualification  Level  2  (Q-2).  The  SUAS-O  demonstrated  the  ability  to  perform duties safely, but: 5.3.2.2.1.  There  were  one  or  more  area(s)/subarea(s)  where  additional  training  was assigned. 5.3.2.2.2.  A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded. 5.3.2.2.3.  In the judgment of the SUAS-E, there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/subareas. 5.3.2.3.  Qualification Level 3 (Q-3).  The SUAS-O demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety, performance, or knowledge. 5.3.2.3.1.  An  area  grade  of  U  awarded  in  a  critical  area  requires  an  overall  Q-3  for the  evaluation.    Note:  Airmanship,  Flight  Discipline,  and  Safety  are  considered critical  areas  for  all  SUAS-Os.    Additionally,  all  emergency  procedures  are considered  critical.  If  one  critical  area  is  graded  U,  then  the  overall  grade  for  the evaluation shall be Q-3. 5.3.2.3.2.  An overall Q-3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the SUAS-E, there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/subareas. AFI11-502V2  19 AUGUST 2015 19 5.3.2.4.  Overall Qualification Levels. 5.3.2.4.1.  The  overall  qualification  level  awarded  on  an  evaluation  is  based  on performance during both the flight and ground phases. An overall grade of Q-1 or Q-2  shall  be  awarded  only  after  all  evaluation  requirements  have  been  completed  and given due consideration. (T-2).  An overall grade of Q-3 may be awarded at any time. 5.3.2.4.2.  To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the SUAS-O shall satisfy the criteria set forth in the applicable AFI 11-5 MDS, Volume 2 and demonstrate ability to operate the SUAS and/or equipment safely and effectively during all phases of an evaluation. (T-2). 5.3.2.4.3.  Overall  qualification  grades  shall  be  a  cumulative  process.    While  AFI 115MDS, Volume 2 guidance may dictate the highest grade for a flight or EPE based on area and subarea performance, SUAS-E judgment shall always be the determining factor  in  deciding  the  overall  qualification  level.  (T-2).  The  SUAS-E  shall  consider performance on requisite examinations in assigning the overall qualification level. (T-2). 5.3.2.5.  Exceptionally  Qualified  Designation.    An  exceptionally  qualified  designation may  be  awarded  by  the  SUAS-E.    The  designation  can  only  be  applied  to  the  total evaluation - not to separate requisites.  The designation may be awarded when: 5.3.2.5.1.  The  SUAS-O  has  demonstrated  exceptional  skill  and  knowledge  in  all phases of the evaluation; 5.3.2.5.2.  The SUAS-O has not failed any requisite and; 5.3.2.5.3.  The  SUAS-O  received  a  qualified  grade  with  no  remedial  action  on  all areas/subareas evaluated during emergency procedures and flight evaluations. 5.4.  Evaluation  Criteria.  AFSOC/A3,  in  coordination  with  using  commands,  shall  establish and maintain standardized QUAL, MSN, and  INSTR  evaluation  criteria in the appropriate AFI 11-5MDS,  Volume  2.    AFSOC/A3V  shall  establish  critical  evaluation  areas  that,  upon  failure, would adversely affect the qualification of a SUAS-O.  Critical areas include, but are not limited to, Airmanship, Flight Discipline, Safety, and all emergency procedures.  Grade all critical areas as either Qualified (Q) or Unqualified (U). (T-2).  Additional critical areas may be established in AFI 11-5MDS, Volume 2. 5.5.  Requisites.  These include both ground and flight phase items. 5.5.1.  Ground Phase Requisites. 5.5.1.1.  The  ground  phase  for  periodic  SUAS-O  evaluations  includes  requisites  listed below.  See Chapter 6 for additional guidance on SUAS-O examinations. 5.5.1.1.1.  QUAL  Evaluations.    Written  closed  book  examination,  Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable), and as specified in AFI 11-5MDS, Volume 2. 5.5.1.1.2.  Scheduled  periodic  evaluations  shall  only  be  accomplished  after  written examinations are completed. (T-2). 5.5.1.2.  Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). 20 AFI11-502V2  19 AUGUST 2015 5.5.1.2.1.  Scope.    Evaluate  a  SUAS-O’s  knowledge  of  MDS-specific  emergency procedures  and  systems  knowledge  for  all  QUAL  evaluations;  evaluate  mission specific emergency procedures (if applicable) during MSN evaluations. (T-2). 5.5.1.2.2.  Content  and  Administration.    AFI  115MDS,  Volume  2  shall  specify contents  of  EPEs,  grading  areas  to  be  evaluated,  grading  criteria  and  whether  EPEs may be done during flight, in a simulator, or verbally. 5.5.1.2.2.1.  A  single  EPE  may  be  used  for  separate  evaluations  (e.g.,  a QUAL/MSN and INSTR evaluation). 5.5.1.2.2.2.  The combined EPE shall be of a scope and duration to cover required areas and shall be within the requisite zone for each evaluation. (T-2). 5.5.1.2.3.  Grading.    Satisfactory  performance  for  EPEs  requires  taking  the  proper action in the correct sequence, not a verbatim response.  Each SUAS-O is responsible for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their SUAS position. (T-2). 5.5.1.2.4.  Additional Training.  For an EPE requiring additional training, the SUAS-E  shall  indicate  if  the  additional  training  shall  be  accomplished  before  next  flight under restrictions in the Remarks block of the flight evaluation form. (T-2). 5.5.1.2.5.  Boldface/CAPs  Failure.    An  incorrect  response  to  a  Boldface/CAP situation  during  an  EPE  requires  an  unqualified  (3)  EPE  grade.  (T-2).    A  SUAS-O who receives a 3 grade as a result of Boldface/CAPs error shall not fly again until a successful reevaluation is accomplished.  (T2). 5.5.1.2.6.  Unqualified    EPE.    An  examinee  receiving  an  unqualified  EPE  grade  (3) shall be placed on supervised status  until  a successful reevaluation  is  accomplished. (T-2). 5.5.2.  Flight Phase Requisites.  The flight phase for evaluations include execution in either the SUAS type or a suitable simulator profile that allows evaluation of SUAS-O performance as specified in  AFI 11-5MDS, Volume 2.  Evaluation  profiles shall be realistic, reflect  unit tasking,  and  incorporate  current  tactics  applicable  to  the  unit  mission.  (T-2).    Profiles  shall include  mission  planning,  execution,  and  debrief.  (T-3).    If  the  assigned  system  is  a  multi-person operation, then the SUAS-O shall perform the mission in all qualified positions. (T-3).  HQ  AFSOC/A3T  determines  the  approval  criteria  for  simulators  and  other  SUAS  crew training devices. 5.5.3.  Requisite Completion.  One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of  combined  evaluations  as  defined  in  AFI  11-5MDS,  Volume  2.    Requisites  from  a completed    evaluation  may  be  used  for  subsequent  evaluations  provided  they  cover  all required  areas  and  are  within  the  requisite  zone  for  each  evaluation.    For  all  evaluations, accomplish requisites as follows: 5.5.3.1.  In-the-Eligibility Period.  For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in the eligibility period, all requisites shall be completed within the six-month eligibility period prior to the expiration date of the current evaluation period to update that expiration date. (T-2). 5.5.3.2.  Out-of-the-Eligibility  Period.    For  periodic  evaluations  outside  the  eligibility period,  all  requisites  shall  be  completed  within  a  six-month  period  beginning  with  the AFI11-502V2  19 AUGUST 2015 21 month  in  which  the  first  ground  requisite  was  administered.    Exception:  For  extended evaluations,  requisites  may  be  completed  between  the  beginning  of  the  six-month eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date. 5.5.3.3.  Requisites valid for a failed evaluation per Paragraph 5.5.3.1 or  5.5.3.2 remain valid, see Paragraph 5.6.1 5.5.3.4.  Requisite  completion  dates  from  the  Q-3  AF  Form  8  shall  not  be  annotated  on the recheck AF Form 8. (T-2).  The recheck AF Form 8 shall only include documentation of the flight phase evaluation. (T-2). 5.6.  Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. 5.6.1.  Recheck.  If a SUAS-O fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or ground recheck shall be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first failure, e.g. for an evaluation  on  20  Jun  14,  complete  the  recheck  by  30  Sep  14.  (T-3).    A  recheck  is successfully  completed  when  the  SUAS-O  performs  to  Q  criteria  (Q  or  Q-/debriefed)  for each area graded U. Group/CCs may approve waivers to the time limits in this paragraph on a  case-by-case  basis.    Document  such  action  with  an  MFR  placed  in  the  FEF.  (T-2).  Incorporate  the  information  contained  in  the  MFR  onto  the  affected  AF  Form  8  under Remarks  when  action  is  complete,  and  remove  the  MFR  from  the  FEF.  (T-2).    Memos  for record become a permanent part of the FEF only when the major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later AF Form 8.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to requalify the individual. (T-2).  Commanders shall determine the number of flights to  be  allowed  during  this  period,  based  on  the  individual’s  experience  level,  present qualifications  and  hours  of  training  required.

Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period.  If a SUAS-O fails to complete  an  evaluation  (either  ground  phase  or  flight  phase)  within  the  eligibility  period, IAW  Paragraph  5.5.3.1 the SUAS-O loses the qualification covered by  the evaluation  and the  restrictions  of  Paragraph  5.6.3  apply.    Qualification  may  be  re-established  by administering a requalification evaluation IAW Paragraph 5.2.5.2  Group commanders may approve waivers to preclude the re-accomplishment of completed requisites to complete the evaluation on a case-by-case basis.  Document such action with an MFR placed in the FEF. (T-2).  Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected flight evaluation form  under  Remarks  when  action  is  complete,  and  remove  the  MFR  from  the  FEF.  (T-2).  Memos  for  record  become  a  permanent  part  of  the  FEF  only  when  the  major  discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later flight evaluation form. 5.9.  Commander-Directed Downgrade. 5.9.1.  Purpose.    Any  commander  in  the  SUAS-O’s  chain  of  command  may  direct  a downgrade  to  an  intermediate  level  of  qualification/certification  or  unqualified/decertified status without administering an evaluation under the following guidance: 5.9.1.1.  For  flying-related  cases,  use  for  cause  only,  e.g.,  breach  of  flying  discipline  or flight safety, including incidents not observed by a SUAS-E, or observed by a SUAS-E of another crew specialty. 5.9.1.2.  For  non-flying-related  cases,  do  not  use  as  a  substitution  for,  or  in  lieu  of, administrative or judicial actions. (T-1).  Use in cases where such actions directly affect the  commander’s  confidence  in  the  SUAS-O’s  flying  or  performance  ability  to  safely operate the SUAS and/or equipment. (T-2). 5.9.1.3.  For a Commander-Directed Downgrade AF Form 8, only the commander signs as the Final Approving Officer.  See Paragraph 7.4.1 (T-2). 5.10.  Multiple  Qualification.  SUAS-O  s  may  be  required  to  maintain  qualification  in  two  or more distinctly different SUAS.  Evaluation requirements shall be specified in the AFI 115MDS, Volume 2.  Exception: AFMC shall define evaluation requirements for test operations. 5.10.1.  Qualification/Mission  Evaluations.    SUAS-Os  require  a  QUAL  evaluation,  and,  if applicable,  a  MSN  evaluation  in  each  SUAS  (MDS)  in  which  they  maintain  qualification IAW the appropriate AFI 11-5MDS, Volume 2. (T-2). 5.10.2.  Failure  to  Pass  a  Flight  Evaluation.  A  downgrade  resulting  from  a  Q-3  in  a QUAL/MSN  evaluation  applies  only  to  the  SUAS  for  which  the  evaluation  was administered,  unless,  in  the  opinion  of  the  evaluator,  the  discrepancy  is  applicable  to additional SUAS. 5.11.  SUAS-Os Flying Non-US Air Force SUAS or with Non-US Air Force Units.  SUAS-Os authorized to perform duties using non-US Air Force SUAS, or assigned or attached to non-US Air Force units for SUAS operations shall comply with host service, contractor, manufacturer, or host country guidance, except for the requirement to maintain a current physical. (T-1).  They do not necessarily comply with USAF guidance, including this volume and AFI 11-5MDS, Volume 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF units, they shall complete applicable requisites and be evaluated  for  any  periodic  USAF  evaluations  that  expired  during  their  tour.  (T-2).    The restrictions  in  Paragraph  5.6.3  apply  until  successful  evaluations  are  completed.    Notes:    1. 24 AFI11-502V2  19 AUGUST 2015 MAJCOMs  may  approve  exceptions  to  requirements  for  returning  SUAS-Os  to  complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if, after case-by-case review, they determine non-USAF  evaluations  are  equivalent  to  applicable  AFI  11-5MDS,  Volume  2  evaluations.  Document such action with an MFR placed in the FEF on top of the non-USAF flight evaluation form equivalent. (T-2).  2.  Air Force units that use non-US Air Force SUAS to execute an Air Force flying program shall comply with current Air Force guidance, unless exempted by proper authority. (T-1). 5.12.  Initial Cadre.  SUAS-Os who are appointed by their MAJCOMs as initial cadre either for a new mission set requiring a QUAL or MSN qualification or for a new MDS where no SUAS-E currently exists. Procedures for initial cadre are defined in AFI 11-5MDS, Volume 2. AFI11-502V2  19 AUGUST 2015 25 Chapter 6 SUAS-O EXAMINATION PROGRAM 6.1.  Purpose.  The SUAS-O examination program measures SUAS-O knowledge of normal and emergency  procedures,  threats,  and  other  information  essential  for  the  safe  and  effective operation  of  their  assigned  UAS  through  the  administration  of  written,  computer-based  or electronic  examinations.  Poor  testing  performance  on  examinations  indicates  areas  requiring increased training emphasis. 6.2.  Scope.  The  examination  program  in  this  chapter  includes  requisite  examinations  for periodic  evaluations  and  unit  periodic  examinations.   Requisite  examinations  include qualification written examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in  Paragraph 5.5.1    The  ability  to  focus  on  specific  knowledge  areas  is  enhanced  by  the  management  of examination content and use of appropriate MQFs. 6.3.  Administrative Procedures. 6.3.1.  Program Documentation.  Units shall describe the unit SUAS-O examination program in the unit supplement to this Instruction. (T-2). 6.3.2.  Computer-Based  or  Electronic  Examinations.   Computer  based  or  electronic information  management  tools  may  fulfill  the  requirement  for  examinations  as  outlined  in this Instruction. 6.3.3.  Retention of Examination Records.  The Stan/Eval function shall retain graded exam answer sheets/computer records until the AF Form 8 is completed. (T-2). 6.3.4.  Examination Question Review.  The Stan/Eval function shall review all MQFs, secure question  banks,  and  prepared  exams  for  accuracy  annually  and  after  any  changes  in  source documents. (T-2).  If a complete review was accomplished due to a source document change it  may  be  annotated  as  the  annual  review.    Units  shall  document  their  procedures  for reviewing  and  updating  MQFs  and  preparing  exams  in  their  unit  supplement  to  this instruction. (T-2). 6.4.  Requisite  Examinations.  SUAS-Os shall  complete  written  and  Boldface/CAPs examinations (if applicable) as requisites for periodic QUAL evaluations (see Paragraph 5.5.1), and any other examinations required by AFI 11-5MDS, Volume 2. (T-2). 6.4.1.  Requisite  Examination  Management.    With  the  exception  of  written  Boldface/CAPs examinations,  maintain  either  requisite  examinations  for  each  SUAS  position  or  generate  a unique test for each SUAS-O requiring an exam. 6.4.1.1.  If requisite examinations are maintained for each SUAS position: 6.4.1.1.1.  Units  are  required  to  develop  and  control  a  minimum  of  two  requisite examinations for each crew position. 6.4.1.1.2.  Units  having  ten  or  fewer  members  per  SUAS  position  require  only  one examination. 6.4.1.1.3.  When different  SUAS positions are responsible for the same information, units are not required to maintain separate examinations for each crew position. 26 AFI11-502V2  19 AUGUST 2015 6.4.1.1.4.  Change  a  minimum  of  50  percent  of  the  questions  on  requisite examinations each calendar year. 6.4.1.2.  If a unique test is generated for each SUAS-O requiring an exam: 6.4.1.2.1.  Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for test creation. 6.4.1.2.2.  Requisite exam databases shall contain a sufficient number of questions to ensure a probability of no more than 50 percent duplication of questions for each test generated. (T-2). 6.4.2.  Examination    Security.    Stan/Eval  personnel  shall  maintain  positive  control  of  all requisite  exams,  applicable  answer  sheets  and  associated  computer  based/electronic  media.  (T2). 6.4.3.  Grading Policy for Examinations. 6.4.3.1.  Minimum  Passing  Grade.    The  minimum  passing  grade  for  Boldface/CAPs exams is 100 percent. (T-2). The minimum passing grade for all other Stan/Eval requisite examinations is 85 percent. (T-2). 6.4.3.2.  Requisite  and  Boldface/CAPs  Examination  Grading  Restriction.    Units  shall grade  all  completed  requisite  and/or  Boldface/CAPs  exams  prior  to  the  SUAS-O’s  next flight. (T-2). Units shall describe how this restriction is enforced in the unit supplement to this instruction.  (T-2). 6.4.4.  Examination Question Sources. 6.4.4.1.  Written  Exam.  (T-2).    Exam  shall  consist  of  at  least  25  questions.    Questions shall  come  from  MQFs.    These  questions  shall  emphasize  system  knowledge  and information  necessary  for  safe  flight  and  mission  accomplishment.    A  minimum  of  5 questions shall be on airspace control measures and coordination procedures. 6.4.4.1.1.  MAJCOMs  shall  ensure  AFI  11-5MDS  MQFs  containing  approved questions for testing are available for use and distributed to applicable SUAS-Os. 6.4.4.1.2.  The  highest  level  organization  with  a  SUAS  Stan/Eval  function  shall develop  and  maintain  MQFs.  (T-2).    That  organization  shall  submit  these  MQFs  to MAJCOM/A3 for coordination with lead command. (T-2). 6.4.4.1.3.  HQ  AFSOC/A3V  shall  review  MQFs  annually  and  distribute  changes  to MQFs  as  necessary.    Units  may  supplement  MQFs  to  accommodate  local  testing procedures,  administrative  errors  and  reflect  recent  changes  to  systems  and/or operational procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed. 6.4.5.  Boldface/CAPs Requisite Examinations. 6.4.5.1.  SUAS-O  knowledge  of  applicable  Boldface/CAPs  shall  be  evaluated  through  a written examination as a requisite to all periodic QUAL evaluations. (T-2). 6.4.5.2.  Satisfactory  performance  for  the  Boldface/CAPs  examination  requires  writing the  proper  actions  in  the  correct  sequence,  not  necessarily  a  verbatim  response.    The SUAS-E shall assign a Boldface/CAPs grade (Q or U) on the flight evaluation form. (T-2). AFI11-502V2  19 AUGUST 2015 27 6.4.6.  Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam.  An evaluation shall not be complete until all failed items have been successfully re-accomplished. (T-2). 6.4.6.1.  Reexamination  Policy.    SUAS-Os  failing  a  requisite  examination  at  any  time shall be afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. (T-2).  For other than Boldface/CAPs, the SUAS-O shall be reevaluated using an alternate exam. (T-2). 6.4.6.2.  Reexamination  Period.    SUAS-Os  who  fail  a  requisite  examination  shall complete a successful reexamination by the end of the third month following the date of the  first  failure,  or  the  end  of  their  eligibility  period,  whichever  occurs  first.  (T-3).  Waiver authority to extend the time allowed to successfully complete the examination is the group  commander.    Document such waivers  with  an MFR placed in  the FEF of the affected  individual.  (T-2).    Incorporate  the  information  contained  in  the  MFR  onto  the affected  flight  evaluation  form  under  remarks  when  action  is  complete, and  remove  the MFR  from  the  FEF.  (T-2).    MFRs  become  a  permanent  part  of  the  FEF  only  when  the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is  not addressed or corrected by a later flight evaluation form. 6.4.6.3.  Boldface/CAPs  Reexamination  Restriction.  SUAS-Os  failing  a  Boldface/CAPs exam shall not control a SUAS until a successful reexamination is accomplished. (T-2). 6.4.6.4.  Supervised Status Requirement.  Place SUAS-Os who fail a requisite open book or  closed  book  examination  in  supervised  status  until  successful  retesting  is  completed. (T-2).    For  SUAS-Os  who  maintain  multiple  qualifications,  supervised  status  resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination applies only to the SUAS for which the examination was administered. 6.5.  Unit Periodic Examinations (optional).  Each group/unit Stan/Eval function may conduct periodic testing for all SUAS-Os.  The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional knowledge beyond the scope of requisite exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge,  and/or  operational  procedures,  etc.,  to  determine  if  knowledge  deficiencies  exist within the unit.  This exam may be open or closed book, but shall not count as a requisite exam, nor shall a requisite exam satisfy the requirement for a periodic exam. (T-2).  Units shall describe this program in the unit supplement to this Instruction, to include procedures for failed exams. 28 AFI11-502V2  19 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 7 DOCUMENTATION 7.1.  Scope.

Currency on all FCIF (FCIF Volume 1, Part B) items. 8.4.  Supplementary  Evaluations.  Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by a  commander  to  identify  and  evaluate  implemented  solutions  to  operational  problems.    These evaluations  are  most  often  administered  as  inspections  (using  specifically  prepared  checklists) where  results  are  reported  to  the  commander.    The  form  and  content  of  supplementary evaluations is at the discretion of the commander. 8.4.1.  Supplementary evaluations are not SUAS-O qualification evaluations. 8.4.2.  Commanders  shall  determine  evaluated  areas.  (T-2).    The  Stan/Eval  function  shall determine  the  method  of  evaluation,  is  responsible  for  administrative  management  of  data collection, and shall report results as directed by the commander. (T-2). 8.4.3.  Individuals  other  than  SUAS-Es,  as  determined  by  the  Group/CC,  may  conduct supplementary evaluations. (T-3). 8.4.4.  Supplementary  evaluations  may  be  administered  in  conjunction  with  a  flight evaluation.    If  conducted during flight  operations, supplementary  evaluations should not  be all  encompassing,  nor  result  in  the  assignment  of  an  overall  rating  for  any  specific  crew member, nor be documented on a flight evaluation form. 8.4.5.  Supplementary evaluation results shall be documented in SEB minutes.  (T-2). 8.5.  Stan/Eval  Board  (SEB).  Group commanders shall chair a semi-annual SEB.  (T2).

The group SUAS-E shall coordinate the schedule, agenda, and attendees for the semi-annual SEB. (T-2).  The resulting SEB minutes shall be sent to the appropriate Group, MAJCOM and HQ AFSOC/A3OU no later than 30 days after the conclusion of the SEB. (T-2).  Formal  SEB  requirements  may  be  waived  by  the  MAJCOM  when  unit  tasking  impacts  the conduct of the unit’s SEB.  Notify HQ AFSOC/A3VU if an SEB will not be held at the required interval.  (T-2).    Groups  shall  consolidate  unit  SEB  minutes  to  validate  group-wide  trends,  if applicable. (T-2). 8.6.  Trend Analysis Program.  (T-2).  Stan/Eval organizations at the group and unit level shall establish  a  Trends  Analysis  Program.  Group  and  unit  commanders  are  the  final  authority  for establishing their unit’s trends. 8.6.1.  The  group/unit  shall  establish  specific  trend  analysis  threshold  percentages  and procedures.  The  trend  analysis  program  shall  include  an  objective  analysis  of  all  SUAS-O evaluations, written examinations, and SUAS operations during exercises and contingencies. Group  and  unit  Chief  of  Stan/Eval  shall  report  both  positive  and  negative  trend  data, recommend corrective actions, assign an OPR/OCR, and report the status to the SEB. 8.6.2.  After identification of a trend, each unit shall provide increased training emphasis on that trend for at least two consecutive quarters. 8.6.3.  The report information shall be included in the minutes and follow-up actions shall be addressed at the subsequent SEBs until the discrepancies are closed.  The Chief of Stan/Eval shall maintain the trend analysis data for a minimum of one year. 8.6.3.1.  For  ground  phase  test  consider  the  validity  of  the  question,  and  the  need  for and/or appropriateness of increased emphasis in the question’s subject area. 8.6.3.2.  For flight phase evaluation, calculate the percentage of Q-1, Q-2 and Q-3 grades against  the  total  number  of  evaluations  given  in  the  sub-area.  Trends  are  not  always identified  by  a  threshold  percentage,  but  may  be  determined  by  the  commander’s assessment as a potential weakness area. 8.6.3.3.  For  SUAS  trends,  calculate  the  percentage  of  loss-of-link  (LOL),  GPS  signal loss,  and  specific  damages  against  the  total  number  of  flight  hours/sorties  flown.
