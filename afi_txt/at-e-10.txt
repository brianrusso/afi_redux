The ASR radar segment of the system is the AN/GPN-20(V).  Either the AN/GPN- 22(V) or theAN/FPN-62 PAR radar sets may be connected to the OPS segment, through remote microwave link (RML) orlandlines, to complete the system.  Operator positions in the OPS segment provide controllers ASR and PARdisplays, controls, and communications facilities.  Landlines connect the OPS segment to the control tower,runway visual range system, weather dissemination system, wind speed and direction system, and up to 26remote radio channels.  The ASR and PAR segments are capable of 24 hour operation with minimalmaintenance.  Figure 1-l shows the ASR portion of the OPS segment.   Basic and expanded configurations ofthe OPS segment are displayed in figure 1-2.  Three ASR and two PAR positions are available in the basicconfiguration, five ASR and three PAR in the expanded configuration.

ASR MonitorASR MONITORThe ASR monitor (figure 2-2) provides the controller a visual indication of the surveillance radarperformance.  Indicator 1amp intensity is control1ed by the ILLUM control (1, figure 2-2).  When channels Aand B are operating properly, the green NORMAL lamps (2 and 7, figure 2-2 ) will be 1it.  When systemdegradation occurs, one or both of the amber DEGRADED lamps (3 and 6, figure 2-2 ) will light.  Thecontroller may continue to use the display or if the radar presentation is acceptable.  If the display isunacceptable, or if the red FAIL lamps (4 and 5, figure 2-2) light, the controller should switch tosingle-channel operation by using the ASR System Control Panel on the supervisor console.  The controllershould select a channel that has a NORMAL indication.  If both channels indicate a DEGRADED or FAILcondition when the radar is operating in the frequency diversity configuration, the controllershould first select channel A, then channel B, single-channel operation.  Leave the channel that has aNORMAL indication on-line.  All DEGRADED or FAIL conditions must be reported to maintenancepersonnel.  The controller must be aware that single-channel operation reduces the strength of radarreturns and the intensity of radar video.  System failure or degradation will not effect beacon targetinformation unless the failure is in the ASR antenna rotation system.  The momentary LAMP TEST switch(8, figure 2-2) provides a means of identifying faulty ASR Monitor lamps.RVR DISPLAY EQUIPMENTThe Runway Visual Range ( RVR ) Programmer and Remote Display (figure 2-3) consist of 3 sections thatdisplay the visibility of an associated runway in hundreds of feet.  The 3 digit display (1, figure 2-3 ) providea digital visibility readout for the runway selected (13, figure 2-3) on the RVR Remote display programmerlocated at ASR position 6.  The D and N lamps (4 and 6, figure 2-3) indicate whether readout calculations arebased on day (D) or night (N) 1ight conditions.  Calculations also consider the runway 1ight intensitysetting that is indicated by the lamps labeled 3, 4, and 5 (3, 5, and 7, figure 2-3).  If the RVR falls below arange that is preset on the Display Programmer with the ALARM SET (12, figure 2-3 ), the ALARM lamp ( 2,figure 2-3 ) will i11uminate and an aural alarm wi11 sound.  Intensity of the D, N, 3, 4, and 5 lamps iscontrolled by the ILLUM control (11, figure 2- 3).  The SCRIBBLE STRIP (8, figure 2-3) is used to mark therunway numbers associated with each readout section.  Use a grease pencil or other suitable nonabrasivemarker.  The POWER ON/OFF switch (10, figure 2-3) controls power to the display panels.  The indicatingfuse holder (9, figure 2-3) will illuminate when there is a blown fuse in the display panel power line.89101                  2     3      4     5    6      7SECTION     1ALARM  D     N3      4      5SECTION     2ALARM  D     N3      4      5SECTION    3ALARM  D     N3      4      5ILLUMONOFFPOWERFUSE1 AMPSLOW11RVR  REMOTE  DISPLAY  SLAVE1                  2     3      4     5    6      7     12    8     13SECTION     1ALARM  D     NALARMSETRUNWAYSELECT3      4      5SECTION     2ALARM  D     NALARMSETRUNWAYSELECT3      4      5SECTION    3ALARM  D     NALARMSETRUNWAYSELECT3      4      5ILLUMONOFFPOWERFUSE1 AMPSLOW11                                                                     10               9RVR  REMOTE  DISPLAY  PROGRAMMERFigure 2-3MONITOR SELECT UNITEach monitor select unit consists of three 3-position toggle switches (1, figure 2-4) to provide the controllerthe capability of monitoring a conversation at another position, or allows a conversation between theselecting and the selected operators.  Table 1-1 lists the number of monitor channels available at eachposition.  When the monitor select switch is held in the AUDIO (up) position, two-way communications(headset-to-headset) are established between the selected and selecting positions.  The switch is springloaded and returns to the off (center) position when released from the AUDIO position.  When the switch isset to the MON (monitor) position, the controller is able to monitor the conversation of the selectedposition.

The MASTER DIV ON indicator on the new MasterChannel will light and the MASTER DIV ON on the previous Master Channel will extinguish.  the Masterdesignation is now changed over to the other channel.SINGLE CHANNEL OPERATIONThe following procedures provide instructions for changing the ASR mode of operation from frequencydiversity or off -line maintenance to single-channel operation.1.  Depress the ANTENNA ON/ANTENNA OFF switch to the ANTENNA ON position and observe that theREADY indicator for the selected channel is lighted.2.  Depress the HV ON/HV OFF switch of the selected channel to HV ON and the other channel HV ON/HVOFF switch to HV OFF.3.  Depress the ON LINE/OFF LINE switch of the selected channel to the ON LINE ( ON LINE indicator willlight) position.  Depress the other channel ON LINE/OFF LINE switch to the OFF LINE position as follows:if the alternate channel is to be placed in the standby mode, select OFF LINE at the SYSTEMCONTROL panel; if the alternate channel is to be placed in the maintenance mode, select OFF LINE at theSYSTEM CONTROL panel and then have maintenance personnel in the maintenance segment press OFFLINE at Maintenance Control Panel.SECTION 6SPECIM OPERATING PROCEDURESGENERALThis section provides a lasting of required actions when certain emergency alarm conditions or equipmentmalfunctions occur:When an equipment failure occurs, notify maintenance personnel as soon as possible to restore systemoperation.OPS SEGMENT BAIL-OUT ALARMThe OPS Segment Bail-Out Alarm is activated by personnel from a remote site (normally the control tower)to warn personnel in the Of Segment of an impending hazard that would jeopardize their safety.  When thealarm sounds, it may be the Bail-Out Alarm or the communications equipment fuse-out alarm asthey both sound the same.  Immediately press the Fuse-Out Alarm Mute Switch at the supervisor's console.If the alarm continues to sound when the switch is pressed, all personnel must evacuate the OPS Segmentimmediately.  If the alarm is silenced after pressing the switch, notify maintenance personnel of thecommunications system fuse failure.OPS SEGMENT AC POWER FAILUREA back -up emergency power battery system is provided in the OPS segment in case of an AC power failure.The battery system provides continued operation of the communications equipment, bail-out alarm system,and the obstruction lights for up to 10 minutes.  Additionally, the OPS segment emergency lightswill operate for 12 minutes.ASR FAILURESTable 6-1 lists possible fault indications, caused by partial equipment failure, that can be observed on ASRdisplay consoles, performance monitors, or the system and receiver control panel.  The remedial actionslisted in table 6-1 provide instructions for the controller if a failure occurs.  If a complete failure to theprimary (ASR) or secondary (Beacon) radar occurs, the operating radar system can be used for controllingaircraft unti1 the other radar system is operational.  The controller observing the fault indication shouldpromptly notify the supervisor, in addition to performing the remedial action listed in table 6-1.     ASR FAULT ISOLATION                                        REMEDIAL ACTIONOne of the ASR Monitor                  lamps light.
