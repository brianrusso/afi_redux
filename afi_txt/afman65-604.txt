How To Use This Manual: 1.1.1.  Don't reprint or stock annual codes beyond the year in which they are current. However, if you belong to a comptroller activity, you may refer to previous codes as long as you need to. For pre-FY99 appropriation act symbols and codes, see previous editions of AFMAN 65-604, AFI 65-601V4, and AFR 172-1V IV. 1.1.2.  Time Limits for Appropriations: 1.1.2.1.  A single-year appropriation (578XXXX and 978XXXX) begins 1 Oct 2017, expires on 30 Sep 2018, and cancels 30 Sep 2023. 1.1.2.2.  A two-year appropriation (578/9XXXX and 978/9XXXX), such as RDT&E, begins 1 Oct 2017, expires on 30 Sep 2019, and cancels on 30 Sep 2024. 1.1.2.3.  A  three-year  appropriation  (578/0XXXX  and  978/0XXXX),  such  as  those  for procurement, begins 1 Oct 2017, expires on 30 Sep 2020, and cancels on 30 Sep 2025. 1.1.2.4.  Five-year appropriations (578/2XXXX and 978/2XXXX) begin on 1 Oct 2017, expire on 30 Sep 2022, and cancel 30 Sep 2027. 1.1.2.5.  A no-year appropriation is designated by an “X” after the Agency two digit prefix, i.e., 57X or 97X, which means there are no time limits on the availability of funds in the appropriation. Funds do not expire, which means they are available until completely expended. However, OMB or  the  Agency  Head  may  cancel  no-year  authority  provided  that  the  purpose  for  which  the authority was provided has been carried out and there have been no disbursements against the authority for at least two fiscal years. 1.2.  How To Read Chapters 2 and 14: 1.2.1. In  Chapter  2,  Air  Force  DoD  appropriations  appear  grouped  by  appropriation  type  and  in numerical order. Supplemental appropriations that have a unique appropriation symbol follow the primary appropriation. 1.2.2.  Each appropriation classification in paragraph 2.1 consists of an agency code, a fiscal year designation, and an appropriation symbol. 1.2.2.1.  The first two digits identify the agency code. The Air Force agency code is 57. The DoD agency code is 97. The Navy (including Marine Corps) agency code is 17. The Army agency code is 21. 1.2.2.2.  For one-year accounts, the third digit identifies the fiscal  year;  for  example, 5783400 designates  the  FY  2018  Operation  and  Maintenance,  Air  Force,  appropriation.  For  multiyear accounts, the third and fourth digits identify the multiple fiscal  years of the appropriation; for example, 578/03010 designates the FY 2018/2020 Aircraft Procurement, Air Force appropriation. No year funding may or may not have a fiscal year after the agency code. For example, BRAC has no fiscal years after the agency codes. BRAC’s fiscal years are determined by the limit. The limit is the 4 digit alpha - numeric after the treasury symbol. AFMAN65-604  1 OCTOBER 2017     1.2.2.3.  The remaining digits (usually four) indicate the appropriation or account. 15 1.2.3.  Each appropriation also has a two-digit fund code, which is identified both in the appropriation summary at paragraph 2.1 and in the detailed listing of codes that follows in Chapter 2. 1.2.4.  The individual appropriation listing in table 2.1 includes a brief description of the appropriation or account content. Where applicable, each section also contains the individual program, project and sub-project codes for budget execution. 1.2.5.  Chapter 14 identifies the Air Force's centrally managed OBAs and allotments. Look under the funding  appropriation  in  Chapter  2  for  the  account  and  subaccount  codes  used  to  execute  these centrally managed accounts. 1.2.6.

Inclusion  of  AFEEIC  in  MILPERS  Lines  of  Accounting  for  PCS/TDY  Travel.  Effective  1 October 2017, Air Force MILPERS PCS and TDY travel transactions will require an Air Force Element of Expense (AFEEIC).  This change will capture an AFEEIC in addition to the MILPERS project/sub-project in the line of accounting for all MILPERS travel transactions.  Due to system changes required in AROWS-G and AROWS-R, the ANG and Reserve will be exempted from this change until further notice.  7.46.  Revised Transportation Account Codes Effective 1 October 2017.  The next major fiscal coding change  was  the  Transportation  Accounting  Code  which  must  be  used  on  the  military  PCS  orders  for member household good shipments.  Effective 1 October 2017, the Active Duty PCS Travel Sub-Project relationships  to  the  Transportation  Account  Codes  (TACs)  have  been  modified  by  SAF/FMBOP  in conjunction with the SAF/FM AFAFO, Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) PCS Budget Office, AFPC Transportation  Office,  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  (AFRC)  (AF  Executive  for  the  Reserve  Travel System (RTS) used to process PCS travel vouchers) and DFAS Transportation Global Edit Table (TGET) personnel in the DFAS environment.  Active duty PCS orders are generally issued by AFPC for military members.  The military member is generally authorized to move their household goods between duty stations based on the travel categories listed in the following table.  The PCS travel order must include the unique Transportation Account Code (TAC)  on  the  actual  orders  in  addition  to  the  Standard  Number  (SDN)  and  other  line  of  accounting information. The TAC is used by the Transportation Personal Property Shipping Office(s) to charge the household goods, unaccompanied hold baggage, privately owned vehicles and non-temporary storage to the applicable line of accounting.  The TAC identification is included in multiple transportation systems based on the TGET table information loaded and controlled by SAF/FMBOP on an annual basis for the active duty military PCS account.  SAF/FMBOP provides the Air Force TGET upload information for basic symbol 3500 with a combination of the TAC, Fiscal Year and the Financial Billing Mode Codes.  This combination of codes is linked directly to a unique line of accounting unique to the PCS travel category.  7.47.  Reserved for future use.  7.48.  Revised  TAC  Codes  for  Active  Duty  PCS  Travel  (3500).

Applied research is systematic study to understand the means to meet a recognized and specific national security requirement. It is a systematic application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems or methods. It may include design, development, and improvement of prototypes and new processes to meet general mission area requirements. Applied research translates  promising  basic  research  into  solutions  for  broadly  defined  military  needs,  short  of  system development. This type of effort may vary from systematic mission - directed research beyond that in Budget Activity 1 to sophisticated breadboard hardware, study, programming, and planning efforts that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges. It includes studies, investigations, and non - system specific technology efforts. The dominant characteristic is that applied research is directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters. Applied research precedes system specific research. Program control of the Applied Research program element is normally exercised by general level of effort.      132                     8.3.1.  Program elements in this category involve pre-Milestone B efforts, also known as Concept and Technology  Development  phase  tasks,  such  as  concept  exploration  efforts  and  paper  studies  of alternative concepts for meeting a mission need.
