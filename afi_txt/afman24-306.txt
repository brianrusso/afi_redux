SUMMARY OF CHANGES This publication has been substantially revised.  This publication, previously managed jointly by the  Army  and  Air  Force  (published  respectively  as  Training  Circular  (TC)  21-305-20  and AFMAN 24-306), is now solely an Air Force owned publication.  This change allows the OPR to address  specific  issues  and  concerns  for  the  Air  Force  Vehicle  Operator.    The  title  of  this publication has changed from AFMAN 24-306 (I), Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Operator, to AFMAN  24-306,  Operation  of  Air  Force  Government  Motor  Vehicles.    Significant  changes include:    adoption  of  revised  AFI  24-301,  Vehicle  Operations;  addition  of  roles  and responsibilities  section  for  applicable  parties;  addition  of  Standard  Air  Force  Hand  and  Arm Signals for spotter safety to establish safety and continuity Air Force wide; revision guidance for lesson plans development responsibility and management; addition of Attachment 1, Glossary of References  and  Supporting  Information,  and  Attachment  2,  International  Military  Route  Signs, Traffic Control Visual Signals, and Control Signals for Military Vehicles in Convoys;  identifies tiered  waiver  authorities  for  unit  level  compliance  items.    Previously  consisting  of  twenty-two chapters; the rewritten publication now consists of fourteen chapters.  Chapter 8 (Operation of Government Vehicles Off-Post/Base), Chapter 13 (Trucks, Tractors, Semitrailers, and Special-Purpose Vehicles), and Chapter 22 (Onboard Material Handling Equipment (MHE)) have been removed.  Appendix A through Appendix G have been removed.   Chapter 3 through Chapter 14  have  undergone  substantial  reorganization,  content  changes,  content  removal,  content additions  and  consolidation  between  the  original  existing  chapters  in  order  to  provide  an effective, comprehensive, readable, and sequentially logical progression of material found in this rewritten publication.

Introduction.  Military  and  civilian  operators  of  AF  government  motor  vehicles  (GMVs) are required to meet specific qualifications to be certified, know operator responsibilities, and be familiar with the forms that pertain to the operations of AF GMVs.  The term “Driver” has been replaced  with  the  term  “Operator”  throughout  this  publication.    The  term  driver  implies  that Airmen are only required to drive the vehicle. Today’s military operator does considerably more than just drive.  The term operator denotes a level of competence in the safe operation as well as an understanding of the vehicle’s capabilities and limitations.  This includes an understanding of current sub-components such as technologically advanced communications, navigation, intercom systems,  onboard  material  handling  cranes,  self-recovery  winches,  integrated  night-vision devices,  weapons  support  systems,  onboard  electronic  diagnostic  systems,  and load responsibility.

Official  Use  of  GMVs:  GMVs  are  closely  controlled  because  of  their  easy  accessibility, high visibility and potential for misuse.  DoDM 4500.36, Acquisition, Management, and Use of DoD Non-Tactical Vehicles implements federal law (e.g., 31 USC §1344 and 40 USC §601-611) and prescribes the limited use of GMVs to official governmental purposes.  Unauthorized use of GMVs  results  in  unnecessary  expenditure  of  funds  and  creates  public  criticism.    Commanders, operators of AF GMVs and the base populace must be familiar with vehicle-use restrictions and what constitutes official use.  (T-0). 2.1.1.  Initial/Annual  Training  Requirement:   The  unit  VCO,  or  commanders  with permanently assigned GMVs, will brief their personnel on Air Force policy regarding official use, accident reporting procedures, vehicle abuse, discrepancy reporting, proper backing/use of spotters and use of DD Form 518, SF 91 and SF 94 annually.  (T-1).  This training will be documented and tracked by the unit VCO or commander in a central location (VCO binder, electronic database, individuals training record, etc.).  (T-1). 2.1.1.1.  Operators  of  AF  GMVs  will  operate  GMVs  for  official  use  only  and  in compliance with this manual, federal, state and local laws pertaining to the proper, safe, and efficient operation of AF GMVs.  (T-0). 2.1.2.  Restrict use of all GMVs, including those rented or leased, for official purposes only, e.g., in support of authorized DoD functions, activities, or operations only.  (T-0). 2.1.3.  GMVs  will  not  be  provided  solely  or  principally  to  enhance  the  comfort  or convenience of member(s).  (T-0). 2.1.4.  Transportation by a GMV shall not be provided when the justification is based solely on reasons of rank, position, prestige or personal convenience.  (T-0). 2.1.5.  GMVs will not be authorized for transporting DoD or other personnel over all or any part of the route between their domiciles and places of employment except as authorized in AFI 24-301.  (T-0). 2.1.6.  When questions arise about the official use of a GMV, they will be resolved in favor of strict compliance with statutory provisions and AFI 24-301.  (T-0).  Refer requests which appear the  Vehicle  Operations  Element Noncommissioned  Officer  In  Charge  (NCOIC)  for  review.    The  servicing  legal  office  also serves as a valuable resource in aiding commanders in their determinations. to  conflict  with  governing  directives to 2.1.7.  In  the  National  Capital  Region  (NCR),  Administrative  Instruction  (AI)  109,  Use  of Motor  Transportation  and  Scheduled  DoD  Shuttle  Service  in  the  Pentagon  Area  takes precedence. Section 2B—General-Use Responsibilities 2.2.  General-Use Responsibilities:  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 23 2.2.1.  All  personnel  will remain current  with  this Air Force Manual  (AFMAN) and  related installation policy and/or instructions.  (T-1). 2.2.2.  Alcoholic  beverages  will  not  be  consumed  in  GMVs.    (T-0).    Operators  will  not consume alcohol 8 hours prior to duty or prior to operating any GMVs.  (T-0).  Operators are ultimately responsible for exercising good judgment by imposing additional time constraints as needed. 2.2.3.  Use  of  personal  or  government-issued  hand-held  wireless  phones  or  text  messaging equipment or any other type of electronic devices will not be used while operating a GMV.  (T-0).    The  use  of  hands-free  communication  equipment  (blue-tooth  enabled  vehicles, speakerphones,  single-bud  earphones,  mounted  phones,  etc.)  may  be  used  IAW  applicable local laws. 2.2.4.  Tobacco products will not be used in GMVs.  (T-0). 2.2.5.  Food will not be consumed while operating a GMV.  (T-0). 2.3.  Making Official Use Determinations:  When questions arise about the use of GMVs, they shall be resolved in favor of strict compliance with statutory provisions and the policies of AFI 24-301.    (T-0).    When  guidance  does  not  specifically  fit  a  request  for  transportation  support, commanders must document answers to the following prior to approving the use of a GMV: (T-0). 2.3.1.  The  purpose  of  the  vehicle  use  must  be  essential  to  the  successful  completion  of  a DoD function, activity, or operation.  (T-0). 2.3.2.  The  purpose  of  the  vehicle  use  must  be  consistent  with  the  purpose  for  which  the GMV was acquired.  (T-0). 2.3.3.  If  provided,  GMV  transportation  used  must  be  the  most  cost  effective  method  of satisfying the requirement, consistent with AFI 24-301.  (T-0). 2.4.  Priority  of  Transportation  Services:  When  vehicle  transportation  is  essential  to  the performance of official business, the following methods shall be considered in the order shown to the extent they are available and capable of meeting mission requirements:  (T-0). 2.4.1.  Scheduled DoD bus service. 2.4.2.  DoD specially scheduled leased or owned bus service. 2.4.3.  Van pools. 2.4.4.  GMV  centrally  dispatched  “taxicab”  operation.    (Example:    Operator  and  Vehicle support requested from Vehicle Operations). 2.4.5.  GMV individually dispatched to licensed service member or civilian employee. (Example:  Unit assigned vehicle or U-Drive-It from Vehicle Operations). 2.5.  Vehicle-Misuse Reporting:  Report all suspected misuses to LRS Vehicle Operations. (T-1).  Vehicle Operations conducts an initial technical assessment of the incident to determine if regulatory official use guidance may have been violated.  Note:  AF/A4LR serves as the primary point-of-contact (POC) for misuses or reckless vehicle operation allegations reported to General Services Administration (GSA).  24 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 2.5.1.  Vehicle  Operations  collects  the  information  and  conducts  a  technical  assessment  for review  IAW  AFI  24-301.    Vehicle  Operations  then  forwards  allegations  along  with  the technical  assessment  to  the  LRS  commander  and  then  to  the  appropriate  unit  commander.  Commanders  have  15  calendar  days  to  respond  to  the  LRS  commander's  assessment  and identify  actions  taken  to  prevent  further  occurrences  (if  appropriate).    Unit  commander responses will address requirements identified in paragraph 2.3.  (T-1). 2.5.2.  Vehicle Operations maintains a log of reported misuse cases IAW AFI 24-301. 2.6.  Penalties  for  Misuse  of  DoD  Motor  Vehicles:  The  unauthorized  or  willful  misuse  of  a DoD  motor  vehicle  will  be  cause  for  disciplinary  action  as  described  in  DoDM  4500.36., Enclosure 5, paragraph 7.  (T-0).  This includes action against military members for violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ. Section 2C—Authorized Uses of GMVs for Temporary Duty Support 2.7.  Temporary Duty:  Transportation may be provided between lodgings and duty stations for personnel  on  temporary  duty  when  public  or  commercial  resources  are  inadequate  or nonexistent.  The temporary duty status of an individual does not necessarily justify the use of a GMV or its use for personal convenience.  Use of the vehicle will always be predicated on need, distance  involved,  and  other  conditions  that  justify  their  use  to  further  the  DoD  and  Air  Force mission.    (T-0).    Note:    See  AFI  24-301  for  alternative  transportation  support  for  TDY personnel.   When an adequate DoD or commercial  bus system is  available or can be provided, the use of any GMV or commercial rental car is prohibited.  When authorized, a GMV may be used for: 2.7.1.  Sustenance:    Between  places  of  business  or  lodging  and  eating  establishments, pharmacy,  barber  shops,  places  of  worship,  laundry  cleaning  establishments  and  similar places required for sustenance of the member whether on- or off-base.   If used off-base for sustenance,  restrict  GMV  use  to  reputable  establishments  in  reasonable  proximity  to  the installation.  (T-0). 2.7.1.1.  Reasonable proximity is established by the installation commander’s official use policy.  (T-1).  Reputable is defined as an establishment that does not create a perception that will reflect unfavorably on the DoD or Air Force or cause public criticism no matter what the venue is. 2.7.1.2.  GMVs will not be taken to adult-oriented/themed establishments.  (T-1). 2.7.2.  Entertainment  and  Morale:    Between  places  of  business  or  lodging  and  local installation  bowling  centers,  officer/enlisted/all-ranks  clubs,  gymnasiums  or  any  on-base Non-Appropriated  Funds  (NAF)  activity  (i.e.,  golf  courses,  rod  &  gun  clubs,  and  theaters) facilities  required  for  the  comfort  or  health  of  the  member.    The  use  of  GMVs  for transportation  to  any  off-base  entertainment  or  recreational  facilities,  to  include  those  on other installations is prohibited.  (T-1).  Installation commanders may authorize an exception for situations where the installation does not have a fitness center and designated gymnasium is on another installation or in local community per Community Partnership agreement. 2.7.3.  IAW AFI 32-6003, General Officer Quarters (GOQ) Management, Special Command Position  (SCP)  housing  is  occupied  by  a  general  officer  or  civilian  equivalent  and  carries public entertainment responsibilities requiring the incumbent to represent the interests of the  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 25 United  States  in  official  and  social  activities  involving  foreign  and  domestic  dignitaries.  GMV use by TDY personnel (to include Invitational Travel Authorization (ITA) travelers as passengers)  to  attend  these  official  events  is  authorized.    SCP  housing  will  be  identified  in the installation’s official use policy.  (T-1).  Installation Protocol office will be the POC for official events.  (T-1). Section 2D—Standard Authorized Uses of GMVs for Permanent Party Mission Support 2.8.  Permanent  Party:  The  purpose  of  the  vehicle  use  must  be  essential  to  the  successful completion of a DoD function, activity, or operation IAW  paragraph 2.3.  (T-0).  Official use for  active  duty  personnel  includes  transportation  to  or  from  Air  Force  scheduled  appointments on-  or  off-base,  e.g.,  Military  Personnel  Section  (MPS)  records  check,  dental  appointments, commander’s calls (special consideration must be taken to prevent transportation that circumvent Official-use  rules  for  purposes  of  morale  or  personal  convenience),  urinalysis  testing  and hospital  outpatient  appointments.    (T-1).    GMV  travel  is  not  authorized  for  elective  surgery, procedures  or  treatments  where  the  member  would  otherwise  not  be  entitled  to  government travel.  Use transportation priorities specified in paragraph 2.4. 2.8.1.  Permanent Party personnel conducting official off-base duties are authorized to stop at off-base eating establishments in the immediate vicinity or direct route of the off-base work site.    Stopping  at  (on-  or  off-base)  private  quarters  for  any  reason  or  stopping  for shopping/personal  convenience  purposes  is  prohibited.    The  intent  is  to  allow  for  those personnel  working  away  from  their  duty  location,  for  extended  periods,  the  opportunity  to obtain  meals  without  incurring  an  additional  time/fuel  cost  of  returning  to  the  installation.  This is not to be taken as authority to stop as a matter of personal convenience when in transit between sites, whether on- or off-base. 2.8.2.  Personnel  conducting  official  off-base  duties  are  authorized  to  respond  to  personal emergencies  that  may  arise  while  they  are  conducting  off-base  duties  in  a  GMV.    Personal emergencies are defined as notification of a life threatening or serious injury to themselves or a dependent or substantial damage to personal property, such as a home fire.  Example:  Off-base  personnel  with  a  GMV  receives  notification,  at  that  time,  of  a  personal  emergency.  Personnel  may  respond  as  it  is  more  time  and  cost  effective  for  the  Air  Force  to  have  the individual proceed to  the emergency event  directly  (home, school,  hospital,  accident scene) rather than return to the installation/duty location to retrieve their personal vehicle.  The unit commander will notify the LRS commander any time these actions have been exercised and take actions to have the GMV returned at the earliest opportunity.  (T-0). 2.8.3.  Commercial  Terminal  Transportation.    Use  of  resources  to  support  administrative activities, for which sufficient public transportation or commercial services exist to fulfill the need, detracts from direct mission support and should be avoided.  Use of GMVs for travel to transportation  terminal  are  location/instance  specific.  Contact  the  servicing  Vehicle Operations element and refer to the installation commander’s official use policy  and AFI 24-301 for more information.  (Note:  Terminal transportation is not authorized in the NCR and Pentagon Area IAW DoD AI 109.  See AFDW/A4L policy for specific guidance). 2.9.  Event Participation:  26 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 2.9.1.  Public  Ceremonies:    The  use  of  GMVs  may  be  authorized  for  military  and  civilian personnel  officially  participating  in  public  ceremonies,  military  field  demonstrations,  and parades directly related to official  activities.  “Official participation” is defined as activities similar  to  and  including:    Presiding  Officer,  Host,  Chaplain,  Master  of  Ceremonies,  Guest Speaker (e.g. Congressional Medal of Honor recipients, prior General Officers, Chief Master Sergeant  of  the  Air  Force  (CMSAF),  etc.)  and  Proffer.    Attendance  does  not  constitute “officially  participating”  even  if  the  public  ceremony  has  been  established  as  an  alternate duty location. 2.9.2.  Formal  Air  Force  Ceremonies:    The  use  of  GMVs  for  general  military  and  civilian invitee  participation  and  attendance  at  official  AF  ceremonies  (limited  to  changes  of command, promotions, graduations, retirements, unit activation and inactivation) held on an AF installation and not open to the public may be authorized by the installation commander.  Support  for  personnel  who  have  no  official  role  in  the  event  (i.e.,  general  invitees)  will  be within the confines of the installation and be limited to those situations where circumstances require shuttle transportation from general parking location, maximizing centralized parking.  (T-0).  Support will be in compliance with the priorities identified earlier in this chapter and may not conflict with mission requirements.  (T-0). 2.9.2.1.  Support  will  begin  and  end  at  officially  designated  areas,  not  a  personal residence/domicile.    (T-1).    This  is  not  to  be  interpreted  as  authority  to  transport personnel by other than authorized shuttle service. 2.9.2.2.  Support will be limited to official AF ceremonies and will not extend to socials or  pre-/post-event  activities.    (T-0).    It  is  the  responsibility  of  leaders  at  all  levels  to monitor  and  correct  abuse  of  this  policy.    Characterization  of  an  event  as  an  “official ceremony” for purposes of this paragraph does not create an entitlement to other forms of support  or  funding  for  the  ceremony;  such  support  must  be  established  and  justified  by the appropriate authority. 2.9.3.  Except  as  expressly  provided  in  paragraph  2.9.2.    using  general  shuttle  support, neither paragraph 2.9.1. nor  2.9.2. provides any authority to transport a member’s relatives or  personal  friends  invited  to  attend  activities  such  as  retirements,  promotions,  awards ceremonies,  dedications,  funerals  or  any  other  similar  type  functions.    Determinations regarding any question of authorized support for such activities will be resolved in favor of strict  compliance  with  rules  outlined  in  AFI  24-301  to  preclude  any  negative  public perception.  (T-0). 2.9.4.  General shuttle support from centralized parking may be used as a mitigation step to vulnerability assessments IAW AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism. 2.9.5.  The use of GMVs is authorized to transport immediate family members of the sponsor in  situations  involving  a  sponsor’s  death.    The  LRS  commanders  is  the  approval  authority.  (T-0).

Mission-Specific Authorizations:  Certain mission-specific allowances may be approved by  the  installation  commander  in  the  installation’s  Official-use  policy,  detailed  in  this  chapter and  AFI  24-301.    Units  will  submit  requests/justification  to  the  Deployment  and  Distribution  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 27 Flight  (DDF).  (T-1).  The consolidated package with the LRS commander’s recommendations will  be  coordinated  thru  the  office  of  the  Staff  Judge  Advocate  for  the  installation  commander and then to the installation commander for final approval.  (T-1).  Approval determinations will be  provided  to  each  requesting  unit  commander  and  VCO.    (T-1).    Mission-specific authorizations will be limited identified in the installation’s Official-use policy IAW AFI 24-301.  (T-0). 2.11.  Operations  Group  Commanders  (OG/CCs):  When  a  telecommunications-equipped, permanently  assigned  GMV  is  authorized,  OG/CCs  may  drive  that  GMV  to  on-base  eating establishments (Military  Dining  Facilities  and  NAF/AAFES/DECA  operated  eating establishments to include commissary and shoppette) while preforming their duties in connection with on-going flight operations.  The intent of the policy is to allow OG/CCs to use the assigned GMV  for  these  activities  while  maintaining  access  to  mounted  telecommunications  equipment.  This shall not to be interpreted as authority to use the GMV for stops at their residence or other domicile-to-duty transportation.  (T-0). 2.12.  Command  and  Control  Vehicle telecommunications-equipped, emergency  configured  non-tactical  GMVs  may  be  provided  on  a  24-hour-a-day  basis  to commanders  who  are  charged  by  the  DoD  Component  head  concerned  or  the  Chairman  of  the Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  (CJCS)  with  the  overall  sole  responsibility  for  security  or  operational function  of  an  installation  or  major  military  organization.

CACV  Use:  Use  of  command  and  control  vehicles  is  authorized  for  on-base  travel  to locations/tasks  related  to  personal  health  and  sustenance  (except  member’s  residence). Permanent party official use rules (paragraph 2.8.) apply for off-base travel and stops.  All other official-use  constraints  as  described  in  this  chapter  apply  to  command  and  control  vehicles.  CACVs will not denote domicile-to-duty transportation.  (T-0).  If a requirement for domicile-to-duty travel exists or for other questions regarding CACV use refer to AFI 24-301. Section 2F—Dependent and Pet or Service Animal Transportation Support 2.14.  General  Dependent  Transportation  Support:  Transportation of family members is the responsibility  of  the  sponsor.    Spouses  are  not  considered  representatives  of  the  United  States, DoD, or Air Force, except when traveling on an approved ITA (see paragraph 2.15.). 2.14.1.  Military  member  or  civilian  employee  spouses/dependents  may  be  transported  in GMVs only when: 2.14.1.1.

Section 3G—Operator Certification and Administrative Responsibility 3.17.  Operator  Certification:  Public  Law  99-570,  Title  XII,  The  Commercial  Motor  Vehicle Safety  Act  of  1986  established  minimum  national  standards  for  licensing  commercial  motor vehicle drivers.  The act  requires testing and licensing standards  for truck and bus operators to ensure  operators  have  a  working  knowledge  to  safely  operate  those  vehicles.    The  Vehicle Operations, TVO Section serves as the sole commercial equivalent vehicle certification authority on  the  installation.    The  TVO  program  ensures  Air  Force  licensed  operators  comply  with  the previously mentioned standards and provides certification services for all personnel assigned to the  installation.    Members  with  a  CDL  license  do  not  require  further  TVO  certification  for vehicles  covered  on  the  member’s  CDL.    The  TVO  program  is  an  installation  certification program and should not be confused with a training program.  Operator training remains a unit responsibility. 3.17.1.  A student operator will possess an AF Form 171, which serves as a learner’s permit, and be accompanied by a vehicle trainer while driving.  (T-1).  The AF Form 171 becomes a valid learner’s permit only after completing Section I, Trainee Information.  Block 21 must specify the specific vehicle types the trainee is being trained to operate.

Maintenance  Purposes  Only:  It is not necessary that vehicle management personnel be fully qualified in all operational aspects of the vehicle.  Maintenance Purposes Only training is documented using the AF Form 171.  (T-1).  Contact the servicing Vehicle Operations element or refer to AFI 24-301 for more information. TRAFFIC CONTROLS Section 4A—General Information 4.1.  General.  Except when specifically directed otherwise, military and civilian operators must comply with  all  civil  traffic laws  and ordinances.   (T-0).  Civilian traffic police have authority for  regulating  all  traffic  in  towns  and  on  public  roads.    Security  Forces  (SF)  has  full  authority over all military vehicles wherever they are located. Section 4B—Traffic Controllers 4.2.  Traffic Controllers:  Civilian authorities and SF normally control traffic using a system of signs,  signals,  devices,  and  markings.    When  an  authorized  official  (such  as  civilian  police, traffic control personnel, flagmen, SF, etc.) is directing traffic, operators of AF GMVs obey the given signals rather than traffic lights or signs.  Traffic officials usually signal traffic to stop by holding up their hands, palms toward traffic and by giving a long blast on their whistle.  To start traffic, he/she motions with his/her hand and arm toward the direction of travel, giving two initial short blasts with a whistle.  They use three blasts or a series of short blasts with a whistle to warn any motorists or pedestrians of unusual or dangerous conditions, approaching emergency, or to gain a motorist’s and/or pedestrian’s attention for various reasons.  At night, visual signals may be given with a flashlight or lighted traffic baton or wand.  Flagmen at railroad crossings or road construction sites use flags or color-coded sign paddles.  When driving in host nations, operators need to understand the visual signals used by traffic control personnel. Section 4C—Signals 4.3.  Signals:  Operators of AF GMVs must be familiar with the following categories of signals commonly used to control traffic:  (T-0). 4.3.1.  The  meaning  and  proper  use  of  hand  signals  common  to  military  and  civilian operators.  (T-1).  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 43 4.3.2.  The hand signals used by police to control traffic to include host nation police.  (T-0). Section 4D—Signaling Distance 4.4.  Signaling Distance:  Always signal in advance of making a turn or stopping.  If a signal is not given until the vehicle has already started to turn or stop, then the signal might as well have not been given.  Usually by that time, it is too late for other drivers to take whatever action may be necessary.  IAW traffic laws, operators of AF GMVs will signal at least 100 feet in advance (this is the minimum distance).  (T-0).  The faster the vehicle is traveling, the farther in advance that  the  signal  should  be  made.    Signaling  distance  should  never  be  less  than  the  distance required for stopping or  slowing down sufficiently to make a turn.  For example, a signal for a stop  when  traveling  40  miles  per  hour  (MPH)  should  never  be  given  less  than  140  feet  in advance of the stop.  When driving on the open highway, a good rule is to give all signals at least 300 feet in advance. Section 4E—Operator Hand Signals 4.5.  Operator Hand Signals:  Operator hand signals are used when turn signals are not visible due to weather or light conditions, emergency situations preventing visibility of turn signals, and when  a  vehicle’s  turn  signals  are  not  working.    Operator  hand  signals  are  given  using  the  left hand and arm out the operator’s window of left-hand drive vehicles (see Figure 4.1.).  The signal for stopping and slowing down is given by pointing the arm and hand down, palm back.  The left turn  signal  is  given  by  pointing  the  arm  and  hand  straight  out,  palm  forward.    The  right  turn signal is given by pointing the arm and hand straight up from the elbow, palm forward. 4.5.1.  Make signals  clearly and pay attention to  “body” language to  ensure that misleading signals  are  not  inadvertently  given  to  other  drivers.    Do  not  rest  elbows  on  the  windowsill and  idly  tap  the  top  of  the  vehicle  with  fingers,  or  let  hands  trail  out  the  window.    Drivers may  mistake  these  actions  for  signaling  a  turn,  slowing  down  or  stopping.    When  giving  a hand signal for a turn, finish signaling before actually making the turn so that both hands are on the wheel while performing the maneuver. Figure 4.1.  Operator Hand Signals. Section 4F—Signal Lights 4.6.  Signal Lights:  Almost all vehicles have at least one signal light, the brake light.  The brake light  lights  up  when  the operator  presses  the  brake  pedal  signaling  that  the  operator  is  slowing down or coming to a complete stop.   44 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Section 4G—Turn Signals 4.7.  Turn Signals:  Ensuring that the signal can be clearly seen is the important factor.  If turn signals  are  not  working  or  if  there  are  weather  conditions,  light  conditions,  an  emergency situation,  or  other  circumstances  that  prevent  the  turn  signals  from  being  visible;  use  hand signals. Section 4H—Emergency Flashers 4.8.  Emergency  Flashers:  Four-way  emergency  flashers  are  used  to  warn  motorists  that  a vehicle has come to a stop due to an emergency in a traffic lane or on the shoulder adjacent to a traffic lane.  When a vehicle halts in  an authorized space, emergency flashers are not normally used.    Four-way  emergency  flashers  are  not  a  substitute  for  warning  devices  contained  in  the highway warning kit. 4.8.1.  Vehicles operating on the flightline (such as maintenance servicing vehicles) may use four-way flashers where authorized instead of non-revolving, pulsating hazard warning lights prescribed  by  TO  36-1-191,  Technical  and  Managerial  Reference  for  Motor  Vehicle Maintenance. Section 4I—Horn Signaling 4.9.  Horn:  The vehicle’s horn is the best means an operator has of alerting other drivers of their presence.  If a vehicle coming from the opposite direction suddenly turns into your lane, apply the  brakes  and  blow  the  horn  at  the  same  time.    The  sound  of  the  horn  is  used  as  an  aid  in attempting to avoid a collision.  Also use the horn in the following situations: 4.9.1.  When entering traffic from a blind alley or driveway. 4.9.2.  When approaching and coming around curves on mountainous roads where visibility is limited. 4.9.3.  Immediately before backing. 4.9.4.  When entering/exiting a warehouse, hangar or garage. 4.9.5.  Since the only lawful use of the horn is to serve as a reasonable warning device, use the  horn  courteously.    Do  not  use  it  to  greet  friends  or  express  anger  at  another  driver’s errors.  Pressing the horn lightly, once or twice, normally gets the attention of another driver or pedestrian, a long blast is usually unnecessary.  Abide by overseas host nation traffic laws restricting use of horns in built up urban areas. Section 4J—Other Signals 4.10.  Other  Signals:  In  addition  to  hand  and  signal  lights,  drivers  constantly  signal  to  each other  merely  by  the  position  of  their  vehicles  on  the  road.    When  an  operator  is  seen  moving towards the center of the road, it is assumed that he/she is about to turn left or pull out to pass.  When seen moving to the right, it is assumed that he/she is going to turn right or stop. 4.10.1.  Operators  of  AF  GMVs  are  guided  by  the  position  signaling  of  other  drivers.  Misleading position signals are as dangerous as misleading hand signals.  The operator who  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 45 pulls  to  the  right  before  turning  left  is  inviting  an  accident  because  he/she  is,  in  effect, misinforming other drivers of his/her intentions. Section 4K—Traffic Signals 4.11.  Traffic  Signals:  No  traffic  signal  is  more  important  than  the  traffic  light  (see  Figure 4.2.).    Operators  usually  do  not  run  through  red  lights.    However,  always  be  alert  of  the  few drivers that do run through red lights.  If a light  turns to  yellow, prepare to stop.  One practice that often causes an accident is when an operator, who is stopped at a red light, watches the green light on the alternate side of traffic turn to  yellow.  Without waiting for the traffic light to turn red  and  for  the  traffic  to  come  to  a  complete  stop,  the  operator  begins  to  move  into  the intersection. Figure 4.2.  Traffic Signals.  Section 4L—Traffic Signs 4.12.  Traffic Signs:  The United States is moving toward an international system of traffic signs that  emphasizes  pictures  and  symbols  rather  than  written  messages.    Symbolic  signs  are  not entirely  new  and  have  several  advantages  over  word  messages.    Symbols  provide  an  operator with  instant  communication  since  the  operator  does  not  have  to  read  the  sign  which  help overcome  language  barriers.    Familiarity  with  the  symbolic  signs  helps  military  operators operating in overseas areas.  On signs that contain messages in words, color and shape provide the operator with information at first glance before he/she is close enough to read the words (see Figure 4.3. through Figure 4.6.).  46 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Figure 4.3.  Use of Colors in Signs.   Figure 4.4.  Use of Shapes in Signs.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 47 Figure 4.5.  Regulatory Signs. Figure 4.6.  Warning Signs.    48 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Section 4M—International Traffic Signs 4.13.  International  Traffic  Signs:  This  system  of  road  signs  was  agreed  upon  at  the  United Nations (UN) Conference on Road and Motor Transport in September 1949.  It was the goal of the UN to ensure safety and to facilitate international road traffic by adopting a uniform system of road signaling.  Although these signs are not military, all military personnel should be familiar with them since they are used in most overseas areas.  Dimensions of signs are standardized in each country to ensure maximum uniformity (see Attachment 2). Section 4N—International Military Route Signs in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Countries 4.14.  International  Military  Route  Signs  in  NATO  Countries:  NATO  countries  have standardized road signs.  These signs are shown and explained in Attachment 2. Section 4O—Pavement Markings 4.15.  Pavement  Markings  :    Pavement  markings  are  used  to  regulate  the  flow  of  traffic,  as well  as  guide  and  warn  operators  of  possible  approaching  hazards.    Markings  may  be  red, yellow,  blue  or  white  and  used  alone  or  in  combination  with  each  other,  giving  a  different meaning. 4.15.1.  Red curbs indicate no parking zones. 4.15.2.  Blue markings show parking spaces for persons with disabilities. 4.15.3.  Yellow  centerlines  indicate  that  there  is  two-way  traffic  flowing  in  opposite directions. 4.15.4.  White lines separate lanes of traffic going in the same direction. 4.15.5.  Pavement markings are widely used to  control the flow of traffic (see  Figure 4.7.).  These markings may be used to indicate the following: 4.15.5.1.  The middle of the road. 4.15.5.2.  No passing and passing zones by using a solid line for a no passing zone and a broken line for a passing zone. 4.15.5.3.  Crosswalks,  reduced  speed  zones,  school  zones,  and  approaches  to  railroad crossings.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 49 Figure 4.7.

Pavement Markings Continued.   AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 51 Chapter 5 BASIC OPERATING PROCEDURES AND MANEUVERS Section 5A—General Information 5.1.  Objective.  The objective of training an operator of an AF GMV is to teach him/her how to perform the job  efficiently with  maximum  safety, comfort,  and  economy.  Good driving habits are  attained  through  constant  practice.    During  daily  driving,  review  the  techniques  discussed below.  Test occasionally to keep information fresh.  Avoid slipping into bad, perhaps dangerous habits. 5.2.  Basic Responsibilities:  Operators of AF GMVs are responsible for the following: 5.2.1.  Safely  operating  the  vehicle  and  complying  with  applicable  federal,  state,  local,  and host nation (HN)  laws and regulations. 5.2.2.  While  operating  a  military  vehicle,  use  of  personal  or  government-issued  hand-held wireless phones or text messaging equipment or any other type of electronic devices will not be  used  while  operating  a  GMV.    (T-0).    The  use  of  hands-free  communication  equipment (blue-tooth enabled vehicles, speakerphones, single-bud earphones, mounted phones, etc.)  is authorized if allowed by local law. 5.2.3.  Conducting before-, during-, and after-operation inspections of the vehicle. 5.2.4.  Following all operator maintenance outlined in the appropriate TO. 5.2.5.  Caring for and cleaning the vehicle and its equipment at all times. 5.2.6.  Ensuring  the  safety  and  comfort  of  passengers  (includes  ensuring  that  seat  and shoulder belts  are safely fastened).  The GMV operator will ensure that  passengers  comply before operating the vehicle.  (T-0). 5.2.7.  Ensuring the security of the vehicle and cargo. 5.2.8.  Exercising common sense. 5.2.9.  Notify supervision  of any change in your status that may affect your ability to operate a  vehicle  (for  example,  inability  to  drive  due  to  physical  condition  or  withdrawal  of  your State Drivers License). 5.2.10.  Operators  of  GMVs  are  subject  to  corrective  action  by  commanders/squadron commanders for incidents of abuse, misuse, and damage to unit-assigned vehicles. 5.2.11.  Operators  of  GMVs  may  be  required  to  operate  two-way  radio  equipment.    Do  not attempt  to  operate  the  two-way  radio  equipment  in  the  vehicle  unless  instruction  has  been given  to  do  so.    Supervisors  should  determine  who  is  qualified  to  efficiently  operate equipment and furnish local standard procedures, codes and so forth.  52 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Section 5B—Basic Unit/VCO Responsibilities 5.3.  Unit/VCO Responsibilities.  The unit will provide the operator with required items for off-base travel.  (T-1).  All necessary vehicle forms will be included with the vehicle e.g., SF 91, AF Form 1800, DD Form 518 and SF 94.  (T-1). 5.4.  Toll Tickets/Transponders:  When off-base routes include locations where passage would require a toll,  prepaid  toll  tickets  or transponders may be furnished (if available) at  the time of travel.    If not,  follow local  policy  for being reimbursed for tolls  and parking fees.  Always ask the toll keeper for a receipt.  Upon returning, submit any toll receipts and/or unused toll tickets and/or transponder to the dispatcher. Section 5C—Operator of AF GMVs Health and Well-Being 5.5.  Operator  Health  and  Well-Being.  The  ability  to  operate  a  vehicle  is  not  the  only consideration of a safe operator. 5.5.1.  Physiological,  Psychological  and  Emotional  Considerations:    To  operate  a  vehicle with the maximum degree of safety, the operator should maintain healthy mental, emotional and  physical  condition.    Any  deterioration  in  mental  or  physical  condition  can  severely impact the safety of the operator and his/her surroundings. 5.5.1.1.  Instructors  and  supervisors  should  be  mindful  of  changes  in  an  operator’s physiological, psychological and emotional condition. 5.5.2.  Abstaining from Alcohol and Other Drugs.  Use of alcohol, medications, or narcotics can  cause  drowsiness,  dull  the  senses,  effect  the  central  nervous  system  and  cause  other detrimental  physical,  emotional  or  mental  responses  which  impair  an  operator’s  judgement and reaction time. 5.5.2.1.  No operator will be under the influence of alcohol or narcotics while operating a vehicle.    (T-0).    Operators  will  not  consume  alcohol  8  hours  prior  to  duty  or  prior  to operating  any  GMVs.    (T-0).    Operators  are  ultimately  responsible  for  exercising  good judgment by imposing additional time constraints as needed. 5.5.2.2.  Medication.    When  uncertain  about  the  effects  of  a  particular  pharmaceutical drug/medicine  (over-the-counter  or  prescription);  before  taking,  check  with  your prescribing doctor or pharmacist.  If he/she says that it may cause drowsiness, do not take it before driving. 5.5.3.  Adequate  Rest.    Operators  work/rest  cycle  will  be  monitored  and  must  be  in compliance  with  DoDI  6055.4.    (T-0).    It  is  the  operator’s  responsibility  to  inform  his/her supervisor if they have not had adequate sleep, and feel his/her driving will be unsafe.  (T-1). Section 5D—Elements of Safe Driving 5.6.  Daily Driving Practices.  During daily driving, following these routine general practices: 5.6.1.  Always sit in an erect, comfortable position with shoulders parallel to the back of the operator’s seat.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 53 5.6.2.  Adjust the seat, if necessary, to easily manipulate the vehicle controls and have a clear view to the front. 5.6.3.  Adjust side and rearview mirrors for unobstructed views. 5.6.4.  Fasten shoulder and seat belts. 5.6.5.  Lock doors, if applicable. 5.7.  Driving  on  the  Correct  Side  of  the  Road.  On  two-lane  roads,  follow  local  law  for guidance  on  operating  a  GMV  on  the  correct  side  of  the  road.    Local  law  will  require  the operator  to  operate  the  GMV  either  on  the  left-hand  or  right-hand  side  of  the  road.    (T-0).  Driving on the opposite side of the road is permitted only in certain situations (such as passing). 5.8.  Effect of Physical Laws.  Operators should be aware that it is impossible to drive properly and  safely  without  recognizing  such  natural  forces  as  gravity,  friction,  centrifugal  force,  and kinetic  energy.    These  natural  forces  impact  the  speed,  stopping  ability,  direction  control  and overall stability of a vehicle. 5.9.  Speed  Control.  All  operators  of  GMVs  will  adhere  to  posted  speed  limits,  governed  by military regulation and civilian laws, when driving, unless hazards or conditions require a speed lower than the posted speed.   (T-0).  Driving at  a high rate of speed is more likely to  cause an accident than any other driving infraction. 5.10.  Wheel  Control.  An operator should be ready at all times for a complete, controlled turn of the wheel in a fraction of a second.  Therefore, the position of the hands on the steering wheel is especially important for vehicle control, particularly in emergencies.  To have more control of the wheel, follow these general practices: 5.10.1.  Hold the steering wheel by the rim of the wheel, not the spokes. 5.10.2.  Hold the steering wheel with fingers and thumbs. 5.10.3.  Maintain a firm, but comfortable grip. 5.10.4.  Remove  hands  from  the  wheel  only  when  signaling,  adjusting  controls,  or performing other acts essential to driving. 5.11.  Using  Selective  Vision.  Safe  operators  are  completely  aware  of  their  surroundings,  and have scanned the area ahead in order to react quickly to any potential hazards.  A good operator looks ahead to the distance within 12 to 15 seconds in order to identify: 5.11.1.  Turning vehicles or those entering the highway. 5.11.2.  Brake lights from slow moving vehicles. 5.11.3.  Hills, curves, or anything that might require slowing down or changing lanes. 5.11.4.  Paying attention to traffic signals and signs. 5.11.5.  Traffic signs which warn of road conditions where a change in speed is necessary. 5.12.  Starting:  Instructions  on  starting  manual  and  automatic  shift  vehicles  are  found  in  this chapter.  However, the following points are given on specific starting conditions: 5.12.1.  On Hills:  When starting a vehicle on an upgrade, engage the parking brake to keep the vehicle from rolling backward.  Keep the parking brake on while shifting into low gear  54 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 and  begin  to  release  the  clutch  pedal  slowly.    When  the  vehicle  begins  to  pull  against  the brake,  release  the  brake  slowly.    This  allows  the  operator  to  start  the  vehicle  without  the danger  of  rolling  back  and  losing  control.    Although  it  may  not  be  necessary  to  use  the parking  brake  in  vehicles  equipped  with  automatic  transmission  or  special  devices  that prevent rolling back on hills, it is a safety precaution that an operator should take. 5.12.2.  Slippery Surfaces.  When starting a vehicle on a slippery surface (such as ice, sand, loose  dirt,  or  so  forth)  use  second  or  a  higher  gear  instead  of  low  gear.    Feed  the  gas  and release the clutch pedal very slowly to avoid spinning the rear wheels (manual transmission only). Section 5E—General Compression Ignition Engines (Diesel) Operating Principle and Procedures 5.13.  Diesel Fuel Engines Overview.  Conventional gasoline-fueled and spark ignition engines differ  in  their  principles  of  operation.    Before-,  starting-,  and  during-operation  procedures  also differ for conventional and diesel  engines.   This  chapter provides information on the operating principals and procedures for compression ignition engines. 5.14.  Operating  Principles  for  Diesel  Fuel  Engines.  Diesel  fuel  engines  in  most  tactical wheeled  vehicles  use  Jet-A  (continental  United  States  (CONUS))  and  JP-8  (outside  the continental  United  States  (OCONUS)).    Filters  on  both  series  of  diesel  fuel  engine  tactical wheeled vehicles require daily maintenance. 5.14.1.  During-Operation  Procedures  for  Diesel  Fuel  Engines.    Operators  converting  from vehicles  powered  by  conventional  spark  ignition  gasoline  engines  to  vehicles  powered  by compression ignition engines should become thoroughly familiar with the before-, starting-, and during-operation procedures required by compression ignition engines (Diesel).  Consult the  vehicle  Manufacturer’s  Operator’s  Manual  and  respective  lesson  plan  written  for  that vehicle before trying to start or operate the vehicle. 5.14.1.1.  Do not idle the engine of a parked vehicle except  when necessary to keep the engine  warm  in  extremely  cold  weather.    For  more  information,  see  the  Installation’s Idling  Policy.    Note:    Warning,  keep  windows,  curtains,  and  tarps  open  to  prevent dangerous accumulation of carbon monoxide inside vehicle while the engine is idling. 5.14.1.2.  Never  allow  the  vehicle  idle  for  long  periods  of  time.    In  addition  to  wasting fuel, excess idling allows carbon formation and oil dilution to take place in the engine. 5.14.1.2.1.  Cold  weather  bases  may  allow  unattended  vehicles  to  remain  idling during extreme cold weather, as approved by competent authority.  Unit commanders will  establish  procedures  that  have  been  coordinated  and  approved  by  installation health and safety officials.  (T-1). 5.14.1.2.2.  Operators will be familiar with these procedures prior to leaving a vehicle unattended.  (T-1).  See AFI 24-302 for information on the Air Force’s idling policy. 5.14.1.3.  Never  run  the  engine  to  recharge  a  rundown  battery  unless  specifically instructed to do so by an immediate supervisor. 5.14.1.4.  Never leave a vehicle unattended with the engine running.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 55 5.14.1.5.  Do  not  exceed  speeds  indicated  on  the  vehicle  data  plate  (if  applicable)  or operate at an engine speed low enough to cause the engine to labor. Vehicle instruction plates are usually located on the instrument panel. Section 5F—Manual, Semiautomatic, and Automatic Transmissions Operation 5.15.  General  Information.  An  operator  of  GMVs  should  be  prepared  to  drive  vehicles  with either  manual,  semiautomatic,  or  automatic  transmissions.    Each  transmission  type  requires specific methods to ensure smooth operation. 5.16.  Clutch  Operation:  A  clutch  provides  the  means  to  apply  engine  power  to  the  wheels smoothly  and  gradually.    The  operator  must  learn  the  following:    Where  the  clutch  starts  to engage,  how  far  the  pedal  moves  to  become  fully  engaged,  how  much  free  play  the  pedal  has, how fast they should engage the clutch.  (T-1). 5.16.1.  The  GMV  operator’s  foot  should  not  be  on  the  clutch  pedal  except  when  actually starting,  stopping,  or  shifting  gears.    Even  a  slight  constant  pressure  on  the  clutch  pedal causes excessive wear.  For this reason, when stopped on a hill, never slip the clutch to keep from rolling backward; instead use the brakes.  While waiting in a long line at traffic lights or when halted for other reasons,  press the  clutch pedal  and  move the transmission shift  lever into neutral.  Release the clutch after shifting into neutral. 5.16.2.  When slowing a vehicle in order to stop or to turn, reduce the speed to 15 mph or less before  pressing  the  clutch  pedal.    Coasting  a  vehicle  at  a  high-speed  with  the  clutch  pedal pressed  is  dangerous.    Vehicle  control  becomes  more  difficult  and  the  clutch  may  be damaged.  Damage resulting from this practice is considered vehicle abuse. 5.17.  Manual Shifting Purpose. 5.17.1.  Skill  in  manual  shifting  is  a  requirement  of  good  driving.    Poor  manual  shifting results in poor vehicle performance and can damage the vehicle.  The operator of the GMV should be so familiar with the gearshift lever positions that they can shift to any gear without looking at the shift lever. 5.17.2.  The gearshift pattern is usually diagramed on the vehicle caution plate.  Never move the gearshift lever from one position to another while the engine is running (until the clutch pedal has been fully pressed with the left foot). 5.17.3.  To shift  gears smoothly  and quietly, keep the pedal  fully pressed until  the shift has been completed. 5.17.4.  When shifting gears in a 1 ½-ton or larger truck, the operator may be required to use the double-clutching instructions. 5.17.5.  When  shifting  gears  in  rough  terrain  and  on  hills,  always  maintain  positive momentum in order to avoid causing the engine to labor or jerk before shifting into a lower gear ratio.  Always anticipate the need for extra power and shift gears accordingly. 5.17.6.  When descending a hill, with or without a heavy cargo, always drive with the vehicle in gear and the clutch pedal out.  56 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 5.18.  Clutch  Shifting  Procedure:  After  becoming  acquainted  with  the  vehicle’s  instruments and controls, the operator is ready to begin driving operations.  Start and warm the engine with the  transmission  in  neutral.    Perform  the  following  steps  to  start  moving  the  vehicle  in  low  or first gear: 5.18.1.  Press the clutch pedal and shift into low gear. 5.18.2.  Check the inside and outside rearview mirrors. 5.18.3.  Check blind spots. 5.18.4.  Let the clutch pedal up slowly, pausing at friction point or when the clutch feels like it is taking hold.  Hesitate; then check mirrors again for traffic. 5.18.5.  Release the parking brake. 5.18.6.  Slowly release the clutch pedal and at the same time slightly press the accelerator. 5.18.7.  When  driving  operation  is  underway,  the  left  foot  should  be  completely  removed from the clutch pedal. 5.19.  Double-Clutch  Shifting  Procedure:  Good driving practice in trucks (1 ½-ton or larger) often requires the operator to double-clutch to properly engage the gears and to prevent loss of momentum.  Do the following to shift to a lower gear by double-clutching: 5.19.1.  Release pressure from the accelerator and begin pressing the clutch pedal. 5.19.2.  When  the  clutch  pedal  is  fully  pressed,  move  the  gearshift  lever  to  the  neutral position. 5.19.3.  Release the clutch pedal  and at the same  time press  the accelerator to  speed up the engine. 5.19.4.  Let up on the accelerator and press the clutch pedal. 5.19.5.  While  the  clutch  pedal  is  pressed,  move  the  gearshift  lever  to  the  next  lower  gear speed. 5.19.6.  Release  the  clutch  pedal  and  at  the  same  time  press  the  accelerator  to  maintain engine speed as the load is again connected to the engine. 5.19.7.  The procedure is the same for shifting to a higher gear speed, except that the engine is not accelerated while the gear is in neutral. 5.20.  Spark  Ignition  Engine  Braking  Operation:  If the hill is steep enough to require using brakes to reduce speed, shift into the next lower gear at the crest of the hill and use the engine compression  as  a  brake.    The  following  process  applies  to  spark  ignition  engines  only.  Compression  ignition  (multi-fuel/diesel)  engines  should  not  be  used  to  reduce  speed,  or  the operator can damage the engine. 5.20.1.  Take extreme care to prevent excessive engine speed while descending a hill.  Judge the necessary gear and shift, if necessary, at the crest of the hill before speed has increased from downhill movement. 5.20.2.  Ordinarily, the gear required to ascend a hill is proper to use to descend it.  Gearing down  after  engine  speed  has  increased  may  extensively  damage  the  engine.    Except  when used  to  compensate  for  brake  failure,  damage  resulting  from  this  practice  is  considered  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 57 vehicle abuse.  With proper gear selection, intermittent application of brakes can reduce the speed of the vehicle to safe limits. 5.20.3.  The operator of a GMV, when preparing to stop the vehicle, should remove his/her foot from the accelerator and use the engine compression as a brake to help stop the vehicle. 5.20.4.  Do  not  press  the  clutch  pedal  until  the  motor  is  operating  at  low  speed  and  is  no longer serving as a brake.  Then press the clutch pedal before the engine begins to labor from slow speed.  Apply the foot brake to help this braking action. 5.20.5.  When preparing to turn or stop, avoid downshifting above 20 mph. Note:  Caution, braking on icy roads requires a special technique that is discussed in Chapter 8. 5.20.6.  The above rules apply to most vehicles.  To meet the military’s transportation needs for  moving  heavy  equipment  and  traveling  over  rough  terrain,  new  vehicles  are  constantly being developed.  These vehicles may have more complicated transmissions (such as multi-gear  ranges  and  dual-speed  axles  or  other  special  features).    To  understand  how  a  new vehicle may operate, read the Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual and respective lesson plan written for that vehicle before attempting to operate it. Section 5G—Automatic Transmission Operation 5.21.  General  Information.  While  some  military  vehicles  are  equipped  with  manual transmissions,  an  increasing  number  are  equipped  with  automatic  transmissions.    Though operation  of  automatic  shift  vehicles  is  quite  simple,  the  operator  should  learn  to  operate  them smoothly and properly. 5.22.  Selector  Lever  Positions  :    In  vehicles  equipped  with  automatic  transmissions,  initial gear selection is controlled with a selector lever.  When in drive (D or DR), shifting from drive to low  (L)  and  returning  to  drive  is  controlled  automatically  by  engine  speed.    Since  there  are  a number  of  different  automatic  transmissions,  the  operator  must  become  acquainted  with  the vehicle and learn the selector lever positions.  (T-1). 5.22.1.  The selector lever positions are as follows: 5.22.1.1.  P (Park position) is used to lock the transmission so the vehicle (light vehicles such as sedans and pickups) cannot roll while parked.  In some heavier vehicles, the park position does not lock the transmission.  In vehicles with a park position, start the engine from the park position. 5.22.1.2.  N (Neutral position) is used to start engines of vehicles without a park position.  In the neutral position, the engine is disengaged from the drive shaft of the vehicle. 5.22.1.3.  D or DR (Drive position) is used to move the vehicle forward.  With the shift lever at D or DR, the vehicle moves forward as the accelerator is pressed.  After starting the  engine  in  the  neutral  or  park  position,  change  the  selector  to  D  or  DR  to  move forward.    To  avoid  premature  forward  movement,  apply  the  brake  while  in  the  drive position until ready to move the vehicle.  The transmission automatically shifts to higher gears as the speed increases. 5.22.1.4.  L (LOW or power position) is used to negotiate steep grades and rough terrain or  when  the  braking  power  of  the  engine  is  required.    The  transmission  cannot  shift  58 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 automatically to higher gear ratios when the lever is in the low position.  When the low range is no longer needed, release the accelerator temporarily and move the shift lever to the  drive  position  for  normal  gear  progression.    In  the  drive  position,  the  low  range  is engaged automatically when the engine speed is  reduced.  If the accelerator is suddenly fully pressed when the vehicle is in the drive position, the low range becomes engaged.  This  procedure  may  be  used  to  provide  a  sudden  burst  of  speed  for  passing.    When  a predetermined engine speed has been attained, the transmission automatically returns to driving range. 5.22.1.5.  R (Reverse position) is used to move the vehicle in reverse.  Some shift levers require raising the lever slightly before moving to the reverse position.  Others require the operator  to  press  a  button  on  the  end  of  the  lever  before  moving  to  R.    Park  vehicles without a park position in the reverse position by bring the vehicle to a full halt, placing it in R; and then setting the parking brake. 5.22.2.  A  good  operator,  before  driving  a  vehicle,  becomes  thoroughly  familiar  with  the vehicle instruments and controls.  The operator checks the selector positions before moving the lever.  Serious accidents can occur if these rules are not followed. 5.22.3.  A  good  operator  may  shift  from  D  or  DR  according  to  driving  needs.    Never  shift from  D  or  DR  to  L  at  a  high  rate  of  speed  because  this  could  seriously  damage  the transmission  and  could  result  in  a  severe  accident  by  causing  a  skid  on  wet  or  slippery pavement. 5.23.  Dual-Range  Driving  Positions.  Tactical  vehicles  may  be  equipped  with  automatic transmissions.    Due  to  the  diverse  conditions  under  which  they  may  be  required  to  operate, tactical  vehicle  automatic  transmissions  are  designed  for  greater  flexibility  than  commercial types.  Flexibility is attained with low and high transmission ranges.  Consult the Manufacturer’s Operator’s  Manual,  TO  and/or  respective  lesson  plan  for  instructions  on  how  to  operate  that vehicle. 5.23.1.  Vehicles equipped with dual-range driving positions offer the operator a selection of two ranges in driving pattern D or DR.  Use them according to driving needs as prescribed below.  On some vehicles, these positions are F1 and F2. 5.23.1.1.  D (F1) position is used for all ordinary driving.  It does the following: 5.23.1.1.1.  Provides four forward speeds. 5.23.1.1.2.  Shifts automatically to fourth gear. 5.23.1.1.3.  Increases economy by reducing engine speed. 5.23.1.2.  DR  (F2)  position  is  used  for  congested  areas,  rough  terrain,  and  mountain driving.  It does the following: 5.23.1.2.1.  Provides three forward speeds automatically. 5.23.1.2.2.  Cannot shift into fourth gear unless the engine is accelerated to very high revolutions per minute (RPM). 5.23.1.2.3.  Uses the engine as a brake on long, steep downgrades. 5.24.  Operating Procedure:  To put the vehicle in motion, do the following:  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 59 5.24.1.  Apply the foot brake. 5.24.2.  Select the proper transmission lever position (forward or reverse). 5.24.3.  Place the transfer shift lever in the appropriate range. 5.24.4.  Check traffic conditions front and rear, using mirrors if necessary. 5.24.5.  Release the parking brake. 5.24.6.  Check  again  for  traffic  blind  spots  to  the  left  or  right  rear.    Signal  if  pulling  away from a curb. 5.24.7.  Release the foot brake. 5.24.8.  Press the accelerator pedal gradually for a smooth start. 5.24.9.  GMV  operators  are  not  permitted  to  tow  or  push  automatic  shift  vehicles  for  the purpose of starting them. 5.24.9.1.  During normal duty hours, contact Vehicle Management Customer Service  to start the vehicle with a booster battery, jumper cables, or other equipment. 5.24.9.2.  After duty hours, contact Vehicle Operations for wrecker service. Section 5H—Steering and Turning 5.25.  Steering Wheel Position.  The best and safest position of the hands on the steering wheel is  one  hand  on  each  side  of  the  wheel  a  little  below  the  center  (the  8  o’clock  and  4  o'clock position).  Two hands are necessary for beginners and for experienced operators.  The grip on the wheel should be firm, but not tight. 5.26.  Handling  Curves.  Many  accidents  occur  on  a  curve  when  an  operator  (who  is  usually driving too fast) loses control of his/her vehicle and skids off the road.  To make a vehicle follow a curved path, force should be used to overcome its natural tendency to go straight.  At 60 mph, it takes nine times as much force to keep a vehicle turning as it does at 20 mph. 5.26.1.  Effective steering depends on the traction between the road and the tires.  The part of each tire in contact with the road at any one time is only about the size of the sole of a shoe.  Whenever the tendency of the vehicle to travel in a straight line becomes too powerful for the traction holding the vehicle on the curve, the tires slide on the road and the vehicle starts to skid  and  the  operator  can  lose  control  of  the  vehicle.    When  navigating  a  curve,  do  the following: 5.26.1.1.  Approach  the  curve  slow  enough  to  enable  the  engine  to  continually  pull  and maintain speed throughout the curve. 5.26.1.2.  Do  not  wait  until  in  the  curve  to  apply  the  brakes.    If  the  brakes  have  to  be applied  in  a  curve,  be  careful.    Use  a  gentle  pumping  motion  until  it  is  safe  to  keep continuous pressure on the pedal. 5.26.1.3.  Start turning the wheels just before the point at which the road begins to turn. 5.26.1.4.  Once  in  a  curve,  stay  to  the  right  of  the  centerline  and  stay  as  close  to  the shoulder  as  possible.    Do  not  cut  into  the  lane  of  oncoming  traffic  to  make  the  curve easier.  60 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 5.26.1.5.  Maintaining  a  moderate  speed  can  make  the  curve  easier  to  handle  from  the correct lane. 5.26.1.6.  If driving a vehicle with  a manual  transmission, do not  engage  the clutch and “free  wheel”  into  or  around  a  curve.    This  may  actually  cause  the  vehicle  speed  to increase  causing  an  out  of  control  situation.    Use  of  vehicle  engine  speed  to  control vehicle speed is important in maintaining control with this type of vehicle. 5.26.1.7.  An upcoming  curve  cannot  be judged  by the previous curve.   Always assume that an unfamiliar curve is sharp. 5.27.  Turning.  When  turning  a  corner  or  making  any  other  sharp  turn,  use  the  hand-to-hand steering method (see  Figure 5.1.).  If turning to the right, begin by placing the right hand near the top of the wheel and pull the wheel down to the right.  As the right hand nears the bottom of the circle, let the left hand take over, starting at a position on the left of the wheel, a little below the top.  As the left hand nears the bottom of the circle, again place the right hand at the top of the wheel to continue the turn, if necessary.  When the turn is complete, release pressure on the steering  wheel  and  the  wheels  should  return  to  their  normal  straightforward  position straightening the vehicle. Figure 5.1.  Hand-to-Hand Steering Method. 5.28.  Turning  Left.  Before  making  any  turn,  always  signal  at  least  100  feet  before  the intersection.    When  making  a  left  turn,  ensure  that  traffic  approaching  from  the  right  is  visible and that there is enough space to turn left.  Do the following when turning left (see also  Figure 5.2.):  5.28.1.  Signal the intent to turn and slow down. 5.28.2.  Start the turn only after the vehicle's rear clears the centerline. 5.28.3.  Be sure there is adequate distance to turn in front of traffic. 5.28.4.  Watch the vehicle's progress in the side mirrors. 5.28.5.  Steer the vehicle wide of the lane, if necessary. 5.28.6.  When the vehicle's  wheels  are into the lane, steer left to  put  the vehicle in  the lane and straighten up. 5.28.7.  Always watch for oncoming traffic.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 61 5.28.8.  Turn into the left lane when making a left turn. 5.28.9.  To turn left on multi-lane streets and highways, start from the left lane. 5.28.10.  If  turning  onto  a  highway,  which  has  more  than  one  lane  in  the  direction  to  be travelled, turn into the closest lane going in that direction. 5.28.11.  After the left turn is completed, cancel the signal. 5.28.12.  If changing to another lane, wait until the turn has been completed safely. Figure 5.2.  Making a Left Hand Turn.  5.29.  Turning Right.  Do the following when turning right (see also Figure 5.3.): 5.29.1.  Ensure there is enough space to turn right. 5.29.2.  Signal the intent to turn and slow down gradually when approaching the turn. 5.29.3.  Be sure to let oncoming traffic clear before making the turn. 5.29.4.  Stay as close to the right edge of the road or street as possible. 5.29.5.  Never swerve to the left before turning right. 5.29.6.  Position the vehicle in the right-hand lane.  Keep the vehicle's rear close to the curb.  Do not turn wide to the left when starting the turn; a driver to the rear may assume a left turn is being made. 5.29.7.  Pull  forward  into  the  intersection  past  the  right  corner,  ensuring  the  vehicle’s  rear clears the curb. 5.29.8.  Check the vehicle's progress using the right side mirrors. 5.29.9.  Turn into the right lane when making a right turn. 5.29.10.  To turn right on multi-lane streets and highways, start from the right lane. 5.29.11.  If it is necessary to swerve into the left lane or to enter the lane of oncoming traffic, be watchful for oncoming cars. 5.29.12.  After the right turn is completed, cancel the signal.  62 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 5.29.13.  If changing to another lane, wait until the turn has been completed safely. 5.29.14.  If the vehicle is traveling at the correct rate of speed, a right or left turn should be made  without  swerving.    If  the  tires  squeal  when  turning,  it  is  likely  that  the  vehicle  is traveling at a rate of speed that is unsafe to make the turn. Figure 5.3.  Making Right Hand Turn. Section 5I—Managing Space and Safe Distances  5.30.  Managing Space and Safe Distances.  A safe operator should position his/her vehicle to ensure  that  there  is  ample  space  surrounding  it,  and  keep  enough  distance  between  his/her vehicle and vehicles ahead.  This space and distance can give the operator time to think and act if something goes wrong.  It is especially important for those operators operating large vehicles. 5.30.1.  The  area  ahead  of  the  vehicle  is  most  important;  in  case  a  sudden  stop  is  required.  An  operator  who  tailgates,  does  not  allow  enough  time  or  distance  to  handle  emergency situations.    Rear-end  collisions  often  occur  because  an  operator  has  not  allowed  for  a  safe following/stopping  distance  between  his/her  vehicle  and  the  vehicle  in  front  of  them.  Remember, a smaller vehicle can stop faster than a larger vehicle. 5.30.2.  When determining how much space should be kept in front of the vehicle, provide at least 1 second for each 10 feet of vehicle length at speeds below 40 mph.  At greater speeds, add 1 second for safety. 5.30.2.1.  For  example,  the  operator  of  a  40-foot  vehicle  traveling  at  a  speed  below  40 MPH should leave 4 seconds between himself/herself and the vehicle ahead.   If the 40-foot vehicle is moving faster than 40 mph, at least 5 seconds would be needed. 5.30.2.2.  Remember, when weather conditions have affected road conditions, more time and space is required to stop.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 63 5.30.3.  Specific  following  distances  are  determined  for  certain  vehicles.    GMV  operators violating the distance below can be prosecuted IAW federal and state law.: 5.30.3.1.  When driving outside of cities and towns, a bus or truck will not travel closer than 200 feet behind another bus or truck.  (T-0). 5.30.3.2.  When  a  fire  engine  is  answering  an  alarm,  the  minimum  safe  following distance will be 500 feet.  (T-0). 5.31.  Changing  Lanes.  When  changing  lanes:    Do  not  turn  sharply  (use  light  pressure  on  the steering wheel), give a turn signal in the direction you are changing lanes and look for traffic that may be approaching from the rear or vehicles in the vehicle’s blind spot. Section 5J—Passing 5.32.  Safe Passing.  To safely pass, the GMV operator should know:  when to pass, when not to pass, and how to pass.  It is generally a good idea to pass at a speed at least 10 to 15 mph faster than the speed of the vehicle being passed, unless the posted speed limit would be exceeded.  If the posted speed limit would be exceeded, the GMV operator will not pass.  (T-0). 5.32.1.  When passing, operators will look ahead and behind to be sure it is safe to pass.  (T-0). 5.32.2.  GMV  operators  will  alert  the  operators  in  the  vehicles  ahead  and  to  the  rear  of  the intention to pass using turn signals.  (T-0). 5.32.3.  An operator cannot pass safely unless they can see far enough ahead to be sure that they can get back in line before they meet any traffic coming from the opposite direction. 5.32.4.  An operator will maintain a safe following distance and clearance between vehicles.  (T-0).  In most localities, a minimum of two feet of  clearance is required between the right side of their vehicle and the left side of the vehicle being passed. 5.32.5.  Passing is not complete until the operator of the passing vehicle has returned safely to their side of the road or into the correct lane of travel. 5.32.5.1.  If the operator of the vehicle being passed is forced to slow down as the passing vehicle returns to the lane of traffic, the other operator has not passed safely.  Generally, it is safe to return to the right side of the road when the passed vehicle can be seen in the rearview mirror. 5.32.6.  As a  general  rule, do not  attempt to  pass more than one vehicle  at  a time.  Passing several vehicles increases the danger because it increases the time spent and distance covered while out of the traffic lane. 5.33.  Unsafe  Passing.  The  following  are  some  situations  where  passing  is  always  dangerous and/or unlawful: 5.33.1.  On any curve or hill where visibility is less than 500 feet ahead. 5.33.2.  At intersections and railway crossings. 5.33.3.  Whenever there is a single or double solid line between lanes or when operator’s side lane of a double line is solid.  64 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 5.33.4.  At crosswalks where a vehicle has stopped to allow a pedestrian to cross (see Figure 5.4.). 5.33.5.  When a school bus is stopped to load or unload passengers on a public road (unless a physical barrier or unpaved median separates traffic going in either direction) or on a private road. 5.33.6.  Whenever visibility is limited and it is impossible to see if the road is free of traffic far enough ahead to pass safely. Figure 5.4.  Proper Stopping Places at Crosswalks.  5.34.  Passing on the Right.  Passing on the right can be dangerous and unlawful.  The passing operator  must  avoid  being  in  the  other  operator’s  blind  spot,  and  must  be  aware  that  the  other operator may be intending to move to the right.   (T-0).  There are, however, three situations in which passing on the right are permissible and reasonably safe: 5.34.1.  If the highway has at least two lanes going in each direction. 5.34.2.  If all lanes of traffic move in the same direction (one-way street). 5.34.3.  If the vehicle that is being passed is in a left-turn lane. 5.35.  Passing  on  Three-Lane  Highways.  Passing  on  a  three-lane  highway  demands  extra caution.    The  center  lane  may  be  marked  open  for  passing  in  both  directions.    Before  passing, make sure that none of the vehicles coming from the opposite direction are moving out to pass.  NEVER use the center lane to pass if the view of the road ahead is obstructed by a hill or curve. 5.36.  Being Passed.  When being passed, the law requires that the operator of the vehicle being passed, help the driver of the passing vehicle to pass safely. 5.36.1.  When  the  operator  of  the  passing  vehicle  signals  the  intention  to  pass,  the  operator being passed must give way to the right.  (T-0).  Even if the vehicle being passed is on their side of the road, they should move over as close (as safety should permit) to the right-hand edge of the road. 5.36.2.  The operator being passed should not increase his/her speed.  This action forces the passing driver to cover more distance and take more time to pass.  It potentially exposes all drivers in the immediate vicinity to unnecessary danger.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 65 5.36.3.  When  being  passed,  maintain  a  steady  speed.    This  allows  the  passing  operator  to judge  the  passing  distance  with  greater  accuracy.    However,  if  an  attempt  to  pass  becomes dangerous, slowing down and allowing the passing vehicle to get back into the proper lane in the least amount of time and distance may be safest for everyone concerned. Section 5K—Intersections 5.37.  Intersections.  The  most  dangerous  place  on  a  street  or  highway  is  an  intersection.    An intersection is any place where two or more roads join or cross each other.  Whether an operator has the right-of-way or not, they will slow down when approaching all intersections.  (T-0).  The following rules of the road are standard; however, state and local laws take precedence. 5.37.1.  Intersections Without Traffic Controls. 5.37.1.1.  When  approaching  a  primary  road  from  a  secondary  road,  the  operator approaching the primary road must yield to traffic on that road.  (T-0).  When entering an intersection  with  traffic,  an  operator  must  yield  to  that  traffic  regardless  of  the  type  of road.  (T-0). 5.37.1.2.  For jurisdictions where operators are required to operate the GMV on the right-side  of  the  road,  except  when  local  law  states  otherwise  (e.g.,  when  passing),  the  law states  that  when  two  vehicles  enter  an  intersection  from  different  highways  at  the  same time, the operator on the left must yield to the operator on the right.  (T-0). 5.37.1.3.  For jurisdictions where operators are required to operate the GMV on the left-side  of  the  road,  except  when  local  law  states  otherwise,  the  law  states  that  when  two vehicles enter an intersection from different highways at the same time, the operator on the right must yield to the operator on the left.  (T-0). 5.37.1.4.  The  law  does  not  give  right  (left)-of-way  to  anyone;  it  only  states  who  must yield  it.    (T-0).    Therefore,  always  be  alert  for  those  who  fail  to  yield  to  avoid  an accident. 5.37.2.  Intersections with Traffic Controls. 5.37.2.1.  Traffic Lights. 5.37.2.1.1.  Traffic  lights  greatly  simplify  right-of-way  uncertainty,  however  rules still may vary from state-to-state.  At some intersections, a left turn may only be made when  a  special  left-turn  green  light  is  showing,  often  the  sign  is  in  the  form  of  a traffic light showing a green arrow. 5.37.2.1.2.  At  other  intersections  where  there  are  signs  permitting,  a  right  turn  may be  made  on  a  red  light.    To  turn  right  on  a  red  light  at  one  of  these  intersections requires the operator to be in the right-turn lane and to give a right-turn signal. 5.37.2.2.  Traffic Signs. 5.37.2.2.1.  A  stop  sign  at  an  intersection  signifies  that  an  operator  must  come  to  a complete  stop.    (T-0).    An  operator  will  not  enter  the  intersection,  whether  to  go straight through or to turn right or left, until the movement can be made safely.  (T-0).  66 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 5.37.2.2.2.  At intersections governed by yield signs, an operator will slow down to a speed reasonable for the conditions and yield the right-of-way.  (T-0). 5.37.2.2.3.  When required to stop at an intersection where a line has been painted on the street indicating the place to stop, stop before the line.  When the place to stop is not  marked,  stop  close  enough  to  the  intersection  so  that  any  approaching  traffic  is visible.  Do not start again until the way is clear.  Do not enter the intersection if there is  traffic  on  the  intersecting  street  that  will  reach  the  intersection  before  having cleared it.  (T-0). 5.37.2.2.4.  Do  not  block  a  crosswalk.    Pedestrians  crossing  at  an  intersection  will have the right-of-way over vehicles.  (T-0). 5.37.2.2.5.  At  some  intersections,  both,  traffic  lights  and  traffic  signs  are  present.  GMV  operators  must  obey  traffic  lights  over  traffic  signs  when  the  lights  are  in operation.    (T-0).    Also,  as  previously  mentioned,  a  traffic  officer’s  signal  must  be obeyed regardless of traffic lights or signs.  (T-0). Section 5L—Special Intersections 5.38.  Special  Intersections.  On  new  highways,  an  increasing  number  of  intersections  are designed so that one road passes over the other instead of crossing it.  To turn right or left at such intersections, it is necessary to use connecting roads to get onto the crossroads.  Also, the method of making turns may vary from one to the other.  Whenever approaching an intersection where one road passes over or under the other, slow down and pay attention to the signs that tell how to make the desired turn. 5.38.1.  Cloverleaf Intersection.  The most common intersections where the roads cross each other at  different  levels,  is  the cloverleaf intersection (see  Figure  5.5.).   The advantages of the cloverleaf design and similar intersections are that the operator does not have to cross the path of other traffic to make a turn. 5.38.1.1.  For jurisdictions where operators are required to operate the GMV on the right-side  of  the  road,  except  when  local  law  states  otherwise  (e.g.,  when  passing),  to  turn right, take a right turn before getting to the bridge that carries one road over the other.  To turn left, take the right turn just after the bridge.  This road joins the crossroad in a three-quarter circle at an ordinary intersection. 5.38.1.2.  For jurisdictions where operators are required to operate the GMV on the left-side of the road, except when local law states otherwise (e.g., when passing), to turn left, take a left turn before getting to the bridge that carries one road over the other.  To turn right,  take  the  right  turn  just  after  the  bridge.    This  road  joins  the  crossroad  in  a  three-quarter circle at an ordinary intersection.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 67 Figure 5.5.  A Cloverleaf Intersection.  5.38.2.  Roundabouts/Traffic  Circles.    Some  traffic  circles  have  one  lane,  some  have  two lanes,  and  some  have  even  more.    Observe  all  posted  lane  signs  before  entering  the  traffic circle.    Upon  entering  a  traffic  circle,  all  vehicles  travel  in  the  same  direction.    Simply continue around the circle in a counterclockwise direction until reaching the desired road or street. 5.38.2.1.  For jurisdictions where operators are required to operate the GMV on the right-side of the road, except when local law states otherwise, leave the traffic circle by making a right turn. 5.38.2.2.  For jurisdictions where operators are required to operate the GMV on the left-side of the road, except when local law states otherwise, leave the traffic circle by making a left turn. 5.38.2.3.  When traveling around the circle, use the inside lane if practicable.  Be sure to get in the outside lane well before coming to the intended exit.  Never attempt to make a right turn from the inside lane.  Look and signal before turning or changing lanes. 5.38.2.4.  At traffic circles, the whole circle is  considered  an intersection.  The vehicles already in  the traffic circle will have the right-of-way over those approaching the  circle on the roads leading into it unless traffic signs indicate otherwise.  (T-0) 5.38.3.  Railroad Crossing.  To move safely through a railroad crossing: 5.38.3.1.  Identify all warning signs, signals, and protective devices. 5.38.3.2.  Look both ways and listen for approaching trains before crossing. 5.38.3.3.  After  a  train  has  passed,  be  sure  no  other  train  is  approaching  from  the  other direction before starting across. 5.38.3.4.  Never stop on railroad tracks. 5.38.3.5.  Do not rely on mechanical equipment (flashing lights) to be sure the way is safe to cross. 5.38.3.6.  Never take familiar crossings for granted or assume that no train is coming.  68 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 5.38.3.7.  Be  particularly  alert  for  trains  after  dark  when  gates  or  flashing  lights  do  not protect crossings. 5.38.3.8.  As  a  general  rule,  the  operator  will  stop  the  vehicle  between  15  and  50  feet from  a  railroad  crossing  when  transporting  HAZMAT  or  passengers  (in  a  vehicle designed  to  transport  16  or  more  persons  including  the  operator).    (T-0).    However, operators are responsible for knowing and following applicable state and country laws. 5.38.3.9.  When  driving  a  bus,  the  operator  will  open  the  passenger  side  door  to  see  or hear an approaching train.  (T-0). 5.38.3.10.  NEVER attempt to bypass a closed railroad crossing to “beat the train.” 5.38.4.  Private Driveways.  When coming out of a private driveway, the operator will yield the right-of-way to all vehicles on the street or highway being entered, and will stop for any pedestrians,  bicyclists,  and  animals  that  may  be  on  the  sidewalk  or  about  to  cross  the driveway.  (T-0). Section 5M—Braking, Stopping and Allowable Distances 5.39.  Proper Braking.  The proper use of brakes is one of the most important elements of good driving as well as one of the best indicators of driving capability. 5.39.1.  Vehicle Weight and Braking.  The heavier a vehicle, the more work the brakes may do to stop it and the more heat they absorb.  The brakes, tires, springs, and shock absorbers on heavy vehicles are designed to work best when the vehicle is fully loaded.  Empty trucks require  greater  stopping  distances  because  they  have  less  traction  and  they  can  bounce  and lock up the wheels. 5.39.2.  General Procedures for Braking.  Use these general procedures for braking: 5.39.2.1.  Release the accelerator pedal. 5.39.2.2.  Downshift  within  the  operating  range  of  the  engine  rpm  (if  manual transmission). 5.39.2.3.  Press the brake pedal. 5.39.2.4.  As the vehicle begins to reduce speed, decrease brake pedal pressure. 5.39.2.5.  Stop  smoothly  by  releasing  the  brake  pressure  gradually  as  the  stopping  rate increases. 5.39.2.6.  As the vehicle stops, push in the clutch pedal (manual transmission) and release the brake pedal. 5.39.2.7.  After  stopping,  shift  to  neutral  and  reapply  the  brake  just  enough  to  keep  the vehicle stationary.  Now release the clutch pedal (manual transmission). 5.40.  Stopping.  The  following  factors  affect  an  operator’s  ability  to  bring  a  vehicle  to  a  stop:  Type and condition of road surface (such as concrete, asphalt, dirt, or gravel), foreign material on the road (such as ice, snow, rain, leaves, or mud), road configuration (such as uphill or downhill, straight,  curve, high crown, or dip), tire condition  (such as type and condition  of tread and tire inflation), and brakes (such as type and state-of-repair and adjustment).  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 69 5.41.  Allowable  Distances.  The  distance  required  to  stop  a  vehicle  in  an  emergency,  at  any speed, depends on the following:  Operator perception time, operator reaction time, and vehicle stop time. 5.41.1.  Stopping:  Perception Distance.  The time it takes the operator to recognize a hazard. 5.41.2.  Stopping:    Reaction  Distance.    The  distance  the  vehicle  travels  between  the  time  a problem is recognized and the time in which the brakes are applied. 5.41.3.  Stopping:    Braking  Distance.    The  distance  the  vehicle  travels  after  the  brakes  are applied. 5.41.3.1.  Stopping distance is affected by weather visibility and the mental and physical condition of the operator. 5.41.3.2.  Stopping  distance  is  also  affected  by  how  fast  the  vehicle  is  traveling,  the condition of its brakes and tires, and the pavement condition. Section 5N—Turning Around and Backing 5.42.  Turning Around.  The safest and often quickest way to turnaround is to drive around the block, making three right  turns and a final  left turn.   This  eliminates the  problems  of most left turns.  However, in some cases (such as a dead-end street or other tight space) the vehicle may have to be turned completely around.  Carefully follow these suggestions: 5.42.1.  Select a place where there is at least 500 feet of clear visibility in each direction. 5.42.2.  Do not attempt any turnaround near hills or curves or where visibility is limited. 5.42.3.  Be sure there are no signs prohibiting the turn. 5.42.4.  Be sure there is enough space to safely complete the turn. 5.42.5.  Check for vehicular and pedestrian traffic before and during the turn. 5.43.  Special  Turn  Maneuvers  (Avoid  in  Heavy  Traffic).  Remember that the responsibility for avoiding an accident rests with the operator.  Neither of the following turns should be made on roads with heavy traffic. 5.43.1.  U-turns.   U-turns are not  legal everywhere, so be sure to  look for prohibiting  signs before making one.  In cities and towns, U-turns are allowed at intersections only.  To make a U-turn, follow these steps (see also Figure 5.6.): 5.43.1.1.  Move into the proper lane.  On a two-lane street move as far right as possible.  On four-lane and divided streets, move into the left-turn lane. 5.43.1.2.  Check for traffic signal, stop, and then signal a left turn. 5.43.1.3.  Check  for  oncoming  traffic  and  for  room  to  complete  the  turn;  then  make  a sharp left turn. 5.43.1.4.  Slowly finish the turn, positioning the vehicle in the far right lane.  Straighten the wheels and proceed.  70 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Figure 5.6.  U-Turn.  5.43.2.  Road  Turns  (K-Turns/Three-Point  Turns).    If  a  U-turn  cannot  be  made  and  no  side road is available, use the road turn.  There are two ways of making a road turn: 5.43.2.1.  For jurisdictions where operators are required to operate the GMV on the right-side of the road, except when local law states otherwise: 5.43.2.1.1.  The easiest is to come to a complete stop at the right curb or edge of the road, using the shoulder  if available.   After  checking to  see that the  road is  clear of traffic in both directions, start turning to the left.  Turn the steering wheel as quickly as possible and as far to the left as it can go.  Just before getting to the opposite curb or  edge,  reverse  the  steering  wheel  as  far  to  the  right  as  it  can  go.    Now  back  up, keeping the steering wheel to the right.  As the vehicle approaches the opposite curb or edge, turn the steering wheel back again to the left.  By going forward and keeping the wheel to the left, now the vehicle should be clear of the curb or edge and the turn can  be  completed.    If  the  road  is  very  narrow,  the  above  steps  may  need  to  be repeated. 5.43.2.1.2.  A road turn can also be made by stopping close to the right curb or road edge and backing to the left.  Just before getting to the opposite curb or edge, turn the wheel hard to the right and then go forward.  When using this method, be careful to start far enough away from the right curb or edge so that the front wheels do not run into the curb or go off the road when starting to back to the left.  When making these turns, it is not necessary to reverse the steering wheel just before stopping.  This can be  done  after  the  vehicle  has  stopped.    However,  turning  the  wheels  while  still moving is easier and saves wear on the tires and steering mechanism. 5.43.2.2.  For jurisdictions where operators are required to operate the GMV on the left-side of the road, except when local law states otherwise: 5.43.2.2.1.  The  easiest  is  to  come  to  a  complete  stop  at  the left  curb  or  edge  of  the road, using the shoulder  if available.   After  checking to  see that the road is  clear of traffic in both directions, start turning to the right.  Turn the steering wheel as quickly as possible and as far to the right as it can go.  Just before getting to the opposite curb or  edge,  reverse  the  steering  wheel  as  far  to  the  left  as  it  can  go.    Now  back  up,  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 71 keeping the steering wheel to the left.  As the vehicle approaches the opposite curb or edge, turn the steering wheel back again to the right.  By going forward and keeping the wheel to the right, now the vehicle should be clear of the curb or edge and the turn can  be  completed.    If  the  road  is  very  narrow,  the  above  steps  may  need  to  be repeated. 5.43.2.2.2.  A  road  turn  can  also  be  made  by  stopping  close  to  the  left  curb  or  road edge and backing to the right.  Just before getting to the opposite curb or edge, turn the wheel hard to the left and then go forward.  When using this method, be careful to start far enough away from the left  curb or edge so that the front  wheels do not run into the curb or go off the road when starting to back to the right.  When making these turns, it is not necessary to reverse the steering wheel just before stopping.  This can be  done  after  the  vehicle  has  stopped.    However,  turning  the  wheels  while  still moving is easier and saves wear on the tires and steering mechanism. 5.43.3.  In business districts, where traffic is usually heavy, no method of turning around may be practical or safe.  In such places, the best way to reverse  direction is to drive around the block.  Use turn signals, four-way flashers, and if possible, a spotter. 5.44.  Backing.  To  turn  while  backing,  turn  the  steering  wheel  in  the  same  direction  as  if  the vehicle were moving forward.  To back to the right, turn the wheel to the right.  To back to the left, turn the wheel to the left, and back slowly.  In a vehicle with standard gears, speed cannot be safely  controlled  unless  the  clutch  is  used  with  the  accelerator.    Always  come  to  a  full  stop before shifting into forward gear. 5.44.1.  Before  backing  even  a  short  distance,  physically  walk-around  the  vehicle  to  ensure that there are no people or objects behind the vehicle. 5.44.2.  Never open either door while the vehicle is in motion except when going over frozen ice.  Backing is more dangerous than going forward.  Visibility is limited and the vehicle is harder to control. 5.44.3.  Never  back  long  distances,  unless  absolutely  necessary.    It  is  much  safer  to  turn around and cover the distance going forward. Section 5O—Spotter Safety 5.45.  Spotter  Safety.  Spotters  will  be  required  when  operator  visibility  is  obscured  or  in question,  when  backing  a  vehicle,  and  prior  to  beginning  aircraft  up/downloading  (with  pre-positioned  chock  in  place).    (T-1).    When  using  a  spotter,  the  following  guidance  will  be followed:  (T-1). 5.45.1.  The following safety items will be required for spotters during hours of darkness or periods of reduced visibility: reflective belt and flashlight or luminous wands.  (T-1). 5.45.2.  Spotters  must  be  trained  in  standard  hand  and  arm  signals  and  flashlight  signals before guiding a vehicle.  (T-0).  Hand and arm signals are the basic method used for ground guiding. 5.45.3.  Operators  and  spotters  must  coordinate  signals  before  vehicle  movement.    (T-0).  Voice signals between a spotter and operator can be misunderstood.  Therefore, they will not  72 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 be  used  except  in  an  emergency.    (T-1).    Standard  hand  and  arm  signals  for  spotters  are described later in the next section. 5.45.4.  The  number  of  spotters  used  is  determined  by  the  availability  of  personnel  and visibility restrictions (cargo, darkness, etc.).  In most cases only one spotter is required.  The spotter will be positioned so he/she will be seen by the operator at all times.  (T-1).  Figure 5.7.  shows  where  the  spotters  will  be  positioned  when  moving  vehicles  forward  and backwards.  (T-1). 5.45.5.  Spotters will never spot between the tires of an AT Forklift.  (T-1).  Spotters should maintain a minimum distance of 12 inches out from the front vehicle tire within the area of the forward rim. Figure 5.7.  Recommended Spotter Positions.  5.45.6.  In  the  event  that  more  than  one  spotter  is  required,  only  one  spotter  will  be designated as the primary spotter to give signals to the operator.  (T-1).  Everyone involved (the operator and spotters) must understand who will give the signal and who will receive it before any movement is executed.  (T-0). 5.45.7.  Before a vehicle is started for movement, a member of the crew or the operator (if no spotter is available) must walk completely around the vehicle to ensure that no personnel or property are in danger from the vehicle's movement.  (T-0). 5.45.7.1.  Will  verify  clearance:    (T-1).    Determine  visual  clear  distance  with  a  ground reference point from the cab of the vehicle. 5.45.7.2.  Will mount the vehicle, sound the horn (if tactical situation allows), and back to the rear of the pre-selected ground reference point.  (T-1).  Stop and repeat the process, as necessary, until the desired vehicle position is obtained.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 73 5.45.8.  Spotters should avoid walking backwards while guiding a vehicle.  If it is necessary for  a  spotter  to  walk  backwards,  he/she  must  first  check  to  ensure  there  are  no  potential hazards that may cause the spotter to slip, trip, or fall.  (T-1). 5.45.9.  The GMV operator will not put the vehicle into motion until visual contact is made with the spotter.  (T-1).  To ensure the safety of the GMV operator and the spotter, spotters must maintain visual contact with vehicle at all times (Figure 5.8.).  (T-1). Figure 5.8.  Visual Contact.  5.45.10.  The  spotters  keep  a  reasonable  and  safe  distance  between  themselves  and  the vehicle front, rear, and corners.  They will never be directly in front of or behind the vehicle.  (T-1). 5.45.11.  Spotters will not position themselves between the vehicle (and trailer, if applicable) being guided and another object, trailer, or fixed/portable loading ramp where an inadvertent engine surge or momentary loss of vehicle control could cause injury or death.  (T-1). 5.45.12.  If visual contact of the spotter is lost or if the GMV operator notices that the guide is dangerously positioned, the operator must immediately stop the vehicle.  (T-1).  The GMV operator  will  secure  their  vehicle,  dismount,  and  make  an  on-spot  correction  before continuing operations.  (T-1). 5.45.13.  At  night,  a  spotter  will  use  two  luminous  wands  (if  not  available,  flashlights  with clear or colored lenses are permitted) to give the proper signal for the vehicle to move.   (T-1). 5.45.13.1.  Spotters will move forward to make sure the way is clear, turn around to face the vehicle, and give the proper signal with the light.  (T-1).  The operator should move the vehicle forward until the light signal goes out, at which point he/she stops the vehicle.  This process is repeated as the vehicle is moved forward to its final stop. 5.45.13.2.  Again,  if  visual  contact  with  the  spotter  is  lost,  the  spotter  is  dangerously positioned,  or  the  operator  is  in  doubt,  the  operator  must  immediately  stop  the  vehicle.  (T-1). 5.46.  Air  Force Standard Spotting Hand and Arm Signals.  Standard hand and arm signals, known by all Airmen, are needed to ensure safe and effective spotting while guiding a vehicle.  Described below are the Air Force Standardized Basic Hand and Arm Signals (IAW TO 36M-1-141, 463L Material Handling Equipment System), which must be used by all operators of GMVs and spotters.  (T-1).  74 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 5.46.1.  Come towards the spotter.   Bend both  elbows, palms or night  wands facing up.   In unison, move forearms forward.  Signal either above your head, or to the sides of your body to ensure hand movements are clearly seen. Figure 5.9.  Standard Spotting Hand and Arm Signals – Come Towards the Spotter. 5.46.2.  Move away from the spotter.  Extend both arms downward with palms facing away or wands pointing down.  In unison, move arms forward and back.  At no time should hands be  above  waist  height.    Repeat  this  movement  until  the  operator  is  required  to  stop  the vehicle.    Note:    Picture  shows  motion  only.    Proper  positions  should  be  facing  the  GMV operator.  Figure 5.10.  Standard Spotting Hand and Arm Signals – Move Away from the Spotter. 5.46.3.  Right Turn/Left Turn.  Dependent on the placement of the spotter (forward or rear of the vehicle), the spotter should point to the direction that the vehicle needs to move with one hand,  and  raise  the  opposite  arm,  bent  at  the  elbow.    The  hand  or  wand  is  be  pointing  up. Motion the hand in the direction that the vehicle should move.   AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 75 Figure 5.11.  Standard Spotting Hand and Arm Signals.

Standard Spotting Hand and Arm Signals – Shut Down.  Section 5P—Parking 5.47.  General.  Except  on  one-way  streets,  always  park  on  the  right  side  of  the  street  in jurisdictions  where  operators  are  required  to  operate  the  GMV  on  the  right-side  of  the  road, except when local law states otherwise.  In jurisdictions where operators are required to operate the GMV on the left-side of the road, always park on the left side of the street, except when local law  states  otherwise.    Remember  to  lock  the  ignition  switch  on  vehicles  of  commercial  design and  remove  the  key.    Turn-off  the  master  switch  on  tactical  vehicles.    Exceptions  may  be directed by local commanders. 5.48.  Parallel  Parking.  Parallel  parking  to  the  curb  between  vehicles  is  difficult  for  many,  if not most, operators.  If followed, this step-by-step method can make parallel parking easier (see Figure 5.16.): 5.48.1.  Select a large enough space. 5.48.2.  Give the proper hand signal for stopping.  Pull up alongside the vehicle parked in the space ahead of the vacant parking space.  The vehicle being parked should be one to two feet away from the parked vehicle and the rear bumpers of both vehicles should be even. 5.48.3.  For jurisdictions where operators are required to operate the GMV on the right-side of the road, except when local law states otherwise: 5.48.3.1.  Start backing slowly.  Turn the steering wheel as hard as possible to the right as soon as the vehicle starts moving.  With the steering wheel all the way over to the right, continue backing until  the vehicle is  at  a 45-degree angle to  the curb.  At this point the right front door is opposite the rear bumper of the other vehicle. 5.48.3.2.  Straighten  the  front  wheels.    Go  straight  back  a  short  distance  until  the  right end  of  the  front  bumper  of  the  vehicle  being  parked  is  opposite  the  left  end  of  the  rear bumper of the parked vehicle. 5.48.3.3.  Pause a moment.  Now turn the steering wheel hard to the left and back slowly into the space, straightening the front wheels just as they approach the curb.  If unable to  78 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 get all the way into the space, usually the best thing to do is to drive all the way out, get the vehicle ahead of the space, and start again. 5.48.3.4.  Pull forward.  A vehicle being parked should divide the parking space, leaving as much distance between the vehicle and the parked vehicles both ahead and to the rear.  The front and rear wheels should be an equal distance from the curb and no more than a foot away. 5.48.3.5.  Turn-off the engine.  Before leaving the vehicle, set the parking brake and put the vehicle in reverse gear.  If the vehicle has an automatic transmission, place the lever in the PARK position.  When parking on a downgrade, if there is a curb, turn the wheels so  that  the  front  right  tire  is  against  the  curb  and  chock  the  front  of  the  rear  wheels.  When  parking  on  an  upgrade,  turn  the  wheels  left  and  away  from  the  curb  so  that  the back of the right front tire locks against the curb and chock the back of the rear wheels.  Doing this ensures that the vehicle does not roll.  When parking uphill without a curb, the operator will use chocks behind the rear tires.  (T-1).  When parking downhill without a curb, the operator will place chocks in front of the front tires (see Figure 5.17.).  (T-1). 5.48.3.6.  The  parking  brake  is  the  primary  safety  item.    Only  use  chock  blocks  as  a secondary safety item in conjunction with the parking brake.  Using chock blocks alone is not enough or effective.  The parking brake must be set at all times when the vehicle is parked.  (T-0). 5.48.4.  For jurisdictions where operators are required to operate the GMV on the left-side of the road, except when local law states otherwise: 5.48.4.1.  Start backing slowly.  Turn the steering wheel as hard as possible to the left as soon as the vehicle starts  moving.  With the steering wheel  all the way over to  the left, continue backing until  the vehicle is  at  a 45-degree angle to  the curb.  At this point the left front door is opposite the rear bumper of the other vehicle. 5.48.4.2.  Straighten the front wheels.  Go straight back a short distance until the left end of  the  front  bumper  of  the  vehicle  being  parked  is  opposite  the  right  end  of  the  rear bumper of the parked vehicle. 5.48.4.3.  Pause  a  moment.    Now  turn  the  steering  wheel  hard  to  the  right  and  back slowly  into  the  space,  straightening  the  front  wheels  just  as  they  approach  the  curb.    If unable to get all the way into the space, usually the best thing to do is to drive all the way out, get the vehicle ahead of the space, and start again. 5.48.4.4.  Pull forward.  A vehicle being parked should divide the parking space, leaving as much distance between the vehicle and the parked vehicles both ahead and to the rear.  The front and rear wheels should be an equal distance from the curb and no more than a foot away. 5.48.4.5.  Turn-off the engine.  Before leaving the vehicle, set the parking brake and put the vehicle in reverse gear.  If the vehicle has an automatic transmission, place the lever in the PARK position.  When parking on a downgrade, if there is a curb, turn the wheels so that the front left tire is against the curb and chock the front of the rear wheels.  When parking on an upgrade, turn the wheels right and away from the curb so that the back of the left front tire locks against the curb and chock the back of the rear wheels.  Doing this  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 79 ensures that the vehicle does not roll.  When parking uphill without a curb, the operator will use chocks behind the rear tires.  (T-1).  When parking downhill without a curb, the operator will place chocks in front of the front tires (see Figure 5.17.).  (T-1). 5.48.4.6.  The  parking  brake  is  the  primary  safety  item.    Only  use  chock  blocks  as  a secondary safety item in conjunction with the parking brake.  Using chock blocks alone is not enough or effective.  The parking brake must be set at all times when the vehicle is parked.  (T-0). Figure 5.16.  Parking Parallel to a Curb.  5.49.  Diagonal  or  Angle  Parking.  Diagonal  or  angle  parking  is  easy  enough  for  most operators.  However, remember the following: 5.49.1.  Give the hand signal for stopping. 5.49.2.  Begin turning into the parking space from a position about five feet from the row of parked vehicles. 5.49.3.  Turn  the  steering  wheel  in  the  direction  of  the  space  and  enter  the  space  with  the vehicle as straight as possible with the angle of the space. 5.49.4.  For jurisdictions where operators are required to operate the GMV on the right-side of the road, except when local law states otherwise:  80 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 5.49.4.1.  Use the parked vehicle or line marking on the left as a guide.  However, be very careful to allow enough clearance between the moving vehicle and those parked on either side. 5.49.4.2.  When  coming  out  of  a  diagonal  parking  space,  back  very  slowly  until  far enough to see traffic that may be coming and stop if necessary.  Turn the steering wheel sharply when the left front wheel is opposite the rear bumper of the vehicle parked to the left.  In turning too soon, it is possible to sideswipe the other vehicle while backing out. 5.49.5.  For jurisdictions where operators are required to operate the GMV on the left-side of the road, except when local law states otherwise: 5.49.5.1.  Use  the  parked  vehicle  or  line  marking  on  the  right  as  a  guide.    However,  be very careful to allow enough clearance between the moving vehicle and those parked on either side. 5.49.5.2.  When  coming  out  of  a  diagonal  parking  space,  back  very  slowly  until  far enough to see traffic that may be coming and stop if necessary.  Turn the steering wheel sharply  when the right  front wheel  is  opposite the rear bumper of the  vehicle parked to the right.  In turning too soon, it is possible to sideswipe the other vehicle while backing out. 5.50.  Improper  Parking.  Improper  parking  may  inconvenience  and  endanger  other  drivers.  Do not park: 5.50.1.  In violation of local traffic laws. 5.50.2.  In an intersection or in front of a driveway. 5.50.3.  In unauthorized parking places (such as handicap, fire lanes, and so forth). Figure 5.17.  Parking on a Hill.   AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 81 Section 5Q—Driving at Night 5.51.  Driving at Night.  An operator can often see several thousand feet ahead in the daytime if the road is straight and there are no obstructions.  However, at night (even with good headlights) an operator can usually see no more than a few hundred feet ahead. Vision to the sides and the rear is also restricted.  Reduced vision can be caused by: 5.51.1.  A reflected beam by an object or a pedestrian.  It may be very small and can decrease very rapidly as the distance increases. 5.51.2.  Hills and curves. 5.51.3.  Rearview mirrors that are not properly adjusted. 5.51.4.  Glare from the headlights of other vehicles. 5.51.5.  The light from buildings or signs along the road. 5.51.6.  A dirty windshield multiplies the effect of glare. 5.52.  Driving at Night Precautions.  Take the following precautions when driving at night: 5.52.1.  At twilight, turn on the headlights, not just parking lights.  Most states require that an operator use their headlights from sunset to sunrise in order to be more visible to others. 5.52.2.  Be aware that some other drivers may not have turned on their lights. 5.52.3.  An operator should never drive so fast that they cannot stop within the distance able to be seen ahead with the headlights. 5.52.4.  Use low beams when driving in cities and towns, except on streets where there is no other lighting. 5.52.5.  Use  low  beams  when  following  a  vehicle  whenever  within  200  feet  of  the  vehicle ahead. 5.52.6.  Use low beams when approaching traffic in oncoming lanes. 5.52.7.  Use high-beam headlights on highways only when it is safe and legal to do so (such as when no other vehicle is approaching). 5.52.8.  Lower  the  high  beams  when  approaching  an  oncoming  vehicle.    When  meeting another  vehicle  on  the  road  at  night,  the  operator  should  divert  their  eyes  from  directly looking  into  the  oncoming  vehicle’s  headlights.    Do  not  flick  the  lights  at  an  oncoming vehicle if the other driver fails to lower their high beam. 5.52.9.  If the high beams of an oncoming car are not dimmed, avoid looking directly at the bright lights.  Glance toward the side of the road; then quickly look ahead to determine the other vehicle's position. 5.53.  Parking at Night.  When parking at night, follow the guidelines below: 5.53.1.  Never leave the  headlights  on.  They are just as likely to  blind approaching drivers when  the  vehicle  is  standing  still  as  they  are  when  it  is  moving.    They  may  also  confuse approaching  drivers  about  the  exact  position  of  the  road.    This  danger  is  increased  if  the vehicle is parked on the wrong side of the road.  82 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 5.53.2.  Turn  on  the  parking  lights  or  four-way  emergency  flasher  whenever  parking  on  or along  a highway  at  night.    Exception:   Emergency  vehicles may leave headlights  on when they are required to illuminate an area in an emergency.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 83 Chapter 6 PROCEDURES FOR TRANSPORTING PERSONNEL Section 6A—General Information and Procedures 6.1.  General  Information.  The  operator  of  an  AF  GMV  transporting  military  or  civilian personnel  has a special  obligation to  their passengers.   These responsibilities are in  addition  to the previously described responsibilities for operating a vehicle. 6.2.  General  Procedures.  Many passengers transported may be from other bases or they may be visiting dignitaries from nearby cities.  The visitor’s first impression is the one they remember most.    The  way  an  operator  performs  their  duties  when  transporting  personnel  directly  reflects upon their motor transportation operation.  Regardless the grade or status of a passenger (officer, enlisted or civilian), an operator should always: 6.2.1.  Report promptly to the person requesting transportation. 6.2.2.  Show courtesy to all passengers regardless of grade. 6.2.3.  Open and close the vehicle door for passengers of senior grades. 6.2.4.  See that all passengers have secured seat and shoulder belts (if installed). 6.2.5.  Park the vehicle so passengers are able to load and unload on the curbside. Section 6B—Special Situations 6.3.  Transporting  Personnel  Off  Base:  There  may  be  the  requirement  for  an  operator  to transport personnel to off-base destinations.  When picking up personnel from off-base locations, park the vehicle as near the exit or entrance as possible. 6.4.  Distinguished  Visitors  (DVs):  As  a  military  operator,  the  opportunity  may  arise  to transport  DVs  (such  as  high-ranking  officers  or  civilians,  dignitaries,  and  so  on)  who  visit  the base.    Generally,  a  DV  is  assigned  one  operator  for  their  entire  visit.    The  length  of  the  visit varies,  but  is  usually  one  to  three  days.    A  group  of  DVs  normally  consists  of  three  to  eight persons.  The group generally has one person who acts as a liaison between the operator and the guests.  This designated person is who the operator will report to and from whom they will also receive their orders.  (T-1). 6.4.1.  This  person  will  have  the  itinerary  for  the  DVs  and  will  be  able  to  tell  the  operator when and where they need to be available with their vehicle.  (T-1). 6.4.2.  Between runs, be sure that the vehicle is  ready for further service.  Keep the vehicle wiped-off, windows clean, and floor swept.  The operator and vehicle must be neat and clean at all times.  (T-1).  If the operator and vehicle are needed past normal duty hours, a change of uniform may be required. 6.4.3.  Salute  when  reporting  to  an  officer  to  inform  them  their  transportation  is  available. When the officer  arrives at  the vehicle, the operator must stand at  attention, open the door, and salute.  (T-1).  Additional officers must be saluted upon arriving at the vehicle.   (T-1).  Stand at parade rest by the vehicle door the officer may enter.  84 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 6.4.4.  When transporting general officers, display the appropriate star plates and flags. When a general officer is not present, plates and flags will be cased.  (T-1).  When reveille or retreat is sounded, stop the vehicle and remain seated. 6.5.  Buses:  Perform the following when transporting personnel on buses: 6.5.1.  Secure all equipment to prevent possible injury to passengers. 6.5.2.  Permit only authorized passengers to ride in the vehicle. 6.5.3.  Permit passengers to board or leave the vehicle only when the vehicle has come to a complete stop. 6.5.4.  Do  not  permit  passengers  to  extend  legs  or  arms  outside  the  vehicle  when  it  is  in motion. 6.5.5.  Never permit a passenger to obstruct a clear view of the road.  An operator needs to have maximum visibility to drive safely. 6.5.6.  See  that  baggage,  if  carried,  is  safely  stowed  and  secured  and  not  in  the  way  of  the passengers.  Obey the regulations prohibiting the overload of vehicles. 6.5.7.  Place the vehicle next to the curb or to the extreme right/left (IAW direction of traffic) of the roadway when loading or unloading passengers. 6.5.8.  Do not allow the use of tobacco in military vehicles. 6.5.9.  Stop the vehicle between 15 and 50 feet before railroad crossings.  Listen and look in both directions for trains.  Before crossing after a train has passed, be sure another train is not coming in the other direction on other tracks.  If the vehicle has manual transmission, do not change gears while crossing the tracks. 6.5.10.  Slow down and carefully check for other vehicles at these locations: 6.5.10.1.  Streetcar crossings. 6.5.10.2.  Railroad tracks used only for industrial switching within a business district. 6.5.10.3.  Where a policeman or flagman is directing traffic. 6.5.10.4.  Where a traffic signal shows green. 6.5.11.  Avoid sudden stops and starts or any jerky movement. 6.5.12.  Comply with federal, state, municipal, and area laws and regulations pertaining to the operation of buses and mass personnel carrying vehicles when the vehicle is used over public streets or highways. 6.5.13.  Stop at drawbridges that do not have a signal light or traffic control attendant.  Stop at least 50 feet before the draw of the bridge. 6.5.13.1.  Be sure the draw is completely closed before crossing. 6.5.13.2.  Slow down and be sure it is safe to cross when there is a traffic light showing green  or  there  is  an  attendant  or  traffic  officer  that  controls  traffic  whenever  the  bridge opens.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 85 6.6.  Trucks  and  Panel  Vans:  Allow  passengers  to  be  carried  only  in  trucks  equipped  with sideboards  and  end  enclosures  (to  include  safety  straps)  at  least  36  inches  above  the  standing surface of the vehicle body.  Require all passengers to be seated when the vehicle is in motion.  Safety  straps  must  be  connected  when  transporting  personnel.    (T-0).    Be  sure  the  passengers have enough room to stay seated within the vehicle.  The operator must lower the tailgate when loading or unloading personnel and secure it before moving the vehicle.  (T-0). 6.6.1.  When transporting personnel, the operator is  responsible for delivering them to  their destinations safely and on time.  The operator should: 6.6.1.1.  Be  courteous  and  responsive  to  the  instructions  of  official  passengers,  unit commanders, and cargo security personnel traveling with them. 6.6.1.2.  Talk as little as possible while en-route. 6.6.1.3.  Observe  the  rules  of  military  courtesy  when  loading  or  discharging  officer personnel. 6.6.1.4.  Do  not  exceed  the  passenger  limit  of  the  vehicle  except  in  an  emergency  or  as directed by supervision. 6.6.1.5.  Do  not  move  the  vehicle  if  any  personnel  are  in  unsafe  positions  (such  as standing;  attempting  to  ride  between  the  cab  and  body;  hanging  on  sideboards,  running boards, or fenders; or sitting on the tailgate or sides of the truck).  (T-0). 6.6.1.6.  The  operator  may  transport  personnel  in  the  cargo  bed  of  a  general-purpose pickup truck if they follow these safety procedures: 6.6.1.6.1.  Be sure vehicle is equipped with a working tailgate. 6.6.1.6.2.  Be  sure  passengers  are  seated  on  the  cargo  deck  with  no  portion  of  their bodies overhanging the vehicle sides or rear. 6.6.1.6.3.  Do not operate the vehicle off base. 6.6.1.6.4.  Be cautious when entering and exiting pickup trucks. 6.6.1.6.5.  Tailgates  do  not  have  to  be  lowered  for  personnel  to  enter  and  exit  the cargo deck of the vehicle. 6.7.  Emergency  Vehicles:  Personnel  may  be  designated  as  an  operator  of  an  ambulance  or other emergency  vehicle.  However, the person  designated  must still conform  to  normal  traffic regulations  unless  otherwise  directed  by  their  supervisor  or  as  required  by  an  emergency situation.  Emergency runs will be restricted to actual emergencies.  (T-0). 6.7.1.  The  speed  of  emergency  vehicles  will  be  reasonable  and  proper  with  due  regard  for actual and potential hazards.  (T-0).  Ambulances and police vehicles will exceed the posted speed  limits  only  in  emergencies  and  as  directed  by  the  provost  marshal  or  security  police directives.  (T-0). 6.7.2.  Certain emergency vehicles are equipped with warning devices (usually a siren and/or a red or blue flashing light).  These warning devices should be used to get other vehicles to yield  the  right-of-way.   Under no circumstances  will the operator assume that these  signals give full clearance to operate the vehicle without suitable regard for life, property, and traffic laws.  (T-0).  86 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 6.7.3.  Unless  ordered  otherwise,  by  the  medical  officer  in  charge,  do  not  use  the  sirens  on ambulances.  Except when responding to an emergency call, observe all traffic laws carefully during the transfer of patients. 6.7.4.  When responding to  an emergency, emergency vehicles may proceed through a stop sign or light (if not in violation of local law), only after slowing down or stopping to assure safe operation. 6.7.5.  Police vehicles responding to emergency calls use sirens and flashing lights according to local directives or as directed by the provost marshal or the Chief of Security Forces. 6.7.6.  The  foregoing  provisions  do  not  relieve  emergency  vehicle  operators  from  the responsibility to drive with regard for the safety of all persons and property.  Nor do any of these provisions protect the operator from the consequence of any reckless disregard for the safety and wellbeing of others. 6.7.7.  As an emergency vehicle operator, personnel will receive additional operator training and  must  be  licensed  IAW  this  manual  (See  Chapter  3)  and  DoDI  6055.04  to  operate emergency vehicles.  (T-1).  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 87 Chapter 7 MAINTAINING SAFE VEHICLES Section 7A—General Maintenance Responsibilities 7.1.  General Information.  This chapter contains the general maintenance responsibilities of an operator of an AF GMV to keep the vehicle in a safe operating condition, including preventative maintenance, necessary equipment, pre-operation inspection, and the necessary forms. 7.2.  Fuel-Efficient  Operations:  A qualified operator of an AF GMV should operate a vehicle in  the  most  fuel-efficient  manner.    To  do  so,  he/she  should  adopt  a  fuel-conservation  attitude.  Apply the following tips to help develop this attitude: 7.2.1.  Plan trips to avoid unnecessary "cold starts." 7.2.2.  Consolidate short trips whenever possible. 7.2.3.  Reduce  vehicle's  cool-down  time  and  select  a  route  with  consideration  for  terrain, weather, and type of vehicle. 7.2.4.  Maintain the vehicle with particular attention to proper tire inflation, brakes grabbing or pulling, oil and lubrication specifications, tune-ups, and required vehicle service schedule. 7.2.5.  Adhere to posted speed limits when driving, lower speeds reduce air resistance and are safer. 7.3.  Credit  Card:  The  use  of  a  U.S.  Government  National  Credit  Card  or  DoD  Fleet  Card  is controlled since it could possibly be misused if lost and then found by dishonest  persons.  The operator will be expected to sign for this item and to limit its use to an absolute minimum and only  for  authorized  purchases.    (T-0).    Proper  servicing  of  vehicles  before  departure  from  the base may reduce the need for credit card purchases. 7.4.  DoD Fleet Card Overview.  DoD Fleet Cards are used to obtain fuel and services from off-base  commercial  service  stations  when  the  vehicle  is  operating  away  from  military installations/service stations.  The cards are not credit cards, e.g., VISA® or MasterCard®, and are  only  accepted  at  participating  businesses.    Dependent  on  individual  unit  account  policy, purchases  of  other  items  or  services  other  than  fuel  may  be  authorized  and  may  be  limited  to those which are needed in order to keep a USAF vehicle in (or return to) serviceable condition.  For additional guidance on DoD Fleet Card use and policy, refer to AFI 24-302. 7.5.  Use Overview.  When required, the following items and services may be procured with the credit card.  Note:  Operators of government vehicles will use self-service pumps when available at commercial service stations to purchase the fuels noted below:  (T-1). 7.5.1.  Gasoline (regular unleaded, premium unleaded, special unleaded). 7.5.2.  Gasoline  (aviation  grade,  unleaded  for  boats,  diesel  marine  fuel  oil,  and  aviation turbine fuel). 7.5.3.  Gasohol. 7.5.4.  Diesel fuels.  88 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 7.5.5.  Diesel Exhaust Fluids. 7.5.6.  Lubricating service and lubricants (including differential and transmission lubricant). 7.5.7.  Oil filter elements and servicing. 7.5.8.  Ethylene Glycol Antifreeze. 7.5.9.  Brake fluid. 7.5.10.  Air filters (replacement of throwaway type only, cleaning of permanent type). 7.5.11.  Battery charging. 7.5.12.  Tire and tube repairs. 7.5.13.  Mounting and dismounting snow tires or chains. 7.5.14.  Emergency  replacement  of  spark  plugs,  fan  and  generator  belts,  windshield  wiper arms and blades, lamps, and so forth. 7.5.15.  Other emergency repairs, known in the automobile trade as “road repairs.” Section 7B—Armored Vehicle and Preventative Maintenance 7.6.  Armored Vehicle Maintenance. 7.6.1.  Armored  vehicles  require  increased-interval  maintenance  due  to  the  intense  wear  on the  suspension,  steering,  and  braking  systems.    These  components  of  the  vehicle  may prematurely fail unless more frequently checked by the operator. 7.6.2.  Ensure  mission  requirements  provide  time  and  opportunity  to  the  inspect  vehicles  at an increased rate. 7.7.  Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services. 7.7.1.  Preventive  maintenance  checks  and  services  (PMCS)  are  commonly  known  as operator  maintenance.    It  is  part  of  the  overall  maintenance  program  that  the  using organization must perform on its assigned equipment.  (T-1).  PMCS is the systematic care of a  vehicle.    This  includes  the  daily  cleaning,  servicing,  and  inspecting  for  maintenance discrepancies. 7.7.2.  The  purpose  of  PMCSs  is  to  maintain  serviceability  at  reduced  cost.    Detecting  and correcting defects in their early stages before they develop into major defects results in lower maintenance costs and less vehicle out-of-commission time. regulations  direct  otherwise, 7.7.3.  Unless the  operator  performs  organizational maintenance.    The  operator  must  properly  and  safely  operate  their  vehicle,  as  they  are  the most  important  single  factor  in  preventive  maintenance.    (T-1).    Daily  maintenance  of  the vehicle includes: 7.7.3.1.  Inspecting,  servicing,  adjusting,  documenting,  and  cleaning according to procedures in TO 36-1-191 and AFI 24-302. the  vehicle 7.7.3.2.  Recording  any  deficiencies  and  shortcomings  (include  those  that  are  corrected by  replacing  parts  and  those  that  are  not  corrected)  using  AF  Form  1800,  Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report, IAW AFI 24-302.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 89 7.7.3.2.1.  Deficiencies  are  malfunctions  that  may  result  in  an  unsafe  condition  to personnel or serious damage to the vehicle (for example, loose battery connections or a missing or broken rearview mirror or wiper blade on the operator’s side). 7.7.3.2.2.  Shortcomings  are  defects  or  malfunctions  that  must  be  corrected  to  make the  vehicle  completely  serviceable  (for  example,  a  missing  battery  cap  or  broken speedometer).  (T-1). 7.8.  Equipment for Maintaining Safe Vehicles: 7.8.1.  Fire Extinguishers.  IAW AFMAN 91-201 and 49 CFR Part 393.95, fire extinguishers must be on all vehicles that are used to support explosive operations (T-0). 7.8.1.1.  Fire  Extinguishers  rated  to  handle  explosives  (Class  2A:10BC)  must  be immediately available during explosive operations.  (T-0).  Unless otherwise directed by the installation Fire Chief, one fire extinguisher must be available for each piece of MHE used to handle explosives.  (T-0).  Individual fire extinguishers are not required for each piece of MHE when there is a minimum of two Class 2A:10BC fire extinguishers readily available at the location where explosives are being handled. 7.8.1.2.  Vehicles  used  to  transport  explosives  are  considered  explosive-laden  vehicles.  These vehicles must have a minimum of two Class 2A:10BC rated extinguishers during the movement of explosives.  (T-0). 7.8.1.2.1.  One  extinguisher  will  be  mounted  on  the  exterior  driver’s  side  of  the vehicle  and  one  will  be  mounted  inside  the  cab,  readily  accessible  to  the  operator.  (T-0). 7.8.1.2.2.  If  explosive-laden  vehicles  are  parked  at  a  location  designated  for explosive  operations;  additional  fire  extinguishers  beyond  those  required  are  not required. 7.8.1.3.  Fire  extinguishers  will  be  required  on  all  vehicles  with  a  passenger  carrying capacity of 9 passengers or more when traveling off the installation.  (T-0). 7.8.2.  Road side equipment and warning devices.  Whenever GMVs are stopped on traveled portions  of  the  highway,  for  any  cause  other  than  necessary  traffic  stops,  the  operator  will place the warning devices (triangles) required by Federal Law.  (T-0). 7.8.3.  First Aid Kits.  Operators will ensure buses are equipped with first aid kits that meet or exceed Department of Transportation (DoT), State or Local requirements.  (T-0). 7.8.3.1.

(T-1).  The operator must also provide routine service and repairs on their assigned vehicle.  (T-1).  An operator could be held liable for damages to their vehicle if they fail to properly inspect for and annotate discrepancies. 7.9.1.  Before operation purpose.  Before-operation inspection is a visual inspection to make sure  the  vehicle  is  safe  and  in  good  operating  condition  before  it  is  driven.    Many  defects, especially  leaks,  are  more  apparent  after  the  vehicle  has  been  parked  overnight.    Proper before-operation  inspection,  servicing,  and  proper  starting  procedures  may  increase  the useful life of the vehicle. 7.9.1.1.  Refer to  the Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual  and respective lesson plan, and see  Chapter  5  and  Chapter  7  of  this  Manual  for  before-operation  and  starting procedures. 7.9.2.  During operation.  During-operation inspection consists of the operator being alert to indications of vehicle malfunction while driving. 7.9.2.1.  During-operation inspection includes, but is not limited to, the following: 7.9.2.1.1.  Unusual vibrations, noise, and odors. 7.9.2.1.2.  Abnormal instrument readings. 7.9.2.1.3.  Erratic brake and steering operations. 7.9.2.2.  Good  operators  habitually  inspect  their  vehicles  at  each  halt.    A  walk-around inspection to check the tires, suspension, and load (an abbreviated after-operation check) is appropriate. 7.9.2.3.  During  this  inspection,  the  operator  may  discover  and  correct  equipment  faults that might cause a breakdown. 7.9.2.3.1.  The  operator  will  notify  their  supervisor  as  soon  as  possible  of  any problem with a vehicle and keep them informed of its status.  (T-1).  Unusual noises, vibrations,  and  changes  in  engine  performance  detected  en-route,  but  not  identified, should be reported to the supervisor. 7.9.3.  After operation.   After-operation inspection consists of all daily vehicle services  and correction,  if  possible,  of  any  deficiencies  found.    This  inspection  prepares  the  vehicle  for operation on a moment’s notice. 7.9.3.1.  After-operation  maintenance  procedures  are  prescribed Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual, TO, and/or respective lesson plan. in the  vehicle Section 7D—Air Force Equipment and Maintenance Forms and Records 7.10.  Air  Force  Equipment  and  Maintenance  Forms  and  Records.  Use  the  information below  to  perform  required  inspections  and  maintenance.    In  addition,  perform  and  document inspection and maintenance using AF Form 1800.  Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained and disposed of IAW the AFRIMS, RDS.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 91 7.10.1.  Damage.    Inspect  the  general  condition  of  the  vehicle.    Check  for  tampering  or damage that may have occurred since the vehicle was last operated.  Inspect doors, windows, windshields, seats, and upholstery.  Examine paint condition and legibility of markings. 7.10.2.  Leaks.   Inspect  the engine compartment  and look  under the vehicle for evidence of leaks. 7.10.3.  Tire,  Jack,  and  Lug  Wrench.    Be  sure  lugs  are  tight  and  tires  have  correct  air pressure.  The tires, including the spare tire must also have the appropriate tread remaining IAW TO 36-1-191.  (T-0). 7.10.3.1.  When a vehicle is supported on a jack stand, chock at least one wheel.  When both front wheels are in a raised position, chock the rear wheels. 7.10.4.  Fuel, Oil, and Coolant.  Check fuel, engine oil, and coolant.  Add amounts necessary to bring them to the correct levels.  Do not overfill.  Add only premixed coolant solution. 7.10.5.  Battery.  Inspect fluid levels, terminal, clamps, hold down, and so forth for security and corrosion.  Add water, clean surfaces, and tighten any loose connections. 7.10.6.  Personnel will remove watches, rings, ID tags, and all other jewelry before checking or inspecting the batteries.  (T-1). 7.10.7.  Horn.  Inspect the horn for security of mounting and operation. 7.10.8.  Lights  and  Reflectors.    Inspect  all  lights  and  reflectors  for  condition  and  proper operation. 7.10.9.  Instruments.    During  operation,  monitor  all  instrument  readings  for  indications  of malfunctions.    Do  not  continue  to  operate  the  vehicle  if  instrument  readings  are  not  within acceptable limits or if warning lights are lit or buzzers are sounding. 7.10.10.  Windshield Wipers.   Inspect for condition of blades and proper operation of blades and wiper assembly. 7.10.11.  Windshield.  Clean windshield and other glass surfaces on a daily basis.  Inspect for cracks or discoloration that would obstruct visibility.  Fill windshield washer reservoir. 7.10.12.  Cargo and Mounted Equipment.  Inspect for security, proper operation, and damage of  mounted  equipment.    Mounted  equipment  will  receive  the  same  type  of  service  and inspection as the vehicle.  (T-1). 7.10.13.  Vehicle Components.  Clean inside and outside of vehicle as needed. 7.10.14.  Steering.  During operation, check steering for abnormal steering. 7.10.15.  Safety Devices.  Inspect condition and operation of all safety devices (such as  seat belts, horn, lights, warning buzzer, warning decals, and fire extinguisher). 7.10.16.  Drive Belts and Pulley.  Inspect belts for deterioration, wear, and proper tension. 7.10.17.  Brakes.    Inspect  brake  pedal  for  free  travel.    Brake  pedal  should  have  some  free travel,  but  it  should  not  exceed  one-half  of  the  total  pedal  travel  distance.    Inspect  parking brake  for  operation  and  effectiveness.    For  special-purpose  vehicles,  inspect  (daily  when used) and adjust levels of hydraulic fluid in the master cylinder reservoir as necessary.  92 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 7.10.18.  Lube and Oil Change.  Maintain lube and oil at the prescribed levels.  This includes any  special  (daily,  weekly,  and  so  on)  lubrication  requirements  specified  for  the  vehicle  or mounted  equipment.    Make  sure  that  lubrication  and  oil  changes  are  done  at  established intervals (miles or month). 7.10.19.  Other.    The  “other”  space  on  the  operator’s  inspection  guide  and  trouble  report  is provided  for  inspections.    It  is  also  used  for  the  recording  of  defects  found  during  vehicle inspections that are not otherwise covered by the form. 7.11.  Defects  .  If no defects are found during the before-operation checks and all cleaning and servicing  requirements  have  been  met,  the  operator  is  ready  to  start  operating  the  vehicle.    If vehicle defects are found, enter the details in the appropriate space on the operator’s inspection guide and trouble report. 7.11.1.  When correction of these defects  exceeds the operator’s responsibility, take the AF Form  and  the  vehicle  to  the  Vehicle  Management  Customer  Service  Center  for  corrective action. 7.11.2.  In some cases, required maintenance of the vehicle may be delayed by maintenance control due to the type of defect or to maintenance work backlog. 7.11.2.1.  When  maintenance  is  deferred,  maintenance  control  personnel  will  enter  the status  code  and  initial  the  driver’s  form  to  show  that  defects  have  been  reported  and maintenance  delayed.    (T-1).    This  form  must  be  retained  in  the  vehicle  as  a  record  of defects that have been reported to maintenance control.  (T-1). 7.11.2.2.  Any new maintenance defects not previously reported and identified as delayed maintenance, must be reported to maintenance control.  (T-1).  Maintenance control will update the inspection guide when delayed maintenance items have been  completed.  (T-1).    Refer  to  AFI  24-302  for  more  specific  information  on  reporting  a  vehicle  for maintenance.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 93 Chapter 8 HAZARDS AND SAFETY INFORMATION Section 8A—General Hazards and Safety Information 8.1.  General.  This  chapter  contains  general  hazards  and  safety  information  pertaining  to  all operators  of  AF  GMVs  who  can  face  many  hazardous  driving  situations.    Hazards  may  be  the result of weather, time of day, or season of the year.  They may be caused by conditions of the road, the vehicle being driven, or vehicles driven by others. Section 8B—Hazards and Safety Measures 8.2.  Vehicle Hazards:  Pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, and animals pose special problems for operators.  Many times they are difficult to see and an operator should be alert at all times in order to avoid a collision with them. 8.3.  Pedestrians.  In the United States, about 40,000 people are killed in  traffic accidents each year.  When pedestrians are involved in collisions, speeds of no greater than 15 or 20 mph often prove  fatal.    By  being  alert  and  aware  of  his/her  surroundings,  an  operator  can  avoid  fatal accidents with pedestrians. 8.3.1.  An  operator  should  inform  pedestrians  of  his/her  intentions  by  using  the  proper signals. 8.3.2.  The operator should also anticipate the pedestrian’s intentions.  A pedestrian’s actions are not always predictable, so be prepared at all times. 8.3.2.1.  If a person is in the street or driving near pedestrians, slow down the vehicle and be ready to stop. 8.3.2.2.  Never pass a stopped vehicle that is permitting a pedestrian to cross traffic. 8.3.2.3.  Watch people on the sidewalks  and at the side of the road.  They may not stay there. 8.3.2.4.  The operator should allow enough space between his/her vehicle and the row of parked vehicles in case a pedestrian steps from between them. 8.3.2.5.  When  approaching  a  pedestrian  from  the  rear,  carefully  pass  them  allowing plenty of room between them and the vehicle. 8.3.3.  School Zones. 8.3.3.1.  In school zones, slow down to the posted speed limit and watch for pedestrians. 8.3.3.2.  Obey  the  directions  given  by  members  of  the  school  safety  patrol  or  by  the school crossing guards. 8.3.3.3.  When  stopped  by  the  stop  signal  of  a  school  bus,  do  not  move  until  the  bus  is placed in motion and the roadway is clear of students. 8.3.4.  Intersections.  Observe the following rules at intersections:  94 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 8.3.4.1.  Pedestrians have the right-of-way where there are no traffic lights. 8.3.4.2.  Pedestrians  must  obey  the  same  traffic  light  signals,  at  intersections,  as operators.  (T-0).  Pedestrians also obey special crossing lights at intersections (instead of traffic  lights)  where  present.  However  it  will  always  be  the  operator’s  responsibility  to yield if they do not.  (T-0). 8.3.4.3.  When  crossing  on  a  green  light,  pedestrians  will  have  the  right-of-way.    (T-0).  If a light changes to yellow or red while crossing, operators must allow them to complete crossing safely.  (T-0). 8.3.4.4.  Pedestrians crossing on a special pedestrian signal have the right-of-way just as they do when crossing on a green light. 8.3.4.5.  A  blind  pedestrian  is  entitled,  by  law,  to  special  consideration  at  intersections with  no  traffic  lights.    When  a  blind  pedestrian  enters  an  intersection,  all  approaching vehicles  must  stop  and  must  remain  stopped  until  the  blind  pedestrian  has  completed crossing.  (T-0). 8.4.  Bicyclists.  Bicyclists  are expected to  obey the same traffic  rules and regulations  as GMV operators.    However,  many  individuals  may  not  obey  or  even  know  the  rules.    Another  major problem for operators, especially at night, is their inability to see bicyclists. 8.4.1.  Be cautious because a bicyclist could be in the blind spot of the vehicle.  Keep on the lookout and slow down when approaching bicyclists. 8.4.2.  Give bicyclists plenty of room when passing and be prepared to stop suddenly. 8.5.  Motorcyclists.  It is often difficult to see motorcyclists, especially when they are coming up from behind, coming from the side streets, and around curves.  Always look out for them when approaching an intersection. 8.5.1.  When  passing  motorcyclists,  give  them  plenty  of  room.    If  they  look  over  their shoulder, it could indicate that they intend to change lanes.  Give them time and space to do so. 8.5.2.  Motorcyclists may suddenly need to avoid uneven road surfaces and obstacles such as drain covers or oily, wet, or icy patches on the road.  Give riders sufficient room to react. 8.6.  Animals.  An  operator  should  always  be  alert  to  the  possibility  of  a  collision  with  an animal.    A  collision  with  even  a  small  animal  can  cause  serious  vehicle  damage  and  endanger human life.  Operators should remain highly observant for local wildlife and domestic animals.  Be  thoroughly  familiar  with  and  obey  all  local  laws.    Exercise  good  judgment  and  drive defensively at all times to avoid endangering not only animals, but also human life and property. 8.7.  School Buses. 8.7.1.  Except on highways with a physical median, all traffic in both directions must come to a  complete  stop  whenever  a  school  bus  stops  to  pick  up  or  discharge  passengers  (Figure 8.1.).  (T-0). 8.7.1.1.  In  some  localities,  this  rule  applies  to  certain  other  vehicles  (such  as  city  or church buses).  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 95 8.7.2.  Traffic must remain stopped until the bus driver turns off the special “stop lights” on the front and rear and/or withdraws the special stop sign located on the left side of the bus. (T-0). Figure 8.1.  Stopping for a School Bus. 8.8.  Emergency  Vehicles.  Emergency  vehicles  including,  but  not  limited  to,  police  cars, ambulances, and fire trucks will be entitled to the right-of-way whenever they give an audible or visual warning of their approach.  (T-0).  8.8.1.  This warning is usually a siren.  Additional warnings may be given by using a bell or flashing red or blue lights. 8.8.2.  The law requires that GMV operators must pull to the right-hand curb or edge of the road  and  come  to  a  complete  stop.    (T-0).    They  must  remain  stopped  until  the  emergency vehicle has passed or until they are directed to proceed by a police officer.  (T-0). 8.8.2.1.  Though laws and regulations require that an operator pull to the right side of the road, they do not require them to do it carelessly or without regard to consequences. 8.8.2.2.  Look  before  turning  the  steering  wheel.    Turning  suddenly  to  the  right  without looking, may cause a collision with the emergency vehicle, another driver, a pedestrian, or a bicyclist. 8.8.3.  Never follow within 500 feet of a fire truck or other emergency vehicle. 8.8.4.  Never drive into or park in a block where an emergency vehicle has stopped in answer to an alarm.  Doing so exposes the operator to unnecessary dangers and may hinder the work of the emergency workers. 8.8.5.  Never drive over a fire hose unless directed to do so by a fireman or police officer. 8.9.  Weather  Hazards.  Bad weather means poor driving conditions.  Rain, snow and ice, and fog reduce visibility and make driving dangerous.  Visibility may be limited to only a few feet ahead  of  the  vehicle.    While  operating  a  vehicle  in  any  inclement  weather,  GMV  operators should  maintain  proper  tire  inflation,  and  reduce  speed  as  necessary  to  avoid  accidents  and ensure safety on the road. 8.9.1.  Rain.  Most operators slow down or pull-off the road in a heavy downpour.  However, many do not realize that roads are likely to be especially slick just after rain or drizzle begins.  The first few drops of rain should act as danger signals to the safe operator.  96 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 8.9.1.1.  On wet pavements, allow at least two times the normal following distance. 8.9.1.2.  In wet weather, extra caution is necessary on mountain roads.  Rocks, loosened by water seepage, may fall onto the road.  Water beneath the pavement may freeze during a cold snap and cause the pavement to buckle. 8.9.1.2.1.  Operators  may  suddenly  find  broken  pavement  or  rocks  in  their  path  as they round a curve.  Operators rounding a curve should drive slowly and with caution to avoid broken pavement or possible obstructions. 8.9.1.3.  Wet roads may also cause hydroplaning, a condition in which directional control is partially or totally lost as the tires on the vehicle lose traction with the road. 8.9.2.  Snow and Ice.  Roads covered in snow and ice reduce traction, require three to eleven times more stopping distance, and may not be easily identifiable by the operator.  Fresh snow may  conceal  an  icy  road  surface,  or  isolated  patches  of  ice  may  be  on  an  otherwise  clear road, especially in shaded areas.  An operator should use extreme caution to maintain traction to avoid skidding when attempting to stop or turn. 8.9.2.1.  Visibility.  Good visibility is the first requirement for safe driving. 8.9.2.1.1.  Keep  windshields,  windows,  mirrors,  headlights,  spotlights,  and  body clearance lights clean and free of snow and ice. 8.9.2.1.2.  If  defrosters  are  not  available,  keep  windshields  clean  by  using  the windshield wiper, wedging the rear of the hood open so motor heat is vented toward the windshield (for rear-opening hoods) or thoroughly ventilating inside the vehicle. 8.9.2.1.3.  Cover  windshields  of  vehicles  parked  in  open  lots  with  cardboard  or canvas to prevent overnight frosting. 8.9.2.1.4.  Use  low-beam  headlights  to  warn  other  vehicles  when  visibility  is  low.  Stop,  park  off  of  the  road,  and  wait  for  conditions  to  improve  if  there  is  zero visibility. 8.9.2.2.  Operating Procedures. 8.9.2.2.1.  Start  driving  in  second  or  third  gear  rather  than  first  or  low.    Engage  the clutch  gradually  (or  in  D2,  high,  with  automatic  transmission),  and  accelerate  no more than necessary to keep from stalling. 8.9.2.2.2.  Descend  moderate  grades  in  the  gear  normally  used  to  climb  the  same grade.  On steep or very slippery grades, use at least one gear lower and go slower. 8.9.2.2.3.  If  unsure  about  a  difficult  stretch  of  road,  bring  the  vehicle  to  a  stop  and inspect  the  road  carefully  before  going  across.    Select  a  gear  that  can  allow  the vehicle to  pass safely.   If following a vehicle,  wait until  it crosses.  This allows the GMV operator the ability  to  render assistance to the lead vehicle if it  gets stuck.   It also  ensures  that  the  lead  vehicle  may  be  able  to  render  assistance  to  the  second vehicle if it gets stuck. 8.9.2.2.4.  To drive through heavy slush, downshift before entering and keep moving.  If  wheels  begin  to  spin,  disengage  the  clutch  at  once,  back-up,  and  try  again.    If  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 97 necessary  try  rocking  the  vehicle  by  shifting  rapidly  between  forward  and  reverse gears. 8.9.2.2.5.  On  roads  that  slope  toward  side  ditches,  straddle  the  center  or  crown  to avoid sliding to the side.  Watch carefully for approaching traffic. 8.9.2.2.6.  Avoid vehicle tracks, rocks, and other objects that might throw the vehicle sideways causing a skid.  Also avoid sharp turns that may make a vehicle skid. 8.9.2.2.7.  Drive  at  reduced  speeds.    This  allows  the  GMV  operator  to  bring  the vehicle  to  a  stop  more  quickly.    Avoid  quick  acceleration  on  slick  roads  to  avoid skidding. 8.9.2.2.8.  Slow  down  before  coming  to  bridges  and  shaded  places.    Be  especially careful in the late afternoon and at night.  Melting snow running down from the upper side  of  a  banked  curve  may  freeze  on  the  pavement  as  the  sun  sets.    Since  bridges cool much more rapidly than other road surfaces, moisture often condenses on them and freezes quickly into thin sheets of ice when the temperature drops. 8.9.2.2.9.  Give turn signals sooner than usual, and pump the brakes to give others an early warning of the intention to stop.  This gives other operators more time to react.  Note:  If the vehicle is equipped with ABS, do not pump the brakes; hold firm on the brakes. 8.9.2.2.10.  Maintain at least double the normal distance from the vehicle ahead. 8.9.2.2.11.  After  driving  through  slush  or  water,  test  the  brakes  while  moving  at  a reduced speed.  If the brakes do not operate normally, continue at a slow speed while maintaining  moderate  pressure  on  the  brake  pedal  to  create  a  slight  drag.    The  heat generated by friction between the brake shoe and brake drum may dry the brakes. 8.9.2.2.12.  Keep the cab door open when crossing frozen streams.  This ensures that the GMV operator can exit the vehicle if the ice thins and they are in danger of falling through the ice. 8.9.2.3.  Parking. 8.9.2.3.1.  Place  brush,  boards,  or  other  suitable  material  beneath  wheels  when parking  for  an  extended  period  on  wet,  slushy,  or  muddy  surfaces.    This  keeps  the tires from sinking, freezing to the ground, or being “pocketed” in ice. 8.9.2.3.2.  Do not set the parking brake.  During cold weather conditions, applying the parking brake may cause the linings to freeze to the brake drums. 8.9.2.3.3.  Instead, block the wheels and place the transmission in the appropriate gear for parking as directed by the vehicle Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual, TO and/or respective lesson plan. 8.9.2.4.  Vehicle Care. 8.9.2.4.1.  Carbon  Monoxide  Poisoning.    This  poisoning,  from  inhaling  the  exhaust fumes  of  the  vehicle,  usually  results  in  death.    To  avoid  the  possibility  of  inhaling these fumes: 8.9.2.4.1.1.  Never  sleep  in  the  cab  of  the  vehicle  with  the  engine  or  heater  98 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 running.    Whenever  the  heater  is  used  while  driving,  leave  a  window  open slightly. 8.9.2.4.1.2.  Inspect  the  vehicle  exhaust  manifold,  muffler  and  tail  pipe  for serviceability and tightness daily. 8.9.2.4.1.3.  Never  leave  the  engine  running  while  working  on  the  vehicle  in  a closed building. 8.9.2.4.2.  Keep  all  fuel  tanks  and  containers  as  nearly  full  as  possible  to  keep moisture  from  condensing  inside  the  fuel  tanks  and  containers.    Moisture  not  only contaminates the gasoline, but also may freeze in the fuel lines. 8.9.2.4.3.  Drain the air tanks in the vehicle each time it is stopped (long enough for the tanks to become cold).  This procedure reduces the chance of moisture collecting in the tanks, entering the brake lines, freezing, and making the brakes inoperative. 8.9.2.4.4.  On  brief  halts  during  extremely  cold  weather,  let  the  engine  run  at  a  fast idle so that the ammeter shows a charge.  Fast idle results in better burning of fuel and a  more  even  engine  temperature.    On  long  halts,  park  the  vehicle  with  the  rear  end toward the wind to keep snow out of the engine. 8.9.2.4.5.  Under normal operating conditions, stop the engine during brief halts.  This can prevent plug fouling and overheating. 8.9.2.4.6.  When it is very cold, cover the radiator and hood with a tarpaulin or other suitable material. 8.9.2.4.7.  In  severe  cold,  start  the  engine  frequently  between  operating  periods  to keep it warm. 8.9.2.5.  Means of Traction Assistance. 8.9.2.5.1.  When  driving  on  snow  or  ice,  make  sure  the  vehicle  is  equipped  with chains, snow tires, or studded tires. 8.9.2.5.2.  Vehicles  equipped  with  mud  and  snow  tires  can  slide  more  easily  on  icy road  surfaces  than  those  with  commercial  tread.    Mud  and  snow  treads  are  more effective on roads covered with loosely packed snow. 8.9.2.5.3.  All-wheel  drive  vehicles,  without  chains,  generally  perform  better  than two-wheel drive vehicles with chains on rear wheels. 8.9.2.5.4.  Chains give a good bite in snow or mud, but tend to slip and slide on ice and packed snow. 8.9.2.5.5.  Sand,  cinders,  or  dirt  scattered  on  icy  road  surfaces  gives  more  traction than chains. 8.9.2.5.6.  Better traction is gained when the load is distributed evenly on all wheels. 8.9.2.6.  Tire Chains and Tire Chain  Installation.  Chains are designed to creep or move on  the  tires.    Tighten  them  by  hand,  never  with  tools.    Creeping  or  moving  of  chains reduces  the  possibility  of  the  links  gouging  into  the  tires.    When  using  chains continuously, check their fit and condition at each halt.  Install repair links as soon as one  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 99 of the cross chains is broken.  Do the following when installing tire chains under normal conditions: 8.9.2.6.1.  Check  the  condition  of  the  chains.    Eliminate  twists.    On  some  vehicles, tire chains must be installed on all driving wheels.  (T-0).  Check the manufacturer’s operator’s manual, TO and/or respective lesson plan. 8.9.2.6.2.  Drape chains over tires with open ends of cross chain hooks away from the tire and with fasteners on the trailing ends of the side chains. 8.9.2.6.3.  Tuck  the  first  cross  chain  under  the  front  of  the  tire.    Move  the  vehicle forward until the fasteners are hub high. 8.9.2.6.4.  Straighten  and  center  the  chains.    Lift  the  ends  of  the  side  chains  to determine which links may be hooked into the fasteners. 8.9.2.6.5.  If installing on duals, first fasten chains between wheels, then inner chains, and finally the outer chain.  If installing on singles, fasten the inner chain before the outer chain. 8.9.2.6.6.  Do the following when the vehicle is mired: 8.9.2.6.6.1.  Determine  whether  to  install  the  chains  with  a  forward  or  backward wheel motion. 8.9.2.6.6.2.  Check the condition of the chains.  Eliminate twists. 8.9.2.6.6.3.  Drape  chains  over  tires  with  open  ends  of  cross  chain  hooks  away from the tire and with fasteners on the trailing ends of the side chains. 8.9.2.6.6.4.  Locate the first cross chain near mud or snow line.  If the chains are dual,  fold  the  inner  half  of  the  chain  over  top  of  the  outer  half.    This  makes  a doubled chain on the outer wheel.  For this reason, the methods listed below then apply to either dual or single wheels. 8.9.2.6.6.5.  Secure one end of each side chain to the wheel by a strong wire, cord, or chain passed through the opening in the wheel and fasten to the inner and outer side chains adjacent to the first cross chain. 8.9.2.6.6.6.  Pull the chain back to take up slack and align with tire.  To keep the loose chain from one wheel from being caught up by the other, pile it close behind the wheel to which it is secured. 8.9.2.6.6.7.  Revolve  wheels  slowly  to  draw  chains  around  tires.    Stop  when fasteners are at the top of the tires.  Pull side chains up tight to select links to be hooked into fasteners.  Hook the inner side chain first. 8.9.2.6.6.8.  When  the  vehicle  has  been  moved  to  solid  ground,  loosen  and remove  the  temporary  wires,  cords,  or  chains.    Adjust  the  chains  to  their  proper position. 8.9.3.  Fog.  Fog is dangerous at any time, but particularly so at night.  It is possible that fog can be so thick that an operator can barely see the front of the vehicle. 8.9.3.1.  In dense fog, get off the road as quickly as possible.  100 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 8.9.3.2.  Thick fog can collect in small pockets at the bottom of hills on otherwise clear nights.   When running into  one of these pockets, slow down as quickly  as possible and switch to the low-beam headlights. 8.9.3.3.  Once through the fog, continue to drive slowly.  One pocket of fog is usually a warning  that  there  may  be  more  fog  at  the  bottom  of  the  next  hill.    Continue  to  drive slowly until completely out of the fog area. 8.10.  Secondary  Roads.  Secondary  roads,  built  for  local  transportation  and  not  as  main highways, may be hazardous.  The fact that a secondary road is paved does not necessarily mean that it was designed for heavy traffic or regular highway speeds. 8.10.1.  Secondary roads are recognizable by their rectangular route signs. 8.10.2.  An operator who is unfamiliar with one of these roads should be on guard for sudden bends and sharp dips. 8.10.3.  Secondary roads cannot be driven safely at speeds that would be normal on primary highways.  Operators should adjust to a safe speed and adjust their driving and awareness. 8.10.4.  Gravel  roads  are  particularly  dangerous  because  of  their  loose  surface  and  flat (unbanked)  curves.    Stopping  distances  at  all  speeds  are  greater  and  skids  and  spinouts  are more  likely  to  occur.    On  gravel  roads,  keep  the  vehicle  under  tight  control  and  drive  at  a much lower speed than would be safer on a paved road. 8.11.  Overloading and Overcrowding.  No vehicle is safe when it is overloaded or crowded to the  point  that  the  operator’s  normal  vision  of  the  road  is  obstructed  or  they  have  difficulty operating the vehicle. 8.11.1.  Overloading.  Do not use a car as a truck.  A heavy load decreases performance and increases stopping distances.  A heavy load may  also  damage the springs, shock absorbers, tires, and transmission.  A heavy load or one that is not evenly distributed may upset the trim and balance of a vehicle, making curves and stops more dangerous. 8.11.1.1.  Loads on trucks and trailers should be securely fastened to prevent any part of them from falling off.  See Chapter 10 and vehicle specific lesson plan for loading and tie-down instructions. 8.11.2.  Overcrowding.  As a general rule, an operator cannot safely drive if they allow more than three persons, including themselves, in the front seat of a vehicle with the gearshift lever on  the  steering  column,  or  more  than  two  persons  with  the  gearshift  on  the  floor  of  the vehicle.  (In some compact vehicles, the maximum safe limit may be only two, regardless of the position of the gearshift.) 8.11.2.1.  Overcrowding in the back seat (more than three persons) is dangerous because it is likely to interfere with the line of sight from the rearview mirror. 8.11.2.2.  When a vehicle is equipped with seat belts, the number of passengers will not exceed the number of seat belts provided.  (T-0).  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 101 Section 8C—Off-Road Driving 8.12.  General  Information.  Off-road  driving  conditions  present  special  challenges  for  the GMV operator. 8.13.  Off-Road  Driving  Terrain  Types.  The  following  section  discusses  different  types  of terrain  a  GMV operator  may  encounter while driving off-road.  Follow instructions for driving under other than normal conditions.  Driving techniques are different for rear-wheel drive, front-wheel drive, and all-wheel drive vehicles.  Operators of large GMVs should be aware, that due to vehicle weight, the shoulder of the road might give way.  Note:  The operator should first check the vehicle’s manufacturer’s operator’s manual and the respective lesson plan and/or TO for the equipment being operated. 8.13.1.  Ditches. 8.13.1.1.  Crossing  shallow  ditches  requires  shifting  into  low  gear  or  range  and proceeding slowly. 8.13.1.2.  Enter the ditch obliquely so that one wheel leaves the ditch as the other wheel on the same side enters. 8.13.1.3.  When crossing deep ditches, use the lowest forward gear and four-wheel drive if the vehicle is so equipped. 8.13.1.4.  When reaching the bottom, accelerate the motor enough to keep rolling as the vehicle goes up the other side. 8.13.1.5.  If the ditch is deep and has very steep sides, it may be necessary to cut away the tops of the banks before trying to cross. 8.13.2.  Gullies and Ravines.  Gullies and ravines are natural  formations  caused by  running water. 8.13.2.1.  Look over these formations carefully to find a place to cross and to ensure that the vehicle can get across.  Examine both banks. 8.13.2.2.  If water is flowing in the ravine, check its depth. 8.13.2.3.  Put  the vehicle in  low gear and slowly  approach the  ravine at  a right  angle to the edge. 8.13.2.4.  Using  the  service  brake,  ease  the  front  wheels  into  the  gully;  taking  care  to have them strike the bottom at the same time. 8.13.2.5.  Bring  the  engine  up  to  normal  operating  speed  as  the  wheels  hit  the  bottom.  Accelerate enough to climb as the front wheels touch the opposite bank. 8.13.3.  Woods.    Woods  help  to  conceal  the  GMV  operator  and  their  vehicle  from  air observation.  However, woods present  certain problems.   Wooded areas are likely spots for guerrillas, partisans, or enemy troops.  Be alert to the possibility of an ambush. 8.13.3.1.  Fairly  open  woods  with  trees  at  least  as  far  apart  as  the  width  of  the  vehicle may allow passage if the GMV operator can maneuver the vehicle around the trees. 8.13.3.2.  Use an established trail if possible.  102 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 8.13.3.3.  Do not plan to return on the same route because these same saplings may stop or damage the vehicle when braced against it. 8.13.3.4.  If the trees are too dense and prevent passage, drive as closely as possible to the edge of the woods using shadows for concealment. 8.13.4.  Stumps.    A  high  tree  stump,  if  straddled  by  the  vehicle,  can  seriously  damage  the vehicle axles, tires, and other low parts.  Check ground clearances and drive with caution. 8.13.5.  Low  Limbs.    When  driving  through  wooded  areas,  whether  on  country  roads  or cross-country, low hanging limbs may rip the tarp, break the tarp bows or radio antennas. 8.13.5.1.  It is usually best to remove the canvas top and the bows for field operation. 8.13.5.2.  Survey the route to determine if the vehicle can proceed without damage from low-hanging limbs or if it is practicable to remove obstructing limbs. 8.13.6.  Timber.  If necessary, driving over fallen trees is possible if angle crossings cannot be achieved.  By piling  dirt and other materials/debris over the fallen tree, the obstacle can become more level with the path being traveled enabling the GMV operator to pass. 8.13.7.  Rocky Terrain. 8.13.7.1.  Do  not  try  to  straddle  large  boulders;  they  may  damage  axles  and  other  low parts of the vehicle. 8.13.7.2.  Move very slowly when driving in rocky terrain. 8.13.7.3.  If  available,  operators  of  GMVs  should  carry  an  extra  spare  tire  because  the possibility of getting a flat is greatly increased. 8.13.7.4.  Remove stones between dual tires as often as possible to prevent breaking the sidewalls of the tires. 8.13.8.  Mud  and  Swamps.    Every  military  vehicle  has  enough  power  in  its  lowest  gear  to pull out of mud if it gets traction. 8.13.8.1.  Try to pull out slowly in low gear or low range if the vehicle is equipped with an automatic transmission.  Placing boards, brush, or similar material under the vehicle’s wheels can increase traction.  Remember the following: 8.13.8.1.1.  Select the gear that can get the vehicle through.  Roll onto the soft area at a  medium  speed  for  the  selected  gear.    Carefully  maintain  a  steady  throttle  until reaching solid ground. 8.13.8.1.2.  If  stopped  by  mud  rolling  up  in  front  of  the  wheels,  the  GMV  operator may have to back up and try again, this time with increased momentum. 8.13.8.1.3.  Under most conditions, this technique requires prompt action.  Otherwise, the mud  may fill  the tracks behind  the  wheels  and slow or stop  the backing.  There needs to be solid footing within reach of the vehicle in order to do this. 8.13.8.1.4.  If a vehicle with an automatic transmission gets stuck, pull out slowly in low gear or low range. 8.13.8.1.5.  If  the  vehicle  cannot  get  out,  and  if  brush  or  boards  do  not  provide  the traction needed, have another vehicle pull out the stuck vehicle.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 103 8.13.8.1.6.  When other vehicles are not available and the vehicle is equipped with a winch,  attach  the  winch  cable  to  a  tree  or  solid  object  and  pull  the  vehicle  out  with winch power.  Do not rock the vehicle; it may only dig in. 8.13.9.  Streams.  The applicable Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual and lesson plan written for the specific vehicle contain detailed instructions on fording streams.  In addition to those instructions, follow these precautions before fording: 8.13.9.1.  Check the stream bottom to determine how firm it is. 8.13.9.1.1.  If some sinking is expected, determine if this sinking added to the water depth may exceed the vehicle’s fording limit.  If the fording limit may be exceeded, find another crossing point. 8.13.9.2.  After reaching dry land, test the brakes while moving at a reduced speed.  If the brakes do not operate properly, continue at a slow speed while maintaining a light steady pressure  on  the  brake  pedal  to  cause  a  slight  drag  on  them.    The  heat  should  dry  the brakes. 8.13.10.  Sand.    When  driving  in  sand,  never  drive  while  holding  the  inside  of  the  steering wheel.    The  sand  can  grab  the  tires  causing  the  steering  wheel  to  jerk  suddenly  and  cause injury to the operator. 8.13.10.1.  The  main  objective  when  driving  in  sand  is  to  maintain  movement  with  the least  amount  of  strain  on  the  vehicle,  its  engine,  and  its  power  train.    The  GMV operator’s ability to do these things well comes only through experience.  To do this: 8.13.10.1.1.  Estimate if a sandy area is drivable. 8.13.10.1.2.  Adjust the tire pressure to meet changing conditions. 8.13.10.1.3.  Use various aids to improve bearing surfaces. 8.13.10.1.4.  Exercise sound driving techniques. 8.13.10.2.  Accessories.  To help overcome the many difficult conditions associated with extended driving in  sand, the GMV operator should  lubricate and service the vehicle  at more  frequent  intervals  as  specified  by  the  unit  commander.    Also,  the  GMV  operator should be provided with the following: 8.13.10.2.1.  A tire gauge. 8.13.10.2.2.  The means to inflate tires if the vehicle is not so equipped. 8.13.10.2.3.  Spare valve cores. 8.13.10.2.4.  Readily available material for use under wheels in extremely soft areas. 8.13.10.2.5.  Shovels and tow chains or cables. 8.13.10.3.  Sound Driving Techniques for the Sand. 8.13.10.3.1.  Follow normal engine starting procedures. 8.13.10.3.1.1.  Select  a  gear  or  range  that  can  start  to  move  the  vehicle  forward with a minimum of, or no clutch slippage and wheel spinning. 8.13.10.3.1.2.  Accelerate  gradually.    Maintain  a  steady  and  even  rate  of  104 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 movement. 8.13.10.3.1.3.  Avoid  unnecessary  shifting  of  gears.    If  the  vehicle  is  equipped with an automatic transmission, keep it in low range. 8.13.10.3.2.  Anticipate difficult spots and try to bypass them. 8.13.10.3.2.1.  Head  for  a  small  stretch  of  soft  sand  with  increased  speed,  when necessary,  to  take  advantage  of  momentum.    Stop  before  entering  an  extensive stretch of soft sand.  Reduce the tire pressure, if necessary. 8.13.10.3.2.2.  As soon as the need for low tire pressure ceases, stop and re-inflate to appropriate pressure. 8.13.10.3.3.  Approach a dune (hill of sand piled up by the wind) from the windward (most gradual) slope at a 90-degree angle. 8.13.10.3.3.1.  Select the proper gear or range to avoid shifting while on the slope.  Maintain as much momentum as possible while going up the slope. 8.13.10.3.3.2.  Be prepared to change direction upon reaching the crest.  Ride the crest if necessary to seek a safe route. 8.13.10.3.3.3.  If  the  lee  (steepest)  slope  may  be  used,  select  a  point  where  the angle of approach may allow the front bumper to clear. 8.13.10.3.3.4.  Follow  in  the  tracks  of  preceding  vehicles  or  break  a  new  path depending on conditions. 8.13.10.3.3.5.  Make  wide  turns.    Sharp  turns  can  stall  or  even  overturn  the vehicle. 8.13.10.4.  Do the following to stop in sand: 8.13.10.4.1.  Let the vehicle roll to a halt if practicable.  Otherwise, brake gradually.  This prevents tires from digging in. 8.13.10.4.2.  Try  to  stop  on  a  downhill  slope.    This  gives  a  GMV  operator  an advantage when starting. 8.13.10.5.  Freeing Vehicle from the Sand.  At the first sign the vehicle is bogging down, try shifting to a lower gear.  Do the following if it still bogs down: 8.13.10.5.1.  Stop power to the driving wheels.  If a GMV operator continues to use the  motor  to  force  the  vehicle  out  of  the  sand,  it  may  only  sink  deeper  and  become more difficult to get out. 8.13.10.5.2.  Check  tires  for  sand  operation  inflation.    High  temperature  may  have built up the pressure.  Lower the tire pressure, if necessary, for emergency movement over  a  short  distance.    Check  the  applicable  Manufacturer’s  Operator’s  Manual  and respective vehicle lesson plan for the allowable minimum tire pressure. 8.13.10.5.3.  As soon as the need for low tire pressure ceases, stop and re-inflate the tires to the appropriate pressure. 8.13.10.5.4.  If lowered tire pressure is not enough to free the vehicle, use any or all of the following procedures:  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 105 8.13.10.5.4.1.  Shovel a clear path ahead of the wheels. 8.13.10.5.4.2.  Lay  boards,  brush,  canvas,  wire  netting,  rope  ladders,  or  some similar material under and in front of the tires for better flotation and traction. 8.13.10.5.4.3.  Use the winch or a tow if it appears that continued operation of the vehicle under its own power would only cause it to sink deeper into the sand. 8.13.10.5.4.4.  If  a  vehicle  is  stuck  in  sand  and  needs  pulled  out,  unload  the vehicle to the maximum extent possible. 8.13.10.5.4.5.  As soon as the need for low pressure ceases, stop and re-inflate tire to appropriate pressure. 8.14.  Vehicle  Care.  In  addition  to  responsibilities  contained  in  the  respective  Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual and lesson plan.  A GMV operator must do the following:  (T-1). 8.14.1.  Keep valve caps on all tires.  (T-1). 8.14.2.  Check engine temperature and oil pressure frequently.  (T-1). 8.14.3.  Check  for  a  loose  or  broken  fan  belt  if  overheating  occurs.    (T-1).    Correct  as necessary.  (T-1). 8.14.4.  Clean the oil spout before adding oil.  (T-1).  Remove any accumulation of sand or dirt around the filler hole.  (T-1). 8.14.5.  Clean  the  spouts  of  gasoline  containers  before  using  them  for  refueling.    (T-1).  Under extremely dirty conditions, filter gasoline when filling tank. 8.14.6.  Inspect  nuts,  bolts,  springs,  mountings,  and  accessories  frequently  for  evidence  of looseness or damage.  (T-1). 8.14.7.  Park with  the rear of the vehicle toward  the wind when halted overnight  or for any extended period.  (T-1). 8.14.7.1.  If  this  is  not  possible,  cover  the  windshield  and  radiator  with  a  tarpaulin  to prevent  sand  from  accumulating  in  the  engine  compartment  and  damage  to  the windshield.  106 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Chapter 9 ROADSIDE EMERGENCY AND ACCIDENT RESPONSE Section 9A—General Information 9.1.  General  Information.  There  are  some  roadside  emergencies  and  accidents  that  are unavoidable.  However, many times the operator is the cause because they are driving carelessly, driving too fast, not obeying traffic signals or signs, or failing to take proper care of the vehicle.  The  techniques  discussed  in  this  chapter  can  assist  the  GMV  operator  in  avoiding  roadside emergencies and accidents, and can aid in the proper response in the event that an emergency or accident were to occur. Section 9B—Roadside Emergencies 9.2.  Tire  Blowouts.  An  operator  seldom  receives  a  warning  before  a  tire  blowout.    There  is usually a loud bang, and then a whooshing and flapping sound before the vehicle starts swerving to one side or swaying dangerously. 9.2.1.  An  operator  should  use  all  their  strength  on  the  steering  wheel  to  keep  the  vehicle moving  straight  ahead.    Let-off  the  gas  but  do  not  apply  the  brakes.    Let  the  vehicle  slow down gradually and then gently apply the brakes and get the vehicle under control. 9.2.2.  If  in  a  passing  lane  when  a  blowout  occurs,  do  not  attempt  to  get  to  the  highway shoulder until the lanes on the right are clear.  When lanes are clear, move over as far to the right side of the road as safely possible on the shoulder and stop.  If in a jurisdiction where the operator primarily drives on the left side of the road, move over as far to the left side of the road as safely possible on the shoulder and stop. 9.3.  Skids.  Almost all skids can be avoided if driving slowly enough and if the operator stops, starts,  and  turns  slowly  enough  on  slippery  surfaces.    If  the  vehicle  starts  to  skid,  the  operator may  be  able  to  regain  control  if  they  ease  up  slowly  on  the  accelerator  and  do  not  apply  the brakes. 9.3.1.  Always  make  sure  the  vehicle  is  kept  in  gear.    If  the  skid  occurs  when  braking,  the operator  should  remove  his/her  foot  from  the  brake.    It  may  be  necessary  to  feed  gas carefully to  reduce the braking  effect  of the engine.   In either case, the reason for reducing the brake action is to keep the wheels  from slowing down too quickly and making the skid worse. 9.3.2.  At the same time, turn the steering wheel in the direction of the skid (see Figure 9.1.).  If the rear end of the vehicle is skidding to the right, turn the steering wheel to the right.  If it is skidding to the left, turn the steering wheel to the left.  Do not turn the steering wheel too sharply  or  keep  it  turned  too  long  since  this  may  cause  the  vehicle  to  start  skidding  in  the opposite direction. 9.3.3.  Ease the steering wheel back to the center position as the vehicle starts to recover from the skid and regain control of the vehicle.  Let the engine slow the vehicle down gradually.  If the brakes are applied, do not hold the pedal down.  Pump the pedal gently until the vehicle comes to a complete stop.  Figure 9.1. shows how to recover from a skid.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 107 Figure 9.1.  Recovering from a Skid.  9.4.  Running Off the Pavement.  At some point, a vehicle may drift off the roadway onto the shoulder or may been steered onto the shoulder to avoid a collision.  There may be a drop-off of several  inches  from  the  edge  of  the  road  to  the  shoulder.    Pulling-off  onto  the  shoulder  and returning to the roadway can be done safely: 9.4.1.  If the two right or left wheels of the vehicle veer off the paved roadway, keep a firm grip on the steering wheel.  Keep the vehicle traveling straight ahead.  Straddle the edge of the  pavement.    Fight  the  tendency  of  the  wheels  to  pull  toward  soft  shoulders.    Resist  the urge to immediately whip the vehicle back onto the pavement. 9.4.2.  Ease-off  the  accelerator  pedal  so  the  vehicle  can  slow  down.    If  possible,  avoid braking.  If braking is necessary, pump the brakes lightly to help control steering. 9.4.3.  Before returning to the pavement, visually check ahead, to the sides, and to the rear.  Unless some object beside the road poses a serious threat of a collision, avoid trying to return to  the  roadway  immediately.    Move  the  off-road  tires  out  about  one  and  a  half  to  two  feet away  from  the  pavement  edge.    When  it  is  safe  and  speed  is  under  control,  turn  the  wheel quickly  about  a  quarter  turn  to  the  right  or  left  as  necessary.    This  lets  the  tire  climb  the pavement edge and get back on the roadway. 9.4.4.  As soon as the front tires are back on the roadway, counter steer quickly to maintain the proper lane. 9.5.  Brake Failure.  108 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 9.5.1.  If the brakes fail and the failure is not related to engine failure, pump the brake pedal rapidly (if vehicle has hydraulic brakes) to restore braking action long enough to get off the highway. 9.5.2.  If this does not work, apply steady pressure to the parking brake that controls the rear wheels.  Be careful when using the parking brake to stop and be prepared to release the brake if the rear wheels lock.  Reapply the parking brake if needed.  Downshifting the vehicle also serves as a braking force. 9.5.3.  Find an escape ramp or a safe exit from the highway.  Communicate the emergency to other  drivers  by  sounding  the  horn  and  flashing  the  lights.    In  more  extreme  cases,  more severe methods may be required to slow the vehicle.  An operator may have to run along an embankment; scrape against a curve; or drive into bushes, hedges, or other obstructions. 9.6.  Breakdowns.  In the event of a vehicle breakdown, follow these general guidelines: 9.6.1.  Whether  day  or  night,  the  GMV  operator  will  always  turn  on  the  four-way  flasher warning lights.  (T-0). 9.6.2.  Place  warning  devices  contained  in  the  highway  warning  kit  as  prescribed  in  the  kit instructional  manual.    If  the  instructions  are  not  with  the  kit,  follow  the  procedures  in paragraph 9.10. 9.6.3.  Remove  the  vehicle  from  the  main  traveled  portion  of  the  road,  if  possible.    If  it  is impossible to  get  the vehicle off the road  and it is  obstructed from  view by a curve or hill, walk  back  along  the  shoulder  of  the  road  to  a  position  where  it  is  possible  to  signal approaching drivers to stop in time. 9.6.4.  Do not attempt to make repairs on the vehicle while it is in an exposed position on the road. 9.6.5.  For  disabled  vehicles,  GMV  operators  will  notify  Vehicle  Management  and  his/her Unit through his/her chain-of-command.  (T-1). 9.6.6.  Flat tire.  If the vehicle has a flat tire, it is possible to damage the tire beyond repair if the  operator  continues  to  drive  on  it.    The  operator  should  gradually  bring  the  vehicle  to  a stop and, if possible, pull over to the side of the road. Section 9C—Vehicle Fires 9.7.  Preventing  Vehicle  Fires.  There  are  several  means  to  prevent  vehicle  fires.    Below  are some, but not all precautions that should be taken by the GMV operator: 9.7.1.  Refueling.    Turn-off  the  engine  during  refueling.    Do  not  allow  smoking  or  open flames within 50 feet of a vehicle during fueling or at an accident scene where there is danger from spilled gasoline or other flammables.  If tactical refueling, ensure refueling vehicle and customer vehicle are bonded together prior to refueling.  Keep the gasoline nozzle in contact with the gas tank when fueling. 9.7.2.  Flares.  When flares are authorized, issue instructions for their handling and storage on the  vehicle.    Since  flares  are  a  potential  fire  hazard,  it  is  imperative  that  operators  take  the prescribed precautions when handling them.  Ignited flares will not be attached to a vehicle.   AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 109 (T-0).    Further  information  concerning  warning  devices  is  found  in  Chapter  8.    Flares  are prohibited on vehicles transporting explosives or flammable cargo. 9.7.3.  Transporting Flammable Cargo.  Do not allow smoking within 50 feet of the vehicle when transporting explosives or flammable cargo.  Do not allow the vehicle to be exposed to open flames or explosives when it is loaded with flammables or explosives. 9.7.4.  Transporting  Bulk  Flammable  Liquids.    Vehicles  designed  for  transporting  bulk flammable liquids will be permanently marked with warning signs.  (T-0). 9.7.4.1.  When  a  general-purpose  vehicle  is  used  to  transport  liquid  fuels  or  other dangerous cargo, it is the operator’s responsibility to place the prescribed warning signs on  the  vehicle.    When  dispatched  to  transport  dangerous  cargo,  ask  a  supervisor  for special instructions and warning signs for the vehicle. 9.7.4.2.  Title  49  CFR  Part  172,  Hazardous  Materials  Table,  Special  Provisions, Hazardous  Materials  Communications,  Emergency  Response  Information,  Training Requirements,  and  Security  Plans  prescribes  the  warning  placards  for  vehicles transporting hazardous cargo in  the CONUS   When operating overseas, be sure to  have the required warning signs for all the countries in which driving is required. 9.7.4.3.  Take  emergency  measures  provided Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual when bulk fuel transporters develop leaks. the  vehicle’s in lesson  plan  and 9.7.4.4.  When  dispensing  fuel  to  another  vehicle  or  a  tank,  a  ground  cable  must  be secured  to  the  dispensing  vehicle  and  the  vehicle  or  tank  being  filled  (Grounding  and Bonding).  (T-0). 9.8.  Fighting  Vehicle  Fires.  Due to  the limited resources available  for fighting a vehicle fire, send  for  help  from  professional  fire  fighters  when  possible.    Common  firefighting  equipment usually consists of a hand fire extinguisher and any available natural materials (such as sand and water).  Those  resources, when applied at  the start of a  fire, have  a  good chance of bringing  it under control.  However, if the fire is out of control, attempting to extinguish it with inadequate equipment  not  only  diminishes  the  possibility  of  successfully  extinguishing  the  fire,  but  it  also endangers the lives of the operator and others nearby. 9.8.1.  When it is discovered that a vehicle is on fire: Pull the vehicle off-the-road in an open area away from buildings, trees, brush, vehicles, or anything else that might catch fire.  Do not pull into a service station.  Notify the fire and police departments.  Prevent the fire from spreading.    With  an  engine  fire,  turn-off  the  engine  as  soon  as  possible.    Do  not  open  the hood if avoidable. 9.8.2.  Use the correct type of fire extinguisher.  B- and C-rating extinguishers are designed to  work  on  electrical  and  liquid  fires.    The  A,  B,  and  C  type  extinguishers  are  designed  to work on burning wood, paper, and cloth; as well as electrical and liquid fires. 9.8.3.  Know how to use the fire extinguisher.  Stay far away as possible from the fire.  Aim at the source or the base of the fire, not up in the flames.  Take a position upwind from the fire.    This  can  allow  the  wind  to  carry  the  extinguisher  chemicals  to  the  fire,  limiting  the possibility  of  the  flames  coming  towards  you,  causing  harm  and  interfering  with extinguishing  attempts.    Do  not  attempt  to  extinguish  a  fire  if  unfamiliar  with  firefighting techniques and equipment.  110 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 9.8.4.  Cargo fires in trucks and trailers are usually discovered by smell or observing smoke escaping from around doors and/or from under the tarpaulin.  Unless an adequate source of firefighting equipment is available, do not open the cargo doors or remove the tarpaulin until the vehicle has been moved to a safe location where help (preferably from a fire department) can  be  obtained.    After  help  has  been  obtained,  the  doors  may  be  opened  cautiously  or  the tarpaulin  partially  removed  and  the  source  of  the  fire  determined.    It  may  be  necessary  to remove part of the cargo to find the source of the fire. 9.8.5.  Tires  that  are  not  inflated  properly  generate  excessive  heat  during  operation.    This may result in the tires igniting, especially in dual-wheeled vehicles.  Tires dragged along the road  surface  because  of  a  locked  wheel  may  begin  to  burn.    Fires  resulting  from  these conditions  may  be  prevented  by  keeping  the  tires  properly  inflated,  recognizing  any difference  in  the  performance  of  the  vehicle  that  would  indicate  a  locked  wheel,  and promptly  taking  corrective  action.    If  a  tire  does  start  burning,  it  may  not  be  possible  to extinguish  it  with  firefighting  equipment.    However;  further  damage  may  be  prevented  by employing the following measures: 9.8.5.1.  When  possible, attempt  to  extinguish  the  fire  by  covering  it  with  sand,  mud  or water. 9.8.5.2.  When the wheel cannot be safely removed; drive the vehicle into sand, mud, or water and cover any exposed parts with mud or a similar substance. 9.8.5.3.  When  the  fire  cannot  be  controlled  by  the  above  procedures,  use  the  vehicle firefighting equipment or other suitable substance to prevent the fire from spreading.  Do not  attempt  to  transport  a  burned  tire  on  the  vehicle  unless  the  fire  is  completely extinguished and the tire has cooled to normal temperate. Section 9D—Roadside Tool Kits 9.9.  Spare Tire and Tool  Kit:  The operator must ensure that the vehicle is equipped with the proper  tools  in  case  of  an  emergency  breakdown.    (T-1).    The  vehicle  should  have  a  suitable jack, lug wrench, and screwdriver; as well as any additional tools based on conditions (such as bad weather, difficult terrain, warfare, and so forth).  The unit VCO will provide a spare tire, tool kit, and basic issue items (BII) for each vehicle.  (T-1). 9.10.  Highway  Warning  Kit:  This  kit  has  reflectors  that  can  be  used  in  all  cases  where warning is necessary (see Figure 9.2.). 9.10.1.  All  Air  Force  GMVs,  capable  of  carrying  ten  or  more  persons  or  with  a  rated capacity of more than four tons, will be equipped with approved highway warning kits. (T-0).    Vehicles  of  lesser  capacity  that  regularly  operate  over  public  highways  will  also  be equipped  with  warning  kits.    (T-0).    These  kits  stay  with  vehicles  regularly  used  on  public highways.    Additional  kits  are  stored  with  Vehicle  Operations.    The  kits  are  issued  for specific trips when required. 9.10.2.  Convoys will be equipped with one kit for each ten vehicles, with a minimum of two kits per convoy.  (T-1).  Of the total kits, at least one will be carried in the trail vehicle. (T-1).  Instructions for use will accompany each kit when issued.  (T-1).  The unit VCO/VCNO will furnish the highway warning kit IAW AFI 24-301.  (T-1).  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 111 Figure 9.2.  Use of Highway Warning Kits.  9.11.  Use of Highway Warning Kit.  Whenever a vehicle is inoperative or unable to move on a traveled  portion  of  any  highway,  the  following  instructions  will  be  complied  with  immediately (except  in  blackouts  or  within  business  or  residential  districts  where  traffic  conditions  do  not permit or warrant the placing of warning devices):  (T-0). 9.11.1.  Make  every  reasonable  effort  to  move  the  vehicle  from  the  traveled  portion  of  the roadway onto the shoulder if possible. 9.11.2.  When lights are required (sunset to sunrise), place a reflector in the obstructed lane, or on the shoulder of the road if the vehicle is on or over the shoulder, between the vehicle and the approaching traffic using that lane.  Do this before trying to repair the vehicle.  Place the reflectors as follows: 9.11.2.1.  One reflector in the center of the lane of traffic occupied by the vehicle, not less than 40 paces (about 100 feet) from the vehicle in the direction of traffic approaching in that  lane.    If  the  vehicle  is  on  or  over  the  shoulder  and  does  not  occupy  a  traffic  lane, place  the  warning  device  alongside  the  edge  of  the  roadway  to  avoid  obstructing  the traffic lane. 9.11.2.2.  One reflector on the traffic side of the vehicle 4 paces (about 10 feet) to its rear, in the direction of traffic approaching in that lane. 9.11.2.3.  One reflector not less than 40 paces from the vehicle in the opposite direction. 9.11.2.4.  If  the  motor  vehicle  is  stopped  within  300  feet  of  a  curve,  crest  of  a  hill,  or other  obstruction  to  view,  place  one  reflector  no  less  than  40  paces  or  more  than  120 paces from the vehicle to afford ample warning to other highway users. 9.11.2.5.  When  lights  are  not  required  (sunrise  to  sunset),  place  red  flags  or  reflectors with  flags  mounted  on  them  as  prescribed  for  night.    Since  most  warning  kits  contain  112 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 only  two  flags,  the  reflector  placed  20  feet  behind  the  vehicle  will  not  have  a  flag mounted on it.  (T-1). 9.11.3.  A basic vehicle highway warning kit containing three sets of reflectors and two red flags  which are  acceptable in  most states.   Some states also  require items, such as flares in the kit.  However, vehicles transporting compressed gases, explosives, or flammable liquids will  use  three  red  electric  flashing  lanterns  instead  of  flares.    (T-0).    Check  the  kit  and/or additional items periodically to ensure compliance with local legal requirements. Section 9E—Off-Base Repair Service 9.12.  Off-Base Repair Service.  Vehicle Management can furnish local procedures and policies for  the  off-base  area  to  be  served  by  the  installation’s  vehicle  maintenance  crew.    When  the vehicle  needs  service  at  an  off-base  location  and  it  is  too  far  away  to  obtain  practical  vehicle maintenance furnished from the base, proceed according to the instructions below: 9.12.1.  Contact the vehicle’s owning Unit and Vehicle Management to make them aware of the  needed  repair  and  to  gain  additional  guidance  and  coordination  pertaining  to  repair services, dispatch support and vehicle recovery. 9.12.2.  For most minor repair services, use of the government credit card is authorized IAW with AFI 24-302. Section 9F—Accident Response 9.13.  Initial Accident Response Procedures.  If involved in an accident, always stop and assist.  Exception:  The only  possible exception to  this rule might  be in  combat  or in  case of military necessity when operating under definite orders not to stop. 9.13.1.  Assist  in  acquiring  medical  attention  and/or  authorities  for  the  individuals  involved in the accident. 9.13.1.1.  If anyone appears injured, render first aid. 9.13.1.2.  State laws require that police will be summoned to all motor vehicle accidents. (T-0).  The military cooperates with civil authorities that are responsible for investigating all accidents on public highways. 9.13.1.3.  If in an area controlled by armed services police; send for them or ask someone to  do  so.    The  armed  services  police  must  complete  their  own  investigation  of  the accident.  (T-0).  Cooperate and assist them in every way. 9.13.2.  Whenever  practical,  the  GMV  operator  or  assistant  operator  (if  present)  will  report the accident to his/her unit commander using the chain-of-command by telephone as soon as duties at the scene of the accident have been completed.  (T-1). 9.13.3.  Emergency roadside repair involves replacing or repairing automotive accessories at the point of breakdown.  Repair is limited to the guidelines of the region responsible for the installation  Vehicle  Management  and  the  local  installation  policies.    Repairs  of  this  type include  tires,  tubes,  batteries,  and  automotive  accessories.    When  government  facilities  are nearby,  use  them  (if  possible)  instead  of  commercial  facilities.    Vehicle  Management  will normally advise  an operator if a government  facility is  readily available  or if a commercial  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 113 source must be used.  (T-1).  The operator may be held liable for the bill if this procedure is not followed. 9.13.4.  The  person  who  signs  for  a  government  credit  card  is  solely  responsible  for  the control and purchases made with the card.  Credit card purchases must be substantiated with a copy of the service station receipt.  (T-0).  In addition to the information normally shown on  delivery  receipts,  ensure  that  the  speedometer  reading  and  the  registration  (or  license) number of the vehicle and the operator’s name, grade, and organization are put on the receipt.  The receipt must also show the credit card number; date of purchase; name and address of the station; the grade, quantity, and price per gallon of fuel; and the total amount charged.  (T-0).  Upon returning to the base, the operator will return the credit card issued and a copy of any credit card receipts to Vehicle Management.  (T-1).  See Chapter 7 for more information. 9.14.  Precautions  Against  Further  Accidents.  After  a motor vehicle  accident, the vehicle or vehicles  involved  are  frequently  in  dangerous  locations.    Often  a  crowd  assembles  around  the accident. 9.14.1.  To  prevent  additional  accidents,  damage,  or  injury;  be  sure  to  post  guards,  flags, flares, or lights (except in a blackout) to warn all other traffic to proceed with caution. 9.14.2.  If civil or armed forces police are present, they will direct traffic.  (T-0).  If Airmen are present, they should be asked to act as guards. 9.14.3.  Cargo,  glass,  or  other  debris  spilled  on  the  highway  (as  a  result  of  the  accident) should be cleared from the road surface as soon as possible. 9.15.  Removal of Vehicle From Accident Scene. 9.15.1.  Moving the vehicle from the scene of the accident is governed by laws or regulations of the state or area where the accident occurred.  Obtain all the necessary data relating to the accident  before  moving  the  vehicle.    If  possible,  the  GMV  operator  or  passengers  should document (drawing, marking, photographing, or otherwise) the exact position of all vehicles and objects before moving them. Section 9G—Preparation of Accident Forms 9.16.  Preparation of Accident Forms.  The following forms assist in documenting accidents: 9.16.1.  DD  Form  518  (Accident  Identification  Form).    The  purpose  of  the  DD  Form  518 (Figure  9.3.)  is  to  give  any  persons  involved  in  an  accident  all  of  the  information  required from the military operator. 9.16.1.1.  This  form  must  be  filled  out  at  the  scene  of  the  accident  or  as  promptly  as possible  and  given  to  the  person  directly  concerned.    (T-0).    If  the  accident  involves  a parked  vehicle  and  the  person  concerned  is  not  present,  place  the  DD  Form  518  in  the vehicle  or  secure  it  on  the  windshield.    Notify  local  authorities  and  then  stand  by  the scene of the accident for their arrival, if practical. 9.16.1.2.  Disclosure  of  social  security  number  (SSN)  is  voluntary.    No  disciplinary action will be taken in cases where the SSN is not provided.  (T-0). 9.16.2.  SF  Form  91.    Even  though  an  accident  is  minor  or  is  not  the  operator’s  fault,  the operator  must  report  it  so  facts  are  clearly  presented  and  witnesses  are  identified.    (T-0).   114 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 This  protects  the  operator  and  the  government  against  claims  and  exaggerations.    For  the purpose of reporting an accident, use SF Form 91. Figure 9.3.  DD Form 518.  9.16.2.1.  In completing SF Form 91 (Figure 9.4., Figure 9.5., Figure 9.6., Figure 9.7.), keep the following general instructions in mind: 9.16.2.2.  Secure  hard-to-get  facts  first.    The  first  responsibility  of  the  operator,  after ensuring that the vehicle will not cause another accident, is that the injured are cared for, and  other  precautions  are  taken.    (T-1).    The  operator  should  also  get  the  names  and addresses of the people involved in the accident and of all witnesses.  If this is not done promptly, it may be impossible to later get the information. 9.16.2.3.  Do  not  leave  the  scene  of  the  accident  until  all  pertinent  facts  concerning  the accident have been obtained.  This information should include the following: 9.16.2.3.1.  Condition of the road. 9.16.2.3.2.  Position of the vehicles. 9.16.2.3.3.  Amount of damage involved. 9.16.2.3.4.  Any other information that may be relevant, but difficult to remember at a later time.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 115 9.16.2.4.  After  obtaining  the  information  required  for  the  report  that  may  include information  from  others,  the  operator  should  complete  the  sections  of  the  SF  Form  91.  Be exact.  Be sure the report gives a clear picture of what actually happened. 9.16.2.4.1.  If  another  vehicle  is  involved,  the  operator’s  diagram  of  the  accident should show exactly  where the vehicles were before  and after the crash  and exactly what obstacles blocked either driver’s view. 9.16.2.4.2.  Every name should be spelled correctly and every street address listed by number.    On  highways  where  there  are  no  house  numbers,  use  mileage  markers, power line or telephone pole numbers, or intersecting roads to pinpoint the location of the accident. 9.16.2.4.3.  State  the  visible  damage  (for  example,  crushed  right  rear  wheel,  bent  or broken axle, crumpled fender, and so on).  If a party claims that damage has occurred, but it is not visible to the operator, a note indicating this should be made. 9.16.2.4.4.  Follow the same procedures with injuries.  If an injury is visible, write it down.    If  the  injured  party  claims  an  injury  that  is  not  visible,  make  a  note  of  the injured party’s complaint. 9.16.2.4.5.  If  it  is  not  possible  to  obtain  the  exact  information  on  an  item,  write “unknown.”  If there is a section that does not pertain to the accident, write “N/A” or “NONE.”    Make  an  entry  in  every  blank,  to  assure  the  reviewer  that  nothing  was overlooked. 9.16.2.5.  Never  express  an  opinion  (either  orally  or  in  writing)  to  claimants  or  their agents concerning liability, investigation findings, or the possibility of claim approval. 9.16.2.6.  If  more  space  is  needed,  use  a  separate  sheet  of  paper  to  answer  a  question.  Write “see attached” in the space by the question on the report and attach the extra sheet securely to the report form. 9.16.2.7.  Check  each  item.    As  an  agent  for  the  United  States  government,  it  is  the operator’s  responsibility  to  ensure  that  all  information  is  obtained  and  is  accurate.    If provided  information  does  not  seem  legitimate,  do  not  hesitate  to  further  question  the other driver. 9.16.2.8.  Any  employee  of  a  federal  agency  who  fails  to  accurately  report  a  motor vehicle accident involving a federal vehicle may be subject to administrative action.  116 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Figure 9.4.

This  form  must  be filled out  at the scene of the  accident  or as promptly  as possible and given to the person directly concerned.  (T-0).  If the accident involves a parked vehicle and the person concerned is not present, place the SF 94 in the vehicle or secure it on the windshield.  Notify local authorities and then stand by the scene of the accident for their arrival, if practical.  See Figure 9.8.   120 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Figure 9.8.  SF Form 94.   AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 121 Chapter 10 LOADING AND TIE-DOWN PROCEDURES Section 10A—Loading and Tie-down Procedures General Information 10.1.  General  Information.  This  chapter  covers  the  general  aspects  of  transporting  various types  of  cargo  with  military  vehicles.    It  does  not  cover  every  configuration  of  loading  cargo. Within  CONUS  units  must  adhere  to  local,  state  and  interstate  laws  and  regulations.    Within foreign countries, host nation guidelines/restrictions must be complied with. (T-0).  For overseas combat theaters  of  operation,  combatant  commanders  must  consider  host  nations guidelines/restrictions when developing movement criteria for cargo.  (T-0).  For more detailed information on loading and tie-down procedures and required compliance, refer to DTR 4500.9-R Part II, Cargo Movement and Surface Deployment and Distribution Command Transportation Engineering Agency (SDDCTEA) Pamphlet 55-20, Tie-down Handbook for Truck Movements. Section 10B—Cargo Responsibility and Distribution 10.2.  Responsibility  for  Cargo.  The  operator  should  help  load  his/her  vehicle  to  ensure  that load is properly secured to avoid damage during movement.  The operator is responsible for the cargo from the loading point to receipt at destination. 10.2.1.  Inspect all cargo loaded in the vehicle. 10.2.2.  Be sure that its weight  does not  exceed the vehicle’s  capacity  and that it is  secured against falling or shifting. 10.2.3.  Shippers must ensure they have adequate chains, cables, or special tools required to secure a load when blocking, bracing, or banding.  (T-0). 10.2.4.  After the load has been secured to the vehicle, recheck security before covering the load.  This may prevent shifting or loss of load en-route. 10.2.5.  The operator covers the load with the tarpaulin and lashes the tarpaulin in place. 10.2.6.  Protection Against the Weather.  Use the sides, tailgate, tarpaulin, curtains, and ropes on the vehicle whenever needed to protect the load from rain, snow, sun, sand, or dust.  Draw tarpaulins tight over the bows or sides.  Tie them down to the proper cleats with the tie-down ropes, using two half hitches. 10.2.6.1.  If  properly  tied  down  the  canvas  should  look  neat  and  be  free  from  wrinkles and bulges. 10.2.6.2.  If improperly placed on the vehicle, the canvas develops rubbed spots and tears that could reduce the tarpaulin’s effectiveness and may damage the cargo. 10.2.6.3.  If  the  canvas  is  not  in  use,  it  should  be  folded,  stored,  and  secured  during transport.  However, to prevent mold and mildew,  the canvas should not be stored if it is wet.  As soon as practicable after the job is done, spread out the wet canvas and let it dry before storing it.  122 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 10.2.7.  Protect  Against  Pilferage.    When  cargo  is  protected  against  the  weather,  it  is  also protected,  to  a  degree,  against  pilferage.    However,  a  GMV  operator  must  stay  constantly aware  of  this  danger.    (T-0).    Keeping  close  watch  of  people  approaching  the  vehicle provides the best protection.  Loads may be pilfered while moving, as well as while halted.  If the cargo is particularly valuable or if operating in an area where theft is common, armed guards may be assigned to assist with transporting the cargo. 10.2.8.  Protection  Against  Casual  Observation.    When  cargo  is  protected  against  the weather, it is  also  protected against casual  observation.  Security for sensitive loads is  very important in a tactical situation.  If the enemy is unable to identify a high-priority target that the  vehicle  is  carrying,  chances  of  mission  success  have  just  been  significantly  improved.  Operators  of  GMVs  should  strive  to  constantly  improve  on  concealing  the  identity  of  their cargo  in  a  threat  environment.    Load  lashing  and  camouflage  screens  can  be  used  for  this purpose. 10.3.  Distribution  of  Cargo.  The distribution of cargo definitely bears on the life of the tires, axles,  frame,  and  other  vehicle  parts.    Although  a  vehicle  may  not  be  overloaded  beyond  its weight  capacity,  individual  tires  and  axles  may  still  be  overloaded  due  to  faulty  cargo distribution (see Figure 10.1., Figure 10.2. and Figure 10.3.). 10.3.1.  Learn the capacity of any vehicle assigned to operate before leaving the dispatcher’s office.  No vehicle should be loaded beyond its rated capacity without written authority from supervision.  Operators can usually get the weight of the load from the shipping agency.  If in doubt about the weight of special loads, contact supervision for instructions before moving. 10.3.2.  Warning, the operator must be sure the vehicle parking brake is set and wheel chocks are placed under the rear wheels to prevent any forward or rearward movement of the vehicle during loading or unloading.  (T-0).  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 123 Figure 10.1.  Load Distribution.   124 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Figure 10.2.  Load Distribution (Continued). Figure 10.3.  Load Distribution (continued).   10.4.  Loading  and  Tie-down  Safety.  Safety  is  everyone’s  responsibility.    The  operator  must receive  adequate  instruction  on  safe  practices  when  vehicles  are  operated.    (T-0).    Safety, properly  taught  and  constantly  emphasized,  prevents  much  needless  manpower  and  equipment loss  during  critical  military  operations.    Refer  to  AFI  91-203  and  AFI  91-207  to  define  safety responsibility.  A few of the safety hazards associated with vehicle loads that should be avoided are as follows: 10.4.1.  Loading heavy loads on top of lighter loads.  This may cause damage to both the load and vehicle  and may  cause the vehicle to  overturn easily during movement  due to  a higher center-of-gravity. 10.4.2.  Stacking load on vehicle beyond recommended limits (too high).  Depending on the weight, this may cause the vehicle to overturn or loss of load from low overpasses.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 125 10.4.3.  Unbalanced  loads.    This  may  prematurely  cause  undue  wear  or  failure  of  vehicle components and cause degradation of vehicle control. 10.4.4.  Failure to recheck load security en-route.  Loads may shift during movement causing loss of load or a vehicle accident. 10.4.5.  Incompatible load.  Certain ammunition/explosive types are not compatible and must not be transported together.  (T-0).  Failure to comply may cause an explosion or fire. 10.4.6.  Using inadequate or unserviceable tie-down devices.  Failure to ensure the integrity of  the  tie-down  equipment  may  result  in  loss  of  load,  a  vehicle  accident,  and  injury  to personnel. 10.4.7.  Using  inadequate  lifting  devices.    This  may  cause  damage  to  lifting  device  and  or injury to personnel when attempting to lift loads that exceed the maximum capacity. 10.4.8.  Personnel under a suspended load.  This violation may cause serious injury or death to personnel if load falls. 10.4.9.  Controlling a suspended load.  Failure to comply may cause suspended load to swing uncontrollably into vehicle or personnel causing injury or damage. 10.4.10.  Smoking or open flame during refueling.  Failure to comply with no smoking rules may cause serious injury or death to personnel or destruction of vehicle and loads. 10.4.11.  Driving too fast with loaded vehicle.  Despite recommended speeds being posted on roadways, a loaded vehicle may require even slower speeds.  Failure to comply may result in an overturned vehicle and injury to personnel. 10.4.12.  Damage to load due to improper tie-down.  This may cause damage to the load and tie-down  materials  from  sharp  edges.    Over  tightening  straps  may  crush  certain  palletized loads. 10.4.13.  Failure  to  properly  placard  a  vehicle  carrying  hazardous  cargo.    In  the  case  of  an accident this may prevent local emergency crews or recovery personnel from determining the hazard posed by spilled cargo and summoning appropriate aid. 10.5.  Vehicle  Safety  Standards.  These  vehicle  safety  standards  are  applicable  to  loading  and tie-down.  Before vehicle dispatch, the chain-of-command should ensure that operators perform before,  during  and  after  operational  checks  to  prevent  the  following:  A  non-mission-ready vehicle,  improperly  secured  loads,  vehicle  loaded  beyond  design  load  limits,  unsafe transportation of personnel. 10.6.  Types of Loads.  Cargo can come in most any configuration.  The GMV operator may be required to move cargo that is configured in one or more ways.  Examples are listed below. 10.6.1.  Bulk cargo is defined as cargo that is not packaged in bundles or containers. 10.6.2.  Palletized cargo is defined as cargo that has been placed on a standardized platform for shipment.  In the Air Force’s case, the standard platform is the 463L pallet.  Cargo may be shipped on wooden shipping pallets as well. 10.6.3.  Vehicle  payload  is  defined  as  a  tracked  or  wheeled  vehicle  being  transported  on  a wheeled vehicle or semitrailer to its destination.  126 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 10.6.4.  Passenger cargo is defined as transporting personnel, with or without equipment, in a vehicle designed to accommodate such a load with installed troop seating and safety device. 10.6.5.  Containerized load is defined as containers that are placed on semitrailers so that the weight of the load is spread evenly over the trailer bed. 10.7.  Special  Loads.  When  transporting  a  load  that  extends  beyond  the  sides  or  more  than  4 feet beyond the front or rear, mark the part of the load that extends beyond the truck body with red flags (measuring not less than 12 inches square) in daytime and with red lights at night.  On loads  extending  one-third  or  more  the  length  of  the  cargo  bed,  determine  if  a  special  permit  is required as explained below. 10.8.  Load Compatibility. 10.8.1.  For  certain  ammunition  and  explosives,  compatibility  standards  must  be  strictly enforced.   (T-0).  When ammunition,  in  either commercial or military conveyance, is  to  be transported  along  or  across  roads  accessible  to  the  public,  DoT  compatibility  rules  shall apply.  (T-0).  For more information, see 49 CFR Parts 171-179, Highways and Railways, 49 CFR Parts 390-397, Federal  Motor  Carriers, and OSHA 1926.902, Surface Transportation of Explosives. 10.8.2.  When ammunition is transported along or across roads that are not accessible to the public  or  roads  that  are  clearly  posted  as  prohibited  to  the  public,  ammunition  may  be transported according to the stowage compatibility chart.  For more information, see 49 CFR 173.52,  Classification  Codes  and  Compatibility Groups  of  Explosives,  and  49  CFR  175.78, Stowage Compatibility of Cargo. 10.8.3.  When ammunition is  transported in  the training area on the installation, by Airmen on a training exercise using tactical vehicles, the vehicles may transport a mix of ammunition similar  to  that  the  vehicles  would  carry  in  combat,  provided  the  vehicles  do  not  cross  or move along a route accessible to the general public. 10.8.4.  Incompatible  loads  may  be  transported  on  public  roads  during  times  of  war, contingency  operations  (not  contingency  exercises)  or  declared  national  emergencies  when DoT-Special Permit (SP) 3498 has been invoked and the shipper complies with all provisions of that exemption (see 49 CFR 175.78). 10.9.  Load Configuration. 10.9.1.  Vertical  Height  of  Load.    When  vehicles  are  loaded  with  substantial  weight concentrated high  above the ground, the possibility of a high  center of  gravity exists.  This situation becomes critical when trying to drive around a corner or make a short-radius turn at too  great  a  speed.    When  this  occurs,  centrifugal  force,  which  is  always  present  in  turns, joined by the high center of gravity point, results in an increased tendency of the load to tip over.  To preclude this and possible damage to the vehicle and cargo: 10.9.1.1.  Load the heaviest items on the bottom of the vehicle. 10.9.1.2.  Avoid stacking heavy items too high. 10.9.1.3.  Slow the vehicle before turning and watch and listen for possible load shifting. 10.9.2.  Oversize  and  Overweight  Cargo.    Before  operating  a  truck  or  trailer  loaded  with unusually heavy or odd-size loads, check with the operator to determine if the load is within  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 127 state and local laws limiting load weight and dimensions on public highways.  The operator must  arrange  to  obtain  special  permits  before  moving  oversize  or  overweight  vehicles  on public highways.  (T-0).  Refer to the SDDCTEA, Highways for National Defense program for questions, concerns or assistance. (http://www.sddc.army.mil/sites/TEA/Functions/SpecialAssistant/Pages/HighwaysNationalDefense.aspx.). 10.9.3.  Over-height.    When  transporting  a  load  that  exceeds  13.5  feet  in  height  from  the ground, the operator must request  clearance and  permits to  transport the load.   (T-0).  This gives the operator route guidance that is safe for movement. 10.9.3.1.  Operators  should  be  issued  a  25-foot  tape  measure  or  telescoping  ruler  to measure from the highest point of the load to the ground and from side-to-side for width.  Units  can  fabricate  a  “telltale”  or  “bangbar”  to  determine  height  before  vehicle’s departure.    Units  should  consider  fabricating  one  for  deployment  away  from  their installation. 10.9.3.2.  The chain-of-command must always anticipate that a load may be picked up at a receiving point or remote loading area, such as a port or terminal that does not have a method of verifying the load’s height, width, or weight.  (T-1). 10.9.3.3.  If a chance of this occurs, the chain-of-command must develop clear guidelines for the operator to report exceeding dimensions.  (T-1). 10.9.3.4.  Do  not  move  the  load  if  uncertain  of  its  oversize  dimensions.    It  is  highly recommended  that  units  assign  assistant  operators  to  aid  in  this  determination  and movement of “oversized loads through tight spots.” 10.9.4.  Overhead  Clearance.    Know  the  overhead  clearance  of  the  vehicle.    Signs  on  most overpasses indicate the clearance in feet and inches.  When transporting an unusual load, if not  completely  sure  of  the  clearance,  drive  very  slowly  when  approaching  the  underpass allowing  enough  time  to  stop  if  the  load  or  vehicle  cannot  clear.    Be  aware  of  other  low hanging objects, such as electrical wires, traffic lights, and tree limbs. 10.10.  Perishable  Cargo.  Perishable cargo normally  consists of fresh foods.  Prompt delivery is  essential.    Vehicles  that  transport  fresh  consumable  items  must  be  kept  clean  and  free  from contamination and odors.  (T-0). 10.11.  Types of Tie-down Devices.  Tie-down devices used to secure cargo to vehicles, trailers, and  semitrailers  can  be  dangerous  if  mishandled.    Before  use,  inspect  all  items  to  ensure  their integrity  and  replace  as  necessary  any  item  that  is  deemed  unserviceable.    Tie-down  materials may come in any one of the following configurations. 10.11.1.  Chains and loadbinders. 10.11.2.  Wire rope and turnbuckles. 10.11.3.  Wire rope and cable clamps (U-bolts). 10.11.4.  Wire rope with chain hoist and cable grippers. 10.11.5.  Web style ratchet and strap assemblies. 10.11.6.  Steel banding with crimp joints.  128 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 10.12.  Loadbinders.  Loadbinders come in four types (see Figure 10.4.). 10.12.1.  The  ratchet  loadbinder  can  achieve  significantly  greater  tie-down  forces  than  the other types of loadbinders.  Of the loadbinders shown, the ratchet and type IV are safest. 10.12.2.  Other  types  of  loadbinders  may  spring  back  with  great  force  upon  release.    See SDDCTEA Pamphlet for further details on loadbinders. 10.12.3.  Turnbuckles may be used in the absence of loadbinders.  See paragraph 10.16. for further  details  in  the  use  of  turnbuckles.    Securing  a  load  with  this  equipment  is  discussed later in this chapter under “Securing the Load.” 10.12.4.  Be careful when releasing type  I, II, and IV loadbinders.  Stay clear of the swing-path of the loadbinder handle. 10.13.  Chains.  Chains used in the tie-down of cargo come in 7/16, 3/8, 1/2, and 3/4 inch sizes.  Table 10.1. depicts detailed information concerning each size. Table 10.1.  Chain Characteristics.

Types of Loadbinders. 10.14.  Wire Rope.  If chains are not available, wire may be used.  10.14.1.  Wire rope comes in 1/4”, 3/8”, 1/2”, and 5/8” sizes depending on the load weight.  Wire rope is rated in nominal strength; actual strength may vary. 10.14.2.  When  wire  rope  is  assembled  in  a  complete  loop  using  wire  rope  clamps,  the strength should be calculated as 80 percent of twice the value of the nominal strength.  With an  end  loop,  the  strength  should  be  calculated  as  80  percent  of  the  wire  rope  (see  Figure 10.5. and Table 10.2.).  130 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Figure 10.5.  Wire Rope. 10.15.  U-Bolts  (Clamps).  These  devices  go  on  the  dead  end  of  wire  rope  because  the  U-bolt introduces a stress concentration that may weaken the wire rope.  The saddle has a large surface and does not cause this type of damage.  The clamps are applied with U-bolt near the end of rope limiting damage to the less critical part of the rope (see Figure 10.6.).  Figure 10.6.  U-Clamps.  10.15.1.  If a torque wrench is not available, adequate torque can be attained by: 10.15.1.1.  For 3/8-inch  clamps, use 12-inch-long wrench and apply  a force of about  50 pounds. 10.15.1.2.  For 1/2-inch clamps, use a 15-inch-long wrench and apply a force of about 60 pounds.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 131 10.15.1.3.  For 5/8-inch  clamps, use a 24-inch-long wrench and apply  force of about  70 pounds. 10.15.1.4.  See Table 10.2. for characteristics of wire rope. Table 10.2.  Wire Rope Characteristics.

Turnbuckles.  Turnbuckles  can  be  used  to  properly  apply  tension  to  wire  rope.  Turnbuckles  can  also  be  used  with  chains  if  loadbinders  are  not  available.    Turnbuckles  with jaws and/or eyes should be used.  Hook end turnbuckles are not recommended because they are weaker than a jaw or eye turnbuckles of the same size (see Figure 10.7.). Figure 10.7.  Turnbuckle Types.    10.17.  Chain-Hoist  and  Cable  Grippers.  Instead  of  a  turnbuckle,  a  chain  hoist  and  cable grippers may be used to tension the wire rope attached to the payload vehicles.  Be sure that at least 24 inches of wire rope are available on either side of the intersection point to allow proper application of cable clamps.  Also, be sure proper tension of wire rope exists.  Tension wire rope  132 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 to  allow  no  more  than  1-inch  of  deflection  when  supporting  the  weight  of  a  200-pound  person (see Figure 10.8.). 10.18.  Web-Style Ratchet and Strap Assemblies.  Web straps are easy to use to secure boxes and pallets for transport.  NSN 1670-00-725-1437 and NSN 5340-01-204-3009 are rated at 5,000 pounds (see Figure 10.9.). 10.18.1.  When using web straps to  secure loads  on pallets,  padding may  need to  be placed between the load and the hooks to prevent the hooks from damaging the load.  Figure 10.10. and  Figure  10.11.  show  typical  loads  secured  to  the  cargo  bed  of  the  vehicle  with  straps.  Steel banding is used to secure the items together. Figure 10.8.  Cable Grippers and Chain Hoist. Figure 10.9.  Web-Style Strap and Ratchet Assemblies.    AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 133 Figure 10.10.  Strap-Secured Load. Figure 10.11.  Strap or Banded Load.    134 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 10.19.  Steel  Banding.  Steel  banding  is  an  effective  way  to  secure  a  load  for  transport,  if  the equipment to tighten and crimp the bands is available.  This type of banding can be used for all modes of transport. 10.19.1.  Rail  transport  is  the  only  mode  that  has  specific  requirements  for  steel  bands  and crimping  the  bands.    If  the  band  requirements  meet  rail  transport  they  will  not  have  to  be changed during truck transport.  (T-0).  See Figure 10.12. for the types of crimps approved for rail transport and appropriate for highway transport. 10.19.2.  The  railroad  banding  requirements  generally  reflect  proper  band  application  as developed by the Association of American Railroads and labeled as required.  The banding suppliers should be aware of these requirements.  Figure 10.13. shows a typical load secured to a cargo bed of a vehicle. 10.19.3.  Blocking  is  typically  used  to  prevent  the  load  from  moving  longitudinally  and laterally.    Steel  banding  is  also  good  for  binding  together  several  items  with  identical dimensions without blocking.  Blocking may be nailed directly to wood deck semitrailers or it  must  be  against  the  end  and  side  walls  of  the  cargo  vehicle  to  prevent  it  from  shifting during transport.  (T-0). Figure 10.12.  Crimp Type Joints.   AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 135 Figure 10.13.  Load  Secured by Steel Banding. 10.20.  Inspection of the Load.  It is imperative that the load be inspected prior to loading and during  transport.    If  the  load  is  palletized  or  pre-configured  for  combat  missions,  the  emphasis should be placed on compatibility of items loaded together and the integrity of the overall load.  10.20.1.  Check for obvious damage to the load and leakage from fluid containers.  Leakage from  petroleum-based  products  can  significantly  degrade  the  integrity  of  nylons-type  web-straps.    If  this  type  of  leakage  is  present,  then  consideration  should  be  made  as  to removal/replacement of leaking container and possibly any contaminated web-straps. 10.20.2.  See  inspection  of  tie-down  equipment  in  next  section  for  detailed  inspection criteria. 10.20.3.  Check  to  ensure  boxes,  crates,  or  other  containers  have  not  been  damaged  or positioned as to allow for damage during transport.  Preconfigured loads such as those loaded onto flatracks undergo severe tilting during loading and unloading. 10.20.4.  Ensure  the  load  is  secured  to  the  flatracks  in  such  a  manner  that  the  load  is  not unbalanced causing and unsafe condition during loading or transport. 10.20.5.  Loads that are not preconfigured or already palletized, such as crates, loose boxes, or un-palletized ammunition should be loaded in a manner that considers load compatibility, weight, balance, and outside dimensions. 10.20.6.  If the load has shifted during transport the operator must take actions to correct the problem prior to regaining movement.  (T-0). 10.20.7.  If  any  unsafe  load  condition  exists  see supervision  for  disposition  of  load  prior  to loading and transport. 10.20.8.  Hazardous Cargo to be transported on payload vehicles for air transport by the Air Force  should  conform  to  guidelines/restrictions  found  in  AFMAN  24-204,  Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments. 10.21.  Inspection of Tie-down Equipment. 10.21.1.  Webstrap Assemblies.  Before each use, straps should be inspected for burns, tears, punctures, cuts,  caustic  damage, oil or  grease contamination,  and frayed  or broken stitches.  Also,  their  metal  parts  should  be  inspected  for  improper  operation,  corrosion,  cracks,  or distortion.  If any of these conditions exist, the tie-down should be replaced.  They should not  136 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 be used for any mode of transport if they have been damaged.  No strength testing of straps will be made.  (T-0). 10.21.2.  Loadbinders.  Visual inspection of loadbinders consists of examining, noticing the defect,  and  classifying  the  defect  as  major  or  minor  (see  Table  10.3.).    If  the  defect  is classified as major, refer defect to supervisor for disposition.  When in doubt, do not use. Table 10.3.  Loadbinder Inspection Criteria.

It  is  vitally  important  to  ensure  that  proper  preparations  are made to ensure a safe transfer of the load to and from the load-carrying vehicle.  MHE is used for this  purpose.    Many  tactical  vehicles  come  equipped  with  such  equipment  to  load  and  unload cargo  without  the  need  of  additional  fork  lift  trucks  or  cranes  on  site.    Prior  to  lifting  and transferring a load, the vehicle and the MHE must be inspected to ensure a safe operation.  (T-0).  Refer  to  vehicle  Manufacturer’s  Operator’s  Manual  and  respective  lesson  plan  written  for inspection  criteria  for  both  the  vehicle  and  the  MHE.    As  with  any  operation  of  this  type, transferring a load can be a dangerous operation.  Consider the following points for a safe load transfer operation: 10.22.1.  Ensure the load itself is prepared for movement by: 10.22.1.1.  If palletized, ensuring pallet is intact and cargo net is secured properly.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 137 10.22.1.2.  If  not  palletized,  ensuring  web  strapping  is  securely  holding  the  contents together for shipment. 10.22.1.3.  Attach guide ropes to control load during transfer. 10.22.1.4.  Prepare  MHE  for  operation.    Refer  to  vehicle  or  Manufacturer’s  Operator’s Manual,  TO  and  respective  lesson  plan  written  for  details  on  equipment  setup  and emplacement. 10.22.1.5.  Determine  who  is  to  direct  the  transfer  and  ensure  all  participants  are informed.    Inform  MHE  operator  that  if  any  hand  signal  is  obscured  or  not  clearly understood, to stop movement of load. 10.22.1.6.  Designate  guide  rope  handlers  and  ensure  they  all  know  where  the  load  is being transferred to. 10.22.1.7.  Ensure  all  participants  clearly  understand  all  hand  and  arm  signals  required for a safe operation.  Misunderstood signals  could spell disaster when moving heavy or dangerous cargo. 10.22.1.8.  Ensure  personnel  not  involved  in  transfer  of  load  to  move  to  a  safe  location out of the way. 10.22.1.9.  Position cargo on load-carrying vehicle according to established load plans for type and amount of load.  If ammunition or explosives are involved, ensure compatibility standards are not violated. 10.22.1.10.  DO NOT allow personnel to stand or walk under a suspended load.  Failure to  comply  may  result  in  death  or  serious  injury  if  the  load  should  fall.    Ensure  load  is under  total  control  during  transfer.    Failure  to  comply  may  result  in  death  or  serious injury to personnel from an uncontrolled, swinging load. 10.22.1.11.  DO NOT allow anyone to stand or walk between moving load and sides of vehicles  where  they  could  become  pinned.    Failure  to  comply  may  result  in  death  or serious injury 10.23.  Blocking and Bracing.  Blocking and bracing may be necessary on certain types of loads or  partial  loads.    This  usually  applies  in  partial  loading  of  cargo  vehicles  or  semitrailers.  Blocking and bracing may be accomplished by the shipping element or the unit depending on the load  or  mission.    Since  the  GMV  operator  is  responsible  for  delivering  the  load  intact,  being knowledgeable of how to block and brace a load becomes necessary. 10.23.1.  Generally, bulk cargo is shipped as palletized loads thus minimizing or eliminating the need for blocking and bracing for truck movements.  However, certain unpalletized loads such  as  55-gallon  barrels  of  lubricants  may  be  shipped  individually  and  should  be  blocked and braced for safe transport (see Figure 10.14. and Figure 10.15.).  138 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Figure 10.14.  Bracing a Load of Barrels. Figure 10.15.  Load Arrangement of Ammunition.   10.24.  General Rules for Blocking and Bracing.  It is important to properly secure the load to ensure safe arrival of cargo.  Here are some general steps in blocking and bracing. 10.24.1.  Block crates, boxes, and barrels to keep them from shifting en-route. 10.24.2.  Use crib blocking whenever possible.  It need not be nailed to the floor or sides if placed tightly against the cargo to reduce damage to the floor and sideboards of the vehicle. 10.24.3.  If  a  gap  exists  between  pipes  or  lumber  and  the  end  of  the  trailer,  block  the  load with a gate constructed with 4 by 4 inch boards to prevent it from slipping.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 139 10.24.4.  All lumber used for blocking must be free of knots and strong enough to provide a rigid and stable support for the load en-route.  (T-0). 10.25.  Securing possible platform/configurations.  However, it can cover commonly used platform/configurations. the  Load.  This section does not cover all load 10.25.1.  Generally, the load is evenly distributed within the cargo area.  Ensure that vehicle load  is  configured  and  distributed  so  that  it  produces  as  low  a  profile  as  possible.    This reduces  the  vertical  center-of-gravity  thus  decreasing  the  chances  of  vehicle  rollover  on rough  terrain  or  if  the  load  shifts  during  movement.    An  additional  benefit  of  keeping  the load center-of-gravity low is the ability to avoid overhead obstacles along the route. 10.26.  Using Web Straps.  When tie-down straps are attached to cargo and to vehicle tie-down fittings,  each  strap  must  be  tensioned  to  form  at  least  1  1/2  turns  on  the  take-up  spool  of  the tensioning ratchet.  (T-0). 10.26.1.  The  1  1/2  turns  must  take  place  after  webbing-to-webbing  contact.    (T-0).    To prevent movement of the cargo, each tie-down must be tightened until about equal tension is applied throughout the tie-down arrangement.  (T-0). 10.26.2.  After tensioning is  completed, the take-up spool locking latch  must be checked to ensure that it is fully seated at both ends of the spool in the matching locking notches.  (T-0). 10.26.3.  The scuff sleeve may have to be removed to allow tightening of tie-downs.  Secure the loose ends of straps by suitable means. 10.27.  Chains and Loadbinders.  When chains and loadbinders are used to secure the load onto the  vehicle  cargo  bed,  flatrack,  or  semitrailer  bed,  special  considerations  must  be  made  with respect to applying and releasing tension to the loadbinders.  (T-0).  Use of cheater bars to gain a mechanical advantage may cause serious injury to personnel.  For this reason the use of a cheater bar to apply tension to a loadbinder is not recommended. 10.28.  Load  Lashing.  Load  lashing  is  used  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  the  load  from inclement  weather  and  from  casual  observation  and  should  not  be  confused  with  the  efforts  to secure the load to the vehicle.  Lashing is done once the load has been secured properly using the proper tie-down materials. 10.28.1.  The vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer involved usually comes issued with a canvas and tarpaulin  with  ropes  to  secure  during  movement.    The  operator  must  ensure  their  loads  are lashed properly in order to provide the maximum amount of protection from the weather (see Figure 10.16.).  (T-0).  140 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Figure 10.16.  Load Lashing.  10.28.2.  If the tarpaulin and rope has not been issued with the vehicle, the operator needs to obtain  two  60-  to  70-foot  lengths  of  3/8-inch  rope  can  usually  be  enough  to  secure  the tarpaulin (For short bed 2 ½-5-ton cargo trucks).  Use the following procedure: 10.28.2.1.  Fasten the end of one rope to one of the front lash hooks or rings (A1). 10.28.2.2.  Pass the rope diagonally across the top of the load through or under the second rope support on the opposite side (A2).  Pull the rope tight. 10.28.2.3.  Pass the rope diagonally back across the top of the load through or under the third rope support (A3).  Pull the rope tight. 10.28.2.4.  Continue this process until the rear of the vehicle is reached.  Secure the rope. 10.28.2.5.  Repeat the entire process with the second rope, starting at the front lash hook or ring (B1).  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 141 Chapter 11 DANGEROUS/HAZARDOUS CARGO AND MATERIALS Section 11A—Transporting Dangerous/Hazardous Cargo 11.1.  General  Information.  Transporting  dangerous/hazardous  cargo  is  perhaps  the  most demanding job a military GMV operator may ever perform.  Much of the cargo that trucks move is  dangerous,  delicate,  or  awkward.    It  may  be  explosive,  radioactive,  sensitive  to  shock,  or simply oversize or overweight.  All hazardous material must be in compliance with CFR Title 49 (See  Parts  100-185).    (T-0).    All  military  oversize,  overweight,  or  special  movements  must  be IAW  DoD  DTR  4500.9-R  Part  II.    (T-0).    Also,  comply  with  additional  hazardous  shipping instruction  guidance  (International  Air  Transport  Association  (IATA)  Dangerous  Goods Regulation  (DGR),  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO),  International  Maritime Dangerous  Goods  (IMDG),  etc.).    See  lesson  plan  on  transporting  hazardous  material  for additional requirements and guidance. 11.2.  Necessary Forms.  Various forms are necessary for transporting special cargo.  The GMV operator must keep these forms safely on board the vehicle when transporting special cargo. (T-0).    Although  the  operator  does  not  need  to  fill  out  any  of  the  following  forms,  they  must  be familiar with their purpose and where they need to be signed:  (T-0). 11.2.1.  DD Form 2890, DOD Multimodal Dangerous Goods Declaration (see Figure 11.1. and Figure 11.2.). 11.2.2.  DD  Form  626,  Motor  Vehicle  Inspection  (Transporting  Hazardous  Materials)  (see Figure 11.3, Figure 11.4, and Figure 11.5.). Section 11B—General Safety Measures 11.3.  General Safety Measures.  Observe these safety measures when dealing with HAZMAT: 11.3.1.  Establish  a  training  program  (AFI  32-7086,  Hazardous  Materials Management)  for loading, unloading, and handling HAZMAT.  Be sure each person involved in the operation is familiar with its contents. 11.3.2.  When handling explosives or flammable materials: 11.3.2.1.  See CFR Title 49. 11.3.2.2.  Prohibit  smoking  except  in  an  established  smoking  area  and  provide  facilities for  safe  disposal  of  smoking  materials.    Prohibit  matches,  lighters,  or  other  sparking  or open-flame producing items in the hazardous area. 11.3.2.3.  Do  not  allow  smoking  within  50  feet  of  the  vehicle  during  loading  and unloading or while the vehicle is moving. 11.3.2.4.  Prohibit  footwear  strengthened  with  nails  or  other  spark-producing  metal, unless the footwear is covered with rubber, leather, or other non-sparking material.  142 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 11.3.2.5.  Establish  firefighting  and  other  emergency  plans  and  provide  for  firefighting and  other  emergency  equipment.    Carry  the  prescribed  number  and  type  of  serviceable fire extinguishers. 11.3.2.6.  Avoid jars or shocks, particularly with sensitive explosives used in detonators.  Subject nuclear weapons to minimum handling and minimum exposure to shock. 11.3.3.  Ensure  that  protective  clothing  and/or  equipment  must  be  used  during  handling  of toxic oxidizers, fuels, or chemical agents.  (T-0).  This may include masks, goggles, gloves, or  other  garments.    Suitable  neutralizing  agents  should  be  available  for  personnel  handling toxic gases, etiologic agents, and white phosphorus. 11.3.4.  Always  have  a  protective  mask  and  protective  ointment  kit  in  the  vehicle  when carrying chemical ammunition. 11.3.5.  Keep personnel clear of loads being lifted by terminal or marshaling yard equipment. 11.3.6.  Keep roadways and marshaling yard aisles in good repair to minimize the danger of toppling container-bearing transporters. Section 11C—Rules for Transporting Dangerous/Hazardous Cargo 11.4.  Rules  for  Transporting  Dangerous/Hazardous  Cargo.  In  addition  to  the  rules  that apply to general cargo, the following general rules apply to most dangerous/hazardous cargo (see also  local  law,  CFR  Title  49  and  DoD  DTR  4500.9-R  Part  II  for  detailed  standards  of  moving this type of cargo): 11.4.1.  Inspect  vehicles  that  carry  dangerous/hazardous  cargo  according  to  DD  Form  626.  The  inspector  checks  to  see  that  the  vehicle  can  be  operated  safely  and  is  free  of  grease accumulations that can cause a fire. 11.4.2.  Inspect  gasoline  cans  for  leaks.    Do  not  permit  defective  cans  to  be  loaded.  Keep gasoline cans, whether full or empty, tightly closed. 11.4.3.  Remove tarpaulins from gasoline cans unless otherwise instructed.  If tarpaulins are used, air and dry them before folding and storing. 11.4.4.  Once  the  vehicle  passes  inspection,  attach  the  proper  warning  placards  (if  tactical situation  permits)  to  the  vehicle’s  front,  rear,  and  sides  to  identify  its  cargo  (see  Figure 11.6.).  Use bilingual placards of the HN when OCONUS. 11.4.5.  When loading and unloading, the GMV operator must:  (T-0). 11.4.5.1.  Provide qualified supervisors to direct  and control the loading, unloading, and handling of HAZMAT.  Supervisors should thoroughly understand the hazards involved and should indoctrinate subordinates on special precautions and emergency situations that may arise. 11.4.5.2.  Set the vehicle’s parking brakes. 11.4.5.3.  Chock  at  least  one  wheel.    Chock  the  semitrailer  when  separated  from  the tractor. 11.4.5.4.  Handle cargo with care and avoid overloading.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 143 11.4.5.5.  Keep the engine turned off during loading and unloading, unless it is providing power to the vehicle accessories used to load or unload. 11.4.5.6.  Load un-palletized shells with their sides parallel to the vehicle body. 11.4.5.7.  Secure the load against shifting. 11.4.5.8.  Post the appropriate placards on the front, rear, and both sides of the vehicle. 11.4.6.  Designate  specific  segregated  areas  for  container  re-stowing  activities,  if  available, and for in-transit storage purposes.  (T-0). 11.4.7.  HAZMAT  operating  and  storage  areas  must  be  marked  with  appropriate  warning signs.  (T-0). 11.4.8.  When appropriate, initiate security measures to prevent theft, sabotage, and so forth.  (T-0). 11.4.9.  When driving with dangerous/hazardous cargo: 11.4.9.1.  Avoid sudden stops and turns. 11.4.9.2.  Do not smoke inside the vehicle. 11.4.9.3.  Do not enter tunnels, if prohibited by local law. 11.4.9.4.  Maintain safe distances from other traffic. 11.4.9.5.  Under  normal  driving  conditions  on  an  open  highway,  the  safe  following distance for trucks, tractor and semitrailer combinations, and similar vehicles is 300 feet daytime and 500 feet nighttime.  Increase the following distance in adverse weather and under  other  poor  driving  conditions.    Check  with  local  authorities  for  the  required minimum following distance. 11.4.9.6.  Never  park  a  vehicle  loaded  with  hazardous  cargo  overnight  in  or  near  a building or a populated area.  144 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Figure 11.1.

A  motor  vehicle,  which  contains  HAZMAT,  should  avoid  routes through  or  near  the  following:    Heavily  populated  areas,  places  where  crowds  are  assembled, tunnels, narrow streets, or alleys.  (T-0).  Follow approved routes IAW CFR Title 49, DoD DTR 4500.9-R Part II, state and local laws for HAZMAT transportation.  (T-0). 11.6.  Operator  Responsibilities.  Except  as  provided  below,  the  GMV  operator  or  another individual  qualified  to  operate  the  vehicle  must  stay  with  a  motor  vehicle  at  all  times  which contains  Class  A  or  Class  B  explosives.    (T-0).    The  GMV  operator  must  attend  to  a  motor vehicle which contains HAZMAT other than Class A or Class B explosives and which is located on  a  public  street  or  highway.    (T-0).    However,  the  vehicle  need  not  be  attended  while  its operator is performing duties that are incident and necessary to their duties as the operator of the vehicle. Section 11D—Load Custody 11.7.  Load  Custody.  A motor vehicle is attended when the person in  charge of it is  awake in the vehicle (not in the sleeper berth) or is within 100 feet of it and has an unobstructed field of view of it. 11.7.1.  A qualified representative of the unit will meet all of the following criteria:  (T-0). 11.7.1.1.  The unit has designated them to attend the vehicle. 11.7.1.2.  They are aware of the nature of the HAZMAT contained in the vehicle. 11.7.1.3.  They have been instructed on the procedures to follow in emergencies. 11.7.1.4.  They are authorized and have the ability to move the vehicle. 11.7.1.5.  They are HAZMAT certified. 11.8.  Parking.  A  safe  haven  is  an  area  specifically  approved  (in  writing)  by  local,  state,  or federal  governmental  authorities  for  the  parking  of  unattended  vehicles  containing  Class  A  or  150 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Class  B  explosives.    A motor  vehicle  that  contains  Class  A  or  Class  B explosives  must  not  be parked under any of these circumstances:  (T-0). 11.8.1.  On or within five feet of the traveled portion of a public street or highway. 11.8.2.  On  private  property  (including  premises  of  a  fueling  or  eating  facility)  without  the knowledge and consent  of the person who is in charge of the property and who is aware of the nature of the HAZMAT the vehicle contains. 11.8.3.  Within 300 feet of a bridge, tunnel, dwelling, building, or place where people work, congregate, or assemble except for brief periods when the necessities of operation require the vehicle to be parked and make it impracticable to park the vehicle in any other place. 11.9.  Missiles:  Missiles  are  very  different  from  most  items  the  Air  Force  transports  because they  can  be  at  the  same  time  overweight,  sensitive,  and  flammable.    These  complex characteristics call for special loading procedures. 11.10.  Ammunition  and  Explosives:  Air  Force  GMVs  often  transport  ammunition  and explosives.    Although  safety  is  always  important,  it  is  especially  so  when  the  cargo  itself  is dangerous. 11.10.1.  A  vehicle  carrying  explosives  must  be  equipped  with  two  fully  charged  dry chemical fire extinguishers.  (T-0).  One of them must be mounted on the outside of the cab on  the  GMV  operator’s  side;  the  other  mounted  inside  the  cab  IAW  Title  49  CFR  Subpart 393.95.  (T-0). 11.10.1.1.  All fire extinguishers must be inspected monthly to make sure they have not been damaged and the hose nozzles are not clogged.  (T-0).  The inspection date and the initials or name of the inspector must be recorded and kept on file.   (T-0).  Methods of recording  vary  by  state.    Check  state  regulations,  local  and  military  fire  station  for compliance standards.   IAW the National  Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) 10,  Standard for  Portable  Fire  Extinguisher,  where  manual  inspections  are  conducted,  records  for manual inspections shall be kept on a tag or label attached to the fire extinguisher, on an inspection checklist maintained on file, or by an electronic method.  If using a tag, the tag must be attached to the extinguisher.  (T-0).  Another tag, indicating the date of the last weight-test, must also be attached to the extinguisher.  (T-0).  The inspection is recorded on the appropriate AF Form 1800. 11.10.1.2.  Block  and  brace  the  load  well  to  prevent  its  shifting  during  travel.    Comply with  applicable HAZMAT shipping instructions (i.e., Title 49 CFR, IATA DGR,  ICAO IMDG, etc.) 11.10.1.3.  Be sure that detonating caps (for such explosives as dynamite) are not carried in  the  same  vehicle  as  the  explosives.    While  loading  or  unloading,  handle  explosives with care. 11.10.1.4.  The  truck’s  tailboard  or  tailgate  must  be  closed  and  secured  to  be  sure  all ammunition or explosives stay inside the cargo compartment.  (T-0). 11.11.  Chemical  Agents:  Federal  agencies  govern  and  regulate  the  transport  of  hazardous chemicals  and  related  items  within  the  US.    A  brief  summary  of  the  regulations  and  safety standards to be used to load and unload this kind of cargo follows:  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 151 11.11.1.  The Vehicle.  The cargo compartment of the vehicle must be a closed body or one covered  with  a  fire  resistant  tarpaulin.    (T-0).    The  vehicle  must  be  equipped  with  red lanterns, red reflectors, red cloths, and two fire extinguishers for use in emergencies.  (T-0). 11.11.2.  Loading and Unloading Safely.  In addition to those precautions already explained, securely  load  containers  with  valves  or  fittings  to  prevent  damage  to  the  valves  or  fittings during transit.  Once unloaded, vehicles should be swept clean.  The sides and floors should be tested for contamination and decontaminated, if necessary. 11.11.3.  GMV  Operator  Instructions.    Each  operator  of  a  GMV  transporting  dangerous chemicals  must  be  given  full  and  complete  information  about  the  shipment  to  help  them safely  deliver  the  cargo  to  its  destination.    (T-0).    When  the  vehicle  is  loaded,  the  GMV operator is informed of necessary safety precautions both verbally and in writing, using DD Form 2890. Section 11E—Transporting HAZMAT by Highway 11.12.  Transporting  HAZMAT  by  Highway.  Because  the  transportation  of  ammunition, explosives,  flammables,  chemical  agents,  and  radioactive  materials  is  dangerous,  it  is  essential that personnel involved know and observe applicable safety regulations. 11.12.1.  A  vehicle  transporting  Class  A  or  Class  B  ammunition,  explosives,  or  other HAZMAT is inspected at the following: 11.12.1.1.  The  origin  of  shipment.    At  this  time,  deficiencies  are  corrected  before  the transporter enters a sensitive area. 11.12.1.2.  At trailer transfer points (when prime movers are exchanged). 11.12.1.3.  At destination, before delivery is accepted. 11.12.2.  DD  Form  626.    In  CONUS,  the  shipper  uses  DD  Form  626  (see  Figure  11.3., Figure  11.4.  and  Figure  11.5.)  as  a  guide  and  record  of  the  inspection.    In  an  overseas theater, DD Form 626 (modified appropriately) may be used or may serve as a model for a locally produced inspection form. 11.12.3.  In  CONUS,  military  shippers  use  DD  Form  2890  (see  Figure  11.1.  and  Figure 11.2.) to instruct GMV operators of military and commercial vehicles transporting dangerous material.    Sections  of  the  form  outline  actions  to  be  taken  in  case  of  fire,  accident,  and breakdown.    The  form  also  provides  for  entry  of  specific  information  by  the  shipper  or transportation officer.  This  form  (appropriately  modified) may also  be used in  an overseas theater or may serve as a model for a locally produced instruction form.  The GMV operator must  have  shipping  papers  available  at  all  times  (see  Title  49  CFR  177.817,  Shipping Papers).  (T-0). Section 11F—Detecting Fuel Leakage Occurring On a Public Highway 11.13.  Detecting  Fuel  Leakage  Occurring  On  a  Public  Highway.  Do  the  following immediately, upon detecting a fuel leak in the cargo tank: 11.13.1.  Turn off the vehicle’s electrical system. 11.13.2.  Extinguish any cigarettes or open flames in the vicinity.  152 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 11.13.3.  Remove the vehicle’s fire extinguisher from its bracket and keep it close at hand.  If an  assistant  GMV  operator  or  other  person  is  available,  tell  him/her  to  man  the  fire extinguisher. 11.13.4.  Notify police of the hazardous situation by the most expeditious means. 11.13.5.  Inspect  the  leak.    Determine  if  a  field  expedient  (for  example,  a  wooden  plug  or rubber matting) can be used to control the leak. 11.13.6.  Place highway warning devices at prescribed locations.  Do not use flares. 11.13.7.  Keep  spectators  away  from  areas  where  flammable  liquids  are  spilled  or  toxic fumes have accumulated. 11.13.7.1.  Guard  against  smoking  by  spectators  or  passing  motorists.    If  personnel  are available, post guards to warn passing operators of the fire hazard. 11.13.7.2.  Notify nearby residents when spillage may place them in danger. 11.13.8.  When civilian police and/or firefighting personnel arrive, tell them the nature of the cargo. 11.13.8.1.  Follow  instructions  issued  by  fire  or  police  department  personnel  until  the hazard is neutralized. 11.13.8.2.  Military  personnel  will  inform  civilian  investigators  and  cooperate  with civilian authorities in clearing the damaged equipment from the highway.  (T-0). Section 11G—Detecting Fuel Leakage Occurring Off the Road 11.14.  Detecting Fuel  Leakage Occurring Off the Road.  When traveling off road, check for leaks at all stops. The movement from the bumps could jar something loose and cause a leak. 11.14.1.  Emergency Procedures.  Do the following immediately upon detecting a leak in the cargo tank: 11.14.1.1.  Turn off the vehicle’s electrical system. 11.14.1.2.  If the tanker is a semitrailer, lower the landing legs, disconnect the semitrailer from the tractor, and drive the tractor a safe distance from the semitrailer. 11.14.1.3.  Remove  the  vehicle  fire  extinguisher  from  its  bracket  and  keep  it  close  at hand.  If an assistant GMV operator or other person is available, tell him/her to man the fire extinguisher. 11.14.1.4.  Inspect the leak.  Determine if a field expedient (for example, a wooden plug or rubber matting) can be used to control the leak. 11.14.1.5.  If  space  is  available  in  another  compartment  of  the  tanker,  transfer  the  fuel from  the  leaking  compartment  to  the  secure  one.    However,  this  procedure  is  not recommended when fumes have accumulated around the tanker pump. 11.14.2.  Fuel  Jettisoning.    When  fuel  cannot  be  transferred  from  the  leaking  compartment, contact the nearest HAZMAT protection facility (local fire station) for permission to locate a proper location to jettison fuel.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 153 11.14.2.1.  Air Force, Department of Defense, and Federal regulations prohibit discharge of fuel on the ground. 11.15.  Petroleum  Tank  Vehicles  Safety  Procedures  .    Whenever  operating  a  tank  vehicle, there are vital safety precautions and procedures that every operator must know and follow.  (T-0).    If  using  petroleum  tank  vehicles,  know  and  observe  the  safety  precautions  and  procedures found in the Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual and respective vehicle lesson plan.  154 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Chapter 12 OPERATION OF MOTOR VEHICLES ON MILITARY FLIGHTLINES Section 12A—Operation of Motor Vehicles on Military Flightlines General Information 12.1.  General Information.  Motor vehicles operating on the flightline are necessary to normal operations and maintenance.  However, they present a clear and possible danger to aircraft and ground  personnel.    Carelessness,  haste,  and  disregard  of  existing  safety  standards  by  GMV operators  on  the  flightline  are  inexcusable  and  are  primary  sources  of  aircraft  collisions  and personnel injury.  This chapter discusses applicable directives covering flightline vehicle traffic. 12.2.  Definition.  For  the  purpose  of  this  chapter,  the  term  “flightline”  includes  runways, taxiways, and aircraft parking ramps, hangars and associated maintenance/servicing areas where aircraft may be encountered, excluding aircraft on permanent static display.  Refer to AFI 13-213 for further instructions and Air Force unique operations. Section 12B—Operation of Motor Vehicles on Military Flightlines Procedures 12.3.  Authorizations. 12.3.1.  Only  GMV  operators  and  vehicles  designated  by  the  installation  chief  of  airfield management,  as  prescribed  in  AFI  13-213  will  be  given  access  to  the  flightline.    (T-1).  Before driving on the flightline, GMV operators will be:  (T-0). 12.3.1.1.  Given  special  instructions  on  standard  flightline  traffic  controls  and  tower signals. 12.3.1.2.  Advised of the particular hazards involved. 12.3.1.3.  Tested to ensure the instructions are understood. 12.3.2.  GMV  operators  will  complete  local  flightline  GMV  operators’  familiarization training and possess proper documentation authorizing flightline driving. (T-1). 12.3.2.1.  The  individual’s  commander  will  ensure  that  the  individual  has  attended  the flightline driving familiarization program.  (T-1). 12.3.2.2.  Certification of completion will be entered on the GMV operator’s record, AF Form 483, Certificate of Competency.  (T-1). 12.3.3.  No  other  person  will  be  allowed  to  operate  a  vehicle  on  the  flightline  except  for specified  short  periods  and  only  by  temporary  written  permission  and  instruction  of  the installation chief of airfield management as prescribed in AFI 13-213.  (T-1). 12.3.3.1.  Permits  for  driving  on  flightlines  will  be  kept  to  a  minimum,  consistent  with operations requirements.  (T-1). 12.3.4.  GMV  operators  performing  on-the-job  training  (OJT)  for  flightline  duties  will  not operate  a  vehicle  within  50  feet  of  aircraft.    (T-0).    This  restriction  does  not  apply  to  the following: 12.3.4.1.  Firefighting vehicles and equipment.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 155 12.3.4.2.  OJT operators who are towing aircraft. 12.3.4.3.  Loading/unloading MHE. 12.3.4.4.  Aircraft-servicing vehicles. 12.3.5.  In  all cases, GMV operators on OJT must be qualified to  operate  the vehicle  and a qualified instructor must accompany them.  (T-0). 12.4.  Flightline Safety Precautions. 12.4.1.  Foreign  Object  Damage  (FOD).    All  personnel  entering  the  flightline  area  will conduct  a  FOD  check  on  their  vehicles  prior  to  entering  these  areas.    (T-0).    These  simple FOD-prevention measures can avoid millions of dollars and hundreds of man-hours to repair or replace the damage to military aircraft. Units must adhere to local host installation’s safety of circle procedures.  (T-1).  A FOD check will, at a minimum, consist of the following:  (T-0). 12.4.1.1.  Inspect the vehicle tires (pull forward to check tire in contact with pavement).  (T-0). 12.4.1.2.  Ensure all external vehicle components are secured.  (T-0). 12.4.1.3.  Secure any/all items loaded on payload vehicle, to include all tie-down device loose  ends  such  as  chains,  ropes,  packaging  or  other  item  that  may  become  dislodged during movement while on the flightline area.  (T-0). 12.4.1.4.  A  thorough  walk  around  of  the  vehicle  to  check  for  damaged,  loose,  or  worn parts.  (T-0). 12.4.2.  In addition, operators will: 12.4.2.1.  Make every attempt to stay on paved surfaces.  (T-1). 12.4.2.2.  Avoid driving on the dirt or grass.  (T-1). 12.4.2.3.  Check  tires  for  FOD  after  returning  to  pavement  if  driving  on  unimproved surfaces  is  required  (for  example,  to  avoid  taxiing  aircraft  or  if  performing  runway repairs).  (T-1). 12.4.3.  Careful  attention  and  strict  adherence  to  flightline  safety  precautions  can  prevent accidental  damage  to  aircraft  and  possible  injury  to  flight  and  ground  personnel.    Bicycle operators  on  the  flightline  will  also  conform  to  these  measures.    (T-0).    Observe  the following precautions at all times when operating vehicles on the flightline. 12.4.3.1.  Do  not  drive  vehicles  within  10  feet  of  a  parked  aircraft  (except  when  the aircraft is being serviced, loaded, or off-loaded). 12.4.3.2.  Use spotters to guide the vehicle’s approach to the aircraft. 12.4.3.3.  Never drive vehicles under any part of the aircraft. 12.4.3.4.  Do  not  back  or  drive  vehicles  forward  directly  toward  any  aircraft  (except  as authorized in certain loading, unloading, or fueling operations). 12.4.3.5.  In these cases, place pre-positioned wheel chocks between the aircraft and the approaching vehicle to keep vehicles from striking the aircraft.  156 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 12.4.3.6.  Post guides as a required safety measure. 12.4.3.7.  Keep  chocks  in  position  until  vehicles  leave  from  within  the  10-foot  safety distance requirement. 12.4.3.8.  Do not point vehicles directly toward an aircraft when parked on the flightline.  All vehicles must approach parked aircraft with the GMV operator’s side of the vehicle toward the aircraft.  (T-0). 12.4.3.9.  Chock all powered vehicles and all equipment mounted on wheels that do not have an integral braking system when left unattended on the flightline. 12.4.3.10.  Leave  vehicles  unlocked  with  keys  in  the  ignition  when  parked  on  the flightline. 12.4.3.11.  For maximum  safety, do not  park or drive any vehicle closer than 25 feet  in front or 200 feet to the rear of any aircraft when engines are operating or are about to be started.  Vehicles parked at the side of the aircraft will be located clear of the wing tips and  will  be  clearly  visible  to  personnel  in  the  aircraft  cockpit.    (T-0).    Aerial  Port personnel will follow Engine Running Onload/Offload (ERO) procedures and limitations outlined in AMCI24-101, Volume 11, Cargo and Mail Policy.  (T-0). 12.4.3.12.  Under no circumstances will vehicles be positioned in front of, or drive into, the  path  of  taxiing  aircraft  except  “guide”  or  “follow  me”  vehicles.    (T-1).    No  vehicle will be driven between the aircraft and the “follow me” guide.  (T-1). 12.4.3.13.  GMV  operators  must  be  particularly  cautious  when  driving  across  runways.  They will completely stop at the runway hold-line (two yellow parallel stripes painted on the taxiway surface).  (T-0). 12.4.3.14.  This marking is normally at least 100 feet from the runway edge.  Installation airfield management officers will annually survey vehicle runway crossing procedures to ensure that flight safety is not being compromised.  (T-1). 12.4.3.14.1.  If conditions at runway crossing require further safety measures; traffic signals, electrically controlled from the tower, will be installed.  (T-0). 12.4.3.14.2.  All  flightline  vehicles  will  fully  stop  before  they  enter  or  cross  a runway/taxiway.    (T-0).    Before  proceeding,  the  GMV  operator  will  determine visually that the way is clear.  (T-0). 12.4.3.14.3.  Vehicles  on  the  flightline  are  a  major  source  of  foreign  objects  that damage aircraft tires and are ingested into jet engines with disastrous results. 12.4.3.14.4.  Before  airfield  operations,  GMV  operators  will  ensure  all  equipment carried on vehicles is properly stowed and secured and the vehicles are inspected for objects that could damage aircraft.  (T-0). 12.4.3.14.5.  When  dual-wheeled  vehicles  are  operated  on  unpaved  surfaces,  they frequently pick up rocks between the tires.  GMV operators will stop when reaching the  airfield  pavement  and  remove  any  rocks  that  are  wedged  between  the  tires  or treads.  (T-0).  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 157 12.4.3.14.6.  A serious mishap potential exists when vehicles are operated in the path of  radio  beams  used  for  aircraft  navigation.    GMV  operators  operating  on  the flightline  will  be  instructed  on  the  location  and  necessary  precautions  to  be  taken when operating near such equipment.  (T-1). 12.4.3.14.7.  General-purpose  vehicles  will  not  tow  compressors,  auxiliary  power units, and similar equipment unless properly equipped with hitches designed for that purpose.  (T-0). 12.4.3.14.8.  Tugs or other vehicles with suitable trailer hitches will normally be used.  (T-0). 12.4.3.14.9.  Equipment will never be towed faster than 15 mph.  (T-1). 12.4.3.14.10.  Safety  chains  will  not  be  required  on  aerospace  ground  equipment (AGE).  (T-1). 12.4.3.14.11.  Pintle  hook  safety  pins  will  be  used  in  all  pintle  hook  towing operations.  (T-0). 12.4.3.14.12.  Vehicle  and  wheeled  equipment,  that  do  not  have  integral  braking systems, will have a rear wheel chocked both fore and aft when parked within 25 feet of any aircraft.  (T-1). 12.4.4.  Vehicle  Flightline  Speeds.    Except  in  unusual  places,  general-purpose  vehicles  will not operate at a speed greater than 15 mph while on the fight line.  (T-1). 12.4.4.1.  Special purpose vehicles will not exceed 10 mph.  (T-1). 12.4.4.2.  No vehicle will operate in excess of 5 mph when near aircraft.  (T-1). 12.4.4.3.  Aircraft will not be towed at speeds greater than 5 mph at any time.  (T-1). 12.4.4.4.  During  emergencies,  fire  and  crash  equipment  and  ambulances  may  exceed speed limits with prudence only when personnel and property are not endangered. 12.4.4.5.  GMV operators will stop when emergency vehicles are seen or heard.  (T-0). 12.4.5.  Headlights, Parking Lights and Flashers.  (T-3). 12.4.5.1.  Headlights  shining  toward  a  moving  aircraft  at  night  are  to  be  turned  off immediately so the pilot is not blinded and the pilot’s night vision is not affected. 12.4.5.2.  The vehicle’s parking lights will be turned on so its position will be known. (T-3).  The headlights should remain off until the aircraft is out of range. 12.4.5.3.  During hours of darkness or inclement weather, all motor vehicles normally use emergency  warning  flashers  (directional  lights  front  and  rear)  when  parked  on  the airfield’s aircraft movement areas. 12.4.6.  Passengers. 12.4.6.1.  Passengers will remain seated while the vehicle is moving and keep their arms and legs within the vehicle body.  (T-0). 12.4.6.2.  Passengers will not ride on tugs or towing vehicles unless a suitable seat with back and side guard is installed.  (T-0).  158 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 12.4.6.3.  They will not ride on any part of moving equipment not designed especially for passengers.  (T-0). 12.4.6.4.  Passenger-carrying vehicles will stop only at the side of aircraft when actually loading or unloading personnel.  (T-1). 12.4.6.5.  It is the GMV operator’s duty to ensure that all passengers abide by these rules and that passenger safety is ensured. 12.4.7.  When the GMV operator’s seat  is  vacated, turn off the ignition,  set  the brakes, and place the gear lever in  reverse  gear.  Set  the gear lever in  park if the vehicle has automatic transmission. 12.4.8.  Use chocks to secure all vehicles and wheeled equipment that do not have an integral braking system when they are left parked unattended on the aircraft parking ramp. 12.4.9.  Aircraft-servicing  support  vehicles  that  require  the  vehicle  engine  to  operate  as  the power source for auxiliary components may be left unattended while the engine is running. 12.4.10.  Emergency  vehicles  that  must  remain  in  operation  at  the  scene  of  an  emergency may be parked with the engine running, the parking brake set, the transmission in neutral or park, and the rear wheels chocked when the operator’s seat is not occupied.  (T-0). 12.4.11.  AGE-towing vehicles may be placed in neutral and left running while the operator completes hookup and delivery operations.  This facilitates movement of the vehicle by hand to align pintle and tongue during hookup operation; and move the vehicle upon detaching the tow tongue from the pintle hook during delivery operations of heavy pieces of AGE. 12.4.12.  This  also  reduces  wear  of  the  tow  vehicle  starter.    Operators  must  shut  off  the vehicle, set the parking brake, and place the vehicle in park or reverse if they do not drive off with the AGE equipment following hookup or delivery.  (T-1). 12.4.13.  If  operating  a  vehicle  on  the  flightline  while  wearing  night  vision  devices, additional  training,  safety  precautions  and  driving  techniques  are  needed.  For  more information on flightline safety while wearing night vision devices, refer to AFI 13-213 and Chapter 14. 12.5.  Control Tower Signals. 12.5.1.  Tower personnel control all vehicles operating on the flightline.  GMV operators will observe and obey their light signals and radio instructions.  (T-0). 12.5.2.  Control tower light signals will be posted in plain view of GMV operators on either the dash panel or other appropriate location.  (T-0). 12.5.3.  The  following  light  signals  flashed  from  the  control  tower  are  designed  to  control flightline vehicle traffic: 12.5.3.1.  Steady green light – Clear to cross. 12.5.3.2.  Steady red light – Stop.  Do not move vehicle. 12.5.3.3.  Flashing red light – Clear runway/taxiway. 12.5.3.4.  Flashing white light – Return to starting point. 12.5.3.5.  Red and green light – General warning.  Exercise extreme caution.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 159 12.6.  Follow Me Vehicles. 12.6.1.  “Follow me” vehicles used to guide aircraft will be equipped with signs easily visible at night reading STOP and FOLLOW ME.  (T-0). 12.6.2.  They should also be equipped with two-way radio equipment for communication on control tower frequencies. 12.6.3.  When  approaching  the  parking  spot,  the  “follow  me”  GMV  operator  should illuminate  the  stop  signal,  move  the  vehicle  from  the  intended  path  of  aircraft  travel,  and position it laterally, clear to the aircraft wing tip. 12.6.4.  The  marshal,  who  may  be  the  GMV  operator,  will  then  guide  the  aircraft  to  the parking spot using marshaling signals contained in applicable Air Force directives.  (T-1). 12.6.5.  To  accommodate  the  optimum  safe  taxiing  speed  of  aircraft,  guiding  “follow  me” vehicles can exceed the normal 15 mph flightline speed limit. 12.6.6.  Tugs will not be used as “follow me” vehicles at any time.  (T-0). 12.7.  Refueling and Servicing Equipment. 12.7.1.  Operators of vehicles and servicing equipment will approach the aircraft so that the GMV operator’s side is adjacent to the aircraft.  (T-0).  At no time, except in certain backing operations, will a GMV operator drive their vehicle or equipment directly toward the parked aircraft.  (T-0). 12.7.2.  A  sudden  brake  failure  could  result  in  a  collision.    Where  backing  is  absolutely necessary in the approach to aircraft, post a guide and place chocks to prevent vehicle from backing into the aircraft. 12.7.3.  Even with this precaution, do not back toward the aircraft at a speed too fast for the bumper chocks to efficiently stop the vehicle in case of brake failure. 12.7.4.  When approaching an aircraft to be fueled or de-fueled by a truck, the GMV operator will  approach  the  aircraft  parallel  to  the  wings  (except  in  instances  where  single  point locations of the aircraft require a different approach).  (T-1). 12.7.4.1.  Check with the supervisor for specific instructions. 12.7.4.2.  Always remember to leave the vehicle door ajar while servicing operations are performed so that the vehicle can be moved quickly in an emergency. 12.7.5.  Stop  the  fuel-servicing  equipment  at  least  20  feet  from  the  aircraft  (upwind  if possible) and move cautiously into servicing position upon signal from directing personnel. 12.7.5.1.  Keep  a  distance  of  20  feet  between  the  fueling  unit  and  aircraft  fuel  intake and/or vents. 12.7.5.2.  Keep  a  minimum  of  10  feet  at  all  times  between  the  fueling  unit  and  any portion of the aircraft. 12.7.5.3.  Check  to  see  that  suitable  fire  extinguishers  are  in  position  before  beginning fuel transfer operations.  160 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 12.7.6.  When  servicing  aircraft  with  vehicles  equipped  with  power  takeoff  in  lieu  of  a pumping  engine,  keep  a  10-foot  minimum  clearance  between  the  vehicle  and  the  leading edge of the wing. 12.7.6.1.  Do not back these vehicles toward the trailing edge of the wing. 12.7.6.2.  Exercise caution to make sure that the prime mover exhaust system is outside the minimum 20-foot separation distance from the aircraft filler points or vents. 12.8.  Aircraft  and  Equipment  Towing  GMV  Operator  Responsibilities  and Qualifications.  Towing  aircraft  is,  in  itself,  not  a  hazardous  operation  when  done  properly.  Experience  has  proven  that  inexperienced  personnel  and  failure  to  follow  established  towing procedures contained in applicable rules and regulations usually cause towing mishaps. 12.8.1.  As a towing operator, personnel must operate their vehicle in a safe manner.  (T-0).  Follow  the  instructions  the  team  supervisor  issues.    Also  obey  emergency-stop  instructions given by any team member. 12.8.2.  The  OJT  operator  will  receive  special  towing  equipment  training  in  their organization by qualified instructors who are thoroughly familiar with the type of equipment and operating procedures to be performed.  (T-1). 12.8.3.  The  OJT  operator  will  possess  a  current  AF  Form  2293  when  operating  special-purpose vehicles with more than 10,000 GVW.  (T-1).  A current AF Form 2296 will be on file in OR&L.  (T-1). 12.8.4.  An  authorized,  qualified  instructor  will  be  in  the  towing  vehicle  when  training  is conducted.    (T-1).    GMV  operators  will  receive  training  on  each  specific  type  of  towing vehicle  that  they  are  to  operate.    (T-1).    Qualifications  will  be  entered  on  their  AF  Form 2296.    (T-1).    Training  will  be  conducted  for  each  specific  piece  of  equipment  towed  by pintle  hook  on/off  base.    (T-1).    Qualifications  will  be  entered  in  the  appropriate  training records.  (T-1). 12.8.5.  GMV  operators  will  not  tow  aircraft  unless  accompanied  by  a  qualified  GMV operator in an authorized seated position.  (T-1).  The operator must be sure that the student has  been  sufficiently  instructed  and  trained  on  the  type  of  towing  vehicle  being  used  and aircraft to be moved.  (T-1). 12.8.6.  When approaching the aircraft to be moved, the tow GMV operator will stop at least 50  feet  from  the  aircraft.    (T-1).    They  will  proceed  only  on  specific  instruction  from  the NCOIC of the towing team.  (T-1).  The tow bar will be unhooked from the towing vehicle and moved (by hand) into the aircraft hookup position.  (T-1).  The GMV operator will not exceed a maximum speed of 5 mph.  (T-1).  Before the towing vehicle is unhooked from the aircraft, put chocks in place and set the aircraft brakes. 12.8.7.  Towing  equipment  will not  be dispatched to  or operated by  personnel  not  having a current  vehicle  operator’s  permit.    (T-0).    The  operator’s  permit  must  also  be  properly authenticated for the type of vehicle being requested.  (T-0).  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 161 Chapter 13 VEHICLE RECOVERY OVERVIEW Section 13A—Vehicle Recovery General Information 13.1.  General  Information.  This  chapter  describes  a  few  of  the  more  common  field  vehicle recovery procedures – operations that can be performed with limited resources.  In any of these operations,  remember  to  use  brainpower  to  make  up  for  a  lack  of  available  horsepower.    Time should  be  taken  to  figure  out  the  rigging  and  include  a  reasonable  factor  for  safety.    Sloppy planning  results  in  wasted  time  and  may  further  damage  the  vehicle  and  equipment  as  well  as causing injury or death to personnel.  Recovery failures are often the direct result of haste. Note:  For detailed vehicle-specific vehicle recovery procedures and safety practices, refer to the proper Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual and respective lesson plan. Section 13B—Recovery Safety 13.2.  Recovery  Safety.  Recovery  can  be  inherently  dangerous  unless  safety  is  continually observed  and  practiced.    Each  of  the  recovery  functions  (winching,  lifting,  and  towing)  should only  be  performed  with  safety  as  the  primary  concern.    Always  follow  safety  warnings  in  this manual and in the operator’s manual for both the recovery vehicle and the recovered vehicle or equipment.    Following  are  some  key  factors  and  actions  that  can  help  or  prevent  unnecessary damage to equipment and more importantly, injury to personnel: 13.2.1.  Know  recovery  equipment  capabilities  and  limitations.  Winches  have  tremendous power and if not properly secured to the disabled vehicle, can rip off tow lugs, bumpers, and other  attachments  that  often  become  projectiles  injuring  personnel  and/or  damaging equipment.    Always  follow  the  safe  rigging  guidelines  in  the  Manufacturer’s  Operator’s Manual  and  respective  vehicle  lesson  plan.    Keep  all  but  the  minimum  required  personnel away  from  the  recovery  area.    Each  recovery  crew  member  must  know  where  other  crew members are located at all times.  (T-0). 13.2.1.1.  Ground  chock  blocks  have  their  limitations.    If  overloaded,  the  recovery vehicle can slide out of control. 13.2.1.2.  Winch cables can break and backlash into equipment and personnel. 13.2.1.3.  Exercise extreme caution when towing. 13.2.1.4.  Some wheeled vehicles may not have any braking effect.  The recovery vehicle must provide braking for the towed vehicle as well as itself.  (T-0). Section 13C—Common Tools for Recovery 13.3.  Common Tools for Recovery: 13.3.1.  Tow Strap. 13.3.2.  Tow Cable. 13.3.3.  Tow Chains.  162 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 13.3.4.  Hydraulic Jack. 13.3.5.  Highway Warning Kit. Note:  Other recovery lifting actions also require extreme caution to prevent injury to personnel and/or damage to the recovery vehicle, recovered vehicle or equipment. Section 13D—Spotters for Recovery 13.4.  Spotters  for  Recovery.  For  safe  control  of  a  recovery  operation,  there  should  be  two spotters to prevent confusion.  Refer to Chapter 5 for more information on spotter requirements. Section 13E—Towing Vehicles With Bars 13.5.  Towing  Statement.  To  the  extent  possible,  a  wrecker  should  be  used  to  tow  wheeled vehicles.  Use of a wrecker or an approved tow bar may negate the need for an operator in the towed vehicle.  When a wrecker or tow bar is not used, an operator should be placed in the towed vehicle to assist with steering if required.  Due to increased risk of injury to the operator in the towed vehicle, it is extremely important to limit the use of anything but a wrecker or tow bar to those  cases  where  moving  the  vehicle  for  short  distances  is  an  absolute  military  necessity.    In such  cases,  speed  should  be  kept  to  a  minimum  to  ensure  safe  operation.    Unusual  or  unique towing  operations  may  have  an  associated  risk  assessment  with  residual  risk  approved  at  the proper level of command. 13.6.  General  Rules  for  Towing.  Before  towing  any  vehicle,  refer  to  the  Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual and respective lesson plan.  The following are general rules for towing: 13.6.1.  Move towed loads at slow speed.  Avoid quick stops. 13.6.2.  Mark towing vehicles with warning lights or flags. 13.6.3.  Use a wrecker whenever possible.  It is designed for towing. 13.6.4.  Use  a  tow  bar  in  preference  to  chains,  ropes  or  cables.    Tow  bars  keep  the  towed vehicle from running into the towing vehicle. 13.6.5.  Connect  cables,  chains,  or  ropes,  if  used,  to  the  pintle  of  the  towing  vehicle  and  to the lifting shackles of the towed vehicle. 13.6.6.  In cities or heavy traffic, tie the front lifting shackles of the towed vehicle tightly to the rear lifting shackles of the towing vehicle and connect the air brakes. 13.6.7.  Proceed slowly at 5 to 10 mph because the towed vehicle may skid on turns at higher speeds. 13.6.8.  When using a tow bar,  connect  a chain  between the two vehicles  for safety in  case the bar breaks or becomes disconnected. 13.6.9.  Be sure a GMV operator is in every motor vehicle being towed to control it, unless a wrecker is towing the vehicle. 13.6.10.  Always use rigger’s gloves when handling chains, cables, and wire rope.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 163 Section 13F—Anchoring Vehicles 13.7.  Anchoring  Vehicles.  Trees,  stumps,  or  rocks  are  natural  anchors.    Always  attach  lines near  the  ground  when  using  a  tree  or  a  stump  as an  anchor.    A  GMV  operator  should  lash  the first tree or stump to a second one to provide added support for the line.  When using a rock as an anchor, be sure it is large and firmly embedded in the ground.  Construct anchors when natural ones  are  not  available.    For  more  information  on  methods  for  anchoring  vehicles,  see  the applicable vehicle lesson plan. Section 13G—Winch Recovery 13.8.  Winch Recovery.  Many military trucks are equipped with winches.  Know how to get the most from  a winch without  danger to  personnel  or abuse to the equipment.   For additional and vehicle-specific  guidance  on  winch  recovery  to  include:    Single-vehicle  winch  recovery,  two-vehicle  winch  recovery,  cable  safety,  A-frame  recovery,  and  field  expedients,  refer  to  the Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual for that vehicle and the applicable vehicle lesson plan. 13.8.1.  As  a  general  guideline,  to  ensure  safety,  the  protection  of  the  equipment,  and  the success of the recovery operation, use the following as a guide: 13.8.1.1.  Check  the  capacity  of  the  winch.    The  capacity  shown  on  the  manufacturer’s plate  is  the  maximum  with  one  layer  of  cable  on  the  drum.    Each  successive  layer increases  the  diameter  of  the  drum  and  reduces  the  winch  capacity  to  as  little  as  50 percent of the rated capacity when the last layer is being wound on the drum. 13.8.1.2.  Check the cable for rust, kinks, or frays. 13.8.1.3.  Estimate  the  total  resistance.    Consider  grade  or  slope,  weight  of  the  vehicle, and type of terrain.  Then add a reasonable factor for safety. 13.8.1.4.  Check the equipment.  Be sure to rig safely to overcome the resistance with the equipment available. 13.8.1.5.  Select or provide a suitable anchor. 13.8.1.6.  Rig and check rigging.  Do not put power on the winch until every element in the rigging has been checked. 13.8.1.7.  Clear  personnel  from  the  danger  area.    All  persons  observing  the  operation should stand outside the angle formed by the cable under stress at a distance at least equal to the distance between the two most distant points in the rigging.

General Information.  The GMV operator must know specific procedures for maintaining convoy speed, halting, and handling breakdowns.  (T-0).  The GMV operator should also know convoy and aircraft loading signals as well as NATO convoy flags.  For additional information on motor marches and convoy operations (also referred to as line-haul), aircraft loading signals, and the use of NATO convoy flags and convoy signals, refer to:  Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and  Procedures  (AFTTP(I))  3-2.58.,  Multi-Service  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  for Tactical Convoy Operations, Army Techniques Publication (ATP) 4-11, Army Motor Transport Operations, and ATP 4-16, Movement Control. Section 14B—Motor Marches and Convoys Overview 14.2.  Rate-of-Speed  and  Interval.  The  road,  weather,  and  amount  of  space  needed  between vehicles to allow for stopping without rear-end collisions and for letting faster-moving vehicles pull  into  the  column  after  passing,  determine  the  proper  rate-of-speed  and  interval.    Of  all  the space  around  the  vehicle,  the  area  ahead  of  the  vehicle  (the  space  that  the  GMV  operator  is driving into) is most important. 14.2.1.  Determining space to keep between vehicles. 14.2.1.1.  One good rule to determine how much space to keep in front of the vehicle is to allow at least one second for each 10 feet of vehicle length at speeds below 40 mph.  At greater speeds, add one second for safety. 14.2.1.2.  For example, if driving a 40-foot vehicle, the GMV operator should leave four seconds  between  their  vehicle  and  the  vehicle  ahead,  in  a  60-foot  vehicle,  6  seconds.  Over 40 mph, a GMV operator needs 5 seconds for a 40-foot vehicle; 7 seconds for a 60-foot vehicle. 14.2.1.3.  To  know  how  much  space  a  GMV  operator  has,  he/she  should  wait  until  the vehicle  ahead  passes  a  shadow  on  the  road,  a  pavement  marking,  or  some  other  clear landmark.  Then count the seconds, one thousand one, one thousand two, and so on, until he/she reaches the same spot. 14.2.1.3.1.  The GMV operator can compare their count with the rule of 1 second for every 10 feet of length. 14.2.1.3.2.  For  example,  if  driving  a  40-foot  truck  and  only  count  2  seconds,  the GMV operator is too close.  The GMV operator should drop back a little and recount until the right number of seconds of following distance is reached.  When the road is slippery, more space is required to stop. 14.2.2.  Maintain the proper place in the convoy. 14.2.2.1.  If a GMV operator has no other orders, a good general rule is to keep a distance in yards that is twice the rate-of-speed at which driving.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 165 14.2.2.2.  For example, if traveling at 25 mph, leave 50 yards between the vehicle and the one just ahead at 30 mph, 60 yards.  Remember, this distance is in  yards, not feet.  The number that is used to multiply, in this case 2, is called the speedometer multiplier (SM).  The convoy commander may set an SM greater than two. 14.2.3.  Judging distances.   In  applying the SM, the GMV operator should be able to  judge distances.  They can do this more easily by practicing estimating distances. 14.2.3.1.  Take  a  known  distance  (such  as  the  length  of  a  truck  or  the  distance  between telephone poles) and observe carefully how that distance looks.  Try this in different light conditions (such as day, night, and dusk).  A GMV operator can soon be able to estimate distances accurately. 14.3.  Vehicle  Failures.  If  the  vehicle  fails  while  driving  in  a  convoy,  remember  these  basic rules: 14.3.1.  Signal a stop and pull off the road. 14.3.2.  Signal vehicles behind to proceed. 14.3.3.  Correct the trouble if possible and fall back in the column at one of the breaks (halts). 14.3.4.  If  the  GMV  operator  or  a  mechanic  left  with  the  GMV  operator  cannot  repair  the trouble, wait for the trail officer and tell them of the difficulties.  They make the necessary arrangements. Note:  Caution, the GMV operator should not attempt to exceed the designated catch-up speed (or posted speed limit) to regain position within the convoy.  Doing so may cause an accident. 14.4.  Vehicle  Halts.  A  convoy  halt  is  made  for  personal  convenience,  checking  the  vehicle’s operational status, checking load security, and refueling (if necessary).  Make the at-halt checks at  each  halt.    Be  sure  to  keep  off  the  road,  if  possible,  while  checking  the  vehicle.    If  a  GMV operator needs to halt on the road, their designated assistant GMV operator should act as a guard to  warn  other  traffic.    Each  GMV  operator  should  accomplish  specific  duties  while  at  the  halt.  These duties are determined by the convoy commander prior to start of convoy. 14.5.  Convoy  Security.  Convoys  are  inviting  targets  for  an  enemy  force.    Convoys  cannot always  depend  on  security  support  or  added  firepower.  Such  support  is  often  not  available because  of  other  priorities.    To  provide  more  firepower  for  a  convoy,  units  may  employ  a hardened  gun  truck.  The  purpose  of  a  gun  truck  is  to:    provide  a  mobile  firing  platform,  help counter enemy attacks, and to increase survivability of the convoy. 14.6.  Convoy  Control  Signals.  Use  and  obey  hand  signals  in  a  convoy.    In  addition  to  the signals  for  right  and  left  turns,  stopping,  and  so  forth,  the  GMV  operator  must  learn  convoy control  signals.    (T-1).    Whenever  a  march  column  is  halted  on  a  curve  or  downgrade,  or whenever some GMV operators cannot see the signal, signals may be relayed along the column or transmitted by messenger to all concerned. 14.7.  NATO  Convoy  Flags  and  Signals.  The  GMV  operator  is  responsible  for  knowing  the proper use and placement of NATO convoy flags and signals.  More information regarding the use  of  NATO  convoy  flags  and  signals  will  be  available  through  the  convoy  commander,  and through referencing AFTTP(I) 3-2.58., ATP 4-11, and ATP 4-16.  (T-0).  166 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Section 14C—Vehicle Camouflage Operations 14.8.  Camouflage Operations.  Understanding the fundamentals of camouflaging is vital to the mission.  Without proper camouflage a vehicle could be seen and attacked by an airstrike. 14.9.  Stationary  Vehicle  Camouflage  and  Concealment.  A  stationary  vehicle  can  best  be camouflaged  by  placing  it  under  vegetation  to  break  up  the  regular  pattern  of  shadows  and  by covering all parts that are likely to reflect light.  Use blankets, shelter halves, or pieces of dark burlap to cover the windshield, cab window, a wet vehicle body, light paint on insignia, and so forth.  Use foliage to cover headlights.  Fishnet or chicken wire scattered with artificial material or with vegetation can be used to cover the vehicle when trees or bushes are not available.  When snow is on the ground, cover the vehicle with white cloth.  Be sure that color and texture blend with the surrounding area. 14.10.  Camouflage  Screen  System.  The  camouflage  screen  system  is  the  principal  artificial expedient for camouflaging vehicles.  Use it when concealment by natural methods or materials is not possible.  Use it also to supplement natural methods and materials in sparsely vegetated or barren areas (such as deserts, predominantly snow-covered areas, and thinly wooded areas). 14.11.  Erecting of Camouflage Screens  Over  Vehicle.  When erecting the camouflage screen over a vehicle, take extreme care to prevent the screen from snagging and tearing on any sharp corners  or  vehicle  accessories  (such  as  mirrors,  bumpers,  mounted  armament,  and  so  forth).  When joining multiple screens, first spread the screens to be joined over a level ground site free from  large rocks and sharp objects.   Be sure the same pattern designs on all screens are facing the same way. Section 14D—Vehicle Operations Using Night Vision Devices and Operations Under Blackout (BO) Conditions 14.12.  General Information.  Night operations in combat, combat support, and combat service support  units  have  played  an  important  role  in  many  US  Air  Force  engagements.    In  fact,  the ability  to  conduct  effective  tactical  transportation  operations  during  hours  of  darkness  and limited  visibility  is  a  long-standing  Air  Force  objective.    Today’s  technology  provides  each GMV operator with the ability to meet these objectives using the driver’s vision enhancer (DVE) and  night  vision  goggles  (NVGs).    A  GMV  operator’s  ability  to  safely  and  effectively  drive using night  vision devices (NVDs) depends on their understanding the device’s limitations and capabilities,  the  amount  of  ambient  (available)  light,  driving  ability,  proficiency  with  NVDs, familiarity with the terrain, and availability of NVDs. 14.13.  Night  Vision  Goggles  Introduction.  Night  vision  goggles  are  image-intensification devices  that  improve  visibility  during  periods  of  low  light  levels.    They  amplify  available ambient light (such as moonlight and starlight).  However, NVGs do not magnify an image.  An object  viewed  through  the  NVGs  looks  the  same  size  as  if  it  were  seen  in  the  day  without  the NVGs.    Objects  that  are  hard  to  see  during  the  day  are  also  hard  to  see  at  night  through  the NVGs.  NVG performance is directly related to the amount of ambient light.  During periods of high ambient light, resolution is improved and objects can be identified at greater distances. 14.13.1.  Visual acuity (the accuracy with which an object is seen) with NVGs may never be as good as it is with the naked eye during daylight conditions.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 167 14.13.1.1.  Rain, haze, fog, snow, or smoke and viewing into shadows and other darkened areas greatly reduce the effectiveness of NVGs. 14.13.1.2.  Vision using NVGs equals the vision of an unaided GMV operator with less than  perfect  vision.    The  best  case  for  a  GMV  operator  with  20/20  vision  wearing  the NVGs is 20/40 with the AN/PVS-7 and 20/50 with the AN/PVS-5. 14.13.2.  The NVGs affect depth perception and distance estimation. 14.13.2.1.  For the first 20 feet in front of the user, the NVG decreases depth perception.  From 20 to 500 feet, depth discrimination roughly equals that of the unaided eye. 14.13.2.2.  NVGs reduce depth perception beyond 500 feet and distance viewing.  This is due mainly to reduced visual acuity and lack of peripheral vision. 14.13.3.  Peripheral  vision  lets  a  person  see  things  on  the  side  of  the  field  of  vision  while concentrating on looking straight ahead at an object. 14.13.4.  Color discrimination is absent when NVGs are used. 14.14.  Single Color Vision.  The picture seen with NVGs is green.  It is also less distinct than normal daylight vision.  As a result, it is hard to distinguish between certain objects or features.  For example, shadows are hard to distinguish from puddles of water, walls, or ditches and vice versa when viewed through the NVGs at night. 14.15.  Color Adaptation.  A person, because of the green color in NVGs, may see one of two things when removing the NVGs after several minutes: 14.15.1.  If  looking  at  the  lighter  of  two  backgrounds,  one  may  see  the  complement  or opposite of the green color to which they had become adapted. 14.15.2.  If looking at the darker of the two backgrounds, one might see an after-image of the green light to which they had become adapted.  Do not be concerned with this after-image, it is a normal physical reaction. 14.16.  Considerations  When  Driving  With  Night  Vision  Goggles.  Driving  during  the  day takes a lot of concentration. Driving at night with Night Vision Goggles compounds the amount of  concentration  needed  to  safely  operate  a  vehicle.    Also,  see  Table  14.1.  for  NVG  lighting countermeasures. 14.16.1.  Effects  of  Light.    Any  detectable  light  source  in  the  vehicle’s  cab  may  affect  the GMV operator’s ability to see with NVGs.  The adverse effect of panel lights on the NVGs is greatest during low ambient light conditions. 14.16.1.1.  Vehicle Light System.  NVG compatibility is best achieved by eliminating all interior and exterior light sources.  Tape up lights that cannot be controlled to reduce the amount  of  light  they  emit.    Instruments  and  gauges  can  normally  be  read  with  NVGs without instrument lighting. 14.16.1.2.  Dark  Adaptation.    No  dark  adaptation  period  is  necessary  for  effective viewing through NVGs.  In fact, viewing through NVGs for a short period of time lessens the  normal  dark  adaptation  period.    After  using  NVGs,  it  takes  about  two  minutes  to reach the 30-minute dark adaptation level.  168 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 14.16.1.3.  Lasers.  Lasers are used on the battlefield (in training and in combat).  Lasers affect  NVGs  as  much  as  other  light  sources  do.    Most  lasers  may  not  cause  permanent damage  to  NVGs.    In  fact,  the  NVGs  protect  the  GMV  operator’s  eyes  from  the damaging effects of lasers, even if the laser is bright enough to damage the NVGs.  If the NVGs are damaged, it is possible to continue using the NVGs with a bright or dark spot at the point where the tube was damaged.  To reduce the effects of the laser on the NVGs and eyesight, look away. 14.16.2.  Object  Identification.    Viewing  an  area  lit  by  artificial  lights  (such  as  flares)  can limit the ability to see objects outside the lighted area.  The ability to see objects within the lighted area depends on the brightness of the light and the object’s distance. 14.16.2.1.  Try to keep the light source outside the field of view of the NVGs. 14.16.2.2.  Using NVGs enable personnel to detect light sources that are not visible to the unaided  eye.    Light  from  vehicles,  flashlights,  IR  light  sticks,  and  burning  cigarettes  is easily detected  at  great  distances.  The  capability  of  NVGs to  detect  these  light  sources improves as the ambient light level decreases. 14.16.2.3.  When  using  NVGs,  some  objects  may  be  more  difficult  to  distinguish  (low contrast against the background) than during the day when color clues are available.  Pay close attention to unfamiliar objects. Note:  Warning, GMV operators without NVGs may not see another operator.  Ensure the route selected is in an area where other traffic (commercial and tactical) is precluded.  If the route does not preclude this, establish some form of traffic control. Table 14.1.

Turn off BO drive or ensure BO hood is adjusted so light only shines down.  Use BO lights. 14.16.3.  Vehicle Preparation.  The design of some Air Force vehicles can affect the ability to see  outside  the  windshield.    To  reduce  the  loss  of  night  vision  because  of  vehicle shortcomings, properly prepare the vehicle for night driving with NVGs. 14.16.3.1.  Vehicle instruments are easier to read under high levels of instrument lighting.  However, the level of light needed for the best reading interferes with the NVGs ability to see dim objects outside the vehicle.  Interior lights also interfere with NVG performance.  They  reflect  off  the  windshield,  reduce  outside  visibility,  and  are  subject  to  enemy detection.    To  minimize  these  effects,  turn  off  all  interior  lights  and  turn  off  or  tape  all exterior lights. 14.17.  Driving  Techniques  With  Night  Vision  Goggles.  The  ability  to  drive  with  NVGs  is developed through training.  The more a GMV operator drives with NVGs, the more they learn about them.  As a result, they gain confidence in their ability and in the capability of the device.  On the other hand, overconfidence is a main fault associated with NVG use.  After wearing the device for only a short time, one may feel they have complete visual acuity and depth perception when in fact they do not. 14.17.1.  Driving  techniques  and  visual  clues  used  during  unaided  night  driving  (without NVGs) also apply to aid night driving (with NVGs).  The advantage of NVG use is improved ground reference and object identification.  However, the field of view is greatly reduced. 14.17.1.1.  Use a continual scanning pattern to make up for this.  To view an area while using NVGs, turn head slowly until the NVGs point in the desired direction.  Rapid head movement can induce vertigo, which may lead to dizziness and nausea. Note:  Warning, never use NVGs on public highways.  The effect of oncoming headlights on the device may cause some very dangerous situations (such as the GMV operator not being able to see other objects in the field of view).  170 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 14.17.1.2.  If the light is sufficiently bright, the devices all have a bright source protection feature that shuts down the NVG to protect it. 14.17.1.3.  If  the  bright  source  protection  is  activated,  the  NVGs  will  be  off  for  at  least two hours.  (T-1). 14.17.2.  To minimize the effect of headlights from an oncoming vehicle: 14.17.2.1.  Slow down. 14.17.2.2.  Look away so that the light source is just outside the NVGs field of view. 14.17.2.3.  Pull off to the far right-hand side of the road, and stop the vehicle. 14.17.2.4.  DO  NOT  continue  driving  with  NVGs  unless  authorized  by  a  responsible officer or individual (such as the range control officer). 14.18.  Role of the Assistant GMV Operator.  The assistant GMV operator plays an important role in driving with NVGs. 14.18.1.  The  GMV  operator  should  focus  the  NVGs  for  distance  vision  even  though  this makes  instrument  reading  difficult.    An  assistant  GMV  operator  wearing  NVGs  can compensate  for  this  by  alternating  between  distance  and  close-up  viewing  and  telling  the GMV  operator  the  status  of  warning  lights,  speedometer,  fuel  gauge,  and  other  instrument readings. 14.18.2.  Depending on the vehicle configuration, the assistant GMV operator may need to sit directly behind the GMV operator to gain a better view of the instrument panel. 14.18.3.  The  assistant  GMV  operator  must  also  use  a  slow  scanning  pattern  and  tell  the GMV operator of any obstacles inside or outside his/her field-of-view.  (T-1). 14.19.  Parking Vehicles.  When parking vehicles in areas where NVG tactical lighting is used, trained spotters equipped with NVGs should direct GMV operators to parking spots. 14.19.1.  Neither GMV operators nor guides should remove their NVGs until the vehicle is in the desired parking spot. 14.19.2.  Modify  flashlights  used  by  spotters  for  NVG  compatibility.    Alternative  light sources for use during tactical operations are available in the Air Force supply system. 14.20.  Operations Under Blackout Conditions Without Night Vision Devices. 14.20.1.  When operating under BO conditions, be sure the BO marker lights are functioning properly. 14.20.2.  Lower the windshield to improve visibility. 14.20.3.  Drive at reduced speeds. 14.20.4.  If in a column, watch the rear BO marker lights of the vehicle ahead to be sure of following at the correct distance.  Remember, the white BO stoplight of the vehicle ahead is on the right and left side. 14.21.  Blackout  Marker  Lights.  To  show  the  location  of  vehicles  during  BO  conditions, military vehicles are equipped with four BO marker lights.  Two of these lights are on the rear corners  of  the  vehicles  and  the  other  two  are  on  the  front  (see  Figure  14.2.).    They  do  not  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 171 illuminate the road but depending on the weather can indicate the position of a vehicle as much as 250 yards ahead.  These lights cannot be seen from an airplane flying higher than 400 feet. 14.21.1.  When  operating  a  vehicle  in  a  convoy  under  BO  conditions,  if  practicable,  post  a person equipped with a screened flashlight or large white piece of material in the rear of the vehicle to warn the following operator if they approach too closely. 14.21.2.  An alert rear guard can usually detect  a vehicle at a reasonable distance, even one with no lamps.  In BO operation, vehicles should maintain a speed of 5 to 10 mph (8 to 16 kph (kilometers per hour)). 14.21.3.  When a vehicle is disabled on the side of the road, the GMV operator is based at the rear of the disabled vehicle with a screened flashlight or large white piece of material to warn approaching vehicles of the danger.

Assembling  Equipment.    The  navigator  must  gather  all  required  equipment  (maps, pencils, and so forth) before the mission starts.  (T-1). 15.1.2.  Servicing  Equipment.    The  navigator  is  responsible  to  ensure  the  operational serviceability of equipment before the mission starts.  (T-1). 15.1.3.  Recording Data for Precise Locations.  During movement, the navigator must make sure  that  the  correct  direction  and  distance  are  recorded  and  followed.    (T-1).    Grid coordinates of locations must be recorded and plotted.  (T-1). Section 15B—Land Navigation Overview 15.2.  Maps.  An easy way to become familiar with the area of operation is by studying a map.  From the map operators can determine the major roads and where they go.  Also, maps indicate obvious landmarks such as mountains, valleys, coastlines, rivers, cities, railroads, crossroads, and bridges.  The two basic types of maps are the grid map and the strip map. 15.2.1.  For more information on land navigation, see AFTTP 3-4, Airman’s Manual. 15.3.  Military Grid Reference System.  To keep from getting lost, operators have to know how to find out where they are.  There are no street addresses in a combat area, but a military map can identify locations accurately. 15.4.  Grid Squares.  The map has lines running up and down (north and south) and across (east and west).  These lines form small squares 1,000 meters on each side called grid squares. 15.5.  Determining  Coordinates.  The  lines  that  form  grid  squares  are  numbered  along  the outside edge of the map picture.  No two grid squares may have the same number.  The precision of a point location is shown by the number of digits in the coordinates the more digits, the more precise the location; for example: 15.5.1.  1181 is a 1,000 meter grid square. 15.5.2.  115813 is to the nearest 100 meters. 15.5.3.  11508133 is to the nearest 10 meters. 15.5.4.  For instance, suppose an address is grid square 1181.  How is this found?  Start from the left and read right until reaching 11, the first half of the address.  Then read up to 81, the other half. The address is somewhere in grid square 1181 (see Figure 15.1.).  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 173 Figure 15.1.  Grid Square.  15.5.5.  Grid  square  1181  provides  general  location,  but  there  is  a  lot  of  ground  inside  that grid square.   To provide a more  accurate location, just add another number to  the first  half and another number to the other half, so the location address has six numbers instead of four. 15.5.6.  To  get  those  extra  numbers  pretend  that  each  grid  square  has  10  lines  inside  it running  north  and  south  and  another  10  running  east  and  west.    This  makes  100  smaller squares.  Operators can estimate where these imaginary lines are. 15.5.7.  If the location is halfway between line 11 and line 12, the next number is 5 and the first half of the address is 115.  If the location is also three-tenths of the way between line 81 and line 82, then the second half of the location  address  is  813.  (If  exactly on line 81, the second half would be 810.).  Figure 15.2. shows that if the location is where the dot is in the grid square 1181, then the location address would be 115813. 15.5.8.  The most accurate way to determine the coordinates of a point on a map is to use a coordinate  scale  (see  Figure  15.3.).    Imaginary  lines  are  not  necessary  because  the  exact coordinates  are  displayed  on  the  coordinate  scale  and  protractor  or  the  plotting  scale.  Located on both of these devices are two coordinate scales:  1:25,000 and 1:50,000 meters.  When using either of these devices, be sure to use the correct scale. 15.5.9.  Use the coordinate scales to  determine the coordinates of  a point  (Point  A) already plotted  on  a  map  (see  Figure  15.4.).    First,  locate  the  grid  square  in  which  the  point  is located.  The number of the vertical grid line on the left (West) side of the grid square is the first and second digits of the coordinates (11).  The number of the horizontal grid line on the bottom (South) side of the grid square is the fourth and fifth digits of the coordinates (81).  174 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Figure 15.2.  Point on a Grid Square. Figure 15.3.  Coordinate Scales.    AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 175 Figure 15.4.  Determining Coordinates of a Point Using a Coordinate Scale.  15.5.10.  To determine the third and sixth digits of the coordinates, place the coordinate scale on the bottom grid square containing point A.  Be sure the zeroes of the coordinate scale are in the lower left-hand (Southwest) corner of the grid square.  Slide the coordinate scale to the right,  keeping  the  bottom  of  the  scale  on  the  bottom  grid  line  until  point  A  is  under  the vertical (right-hand) scale. 15.5.11.  To determine a six-digit coordinate, the 100-meter mark on the bottom scale, which is  nearest  the  north-south  grid  line,  is  the  third  digit,  5.    The  100-meter  mark  on  the  right-hand scale, which is nearest point A, is the sixth digit, 3.  Putting these together, establishes a location of 115813. 15.5.12.  To  determine  an  eight-digit  coordinate,  which  locates  a  point  on  the  ground  to within  10  meters,  keep  in  mind  that  there  are  100  meters  between  each  100-meter  mark (number) on the scale.  A short tick mark indicates 50 meters between each 100-meter mark.  As shown in Figure 15.2. the grid line crosses the bottom scale on the 500-meter mark, this makes the third and fourth digits 50.  If the grid line crossed the scale between the 500- and 600-meter mark, then interpolate how many meters it is  beyond 500 meters.  To determine the seventh  and eighth  digits, read the right-hand scale where the point is on the scale.  As shown, the point is between the 300- mark and the 50-meter tick mark.  Make an estimate of how many 10s the point is beyond the 300 mark. In this case it is 3, which makes the seventh and eighth digits, 33.  Putting these together, establishes a location of 11508133. 15.5.13.  To determine the correct two-letter 100,000-meter square identifier, look at the grid reference box in the margin of the map. Place the 100,000 – meter square identifier in front  176 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 of  the  coordinate  GL  11508133  (see  Figure  15.5.,  Figure  15.6.,  Figure  15.7.,  and  Figure 15.8.).

Estimating  the  Distance.  Maps  are  drawn  to  scale  so  measurements  of  distance  on  the map  estimate  the  distance  on  the  ground.    This  scale  may  be  indicated  by  a  note  such  as  ”3 inches  equals  1  mile.”    This  means  that  3  inches  on  the  map  equals  1  mile  on  the  ground.  By  178 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 using  a  3-inch  strip  of  paper  as  a  ruler  to  measure  the  number  of  miles  on  the  map,  the  actual miles can be estimated. Sometimes instead of a note, a ruler is printed on the map.  Another way to show the scale is by a representative fraction; for instance, l/63,360 or 1:63,360.  This means that one unit of distance on the map equals 63,360 units on the ground.  For instance, 1 inch on the map equals 63,360 inches on the ground which equals 5,280 feet or 1 mile. 15.7.  Unit  Measurements.  United  States  units  for  measuring  distance  are  in  terms  of  miles, yards,  and  feet.  In  most  overseas  areas,  the  metric  system  is  used.    A  GMV  operator  needs  to know metric measurements and how they compare to U.S. measurements because speedometers and  odometers  may  measure  in  miles  versus  kilometers.    A  kilometer  equals  a  little  over  six-tenths of a mile.  The following conversion method shows how to convert (approximately) to the metric system: 15.7.1.  Kilometers (km) to miles (mi):  multiply km by 0.62. 15.7.2.  Example:  37 km x 0.62 = 22.94 or 23 mi. 15.7.3.  Miles to kilometers:  multiply mi by 1.6. 15.7.4.  Example:  23 mi x 1.6 = 36.8 or 37 km. 15.8.  Estimating  the  Time.  Having  estimated  the  distance,  the  next  step  is  to  figure-the  time needed for travel.  In estimating time, remember that the maximum allowable speed should not exceed that shown on the caution plate in the cab or that specified by the commander.  Average speed  should  be  less  than  the  maximum  speed,  as  average  speed  includes  halts  and  traffic slowdowns. 15.9.  Recognizing Military Signs.  In addition to the signs and devices normally encountered in civilian and military driving, an operator must know signs peculiar to the military service.  (T-0).  These include signs or symbols and installation markers (see  Figure 15.9.).  Military signs and symbols  can  be  found  in  Army  Doctrine  Reference  Publication  (ADRP)  1-02,  Terms  and Military Symbols. Figure 15.9.  Strip Map Symbols.   AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 179 15.10.  Using  a  Strip  Map.  The  strip  map  shown  in  Figure  15.8.  is  a  sketch  of  a  route-of-march.  It may or may not be drawn to scale, but it should show the identifying landmarks.  A strip map may include varying degrees of information, such as: 15.10.1.  Start point and Release point. 15.10.1.1.  The start point (SP) is where all elements of a column come under the control of the convoy commander.  The SP should be a place along the route easily recognized on both maps and ground. 15.10.1.2.  The release point (RP) is a well-defined point on a route at which the elements composing a column return under the authority of their respective commanders, each one of these elements continuing its movement towards its own appropriate destination. 15.10.2.  Routes and route numbers. 15.10.3.  Major towns. 15.10.4.  Major roads and crossroads. 15.10.5.  Mileage between points. 15.10.6.  Safe havens, rest, halt, and petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL) areas. 15.10.7.  Directional arrows. 15.10.8.  Legend. Section 15C—Prepare Before Movement 15.11.  Movement Preparation.  Locate the start point and finish point on the map.  Determine the  map’s  grid  azimuth  from  start  point  to  finish  point  and  convert  it  to  a  magnetic  azimuth.  Determine the distance between the start point and finish point or any intermediate points on the map  and  make  a  thorough  map  reconnaissance  of  that  area.    Ensure  vehicle  is  prepared  for inclement weather operations prior to movement. Section 15D—Terrain Association Navigation 15.12.  Terrain Association.  This is currently the most widely used method of navigation.  The navigator plans the route to  move from  terrain  feature to  terrain  feature.   The navigator selects routes  or  streets  between  key  points  or  intersections.    These  routes  should  be  capable  of sustaining the travel of the vehicle or vehicles, should be relatively direct, and should be easy to follow. In a typical move, the navigator does the following: 15.12.1.  Determines current location. 15.12.2.  Determines the location of the objective. 15.12.3.  Notes both of the above locations on the navigation map. 15.12.4.  Selects a route between the two. 15.12.5.  After examining the terrain, makes the necessary rout adjustments by the following actions:  180 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 15.12.5.1.  Consider Tactical Aspects.  Avoid skylining, select key terrain for overwatch positions, and select concealed routes. 15.12.5.2.  Consider  Ease  of  Movement.    Use  the  easiest  possible  route  and  bypass difficult  terrain.    Remember  that  a  difficult  route  is  harder  to  follow,  is  noisier,  causes more  wear  and  tear  (and  possible  recovery  problems),  and  takes  more  time.    Tactical surprise is achieved by doing the unexpected.  Try to select an axis or corridor instead of a specific route.  Make sure there is enough maneuver room for the vehicles (see Figure 15.1.). 15.12.5.3.  Use  Terrain  Features  as  Checkpoints.    These  checkpoints  need  to  be  easily recognizable in the light and weather conditions and at the speed at which the navigator may  move.    The  navigator  should  be  able  to  find  a  terrain  feature  for  all  checkpoints along  each  segment/leg  of  the  route  and  should  be  used  as  a  visual  reference.    An example is checkpoint 2, the church, and checkpoint 3, the orchard (see Figure 15.10.). 15.12.5.3.1.  The  best  checkpoints  are  linear  features  that  cross  the  route.    Use streams, rivers, hard-top roads, ridges, valleys, and railroads. 15.12.5.3.2.  The  next  best  checkpoints  are  elevation  changes  (such  as  hills, depressions,  spurs,  and  draws).    Look  for  two  contour  lines  of  change.    While mounted, an operator should not be able to spot two lines of change. 15.12.5.3.3.  In wooded terrain, try to locate checkpoints at no more than 1,000-meter intervals.  In open terrain, checkpoints may go to about 5,000 meters. 15.12.5.4.  Follow  Terrain  Features.    Movement  and  navigation  along  a  valley  floor  or near (not necessarily on) the crest of a ridgeline is easiest. 15.12.5.5.  Determine  Directions.    Break  the  route  down  into  smaller  segments  and determine  the  rough  directions  that  can  be  followed.    An  operator  does  not  need  to  use the  compass;  just  the  main  points  of  direction  (north,  northeast,  east,  and  so  forth).  Before  moving,  note  the  location  of  the  sun  and  locate  north.    Locate  changes  of direction, if any, at the checkpoints picked. 15.12.5.6.  Determine Distance.  Get the total distance to be traveled and the approximate distance between checkpoints.  Plan to use the vehicle odometer to keep track of distance traveled.  Use the pace-count method and keep a record of the distance traveled.  When using  a  pace  count,  convert  from  map  distance  to  ground  distance  by  adding  the conversion factors of 20 percent for cross-country movement. 15.12.5.7.  Make  Notes.    Mental  notes  are  usually  adequate.    Try  to  imagine  what  the route is like and remember it. 15.12.5.8.  Plan  to  Avoid  Errors.    Restudy  the  route  selected.    Try  to  determine  where errors are most apt to occur and how to avoid any trouble. 15.12.5.9.  Use  a  Navigational  Log.    Prepare  a  navigational  log  when  the  routes  have been selected and when the distance to be traveled has been divided into legs.  The log is an informal record of the distance and azimuth of each leg, with notes to aid the navigator in following the correct route.  The notes list easily identifiable terrain features at or near the point where the direction of movement changes.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 181 Figure 15.10.  Primary Route. Section 15E—Blue Force Tracking (BFT)  15.13.  Blue  Force  Tracker.  BFT  is  a  United  States  military  automated  system  that  helps provide  commanders  with  information  about  friendly  and  enemy  forces.    FBCB2/BFT  consists of the AN/UYK-128(V) ruggedized computer and peripheral equipment.   Peripheral  equipment consists of a Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver (PLGR) or Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR). 15.14.  Precision  Lightweight  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS)  Receiver  (PLGR).  The PLGR  is  a  legacy  military  GPS  receiver  still  in  wide  use  today.    PLGR  is  a  key  element, providing real-time, precise position data for all  combat elements  to  the  battlefield information systems. 15.15.  Defense Advanced Global Positioning System (GPS) Receiver (DAGR).  The DAGR is  a  self-contained,  hand-held,  continuously  tracking  GPS  receiver.    It  uses  GPS  receiver technology.  Although designed as a hand-held receiver for ground-mobile and airborne troops, standardized  interfaces  enable  DAGR  to  provide  Position,  Navigation,  Timing  (PNT)  182 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 information  to  a  wide  variety  of  vehicles  and  host  systems  including  integrated  configurations for position location, target location, rendezvous and en-route and terminal navigation.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 183 Chapter 16 CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR (CBRN) OPERATIONS Section 16A—Operations in CBRN Environment 16.1.  General  Information.  Actual  operations  prove  that  response  actions  conducted  during training are also done during warfare.  A GMV operator must know what to do when driving in a CBRN environment.  (T-1).  For additional guidance, see AFTTP 3-2.60, Chemical, Biological, Radiological  and  Nuclear  Decontamination,  AFTTP  3-4,  AFMAN  10-2503,  Operations  in  a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Environment, and the Installation Emergency Management Plan (IEMP) 10-2. Section 16B—Practices for Operating Vehicle in Contaminated Area 16.2.  Operating a Vehicle in a Contaminated Area.  Personnel operating vehicles in a CBRN contaminated environment can reduce the risk of contamination through the use of contamination avoidance  measures  referred  in  the  Airman’s  Manual  and  AFTTP  3-2.60.    Operating  times  for personnel in a CBRN contaminated area may vary depending on the use of protective clothing, temperature, nature of the contaminant, type of soil and terrain,  and task to be performed.  For mission critical  operations in  a radiological  environment,  the commander has the responsibility and  authority  to  establish  the  minimum  exposure  dose  to  protect  the  Airmen.    The  following practices are helpful in carrying out the mission: 16.2.1.  Before  entering  CBRN  contaminated  areas,  don  protective  clothing  and  the protective mask, as required. 16.2.2.  Use hard-surface roads, if available. 16.2.3.  Avoid puddles and unnecessary splashing if roads are muddy. 16.2.4.  Clean the wheels of the vehicle after crossing the area. 16.2.5.  Move through the area as rapidly and safely as possible. 16.3.  Vehicle Operation While Wearing Protective Masks. 16.3.1.  Under  combat  conditions,  situations  change.    GMV  operators  may  be  moving forward, in a fighting position, or standing by in a replacement area some distance from the combat area.  In any of these situations, they are subject to enemy attacks. 16.3.2.  CBRN Defense  Survival  Skills  Training:   Additional  training is  required to  operate vehicles  in  chemical  warfare  defense  ensemble.    Training  is  documented  in  personnel training  records  (if  applicable).    MAJCOM  may  specify  training  requirements  and  vehicle types.  Mission oriented protective posture (MOPP) gear vehicle operation will be completed as  part  of  Air  Force  Expeditionary  Force  (AEF)  training,  such  as  law  of  armed  conflict (LOAC), self-aid buddy care (SABC), etc.  (T-1). 16.4.  Marker Descriptions.  184 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 16.4.1.  Use  the  triangular  signs  described  in  this  chapter  and  AFMAN  10-2503,  unless  the area  is  to  be  abandoned  to  threat  forces,  to  mark  CBRN  contaminated  areas,  chemical minefields, booby traps, and unexploded ordnance (UXOs).  See Figure 16.1. Figure 16.1.  Standard CBRN and UXO Hazard Markers.  16.5.  Vehicle and Equipment Decontamination.  In addition to the IEMP 10-2 checklists, the following guidelines should be followed to decontaminate vehicles and equipment: 16.5.1.  Contaminated vehicles and equipment are still serviceable.  Do not abandon or stop protecting  items  contaminated  from  previous  attacks.    Personnel  who  use  the  proper Individual  Protective  Equipment  (IPE)  and  protective  measures  can  use  contaminated vehicles  and  equipment.    As  soon  after  contamination  occurs,  and  as  the  situation  permits, decontaminate unit equipment. 16.5.2.  Operational  Decontamination.    The  most  effective  time  to  perform  operational decontamination is within one hour of contamination.  Decontamination can be performed by the  operator  or  by  the  whole  crew.    Operators  use  the  M295  Individual  Equipment Decontamination Kit (IEDK) to decontaminate the surfaces they need to touch or contact to operate  the  equipment.    Radiological  contamination  in  the  form  of  dust  particles  may  be wiped, scraped or brushed-off.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 185 16.5.3.  Vehicle Paint Schemes.  See AFTTP 3-2.60. 16.5.3.1.  Chemical  Agent  Resistant  Coating  (CARC)  is  a  supplemental  coating  applied to vehicles and equipment to enhance the ability of operators to decontaminate the item after a chemical attack. 16.5.3.1.1.  Most non-CARC painted surfaces readily absorb liquid  chemical  agents.  However,  chemical  agent  absorption  may  take  up  to  6  hours  on  CARC  painted vehicles  or  equipment  items,  as  long  as  the  assets  were  previously  painted  within  2 years prior to a chemical attack. 16.5.3.1.2.  Due  to  the  slower  rate  of  absorption  with  CARC  paint,  the  contact  and transfer hazard remains viable as long as the agent is on the surface.  Additionally, the resulting vapor concentrations are at their maximum limit. 16.5.3.1.3.  If  it  is  necessary  to  use  CARC  painted  vehicles  or  equipment  within  6 hours  of  contamination,  decontaminate  the  entire  exterior  in  addition  to  those  areas that may be continuously touched. 16.5.3.2.  Polyurethane  Paint:    The  majority  of  vehicles  and  equipment  on  Air  Force installations are painted with polyurethane compounds.  Chemical agents readily absorb into  this  type  of  paint.    Thus,  decontamination  operations  may  not  have  a  significant effect  unless  decontamination  activities  take  place  very  shortly  after  the  time  of contamination (within minutes).  When the liquid agent absorbs into the paint, it reduces the residual contact hazard and may present a vapor off-gassing hazard for long periods. 16.5.3.3.  Contaminated vehicle or interior. 16.5.3.3.1.  Seating  area  or  operator.    GMV  operators  and  passengers  should  place plastic sheeting or other barrier materials on seats if the seat area or the individual are (or  were  previously)  contaminated.    Body  heat  and  pressure  (from  sitting)  increases the potential for liquid chemical agents to penetrate the ensemble. 16.5.3.3.2.  Steering  wheel.    Consider  using  barrier  material  to  cover  the  steering wheels.    This  is  especially  important  for  vehicles  that  have  open  cabs  or  driver’s compartments. 16.6.  Pre/Post-  Attack  Preparation.  Pre-attack  actions  include  planning  a  vehicle  covering strategy,  protecting  the  vehicle  fleet,  and  pre-positioning  M8  paper  on  all  vehicle  assets.  Post-attack  actions  include  prioritizing  vehicle  use  after  an  attack,  conducting  expedient  vehicle decontamination,  and  performing  vehicle  maintenance  procedures in  a  contaminated environment.    Additional  post-attack  activities  include  providing  long-term  identification  of contaminated vehicles and supporting open-air contamination control area (CCA) operations. 16.6.1.  Contaminated Vehicle Identification and Marking. 16.6.1.1.  Each  vehicle  and  equipment  operator  is  responsible  for  covering  and  placing M8 paper on their assets prior to  attacks.  They  are also  responsible for identifying and marking contamination found after attacks. 16.6.1.2.  Upon  notification  from  the  Unit  Control  Center  (UCC)  or  Emergency Operations  Center  (EOC),  check  pre-positioned  M8  paper  on  assets  and  each  layer  of barrier materials and mark contamination.  When the item is contaminated, mark with the  186 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 appropriate symbol.  This is done to enable maintenance personnel to take the necessary protective actions and precautions when performing maintenance. 16.6.1.3.  The operator must notify their UCC of the contamination item’s status.  (T-1). 16.6.1.3.1.  The UCC consolidates unit information and passes this information to the EOC.  For vehicles, the UCCs will also notify the VOCC and vehicle fleet manager (VFM)  and  include  the  POC  information,  vehicle  location,  contamination  type, damaged or unserviceable status, and vehicle registration number.  (T-1). 16.6.1.4.  For vehicles, place the marker in lower center portion of the windshield.  Each GMV  operator  will  annotate  the  AF  Form  1800  when  the  marker  is  placed.    (T-1).  Include  the  date  and  time  of  the  contamination,  the  agent  type  and  the  location  of  the contamination on the vehicle. 16.6.1.4.1.  If the inspection form is not available or becomes contaminated, provide the  same  information,  along  with  the  vehicle  or  equipment  registration  or identification number, to the unit UCC. 16.6.2.  Dispersal and Expedient Hardening.  Vehicle dispersal is a valuable asset protection technique.    The  probability  is  high  that  effective  dispersal  may  protect  some  vehicle  assets from contamination or damage from conventional weapons effects.  However, use dispersal actions  with  expedient  hardening  and  overhead  cover  whenever  possible.    Additionally, personnel  should  guard  against  the  tendency  to  park  a  large  number  of  vehicles  at  any  one location due to the ease of access. 16.6.2.1.  When  identifying  or  constructing  dispersal  sites,  choose  a  combination  of features  that  provide  the  best  available  expedient  or  natural  protection  and  support mission needs. 16.6.2.2.  Locate multiple dispersal sites in areas that are not within the effective range of adversary  ground  force  weapons.    If  possible,  locate  sites  on  a  concrete  or  asphalt surfaces and ensure there are at least two entry and exit routes.  One of the routes should be a concrete or asphalt surface.  Enhance protection by locating dispersal sites in areas that  is  under  the  direct  observation  or  control  of  a  security  forces  defensive  fighting position  or  an  owner-user  security  checkpoint.    To  simplify  retrieval  and  post-attack reconnaissance tasks, place sites near a unit work area. 16.6.2.3.  Consider  using  dispersed  vehicles  as  storage  locations  for  alternate  mission supporting materials, such as tools and equipment. 16.6.3.  Contaminated  vehicles.    Use  contaminated  vehicles  only  when  uncontaminated vehicles of the same type are unavailable.  If possible, coordinate with the requesting unit to delay non-critical operations until the uncontaminated vehicle is available. 16.6.3.1.  As  a  safety  precaution,  always  wear  appropriate  IPE  when  working  with  or around previously contaminated vehicles. 16.6.3.2.  Dispose  of  contaminated  waste  within  a  closed  and  marked  container  or  in  a marked  plastic  disposal  bag  at  the  unit  contaminated  waste  disposal  point,  or  in  the nearest  work  center  contaminated  waste  disposal  point.    If  transporting  contaminated waste from the work site to another location, place the contaminated waste inside marked plastic bags or closed containers before loading into the vehicle.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 187 16.6.3.3.  Contaminated  buses  move  contaminated  passengers  and  non-contaminated buses  move  non-contaminated  passengers.    However,  there  can  be  times  when insufficient  resources  are  available  for  use  or  mission  dictates  the  prompt  movement  of personnel.  During these times, use caution and place plastic barrier materials on the seats to prevent cross contamination. 16.6.3.4.  Vehicle Contamination Specifics:  There is no machine, kit, team, technique or procedure  presently  capable  of  fulfilling  all  decontamination  requirements.    Depending on the vehicle surface, the agent may absorb into the surface in times ranging from less than 1 minute up to approximately 1 hour.  Vehicle decontamination operations may not have a significant effect once the agent has absorbed into the surface. 16.6.3.5.  Thus,  there  is  no  need  for  extensive  vehicle  decontamination  and  there  is  no need to establish a formal vehicle decontamination team.  Placing barrier materials over the item(s) and, or replacement are the best mitigation techniques. 16.6.3.6.  Vehicles should be expediently decontaminated, specifically the parts that may continuously be touched within 1 hour of contamination. 16.6.3.6.1.  Ensure  vehicles  are  clearly  identified  as  containing  a  residual  chemical hazard.   The  operator’s  or  work  center’s  accomplishment  of  expedient decontamination using M295 IEDK can suffice to continue operations. 16.6.3.6.2.  Use M295 IEDK or a 5-percent chlorine bleach solution to decontaminate appropriate  asset  surfaces  if  more  than  cursory  contact  is  necessary,  i.e.,  leaning  on hood compartment, kneeling in truck bed. 16.6.3.7.  Ensure  all  personnel  are  wearing  the  appropriate  MOPP  level.    Once  cargo loading/unloading is complete, determine the type, location and degree of contamination remaining on the vehicle and ensure to transport personnel to the CCA as required.  The Installation  Control  Center  (ICC)  will  make  the  final  decision  as  to  Mission  Criticality Level (MCL).  (T-1).  See Table 16.1. below for specific levels. Table 16.1.  Mission Criticality Level Codes. Mission Criticality Level Critical Priority Definition Property is sufficiently important that it must be transported within 4 hours, regardless of existence of contamination. Property is sufficiently important that it must be transported within 12 hours, regardless of existence of contamination. Accelerated Property is sufficiently important that it must be transported within 24 hours, regardless of existence of contamination. Routine Mission can be delayed until contamination levels are such that MOPP 4 is not required, regardless of how long it takes the contamination to dissipate.  188 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Negligible Mission can be delayed until there is no measurable indication of contamination; property should not normally be accepted inside property movement area and  save room for higher priority property. 16.6.4.  Clean and Contaminated Cargo Movement. 16.6.4.1.  If  the  transport  vehicle  is  uncontaminated,  take  the  following  precautions  to keep it clean during the contaminated cargo movement process. 16.6.4.1.1.  Expediently decontaminate the portions of the MHE exposed to either the cargo pallet or the transport vehicle (forklift tines and rollers on the aircraft loader).  Use M295 IEDK or 5-percent chlorine bleach solution to decontaminate. 16.6.4.1.2.  Place plastic or another barrier material in the bed of the transport vehicle over the area the cargo sits on. 16.6.4.1.3.  The GMV operator should be the only person in the transport vehicle and must wear the appropriate level of IPE.  (T-1). 16.6.4.1.4.  Local  cargo  handlers  should  perform  the  actual  cargo  loading.    Cargo handlers  should  not  touch  or  stand  on  or  inside  the  vehicle  unless  absolutely necessary. 16.6.4.1.4.1.  If  they  touch  or  stand  on  or  inside  the  vehicle,  they  should  use decontamination troughs containing 5-percent chlorine solutions to decontaminate their gloves and boots before they make contact. 16.6.4.1.5.  Check the clean transport vehicle for evidence of cross-contamination and decontaminate with the M295 decontamination kit if contaminated. 16.6.4.1.6.  Seal  vehicle  chocks or other transport  vehicle accessories that may  have come in contact with contaminated surfaces inside a plastic bag prior to loading. 16.6.4.1.7.

VMS—Vehicle Management Superintendent VOCC—Vehicle Operations Control Center Terms Administrative  Support—Commercial  design  vehicles  used  for  common  support  of installations and personnel.  All DoD sedans and most station wagons are included. Direct  Mission  Support—Commercial  design  vehicles  used  by  military  activities  directly supporting combat or tactical units, or for training of personnel for such activities. Domicile—A place of residence, regardless of where located, excluding TDY residences. Emergency  Response  Forces—A  group  organized  or  available  for  a  certain  purpose  with specialized  vehicles  to  support  the  Air  Force  mission.    Example  would  be  Fire  Department personnel and assigned fire truck or Security Forces personnel and assigned patrol vehicles. Employee—An  employee  of  an  agency  in  either  the  competitive  or  excepted  service  or  an enrollee of the Job Corps established by Title 42 USC § 102. Gross  Vehicle  Weight  Rating  (GVWR)—Is  normally  found  on  the  vehicle/equipment  data plate as GVWR.  The gross vehicle weight rating or gross vehicle mass (GVM) is the maximum operating  weight/mass  of  a  vehicle  as  specified  by  the  manufacturer  including  the  vehicle's chassis, body, engine, engine fluids, fuel, accessories, operator, passengers and cargo. Installation—Real property owned or leased by the United States and under the jurisdiction of one of the DoD Components,  including family  housing designed for rent  for residential  use by civilian  or  military  personnel  of  the  Army,  Navy,  Marine  Corps  or  Air  Force,  and  constructed under the National Housing Act. Installation  Sponsored—Installation  sponsored  is  defined  as  an  activity  approved  by  the installation commander and open/available to the entire installation. Mass  Transportation  Services—Service  for  which  a  fare  is  normally  charged,  meeting requirements beyond shuttle bus services by providing "non-duty" types of transportation within a DoD installation or between sub-installations. Motor  Vehicle  Accident—An occurrence involving  a motor vehicle resulting from a collision with another moving or stationary objects.  Mechanical failures resulting from operator abuse or negligence are not accidents under this definition.  198 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Official Purposes—Any application of a motor vehicle in support of authorized DoD functions, activities or operations. Official  Use—GMVs  are  closely  controlled  because  of  their  easy  accessibility,  high  visibility and  potential  for  misuse.  DoDM  4500.36  implements  federal  law  (e.g.,  31  U.S.C.  §1344 Passenger  Carrier  Use  and  40  U.S.C.  §§601-611,  Motor  Vehicle  Pools  and  Transportation Systems) and prescribes the limited use of GMVs to official governmental purposes. Operations—Those  functions  associated  with  the  organization  responsible  for  administering, planning,  directing  and  controlling  the  assignment  and  movement  of  transportation  equipment and operators in the transporting of personnel and cargo. Operator’s  Inspection  and  Service—Those maintenance inspections and functions performed by the operator, before, during and after operation to ensure the vehicle is safe and serviceable. Reputable  Establishment—An establishment that will not  create a perception that will reflect unfavorably on the DoD or Air Force or cause public criticism no matter what the venue is. Responsive  Manner—Transportation  service  which  is  available  and  capable  of  providing  the traveler  movement  to/from  locations  in  order  to  meet  their  traveling  requirements.    While  a traveler’s  schedule  or  traveling  locations  may  not  allow  for  use  of  public  or  commercial transportation,  travelers  must  make  every  attempt  to  utilize  existing  regularly  scheduled transportation  when  available,  feasible  and  cost  effective.    (T-1).    The  numbers  of  personnel and/or  excess  baggage  are  common  factors  to  be  considered  in  determining  whether  or  not transportation is responsive.  Cost per passenger mile, as defined in AFI 24-301 will be used to determine whether to support using GMVs or other means of transportation support.  (T-1).  As a general rule, the standard airlines definition of excess baggage will apply.  (T-1). Scheduled  DoD  Bus  Services—Scheduled  bus  services  provided  by  DoD  Components,  to include, bus services contracted by DoD Components. Service Animal—Service animals are not considered pets.  They are trained to perform tasks for people with disabilities, either physical or psychological in nature. Shuttle  Service—This  fare-free  service  is  established  to  meet  DoD  requirements  and  operates only in duty areas. Space-Available  (Space  A)—Any  seating  available  after  accommodating  space  required passengers.    The  vehicle  size  or  contract  cost  will  not  be  increased  to  accommodate  space- available personnel (i.e., if space is required for three passengers to attend an official function a bus cannot be scheduled for use to transport additional Space-A passengers desiring transport to the same or nearby destination).  (T-0). U-Drive-It (UDI)—Vehicles available to using organizations and activities of the installation for temporary support of official functions and operated by personnel assigned to the using agency in  support  of  home-station  missions,  contingencies,  TDY  support  and  combat  service  support operations.  Support is normally limited to 72 hours, but can be approved for up to 60 days.  A UDI  dispatch  will  not  exceed  60  days  total  duration.    (T-1).    Back-to-back  dispatches  are  not authorized in order to circumvent 60 consecutive days. Vehicle Abuse—Damage caused by neglect or willful acts of improper operation or care.  AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 199 Vehicle  Misuse—Use  of  GMVs,  including  those  rented  or  leased,  for  any  purpose  other  than that  of  official  purposes  only  (e.g.,  in  support  of  authorized  DoD  functions,  activities,  or operations).  Vehicle misuse includes, but is not limited to, use of a GMV solely to enhance the comfort or convenience of member(s), or transportation by a GMV for reasons of rank, position, prestige or personal convenience. Vehicle  Fleet—Vehicles  assigned  to  provide  transportation  services  and  for  temporary  use  by other organizations.   200 AFMAN24-306  9 DECEMBER 2016 Attachment 2 INTERNATIONAL MILITARY ROUTE SIGNS, TRAFFIC CONTROL VISUAL SIGNALS, AND CONTROL SIGNALS FOR MILITAR VEHICLES IN CONVOYS A2.1.
