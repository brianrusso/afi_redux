(T-1). 1.7.2.5.  Coordinating unit manpower and equipment issues for the Prime BEEF Manager in support of the Prime BEEF Program.  (T-1). 1.7.3.  The  Prime  BEEF  Manager  will  manage  and  document  all  Prime  BEEF  related requirements  (personnel,  training,  equipment,  etc.)  utilizing  the  ACES  PR  module.    (T-1).  As a critical component of a unit’s contingency program, actions should be taken  to  ensure recorded  data  in  ACES  PR  is  up  to  date.    The  Prime  BEEF  Manager  has  primary responsibility, while the Primary/Alternate UDM(s) and functional SMEs provide inputs for their specific Air Force Specialty (AFS) requirements, to update ACES PR. 1.7.4.  Commanders/civilian leaders, with  support from  their MAJCOMs, must program  for and  implement  recurring  training  opportunities  for  key  personnel  to  ensure  Prime  BEEF program  effectiveness.    This  training  includes  Prime  BEEF  Program  Management  and  all additional training requirements listed in AFIs 10-403, AFI 10-244, AFI 10-201, and AFI 10-252.  (T-3). 1.7.5.  UTC  management  guidelines  have  been  established  for  implementation  of  the  UTC Management program, which can be found in AFPAM 10-219, Volume 8. 1.8.  Observations, Innovations, and Lessons (OIL).  All squadron commanders deployed to a contingency  location  must  submit  an  after  action  report  (AAR)  no  later  than  30  days  prior  to   8  AFI10-210  21 JANUARY 2015 departure from the deployed location.   (T-1).  AARs are submitted through the Air Force-Joint Lessons  Learned  Information  System  (AF-JLLIS)  web-based  reporting  tool  using  “AAR Builder.” (OIC)/noncommissioned  officers-in-charge 1.8.1.  All deployed squadron commanders, Facility Engineer Team/Detachment officers-in-charge (NCOIC),  Utility  Detachment OICs/NCOICs, and individual augmentees are encouraged to submit individual OILs as they are encountered during their deployment rather than waiting to consolidate all OILs in AARs.  AFCEC should immediately act upon and disseminate submitted OILs.  Individual OILs are submitted on the AF-JLLIS website using the “Add an Observation” form. 1.8.2.  All civil engineers are encouraged to submit pre-deployment training (e.g., CST, etc.) OILs.  These are submitted using the “Add an Observation” form on the AF-JLLIS website. 1.8.3.  Unclassified  AARs  and  individual  observations  are  submitted  via  the  AF-JLLIS NIPRNET  weblink  at:    https://www.jllis.mil/USAF  and  classified  items  are  submitted  via the AF-JLLIS SIPRNET weblink:  http://www.jllis.smil.mil/usaf. AFI10-210  21 JANUARY 2015   9  Chapter 2 PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND REQUIREMENTS 2.1.  Objectives.  The objectives of the Prime BEEF program are to: 2.1.1.  Develop and maintain a highly skilled, agile military combat support CE force capable of rapid response in support of AEF and other worldwide contingency operations. 2.1.2.  Develop  and  maintain  highly  skilled,  in-place  CE  forces  as  postured  in  DOC statements to support continental United States (CONUS) and theater forces. 2.1.3.  Provide  an  adequate  force  structure,  as  postured  in  DOC  statements,  to  support wartime mobility and CONUS/theater sustaining mission requirements. 2.2.  Requirements. 2.2.1.  Units  will  develop  their  Prime  BEEF  program  to  ensure  CE  personnel  can  meet operations plan (OPLAN) taskings, impromptu contingency taskings within unit capabilities, and  other  unit-specific  deployment  requirements.    (T-1).    Taskings  may  include  support  to Combatant Commands, Joint or Combined Task Forces, and AEFs. 2.2.2.  Basic  CE  contingency  missions  include  force  beddown  of  AF  units  and  weapons systems;  Joint  service  requirements;  operation  and  maintenance  of  AF  facilities, infrastructure,  and  installations;  FES;  command  and  control  (C2)  of  CE  forces;  emergency repair  of  air  bases  to  include  airfield  damage  and  utility  repairs;  construction  management; rendering safe and disposal of explosive ordnance; and monitoring and protecting resources subject  to  the  “All  Hazards”  of  threats  from  major  accidents,  natural  disasters,  improvised explosive  devices,  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  and  enemy/terrorist  use  of  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN).  S-Teams provide engineering management, technical design, construction management, C2 as well as staff augmentation to war fighting headquarters  and  other  echelon  above  Wing  level  organizations.    Civil  engineers  execute these missions with in-place forces or by deploying the proper types and quantities of Prime BEEF UTCs designed  for these missions.  Specific capabilities for each Prime BEEF  UTC are described in its Mission Capability (MISCAP) statement. 2.2.3.  MAJCOMs  posture  (posturing  is  the  act  of  converting  the  unit  manpower  document [UMD] into UTCs) Prime BEEF forces at their bases for worldwide deployment via mobility UTCs that primarily concentrate on supporting aircraft and combat operations. 2.2.4.  Civilian  CE  forces  are  used  for  in-place  employment  to  support  operations  at  home station.  In the event military forces are deployed, commanders/civilian leaders must ensure civilian forces are trained, equipped, and available to support the remaining mission-essential requirements.  (T-1).  In-place forces must be prepared to employ contract support, augment with with any assigned Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMA), employ AFCAP, or use military or civilian resources from other AF locations to meet the in-place mission depending on  the  extent  and  duration  of  the  contingency.    (T-1).    Also  see  the  installation’s  Civil Engineer Contingency Response Plan. 2.2.5.  The  War  and  Mobilization  Plan  (WMP-1),  Civil  Engineer  Supplement,  provides general  wartime  operating  and  planning  guidance.    OPLANs  delineate  specific  theater   10  AFI10-210  21 JANUARY 2015 concepts  and  requirements.    The  WMP-1,  CE  Supplement,  is  located  on  the  AFCEC Expeditionary  Engineering  SharePoint  site  at:    https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-EN-CE-A6/21340/default.aspx.  Users must request access through the SharePoint administrator. 2.2.6.  To  support  crisis/contingency  operations  and  AEF  deployments,  MAJCOMs  will posture all funded authorized operational (unit) level military positions in UTCs as described in  the  paragraphs  below.    The  AF  goal  is  for  every  unit  and  installation  to  create  the maximum  number  of  deployable  teams  their  UMDs  can  support  and  then  to  make  those UTCs available  for  AEF deployments.   All  military personnel  in  a CE unit can be selected for steady state and OPLAN taskings. 2.2.6.1.  When posturing UTCs, the parent MAJCOM will determine the best use of unit authorizations  to  meet  the  most  stringent  OPLAN  demands  and  maintain  flexibility  to support  AEF  steady  state  requirements.    MAJCOMs  are  authorized  to  change  a  Prime BEEF UTC commitment to a different unit, but must obtain approval through AF/A4CX. 2.2.6.2.  MAJCOMs  will  posture  UTCs  at  each  unit  using  the  building  block  approach outlined in AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution, and the WMP-1, CE Supplement. 2.2.6.2.1.  Step 1:  Posture Personnel UTCs listed in Table  2.1.  Posture the number of each type UTC IAW the MISCAPs required to support OPLAN taskings. Table 2.1.  Building Block Personnel UTCs UTC SERIES  UTC  Beddown  FES  EM  EOD  4FPET, 4FPES, 4FPAL, 4FPAN, 4FPAM, 4FPAP, 4FPAR, 4FPAX, 4FPSG, 4FPSD, 4FPSC, 4FPSB  4FPFF, 4FPFG, 4FPFJ, 4FPFN, 4FPFP  4FPWF, 4FPWB, 4FPWC, 4FPWD, 4FPWE  4FPXG, 4FPXB, 4FPXC, 4FPXD, 4FPXE, 4FPXF, 4FPXH  2.2.6.2.2.  Step  2:    AFCEC  provides  guidance  to  MAJCOMs  on  how  to  create, register,  and  posture  specialized  and  MAJCOM-unique  UTCs  required  to  support OPLAN taskings.  To the maximum extent possible CE UTCs should be applicable to the AF CE community as a whole with very few MAJCOM-unique UTC exceptions. 2.2.6.2.3.  Step  3:    When  resources  are  available,  build  additional  numbers  of  the UTCs in Table 2.1. 2.2.6.2.4.  Step 4:  Use the following UTCs to cover authorizations that do not fit into teams in Step 3:  4FPAK, 4FPAQ, 4FPAS, 4FPAT, 4FPAU, 4FPAV, 4FPAW, 4FPS6 and 4FPSC. 2.2.6.2.5.  Step 5:  Posture all remaining 3EXXX and 32EX military positions (those residual  positions  that  cannot  fit  in  one  of  the  UTCs  in  Steps  1,  2,  3,  and  4)  into 4FZZZ UTCs that match current AEF alignment. 2.2.6.2.6.  Step 6:  Assign posturing codes IAW AFI 10-401 to each UTC to establish the availability of the UTC teams. AFI10-210  21 JANUARY 2015   11  2.2.7.  The  MEFPAK  system  (as  described  in  AFI  10-401)  contains  Prime  BEEF  UTCs under  the  alphanumeric  series  "4F***."    The  Manpower  Force  Packaging  System (MANFOR) component of the MEFPAK contains MISCAP statements and manpower force element  listings  for  each  UTC,  while  the  Logistics  Force  Packaging  System  (LOGFOR) component  of  MEFPAK  contains  the  UTC  Logistics  Detail  (LOGDET)  for  equipment  and supplies.  AFCEC/CXX will use the ESL as the source document for the LOGFOR database when building the LOGDET IAW AFI 10-401. 2.2.8.  Prime BEEF personnel must maintain security clearances IAW AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management. 2.3.  Project  Approval.  A  unit’s  Prime  BEEF  construction,  maintenance  and  repair  activities will  meet  appropriate  project  programming  requirements  and  approval  levels,  as  identified  in AFI  32-1032,  Planning  and  Programming  Appropriated  Fund  Maintenance,  Repair,  and Construction Projects.  Work accomplished by Prime BEEF forces must be executed and tracked IAW  the  standardized  work  prioritization  system  outlined  in  AFI  32-1001,  Operations Management.  These restrictions apply to active, guard, and reserve forces.  See Joint Publication (JP) 3-34, Joint Engineer Operations, for project approval procedures while deployed on a joint or  combined  contingency  operation.    CE  commanders/civilian  leaders  should  coordinate  with higher headquarters (e.g., Commander, AF Forces or Component Command staffs) for Area of Responsibility (AOR) project approval procedures.   12  AFI10-210  21 JANUARY 2015 Chapter 3 PERSONNEL 3.1.  Assigning  People  to  UTCs.  AFI  10-403  provides  the  general  rules  for  assigning individuals to fill UTC requirements for deployment/employment purposes.  Prime BEEF units will adhere to the following rules: 3.1.1.  FES substitutions must be tied to DOD fire certified skills.  (T-0). 3.1.2.  Colonel  (O-6),  3E000,  3E700,  3E800,  and  3E900  positions  cannot  be  filled  by  a person with a lower grade or skill level, unless allowed by the MISCAP.  (T-1). 3.1.3.  Officer  positions  may  be  filled  by  individuals  holding  any  educational  suffix.  Exception: 32E3H (EOD) requirements must be filled by a qualified officer possessing the correct duty AFSC and grade.  (T-1). 3.1.4.  Authorized AFS substitutions are listed in Table 3.1.  (T-1).

Prime  BEEF  forces  will  train  to  meet  a  full  range  of  tasks  expected  in  a contingency environment.  (T-1).  These tasks are contained in each Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) and in this Instruction.  This Instruction and the Wartime Task Standard (located  on  the  AFCEC  EE  SharePoint  site  at  https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-EN-CE-A6/21340/default.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fsites%2FOO%2DEN%2DCE%2DA6%2F21340%2FAFKN%5FDocs%2F01%20Contingency%20Trg%2FCE%20Wartime%20Task%20Standards&FolderCTID=0x012000230962705876344DBD7B0570E2984E45&View={7E4DC30D-1E9D-4142-A94E-7F57C48B3C96}) are the source documents for Prime BEEF training.  All  Prime  BEEF  training  requirements  are  vetted  and  approved  through  the  CE  Governance Structure (see paragraph 1.4). 4.2.  Applicability.  Military personnel assigned to active, reserve, and guard CE units and civil engineers  assigned  to  the  49th  Material  Maintenance  Group  (MMG)  will  train  to  standards identified in paragraph 4.3.  (T-1).  Institutional Forces (IF), such as Headquarters, FOA, Direct Reporting  Unit  (DRU),  S-Teams,  and  IMA  civil  engineers  will  receive,  at  a  minimum,  the ancillary  training  requirements  listed  in  AFI  10-403.    This  training  is  conducted  as  required  or just-in-time  (JIT)  prior  to  deploying.    Civilian  personnel  assigned  to  deployable  UTCs  and civilians identified to  provide wartime home station  support will meet  training requirements  as defined by the parent MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU.  (T-3). 4.3.  Requirements.  Military  personnel  assigned  to  base  level  CE  units  are  required  to  attend HST, mission essential equipment training (MEET), and SF IAW training tables in Attachments 2-6.  (T-1).  Pre-deployment training requirements are defined in reporting instructions and unit line remarks. 4.3.1.  HST  Requirements.    HST  requirements  are  identified  in  the  HST  training  table  in Attachment  2.  HST includes knowledge-based and hands-on training.  Units should make every effort to incorporate realism into their respective HST programs.  Field gear (to include primary weapons) should be used whenever training requirements such as security activities, convoy  operations,  defensive  fighting  positions,  etc.  are  accomplished.    IF  will  accomplish HST upon deployment notification.  (T-1). 4.3.1.1.  Training  Delivery.    Units  should  use  computer  based  training  (CBT),  lesson plans, or other multimedia training packages available on the CE Virtual Learning Center (CE VLC at  https://afcesa.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp) and the EE SharePoint site.  CBT products can be used in a classroom setting to train as many personnel as possible.  Attendance is documented on a sign-in roster and maintained IAW paragraph 4.4. 4.3.1.2.  MAJCOMs  may  direct  additional  command-required  training  to  maintain optimum readiness levels. 4.3.2.  MEET  Requirements.    MEET  training  requirements  are  identified  in  Attachment  4.  Wartime  or  contingency  environments  often  involve  the  use  of  specialized  and  unique mission-essential equipment civil engineers do not use in their day-to-day operations.  Due to cost  and  complexity,  mission-essential  contingency  equipment  and  trainer  expertise  are  not commonly  found  at  CONUS  installations.    However,  inadequate  training  on  these  key AFI10-210  21 JANUARY 2015   15  equipment  items  can  negatively  impact  AF  contingency  operations.    Individuals  will  be trained  to  the  proficiency  level  prescribed  in  the  approved  MEET  curriculum  to  set  up, operate, trouble shoot, maintain, and reconstitute equipment IAW Prime BEEF/Contingency Training  Panel  approved  objectives.    (T-1).    Where  local  training  capabilities  do  not  exist, specialty training sites can be utilized.  A list of training sites can be found in Attachment 7.  SF  training  does  not  meet  the  requirement  for  MEET  training.    Although  the  MEET  table identifies the minimum number of personnel to be trained, units should make every effort to train and certify personnel who could be tasked as alternates to fill a critical position. 4.3.3.  SF  Exercise  Training  Requirements.    SF  exercise  training  is  required  for  all  UTCs listed in the SF training table in Attachment 5.  Note:  Only those individuals who complete specific AFSC SF training can receive SF exercise training credit.  (Exception:  paragraphs 4.6.1.3  and  4.6.1.4  criteria  for  MAJCOM  Civil  Engineers  to  grant  SF  exercise  training  to units under specific circumstances).  SF exercise training is scheduled through AFCEC/CXX.  MAJCOMs  will  coordinate  SF  exercise  training  requirements  when  the  official  data  call  is sent out from AFCEC/CXX. 4.3.4.  CST Requirements.  CST needs to be institutionalized as an integral part of any HST program.    OILs  have  taught  us  the  importance  of  maintaining  a  higher  level  of  combat readiness.  Although the inclusion of combat skills-focused training into HST does not fully prepare  CE  personnel  to  work  in  a  high  threat  combat  environment,  the  steps  taken  to enhance  training  help  to  elevate  units  to  a  readiness  level  capable  of  supporting  safe  and effective operations in  low to  medium  threat  combat  environments.   Personnel  identified to deploy in support of high threat joint taskings require completion of a higher level CST than can be provided through HST.  Although some elements of CST are possible at home station, the  overwhelming  majority  of  tasks  (convoy  operations  with  live  fire,  combat  lifesaver training, etc.) require special resources, provisions, and other environmental considerations to administer and subsequently trained at a Combat Skills Specialty Training Site such as Army PPPs.  To minimize time spent at CST, civil engineers will complete all HST requirements prior to going to CST.  (T-1).  CST requirements are typically identified through the Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD) and scheduled through AFCEC/CXX. 4.3.5.  S-Team  Training  Requirements.   In addition to  HST, S-Team  UTC 4FPS6 will train on the topics listed in the S-Team training table in Attachment 6.  (T-1). 4.3.6.  Government  Vehicle  and  Equipment  Operations  Training.    All  military  Prime  BEEF personnel  need  to  have  a  valid  state  motor  vehicle  license  IAW  AFI  24-301,  Vehicle Operations, and be licensed on their government driver’s license to operate the vehicles and equipment identified in the vehicle/equipment table in Attachment 3.  (T-1). 4.4.  Documentation.  The  Prime  BEEF  Manager  will  document  Prime  BEEF  training  using ACES  PR.    (T-1).    IAW  AFI  36-2201,  Air  Force  Training  Program,  deploying  personnel  will hand-carry their training record, unless pre-approved through the Personnel Readiness Function so personnel can access their training record at the deployed location.  Upon permanent change of station, transfer the training record to  the  gaining unit (ACES  PR can automatically transfer the  record  when  the  member  signs  in  to  their  new  unit).    The  Prime  BEEF  Manager  will document training administered through the Prime BEEF program IAW guidelines established in the RDS.  Data is used to periodically verify the currency of information in ACES PR.   16  AFI10-210  21 JANUARY 2015 4.5.  SORTS.  Attachments  2,  4,  5  &  6 identify SORTS reportable training tasks.   Note:  The SORTS-reportable requirements are neither the minimum nor the total training requirements for a unit.  Units must conduct training frequently enough to be able to perform all tasks associated with its UTC MISCAPs.  (T-1).  Exceptions: 4.5.1.  For  SORTS  measurement,  a  unit  commander/civilian  leader  may  temporarily  waive overdue training for deployed personnel for up to 60 days after they return to home station. 4.5.2.  Unit commanders/civilians leaders may give credit for applicable HST to individuals who  performed  the  required  tasks  during  contingency  or  exercise  deployments  with  proper documentation of training IAW paragraph 4.4.  Use the return date from the deployment as the training completion date. 4.5.3.  To obtain SF credit, staff approval requests to AFCEC/CX at least 30 days prior to the start  of  the  training  event.    AFCEC/CX  is  the  final  authority  regarding  SF  credit  and  only considers  training  events  that  include  current  SF  training  requirements  conducted  in  a collective environment as a suitable substitute.  Exceptions: 4.5.3.1.  A  MAJCOM  Civil  Engineer  can  allow  a  unit  to  take  credit  for  SF  exercise training  for  individuals  who  deploy  as  a  team  in  support  of  contingency  beddown operations  (not  sustainment/steady-state  operations)  with  proper  documentation  of training  IAW  paragraph  4.4.    Use  the  return  date  from  the  deployment  as  the  training completion date. 4.5.3.2.  If  the  MAJCOM  Civil  Engineer  determines  that  individuals  who  competed  in Readiness Challenge met SF exercise training requirements a unit may take SF exercise training  credit  for  those  personnel.    Use  the  final  day  of  competition  as  the  training completion date. AFI10-210  21 JANUARY 2015   17  Chapter 5 EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES 5.1.  Mobility  Equipment  and  Supplies.  Unit  commanders/civilian  leaders  will  equip  their Prime BEEF forces based on those UTCs directed to be postured.  (T-1). three 5.1.1.  Requirements,  Documents  and  Databases. documents/databases to  manage UTC equipment and supplies; ESL,  AS,  and the  LOGFOR packaging  system.    These  documents  and  databases  define  equipment  and  supply requirements,  provide  authorization  for  accountable  equipment  items,  and  information  for building the LOGDET.   The  CE  community  uses 5.1.1.1.  The  ESL  source  document  is  generated  from  the  ACES  PR  Reference  Data Manager (RDM) database, which provides the authoritative source document for all CE UTC  equipment  requirements.    The  RDM  is  also  the  only  source  for  details  on  how  to report  equipment  items  in  SORTS.    This  document  enables  the  CE  community  to standardize  requirements  between  UTCs  and  is  the  primary  document  used  to  conduct annual inventories and forecast funding for those UTCs.  The RDM is also the source that updates  all  equipment  and  supply  items  in  the  ACES  PR  database.    Units  will  conduct inventories  and  inspections  annually  and/or  after  deployments/exercises  comparing  the on-hand assets to the ESLs and the results will be updated in ACES PR.   (T-1).  When shortages in wartime equipment are noted, units should take immediate action to budget for and acquire missing items.  The approved ESL is reviewed every three years and can be found in ACES PR.  For information on the ESL change process see AFPAM 10-219, Volume 8, Attachment 4. 5.1.1.2.  ASs  provide  authorizations  for  units  to  acquire  accountable  equipment  items listed in the ESL. 5.1.1.3.  The  LOGFOR  packaging  system  contains  the  pallet  load  and  packing  list information for  each UTC.  AFCEC/CXX will ensure the  LOGFOR/LOGDET includes all items as listed in the latest approved ESL.  (T-1). 5.1.2.  Personal Clothing.  Each military member assigned to a deployable UTC will maintain the clothing and accessories listed in the applicable mobility bag ESL.  (T-1).  Each military member assigned to  an associated UTC and each civilian member assigned to a deployable UTC should be encouraged to  maintain an equivalent personal  bag.  Until  activation, ANG personnel require only those uniform items prescribed in AFI 36-3014, Clothing Allowances for Air Force Personnel. 5.1.3.  Mobility  Bags.    Each  person  assigned  to  a  standard  deployable  UTC  requires  one general purpose bag (A-bag), one extreme cold weather bag (B-bag), one CE specific issued items bag (X-Bag) and one CBRN individual protective equipment bag (C-1 bag for non-fire fighters, C-1 Joint-Firefighter's Integrated Response Ensemble [J-FIRE] bag for fire fighters).  The ESL lists mobility bag requirements.  A-bag items  are  listed in  AFI  23-101, Air Force Materiel  Management.    X-Bag  items  will  be  budgeted  for,  stored,  and  maintained  by  each CE unit.  (T-1).  Base supply will maintain the standard bags.  Exceptions:  (1) Each person assigned to  an EOD UTC will be issued and maintain  the mobility bags  except  for the C-1 bag  listed  in  the  ESL.    (T-1).    Units  provide  the  EOD  individual  equipment/unit  retention   18  AFI10-210  21 JANUARY 2015 items  through  the  Battlefield  Airman  Management  System  (BAMS)  or  its  replacement system.    (2)  Mobility  bags  are  not  required  for  personnel  assigned  to  critical  homestation operations UTC(s) (DX/AX) IAW AFI 10-401. 5.1.4.  Special Protective Clothing.  Units will maintain properly sized protective clothing for each  Pest  Management  (AFSC  3E4X3)  and  FES  (AFSC  3E7X1)  technician  assigned  to  a Prime BEEF deployable UTC.  (T-1).  Units will also maintain arc flash gear/cotton Airman Battle  Uniforms  (if  cotton  uniforms  are  not  available,  100  percent  cotton  coveralls  will suffice)  for  each  Electrician  (AFSC  3E0X1),  Power  Production  (AFSC  3E0X2),  HVAC  & Refrigeration  (AFSC  3E1X1)  and  Water  and  Fuels  Systems  Maintenance  (AFSC  3E4X1) technician  assigned  to  a  standard  Prime  BEEF  deployable  UTC.    (T-1).    EOD  (AFSC 3E8X1)  units  will  maintain  properly  sized  multi-cams  protective  clothing  for  use  during explosive operations at deployed locations.  (T-1).  Individuals holding these specialties who are assigned to UTCs will deploy with properly sized special protective clothing as listed in the ESL and EOD personnel will use BAMS or its replacement system as a means of issue and inventory control of all personnel retention gear.   (T-1).  Other civil engineers will use ACES PR Equipment Checkout to document receipt of personal protection equipment items and  accountability  is  maintained  by  the  issuing  UDM  or  Prime  BEEF  Manager  through documented annual inventory inspections.  (T-3).  The inspections are useful in determining unit  needs  for  maintaining  an  inventory  of  protective  clothing  and  equipment  for  issue, recurring  replacement  costs,  and  to  ensure  periodic  inspection  and  associated  maintenance procedures are being accomplished. 5.1.5.  Team  and  Tool  Kits.    Prime  BEEF  UTCs  will  include  the  full  complement  of  team and  Consolidated  Tool  Kits  IAW  the  ESL.    (T-1).    ASs  429,  456,  459,  490,  538,  and  660 contain equipment authorizations for Prime BEEF UTCs. 5.1.6.  Weapons and Ammunition.  The primary duty weapon for civil engineers is the M-4.  Each  person  assigned  to  a  DW  or  DP  (OCONUS  only)  coded  UTC  requires  one  M-4  rifle and 210 rounds of ammunition  unless directed otherwise by the mission/MAJCOM.   (T-1).  Each  rifle  requires  seven  30-round  magazines.    Headquarters  staff  augmentation,  Civil Engineer  Maintenance,  Inspection,  and  Repair  Teams,  and  airfield  pavements  evaluation UTCs may optionally equip using pistols only; however, this does not relieve these units of having the M-4s.  EXCEPTIONS:  Weapons and ammunition are not required for people in DX  and  AX  coded  UTCs.    As  with  mobility  bags,  individuals  in  these  positions  share weapons and ammunition with the DP, DW and AW authorized positions.  All EOD UTCs (DP, DX, and DW) require M-4 rifles and M-9 pistols. 5.1.6.1.  Additionally,  commander  s  may  authorize  pistols  and  accompanying ammunition for cargo couriers, armory guards, or other such duties where the M-4 would hinder operations. 5.1.6.2.  Table  5  1 lists the maximum number of rifles and pistols authorized per UTC.  For  weapons  and  demolition  munitions  authorizations,  refer  to  AS  538  and  Ground Munitions  Authorization  Tables  (GMAT)  located  on  the  Global  Ammunition  Control Point accessible at https://www.my.af.mil/ammoprod/wm/.  IAW GMAT, Prime BEEF Managers and/or MAJCOMs when applicable, will forecast annually for mobility ground ammunition (5.56 mm and 9 mm) for all Prime BEEF requirements (including EOD). AFI10-210  21 JANUARY 2015   19  5.1.7.  Tactical  Communications  Systems.    Prime  BEEF  UTCs  are  authorized  DOD mandated  Joint  Tactical  Radio  System  (JTRS)  communications  equipment  IAW  AS  660, which are maintained in a readiness status at Grissom AR, IN.  Note:  EOD JTRS assets are maintained at home station. 5.2.  Prime  BEEF  Home  Station  Field  Training  Sets.  AS 429LOOJ authorizes field training sets  which  allow  Prime  BEEF  teams  to  participate  in  field  training  and  local  base  exercises.  Field training sets consist of items such as tents, generators, various BEAR electrical equipment items, and environmental control units. 5.3.  CONUS-Sustaining  and  Theater  In-Place  Equipment  Requirements.  CONUS-sustaining  and  theater  in-place  CE  forces  will  meet  equipment  requirements  as  determined  by their parent MAJCOM.  (T-1). 5.4.  Equipment Status Reporting. 5.4.1.  Units will report equipment status IAW AFI 10-201. 5.4.2.  A  MAJCOM  can  direct  command-unique  reporting  requirements  for  equipment.    A MAJCOM must develop the unique instructions  for each  reporting sub-area to  be used  and coordinate  those  instructions  with  AF/A4CX  and  AFCEC/CX.    This  coordination  ensures AF/A4CX and AFCEC/CX is aware of the special requirements and ensures standardization of like requirements. 5.5.  War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Asset Management.  CE units will manage WRM assets IAW AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures.   20  AFI10-210  21 JANUARY 2015  Table 5.1.

If  weapons are centrally stored and maintained on a single account managed by the Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS), then weapons fall under LRS for SORTS reporting. Note 2:  Both required by the ESL and authorized by AS 538. Note 3:  At commander’s discretion, UTC may also be M-9-armed, but this doesn’t replace requirements for M-4s for force protection. Note 4:  At the commander’s/civilian leader’s discretion or deployed commander’s request (in the form of a line remark) and IAW deployed location reporting instructions, units may additionally equip officers and enlisted personnel on these UTCs with M-9s.  This doesn’t replace the requirement for M-4s for force protection.  Note 5:  EOD UTC weapons requirements also include the M-107, M-240, and M-249. AFI10-210  21 JANUARY 2015   21  Chapter 6 ANG AND AFRC 6.1.  Applicability.  ANG  and  AFRC  CE  units  and  their  Prime  BEEF  teams  will  operate according to Chapter 1 through Chapter 5, with the following exception:  All references to the BCE should be interpreted as ANG or AFRC CE unit commander.  (T-1). 6.2.  Training  Deployments.  AFCEC/CX  will  be  the  functional  manager  on  behalf  of AF/A4CX  for  scheduling  and  coordinating  ARC  training  deployments  in  support  of  active MAJCOM, Numbered Air Force (NAF), and Combatant Commander (CCDR) requirements, and humanitarian and civic assistance projects.  (T-1). 6.2.1.  AFCEC/CX  will  issue  a  call  letter  to  MAJCOMs,  NAFs,  and  CCDRs  in  January  of each  year.    (T-1).    The  letter  includes  requirements,  procedures,  and  any  other  instructions for requesting ARC Prime BEEF support.  MAJCOMs and CE units need to consider support for Operations Flight, FES Flight, EOD Flight, and the R&EM Flight.  AFRC will provide a list of preferred training requirements for the year to meet training shortfalls for all AFSCs to assist units with understanding the support required. 6.2.2.  MAJCOMs, NAFs, and CCDRs will validate and consolidate their requirements into a prioritized list and submit the list to AFCEC/CX by 1 April of each year.  JUDITH A.

It is the foundational and crosscutting USAF system of support that  enables AF operational  concepts  and the capabilities that distinguish  air and space power-speed, flexibility, and global perspective. (Annex 4-0) Area  of  Responsibility (AOR)—The geographical area associated with a combatant command within which a CCDR has authority to plan and conduct operations. (Joint Publication (JP) 1-02, DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms) Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR)—A critical ACS capability. It provides vital equipment and supplies necessary to beddown and support combat forces at expeditionary sites with  limited  infrastructure  and  support  facilities.  As  a  minimum,  each  location  must  have  a runway and parking ramp suitable for aircraft operations and a source of water that can be made potable. Contingency—An  emergency  involving  military  forces  caused  by  natural  disasters,  terrorists, subversives,  or  by  required  military  operations.  Due  to  the  uncertainty  of  the  situation, contingencies require plans, rapid response, and special procedures to ensure the safety and the readiness of personnel, installations, and equipment. (JP 1-02) Designed  Operational  Capabilities  (DOC)  Statement—Document  prepared  by  a  parent MAJCOM  that  outlines  each  measured  unit's  capabilities  and  contains  the  unit's  identification, mission  tasking  narrative,  mission  specifics,  and  measurable  resources.  The  DOC  statement  is   28  AFI10-210  21 JANUARY 2015 used for the purposes of organizing, training and equipping the unit. It is not a tasking document for crisis operations (See MISCAP). Emergency—Essential Civilian Employee—A direct-hire US citizen civilian employee who is appointed, either temporarily or permanently, to an emergency-essential DOD position. Explosive Ordnance—All munitions containing explosives, nuclear fission or fusion materials, and  biological  and  chemical  agents.    This  includes  bombs  and  warheads;  guided  and  ballistic missiles; artillery, mortar, rocket, and small arms ammunitions; all mines, torpedoes, and depth charges;  demolition  charges;  pyrotechnics;  clusters  and  dispensers;  cartridge  and  propellant actuated  devices;  electro-explosive  devices;  clandestine  and  improvised  explosive  devices;  and all similar or related items or components explosive in nature.

Individual  mobilization  augmentees  train  on  a  part-time  basis  with  these organizations  to  prepare  for  mobilization.  Inactive  duty  training  for  IMAs  is  decided  by component policy and can vary from 0 to 48 drills a year. (JP 1-02) Logistics  Force  Packaging  Systems  (LOGFOR)—A  MEFPAK  subsystem  that  provides equipment  and  materiel  requirements  and  summarized  transportation  characteristics  through  its Logistics Detail component. Logistics  Module  (LOGMOD)—Automates  the  development  and  distribution  of  UTC packages.  At  the  Installation/Wing  level,  it  provides  the  capability  to  schedule,  monitor,  and control movement of cargo and personnel via air or surface modes of transportation. Used at all levels of command. It is used to analyze and approve UTC equipment detail, build the MEFPAK report, and update standard UTCs in Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES). Used  at  MAJCOM  level  to  analyze  and  approve  UTC  equipment  detail  and  to  report  tailored UTCs  to  JOPES.  LOGMOD  is  used  at  squadron/unit  level  UDMs  to  track  unit  personnel readiness and for selection of cargo and personnel to fulfill UTC requirements. Manpower  Force  Packaging  System  (MANFOR)—Subsystem  of  MEFPAK.  For  each  unit type  code  it  provides:  (1)  The  title  of  the  unit  or  force  element,  and  its  unique  Joint  Chiefs  of Staff UTC. (2) The mission capability statement that contains the definition of unit capability. (3) The manpower detail by function, grade (officers only), and AFSC required to meet the defined capability. Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK)—A data system designed to support contingency and general war planning with pre-defined and standardized manpower and equipment force packages.  MEFPAK operates in the command and control environment and is composed of two subsystems: the MANFOR and the LOGFOR. Mission  Capability  Statement  (MISCAP)—A  short  paragraph  describing  the  mission capabilities that planners expect of a specific UTC at execution.  The statement usually contains pertinent  information  such  as  the  type  of  base  where  commanders/civilian  leaders  deploy  the unit,  the  unit's  functional  activities,  and  other  augmentation  requirements  necessary  to  conduct specific missions. AFI10-210  21 JANUARY 2015   29  Operation  Plan  (OPLAN)—A  plan  for  one  or  more  operations  that  deployed  units  carry  out simultaneously or in a series of connected stages. Higher authorities normally issue OPLANs as directives based on stated assumptions to allow subordinate officers to prepare supporting plans and orders. Unit Deployment Manager (UDM)—The UDM is a member assigned to a unit that manages all deployment  readiness  and  training  aspects  for  all  deployable  personnel  and  equipment  within their unit to ensure they are deployment ready. In addition, UDMs support redeployed personnel in the Redeployment Support Process with commanders/civilian leaders of their units. Unit  Type  Code  (UTC)—A  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  developed  and  assigned  code,  consisting  of five characters that uniquely identify a “type unit.” (JP 1-02) War  and  Mobilization  Plan  (WMP)—The  AF  supporting  plan  to  the  Joint  Strategic Capabilities  Plan.  The  five  volumes  of  the  WMP  extend  through  the  Future  Years’  Defense Program  to  provide  continuity  in  short-  and  mid-range  war  and  mobilization  planning.  It provides  current  planning  cycle  policies  and  planning  factors  for  the  conduct  and  support  of wartime  operations.  The  WMP  encompasses  all  functions  necessary  to  match  facilities, manpower, and materiel with planned wartime activity.    30  AFI10-210  21 JANUARY 2015 Attachment 2 PRIME BEEF HOME STATION TRAINING (HST) A2.1.  General Contingency Responsibilities. A2.1.1.  Upon  assignment  to  the  unit,  commanders/civilian  leaders  will  ensure  all  military personnel  receive  Prime  BEEF  training.    (T-1).    This  training  should  emphasize  the individual's role and how they fit into the program.  It includes an overview of CE Doctrine and  explains  the  organization,  training,  equipment,  operating  concepts,  and  contingency missions  pertaining  to  the  unit.    The  Prime  BEEF  Manager  updates  unit  personnel  on significant changes to the programs as they occur. A2.1.2.  Contingency  Project  Training.    HST  for  officer  and  enlisted  personnel  includes project  skills.    Training  includes  routine  operations;  planning/design,  horizontal/vertical work, and construction management to enhance wartime project skills.  A unit must perform a minimum of one multi-trade project every 12 months for AD and 24 months for ARC.  (T-1).  Multi-trade requirements are as follows:  one each 32E3, 3E5X1, 3E6X1 and as many as possible, but at least three of the following six specialties:  3E0X1, 3E0X2, 3E1X1, 3E2X1, 3E3X1, and 3E4X1.  A typical training project scope should target 500-1000 labor hours and be complex enough to include the above AFS requirements.  To support the tracking of the required  training  project,  the  training  requirement  has  been  loaded  into  ACES  PR  (named “Contingency  Project”).    To  receive  training  credit  for  this  project  in  ACES  PR,  input  the completion date into "Contingency Project."  ACES  PR calculates STATS for Contingency Project,  which  provides  accurate  SORTS  data  for  the  progress  of  the  requirement.    UTC-tasked units not having at least on 4FPET are exempt from the contingency project training requirement.  Contracted/civil service flights are exempt from this training requirement. A2.2.  Combat  Skills.  This  training  includes  CST  such  as  unit  leadership  and  operating  in  a joint environment. A2.3.  Field Sanitation and Health Training.  This training includes personal hygiene, control of  communicable  diseases,  kitchen  and  mess  sanitation,  problems  of  extreme  climate,  field hygiene, water purification, and related topics. A2.4.  Cardiopulmonary  Resuscitation  (CPR)  Certification.  CPR  certification  typically involves  CPR  instruction  by  a  qualified  instructor  and  extensive  hands-on  training.    An American Red Cross or American Heart Association certified trainer presents CPR certification training. A2.5.  Expedient Methods. A2.5.1.  Force  Beddown.    Force  beddown  subjects  include  information  on  BEAR  assets, package  configurations,  and  playbook  options.    Lessons  cover  items  such  as  base  layout, utility systems, facility hardening, and environmental protection. A2.5.1.1.  Environmental  Management.    CE  units  play  a  lead  role  in  environmental management at home station and deployed locations.  Unit commanders/civilian leaders ensure  there  is  sufficient  environmental  management  expertise  on  standard  deployable UTCs.  At a minimum, one officer and an alternate on each 4FPET and all personnel on the  4FPAX  UTC  familiarize  themselves  with  the  Overseas  Environmental  Baseline AFI10-210  21 JANUARY 2015   31  Guidance  Document  (OEBGD)  and  AFH  10-222,  Volume  4,  Environmental  Guide  for Contingency  Operations,  and  receive  training  through  the  Air  Force  Institute  of Technology  (AFIT)  environmental  course.    They  should  pay  special  attention  to  the chapters  on  Drinking  Water,  Wastewater,  Hazardous  Material,  Hazardous  Waste,  Solid Waste,  Petroleum,  Oil  and  Lubricants,  Pesticides,  Spill  Prevention,  and  Response Planning.  Pest  Management Specialists (3E4X3) need to  be familiar with  requirements identified in the Pesticides chapter.  The OEBGD and other helpful products can be found on  the  Defense  Environmental  Network  and  Information  Exchange  web  site  at https://www.denix.osd.mil. A2.6.  Defensive  Operations.  Prime  BEEF  teams/UTCs  accomplish  hands-on  training  in defensive  operations  for  personal  and  work  party  security,  convoy  operations,  military  vehicle operator training, air base defense, defensive fighting positions, revetments, and obstacles. A2.6.1.  Defensive  operations  training  emphasizes  command,  control,  and  communications, selection and construction of defensive positions, movement to defensive positions, fire and maneuver, and reacting to attacks. A2.6.2.  Prime  BEEF  personnel  that  could  be  assigned  to  a  UTC  will  qualify  with  their primary  duty  weapon  (M-4  rifle).    (T-1).    For  each  DP/DW-coded  UTC  authorized  to  use pistols IAW Table 5.1 the unit should have a primary and one or two alternates trained and qualified.    Individuals  performing  courier,  guard,  in-flight  security,  fire  chief,  or  similar duties should also be trained on the pistol once assigned to these positions.  Note:  The UDM needs to  manually  assign these requirements in  ACES PR.  All  personnel  assigned to  EOD UTCs  will  qualify  on  both  the  M-4  and  M-9  weapons,  and  on  a  JIT  basis,  will  receive training  on  the  M-107,  M-240,  and  M-249.    (T-1).    IAW  AFI  36-2226,  Combat  Arms Program,  individuals  assigned  to  Prime  BEEF  UTCs  are  included  in  arming  Group  A  and will train to that frequency. A2.7.  Train-The-Trainer  (TTT)  Program.  To  ensure  relevant  and  effective  training,  an extensive CE TTT program  should be locally maintained.  Once completed, TTT criteria helps ensure units possess skilled cadre capable of training in all aspects of home station combat skills training.  At a minimum, all identified trainers should be a 5-skill level in their primary AFSC, have completed a local TTT course, and be a SME in the task they have been identified to train.  Those  individuals  returning  from  recent  AOR  deployments  or  those  attending  Army  PPPs possess relevant and recent experience and should be used to the maximum extent possible to not only help develop a unit training program but to provide instruction within that program.

SF Exercise Training Sites.  SF exercise training is conducted at Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) FL, Ramstein AB GE, and Andersen AFB Guam.  These sites focus on training students to perform critical contingency tasks as a team.  The training focuses on bare base beddown and sustainment operations using basic expeditionary airfield resources (BEAR) assets in a realistic environment.  Where possible, combat skills are added to the curriculum  to ensure realism and help fortify a warrior mentality throughout the training. A7.2.  ECS-TCC.  The ECS-TCC is an operating location of the 622d Civil Engineer Group and is  located  at  Dobbins  ARB  GA.    The  center  provides  certified  instructors  to  administer  and facilitate MEET, expeditionary, contingency, and upgrade training on behalf of AFRC/A7X and AFCEC/CX.  The site also provides other individual-focused specialized training to include core task certification, special purpose vehicle credentialing and licensing IAW  Table  A3.1., tractor trailer  and  mobile  hydraulic  crane  certification;  airfield  damage  repair;  MAOS  layout  and surveying  applications;  detection  equipment  training  and  active  CBRN  response  evolutions; vehicle  driver-operator  training  and  live-fire  burn  exercises;  unit  control  center  operations (command,  control,  and  communications);  EOD  incident  response  scenario  training  (classroom and practical applications) and mine-hound improvised explosive device detector training.  The Learning Resource Center affords personnel the opportunity to complete certification testing, Air Force Qualification Training Packages, and access to update resource management and training systems. A7.3.  RTS.  RTSs are a valuable asset to Prime BEEF HST since they can tailor to almost any unit’s training needs.  Each site has fully qualified/certified cadre assigned.  These sites offer a training environment free from the normal distractions associated with base activities.  The RTSs are designed to enhance SF training and proficiency upgrade training.  Training is available on HST  and  MEET  requirements  in  a  self-paced  environment.    Units  can  also  use  the  RTSs  to conduct  conferences/working groups.  These sites provide the options for rations, quarters, and equipment  for  all  types  of  training.    The  following  training  opportunities  are  available:  Emergency Airfield Lighting System, Mobile Aircraft Arresting System, Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit, Runway Paint Striper, Folded Fiberglass Mat, Field Shower Unit, High Power Generators, M-80 Boiler, Field Deployable Environmental Control Units, Airfield Marking Kit, Mobile  Emergency  Operations  Center,  Shelter  Systems,  Airfield  Damage  Repair,  Heavy Equipment Operations, and GeoBASE.  These sites are managed and operated by ANG/A7CX in partnership with local CE units. A7.4.  REOTS.  REOTS  is  located  at  the  201st  RED  HORSE  Squadron,  Fort  Indiantown  Gap PA.
