Notes: This TRAINING MODULE provides an instrument to assess the trainee’s knowledge and understanding of the definitions and processes required to perform accurate and comprehensive analysis, evaluation, and reporting of biological hazards.  Its task-step format directs the trainee to demonstrate acumen regarding categorization of biological hazards and organisms, determination of routes of entry, and the risk and impact of warfare agents.   It continues by assessing the trainee’s knowledge of informational sources and situational data and his/her ability to use this data in reviewing the factors impacting the biological health of the specific location. Knowledge of available sampling equipment is checked, while the sampling process has been stated as an optional task step. The conclusive step checks the trainee’s ability to accurately compile a findings report and enter this data into the DOEHRS.

The HHA is easy to use but, for it to be effective, it must be used correctly and under the right conditions. The HHA is not designed to be used in all circumstances. HHAs should not be used under the following conditions: •  Sampling porous surfaces. Porous surfaces contain grooves that can trap an agent thereby lowering the concentration available for testing. In addition, the grooves may contain dirt or other substances that could hinder the effectiveness of the assay.  •  Sampling in areas where a lot of dust/dirt has collected. As previously mentioned, dirt and dust may contain inhibitors that effect the reliability of the assay. •  Sampling where there is an excessive concentration of the suspected agent. This may cause clogging (hook effect) and can lead to an inconclusive result. Where excessive amounts of sample exist, diluting the sample in HHA buffer 1:10 or 1:100 should be sufficient to obtain a reliable result. •  Soil sampling. Soil may contain microorganisms that have similar antigentic properties to a biological warfare agent and could cause a false positive. Soil also contains numerous inhibitors that could adversely affect the HHA result. •  When the HHA has been removed from its protective packaging prior to initiating a test the membrane can absorb humidity (when removed from the protective package) which can lead to an inconclusive test result.  An HHA is a one-time use capability designed to presumptively identify agents. The current capability allows for presumptive identification of up to10 different biological warfare threat and 4 stimulant agents. The results can be utilized to advise and assist in facilitating the resolution of a biological incident. HHAs are NOT designed to be the sole method of identification and are not for diagnostic use.   13 AFQTP 4B051-10                                                              Journeyman Training Guide:  Biological Health Hazards   All results whether positive, negative or inconclusive should be documented. It is important to keep in mind that no matter what the outcome of an HHA, these tests provide only presumptive identification and that the samples will need further evaluation at a confirmatory lab. Ensure when using an HHA the area where the HHAs are being used is flat and clean.      14 AFQTP 4B051-10                                                              Journeyman Training Guide:  Biological Health Hazards   TASK STEPS  1.  Ensure HHA is at room temperature prior to use. 2.  Keeping the HHA panel sealed, open the bottle of buffer solution and wet the applicator. 3.  Swipe the sample area (10 cm x 10 cm square). 4.  Remove the nozzle from the buffer solution. 5.  Break off the swab tip in buffer bottle. 6.  Replace and cap nozzle. 7.  Shake for 30 seconds. 8.  Open panel on HHA. 9.  Make sure the HHA is laying on a flat surface 10.  Add 3-4 drops of buffer solution to each sample well. 11.  Wait 15 minutes (+/- 1 minute) for the HHA results to develop1. 12.  Read immediately, interpreting results2.   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:     NOTES:  1.  Sample results must be read within this time period = 15 minutes (+/- 1 minute).  2.  When reading an assay, any visible test line, even a very faint one, should be considered real. There are four potential outcomes that may be observed after running an HHA. •  The first potential outcome is two red lines indicating a positive assay. This may also be a result of matrix effects (see below) so running the sample a second time following diluting 1:10 and 1:100 in HHA buffer would be prudent.  •  The second outcome is a single line, the control line. This may be a valid negative or may be the result of the “hook effect” (see below). Again, running the sample a second time following diluting 1:10 and 1:100 in HHA buffer is advised. •  The third outcome is a positive test line but no control line. This is probably due to a faulty assay which requires running the sample again with a new set of HHA’s.  The fourth outcome is where no lines show up. This can be the result of a faulty assay, a matrix effect, or the assay may have been exposed to moisture. The nitrocellulose membrane must be dry in order to wick the sample. If an assay has an incomplete control or positive line after running, the assay is also faulty. To resolve this, a new HHA is used utilizing sample dilutions of 1:10 and 1:100 in HHA buffer.   15 AFQTP 4B051-10                                                              Journeyman Training Guide:  Biological Health Hazards   1-  Positive Result 2-  Negative result 3- Inconclusive/faulty assay    16    AFQTP 4B051-10                                                              Journeyman Training Guide:  Biological Health Hazards   TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS       STS Line Item 4.7.2.1:  Hand-Held Assays (e.g., HHA Kits)  1.

Given an XMX/2L-MIL sampling pump, perform pre-operational check and operate instrument successfully completing all checklist items with limited trainer assistance on only the hardest parts. Notes: * The XMX high volume aerosol sampling system was built in response to the need for a weatherproof, outdoor aerosol collector. The XMX is only used for collection of particulate samples, it has no detection capabilities; therefore the identification of the unknown substances must be made using another instrument or through chemical analysis. The XMX can operate with either a liquid assembly or a dry filter assembly.  Aerosolized samples can be collected directly in either a liquid-impinge containing 5 milliliters of liquid or on a 37 millimeter dry filter cassette. The unit consists of two main parts:  1) the main housing that contains the vacuum pump; blower; impinge; and the first, second, and third stage particle concentration chambers, and 2) the inlet stack, which contains the rain hood and hourglass (bubble level). Additionally, the XMX is designed to operate under field conditions, while wearing MOPP gear.  The Air Force currently uses the XMX/2L-MIL high-volume air sampler (Dycor Technologies Ltd., Edmonton Canada) for threat assessment of biological warfare agents (e.g., Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis) and naturally-occurring micro-organisms which may present health risks to personnel (e.g., adenovirus serotype-14) and negatively impact operations.   20 AFQTP 4B051-10                                                              Journeyman Training Guide:  Biological Health Hazards    TASK STEPS  SET UP FOR SAMPLING OPERATION: (The following steps are standard for setting up the XMX regardless of type of sampling operation – liquid or dry.) 1.

SWITCHING TO DRY SAMPLING OPERATION: 1.  Open the access door and twist-off the nozzle retaining nut and remove the liquid impingement nozzle. 2.  Remove the quick connect fitting from the water trap. 3.  Using a Phillips #2 screwdriver, remove the four screws from the LIM. 4.  Carefully pull the LIM down.14 5.  Install the dry impingement module (DIM) using the Phillips #2 screwdriver and the four screws. 6.  Using your hand, screw on the DIM nut and connect the quick fitting to the bottom. 7.  Unscrew the DIM nut. 8.  Take the dry filter cartridge apart; there should be two component pieces. 9.  Remove the red filter cap from the bottom half of the dry filter. 10.  Install the open face of the bottom half of the dry filter on to the DIM.15 Ensure filter is facing up. 11. Screw on the DIM nut.16 12.  If the quick connect fitting on the bottom of the DIM nut is not connected, attach it to the DIM nut. 13.  Close the DIM. 14.  Set the run-time. 15.  Turn the main power switch ON. 16.  Press and release the start button. 17.  Allow the run-time to expire. 18.  Turn the main power switch OFF. 19.  Open the DIM and remove the dry filter, following proper sample retention procedures outlined in your sampling strategy.     LOCAL REQUIREMENTS: None  NOTES: 1.  The XMX/2L-MIL requires access to a 110 VAC (or 220 VAC, depending on the model) power source. ONLY use a weatherproof power cable when connecting to 110V/220V AC. Also, do not connect or disconnect the power cable while the unit is operating. If a power source is not available, you can use the inverter to get power from a vehicle.   2.  Engage the alignment dowel in the primary nozzle plate and alignment groove in the inlet stack when installing the inlet stack. There is a black mark or notch on the primary inlet to assist you in locating the grove.   3.  There is a rain hood available for the inlet stack to protect the instrument when sampling in inclement weather.   4.  When the XMX/2L-MIL is running, the secondary flow pump draws air through the LIM allowing it to impinge an output flow-stream of particles into a liquid at a rate of 12 liters per minute. The particle-enriched flow-stream is directed through an impingement nozzle (custom pipette), into the sample vial (centrifuge tube) containing a measured volume of liquid (recommended volume is 5 milliliters). LIM associated components mounted in the LIM chamber include the water tap, the sample vial, and the impingement nozzle.   22 AFQTP 4B051-10                                                              Journeyman Training Guide:  Biological Health Hazards    5.  Using your finger, push up on the impingement nozzle while threading the nozzle retaining nut, to ensure that the impingement nozzle seats against the final (output) nozzle. Once the nozzle retaining nut is tight, carefully check that the impingement nozzle is seated correctly, by gently pulling on the impingement nozzle.   6.  CAUTION:  Since centrifuge tube dimensions by various manufacturers are not standard, it is important that the correct vial retaining nut be used. The blue vial retaining but originally shipped with the XMX/2L-MIL with the word FISHER inscribed on the side is ONLY to be used with Fisher 50 milliliter centrifuge tubes as listed in the parts list. If other centrifuge tubes are to be used, contact Dycor Technologies for the correct vial retaining nut.   7.  The XMX/2L-MIL sampler operates, as stated previously, with either a liquid impinger or dry filter assembly. During liquid sampling, particles are impinged into a sample collection vial containing a specified liquid. The sample vial size is 50 milliliters and the volume of the liquid should be 5 milliliters. Once the liquid sample is collected, the tube is removed for subsequent analysis. Dry filter paper can be used in lieu of the liquid vial impinge. During dry sampling, the particles are forced onto the dry filter instead of being impinged in a solution. The dry filter is then removed and dissolved for further analysis.     8.  If the circuit breaker is popped out, reset the breaker switch.  9.  The operation mode selector lets you select letters from A to H to set the mode of operation – H is the default mode.   10.  The three time switches allow you to set a time amount from 0 to 999 units. The time unit selector allows you to select S for seconds, M for minutes, H for hours, 0.1S for tenths of seconds, 0.1M for tenths of minutes, or 0.1H for tenths of hours.   11.  This is accomplished through a visual inspection. If the secondary pump is working properly, you should see a the sample media in the collection tube bubbling vigorously.   12.  Place your hand underneath the blower exhaust elbow to ensure air is coming out of the exhaust.   13.  It is recommended that the XMX be placed in the normal breathing zone range:  5-6 feet off the ground.   14.  Be careful not to damage the o-ring on the final nozzle.  15.  The filter will fit around the o-ring on the DIM. The fit must be tight.  16.  Make sure the DIM nut is tightly secured to ensure no vacuum leaks occur.   **If the XMX/2L-MIL is being used for laboratory or field trials, using stimulants, it is recommended the system be air-purged between trials as a precaution against cross-contamination between sampling events, by following procedures outlined in the XMX/2L-MIL USER’S GUIDE.         23 AFQTP 4B051-10                                                              Journeyman Training Guide:  Biological Health Hazards   TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS      STS Line Item 4.7.2.2:  High Volume Biological Air Samplers (e.g., XMX) 1.

Category A agents are the highest priority and include organisms that have the following characteristics: •  Easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person. 31 AFQTP 4B051-10                                                              Journeyman Training Guide:  Biological Health Hazards   •  Result in high mortality rates and have the potential for major public health impact. •  Cause public panic and social disruption. •  Require special action for public health preparedness. b. Category B: agents/diseases include brucellosis, epsilon toxin of Clostridium perfringens, food safety threats, glanders, melioidosis, Q fever, ricin toxin, staphylococcal enterotoxin B, typhus fever, viral encephalitis, and water safety threats.  Category B agents are the second highest priority and have the following characteristics: •  Moderately easy to disseminate. •  Result in moderate morbidity rates and low mortality rates. •  Require specific enhancements of CDC’s diagnostic capacity and enhanced disease surveillance. c. Category C agents include emerging infectious agents such as Nipah virus and Hantavirus, which could be engineered for mass dissemination in the future. Category C agents are the third highest priority agents and have these characteristics: •  Availability. •  Ease of production and dissemination. •  Potential for high morbidity and mortality rates and major health impact.     3.  On an installation, certain occupations have a greater chance of coming into contact with biological threats. Nurses, technicians, doctors, laboratory personnel, janitorial staff, and emergency response personnel (e.g., security forces, fire department) may come in contact with bodily fluids, exposing them to blood borne pathogens. Blood borne pathogens are microorganisms present in human blood that can cause disease. Other susceptible occupations include wastewater treatment plant operators and plumbers that are exposed to water potentially contaminated with fecal matter and other bodily fluids, thus exposing them to biological threats. Existing OEH data is a good place to start gathering your initial information on workplace processes and potential biological threats.  4. Potential samples (powders, liquids) can be screened at a site with detection equipment and collected for laboratory analysis. Sampling should be coordinated with the base laboratory and potentially the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) for positive identification. The Center for Disease Control states, “The LRN is a national security asset, that with its partners, will develop, maintain, and strengthen an integrated domestic and international network of laboratories to respond quickly to biological, chemical, and radiological threats and other high priority public health emergencies need through training, rapid testing, timely notification and secure messaging of laboratory results.”  5.
