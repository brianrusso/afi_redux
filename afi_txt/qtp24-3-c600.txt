The manufacturer’s operator’s manual, applicable deicing operation  TOs  and  local  guidance  will  also  provide  safe  deicer  operating  procedures.  Additionally,  the  vehicle  itself  may  have  warning,  cautions,  and  danger  stickers  that  the Vehicle Operator should be aware of.  5.5.1.1.  General safety and precautions.  5.5.1.1.1.   Operator and passengers shall wear seat belts as provided.      5.5.1.1.2.   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment. 5.5.1.1.3.   Obstacles and hazards.   Check the work area for obstacles that can cause loss of control to the vehicle:  holes, objects, slippery surfaces, rough spots, etc.  Plan the approach of the vehicle to and from the aircraft to avoid these hazards. 5.5.1.1.4.   Overhead clearance.  Stay clear of electrical power lines. 5.5.1.1.5.   Do not stand on guard rails. 5.5.1.1.6.   Do not operate the deicer without gates closed and latched.  5.5.1.2.  Foreign Object Damage (FOD).  5.5.1.2.1.   Vehicle  operators  will  remove  FOD  from  tires  during  daily  the  vehicle inspection.  Before entering the airfield, a physical check for loose/unsecured objects and an inspection of the tire treads for FOD will be accomplished, with the exception of emergency vehicles responding to actual situations.  5.5.1.2.2.   Any vehicle which has been driven on an unpaved surface will have a tire FOD inspection accomplished prior to re-entering the airfield area.  5.5.1.3.  Deicing fluids.   5.5.1.3.1.   Most anti-icing, deicing and defrosting fluids are mildly toxic.  Contact with the skin or eyes should be avoided.  Avoid prolonged exposure.  5.5.1.3.2.   Be aware of the flash temperature of the fluid.  Take care to insure that the fluids are kept away from sparks, fire and oxidizing agents.  5.5.1.3.3.   Wear adequate eye protection when applying deicing fluids.  5.5.1.3.4.   Deicing fluids containing ethylene glycol (MIL-A-8243, Type II) have been found to cause severe spalling of Portland cement concrete pavements. This damage may be prevented or minimized by treating such pavements prior to exposure with light seal coats of emulsified linseed oil.  5.5.1.3.5.   The presence of either  deicing or anti-icing fluids around  Liquid Oxygen (LOX) servicing/overflow areas can result in a potential fire.  Prior to LOX servicing, the fluids shall be removed from areas adjacent to the LOX filler and overflow tubes by flushing or wiping methods.  5.5.1.3.6.   Special care shall be exercised to  prevent  the excess  use of fluids around cabin heater and/or ventilator air intake ducts or around the intakes of the engines and APU’s.  This precaution is essential to minimize the possibility of toxic fumes entering the cabin or cockpit during taxi prior to takeoff.  On some aircraft, the engine bleed could be closed for a short period for dryout, before takeoff must be approved by the respective Aircraft Single Manager (AF) or PMA (United States Navy).  5.5.1.3.7.   Extreme  caution  must  be  exercised  in  the  use  of  glycol-water  solutions (including MIL-A-8243, SAE AMS 1424, Type I, and SAE AMS 1428, Type II,/IV Fluids)  in  and  around  aircraft  having  silver  or  silver-coated  electrical/electronic circuitry.    Rapid  oxidation  and  fire  can  occur  when  glycol-water  solutions  come  in contact  with  and  short  across  bare  or  defectively  insulated  silver  or  silver-coated electrical  circuits  such  as  wiring,  switches,  circuit  breakers,  etc.,  which  are  carrying Direct Current (DC).  5.5.1.4.  Deicing operations safety overview.    5.5.1.4.1.   Use spotters/marshalars when approaching the aircraft, backing, etc.  Note:  A spotter(s)/marshalar(s) is required within 25 feet of the aircraft.  A spotter/marshalar should be positioned in a safe area and trained IAW AFMAN 24-306. 5.5.1.4.2.   Wing walkers are required at each wing tip when taxiing aircraft from an obstructed area or when the obstruction is within 25 feet of the aircraft. 5.5.1.4.3.   When  deicing  any  portion  of  an  aircraft  by  spray  method,  all  other maintenance operations to the aircraft shall be suspended.  All but deicing personnel shall vacate aircraft vicinity during the deicing process.            5.5.1.4.4.   Remove ice from leading edge first and then move progressively aft.  Spray fluid from front to back on all wing/tail surfaces. 5.5.1.4.5.   Do not use fluid for the removal of heavy snow. 5.5.1.4.6.   Operate the spray boom slowly and cautiously. 5.5.1.4.7.   Use covers when possible. 5.5.1.4.8.   Take  care to prevent  ice/snow containments  on  the aircraft surfaces from entering or accumulating in intakes or control surface hinge areas. 5.5.1.4.9.   Remove any accumulation of ice, slush or snow from the wing trailing-edge flap areas.  Damage can occur if flaps are raised prior to this area being checked and cleaned as required. 5.5.1.4.10.  During heavy or extended participation, check for accumulation in cavities, such as slots, balance bays, or wing and stabilizer rear spar areas. 5.5.1.4.11.  Under  freezing  fog  or  other  similar  precipitation  conditions,  it  may  be necessary for the front and rear side of engine fan blades to be checked for ice buildup prior to starting the engine.  Any deposits found shall be removed as recommended by the USAF Aircraft Single Manager.  5.6. Deicer Vehicle Operation.  5.6.1.  Start-up procedures.  5.6.1.1.  Make sure automatic transmission is in neutral and emergency/parking brake is set.  5.6.1.2.  Use ignition switch to start the truck engine.  Allow engine to warm-up.  5.6.1.3.
