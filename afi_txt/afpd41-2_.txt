SUMMARY OF CHANGES This Publication has been rewritten in its entirety.  1.  Background.  Medical Support is necessary to sustain Air Force (AF) medical care around the  world  to  maintain  a  fit  and  vital  force,  save  life  and  limb,  prevent  undue  suffering,  and preserve military strength during contingencies.  By efficiently applying medical support, the AF can  offer  medical  care  at  a  reasonable  cost  while  improving  quality  and  access.  As  much  as   2  AFPD41-2   28 June 2013 possible, the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) must also care for authorized beneficiaries who are not on active duty. 2.  Policy.  The Air Force shall: 2.1.  Develop  procedures  for  inpatient  and  outpatient  services  including  establishing  and maintaining an accurate, well-documented health record for every patient. 2.2.  Establish  processes  for  medical  planning,  programming,  budgeting  and  execution (PPBE) to responsibly allocate medical resources and manpower. 2.3.  Develop information systems that help healthcare managers obtain information needed to manage medical operations. 2.4.  Ensure military medical units are ready to respond to contingencies. 2.5.  Provide responsive, economical, and efficient medical logistics support, which includes the availability of peacetime and war reserve materiel (WRM). 2.6.  Provide technology and management to make sure the physical facility operates safely and efficiently in delivering quality health care. 2.7.  Efficiently  use  resources  to  deliver  healthcare  that  meets  or  exceeds  federal  or  state requirements. 2.8.  Establish, monitor and report internal controls to measure AFMS compliance. 3.  Responsibilities. 3.1.  The  Surgeon  General  of  the  Air  Force  (AF/SG)  develops,  coordinates,  and  executes medical policy and essential procedural guidance to manage the Air Force Medical Service.  AF/SG also ensures AFMS’s readiness, evaluates resource use and policy, and offers the Air Force’s medical views on policies or legislation to the Department of Defense. 3.2.  Major  Command  (MAJCOM)  and  ANG  interpret  and  enforce  this  policy,  guide commanders of the medical treatment facilities (MTF) in carrying it out, collect and report data to higher headquarters and develop and maintain standards for medical readiness within their respective components.
