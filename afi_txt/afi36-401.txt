Education level is determined from “an employee’s educational attainment from anaccredited institution”, according to guidance from the Office of Personnel Management (Guide toPersonnel Data Standards). In addition, guidance from the Office of Personnel Management estab-lishes that only accredited education gained by employees is credited in employee records (Qualifica-tion Handbook). Degrees awarded by Air University upon completion of in-residence Air Commandand Staff College and Air War College will be coded in employee records as education. 1.9.2.  Training. The following guidance is provided for consistency in crediting training: 1.9.2.1.  General Information. Training is not strictly limited to specific courses, types of trainingor methods of completion. Good judgment must be used in all cases to meet the changing needs ofpersonnel programs and employee development goals. Coordination between Employee Develop-ment and Staffing functional experts is essential to credit training. A training course completioncertificate or appropriate documentation must include the student’s name, course name, totalcourse hours, and course start and completion dates. Regardless of funding source, training paidfor by the government must be credited in employee records. 1.9.2.2.  Continuing Education Unit (CEU). Many colleges, universities, and professional organi-zations sponsor a variety of professional development courses that award Continuing EducationUnits (CEUs) instead of semester or quarter hour credits. These courses are typically short-term innature and may not be a part of an undergraduate-or graduate-level curriculum. When professionaldevelopment courses are not creditable for undergraduate-or graduate-level credits, CEUs shouldbe coded as training. If the course provider indicates the number of hours of actual class instruc-tion, code that amount. If not provided, the Air Force will apply the "Louis Phillips' ContinuingEducation Guide " for consistency. Code CEUs at the rate of 10 hours for each CEU. For example,an employee awarded three CEU credits should be coded with 30 hours of training. In some cases,an employee will request that the course be reflected in the personnel history as college credit. Inorder for that to occur, the employee must have his or her college or university convert the CEUsto semester or quarter hours on a transcript. 1.9.2.3.  Mandatory Training. All training completions required by law, the Office of PersonnelManagement, the Department of Defense, or Air Force policy will be credited in employeerecords. 1.9.2.4.  Other Training. Other non-mandatory training may be credited in employee records. 1.9.3.  Self-Development Courses Applicable to Employee’s Current Position or Career Progression.This includes, but is not limited to, such courses as professional military education (PME) which arevaluable for Air Force career progression. Other self-development activities may also qualify forcredit for similar reasons. Coordination between Employee Development and Staffing functionalexperts is essential when crediting self-development courses in employee records. 1.10.  Managers and Supervisors. Managers and supervisors have the following responsibility: AFI36-401   28 JUNE 2002111.10.1.  Use performance appraisals for determining training needs for their assigned employees. Indi-vidual Development Plans (IDPs) are used as an additional source as appropriate. 1.10.2.  Review technology shifts. Anticipate and identify actual mission, program, weapon, or systemchanges. Review career program master development plans and Career Enhancement Plans (CEPs) todetermine training and developmental needs (further information regarding career plans can be foundon the Air Force Personnel Center web site, http://www.afpc.randolph.af.mil/cp). Review the DAUcatelog to determine acquisition training required by DAWIA for the acquisition workforce. Prioritizeneeds and the methods used in evaluating training (See Attachment 4). Develop impact statements iftraining is not funded (See Attachment 5). 1.10.3.  Consult with the EDM/S on identifying needs and the most economical and efficient sourcesof training. 1.10.4.  Ensure affirmative employment initiatives are considered in identifying training and develop-ment needs. 1.10.5.  Evaluate subordinates' job performance following formal training, on-the-job training (OJT),and developmental assignments for effectiveness, and provide written evaluations to the EDM/S asrequired. 1.10.6.  Prepare required documentation on the DD Form 1556, Request, Authorization, Agreement,Certification of Training and Reimbursement, or through electronic means approved by HQ USAF/DPDE when requesting training. Approve DAU training requests that an employee submits via elec-tronic means, ACQ Now. 1.10.7.  Ensure employees are released to attend training as scheduled. 1.10.8.  Set-up and implement formal training requirements for such programs as worker-trainee,apprenticeship, DOP, and intern programs. 1.10.9.  Follow merit procedures in selecting employees for training or developmental assignmentsthat may serve to enhance promotional opportunities. 1.10.10.  Mentor and inform subordinates on self-development opportunities. Encourage career devel-opment activities. For further information on mentoring see AFI 36-3401. 1.10.11.  Coordinate with the base civilian training program office, the CPF, and the installation safetyoffice when procuring training activities with physical requirements which may adversely affect thesafety and health of federal employees. 1.11.  Employees. Employees will do the following: 1.11.1.  Maintain the necessary competence to do the job and help the organization meet its mission. 1.11.2.

Waivers for Competitive Sourcing and/or Privatization.  When organizations are undergoingstudies for competitive sourcing and/or privatizing of civilian education and training functions, it is notnecessary to obtain waivers for responsibilities stipulated within this instruction which make specific ref-erence to training/education of civilian personnel. It is understood that the contractor will assume respon-sibilities for civilian education and training in accordance with this instruction and the statement of work.All waiver for competitive sourcing and/or privatization studies granted to the 1 August 1994 edition ofthis publication remain in effect. All follow-on statements of work will be developed IAW this instruc-tion. AFI36-401   28 JUNE 200213Chapter 2  IMPLEMENTING AND CONTROLLING PROGRAMS AND FUNDING LEVELS 2.1.  Applying the Installation Training Guide (ITG). This guide contains specific guidance with localtraining program operations. For information on developing an ITG see Attachment 12. 2.1.1.  Identification of Training Needs.  Annually, supervisors and managers identify employee train-ing requirements and assign priorities. (See Attachment 4.) 2.1.2.  Documentation. The supervisor documents identified training requirements using the proce-dures developed and provided by the civilian training function. (see Attachment 4.) 2.1.3.  Training Source Determination. Management, with the assistance from the EDM/S, will deter-mine the best training source needed to satisfy the training requirement. (See Attachment 9.) 2.1.4.  Validation. Key management officials document and validate all training needs to ensure therequirements and priorities support mission needs. Validated training requirements are submitted tothe EDM/S who: 2.1.4.1.  Reviews documents for legal and regulatory compliance. 2.1.4.2.  Ensures the effectiveness of the training source and method for meeting identified needs. 2.1.4.3.  Monitors duplication of organizational training requirements for possible grouping andcost effectiveness and efficiency. 2.1.4.4.  Oversees applicability of the Office of Management and Budget Circular, A-76, Perfor-mance of Commercial Activities. 2.1.5.  Recording Training Needs. The supervisor records all training requirements in the employeework folder. Supervisors should ensure that training requirements are linked to the mission of the AirForce. The EDM/S can provide guidance and instructions on developing the Individual DevelopmentPlan (IDP), if required. Source documents (i.e., DD Forms 1556, course descriptions, approval ratio-nale, evaluations, AFMAN 36-606, etc.) are maintained on file by the EDM/S. 2.2.  Preparation and Use of The Annual Installation Training Plan (AITP).  The EDM/S identifiesthe projected fiscal year training requirements for use by the CECMC or MTC to accomplish the finalinstallation-wide validation of the AITP. Committee action ensures that: 2.2.1.  Requirements represent training needs as indicated by past training activities and anticipatedfuture needs. 2.2.2.  Priority groupings are proper and any unmet needs resulting from funding restrictions are ana-lyzed. 2.2.3.  Impact statements are prepared and submitted to the EDM/S for any unmet training needs. 2.2.4.  Projected training cost estimates are reasonable and sufficient to accommodate predictedexpenses. 2.2.5.  Additions, deletions, and adjustments to training requirements and estimated costs reflect opti-mum use of resources. 14AFI36-401   28 JUNE 20022.2.6.  After the committee validation process is complete, the AITP is sent to the approving official atthe appropriate level. 2.3.  Budget and Financial Resource Management.  The EDM/S manages and administers fundsrequired to meet training needs (see Attachment 5). These responsibilities also include the managementof the Government Purchase Card (GPC) used as a method of payment for training and education (seeChapter 10). To accomplish this, the EDM/S will: 2.3.1.  Ensure no appropriated funds are used to support the training of Non-Appropriated Fund(NAF) personnel when the training is required for the performance of the employees’ NAF duties(i.e., education and training to advance job knowledge, develop skills, and improve abilities of NAFemployees). The exception to this requirement is the education and training of child care providers,which is authorized from appropriated funds by the Military Child Care Act of 1989. Additionally,appropriated funds are authorized for training all employees for command or base required training(EEO, fire safety, HIV awareness, etc.). Appropriated funds may be authorized for training of NAFemployees performing the duties of an authorized appropriated fund position as long as this training isnot also required for the performance of the employees’ NAF duties. For further guidance on the useof appropriated funds to support the training of NAF personnel see AFI 65-106. 2.3.2.  Ensure funds will not be used to support the direct attainment of licenses or certifications. Anemployee is not prohibited from attending a training course and receiving a license or certification asan incidental by-product of the training. 2.3.3.  Determine and assign proper budget categories [appropriations, program element code (PEC),RC/CC, element of expense and investment codes (EEIC), etc.] for obligating, expending, and track-ing training expenses, to include coding of such in an automated data system. 2.3.4.  Coordinate with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), organizational units,and other applicable finance offices on financial matters involving distribution, adjustments, andexpenditures of funds; and contracting offices on contract training, i.e., AF Form 9, Request for Pur-chase. When using an AF Form 9, the DFAS officer designee certifies the availability of funds. Whenthe GPC is the method of payment, use appropriate form(s) i.e., AF Form 4009, Government PurchaseCard Fund Cite Authorization, to commit funds against the correct PEC and EEIC. For further guid-ance on training and education program manager responsibilities for the GPC, see Chapter 10. 2.3.5.  Implement internal procedures to monitor training fund expenditures, regardless of fundingsource, to include purchases through the GPC, contracting offices on AF Form 9, and with temporaryduty orders. 2.3.6.  Control obligations to remain within the projected quarterly/annual level of authority. 2.3.7.  Coordinate on availability of funds. 2.3.8.  Validate fund citations. 2.3.9.  Monitor the quarterly/annual financial portion of the AITP by reconciling accounting reports,corresponding data products, DD Forms 1556, Request, Authorization, Agreement, Certification ofTraining and Reimbursement, monthly reconciliation of the credit card report, and the accounting andfinance system, etc. AFI36-401   28 JUNE 200215Chapter 3  EVALUATING TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT 3.1.  Training Purpose.  The evaluation process completes the training and development cycle. It pro-vides supervisors, employees, and the EDM/S with information to determine how well a specific trainingcourse or program has met its objectives. This determination is essential in justifying the expenditure oftraining funds to improve work quality, quantity, timeliness, productivity or management operations. 3.2.  Evaluating Completed Training and Development:  3.2.1.  Employees, supervisors, managers, and EDM/Ss evaluate training continually. As a minimum,a formal evaluation is completed annually. The ITG includes an outline of how to complete the formalevaluation. The annual evaluation may be completed and documented as part of the AITP review andmust include a variety of evaluation techniques (see Attachment 4). 3.2.2.  The EDM/S provides assistance to supervisors and employees in the evaluation process. 3.2.3.  The EDM/S makes use of individual course evaluations as a technique in the evaluation pro-cess and takes positive action in response to all course evaluations which are rated less than satisfac-tory. Written documentation of the action taken is maintained for future reference and planningpurposes with the annual evaluation of training. 3.2.4.  Overall program evaluation and required EDM/S follow-up actions are review items for AirForce headquarters and MAJCOM evaluation teams. 3.3.  Evaluating Training Program Administration.  As a minimum, the EDM/S is responsible forevaluating program requirements. 16AFI36-401   28 JUNE 2002Chapter 4  PROGRAM AND SPECIAL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS 4.1.  Continued Service Agreements (CSA).  4.1.1.  A CSA includes an agreement by the employee to continue in service upon training comple-tion. As a minimum, all training over 80 hours requires a CSA. The period of service obligationbegins the first workday after the training ends, and is equal to at least three times the length of thetraining. Longer periods of required service are set if justified by the costs of training or other factors,such as situations when employee enters into a period of non-pay status. The EDM/S evaluates eachinstance of training to justify an agency's substantial investment of resources. When some or all of theadditional training expenses are paid, but the employee receives no pay, (i.e. training occurs after dutyhours) the period of service is equal to the length of the training, with a minimum one-month obliga-tion. 4.1.2.  Computed costs of training for reimbursement purposes should include tuition, travel, perdiem, books and materials, fees, other related costs, and administrative overhead costs (such as thecosts for planning, conducting, and administering the training; advertising the training; conductingemployee screening and selection processes; monitoring completion; evaluating effectiveness of thetraining; etc.) as appropriate. The trainee’s salary will not be included. 4.1.3.  Employees sign a CSA before commencement of training. (See Attachment 11.) Once anemployee has signed a CSA, the EDM/S ensures a system is in place to monitor the date the obligationservice commitment expires, preventing any separation personnel action from being processed with-out consideration of this obligation. 4.1.4.  An employees who fails to complete training covered by a CSA is still obligated for costsincurred. The CSA stays in effect to protect government interests even though the employee with-draws from, or otherwise fails to complete, training. It should be adjusted to reflect actual costsincurred. 4.1.5.  For CCDP (see Chapter 8), service commitments are as follows, unless otherwise specified fora particular course: Short-term Executive Development: 1 year; Long-term programs less than$40,000: 3 years; Long-term programs $40,000 to $59,999: 4 years; and Long-term programs $60,000or more: 5 years. 4.1.6.  Recovery of expenses for failure to complete CSA is prorated against the remaining portion ofthe employee’s obligated service commitment. For example, if the cost of training is $3,000 and theemployee has completed two-thirds of the obligated service, the employee will reimburse the AirForce $1,000 instead of the original $3,000. 4.2.  Waiver of CSA.  4.2.1.  Employees are required to provide at least a 10 work-day advance notice to their servicing CPFof their intent to transfer to another agency or resign while under the obligation period. 4.2.2.  Authority to waive CSA obligations is established at MAJCOM, AFPC/DPK, AFATO, or bythe EDM/S depending on the training involved. A waiver is granted in whole or in part based onemployee justification. Approval of any waiver is fully documented and based on full consideration ofAFI36-401   28 JUNE 200217equity, good conscience, and the public interest in the decision process. Requests for waiver are pro-cessed through the servicing civilian training office and command training functions for review andrecommendation prior to forwarding to the approval authority. 4.2.3.  A waiver may be granted if the employee has completed most, but not all, of the requiredperiod of service; resigned because of personal illness or serious illness of a member of his or herimmediate family; or is unable to make the required payment because of severe financial hardship. 4.2.4.  Employees are not required to repay funds when moving to another government agency posi-tion within the Department of Defense. The remaining period of obligated service, however, is trans-ferred to the gaining DoD Component. 4.2.5.  Air Force employees may process grievances on decisions not to grant waivers through the AirForce grievance system described in AFI 36-1203. Bargaining unit employees who are covered by acollective bargaining agreement resolve disagreements through negotiated procedures. 4.3.  Attendance at Meetings.  Employees can take part in activities and meetings of non-governmentassociations, to include technical, scientific, and professional societies. Funding and approval authoritiesdiffer depending on the purpose of the meeting. When the purpose for attendance clearly meets a trainingobjective, as determined by the EDM/S, the use of training funds is appropriate. When the purpose forattendance is not primarily for training, base support funds will be used. 18AFI36-401   28 JUNE 2002Chapter 5  TRAINING SOURCES 5.1.  Use of Interagency Training Programs and Facilities.  Interagency training refers to training pro-grams and facilities that are set up for the use of more than one agency. When courses require a sin-gle-agency point of contact, such as the Federal Executive Institute, Management Development Center,etc., AFSLMO/DP and HQ AFPC/DPK, respectively, centrally fund attendance. For acquisition trainingprovided by DAU under DAWIA, AFATO centrally manages the funds. Other interagency courses arenormally developed, administered, and funded at the installation level. 5.2.  Use of Non-Government Training Facilities.  When Federal government facilities cannot meet atraining need, the EDM/S may arrange training through the local contracting office or non-governmentfacilities. There are constraints and prohibitions on use of non-government training facilities. Theseinclude training: 5.2.1.  Which teaches or advocates the overthrow of the United States government by force or vio-lence. This prohibition also applies to training provided by a person about whom a proper determina-tion has been made that there is reasonable doubt concerning his or her loyalty to the United States. 5.2.2.  Which carries on subversive propaganda, attempting to influence legislation, or participating orinterfering in political campaigns on behalf of any candidate for public office. 5.2.3.  Which illegally discriminates in the admission or in subsequent treatment of students. 5.3.  Establishing Local Training Courses and Programs.   Local  training  programs,  includingon-the-job-training, should be used to fill identified training needs whenever this approach has been vali-dated as the most efficient and economical method of training. The Instructional Systems Development(ISD) process is used when developing a local training course or program to ensure that they arejob-related and cost effective. See AFI 36-2201 for additional information. 5.4.  On-The-Job-Training (OJT).  Methods used to satisfy a training requirement should be efficientand economical. OJT should not only be considered for the employees within a particular work unit, butshould also be considered for any displaced employees affected by downsizing, reassignment, or base clo-sure. OJT is planned, organized, and conducted at the work site. For further guidance concerning on thejob training, see Attachment 9. 5.5.  Air Force Mentoring.  The goal of mentoring is to help each person reach his/her full potential,thereby enhancing the overall professionalism of the Air Force. A mentor is defined as “a trusted counse-lor or guide”. Various levels of Leadership--officers, enlisted and civilians-- play a vital role in the men-toring program through an ongoing processing of fostering principles, traditions, shared values and thelessons of our profession. Supervisors are key to the professional development of their personnel by pro-viding training and guidance through mentoring. (For further guidance on the Air Force Mentoring Pro-gram refer to AFI 36-3401, Air Force Mentoring). 5.6.  Suggested Reading List : A list of suggested reading material has been devised by the Air ForceHistorian for the Chief of Staff to promote professional and self-development of Air Force people byenhancing the knowledge of the civilian work force on the history of air and space power. Designed forAFI36-401   28 JUNE 200219civilians and divided into grade range categories, the reading list was created to mirror the reading list ofofficers and enlisted. A complete reading list for all grades is available on the Air Force web site, “AirForce Link”, under “library”. The books are also available for commercial purchase or through the baselibrary. The suggested reading list is a part of the Air Force Chief of Staff Reading Program. 5.7.  Continuous Learning (CL) for Acquisition Professionals. Civilian and military acquisition pro-fessionals are expected to participate in continuous learning activities throughout their acquisition careers.Continuous learning activities augment the education, training, and experience standards established forAPDP certification purposes. Opportunities for professional development, education and training shall bemade available as appropriate. The OSD CL policy, Air Force CL Implementation Policy, suggestedsources for CL training, and additional information can be found at the Acquisition Career Managementhomepage: http://www.safaq.hq.af.mil/acq_workf/career_training/cl.html. 20AFI36-401   28 JUNE 2002Chapter 6  FORMS, REPORTS, AND RECORDS DISPOSITION 6.1.  Forms Used in Training and Development.  The Air Force civilian training program uses a widevariety of forms in processing, validating, planning, financing, and accomplishing employee develop-ment. See Table A3.1. in Attachment 3 for the use of each form prescribed in this instruction. 6.2.  Formal Training Plans (FTP).  Supervisors prepare the FTP within the first 30 days of the assign-ment for employees participating in formal training programs, i.e. Developmental Opportunity Program(DOP), intern programs, etc. The EDM/S maintains the approved training plan. Copies are provided to thesupervisor and employee. Supervisors will use the FTP for periodic employee counseling in conjunctionwith the annual performance appraisal. Each FTP will include: 6.2.1.  Knowledge, Skill, and Ability (KSAs) required 6.2.2.  Expected level of proficiency for each KSA and how that proficiency is to be measured 6.2.3.  Specific methods and sources of training and development for each KSA to be acquired includ-ing the hours required for each developmental activity 6.2.4.  Anticipated completion date for each training and development activity 6.2.5.  Signature by supervisor and employee 6.3.  Individual Development Plan (IDP).  An IDP is a written plan outlining the training and progressof an employee new to an organization work-site or for which the documentation of an employee’s train-ing and progress is desired. They also serve as an important mentoring tool used for outlining desiredcareer path progression. IDPs are for employees not covered by a formal training program for which a for-mal training plan would be required. The IDP is tailored to individual employee needs and is based on theemployee’s job description. The EDM/S can provide guidance and instruction on developing the IDP.IDPs are required for the acquisition workforce throughout their careers. 6.4.  Records Disposition.  The EDM/S will maintain and dispose of all training documentation createdby this instruction according to AFMAN 37-139 and AFI 36-114. Training documents and materialsshould be retained in the training files. Continued Service Agreements (CSA) should be retained in accor-dance with OM 293-31 as temporary documents in the Official Personnel Folder (OPF) until the agree-ment has been satisfied. AFI36-401   28 JUNE 200221Chapter 7  DEFENSE LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (DLAMP) 7.1.

Purpose: To provide Air Force guidance on the use of the government purchase card to pay foreducation and training regardless of funding source. For additional guidance see AFI 64-117. 10.2.  Program Description:  10.2.1.  The government purchase card will be used as the payment method for non-government and/or government off-the-shelf training and education up to $25,000 for an individual event or plannedseries of the same training event, activity, service, or course material regardless of funding source. 10.2.2.  Off-the-shelf training is defined as training products and services regularly available to thegeneral public and/or government personnel. The term includes training offered in catalogs or otherprinted material by a college, university, professional association, consultant firm or organization. Itdoes not include training specifically developed, designed, or produced to meet a requirement uniqueto an organization and/or program. AF Form 9, Request for Purchase, not the government purchasecard, is the proper document to purchase training designed specifically to meet a requirement uniqueto an organization. The government purchase card does not take the place of formal acquisition proce-dures. 10.3.  Responsibilities:  10.3.1.  Issues related to the use of the card that cannot be resolved at the local level should be ele-vated through the appropriate chain of command to HQ USAF/DPDE. Training and education pro-gram managers are responsible for: 10.3.1.1.  Complying with appropriate purchase card directives. 10.3.1.2.  Monitoring the execution of applicable program element codes (PECs). 10.3.1.3.  Implementing internal procedures to track the execution of training funds using the gov-ernment purchase card. 10.3.1.4.  Reviewing and approving requests for training according to statutory and administrativerequirements, regardless of funding source. Training and education purchased through other fund-ing sources, using a DD Form 1556, Request, Authorization, Agreement, Certification of Trainingand Reimbursement, will comply with these procedures. 10.3.1.5.  Documenting all purchases and complying with the requirements in United States AirForce Internal Procedures for Using the GPC (formerly IMPAC), 26 Apr 97. 10.3.1.6.  Reconciling the monthly billing statement and obligations against the credit card reportand the accounting and finance system. 10.3.1.7.  Ensuring that funds are obligated to cover outstanding charges, particularly those fromprior year. 10.3.1.8.  Using appropriate form(s), i.e., AF Form 4009, to commit funds against the correct PECand element of expense investment code (EEIC). If entered correctly, DFAS reports should iden-AFI36-401   28 JUNE 200233tify the obligation of funds against PECs (i.e., PEC 88751, PEC 84753, etc., and EEIC 553). Eachpurchase card has only one line of accounting associated with it. Card holders using acquisition(PEC 84753) and non-acquisition (PEC 88751) funds must have a separate card for each PEC. Toaccurately account for funds at locations with multiple command IDs, training and education pro-gram managers will be given the option of doing journal vouchers or having a separate card foreach RC/CC within the Operating Budget Account Number (OBAN). Training and education pro-gram managers will work with their local Financial Services Office (FSO) to establish the mostappropriate procedure. 10.3.1.9.  Advising vendors who are reluctant to accept the card due to the interchange rate (cardfee) that they are eligible for the VISA “big ticket” interchange rate. These vendors should requesttheir bank or financial institution provide them with the “big ticket” interchange rate. By havingthis rate, the “fee” they have to pay on credit card transactions can be as low as 1%. Questionsshould be directed to the Agency/Organization Program Coordinator (A/OPC). 10.3.1.10.  Prepaying training expenses according to common commercial practice. Training andeducation program managers can only dispute charges within a 30-day period from date of pay-ment. After 30 days, program managers must resolve disputes with the vendor. The window ofopportunity for prepayment of training is 60 days prior to the course start date. 10.3.1.11.  Working with servicing contracting office to ensure appropriate procedures are usedwhen training is specifically designed, developed, or produced to meet a requirement unique to anorganization. 10.3.2.  The A/OPC will issue cards, provide information and guidance on the use of the card, andtrain card holders. A/OPC will establish cardholder accounts as requested by training and educationprogram managers with a single purchase limit of $25,000. All merchant category codes (MCCs) willbe blocked except the following sources of training:  1. 8220 - Colleges, universities, junior colleges, and professional schools 2. 8241 - Correspondence schools 3. 8244 - All business/secondary schools 4. 8249 - Vocational/trade schools 5. 8299 - Default 6. 7392 - Management, Consulting, and Public Relations Services 7. 7399 - Business Services (Not classified elsewhere) 8. 8211 - Elementary and Secondary Schools 9. 8699 - Membership Organization (Not classified elsewhere) 10. 9399 - Government Services (Not classified elsewhere)10.4.

Are you significantly changing programs or projected staffing level (e.g. major reorganiza-tions)? A4.2.3.  Are you considering any military-to-civilian conversions? A4.2.4.  Have your inspection, evaluation, or audit reports highlighted conditions indicating the needfor training? A4.2.5.  Are you contemplating contracting-out initiatives? A4.2.6.  Have you experienced Reductions-in-Force (RIF) within your work site, or do you anticipatesuch actions in the future? A4.2.7.  Are you considering affirmative action goals when identifying training? A4.2.8.  Is training required for APDP certification at the appropriate level for the position? A4.2.9.  Have you considered how automation will change the occupation or skill mix of your work-site? A4.2.10.  Are you experiencing significant changes in the state-of-the-art for certain scientific andengineering disciplines? A4.2.11.  Are you experiencing critical recruitment and retention problems? A4.2.12.  Have you reviewed regulations and are data system inquiries completed to ensure directedtraining is planned and coordinated (e.g. labor contract negotiations and drug and alcohol abuse)? A4.3.  Specific Indicators.  A4.3.1.  Have you reviewed what types and how many previously identified valid training needs werenot met? Does the need still exist? (Use last fiscal year's AITP.) 48AFI36-401   28 JUNE 2002A4.3.2.  Have you identified individual employee performance problems that were not caused by atti-tudinal or motivational factors? A4.3.3.  Do you recognize and understand formal training and development activities required bycareer management programs? A4.3.4.  Have you reviewed staffing plans, program documents, unit manning documents, and mis-sion requirements to identify training needs? A4.3.5.  Have you screened career enhancement plans to identify formal training requirements? A4.3.6.  Does the training fall under DAWIA, and are specific DAU courses required? A4.3.7.  Have you identified specific training needs in IDPs, as appropriate? A4.3.8.  Have you identified positions for Developmental Opportunity Program (DOP) participants? A4.3.9.  Have you considered establishing intern positions for intake of new personnel? A4.3.10.  Have you gained new personnel through Reduction In Force (RIF)? A4.3.11.  Do you anticipate implementing the Student Educational Employment Program (SEEP)? A4.3.12.  Have you considered using Worker-Trainee Program (WTP) when setting up your posi-tions? A4.3.13.  Are you aware of, or contemplating using Veterans' Readjustment Act placements? A4.4.  Selecting the Method of Training. The decision to select a formal training course or developmen-tal experience requires careful consideration. Positive responses to any one or all of the following ques-tions may indicate that formal training is not needed: A4.4.1.  Will a change in the method of doing the work result in the desired objective? A4.4.2.  Can a review of the work tasks for performance compliance eliminate the need for training? A4.4.3.  Would improved communications solve the performance problem? A4.4.4.  Can OJT satisfy the need? A4.4.5.  Could self-development provide the KSAs needed to improve performance, and has theemployee been encouraged to participate? A4.4.6.  Would a detail or informal developmental experience, rather than formal training, satisfy thetraining need? A4.4.7.  Will formal training be directly transferable to the work situation? A4.5.  Part 2--Prioritizing Training Needs. Once training needs have been properly determined theyneed to be assigned a priority or rank. Determination of training priorities is a critical judgment processaccomplished by managers and supervisors. A4.5.1.  Variables and Needs. The process should involve comparison of the predominant variableslisted below to the training need that has been identified: AFI36-401   28 JUNE 200249A4.5.1.1.  Timing. When must the training be accomplished? Is the timing critical to successfulaccomplishment of work functions, tasks, responsibilities, and ultimately, mission activities?Would delays be adverse to effective work completion? A4.5.1.2.  Cost and Benefit Ratio. In terms of money and time expenditures, are the results oftraining expected to outweigh those costs? Can the benefits be readily quantified and tied to validmethods for measuring results? A4.5.2.  Situation and Environment. What are the driving forces behind the training need? Are theseforces readily apparent, translatable to individual employee needs, and recognized by reviewing offi-cials? Some of the more critical and recognizable forces are: A4.5.2.1.  Acquisition of new systems or machines (weapons, computers, programs, etc.) thatneed highly specialized skills to maintain and operate. A4.5.2.2.  Radical technology shifts or new directions in the state-of-the-art. A4.5.2.3.  Civilian work force dynamics involving work force expansion, losses, resignations,retirements, promotions, and reassignments. (Analysis done by the staffing function in preparingthe staffing plan provides the data necessary to assess this influence.) A4.5.2.4.  Programs slated for implementation at a specified future date where additional skillswill be needed. A4.5.2.5.  Military-to-civilian manpower space conversions where labor market conditions areknown to be limited in supplying the associated skills. A4.5.2.6.  Employee performance can be used to determine whether training is necessary toenhance already high levels of performance or to improve substandard performance. If employeeperformance is deficient, determine whether the poor performance is based on definite formaltraining need rather than unwillingness to perform the duties of the job. NOTE: Assigning priorities for Continuous Learning (CL) with the Acquisition Workforce. CL aug-ments APDP training as indicated in paragarph 1.4.1. The CL requirement only begins to be a factor oncean individual has met the APDP certification requirements of his or her current position. Further informa-tion can be found at web site http://www.safaq.hq.af.mil/acq_workf/career_training/cl.html. A4.5.3.  Impact Estimation. Can a "bad case" situation be depicted and rationalized to show tangibleeffects of an unmet training need? Can lack of training be tied directly to a production, program, ormission problem? Can impact estimates be demonstrated by cost saving or avoidance analysis? Suchestimates must be documented to higher headquarters. A4.5.4.  Assigning Priorities.  Each variable must be carefully assessed.  Based on this analysis, a pri-ority must be assisgned according to the following definitions:  A4.5.4.1.  Priority 1 --Training that must be accomplished in the immediate training cycle toavoid an adverse mission effect. At the most urgent level, these requirements take priority over allothercommand and/or career program requirements. In using this rating, command and career programsare saying the training is critical for the day-to-day mission. A4.5.4.2.  Priority 2 --Training required for systematic replacement of skilled employees throughcareer management or other work force development programs in order to maintain the Air50AFI36-401   28 JUNE 2002Force’sreadiness posture. The training is needed to maximize the skill erosion factor. Deferment wouldhave an adverse mission effect over an intermediate term. A4.5.4.3.  Priority 3 --Training designed to increase the efficiency and productivity of adequately performing employees. Training fosters the effective use of resources to improve the Air Force’smission capability. Deferment beyond the immediate training cycle would have little immediateadverse mission effect, but would preclude or delay improving present mission accomplishment. A4.5.5.  MTC Review. MTC review actions should follow similar analyses in validating installationand command leveltraining and financial management plans. When appropriate, committees may alter priority codes. A4.5.6.  Advisory Role. EDMs and CEDMs should provide individual supervisors, managers, andrespective committee technical advice and assistance in the overall priority determination process. A4.6.  Part 3-Evaluating Courses and Developmental Experiences.  A4.6.1.  Measurement Techniques. Follow-on job performance is the most reliable method for evalu-ating effectiveness of any training course. Before accomplishing training, supervisors should select anevaluation method that can best measure the performance or productivity objective that the training isexpected to enhance. Objective may be to improve work quality, quantity, timeliness, or any combina-tion of these elements. Table A4.1. provides examples of evaluating methods that may be used tomeasure attainment of specific training objectives. A4.6.2.  Critiques. Another important evaluation tool is the course critique. Employees attending for-mal training or participating in a developmental experience must periodically be solicited for theirassessment of the training. A4.6.3.  Uses of Evaluation. The major purpose in evaluating training is to determine if training objec-tives have been achieved. The real value of course evaluation data, however, is its use in the follow-ing: A4.6.3.1.  Determining performance and productivity improvements. A4.6.3.2.  Making program changes or modifications, e.g., eliminating training of little value,changing content or method of training, reassessing or revising course objectives, and redirectingemphasis into more important or critical areas. A4.6.3.3.  Keeping management informed of training results and activities. A4.6.3.4.  Formulating future plans for training and development. A4.6.3.5.  Providing information to higher headquarters for the purpose of improving manage-ment decisions and budget and program support. A4.6.3.6.  Compiling quality reports that include narrative statements as to the value of training tothe installation. A4.7.  Part 4--Evaluating the Overall Training Program.  A4.7.1.  Program Evaluation. Program Evaluation of education and training functions include a sys-tematic review of operations in each function or organizational unit, on a continuing basis. The pri-AFI36-401   28 JUNE 200251mary uses of reviewing education and training evaluation data is to keep management informed of theeffectiveness of ongoing programs, the return-on-investment realized from these activities, and theneed to improve services. The EDM/S must be able to look beyond the evaluation of individual train-ing courses and integrate them into an evaluation of the total training program. Evaluation shouldattempt to estimate the extent to which economies and improved operations have resulted from train-ing. A4.7.2.  Evaluation Data. Sources of program evaluation data include assessment of the organizationand administration of training, the training itself, and the results of training. EDM should ensure a sys-tem is in place to manage and monitor an effective training program so that a quality assessment canbe made of adequacy of planning and the value of employee training and development.

Part 1--Financial Resource Planning.A5.1.1.  Forecasting.  Reliable forecasting of training is critical in meeting mission essential trainingneeds. Supervisors, managers, EDM/Ss, and appropriate committees should ensure that forecastingtakes into account all known requirements and that program and operations officials provide the bestestimates. Proper management of the needs identification and prioritization process increases accu-racy in predicting requirements and assures adequate funding levels in future years. A5.1.2.  Budget Formulation.  This action involves fine-tuning the next year's projected budgetbased on bogies issued by HQ USAF/DPDE during the third quarter of each fiscal year and the AITP.The following steps should be taken to execute this phase of financial planning: A5.1.2.1.  Obtain total funding requirement and determine the percentage of actual funding, e.g. a$10,000 bogey and a $20,000 requirement equals a 50-percent funding level. A5.1.2.2.  Cover as much of the highest priority training requirements as the funding level per-mits. This should establish a training priority funding level cutoff. A5.1.2.3.  Designate training requirements below the line as deferred requirements for possibleprogramming into the second out year. A5.1.2.4.  Prepare preliminary budget for presentation to and review by the MTC or the CECMC. A5.1.2.5.  Adjust, as necessary, within bogey limit and committee determinations. A5.1.2.6.  Request impact statements from functional managers for those priority one trainingrequirements that remain unfunded. A5.1.2.7.  Advise key managers of the funding level for their training requirements. (Use dataproducts). A5.2.  Part 2--Budget Execution.A5.2.1.  Executing.  An executing the current fiscal year budget, training resource managers shouldclosely monitor funding levels to ensure each quarter’s commitments and obligations are in line withtheir authorized funding authority. Should difficulties in meeting funding limitations arise, the appro-priate committees and key managers should be advised. A5.2.2.  Justifying. Before moving funding between quarters, the following justification should bedocumented: A5.2.2.1.  Explanation of the dollar amounts and time frames needed for the movement. A5.2.2.2.  Identification of the OBAN to be affected. A5.2.2.3.  Identification of MAJCOM or comparable organization requiring additional funding. A5.2.2.4.  Reconciliation of quarterly obligations based on the proposed movement. AFI36-401   28 JUNE 200255A5.2.3.  Additional Funding. When a need for additional funding has been identified, the EDM/Sshould assist functional management in preparing a written request to the parent MAJCOM whichincludes the following information: A5.2.3.1.  Why funds are needed .A5.2.3.2.  Why requirement was not included in the AITP.A5.2.3.3.  Impact statement describing mission impact if funding is not made available. A5.2.4.  Reporting Excess Funds. When excess funds have been identified, the condition must bereported to the parent MAJCOM. The parent MAJCOM will then readjust base funding levels andreport any excess to HQ USAF/DPDE. A5.2.5.  Processing and Documenting. Throughout the fiscal year, specific financial obligations andexpenditures occur. Several processing and documentation variations are encountered, depending onthe training source selected. A5.2.5.1.  Identification of the OBAN to be affected. A5.2.5.2.  A revised quarterly obligation rate based on approval of the additional funding. A5.2.5.3.  Table A5.1. reflects the processes and documentation involved with respective trainingsource selections. A5.2.5.4.  Training expense accounting is done by fund citation. Therefore, construction of thefund citation must be accurate. Components of a fund citation are in Table A5.2. Additionally,Table A5.3. is provided for when overseas travel is performed. For additional information regard-ing fund citations see the following web site: http://www.saffm.hq.af.mil/saffmra/dataeles/components.htm. A5.2.6.  Resource Management. The linkage between training forms, training records, and theaccounting system is designed to accomplish sound fiscal management and accountability. Trainingdocumentation needs to be timely and accurate for reconciliation with the accounting system. Therelationship between the two is displayed in Table A5.4. Close attention to the regular review offinancial status during the current fiscal year ensures sound budget execution. To accomplish this, sev-eral tools are available for use. Table A5.5. provides a listing of some of these tools that can assist inmanaging training resources. A5.2.7.  Closing Out the Fiscal Year. The final step in the budget execution process involves "bal-ancing the books". It requires a more concentrated review of fund status and end-of-year obligations.Closeout deadlines must be met to ensure an acceptable obligation rate. The following steps should betaken to ensure a smooth transition between fiscal years: A5.2.7.1.  Post all commitments by 31 August. A5.2.7.2.  Assign appropriate fund citations to track training costs extending into the next fiscalyear. A5.2.7.3.  Deliver final obligation documents to DAO/AFO by 15 September (or nearest workingday) each year. A5.2.7.4.  Reconcile all obligations and accounts by 24 September (or the nearest working day) ofeach year. 56AFI36-401   28 JUNE 2002A5.2.8.  Managing Training Costs For Delivery in Subsequent Fiscal Years  A5.2.8.1.  Flexibility in the management of civilian training funds is established by comptrollerdecision (CG B238940, 25 Feb 91) with regards to situations when costs for training are paid inone fiscal year and require delivery of training in a subsequent fiscal year. Training offices maywish to use this decision with the following guidance: A5.2.8.1.1.  Document the training need during the financial planning process, or earlier, thenensure the fund requirement is documented with approval in the budget process that supportsthe requirement. A5.2.8.1.2.  Complete appropriate training forms, i.e., DD For 1556 or AF Form 9, reserve atraining space with the provider, and obligate current year funds as required by DFAS-DE7000.4-R (https://dfas4dod.dfas.mil/library/publication/dfasdepubs.htm) which addressesyear-end obligations of funds for training. A5.2.8.1.3.  Ensure that the time between contracting and delivery is not excessive. An exam-ple is when the training is not available until early in the next fiscal year and the obligation ofcurrent year funds is necessary to acquire the training. The time between contracting anddelivery would be excessive if there is sufficient time to contract and deliver training during afiscal year. A5.2.8.1.4.  The training has to be unique and not a standard course available from anothersource. AFI36-401   28 JUNE 200257Table A5.1.  Training Source and Financial Table. When the most effective source is to use a non-government training coursedesigned specifically for Air Force needs anddirect trainee costs are involved use  non-government  training  that  is“off-the-shelf” or open to the general publicon a regularly scheduled basis Arrange for continuing education serviceswith recognized educational institution use a government training facility other thanDoD then the transaction involves EDM/S certification of AF Form 9 (or AF 4009if using GPC card) authorized and an approvedDD Form 1556. AF Form 9 must containspecifications of the type training needed tosatisfy the need. Payment is made with SF1034/invoice then processed by contractingofficer (or by sending AF 4009 to Accountingand Finance). EDM/S certification of DD Form 1556. DoDrequirement to use contracting procedures fortraining of this type up to $25,000 is waived.Payment is made either with SFs 1034/1080 (orby sending AF 4009 to Accounting andFinance if using GPC card), if training is beingused by other federal agencies and transfer ofappropriation is needed. EDM/S certification of a DD Form 1556,which  authorizes  establishment  of  aneducational services agreement or extension ofone already in existence  (see  DefenseAcquisition Regulation; Part 900).

Objective and Program Features.A6.1.1.  Program. New employee orientation programs are designed to assist new employees inadjusting readily to their jobs and work environments. Local procedures may require attendance byemployees at a variety of orientation programs. Supervisors must release employees for attendance atappropriate orientations. A6.1.2.  Objective. The main objective is to provide information that will help employees understandthe Air Force mission, Core Values, owning command mission, functions of their units, conditionsand requirements for employment, and to acquire positive motivation at the outset. A6.2.  Basic Program Components.  A6.2.1.  Orientation Interview. Initial interview conducted by a CPF representative during person-nel processing of all new employees. Information furnished covers such subjects as housing, transpor-tation, installation facilities, duty hours, pay and pay periods, and insurance benefits. A6.2.2.  Job Induction. Accomplished by the immediate supervisor on arrival of an employee newlyassigned to a unit. When a new employee reports to a unit, job induction should include these activi-ties: A6.2.2.1.  Welcoming and introducing the employee to coworkers and higher-level supervisors. A6.2.2.2.  Reviewing and discussing the employee's position description. A6.2.2.3.  Explaining the work of the unit and the relationship between the employee's work andthat of her or his coworkers. A6.2.2.4.  Reviewing the employee's performance plan, including requirements and standards andFTP, if applicable. A6.2.2.5.  Reviewing all materials, manuals, etc., that may be needed on the job and an explana-tion of any relevant safety practices. A6.2.2.6.  Explaining the chain of command and points of contact for information and assistance.If union stewards are assigned, appropriate introductions should be made. A6.2.2.7.  Explaining any unit customs or practices that may not be standard throughout the instal-lation, such as hours of duty, lunch and authorized break periods, approving officers for leave, andsimilar matters. A6.2.2.8.  Touring the work area and available facilities. A6.2.2.9.  Identifying and discussing any areas of work with which the employee may not befamiliar and for which she or he may require special attention or training. A6.2.2.10.  Establishing a definite schedule of assistance for the first few weeks or months of theemployee's service. A6.2.2.11.  Assigning initial duties and encouraging the employee to ask questions. 62AFI36-401   28 JUNE 2002A6.2.3.  Group or Desk Orientation. These are orientations given by a representative of the CPF toall employees new to the Air Force. Portions of this orientation may also be locally required foremployees newly assigned from other Air Force activities and former Air Force employees followinga break in service. Group orientations should be conducted at regular intervals, but, if employmentvolume is low, desk orientations may be used for one to four employees at a time. In either case, theorientation should be furnished within 90 days of the employee’s arrival on the installation. Topics tobe covered should include: A6.2.3.1.  Mission of and orientation to the Air Force, the command, and the installation A6.2.3.2.  Air Force Core Values A6.2.3.3.  Availability of the Air Force Chief of Staff’s civilian reading list (http://www.af.mil/lib/csafbook/csaf_read_civilian.shtml) and the on-line Aerospace PowerCourse (http://www.apc.maxwell.af.mil/) A6.2.3.4.  Employee's rights, opportunities, and privileges A6.2.3.5.  Responsibilities and obligations of Air Force employees, including restrictions withregard to gratuities and outside activities A6.2.3.6.  Leave, pay, health benefits, insurance, retirement, and compensation for injury, and, ifapplicable, special entitlements such as living quarters allowance A6.2.3.7.  Health, safety, and drug and alcohol abuse (see AFI 35-810) A6.2.3.8.  Merit promotion policy, equal employment opportunity policy, and incentive awardsprograms A6.2.3.9.

The CEP is primarily designed to document required training and development needs forregistrants in Air Force career programs. The CEP replaces the individual development plan (IDP) andprovides an in-system interface between individual training requirements and the career program trainingbudget process. The CEP is generated from a data system. A CEP is required for all career program regis-trants and may be used at major command (MAJCOM) or local discretion for other employees. A7.2.  Parts to the CEP Document.  A7.2.1.  Required Training--Part 1.  A7.2.1.1.  Contains information on employee training requirements and needs as identified by thefirst-level supervisor and approving official. A7.2.1.2.  Training requirements are revalidated, annually, in conjunction with the annual trainingsurvey. A7.2.1.3.  Indicates course title or course number to help identify courses. A7.2.1.4.  Must contain required courses (identified by career programs) available through centralfunding. Information on courses and seminars approved for local funding by base-level trainingand development committees may be included at local discretion. A7.2.1.5.  Supervisors should review required training carefully during the annual training surveyand, after consultation with the EDM/S, determine which courses will not be provided by the endof the fiscal year and determine whether to delete a course or request it for the following year. If acourse is retained, place a new start date on the CEP. New requirements may be added to the formin pen or pencil. This information may be used when building the annual training plan. A7.2.2.  Training History--Part II.  A7.2.2.1.  Contains information on training courses and seminars previously completed by theemployee. A7.2.2.2.  Allows supervisors to quickly identify which employees have not completed requiredor mandatory training. A7.2.2.3.  Provides information on courses completed in residence, by correspondence, or throughan equivalent course. A7.3.  Approvals.  A7.3.1.  Signature of the supervisor reflects agreement with the required training and willingness torelease the employee. A7.3.2.  The approving official has final authority to ensure the employee will be released to attendtraining as scheduled. The approving authority may be the next level supervisor or other official asdesignated by the career program. AFI36-401   28 JUNE 200265A7.4.  Linkage with the Annual Training Survey. Each career program registrant, in conjunction withthe annual training survey must have a CEP that links training to maintaining or improving performance.In preparing the CEP, the supervisor and employee tailor enhancement activities to individual needs. Thesupervisor may also use the CEP to help evaluate achievement or enhancement objectives during theannual performance appraisal process. A7.5.  CEP Process.  A7.5.1.  CEPs are generated by the CPF for all career program registrants during the annual trainingsurvey and may be used as a survey document. Copies are provided to each organizational supervisorto assist them in determining centrally funded training requirements for the forthcoming fiscal year. A7.5.2.  Supervisors review and discuss the CEP with employee and revise the plan based on individ-ualized needs assessment, career goals, and centralized training and development activities offered bycareer programs. Information contained in Parts I-III of the CEP is sent to the CPF. A7.6.  Data Products. CPF may wish to develop data products to be used in analysis of, and advice tomanagement on, the career program registrant population, i.e. provide data products to each organizationthat lists career program registrants who do not have required training identified. 66AFI36-401   28 JUNE 2002Attachment 8  INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AND COMPLETION OF DD FORM 1556, REQUEST, AUTHORIZATION AGREEMENT, CERTIFICATION OF TRAINING AND REIMBURSEMENT A8.1.

EWI programs are designed to develop qualities and abilities in selected officers and civilians neces-sary for effective acquisition management and professional or technical leadership. Since an individualized program is the intent of EWI, each company is encouraged to establish a program unique to itself and to the needs of the student. Application for this program is made through AFPC/DPK. (For further instructions for EWI see AFIT Instruction 36-103.) The STREAMLINE program is a short-term program which is designed to improve acquisition relation-ships between the government and major contractors. The program places highly experienced contracting officers and civilians with various civilian contractors for five to six months. Upon completion of the pro-gram, all students are required to write a report summarizing their ideas for improving government and/or industry processes, based on their work with industry. 88AFI36-401   28 JUNE 2002Attachment 16  GUIDE FOR RETRAINING WORKERS A16.1.  Differences Between Training and Retraining Retraining programs are designed to prepareindividuals for different careers, or to perform differently. The term "training" as we know it, is generallydesigned to help us perform our current jobs better. OPM defines retraining as (1) training and otherdevelopment administered to an individual to close skills gaps resulting from obsolescence; and (2) train-ing and development designed to equip an individual with knowledge and skills leading to another occu-pation. Retraining focuses on the basic competencies needed in a new or redesigned job and rarelyaddresses advanced level technical skills. A16.2.  Purposes of Retraining.   Retraining assists agencies in redirecting their human resources toaddress skill imbalances or projected skill shortages resulting from internal and external factors. Agenciescan use retraining programs to expand the knowledge and skills of workers through multi-skilling andcross-training; and to help stabilize the work environment and build morale, particularly when used as analternative to downsizing. A16.3.  Current Laws Affecting Retraining.   Several valuable programs are available for retrainingemployees, as described below: A16.3.1.  Economic Dislocation and Worker Adjustment Assistance Act assists workers who havebeen laid off and are unlikely to return to their previous occupation. A16.3.1.1.  Administered by the Department of Labor, this program allows a wide range of ser-vices to help individuals such as skills assessments, job development, counseling, and job searchassistance. A16.3.2.  Section 5 CFR 410.301(c), which is derived from Chapter 41 of title 5 U.S.C., permits agen-cies to retrain employees for other occupations based on organizational needs and when vacanciesexist. If new jobs offer more promotion potential to employees, the employees must also compete toenter retraining programs. These competitive processes must be consistent with merit principles andEEO considerations. A16.3.2.1.  The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 amended Chapter 41, section4101(4) of title 5, U.S.C. to define "training" as the process of providing for and making availableto an employee, and placing or enrolling the employee in, a planned, prepared, and coordinatedprogram, course, curriculum, subject, system, or routine of instruction or education, in scientific,professional, technical, mechanical, trade, clerical, fiscal, administrative, or other fields whichwill improve individual and organizational performance and assist in achieving the agency's mis-sion and performance goals. A16.3.2.2.  The Act also amended section 4103(b) by allowing the agencies to train any employeeof the agency to prepare that employee for placement in another agency, if the head of the agencydetermines that such training would be in the best interests of the Government. The amendmentrelaxed the requirement that the employee be faced with separation before he or she could betrained for placement in another agency. AFI36-401   28 JUNE 200289A16.3.3.  In January 1995, the U. S. Office of Personnel Management issued final regulations thatauthorize an agency to issue a Certification of Expected Separation (CES) to an employee who theagency expects will be separated within 6 months by a reduction in force. The CES notice allowsemployees to register early for outplacement and retraining services provided by the agency, OPM,and through programs under the Job Training Partnership Act administered by the Department ofLabor. A16.4.  Elements of A Successful Retraining Program.   A good agency retraining program shouldhave the following elements: A16.4.1.  Top management support; A16.4.2.  Program goals linked to the strategic goals of the organization; A16.4.3.  Good communication and information sharing; A16.4.4.  Retrainees are assured of placement; A16.4.5.  Management ensures that employees who enter retraining programs have the basic skillsrequired for entry; A16.4.6.  Employee selection for the programs is designed so retrainees have the greatest opportunityfor success; A16.4.7.  A retraining team should be formed for large organizations; A16.4.8.  Needs assessment is conducted to determine what competencies are needed for new occupa-tions; A16.4.9.  A retraining curriculum is developed; A16.4.10.  Managers and Human Resource professionals of the new organization help develop anddeliver components of the program; A16.4.11.  The program incorporates counseling to help employees cope with the psychological con-sequences of changing or losing jobs; A16.4.12.  The program includes technical, interpersonal, and analytical skills training as well asactivities that help individuals adjust to other work cultures or environments; and, A16.4.13.  The program includes classroom and structured on-the-job training. A16.5.  Department Of Labor and State Employment Services Activities.   The State EmploymentOffices offer many services for employees facing the possibility of job loss. For those facing unemploy-ment, the local state employment office serves not only to make referrals but is usually the office whereemployees get unemployment compensation. If planned in advance, many such offices will provide per-sonnel who will come on-site to register employees and explain their rights and benefits. Employmentcounselors may also be available to be on-site for lunchtime presentations to job clubs. Early contact withthe state employment office is often beneficial to allow the local office to prepare for registration of dis-placed employees. Attachment 17  CIVILIAN CAREER DEVELOPMENT PATH 90AFI36-401    28JUNE2002
