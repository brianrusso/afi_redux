Supplements (other than Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command) must be routed to  Headquarters  USAF  Manpower,  Organization  and  Resources,  Manpower  Organization Division (AF/A1MO) for coordination prior to further staffing.  AFI content changes, related to ANG  and  AFRC,  must  be  approved  by  the  Director  of  the  Air  National  Guard  (NGB/CF) through the ANG Manpower, Organization, and Resources Division (NGB/A1M); or Air Force Reserve  (AF/RE)  through  the  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  Manpower,  Organization  and Resources  Division  (AFRC/A1M),  respectively.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES The  Directorate  of  Manpower,  Organization  and  Resources  (AF/A1M)  is  now  responsible  for this publication.  The guidance was streamlined and simplified. 1.  General  Guidelines.  Mission  directives  provide  general  guidance  about  an  organization's mission  and  communicate  the  unit's  mission  and  responsibilities  to  the  commander  and  unit personnel.  Mission directives describe what  an organization does, not how it does it. They are written  at  the  executive  level.  A  checklist  of  specific  tasks  is  not  appropriate  for  the  general guidance commanders provide in  mission  directives.  AFPD 38-6 provides the policy  guidance on mission directives.  The following is a summary of the key guidelines in AFPD 38-6: 1.1.  Every unit in the Air Force will have a mission directive; (reference AFI 38-101 for the definition of a unit.) 1.1.1.  Detachments  and  other  activities  below  squadron  level  do  not  require  a  mission directive, unless directed by the MAJCOM, DRU, or FOA commander. 1.1.2.  When two or more subordinate units have the same mission, the MAJCOM, DRU, or FOA may issue a single mission directive. For example, when several wings have the same  mission,  only  one  mission  directive  is  necessary  for  those  wings.  Similarly,  for example, a wing with three flying squadrons with the same mission need issue only one mission directive for all three squadrons. 1.1.3.  At their discretion, MAJCOMs may waive the requirement for a mission directive for units below the Numbered Air Force level which have a current Designed Operational Capability  statement  in  accordance  with  AFI  10-201,  Status  of  Resources  and  Training System. 1.2.  MAJCOMs,  DRUs,  and  FOAs  issue  mission  directives  for  each  directly  assigned  and Air Reserve Component gained unit. MAJCOMs may delegate the authority to issue mission directives to subordinate units. 1.3.  The  OPR,  certifying  authority,  and  approving  authority  for  an  organization’s  mission directive must be in a higher level organization within its chain of command. AFI38-601  7 JANUARY 2015   3  2.  MAJCOM,  DRU  and  FOA  AFMDs.  HAF  OPRs will use these  guidelines for developing AFMDs for each MAJCOM, DRU, FOA, and selected office. The Vice Chief of Staff approves AFMDs  for  MAJCOMs  and  DRUs.  FOA  mission  directives  are  approved  by  the  appropriate HAF  two-digit  official  (e.g.,  SAF/IG,  AF/A3/5).    For  FOAs  that  fall  under  a  HAF  two-digit official  without  subordinate  three-digit  offices,  the  HAF  two-digit  office  will  be  the  certifying official  and  AF/CVA  and  SAF/AA  will  be  the  approval  authorities  for  FOAs  of  Air  Staff  and Secretariat organizations, respectively. 2.1.  The HQ USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel and Services (AF/A1): 2.1.1.  Maintains a focal point and central repository for all matters pertaining to AFMDs (AF/A1MO). 2.1.2.  Determines the certifying authority for each MAJCOM, DRU, FOA, and selected office AFMD (Attachment 2).  The certifying authority will in turn, appoint an OPR (e.g., three  or  four-digit  staff  office).    During  the  AFMD’s  review  every  4  years  or  as necessary, certifying officials will review the OPR designation to ensure it is up-to-date. 2.2.  Each AFMD OPR will: 2.2.1.  Prepare assigned AFMDs. 2.2.2.  Revise  the  AFMD  when  the  mission  changes.  Revisions  shall  include  adding  or deleting items that are essential to the overall Air Force mission, but are not necessarily essential  to  the  command's  primary  mission.  Revisions  will  not  include  expanding  the organization's  administrative  or  housekeeping  duties,  such  as  personnel,  administration, or logistics. 2.2.3.  Coordinate new and revised AFMDs at the HAF level in accordance with AFI 33-360. 3.  MAJCOM, DRU, and FOA commanders: 3.1.  Issue and control mission directives for their subordinate units. 3.2.  Appoint OPRs to prepare mission directives. 3.3.  Appoints  an  OPR  as  the  focal  point  and  maintainer  of  a  central  repository  of  mission directives. 4.  Preparing  a  Mission  Directive.  OPRs  at  every  level  will  use  these  guidelines  and  the sample (Attachment 3) when preparing mission directives. 4.1.  Create  a  broad  outline  of  the  principal  components  of  the  organization's  mission,  but provide sufficient detail to clarify the following: 4.1.1.  Mission.  Include all necessary elements of the organization's mission and duties. 4.1.2.  Command.  Specify the relationships, if applicable, between: 4.1.2.1.  HAF and commanders of MAJCOMs, DRUs, FOAs, or selected offices. 4.1.2.2.  The organization or command and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 4.1.2.3.  The Air Force components and the unified command of assignment.   4  AFI38-601  7 JANUARY 2015 4.1.2.4.  The  organization  and  other  Air  Force  organizations,  government  agencies, US  Military  Services  and  the  Armed  Forces  and  government  agencies  of  other nations. 4.1.3.  Responsibilities.  Identify  the  mission  elements  assigned  by  unified  commanders, specified  commanders,  or  higher  authorities.  Define  the  commander's  responsibility  for executing those elements of the mission. 4.2.  Legal or higher headquarters direction.  Cite any laws or  higher headquarter directives (e.g.  Department  of  Defense  Directives  or  Instructions)  that  provide  specific  direction regarding the organization’s mission, responbilibites, and command relationships. 4.3.  Length.  Be brief; if possible, limit to no more than two pages. 4.4.  Language and Tone.  The mission directive is an order from a superior commander to a subordinate  commander.  The  mission  directive  directs  action.  Use  simple,  clear,  and  direct language to make mission directives easy to understand. 4.5.  Subparagraphs.  The  nature  of for subparagraphs.  For  example,  under  the  main  paragraph  "Mission,"  Air  Combat  Command might  discuss  "Preparing  Forces"  and  "Providing  Forces"  in  subparagraphs.  Other MAJCOMs  might  discuss  "Test  and  Evaluation"  or  "Training."  Keep  the  focus  at  the executive level rather than on specifics. the  organization  determines the  headings 4.6.  Security Classification.  Do not classify mission directives. Classified supplements may be prepared, if necessary, to describe a unit's mission. 5.  Mission Directive Numbering. 5.1.  MAJCOM,  DRU,  and  FOA  AFMDs.  Use  the  numbers  in  Attachment  2  (for  example, the mission directive for Air Combat Command is AFMD 2).  AF/A1 will assign, delete, or change AFMD numbers as necessary.  Numbers may be  re-used three years after rescission of the last MD to use the number. 5.2.  Unit-Level Mission Directives.  Units below the MAJCOM, DRU, and FOA will begin with  the  parent  organization's  abbreviation  followed  by  three  digits,  assigned  at  the organization's discretion (e.g., Air Combat Command mission directives would be numbered ACCMD  XXX).  Each  MAJCOM,  DRU,  and  FOA  will  publish  a  list  of  all  organization mission directives.  DANIEL R.
