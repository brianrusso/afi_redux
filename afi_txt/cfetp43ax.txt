Preface 1.1.1.  The  43AX  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP)  is  a  comprehensive  core  training document that identifies minimum education and training requirements and support resources for the 43AX Air Force Specialty (AFS). The plan is a "training road map" for the AOP officer career field, providing personnel with a clear path to success and makes career field training identifiable, measureable, and budget-defensible. The CFETP instills rigor to the first 30 months of career field training and consists of two parts; Part  I  contains  general  information  about  the  CFETP  and  career  field  progression  information.    Part  II contains  a  comprehensive  list  of  mandatory  in-residence  courses  and  on-the-job  training  requirements.  Supervisors of AOP officers are directed to use both parts to manage 43A training.  1.1.1.1. Section A of Part II is entitled Course Training Standard (CTS), but highlights the Specialty Training Standard (STS) – an AF publication that describes an AFS in terms of tasks, knowledge, and experience an Airman in that specialty may be expected to perform or to know on the job. The STS is the  foundational  document  for  the  development  of  formal  courses  and  OJT-based  education  and training requirements. At the unit level, AOP Flight Commanders will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this CFETP.   1.1.2.  Use  of  the  guidance  provided  in  this  CFETP  provides  the  foundation  for  effective  and  efficient education and training of individuals in the 43AX career field (including Reservists) during the first 30 months of their career.  After using/completing the CFETP for this purpose, the document should accompany the AOP officer from assignment-to-assignment until they attain the rank of O-5.  1.1.3. For questions concerning this CFETP, send an email to: usafsam.fepe.43A@us.af.mil.        3 1.2. Section A – General Information 1.2.1. Purpose. This CFETP provides information necessary for the Biomedical Sciences Corps (BSC) Associate  Chief  (43AX),  AFMSA/SG3PT,  AOP  Lead  Command  (AETC/A3FM),  MAJCOM  AOP Program  Managers,  AOP  Flight  Commanders,  and  the  United  States  School  of  Aerospace  Medicine (USAFSAM) Aerospace Physiology Division (FEP) to plan, develop, and manage career field education and training. The CFETP outlines the required education, training, and experience individuals in the 43AX AFS must attain for skill level progression (see Table 2.1.). For purposes of this plan, training is divided into  Initial  skills  (entry-level)  and  upgrade  training.  Initial  skills  training  is  mandatory  training  for  all officers,  and  is  usually  conducted  by  USAFSAM/FEP  faculty.  Upgrade  training  (UGT)  identifies  the mandatory in-residence courses, educational requirements, and experience requirements for award of the 43A3 AFS (fully qualified).  IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, the CFETP is the primary document used to outline training requirements at appropriate points in an officer’s career.  Failure to progress  in  training  IAW  this  CFETP  can  result  in  a  Commander’s  recommendation  to  withdraw  the member from training and from the AFS. The CFETP also lists assignment-specific training that is required for  AOP  officers  to increase  their  knowledge  and  skills  beyond  the  minimum  required  for  upgrade  to prepare them to conduct assignment and/or mission-specific duties. 1.2.2. CFETP Maintenance and Use. The CFETP is maintained and certified by the BSC Associate Corps Chief (43AX). Under the direction of the Associate Corps Chief, the CFETP will be reviewed annually. USAFSAM/FEP is the primary office of responsibility for facilitating CFETP maintenance. AOP officers at all levels will use the plan to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive education and training program is available for the 43AX AFS. 1.2.2.1.  USAFSAM/FEP  staff  develops  and  revises  formal  resident  training  based  on  requirements established via annual CFETP reviews and/or Utilization and Training Workshops (U&TWs). Those training offerings are documented in Attachment 3 of this CFETP. USAFSAM/FEP is also responsible for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 1.2.2.2.  The  BSC  Associate  Corps  Chief  (43A),  AOP  Program  Managers,  and  AOP  subject  matter experts  (SMEs)  determine  and  develop  43A  upgrade  training  based  on  career  field  requirements established during CFETP reviews and/or U&TWs.  The education, training, and experience required for upgrade to the 43A3 AFS are listed in Part II, Table 2.1.  1.2.2.3. MAJCOM AOP Program Managers must identify and develop assignment-specific task and knowledge  requirements  to  support  this  AFS  for  inclusion  in  this  plan.  For  any  such  unique requirements, AOP Program Managers must also identify and develop (when required) associated AF Qualification Training Packages (AFQTPs).  USAFSAM/FEP may assist with AFQTP development.           4 1.3. Section B – Career Field Progression Information 1.3.1. Specialty Description. Trains in hypobaric (altitude) chamber operations, aeromedical aspects of flight,  sensory  physiology,  aviation  life  support  systems,  acceleration  physiology,  emergency  egress, aircraft  mishap  investigation  concepts,  and  Airman  performance  enhancement,  sustainment  and optimization. Leads and manages AOPTUs and AOPTTs. Specific duties include: Instructs personnel in Aerospace  and  Operational  Physiology  and  related  human  factors  (HF)  outlined  in  AFI  11-403  and associated MAJCOM supplements. Plans, conducts, and directs aerospace physiology acquisition, science and technology programs; manages specialized physiology support divisions for high altitude projects; manages Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) functions when required; supervises Aerospace and Operational Physiology programs at Air Staff, MAJCOM, or FOA staff level.  1.3.2. Skill and Career Progression. 1.3.2.1. Adequate training and timely progression from entry level (43A1) to the qualified level (43A3) are integral to ensuring the AOP program can accomplish its goal. It is essential that everyone involved in training does his or her part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program. The guidance provided in this CFETP will help to ensure each individual receives timely and AFS-relevant training at appropriate points in their career. 1.3.2.1.1. Initial Skills (43A1). Initial/entry-level training (e.g. AOPO 101) is managed, developed, and taught by USAFSAM AOP faculty.  Initial training is outlined in Attachment 3. 1.3.2.1.2. Fully Qualified (43A3). Completion of 43A3 upgrade training requirements (e.g. AOPO 201 and 202 phases) is managed by AOP Flight Commanders and AOP Program Managers.  Upgrade training is outlined in Attachment 3. 1.3.2.1.3.  Staff  (43A4).  Designation  of  staff-level  AFSC  relates  only  to  the  level  of  functional responsibility i.e., positions above wing level that are responsible for creating policy and evaluating policy effectiveness.  While 43A4 does not require additional specialty qualification above that of 43A3 at this time, it is recommended that officers selected for staff positions complete the following online  courses  at  their  earliest  possible  convenience:  ACQ  101  (Fundamentals  of  Systems Acquisition) and LOG 101 (Acquisition Logistics Fundamentals).  These courses can be accessed on the Defense Acquisition University website at http://www.dau.mil/default.aspx. 1.3.2.1.4. Assignment-Specific Training Requirements. Assignment-specific training requirements are  unique  to  an  AOP  location  and  are  not  considered  core  43A  upgrade  requirements.                          The AOP officer should receive OJT or complete identified in-residence courses (as applicable) as soon as possible after being assigned to the specified base.  Assignment-specific training is outlined in Attachment 4. 1.3.2.1.5. Optional Courses. In addition to initial and upgrade training requirements, AOP officers may attend optional courses (at the discretion of their supervisor and time/funds permitting) in order to enhance their understanding of human factors in AF missions and operations.  A list of optional courses for AOP officers can be found in Attachment 5 of this document.   1.3.3.  Training  Decisions  and  Management.  The  BSC  Associate  Corps  Chief  (43A)  is  the  CFETP approval  authority.  The  Associate  Corps  Chief  will  initiate  an  annual  review  (every  January,  unless specified otherwise) to ensure CFETP currency, accuracy, and relevancy.  During the review period, the Associate Corps Chief, AFMSA/SG3PT, AETC/A3FM, and  AOP Program Managers  will identify and coordinate on career field training requirements that will be included in and/or removed from the CFETP.  Using the list of task, knowledge, and activities listed in Attachments 3 and 4, they will eliminate duplicate training to ensure the training system is as efficient as possible.  The Associate Corps Chief will also determine if/when/where a U&TW should be convened to address CFETP issues that cannot be resolved during the annual review. 5  1.3.4. 43A Career Paths. Figure 1 highlights the three potential career paths available to officers in the 43A AFS.  Figure 1 also outlines typical assignments and Development Education commensurate with rank progression. Officers should strive to begin a successful career by building primary job proficiency through a  strong  technical  foundation  and  experience.    Follow  that  up  by  building  depth  through  increased leadership opportunities. Finally, officers should focus on building breadth by expanding possibilities at different  levels.  Career  progression  opportunities  must  be  carefully  planned  by  not  only  considering professional goals, but personal ones as well (e.g., marriage, children, special needs, etc.).       Figure 1. 43AX Career Field Pyramid     6 1.3.4.1.  MyVECTOR.  In  the  summer  of  2015,  the  Career  Path  Tool  (CPT)  was  re-launched  as MyVECTOR. MyVECTOR is an enterprise solution that supports the Air Force's goal to provide a standardized process available to all Airmen for career development and mentoring. The latest version of MyVECTOR will allow Airmen to establish mentoring relationships. Mentors will be able to see an Airman's career pyramid and duty history in order to facilitate career planning within MyVECTOR. The program  is  not  mandatory  but  is  encouraged.  Mentors  ensure  all  mentees  under  their  guidance  are personally  and  professionally  developed  so  they  can  achieve  their  work-related  personal  and organizational goals, and ultimately strengthen the overall mission of the Air Force. MyVECTOR and the CPT are both located on the Air Force Mentoring website at https://afaems.langley.af.mil/afmentoring. User guides are available under the ‘Help’ tab upon login.      1.3.4.1.1. Mentoring.  MyVECTOR enables a web-based mentoring network that allows mentees to manage their career development with the input and guidance from a mentor. Mentees will be able to, in real-time, invite participants to serve as mentors, select mentors based on preferences, chat with their mentor online, and complete a mentoring plan. Airmen with an existing mentoring relationship will  likely  choose  the  “Direct  Connect”  mentor  option.  By  officially  connecting  to  your  mentor through MyVECTOR, your mentor can view your career progression and future plans. Airmen with a specific need or who are unable to find a mentor will likely use the “Find a Mentor” function. Mentors  are selected  by  mentees based  on  whom  they  admire/respect and  who have  appropriate insight into professional and personal development.   1.3.4.1.2. Career Planning. MyVECTOR allows the user to view their duty experience through career field specific experience codes. This structure also allows the user to build career plans based on real opportunities and to share these career plans with development teams and mentors. A Bullet-Tracker option  allows  the  user  to  track  specific  events  and  accomplishments  throughout  the  year  for Performance Reports. 1.3.4.1.3. Knowledge Sharing. MyVECTOR provides Discussion Forums and links to resources for online  books  and  courses  that  discuss  mentoring  benefits,  the  differences  between  coaching  and mentoring and techniques for managing mentoring relationships.  1.3.5. AOP Officer Assignments. The following offices/organizations/individuals determine assignments based on the needs of the Air Force.  1.3.5.1. Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC).  AOP does not have a dedicated assignment officer at AFPC.  Instead, one BSC assignment officer makes decisions for multiple career fields based on the needs of the AF and input from the BSC Associate Corps Chief (43AX). 1.3.5.2. Associate Corps Chief.  The Associate Corps Chief (43AX) provides a comprehensive list of requirements  at  the  beginning  of  the  assignment  cycle  to  the  BSC  assignment  officer  and  makes assignment recommendations based on the needs of the AF and the career field.  If necessary, the Corps Chief  solicits  input  from  MAJCOM  AOP  Program  Managers,  Flight  Commanders,  or  individual officers. 1.3.5.3. MAJCOM AOP Program Managers/Flight Commanders. When solicited, individuals in these positions make assignment recommendations to the Associate Corps Chief.  To ensure they are prepared if/when called upon, they should continually assess the strengths, weaknesses, and unique qualifications of officers under their purview. 1.3.5.4.  Individual  Officers.  AOP  officers  should  indicate  assignment  preferences  to  their  Flight Commander  and/or  Program  Manager.    These  individuals  can  then  determine  which  assignment opportunities  align  with   Individuals  can  search  career  field authorizations/requirements  on the  Assignment  Management  System  (AMS)  website.  Here, authorizations and funded positions which will become available in the next assignment cycle are listed the  officer’s  career  plan. 7  by rank, AFSC, and location.  This information is updated only a few weeks prior to the spring, summer, and fall assignment cycles.  AMS does not always include all requirements. 1.3.5.5. Aerospace and Operational Physiology Training Unit (AOPTU). An AOP officer’s initial assignment  will  normally  be  at  an  AOPTU.  In  this  assignment,  the  AOP  officer  will  support  the operational or training mission forming the foundation of a career. Typically, new AOP officers start out as a section/element chief and will eventually progress to become an AOP Flight Commander. AOPTU assignments can range from a base with only two AOP officers and 10 enlisted AOP personnel to an AOPTU of 30 or more personnel (e.g., USAFSAM/FEP at Wright-Patterson AFB, 9th PSPTS at Beale AFB, or the HAAMS Center at Little Rock AFB). 1.3.5.6. Aerospace and Operational Physiology Training Team (AOPTT). An AOP officer’s second assignment will normally be at an AOPTT. In this assignment, the AOP officer will directly support the operational mission of a single MDS or multiple MDS at a composite wing. AOPTT’s are typically staffed  with  one  43A3  officer  and  one  4MO71  AOP  technician.    Typically,  at  least  one  AOPTU assignment is required prior to being assigned to an AOPTT. 1.3.5.7. Specialized AOP Officer Assignments. There are many unique assignments within the AOP career field that require additional education, training, and experience outside of what is required at a typical AOPTU or AOPTT.  Refer to Attachment 9 for a list and description of these assignments. 1.3.5.8. Developmental Assignments. Developmental assignments provide perspective on the AF and DoD  with  a  focus  other lens.  Adequate  career  field experience/knowledge is highly recommended prior to developmental assignments. AOP officers (and their  mentors  and/or  supervisors)  should  time/plan  developmental  opportunities  carefully  with promotion  schedules.  Some  opportunities  may  make  an  individual  less  competitive  at  Lieutenant Colonel (O-5) and O-6 boards if not timed appropriately. The key thing to remember about any special duty or developmental assignment is that it should be accomplished at the right career point. While the exact  timing  will  vary  by  individual  (typically  mid-Capt  to  junior  Maj),  AOP  officers  must  weigh personal  and  professional  desires  for  broadening  with  their  overall  development  and  career  goals. Developmental opportunities available to 43AX officers include, but are not limited to: through  an  AFMS  or  AOP than 1.3.5.8.1.  Royal  Air  Force  Exchange  Officer  (United  Kingdom).  Field  grade  officer  serves  as  a Human System Integration project manager.  The officer is responsible for testing and evaluation of Ministry of Defence aircrew flight clothing and equipment.  The officer also conducts AOP training and participates in operational flying. Familiarity with principles of defense acquisition and program management are necessary for success in this position.  1.3.5.8.2.  Aerospace  Physiology  Safety  Fellow,  Kirtland  AFB,  NM.    [Authorized  grades: Capt/Major]  This fellowship develops a solid understanding of the doctrine, policies, and processes of each AFSEC division through participation in mishap analysis, investigation support, formal report management, safety guidance development, and proactive safety initiatives. The officer participates in safety data management including integration of AFSAS and DoD HFACS tools. As part of the fellowship, the officer will attend formal safety courses, assist in safety evaluations, and engage with other agencies in preventive safety activities. 1.3.5.9. Staff Assignments. Staff assignments provide an opportunity to develop policy, monitor the effectiveness as the policy is executed, and adjust policy as necessary, along with other duties outlined in AFI 11-403.  All staff assignments are leadership positions, and are typically reserved for officers that have  attained  the  rank  of  Major,  Lt  Col,  or  Col.  AOP  officers  should  have  at  least  two  base-level assignments, Flight Command, and completed PME commensurate with rank prior to assuming staff assignment responsibilities.   8  1.3.5.9.1. BSC Associate Corps Chief, 43AX. [Authorized Grades: Lt Col/Col]  The Associate Corps Chief functions as the overall Air Force Advisor for the Aerospace and Operational Physiology Program and serves as consultant to the AF Surgeon General (ref AFI 44-104, Military and Civilian Consultant Program and Enlisted Career Field Manager Program). The Associate Corps Chief advises the Air Force Personnel Center on 43A career field personnel management and force development and is responsible for managing AOP officer education and training via the development, implementation, and maintenance of the 43A CFETP.  1.3.5.9.2. AETC/A3FM. [Authorized grades: Major/Lt Col] AETC serves as the lead command for aerospace physiology.  As the office of primary responsibility, AETC/A3FM manages the execution of the aerospace physiology program across the Air Force IAW AFI 11-403 and 11-404. Officers assigned to AETC/A3FM are responsible for establishing and interpreting aerospace physiology training policy and guidance and developing aerospace physiology courseware.  They also coordinate MAJCOM training requirements with the Aerospace Physiology System Program Office and manage the acquisition and life cycle management of aerospace physiology training devices.  AETC/A3FM also oversees the certification of foreign country physiology training. 1.3.5.9.3. Air Force Medical Support Agency (AFMSA), Falls Church, VA. [Authorized grade: Major]  The assigned officer directs executive/strategic development, planning, programming, and budgeting for all AOP program enterprise requirements. The officer also serves as AFMS liaison to 2-star Operational Directorate (AF/A35).  Duties include translating, integrating, and coordinating AF/SG  policy  and  taskings  and  coordination  of  AOP  strategy  and requirements  with  the  AFMS Aerospace Operational Panel and the Line of the Air Force (LAF) Personnel and Training Panel. 1.3.5.9.4. MAJCOM AOP Program Manager(s) (Multiple MAJCOMs). Officers, typically with advanced academic degrees, provide consultative support to Air Staff, base-level, AOPT, and deployed AOP personnel. AOP Program Managers enhance program effectiveness through organizing and equipping MAJCOM AOP personnel and by supporting mishap prevention and investigation efforts. Two base level assignments are typically necessary prior to this assignment. 1.3.5.9.5.  Human  Factors  and  Operational  Safety  Issues,  Safety  Issues  Division  (AF/SEI), Pentagon, Washington, DC.  [Authorized grade: Major] The assigned officer is the Air Force Chief of Safety's (AF/SE) Air Staff focal point for Air Force-level human factors, human performance, and operational safety issues working in conjunction with the Air Force Safety Center's (AFSEC) Human Factors Division.  The officer serves as the lead human factors liaison between AF Chief of Safety, AFSEC, AFMS, Air Staff, Joint Staff, OSD, and outside federal agencies and generates AF guidance on human factors in flight/weapons/occupational safety. The officer also serves as the primary staff action officer for HF/operational safety issues for the CSAF and SecAF. 1.3.5.9.6.  Chief,  Human  Factors  Investigation  Branch,  Air  Force  Safety  Center  (AFSEC), Kirtland AFB, NM.  [Authorized grades: Major/Lt Col] The assigned officer coordinates all AFSEC human factors functions, consults USAF Chief of Safety on physiological and human performance issues, and ensures accuracy of AF human factors guidance.  The officer supports aviation safety investigations, coordinates effective use of human factors coding and analysis in mishap reporting, and is responsible for human factors data collection and dissemination.  The assigned officer serves as a subject matter expert and instructor for formal safety courses, and represents AFSEC at multiple USAF, DoD, and NATO policy forums. 1.3.5.10. Command. Some AOP officers will have the opportunity to command a Squadron or Medical Group. It is critical for AFMS officers to understand the command application, nomination and selection process.  This  process  is  very  competitive.  Squadron  Commanders  are  O-5s,  and  Medical  Group Commanders are O-6s. Squadron Command or equivalent is generally required for promotion to O-6. Squadron Command is a two-step process. First, eligible O-5s (or O-5 selects) compete to be selected 9  information is choose their  Squadron  Commanders.  Additional for consideration. The BSC corporate board selects 1.5 to 2 times more BSCs than vacant positions. If selected,  the  officer  must  then  compete  to  be  matched  to  a  specific  squadron.  The  sitting  Group Commanders located on the AFMS Knowledge Exchange at https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx9/MedicalSqCommand/Pages/home.aspx.  1.3.5.11. Airman Development Plan (ADP). The ADP facilitates the Force Development process for officers (2d Lt through Lt Col). ADP provides raters/commanders with access to Career Briefs, Career Planning Diagrams, and eRecords. Additionally, it provides officers with the capability to communicate assignment,  developmental,  and  educational  preferences,  command/leadership  opportunities,  and career-broadening requests to their Development and Assignment/Career Field Teams. Officers must keep in mind when filling out their ADP that their assignment preferences are just that; the mission will always be the primary consideration in an assignment decision. Tutorials and answers to frequently asked  questions  pertaining  to  the  ADP  can  be  found  on  the  AFPC  myPers  website  at  https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/answers/detail/a_id/22179.  1.3.5.12. Establishing who is vulnerable to move. The intent of designating an officer “vulnerable” for reassignment  is  to  alert  the  officer  that  he/she  can  expect  to  be  matched  with  an  assignment  in  an upcoming assignment cycle. There are three assignment cycles: spring, summer and fall. Vulnerability is  determined  by  Date  Arrived  Station  (DAS),  tour  length  requirements,  and  current  Air  Force requirements. Basic eligibility for reassignment is 48 months’ Time-on-Station (TOS) by the pending departure date for moves CONUS to CONUS and 24 months TOS for moves CONUS to overseas. Although these represent the minimum requirements (per AF policy), unique career field dynamics may drive eligibility differences among Air Force specialties. For example, Rated officers have a minimum TOS for CONUS to CONUS moves of 36 months. As a result of force structure changes, the end-strength drawdown, AFSC mergers/consolidations, and manning shortages in certain grades, the minimum TOS listed above may, at times, be unattainable. Waivers must be sought in the event career field manning and requirements obligate an Officer Assignment Team (OAT) to dip beneath these minimums and should be used by exception only. In general, officers on stabilized CONUS tours or overseas with a Date Eligible for Return from Overseas (DEROS) will be identified as vulnerable to coincide with the expiration of the tour or DEROS. Officers on CONUS un-stabilized tours and overseas officers on an indefinite  DEROS  are eligible  for assignment  once  they  meet  minimum  TOS  requirements or have completed the normal prescribed overseas tour length by the Projected Departure Date (PDD) of the assignment. Each AFAS cycle commences when the Vulnerable to Move List (VML) is published in AMS. Approximately 7-10 months out from PCS cycle, the OAT will generate a VML. When the Initial VML  is  made  available,  commanders  must  review  it  closely.  This  gives  them  visibility  of  officers assigned to their organization who are vulnerable to move. In addition, there is a small window where a commander has an opportunity to request a reclama (i.e. request to add/ remove officers to/from the VML). These requests are commander-initiated in AMS and should be based on mission needs and/or extenuating circumstances. These requests should be submitted during the reclama window; if they are not completed in conjunction with the established timelines, they may not be considered. (Source: Air Force Assignment System (AFAS) User’s Guide) 1.3.6.  Education.  Together  with  training  and  experience,  education  is  one  of  the  pillars  of  military professionalism. While the Air Force will provide some formal education, it is usually only through highly competitive processes. Ultimately, it is incumbent upon the individual officer to prioritize and manage their time, both on and off duty, to achieve his or her educational goals. 1.3.6.1. Professional Military Education (PME). Air Force Developmental Education (DE) programs expand knowledge and increase understanding of the role of air, space and cyberspace power in times of  peace  and  war.  Air  Force  education  programs  prepare  Air  Force  personnel  to  anticipate  and successfully meet challenges across the range of military operations and build a professional corps. 10  Further, they positively impact both recruitment and retention efforts. The objectives of PME programs are  reflected  in  the  AF  Institutional  Competency  List  and  implemented  through  the  Air  University Continuum  of  Education.  To  be  competitive  for  promotion,  selective  assignments,  and  other developmental opportunities, officers MUST complete the appropriate level of PME for their grade. Officers  have  a  limited  window  of  opportunity  to  complete  PME,  governed  by  AFI  36-2301, Developmental Education. Given the time constraint, officers are highly encouraged to complete the available non-resident programs at their first opportunity. Deployments, remote assignments, and other life events may hinder an officer’s ability to complete non-resident or resident programs if they wait until the end of their eligibility window. PME is divided up into three sub-categories: 1.3.6.1.1. Primary Developmental Education (PDE). PDE programs are Squadron Officer School (SOS) and SOS-equivalent Inter-American Air Forces Academy (IAAFA) course (Source: AFI 36-2301, Developmental Education). The main focus of SOS is officership based on Air Force core values. SOS provides Air Force captains the leadership tools they need to build military teams and lays a foundation for critical thinking in air and space power through education on air power history and doctrine. Captains and Captain-selects are the target audience for PDE. 1.3.6.1.1.1. The PDE requirement can be met by completing SOS either in residence at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, or by distance learning (correspondence). However, Active Duty BSC officers are prohibited from enrolling in SOS DL until two years of time-in-grade as a captain (Source: AFI 36-2301, Developmental Education). The Air Force goal is for all Captains to attend in-residence SOS.   1.3.6.1.2. Intermediate Developmental Education (IDE). IDE programs are specified as Intermediate-Level Colleges (in the joint community and identified foreign schools) and/or Command and Staff Colleges, internships and fellowships, as well as certain graduate degree programs through Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), Advanced Study of Air Mobility (ASAM) and National Defense Intelligence College (NDIC). Command and Staff Colleges include: Air Command and Staff College (ACSC), sister service and Joint PME-I equivalent IDE-level foreign schools.  Majors  and  Major-selects  are  the  target  audience  of  IDE  (Source:  AFI  36-2301, Developmental Education).  1.3.6.1.2.1. The IDE requirement can be met by completing Air Command and Staff College (ACSC) either through distance learning, by attending an in-residence course at Maxwell AFB, AL or completing one of several equivalent in-residence IDE program options. AFPC publishes a list of IDE programs for each academic year on an annual basis. This publication can be found on either the AF Portal or on the myPers website. Non-resident distance learning is available to all officers selected for Major. Eligible officers can enroll in the distance learning course through the Air University Portal website https://www.my.af.mil/aurepmprod/auportal/welcome.AirUniversity. The availability of in-residence IDE options varies each year; in-residence slots are limited. There is potential to receive in-residence credit if IDE is completed in conjunction with a master’s degree.  Other  options  include  AF  Legislative  Fellowship  Program,  AF  National  Laboratory Technical Fellowship Program, and Army Command and General Staff College. An officer will not be able to apply for in-residence IDE until notified by AFPC of eligibility. Completing IDE by correspondence is recommended for officers wishing to be considered to attend in-residence IDE. 1.3.6.1.3. Senior Developmental Education (SDE). SDE programs are categorized as Senior-Level Colleges (in the joint community and identified foreign schools) and/or each Service’s War College, National Defense University programs (National War College and Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy), and certain fellowships. Lt Cols, Lt Col-selects, Colonels and  Colonel-selects  are  the  target  audience  of  SDE  (Source:  AFI  36-2301,  Developmental Education). 11  1.3.6.1.3.1.  The SDE requirement can be met by completing Air War College (AWC) either through distance learning, by attending an in-residence course at Maxwell AFB, Alabama,  or completing one of several equivalent in-residence SDE program options. AFPC publishes a list of SDE programs for each academic year on an annual basis. This publication can be found on either the AF Portal or on the myPers website. Non-resident distance learning is available to all officers selected for Lieutenant Colonel. Eligible officers can enroll in the distance learning course through the Air University Portal website. Selection for in-resident SDE is extremely competitive, with very limited opportunity for BSC officers. The availability of in-residence SDE options varies each year; the most common SDE option is AWC in-residence. Other options include RAND Fellowships and National Laboratory Technical Fellowship Program. An officer will not be able to  apply  for  in-residence  SDE  until  notified  by  AFPC  of  eligibility.  Completing  SDE  by correspondence is generally a prerequisite for officers wishing to be considered for attending in-residence SDE. 1.3.6.2.  Advanced  Academic  Degrees  (AAD).  Obtaining  an  AAD  makes  an  AOP  Officer  more knowledgeable/credible, may assist in promotion opportunity at the O-6 board, enhances a member’s value to the Air Force, and can bolster a resume in case a member decides to separate. Currently, it is not required to obtain a master’s degree until the O-6 board. However, since historically the policy on masking  degrees  at  promotion  boards  has changed,  one should still consider completing  any  career milestones like this at the earliest opportunity in case the policy changes. AOP Officers (and their Flight Commander/mentor/supervisor)  should  time/plan  AAD  opportunities  carefully  with  promotion schedules; some opportunities may make an individual less competitive at O-5 and O-6 boards. Current trends show an individual to be less competitive at the O-5 board if the individual is in an in-residence Master’s Degree or PhD program 1 year Below the Primary Zone (BPZ) or In the Primary Zone (IPZ). Therefore, it is not recommended for individuals to be enrolled in in-residence AAD program during that time period of their careers. When applying for in-residence AAD opportunities, officers should be mindful of the perception of being in school too long, especially while in the zone for promotion. For AOP officers, there are essentially two options to obtain an AAD: 1) obtain the AAD through one of many off-duty education programs; or 2) attend a full-time education program offered through the AFIT AAD Program. Funding for the AFIT AAD Program is available either through the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS). 1.3.6.2.1. Off-Duty Education. Off-duty education is the best option for a member who desires to complete  an  AAD  early  in  his/her  career.  Tuition  assistance  (TA)  is  available  through  the  Base Education Office if a member elects to obtain an AAD using this option. Be aware that using TA generates an active duty service commitment (ADSC). 1.3.6.2.2. AFIT AAD. Acceptance into an AFIT AAD program is extremely competitive. Program availability varies from year-to-year due to AFMS funding and other requirements. Through this option,  members  can  obtain  Master’s  degrees  through  AFIT-sponsored  education.  Detailed information  related  to  AFIT  AAD  opportunities  can  be  obtained  on  the  AFMS  Knowledge Exchange (Kx) BSC Education Branch website at https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx3/AFBSCEducation/Pages/home.aspx.  1.3.6.2.3.  Air  University  AAD.  A  virtually  no-cost  (some  books  may  need  to  be  purchased  by enrollees) opportunity for AOP officers to obtain an AAD is to complete Air University’s Online Distance Learning Course. Active Duty USAF Captains who have Total Active Federal Commission Service of 6 or more years, completed SOS, and do not have a master's degree may enroll into the Leadership  Concentration  component.  Successful  completion  of  this  33-semester-hour  program yields an accredited Master’s Degree in Military Operational Art and Science, which is the same degree that individuals who complete in-residence ACSC earn. Additionally, eligible  O-4 selects who currently do not possess both IDE credit and a Master’s Degree, may enroll in a combined 12  program, in which successful completion yields Joint-PME credit, IDE credit, and the same Master’s Degree in Military Operational Art and Science. This combined program consists of eleven 8-week courses.  More  information  on  AU’s  online  Master’s  Degree  programs  can  be  found  at http://acsc.maxwell.af.mil/masters.aspx.  1.3.6.2.4.  Fellowships.  Fellowships  are  designed  to  develop  leadership  and  broaden  perspectives through observation and interaction with senior DoD, legislative, political, and academic leaders making  strategy  and  policy  decisions.  In  accordance  with  (IAW)  AFI  36-2301,  Developmental Education, officers who have attended, are currently attending, or who have been selected to attend programs  where  they  were  competitively  selected  by  the  AF,  may  be  considered  for  IDE/SDE equivalency credit. For BSC officers, those programs are limited to fellowships that are part of either the AFMS Advanced Development Program or AFMS Executive Development Program. Notice of upcoming  fellowship  opportunities  are  posted  on  the  AFMS  Knowledge  Exchange  (Kx)  BSC Education  Branch  website  at  https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx3/AFBSCEducation/Pages/home.aspx.  Fellowships on this listing that are eligible for IDE/SDE equivalency credit are denoted as being open to ‘Any BSC’ officer. Fellowships that are restricted to a subset of BSC officers are not eligible. 1.3.6.3. Intermediate Executive Skills (IES) Course. The IES course is targeted for field grade officers (Maj/Lt Col) and senior enlisted members (SMSgt/CMSgt) who are selected as healthcare executive team  members  at  the  SGA,  SGB,  SGD,  SGH,  SGN,  SGP,  Squadron  Commander  and  Group Superintendent-level. It is intended to bridge the gap between initial management training and advanced leadership training received prior to command. The course consists of morning core curriculum lectures and afternoon breakout sessions targeting corps-specific requirements. Distance learning modules and presentations  focus  on  the  executive  skills  core  competencies  in  the  areas  of  Military  Medical, Leadership  and  Organizational  Management,  Health  Law  and  Policy,  Health  Resources  Allocation, Ethics in the Health Care Environment, Individual and Organizational Behavior, Clinical Understanding, and Performance Measurement and Improvement. 13   1.4. Section C - Proficiency Training Requirements 1.4.1.  Purpose.  Proficiency  training  requirements  in  this  career  field  are  defined  in  terms  of  task, knowledge, and experience requirements. This section outlines the specialty qualification requirements for entry  and  award  of  each  AFS  level.  The  specific  task  and  knowledge  requirements  are  identified  in Attachment 3 of this CFETP. 1.4.2. Specialty Qualifications.  1.4.2.1. 43AX Specialty Qualifications.  1.4.2.1.1. Knowledge. Thorough understanding of aerospace physiology and closely related subjects is mandatory.   1.4.2.1.2. Education. Bachelor’s or Post-Graduate Degree in physiology, human factors, or related fields  (e.g.  engineering  psychology,  biomedical  engineering,  exercise  physiology,  kinesiology, human systems integration, or HF) is mandatory. In addition to a well-established background in physiology  or  HF,  completion  of  courses  in  the  areas  of  chemistry,  physics,  statistics,  organic chemistry,  biochemistry,  comparative  anatomy,  and  computer  science  is  highly  desirable.  Post-graduate  degree  applicants  are  preferred;  however,  exceptionally  qualified  applicants  (e.g.  have significant military aviation experience) who have completed a bachelor’s degree in the areas of study listed above will be considered. Applicants must have a GPA of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale.   1.4.2.1.3. Training and experience. For entry into AFSC 43A1, experience as an instructor or teacher is  desirable.    To  perform  basic  duties  of  AFSC  43A1,  completion  of  the  AOPO  101  course (B3OBY43A1 0A1C) is mandatory.  For award of AFSC 43A3, completion of 201 and 202 phase requirements  (listed  in  Attachment  3)  and  experience  requirements  (listed  in  Table  2.1.)  are mandatory.   1.4.2.1.4. For entry into this specialty, an interview with a designated senior aerospace physiologist is required.  Strong personal endorsements in areas of initiative and teamwork are highly desirable. 1.4.2.1.5. For entry, award, and retention of AFSCs 43AX, physical qualification IAW AFI 48-123 Flying Class III requirements is mandatory. 1.5. Section D - Resource Constraints 1.5.1.  Purpose.  This  section  identifies  known  resource  constraints  that  preclude  optimal  and  desired education  and  training  from  being  developed  or  conducted,  including  information  such  as  cost  and manpower. Narrative explanations of each resource constraint and an impact statement describing what effect each constraint has on training are included. Also included in this section are actions required, office of  primary  responsibility,  and  target  completion  dates.  Resource  constraints  will  be,  as  a  minimum, reviewed and updated annually.  1.5.2. Training. 1.5.2.1.  Entry  Level  Training  –  AOPO  101  Course  (In-Residence).  The  AOPO  101  Course (B3OBY43A1 0A1C) provides the knowledge and skills to perform basic duties as an Aerospace and Operational Physiologist.  Course material includes:  Principles of aerospace physiology, science of the earth’s atmosphere, introduction to operational human factor issues in AF aviation, and familiarization with mishap investigation techniques.  Students are familiarized with devices used when conducting aerospace physiology training to include the unaided night vision trainer, night vision goggles, Barany chair, and applicable  aircrew  life  support  equipment.    Students are  familiarized  with  the forms  and publications  used  in  the  administration  of  the  AF  Aerospace  Physiological  Training  Program  and participate  in  hypobaric  chamber,  centrifuge,  and  spatial  disorientation  training.    Students  receive instruction on hypobaric chamber systems and crew positions, and are familiarized with basic flight 14  principles  and  apply  these  principles  during  simulated  flight.  Students  receive  instruction  on communicative skills and instructor methodology and are familiarized with the academic lessons that they will teach IAW AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program. 1.5.2.1.1. Constraints. There are no resource constraints at this time. 1.5.2.1.1.1. Impact. The AOPO 101 course is the initial skills training course for the 43AX AFS. Periodic updates and modifications are required to stay current with changing AFMS objectives and mission requirements, and the equipment used to meet these requirements. 1.5.2.1.1.2. Resources required. There are no resource requests at this time that require a Course Resource Estimate (CRE).    1.5.2.1.1.3. Action required. None. 1.5.2.1.2. OPR and target completion date. USAFSAM/FEP is the OPR for course development and will continue to maintain the course.  The course is currently complete. 1.5.2.2. Upgrade Training – AOPO 201 and 202 Phases. Upgrade training is mandatory training that leads to the attainment of the qualified level (43A3) AFSC. For award of AFSC 43A3, completion of AOPO 201 and 202 phase requirements (listed in Attachment 3) and specific levels of experience in AOP activities (see Table 2.1.) is mandatory. It is the responsibility of Flight Commanders and AOP Program  Managers  to  ensure  that  core  43A  upgrade  training  and  assignment-specific  training  is accomplished. Although the goal is for 43A officers in upgrade training to complete all AOPO 201 phase requirements  NLT  15  months  after  completion  of  the  AOPO  101  course  and  all  AOPO  202  phase requirements during months 16-30 after completing the AOPO 101 course, these requirements may be completed at any time during the 30 months following completion of the AOPO 101 course (based on TDY/funding availability, manning constraints, etc.). An example timeline for 43A upgrade training is listed in Attachment 7. AOP Program Managers will request a waiver from the Associate Corps Chief if circumstances prevent an officer from completing AOPO 201 and 202 requirements within the 30-month timeframe.  1.5.2.2.1. Constraints. None. 1.5.2.2.1.1. Impact. Upgrade training in the 43AX AFS allows for continued development of the skills  required  of  Aerospace  and  Operational  Physiology  officers.  Exposure  to  standardized education, training, and experiences required for upgrade ensures that AOP officers have similar levels of expertise in concepts that are core/essential to the 43A3 AFS.     1.5.2.2.1.2. Resources required. A CRE is not required to fulfill resource requests for this training. 1.5.2.2.1.3. Action Required. None.  1.5.2.2.2. OPR and Target Completion Date.  Biomedical Sciences Corps (BSC) Associate Corps Chief (43AX), AFMSA/SG3PT, AETC/A3FM, and USAFSAM/FEP are the OPRs for developing upgrade training requirements and materials. Educational materials and associated instructions used to support CFETP items during the AOPO 201 and 202 phases of upgrade training (where indicated) will be available NLT 15 Sep 2016.    1.5.2.3. Obtaining In-Residence Course Training Quotas. Supervisors of AOP officers in upgrade training should contact their Unit Training Manager (UTM) for information on obtaining quotas for in-residence courses required for upgrade training (or any other in-residence/formal course). 15                                                         THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK                 16 Part II 2.1. Section A – Course Training Standard (CTS) 2.1.1. Purpose. The CTS is a essentially a contract between the BSC Associate Corps Chief (43AX) and the training provider and can only be modified through BSC Associate Corps Chief’s policy directives and/or the annual CFETP review/update and U&TW processes.  The CTS describes course/training content and  the  standard  of  proficiency  (where  applicable)  each  officer  is  expected  to  achieve  in  order  to successfully complete an in-residence course or an OJT activity. 2.1.2. Documentation of In-Residence Training. In-residence courses provide students with graduation certificates that indicate that the student has satisfactorily completed all respective course requirements (see Attachment 3 for formal course lessons and activities), thus, supervisor documentation of completion of knowledge and task items that are included in an in-residence course is not required.  Copies of in-residence course graduation certificates will be kept with the officer’s CFETP. 2.1.3. Documentation of OJT. AOP Flight Commanders will ensure that OJT-based upgrade training is documented in Attachments 3 and 4. As a minimum, complete the following columns in Attachments 3 and 4:  Training  Start  Date,  Training  Complete  Date,  Trainee’s  Initials,  and  Trainer’s  Initials.    For identification purposes, the printed name/initials of trainees, trainers, and certifiers should be recorded in Table A2.2. of Attachment 2.  In the future, documentation may transition to a web-based information management system such as the Air Force Training Records (AFTR) program. 2.1.3.1.  Trainer  Responsibilities.  The  trainer/supervisor/Flight  Commander  may  be  the  same individual.  If necessary, the Flight Commander (or AOP Program Manager) may assign someone else as trainer.  Trainers should be selected based on their experience and ability to provide instruction to  trainees.    The  trainer  will  document  start  and  completion  dates  for  each  OJT  item  listed  in Attachments 3 and 4.  The trainer and trainee will confirm training start and completion dates before the trainer records the training start/complete dates in the CFETP.  The trainer and trainee will enter their initials in the appropriate column after training is complete. The trainer is responsible for using AF QTPs and other prescribed evaluation criteria (where applicable) to conduct evaluations.  If no evaluation  criteria  is  listed  for  a  knowledge  or  task  item  (sat/unsat  item),  trainers  will  use  their judgement to discern when training is complete.  2.1.3.2. Certifier Responsibilities. Certifiers will provide third-party validation on training items (when  identified  in  the  STS).    Flight  Commanders  (or  AOP  Program  Managers)  may  select individual(s) at the unit level to serve as task certifier.  The certifier must be someone other than the trainer, and will conduct an evaluation of the trainee (in-person or remotely using computer/video media) using AF QTPs (where applicable) and/or other prescribed evaluation criteria.  The trainee is not qualified to perform tasks that require certification until the certifier enters their initials in the appropriate column. 2.1.3.3.  Trainee  Responsibilities.  The  trainee  must  actively  participate  in  all  opportunities  for upgrade and qualification training and request assistance from their supervisor and/or trainer when having difficulty with any part of training.  2.1.3.4. The AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation, may be used to document any officer training not included in this CFETP.  If used, AF Form 797s will be kept with the CFETP. 2.1.4. Qualitative Requirements.  Standardized proficiency codes may be used to describe the level of expertise (knowledge or performance based) required for applicable STS line items. See Attachment 2 for the Training Proficiency Code Key.   17 2.1.5.  Proficiency  Designator  Table.  Table  2.1.  identifies  the  education,  training,  and  experience requirements necessary to attain each 43A AFS skill level.    Table 2.1.

Completion of one year supervisory experience.4  Same as 43A3 Staff Level1 Same as 43A3 43A4 1 Designation of staff level relates only to the level of functional responsibility and is restricted to positions above wing level.  It does not denote additional specialty qualification. 2 Count only instruction hours conducted with live students after the officer has been qualified to teach the lesson.  Prior-enlisted teaching hours will not be counted. 3 Prior-enlisted chamber experience as inside observer may be counted. 4 Supervisory experience = rating/writing performance reports, performing feedbacks, etc. on enlisted/officer/civilian personnel. Prior enlisted supervisory time will not be counted.  2.1.6.  Waiver  Authority.    Unless  specified  otherwise,  waiver  requests  to  the  education,  training,  and experience  requirements  during  the  AOPO  201  and  202  training  phases  (upgrade  training)  must  be submitted to BSC Associate Corps Chief (43A) by the respective MAJCOM AOP Program Manager. 2.1.7. Recommendations.  Report perceived shortcomings in education and training content and notices of CFETP errors and recommended corrective actions to the USAFSAM Aerospace Physiology Education Branch at usafsam.fepe.43A@us.af.mil.  Input from the field will be compiled for inclusion in the annual CFETP review/improvement process.     18  2.2. Section B – Training Course Index 2.2.1. Training Course Index.

Section C – Support Materials 2.3.1. Support materials enhance unit-level OJT and help standardize the program across the Air Force. As new AOP OJT support materials are developed and released (or any new information regarding the 43AX CFETP  is  released),  notice  will  be  posted  in  the  “AOP  News”  tab  of  the  Aerospace  and  Operational Physiology website section of the AFMS Knowledge Exchange. Posts to this site by AOP leadership will disseminate a notification message via email to 43A officers in the field.  Wright-Patterson AFB, OHRandolph AFB, TXWright-Patterson AFB, OHRandolph AFB, TXNVGAIC2.3.1.1.  AF  Qualification  Training  Package  (AFQTP).  The  AFQTP  is  an  instructional  package designed for use at the unit to qualify (or aid qualification), in a duty position, program, or on a piece of equipment.  It may be printed, computer-based, or in other audiovisual media (reference AFI 36-2201, Air  Force  Training  Program).  Established  to  provide  standardized  OJT  Program  qualification  and certification  standards,  AFQTPs  are  mandatory  for  use  during  UGT  and  OJT  certification  (when required). When indicated in the “Certification for OJT” section of the STS, AFQTPs will be referenced and  used  to  fulfill  43AX  officer  upgrade  training  requirements.  AFQTPs  are  accessible  in  the  AF              e-Publications Site at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/ and can be found by typing ‘QTP’ in the ‘Search Products’ window.  Specific guidance on the use of AFQTPs for AOP officer UGT will be released when the development process for these materials is finalized.   2.4. Section D – MAJCOM Unique Requirements 2.4.1. There are currently no MAJCOM unique requirements; however, there are unique education and training requirements that are specific to an AOP assignment.  These requirements are listed in Attachment 4.    19 GLOSSARY OF REFERENCES AND SUPPORTING INFORMATION Attachment 1   Abbreviations and Acronyms AD – Active Duty ADRAC – Altitude Decompression Sickness Risk Assessment Computer ADP – Airmen Development Plan AF – Air Force AFE – Aircrew Flight Equipment AFI – Air Force Instruction AFMS – Air Force Medical Service AFOCD – Air Force Officer Classification Directory AFPC – Air Force Personnel Center AFPD – Air Force Policy Directive AFRL – Air Force Research Laboratory AFQTP – Air Force Qualification Training Package AFRL – Air Force Research Laboratory AFS – Air Force Specialty AFSC – Air Force Specialty Code AFTR – Air Force Training Record AGSM – Anti G-Force Straining Maneuver AMIC – Aircraft Mishap Investigation Course AMIP – Aircraft Mishap and Investigation Prevention Course ANG – Air National Guard AOP – Aerospace & Operational Physiology AOPO – Aerospace & Operational Physiology Officer AOPTT – Aerospace & Operational Physiology Training Team AOPTU – Aerospace & Operational Physiology Training Unit BSC – Biomedical Service Corps CC – Commander CCAF – Community College of the Air Force CFETP – Career Field Education and Training Plan COT – Commissioned Officer Training CRE – Course Resource Estimate  20 DE – Developmental Education DCS – Decompression Sickness DoD – Department of Defense DoDI – Department of Defense Instruction EMS – Emergency Management System ETCA – Education & Training Course Announcement FASTTM – Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool GLOC – G-Force Induced Loss of Consciousness HAAMS – High-Altitude Airdrop Mission Support HARMS – High-Altitude Reconnaissance Mission Support HF – Human Factors HFACS – Human Factors Analysis Classification System HFT – Hypoxia Familiarization Trainer HSI – Human Systems Integration IAW – In Accordance With IPT – Integrated Physiological Trainer ISR – Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance MAJCOM – Major Command MDS – Mission, Design, Series OJT – On-the-Job Training PCS – Permanent Change of Station PM – Program Manager ROBD – Reduced Oxygen Breathing Device RPA – Remotely Piloted Aircraft STS – Specialty Training Standard TDY – Temporary Duty UFT – Undergraduate Flying Training CSO – Combat Systems Officer UGT – Upgrade Training UMD – Unit Manning Document USAFA– United States Air Force Academy USAFSAM – United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine UTM – Unit Training Manager U&TW – Utilization & Training Workshop  21 Key Terms Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS).

Aerospace  &  Operational  Physiology  History.    Source:  USAF  Aerospace  Physiology:  An Organizational History, by Yvonne Brandt, Lt Col, USAFR, BSC. A6.1.1. AOP Career Field Origins. While we generally consider aviation physiology to have begun its evolution with the beginning of flight, the first research related to pressure change is traced back to a much earlier time. Several hundred years before the Wright Brothers, in the 1600s, a German scholar named Otto von Guerick invented the world’s first air pump in 1650. Guerick’s vacuum experiments significantly contributed to the understanding of high altitude physiology. Twenty years later in  England, in  1671, Robert  Hooke  invented a vacuum  pump  and  the  world’s first  altitude chamber. Interestingly, Hooke was an assistant researcher for Robert Boyle. Yes, the same Boyle of Boyle’s Law. Hooke’s work was remarkable for its time and it would be two more centuries before Paul Bert (1830-1886) completed his work on high altitude physiology and decompression sickness. Paul Bert’s work with the effect of hyperbaric and hypobaric environments on man were of major importance during WWII and was a starting point for research for the effect of the low pressure environment on astronauts. A6.1.2. In 1904 the Wright Brothers flew their first flight over five minutes in an airplane made of wood and fabric. From that first flight in 1904 to 1917, airspeeds increased from 6.8 mph to 126 mph and altitudes rose from just a few feet off the ground at Kitty Hawk to 20,000 ft. From 1914-1917, the world’s militaries saw the value of the new flying machine. During WWI, when the ground troops were  trapped  in  the  trenches,  the  only  branch  with  any  freedom  of  movement  was  the  flying squadrons  of  the  European  powers.  The  main  role  of  the  airplane  was  reconnaissance  and  was beginning to replace the Zeppelin and the observation balloon. Initially, while on a reconnaissance mission, pilots from rivaling nations would wave to each other. As the war progressed, however, a friendly wave turned into aerial duels. By 1914, parachutes were being used in balloons but not in aircraft possibly because of the excess weight. If a pilot crashed and survived, they were expected to jump up nonchalantly to show they were undaunted by the perils of flight. A6.1.3. The mishap rate of the first year was abysmal with the British discovering that out of 100 killed, only two were shot down and eight were due to mechanical problems. The remaining 90 were a direct result of human factors. Consequently, considerable thought was put into human performance and aviation. The end result was the beginning of aerospace medicine. A6.1.4. In 1916, U.S. involvement in WWI was looking unavoidable.  The U.S. war department issued special order No. 243 to the authority on aviation in the office of the Army Surgeon who was General Major Theodore Lyster, M.D. (first Chief surgeon of the Army’s aviation section, known as father  of  American  Aviation  Medicine).  General  Lyster  was  directed  to  “…take  whatever  steps needed to establish the practice of aviation medicine”. General Lyster recruited Dr. William Holland Wilmer and Dr. Isaac Jones to design a screening program for aviators and eventually to set up semi-independent medical service. In 1917, they established a lab at Hazlehurst field, outside Mineola, Long  Island.  Maj.  Edward  C.  Schneider,  Ph.D.,  who  is  acknowledged  as  the  first  aviation physiologist, was the physiology department chair. He would lecture Army Air Corps Flying Officers on the hazards of flight and would augment the training with the low-pressure chamber to demonstrate the effects of altitude and the Barany chair to demonstrate the physiology of the inner ear. Aircrew education and training on the human factors of flight continues to this day, and is conducted by the 43AX Air Force Specialty.    A6.1.5.

The BSC badge, a medical caduceus with an “S” superimposed, symbolizes the application of science to the medical profession. Eligibility criteria for award and wear of Air Force (AF) occupational badges can be found in AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel.  A6.2.1. Basic Badge. The basic badge is awarded upon successful completion of technical school or after attaining fully qualified AFSC when technical school is not available. A6.2.2. Senior Badge. The senior badge adds a star to the top of the badge. Wear the senior badge after 7 years in the career field.  A6.2.3. Master Badge. The master badge indicates the final step in the occupational series. Wear the master badge after 15 years in the career field.  A6.2.4. Constructive Credit. Medical Service officers’ time in specialty will include any constructive credit awarded at the time of appointment.  A6.2.5. Prior Enlisted Officers. When serving as an officer in the same career field as when enlisted, count both time in the enlisted and officer career fields to determine the earned badge level.  A6.3. AOP Officer Accession Programs. Many officer accession programs exist for entrance into the 43AX AFS. The list below is not all-inclusive, however, this listing could be considered for use by current AOP officers for recruitment and mentoring purposes (e.g., enlisted-to-officer, civilian accessions, etc.). A6.3.1. U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA). USAFA is a military academy for officer candidates for the U.S. Air Force. Graduates of the Academy’s four-year program receive a Bachelor of Science degree, and are commissioned as Second Lieutenants. The program at USAFA is based on the four pillars of military training, academics, athletics, and character development. In addition to a rigorous military training regimen, cadets also take a broad academic course load with an extensive core curriculum in engineering, humanities, social sciences, basic sciences, military studies, and physical education. An Academy education is valued at more than $416,000, yet is offered at no cost to cadets. More information can be found at http://www.usafa.af.mil/ or http://www.academyadmissions.com/.   A6.3.2.  Air  Force  Reserve  Officers’  Training  Corps  (AFROTC).  AFROTC  is  a  college-based program for training commissioned officers of the U.S .Air Force. AFROTC students attend college like other students, but also receive basic military training and officer training through the AFROTC unit at or nearby the college. A variety of full and partial AFROTC scholarships provide for an attractive way to  relieve  the  financial  burden  of  college  education.  More  information  can  be  found  at https://www.afrotc.com/.   A6.3.3. Commissioned Officer Training (COT). COT is a 4.5 week program that provides initial officership training for Air Force judge advocates, chaplains, health professions officers, and medical scholarship recipients. COT conducts training for Air Force active duty, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve officers. This training is provided to qualified officers after commissioning.  A6.3.4. 4M0-to-43A. Enlisted members of the AOP career field (4M071) may be eligible to become AOP officers if they meet the requirements outlined in the AFOCD. Interested members should direct their questions through their chain of command to either the 43A BSC Associate Corps Chief or the 4M0X1 Air Force Career Field Manager.      63 A6.4. Leadership.   A6.4.1. Leadership is an inherent responsibility of every military officer. Over the ages many great military leaders have displayed their unique talents both on and off the battlefields. All great leaders seem to understand and possess certain core values (or principles), which help them navigate through the tough times of leadership. These principles include honesty, integrity, commitment, enthusiastic energy, humility, faith, and vision.  A6.4.2. Leadership in the Air Force begins with understanding and living our core values every day. The Air Force core values of: Integrity first; Service before self; and Excellence in all we do, help us to continue being the absolute best at what we do. Former Secretary of the Air Force, Dr. Sheila Widnall, summed up core values like this:  “Core values make the military what it is; without them, we cannot succeed. They are the values that instill confidence, earn lasting respect, and create willing followers. They are the values that anchor resolve in the most difficult situations. They are the values that buttress mental and physical courage when we enter combat. In essence, they are the three pillars of professionalism that provide the foundation for military leadership at every level.”  A6.4.3.  One  great  example  of  what it  takes  to  be  an  effective  leader  can  be  found  in  these  words,            “BE A LEADER”:  A6.4.3.1. B – BE BETTER than those you have admired and respected. The best way to pay back those who have helped mentor your growth is to be better than even they hoped you would be.  A6.4.3.2. E – EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED – You’ve been promoted because of your proven potential to take on more responsibility. This brings with it a lot of unforeseen, unexpected terrain. Be ready to take on whatever comes your way head on. A true leader can afford to get surprised, but he/she can’t afford to let surprise trip him/her up!  A6.4.3.3. A – ACCOUNTABILITY – You will fly lead more than ever now, take the heat for your mistakes and those of your team. Give your team all the credit you can and always provide top cover for your troops – even when it hurts.  A6.4.3.4.  L  –  LEARN/LOVE/LOOK  AHEAD  –  Learn  every  day  –  it’s  the  key  to  not  only continuously improving, but also to sustaining yourself as the best of the best (which is what those who follow you will expect/hope for). Love your family and your troops – always keep your priorities here in clear focus; never neglect either one. Look Ahead – if you don’t, you will be blind and worse yet, your troops will be too.  A6.4.3.5. E – EXPERT – Never assume you are one; always strive to be one. Be prepared for others to automatically expect you are one by virtue of your rank/position.  A6.4.3.6. A – ATTITUDE & ACCUMEN – There is no substitute for a sustained positive, proactive, and professional attitude – especially when you must lead something you don’t particularly agree with. There is also no substitute for looking and acting like an all-pro at all times.  A6.4.3.7. D – DOER – If you are not leading by doing, by example, then you’re not leading. Never ask/task others to do anything you would not do yourself. Always consider this before you levy the task.  A6.4.3.8. E – EXCELLENCE is largely a function of mission success and what the people you serve with think about you and your leadership; it’s never easy to do well in both arenas consistently, but that’s what you must always strive for.  A6.4.3.9. R – RESPECT is for those that have earned it, not for those who demand it.   64 A6.4.4.  Mentorship.  Mentorship is a  critical  component of the  AF's  Force  Development  construct.  Mentorship is normally a relationship in which a person with greater experience and wisdom guides another person to develop both personally and professionally and is designed to prepare Airmen for increased responsibilities. Reference AFMAN 36-2643, Air Force Mentoring Program, for additional guidance on mentoring in the Air Force. A6.4.4.1. Mentoring Benefits: There are several benefits to a mentoring relationship, to include receiving further professional career development, enhancing capacity to translate core values and strategies  into  productive  actions,  and  increasing  mastery  of  the  institutional  and  occupational competencies.    Officers  are  encouraged  to  engage  in  building  and  maintaining  a  productive relationship  with  a  mentor.  A  logical  choice  for  a  mentor  is  a  supervisor.  While  the  immediate supervisor should be a logical choice for a professional mentor, they may not always be the best one. Should the immediate supervisor not be a good fit, Airmen might instead look for a professional mentor a couple of levels higher up the career ladder. This person may be an AOP officer, enlisted, or civilian, or work in a completely different AFSC.   A6.4.5.  Feedback.  The  officer,  enlisted,  and  civilian  promotion  systems  require  formal  feedback sessions.  Initial  feedback  to  your  subordinate  establishes  your  expectations  for  their  performance. Follow-on  feedback  sessions  allow  you  to  communicate  to  the  subordinate  just  how  well  they  are meeting your expectations. Just as importantly, the informal feedback you give your subordinates will enhance communication and help improve job performance.  A6.5. Supervision. Initial training for all newly assigned supervisors helps bridge the gap between the skills required at the working level and those required at the supervisory level. Before first-level supervisors assume their new duties, or within six months after assignment to a supervisory position, they will be provided the initial training described below. A6.5.1. U.S. Air Force Supervisor’s Course (USAF SC). This course is designed to provide first-level supervisors, regardless of organizational component, with leadership and management skills required in supervisory positions. While most students are civil service, military supervisors who haven’t obtained equivalency training through PME or through the waiver options should enroll. Experienced supervisors (3 or more years documented supervision) should consider enrolling in the Advanced USAF SC. To register,  visit the  Air  University  Portal  at https://auportal.maxwell.af.mil/auportal/welcome.AirUniversity.  Contact  your  local  FSS  for  more information on available training for supervisors. A6.5.2. Supervising Officers.  the  PPDS  Virtual  Campus, located  at A6.5.2.1. Officer Evaluation System (OES). AFI 36-2611, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems, discusses  the  OES.  This  document  includes  information  on  the  objective  of  the  program, documenting job performance as well as dealing with Promotion Recommendation Forms (PRFs).  A6.5.2.2.  Officer  Promotion  System  (OPS).  AFI  36-2501,  Officer  Promotions  and  Selective Continuation, describes the purpose and details of the OPS. Detailed information on such things as promotion opportunities, phase points, selection criteria, and selection boards are included. AFPAM 36-2506, You and Your Promotions – The Air Force Officer Promotion Program, contains additional information on officer promotion as well as selective continuation. Talk with your supervisor and commander on the details of the OPS. Promotion board schedules are also available on the myPers web page at https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/home.     65  A6.5.3. Supervising Enlisted.  A6.5.3.1. The Enlisted Force Structure. AFI 36-2618, The Enlisted Force Structure, defines the enlisted  force  structure  and  implements  AFPD  36-26,  Total  Force  Development.  It  establishes leadership and development levels, responsibilities, and official terms of address for enlisted Airmen. It describes special senior noncommissioned officer positions and standardizes duty titles.  A6.5.3.2.  Enlisted  Evaluation  System  (EES).  AFI  36-2406,  Officer  and  Enlisted  Evaluation Systems, is the governing document for the EES. It includes information on such areas as performance feedback, enlisted performance reports, as well as other pertinent information.  A6.5.3.3.  Airman  Promotion  Program.  AFI  36-2502,  Airman  Promotion/Demotion  Programs, covers the airman promotion program. It contains information on promotions from Amn through CMSgt.  A6.5.3.4. Enlisted Training. AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, covers the management and development of enlisted training.  A6.5.4. Supervising Civilians.  A6.5.4.1. You may be required to supervise civilians at some point in your AOP career. This is a unique leadership opportunity that requires specific knowledge and training. These areas include union agreements, civilian appraisals, time keeping, etc. You can locate the most current information on the civilian personnel system by contacting the Base Civilian Personnel Office.  A6.5.4.2.  Civilian  Performance  Program.  Refer  to  AFI  36-1001,  Managing  the  Civilian Performance  Program,  for  the  latest  information  on  how  to  manage  the  civilian  performance program.  This  instruction  includes  information  on  such  issues  as:  performance  planning  and appraisals,  incentive  awards,  monetary  incentive  awards,  time  off  incentive  awards,  honorary incentive awards, dealing with performance problems, as well as keeping records.  A6.5.4.3. Civilian Personnel Management Course (CPMC). CPMC is a federally-mandated course and is a requirement for all first-time supervisors of civilian employees.  Hosted by the Air Force Personnel Professional Development School (PPDS), the course is designed to provide military and civilian  first-level  supervisors  with  background  information  and  an  understanding  of  applicable personnel laws and regulations needed to effectively carry out their civilian personnel management responsibilities. To register, visit the PPDS Virtual Campus, located at the Air University Portal at https://auportal.maxwell.af.mil/auportal/welcome.AirUniversity.  A6.5.5.  Awards  and  Decorations.  One  of  the  most  important  responsibilities of  a  supervisor is  to properly recognize and reward subordinates for exceptional performance. AFI 36-2803, The Air Force Military Awards and Decorations Program, contains the latest information on the Air Force Awards and Decorations Program.  Examples of award programs are listed below:  A6.5.5.1. Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) Awards Program. The AFMS Awards Program is an  annual  program  designed  to  recognize  and  reward  outstanding  performance  in  a  number  of different categories.  Refer to AFI 36-2856, Medical Service Awards for details. A6.5.5.2. Squadron/Wing Recognition Programs. Local recognition programs vary from base-to-base. Contact your first sergeant or squadron section commander for a full listing of recognition programs available.  A6.5.5.3. AF Safety Awards Program. The AF Safety Awards Program recognizes outstanding safety acts and achievements. Refer to AFI 36-2833, Safety Awards for details. A6.5.5.4. Civilian Awards. Civilian awards vary by location as well. Contact your civilian personnel office for local information. 66  A6.6.  Promotion  Guidance.  Officer  promotion  is  based  on  the  whole  person  concept.  Demonstrated expertise and performance within and outside the AOP career field is considered at the time of promotion. An individual’s assignment history should show increasing responsibility and clearly demonstrate examples of applied leadership. The AOP officer must take control of his/her career – do not leave it up to chance. A6.6.1. PME. Generally “how” Developmental Education (DE) is completed (e.g., by correspondence, seminar, or in-residence) is not as important as getting it completed and doing it is early as possible. All things  being  equal,  in-residence  DE  attendance  may  add  some  weight  because  of  the  competitive selection process for in-residence attendance. AOP officers should enroll and complete DE as soon as eligible, which is as soon as you receive notification (line number) of promotion to the next rank (i.e. you  can  enroll  in  ACSC  via  correspondence  as  a  Captain  with  a  line  number  to  Major).  Distance learning PME programs can be found at the Air University website: http://www.au.af.mil/au/spaatz/schools.aspx. Additionally, consider that performing sister-service PME (e.g. Marine Corps Command and  Staff  College  by  correspondence)  will  heighten  your  professional  knowledge  and  may  provide advantage at competitive selection boards. A6.6.2. AF Form 707, Officer Performance Report (OPR). Performance reports are the bread and butter of a career and the key documents behind: medal considerations, promotions, AFIT selection, specialized  training  assignments  and  special  duty  selection.  A  well-written  OPR  should  paint  a quantitative and qualitative picture assessing the officer’s performance. It is vital for an OPR to contain stratification statements. Stratification shows how a member ranks against peers within an organization. A  stratification  statement  sends  a  message  from  leadership  to  the  promotion  board  regarding  the member‘s  readiness  for  promotion.  Absence  or  strength  of  impact  in  a  stratification  statement  will significantly affect the OPR (and PRF when the time comes). One of the most often asked questions is, ‘Should I write my own OPR?’ The answer is no. However, given that it is the most important document to career progression, it is strongly recommended that you involve yourself in the writing process by submitting bullets and accomplishments to your supervisor early. Many times, this is accomplished via a draft OPR authored by the member. For more tips on OPRs, refer to Table A6.1 below. A6.6.2.1. Awards, Decorations and Recognition. Quarterly and annual awards are important and should  always  be  highlighted  in  an  OPR.  Awards  are  an  important  discriminator  and  impact stratification  within  an  organization.  Awards  may  seem  insignificant  early  on,  but  they  become extremely important in supporting OPR stratification statements that end up on the PRF. Other forms of  recognition  such  as  Distinguished  Graduate,  Honor  Graduate,  etc.  during  formal  courses  also become useful discriminators on OPRs that can be used for stratifications. Military decorations are also important for promotion. Promotion boards may consider the receipt of a decoration after each assignment as an important factor. Boards may also consider the order in which the decorations are received as an indicator of career progression (e.g., receiving a Commendation medal after already receiving Meritorious Service Medal may be detrimental to your career). Table A6.1. Tips on OPRs      Throughout the performance period you should be collecting key accomplishments and outcomes and crafting bullets. This will do two things: 1) it helps you become a better mentor/supervisor in the future when you have to write OPRs and advise others and; 2) it provides key input to your supervisor in case they may not know the full impact of your contributions and accomplishments. If you are not disciplined in periodically capturing OPR input, a good habit is to keep most of your e-mail traffic over a rating period and review the subject/content. You will find most of what you need to construct meaningful input. You may be asking, ‘Should I put the bullets on the OPR form?’, and, ‘What if my supervisor does not ask me for input?’ Each is certainly at the discretion of the supervisor, but you should always be tracking your OPR due date and 60 to 45 days out have your input constructed in order to provide to your supervisor. It will be their choice if they use it.  67       The next thing you will want to do is get an up  to date OPR guide and local instructions for completing OPRs. Don’t get too hung up on the formatting (e.g., do I use a dot, dot, dot or dash – dash). As soon as you learn the style at one location you will move and the next unit will have a different style. What does not change is what should go into constructing bullets that jump off the page  at  the  reader.  Each  bullet  should  be  fact-based,  hard  hitting,  and  paint  a  picture  of accomplishment. The three parts to an effective bullet are: 1) Action (what was done); 2) Info (how it was accomplished); and 3) Impact (what was the result/significance). Avoid the use of flowery words and acronyms that may either affect the readability of a bullet or serve as a distraction to a review board.      Another area you should watch closely is what goes into the top and bottom lines in the rater and rater’s rater sections; especially the push statements. Make sure from year to year there is consistency especially  in  those  bottom  lines  that  show  continuous  growth  or  at  least  a  consistent  strong recommendation. For example let‘s say they push really hard for school and command one year and then just school the next year. Even if not intended, it might send the wrong message to a board reviewing your record. Bottom line…make sure you review the previous OPRs every time your OPR is due. Make sure the push lines on the most recent ones at least agree with previous ones if they don’t already make them stronger.      Finally, be aware of the importance of stratifications on you OPR. Stratifications are a quantitative comparison of an officer’s standing amongst other officers within a definable group and within a specific rater’s scope of authority. Stratifications are arguably the most important discriminator that can  be  used  on  an  OPR.  Stratifications  can  be  especially  useful  when  authoring  a  Promotion Recommendation  Form  (PRF).  Generally,  there  are  three  tiers  of  stratifications.    The  first  tier is stratification within your rank/peer group (e.g., 1/7 Captains, 2/12 CGOs). The next tier is amongst your vocation (e.g., 2/10 instructors). Finally, the third tier is an organizational stratification (e.g., 4/50 Wing CGOs). A superstar performer could have 3-4 stratifications on his/her OPR. Consult with your  organizational  leadership,  including  your  BSC  Executive  Officer,  about  the  importance  of stratifications in performance reports.  A6.6.3.  AF  Form  709,  Promotion  Recommendation  Form  (PRF).  The  PRF  is  the  single  most important  document  at  the  O-4,  O-5,  and  O-6  promotion  boards.  The  PRF  briefly  summarizes  an officer’s career and highlights to the promotion board why he/she should or should not be promoted. All the information included in the PRF is obtained from OPRs, decoration citations, and training reports. Additionally, officers who are prior enlisted or prior service in other branches of the military can use information from EPRs, or the equivalent. See AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems, for specific guidance on PRFs.  A6.6.3.1. Starting at the IPZ for O-4, PRFs will be accomplished for every promotion board. Along with your career brief, the PRF is the primary document the selection board reviews. Promotion boards do not have a great deal of time to thoroughly review each record, and may rely heavily on the PRF. AOP officers must make sure the PRF is very strong. If PCSing near an upcoming O-4 or O-5 promotion board, watch the timing closely. It is typically better to have the PRF written from the previous organization because a gaining commander may not stratify a new BSC officer above those currently working for him/her. This could mean the difference between a Definite Promote and a Promote  recommendation.  (This  statement  holds  true  for  OPRs  as  well.  Always  think  about stratification on OPRs.)  A6.6.3.2.  The  Senior  Rater  Signs  the  PRF.  The  Senior  Rater  will  make  a  promotion recommendation: Definite Promote (DP), Promote (P), or Do Not Promote. Strive for DP as this increases promotion percentages well above 90%. The Senior Rater (or Wing) will only have a small 68  number of DPs to give; the percentages change but it is about 1 per every 5 or 6 BSCs in the promotion zone. If the Senior Rater does not have enough officers meeting the board to qualify for a DP quota, a MAJCOM Management Level Review (MLR) is held to distribute the DPs. MLRs are held 90 days prior to the promotion board and members score records just like a promotion board.  A6.6.3.3. Mentoring. Officers should seek the advice of others when drafting a PRF. Drafts should be created at least 3-4 months prior to the due date. A member should draft their PRF, send it to a mentor  (e.g.,  senior  BSC officer), then edit  and send  to  another  mentor. This process  should be accomplished at least three times in order to formulate a good PRF. Also consider seeking the advice of a knowledgeable line officer who may be able to provide a different perspective. A6.6.4. Duty.  A6.6.4.1. Flight Command. The position of Flight Commander is a highly sought-after position in the  AOP  career  field. The  AOP  career  field  places  much  emphasis  on this  position since  it  is a prominent  leadership  position  at  an  operational-level  assignment.  Obtaining  and  succeeding  in  a Flight Commander role is a key discriminator for selection to Lt Col (O-5).  AOP officers should strive to become a Flight Commander at the first available opportunity to ensure that they complete this milestone in time. Also, experience as a Flight Commander is almost certainly a prerequisite to be competitive for a Squadron Command position.   A6.6.4.2. Timing and Promotion. If the timing of the first Flt/CC position is close to the member’s Lt Col board, the member should make every effort to arrive early enough to generate an OPR, or push for an out-of-cycle OPR so that a flight command OPR is on the top of the member’s record for the review board to see. A6.6.5. My Career Brief / Single Uniform Retrieval Function (SURF). A member’s ‘My Career Brief’ (i.e., SURF) is available through the AMS. Each member should verify accuracy of information in the SURF at least annually. If information is incorrect, make corrections through self-service functions in Virtual Military Personnel Flight (vMPF). Other corrections may require contacting the local Military Personnel Flight or Commander Support Staff.  A6.6.5.1. Duty Titles. Ensure that duty titles conform with guidance in Attachment 4 of the AFMS Flight Path located at https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx5/FlightPath/Pages/home.aspx. Duty titles that do not conform with this standard may be confusing to a promotion or reviewing board and, as a result, may not accurately reflect the level of responsibility associated with a certain position.   A6.7. Retirements / Separations. Hopefully your goal is to have a long and successful career that leads to a retirement at the time of your choosing and planning. However, that will not always be the case so make sure you give special attention to retirement and separation. Separation requires special attention and it goes without saying it should not be made without detailed thought and consideration. Don’t make the decision based on short-term conditions such as not liking your current job or not getting selected for an assignment. Certainly there is nothing wrong with separating when you have considered all the factors both personal and professional, but understand the impact if at a future date you decide that you want to return. Make sure you consult mentors and supervisors to help you identify some of the key factors; once the decision is made to separate, contact your BSC Executive Advisor for an exit interview. A6.7.1. Transition Assistance Program (TAP). The key to a successful transition to civilian life is career  readiness  planning,  which  requires  a  carefully  thought-out  Individual  Transition  Plan  (ITP) incorporated into the entire span of a service member’s career. The re-designed Transition Assistance Program (TAP) initiated by the Veterans Opportunity to Work (VOW) Act of 2011, and the Veterans Employment Initiative (VEI) requires that 4 mandates be completed by all Military Personnel prior to separation or retirement: 1) Pre-separation Counseling; 2) The TAP Goals, Plans, and Success (GPS) Workshop; 3) The Veterans Affairs (VA) Benefits Briefing; and 4) the Capstone activity. Elements of a 69  successful career ready ITP are depicted in Figure A6.1 below. Contact the local Airman & Family Readiness Center to schedule pre-separation counseling and to receive detailed information on other available at http://www.afpc.af.mil/lifeandcareer/transition.asp.   services.  More information transition can also be found Figure A6.1. Individual Transition Plan (ITP) Elements  A6.7.2. AF Reserve and Air National Guard (ANG). Both the AF Reserve and ANG provide opportunities for officers wishing to continue their military service beyond active duty.   A6.7.2.1. Air Force Reserve. Operating in various locations around the world, the Air Force Reserve has evolved from a "stand by" force for emergencies into a Major Command (MAJCOM) of the active duty Air Force. The Air Force Reserve currently performs about 20 percent of the work of the Air Force. Opportunities exist for prior service officers wanting to transition to the AF Reserve. For more information, visit https://afreserve.com/.  A6.7.2.2. Air National Guard. Serving part-time in the Air Guard, you’ll continue to receive the benefits of military service with the freedom to pursue a civilian career or continue your education. With more than 140 Air Guard units in the United States and its territories, you can serve where you live. Plus, you can choose from over 200 career options, so you can continue in your military specialty or re-train into a completely new field. Prior service officers can take advantage of various transition programs for entrance into the ANG.
