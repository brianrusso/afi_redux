CHRISTOPHER F. BURNE Lieutenant General, USAF The Judge Advocate General  DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES AIR FORCE WASHINGTON DC     Attachment: Guidance Memorandum               ATTACHMENT Guidance Memorandum  Replace Chapter 16 in its entirety with the following:  Chapter 16 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COURT REPORTER 16.1.  Generally.  The primary duty of the court reporter is to record verbatim all sessions of any proceeding to which he or she is assigned, to travel in support of any judicial and administrative proceedings, and to accurately transcribe and, with the coordination/assistance of the case trial paralegal, assemble Records of Trial; Article 32, Uniform Code of Military Justice; preliminary hearings; DuBay hearings; contingency confinement hearings; proceedings in revision; courts of inquiry;  and  other  proceedings  as  required.    The  Air  Force  Trial  Judiciary  Court  Reporter Manager is responsible for the centralized management and detailing of all court-reporting and transcription taskings. 16.2.  Definitions.  Court reporters are defined as follows:  16.2.1.  Civilian Court Reporters.  A civilian court reporter is an individual who has obtained sufficient knowledge, education, experience, or technical training as determined by the hiring base’s  civilian  personnel  office.    Civilian  court  reporters  are  directly  supervised  at  wing level,  but  may  be  assigned  travel  and  transcription  assignments  as  needed  when  their approved docketing calendar indicates they have time available.  16.2.2.    Enlisted  Court  Reporters.    An  enlisted  court  reporter  is  an  internal,  special  duty military paralegal that performs nearly the same duties as a civilian court reporter, but does so under the guidance and direction of the Air Force Trial Judiciary.  Enlisted court reporters are the primary court reporters to travel for courts and hearings.  Enlisted court reporters are centrally managed and supervised by the Air Force Trial Judiciary. 16.3.    Neutrality  of  the  Court  Reporter.    The  court  reporter  is  to  remain  neutral  in  any proceedings  to  which  assigned.    The  court  reporter  should  refrain  from  expressing  personal opinions about the case before, during, or after trial. Counsel should provide court reporters a list of  witnesses  and  a  list  of  exhibits  before  trial.    Court  reporters  must  not  share  information received from one party to another party in  any proceeding to which the reporter is assigned. (T-3). This includes witness lists and exhibit lists provided to the reporter in advance of trial to assist in the reporter’s preparation. 16.4.  Judicial and Administrative Proceedings.   16.4.1.  Administrative Proceedings.  Court reporters may be assigned to record or transcribe the  following  proceedings:    Administrative  Discharge  Boards,  Flying  Evaluation  Boards, Medical  Evaluation  Boards,  Command  Directed  Investigations,  Accident  Investigation Boards, Safety Investigation Boards, Board of Inquiries, and all other similar proceedings. 16.4.2.  Other  Proceedings  Under  the  Manual  for  Courts-Martial.    Court  reporters  may  be assigned  to  record  and  transcribe  depositions,  Article 32,  preliminary  hearings,  DuBay hearings, contingency confinement hearings, and courts of inquiry. The following guidance is provided for these proceedings. 16.4.2.1.  Depositions.   16.4.2.1.1.  Recording and Transcribing a Deposition.  A court reporter appointed for a  deposition  will  record  and  transcribe  the  deposition  verbatim.    (T-1).    Note  the opening and closing times and dates as well as the times and dates of any recesses or adjournments.  (T-1).  The format for transcribing depositions is found in Air Force Instruction 51-201,  Figure 4.4.    Depositions  may  be  recorded  on  digital  media, audiotape, or videotape. See Rule for Courts-Martial 702(g)(3).   16.4.2.1.2.  Authenticating  a  Deposition.  The  deposed  witness  need  not  sign  the deposition.  In accordance with Rule for Courts-Martial 702(f), the deposition officer will  authenticate  the  deposition  and  the  court  reporter  will  attest  to  it.   (T-0).    Air Force  Instruction 51-201,  Figure  4.5,  provides  a  format  for  the  authentication  and court reporter’s certificate.   16.4.2.1.3.  Written  Interrogatories.    Depositions  for  written  interrogatories  are recorded  and  authenticated  as  provided  by  Department  of  Defense  Form  456, Interrogatories and Depositions.   16.4.2.1.4.  Deposition Exhibits.  The court reporter will mark deposition exhibits in the  lower  right  corner  of  the  exhibit  using  Arabic  numerals  (e.g.,  as  “Deposition Exhibit 1, 2, etc.”).  (T-1). 16.4.2.2.  Article 32, UCMJ, Preliminary Hearings.   16.4.2.2.1.  Recording  a  Preliminary  Hearing.    Court  reporters  may  be  assigned  to record  testimony  in  Article 32,  UCMJ,  Preliminary  Hearings.    The  Government Counsel shall ensure the preliminary hearing is recorded utilizing a suitable recording device.  (T-0).  Court reporters will assist government counsel in ensuring the hearing is properly recorded.  (T-1).   16.4.2.2.2.  Additional Guidance.   Court reporters may  find more specific  guidance for  preliminary  hearings  in  Air  Force  Instruction  51-201,  Section  4A,  as  well  the Preliminary  Hearing Officer  Guide, Section 8, published by  the  Air  Force Military Justice Division,  Figure 16.3 contains a suggested format for summarized testimony. 16.4.2.3.  DuBay Hearings.  DuBay hearings are post-trial sessions ordered by an appellate court to find facts to assist the review of the case.  For more specific guidance on conducting these hearings, reference Air Force Instruction 51-201, para 11.15. 16.4.2.3.1.  Recording a DuBay Hearing.  The court reporter will record these proceedings verbatim unless otherwise directed.  (T-1). 16.4.2.3.2.  Transcribing a DuBay Hearing.  In transcribing the proceedings, the court reporter will use the same format used for courts-martial.  (T-1).  The court reporter will mark exhibits in the lower right corner of the exhibit using Arabic numerals (e.g., as “Hearing Exhibit 1, 2, etc.”).   16.4.2.3.3.  Authenticating a DuBay Hearing Transcript.  The military judge will authenticate the transcript for a DuBay hearing.  (T-0).   16.4.2.3.4.  Using Contents of the record of trial in the DuBay Hearing.  If documents are removed from the record of trial and used in the hearing, the court reporter will place a blank sheet of paper in the record of trial where the document was located and annotate where the document where the document has been relocated.  (T-1).   16.4.2.4.  Contingency Confinement Hearings.  Air Force Instruction 51-201, paragraph 9.34, sets forth the procedures for hearings to impose conditional confinement adjudged for failing to pay a fine.   16.4.2.4.1.  Transcribing a Contingency Confinement Hearing.  The proceedings may be summarized unless the convening authority directs a verbatim transcript.  The court reporter will transcribe the military judge’s statement of evidence and findings verbatim if done on the record.  (T-1).  If the military judge completes a written statement of evidence and findings, the court reporter will attach the statement to the record as a hearing exhibit.  (T-1).  The format for the transcript is the same as for courts-martial.   16.4.2.4.2.  Exhibits in a Contingency Confinement Hearing.  The court reporter will mark exhibits in the lower right corner of the exhibit using Arabic numerals (e.g., “Hearing Exhibit 1, 2, etc.”).  (T-1).  The court reporter will prepare and attach to the record a cover page like the front cover of the Department of Defense Form 490, Record of Trial, and an index of testimony and exhibits.  (T-1). 16.4.2.4.3.  Authenticating a Contingency Confinement Hearing Transcript.  The court reporter will prepare an authentication sheet for the military judge similar to the authentication sheet used in records of trial, substituting “Contingency Confinement Hearing” for “Record of Trial.”  (T-1).  Once authenticated, the court reporter will include the authentication sheet in the record of trial.  (T-1). 16.4.2.5.  Courts of Inquiry.  Air Force Instruction 51-201, paragraph 4.2 and Article 135, Uniform Code of Military Justice, discuss the requirements for courts of inquiry.  The parties to a court of inquiry are the members (the senior member is the president), counsel for the court is the legal advisor, the “known party” (referred to as the respondent), the known party’s counsel (referred to as respondent’s counsel), and the government representative (referred to as the recorder).   16.4.2.5.1.  Transcribing a Court of Inquiry.  The court reporter will prepare a verbatim transcript of the proceedings for the president of the court of inquiry and the legal advisor for the court to authenticate.  (T-0).   16.4.2.5.2.  Exhibits.  The court reporter will mark exhibits in the lower right corner.  (T-1).  Exhibits offered by the court are marked using Roman numerals                 (e.g., “Court Exhibit I, II, etc.”).  Exhibits offered by the respondent are marked alphabetically (e.g., “Respondent’s Exhibit A, B, etc.”).  The court reporter will prepare and attach to the record a cover sheet similar to the Department of Defense Form 490 as well as an index and list of exhibits.  (T-1). 16.5.  Court Reporter Recesses.  The court reporter should inform the military judge if feeling ill or fatigued so either a recess or a replacement court reporter, as appropriate, may be arranged. 16.6.  Interruption of Proceedings.  When anything interferes with the court reporter’s ability to record the proceeding verbatim (e.g, the court reporter is unable to hear the person speaking or the recording equipment is malfunctioning), the reporter must bring this to the attention of the military judge immediately.  (T-1).  The court reporter must check the equipment periodically to ensure it is functioning properly.  (T-1). 16.7.  Court-Martial Exhibits.  Court reporters should ensure that they have all of the exhibits at the close of each hearing and trial session.  Court reporters who are providing temporary duty support will not travel back to their home station with any original trial exhibits. (T-1).  Reporters are permitted to travel to their home station with copies of exhibits if necessary, provided they abide by applicable privacy and security guidelines.   16.8.  Court Reporter Checklist.  Court reporters should use a checklist to ensure all tasks are completed.  Figure 16.1 contains a sample checklist.  16.9.  Court  Reporter  Attestation.    The  court  reporter  who  recorded  the  proceeding  is ultimately responsible for attesting to the quality, authenticity of the transcript, and method used to transcribe the proceeding.  Even when the record is transcribed by another court reporter, the assigned court reporter will review the record for accuracy and sign an attestation to be inserted in  the  record  after  the  court  reporter  chronology.  (T-1).    A  sample  attestation  is  included  at Figure 16.2. 16.10.  Methods of Reporting.   16.10.1.  Requirement  for  Digital  Recording.    Digital  recording  is  the  primary  method  of recording.    Court  reporters  will  accomplish  digital  recording  by  using  the  latest  software approved by the Air Force Trial Judiciary. The use of cassette recording is prohibited except in cases of emergency when digital means of recording are unavailable. 16.10.1.1.  Recording Software.   16.10.1.1.1.  Standardizing the software and methods used to record court and board proceedings  across  the  Air Force  ensures  audio  is  easily  transferrable  to  any Air Force  or  sister  service  court  reporter  at  any  base  or  post  for  transcription assistance.    Additionally,  using  voice  recognition  redictation  enhances  the  court reporter’s ability to produce transcripts quicker without compromising accuracy. 16.10.1.1.2.  The software that is currently approved for use by the Air Force Trial Judiciary is For the Record Gold and Dragon Naturally Speaking.  In addition, court reporters are authorized to utilize the following software/technology for recording and preserving hearings through transcription: in conjunction with For the Record Gold, Computer  Assisted  Translation  software  (e.g.,  EclipseVox)  with  stenotype  (steno machine writing) or steno-mask with EclipseVox; steno-mask with Dragon Natrually Speaking; and/or redictation through Dragon Naturally Speaking using a headset with a  boom  microphone.    The  Air  Force  Trial  Judiciary  may  mandate  use  of  new court-reporting software when purchased and provided for use.  The Air Force Trial Judiciary will notify court reporters of any software updates or centrally  purchased equipment.  Court reporters may not use software that has not been approved for use by the Air Force Trial Judiciary.   16.10.1.2.  Open Microphone or Stenomask.  Court reporters are authorized to use open microphone recording or the stenomask (closed microphone) as a method to document the  proceedings.    Court  reporters  using  the  stenomask  must  do  so  using  the  For  the Record Gold software or replacement technology, and in conjunction with normal open microphone recording procedures. Court reporters may use the stenomask with real-time computer aided transcription while in court, provided that such use is accomplished in conjunction with normal open microphone recording procedures to include recording the proceeding verbatim with For the Record Gold or replacement technology.  16.10.1.2.1.  Open  Microphone  Procedures.    Court  reporters  recording  proceedings using  the  open  microphone  method  of  reporting  must  adhere  to  the  following procedures in addition to the requirements included elsewhere in this manual:  16.10.1.2.1.1.  Monitor the recording at all times by using the headset to ensure the proceeding is being recorded verbatim.  (T-1).  If there is noise that prevents the  reporter  from  hearing  what  is  on  the  recording  or  a  person  is  not  speaking loudly enough for the recording equipment to pick up what is being said, interrupt the proceedings to inform the military judge of the problem immediately.  (T-1).  This  procedure  ensures  that  a  clear  and  intelligible  recording  is  made  of everything being said. 16.10.1.2.1.2. Use  authorized  note-taking  tools  when  available,  to  generate detailed notes of what transpires during the course of the trial.  (T-1).  The Log Notes program allows the court reporter to automatically time-stamp and link the audio which  allows for  easy play  back.  Make  a note of any  gestures  made by counsel or a witness whether or not described on the record.  (T-1).  Also note case cites and terms with which the reporter is not familiar, and clarify during a recess or after court.  (T-1).   16.10.1.2.1.3.  Annotate all openings and closings of court-martial sessions on the record with dates and times.  (T-0). 16.10.1.2.1.4.  A suggested list of notable entries is listed below; however, it is not all-inclusive: 16.10.1.2.1.4.1.  The detailing of counsel and counsel qualifications; 16.10.1.2.1.4.2.

Care inquiry; 16.10.1.2.1.4.14.  Pretrial agreement, if any; 16.10.1.2.1.4.15.  Announcement of findings; 16.10.1.2.1.4.16.  Members called; 16.10.1.2.1.4.17.  Swearing in of court members; 16.10.1.2.1.4.18.  Assembly of court-martial; 16.10.1.2.1.4.19.  Preliminary instructions to members; 16.10.1.2.1.4.20.  Voir dire, en banc and individual; 16.10.1.2.1.4.21.  Challenges; 16.10.1.2.1.4.22.  Members informed of accused’s pleas; 16.10.1.2.1.4.23.  Distribution of charges to the members; 16.10.1.2.1.4.24.  Opening statements; 16.10.1.2.1.4.25.  The  calling  of  each  witness  and  direct  and  cross-examination, any obligations and rulings, and excusal of each witness;  16.10.1.2.1.4.26.  Any  documentary  or  physical  evidence objections, rulings, and place where admitted or rejected; introduced, 16.10.1.2.1.4.27.  Resting of case by either side, rebuttal, and surrebuttal; 16.10.1.2.1.4.28.  Rights  in  extenuation,  mitigation,  and  right  to  make  a statement; 16.10.1.2.1.4.29.  Arguments on findings/sentence; 16.10.1.2.1.4.30.  Instructions on findings/sentence; 16.10.1.2.1.4.31.  Announcement of findings/sentence;  16.10.1.2.1.4.32.  Personal data on accused introduced; 16.10.1.2.1.4.33.  Sentence limitations contained in pretrial agreement; 16.10.1.2.1.4.34.  Post-trial and appellate rights advisement;  16.10.1.2.1.4.35.  Adjournment; and 16.10.1.2.1.4.36.  Privileged  evidence,  testimony  or  arguments  that  are required to be sealed by the military judge.  16.10.1.2.2.  Additional  Note  Requirements  when  Requesting  Transcription Assistance.  When any audio recording is sent for transcription assistance, the court reporter  recording  the  proceeding  must  include  notes  annotating  when  a  speaker changes  as well  as any  and all notable  gestures  by the parties.   (T-3).  These notes ensure  the  transcribing  court  reporter  or  court  reporters  not  present  during  the proceeding are able to quickly and accurately identify the current speaker.   16.10.2.  Requirement  for  Backup  Reporting  Method.    Court  reporters  must  use  both  a primary  and  backup  system  to  ensure  a  record  can  be  accurately  prepared.  (T-1).    The recommended  backup  method  is  to  attach  a  separate  digital  hand-held  recorder  to  the “monitor all” jack on the back of the Digital Multiplex-8 Universal Serial Bus Mixer.  This method  requires  the  court  reporter  to  not  only  consistently  monitor  the  battery  life  on  the digital hand-held recorder, but also press “record” or “stop” on the digital hand-held recorder to ensure proper and continued operation.  In addition, a special audio cord, a 3.5mm double ended cord, is needed to be placed in the “mono” jack of the recorder.  Failure to comply will result in the backup system not recording the audio.   16.11.  Time Goals.  The time required to transcribe a record varies depending on a number of factors, such as the complexity of the case, the effectiveness of the court reporter’s equipment, the  quality  of  the  court  reporter’s  trial  notes,  and  the  court  reporter’s  familiarity  with  the equipment and software.  As a general guideline, one hour of in-court proceedings should take no more than five hours to transcribe and, in more complex cases, no more than seven hours to transcribe.    The  Air  Force  Trial  Judiciary  should  suspense  transcription  assistance  as  follows:  one hour of audio should be allocated one duty day to transcribe.  In calculating in-court time, For the Record Gold is capable of indicating the exact length of audio recorded each day. 16.12.  Safeguarding Recordings and Evidence.  The court reporter must safeguard their laptop and evidence during recesses and while preparing the record of trial. (T-1).  If a recording or evidence is lost, a verbatim transcript may not be able to be prepared, which may result in the convening  authority  being  unable  to  approve  the  findings  or  the  adjudged  sentence.                   See R.C.M. 1103(f).  During recesses and overnight adjournments, court reporters should keep all recordings, transcriptions, and evidence provided to them in a locked drawer or cabinet when not under their direct observation.  Court reporters should follow these security measures while preparing the record of trial and continue until receiving an authenticated record of trial.  If a recording, transcription, or evidence becomes lost or missing, the court reporter will immediately notify the military judge, trial counsel, or the Staff Judge Advocate.  (T-1).   16.13.  Retention  of  Trial  Notes  or  Recordings.    Court  reporters  will  retain  all  their  notes, worksheets,  relevant  materials,  copies  of  audio  and  videotapes,  and  recordings  of  the  original proceedings  subject  to  the  Air Force  Records  Information  Management  System  Records Disposition Schedule and the rules described below.  (T-0).  Court reporters will annotate these materials with the accused’s name, date of trial, and other pertinent data.  (T-1).  Following the disposition rules ensures records are not needlessly retained past their disposition date. 16.13.1.  Preliminary Hearings under Article 32, Uniform Code of Military Justice.  In cases where  a  preliminary  hearing  under  Article 32  was  held,  but  charges  were  not  referred  to court-martial,  the  court  reporter’s  recordings  and  notes  may  be  destroyed  on  the  date  of dismissal.  See Records Disposition Schedule, Table 51-03, Rule 36.00.  However, Rule for Courts-Martial 405 and Air Force Instruction 51-201 require that a copy of the recording of the preliminary hearing be provided to the Defense Counsel and, upon request, to the victim (if  applicable)  as  soon  as  practicable  following  the  hearing.    In  a  case  involving  named victims, the court reporter will consult with trial counsel prior to destroying any recording of a preliminary hearing.  (T-0). 16.13.2.  Court-Martial  Acquittal.  In  cases  resulting  in  full  acquittal,  the  court  reporter’s recordings  and  notes  may  be  destroyed  on  the  date  of  final  action  or  publication  of  the court-martial order.  See Records Disposition Schedule, Table 51-03, Rule 36.00. 16.13.3.  Special Court-Martial Conviction without a Punitive Discharge.  In cases where a special court-martial resulted in conviction for some offense, but a punitive discharge was not adjudged, the court reporter’s recordings and notes may be destroyed six months after the date the sentence is announced.  See Records Disposition Schedule, Table 51-03, Rule 34.00. 16.13.4.  General  Court-Martial  Conviction  or  Special  Court-Martial  Conviction  with  a Punitive  Discharge.    In  cases  where  (1)  a  general  court-martial  resulted  in  conviction  for some  offense,  or  (2)  a  special  court-martial  resulted  in  a  punitive  discharge,  the  court reporter’s  recordings  and  notes  may  be  destroyed  one  year  after  the  date  the  sentence  is announced  or  60 days  after  the  conclusion  of  appellate  review,  whichever  is  later.              See Records Disposition Schedule, Table 51-03, Rule 35.00. 16.13.5.  If  a  court  reporter’s  recordings  or  notes  are  requested  under  the  Freedom  of Information Act, then Department of Defense 5400.7-R_Air Force Manual 33-302, Freedom of Information Act Program, requires that the records be retained pending a decision whether to release the records by a competent release authority.  If release of the records is denied in whole  or  in  part,  then  Department  of  Defense  5400.7-R_Air  Force  Manual  33-302  also requires the requested records be retained for six years after the date of denial to meet the statute of limitations requirement.  See paragraph C5.2.9.  This rule takes precedence over any of the above disposition rules.  This rule applies even if, prior to receiving the Freedom of  Information  request,  the  requested  record  could  have  been  destroyed  under  one  of  the above disposition rules.  A court reporter will consult with the Staff Judge Advocate prior to destroying  any  recording  or  related  record  that  has  been  requested  under  the  Freedom  of Information Act.  (T-0). 16.14.  WebDocs.  Upon authentication, court reporters will upload the record of trial transcript and authentication sheet to WebDocs.  (T-1).  The court reporter may not upload sealed portions of a transcript to WebDocs. (T-1).  Where a transcript contains sealed portions, the court reporter will insert cross-reference sheets annotating those sealed portions.  (T-1). 16.15.  Centralized  Court  Reporter  Management  and  Court  Reporter  Travel  and Transcription  Assistance.    Effective  17 February  2016,  as  directed  by  The  Judge  Advocate General, the Air Force Trial Judiciary became responsible for the centralized management of the court reporter program and the single point of contact for all requests for transcription assistance and court reporter temporary duty support.  The Air Force Trial Judiciary has direct interaction with  the  wing,  numbered  air  force,  and  major  command  personnel  in  the  scheduling  of  each court reporter.  Effective upon completion of all required union notifications, and in accordance with  the  Position  Descriptions  that  require  travel  as  part  of  a  court  reporter’s  duties,  the  Air Force Trial Judiciary management authority will have authority to task court reporters for travel.  16.15.1.  Decision Authority.  The Chief Trial Judge is responsible for all policies pertaining to  court  reporters  and  the  overall  management  of  the  court  reporter  program.    Decisions regarding  temporary  duty  or  transcription  support  are  based  on  the  Air Force’s  worldwide mission, workload, and the best interests of the Air Force.  Decisions of the Chief Trial Judge are considered final.  16.15.2.  Operational Delegation.  For operational purposes, authority is delegated to the the Air  Force  Trial  Judiciary  Court  Reporter  Manager.    The  Court  Reporter  Manager,  in coordination with the Central Docketing Office and based upon the schedules posted in the docketing  calendar  will  detail  court  reporters  to  travel,  record,  or  transcribe  proceedings; maintain and monitor a secure webpage for the exchange of electronic files of proceedings; and determine the priority of transcription and travel as needed.  16.15.3.  Processing  a  Request  for  Temporary  Duty  Assistance.    All  court  reporter  travel assistance requests should be submitted through the SharePoint Centralized Court Reporter Management Homepage to ensure requests are tracked and timely processed.     16.15.3.1.  Assignment.   16.15.3.1.1.  The Air Force Trial Judiciary prioritizes travel requests in line with all other requests until a court reporter is available and assigned.  The Air Force Trial Judiciary will review the docketing calendar and determine who is available for the requested date.  The Air Force Trial Judiciary will attempt to solicit volunteers for any request received more than two weeks in advance of the proceeding.  If a request is  received  less  than  two  weeks  in  advance  of  a  proceeding,  the  Air  Force  Trial Judiciary may assign a court reporter without soliciting volunteers.  16.15.3.1.2.  Once the Air Force Trial Judiciary confirms with the court reporter that the docketing calendar is accurate, the Air Force Trial Judiciary will notify the court reporter  of  the  assignment  telephonically  and  via  email.    The  Air  Force  Trial Judiciary should also notify the requesting point of contact and both the requesting base  and  home  station  Staff  Judge  Advocate  and  Law  Office  Superintendent.  Transcription services taken by a temporary duty court reporter can normally be done at  the  court  reporter’s  home  station  unless  an  extended  temporary  duty  for transcription services is requested by the court or requesting installation. 16.15.3.1.2.1.  Calendar  Updates.    The  Court  Reporter  Manager  will  update  the SharePoint Centralized Court Reporter Management website upon issuing a court reporter  the  assignment.    The  assigned  court  reporter  should  ensure  his  or  her docketing calendar reflects the assignment.  See paragraph 16.18. 16.15.3.1.2.2.  Travel Arrangements.  The assigned court reporter will coordinate with the requesting base’s Law Office Superintendent, requesting point of contact, court reporter, and appropriate military justice personnel on the details of his or her travel.  The Air Force Trial Judiciary  will not maintain  information  for the traveler’s requirements and is not the point of contact for Defense Travel System setup or issues. 16.15.3.1.2.3.  Overtime During Temporary Duty Assignment.  When the need for overtime  work  during  temporary  duty  assignments  is  known  in  advance,  the requesting  base  Staff  Judge  Advocate  should  note  this  at  the  time  of  the  travel request, or as soon as practicable.  In such cases, the requesting base Staff Judge Advocate must also notify the civilian reporter and their supervising Staff Judge Advocate  of  the  need  for  overtime  work.    (T-1).    The  requesting  Staff  Judge Advocate  is  responsible  for  paying  the  overtime.    Paragraph 16.16  provides additional discussion on overtime. 16.15.3.2.  Request for Release from Temporary Duty Assignment.   16.15.3.2.1.  Generally.  A request for release from a temporary duty assignment has significant  potential  to  negatively  impact  the  overall  court  reporter  management process.  To minimize any scheduling or assignment conflicts, court reporters should keep their docketing calendars current at all times.   16.15.3.2.2.  Process  for  Requesting  Release.  The  court  reporter  must  submit  any request  for  release  from  temporary  duty  travel  in  writing.    Figure 16.4  provides  a template  for  a  temporary  duty  release  request.    Release  requires  approval  from  the court  reporter’s  major  command  Staff  Judge  Advocate  and  the  the  Air  Force  Trial Judiciary Chief Trial Judge.  A court reporter is responsible for the temporary duty assignment until approved for release by the Chief Trial Judge or delegate.  The Court Reporter  Manager  will  track  all  requests  for  release,  whether  approved  or disapproved, in SharePoint for reporting purposes.  16.15.4.  Processing a Request for Transcription Assistance.  All court reporter transcription assistance requests should be submitted through the SharePoint Centralized Court Reporter Management Homepage to ensure requests are tracked and timely processed.    16.15.4.1.  Assignment.  The Air Force Trial Judiciary prioritizes transcription requests in line with all other requests until a court reporter is available and assigned.  The Air Force Trial Judiciary will make the assignment as soon as practicable after verifying that a court reporter is available to support the request.  The Air Force Trial Judiciary will notify the court reporter of the assignment telephonically and via electronic mail.  The Air Force Trial Judiciary should also notify the requesting point of contact, and both the requesting base and home station Staff Judge Advocate and Law Office Superintendent. 16.15.4.1.1.  Calendar  Updates.    The  Court  Reporter  Manager  will  update  the SharePoint  Centralized  Court  Reporter  Management  website  upon  issuing  a  court reporter  the  assignment.    The  assigned  court  reporter  should  ensure  his  or  her docketing calendar reflects the assignment.  See paragraph 16.18. 16.15.4.1.2.  Suspense  Date  and  Extensions.  The  Air  Force  Trial  Judiciary  will provide  the  assigned  court  reporter  a  suspense  date  to  complete  the  assignment.  Generally,  a  reporter  will  be  allotted  one  duty  day  for  every  one  hour  of  audio  to complete the transcription.  If the court reporter is unable to meet the suspense date, the  requestiong  and  home  station  Staff  Judge  Advocates  will  coordinate  any necessary  extensions.    The  Air  Force  Trial  Judiciary  will  not  directly  negotiate  or approve extensions.  16.15.4.2.  Attestation.  The transcribing court reporter is responsible for the record in its entirety  and  its  accuracy.    The  court  reporter  will  accomplish  an  attestation  for  a completed transcription.  Figure 16.2 includes template language for an attestation. 16.15.4.3.  Providing the Audio for Transcription.  The Staff Judge Advocate or designee responsible  for  the  proceeding  to  be  transcribed  will  ensure  the  audio  and  any accompanying  files  is  uploaded  and  available  to  the  assigned  court  reporter.    (T-1).  Audio  recordings  provided  for  transcription  should  generally  be  provided  in  the authorized  For  the  Record  Gold  version  with  Log  Notes  completed.    If  the  uploaded audio does not conform to the established requirements or the audio is of poor quality, the court  reporter  will  consult  with  the  Court  Reporter  Manager.      If  the  Court  Reporter Manager  concurs  that  the  transcription  cannot  reasonably  be  accomplished,  the  Court Reporter  Manager  will  return  the  recording  and  accompanying  files  to  the  requesting point of contact and inform that person of the reason for being unable to complete the transcription. .  16.15.4.4.  Priority.  Transcription duties should take priority over all non-court reporting duties  assigned  to  court  reporters  at  the  base  level.    The  court  reporter  will  notify  the requesting  point  of  contact  of  any  if  the  court  reporter  becomes  aware  of  a  new transcription or court reporting requirement that he or she believes should take priority over any  assigned transcription. (T-3).  Paragraph 16.17 provides  additional discussion on workload prioritization. 16.15.4.5.  Requesting Release from Transcription Assignment.   16.15.4.5.1.  Generally.    A  request  for  release  from  a  transcription  assignment  has significant  potential  to  negatively  impact  the  overall  court  reporter  management process.  To minimize any scheduling or assignment conflicts, court reporters should keep their docketing calendars current at all times. 16.15.4.5.2.  Process  for  Requesting  Release.    The  court  reporter  must  submit  any request for release from a transcription assignment in writing.   Figure 16.5 provides a template  for  a  transcription  assignment  release  request.    Release  requires  approval from the court reporter’s major command Staff Judge Advocate and the Chief Trial Judge.  A court reporter is responsible for the transcription assignment until approved for release by the Chief Trial Judge or delegate.  The Court Reporter Manager will track  all  requests  for  release,  whether  approved  or  disapproved,  in  SharePoint  for reporting purposes.  16.16.  Overtime.    Court  proceedings,  temporary  duty  assignments,  transcription  services,  or other duties may require overtime work.  Staff Judge Advocates are ultimately responsible for determining whether their budget allots for overtime pay prior to authorizing overtime work for civilian reporters.  Overtime and compensatory time procedures are governed by law, Air Force regulations, and applicable collective bargaining agreements.  Overtime work conducted at the civilian reporter’s duty station in connection with a court proceeding for the duty station is to be approved in advance.  When it is determined by the court that a proceeding will exceed an 8-hour workday, trial counsel or the civilian reporter must notify the Staff Judge Advocate as soon as practicable  so  that  overtime  can  be  approved  for  the  reporter.    (T-1).    When  overtime  is approved,  the  civilian  reporter  may  choose  between  accepting  overtime  pay  or  compensatory time for overtime work. 16.17.  Workload Prioritization.   16.17.1.  Generally.    All  assistance  requests  will  be  prioritized  by  the  Air  Force  Trial Judiciary.  The Air Force Trial Judiciary workload prioritization is based on the needs of the Air Force  and  available  resources.    It  is  subject  to  change  at  the  discretion  of  the  Court Reporter  Manager.    Court  reporters  who  are  assigned  a  tasking  must  notify  the  Air  Force Trial  Judiciary  of  any  changes  or  additions  to  their  workload  which  would  delay  the completion of assigned tasking.   16.17.2.  Categories.  The Air Force Trial Judiciary will prioritize a request using one of the following general categories:  16.17.2.1.  Priority 1 – Courts martial and Article 32 preliminary hearings involving an alleged offense under Articles 120 or 125, Uniform Code of Military Justice, or attempts to commit such an offense.  These proceedings will ordinarily necessitate a request for travel/temporary duty support. 16.17.2.2.  Priority 2 – Accident Investigation Boards.  These proceedings will ordinarily necessitate a request for travel/temporary duty support and transcription. 16.17.2.3.  Priority 3 – Discharge boards (travel) 16.17.2.4.  Priority 4 – Medical credential hearings and flying evaluation boards (travel) 16.17.2.5.  Priority 5 – Courts-martial and Article 32 preliminary hearings involving alleged offenses under Articles 120 and 125 (transcribe) 16.17.2.6.  Priority 6 – Discharge boards (transcribe) 16.17.2.7.  Priority 7 – Medical credential hearings and flying evaluation boards (transcribe) 16.17.2.8.  Priority 8 –All others (command-directed investigations, labor hearings, DuBay hearings, Office of Special Investigation interviews, etc.) 16.17.2.9.  Priority 9 – Sister service support (case-by-case basis)  16.17.3.  Court  Reporter  Detailing.  The  Court Reporter  Manager  may  approve  or  deny  a release request from a tasking, with concurrence of the Chief Trial Judge or Deputy Chief Trial Judge.   16.17.4.  Central Tasking Authority Prioritization.  The Air Force Trial Judiciary will detail court reporters in the following order of priority:    16.17.4.1.  Priority 1 – Court reporters will be detailed to referred courts-martial and hearings at the installation to which they are assigned.  All court reporters must notify the Air Force Trial Judiciary of any changes or additions to their workload, which would delay the completion of an assigned tasking.  16.17.4.2.  Priority 2 – Enlisted court reporters will be detailed outside their assigned installation upon consideration by the Court Reporter Manager of the following factors, to include, but not limited to:  availability, recent travel, workload, travel costs to requested hearing.  16.17.4.3.  Priority 3 – Volunteer court reporters will be detailed outside their assigned installation upon consideration by the Court Reporter Manager of the following factors, to include, but not limited to:  availability, recent travel, workload, travel costs to requested hearing.  16.17.4.4.  Priority 4 – Civilian court reporters within the circuit of the office requesting travel will be detailed upon consideration by the Court Reporter Manager of the following factors to include, but not limited to:  availability, recent travel, workload, travel costs to requested hearing.  16.17.4.5. Priority 5 – Civilian court reporters outside the circuit of the office requesting travel will be detailed upon consideration by Court Reporter Manager of the following factors to include, but not limited to:  availability, recent travel, workload, travel costs to requested hearing.  16.18.  Judiciary Docketing System.  The Judiciary Docketing System is the primary means by which the Air Force Trial Judiciary determines the availability of court reporters to either travel or assist in transcribing records.  Each court reporter must keep his or her Judiciary Docketing System  calendar  updated.    Required  entries  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  courts-martial, discharge  boards,  accident  investigation  boards,  transcription,  and  leave.    Court  reporters  will enter all assignments into their calendar.  (T-1).  The Court Reporter Manager may edit these assignments.  Staff Judge Advocates, Law Office Superintendents, and court reporters requiring access to the Judiciary Docketing System should contact the Air Force Trial Judiciary. 16.19.  Court Reporting Training.  Court reporters need timely refresher training to best equip them to support the worldwide Air Force needs.  Such training enables court reporters to upgrade their  skills,  to  become  and  remain  current  on  areas  of  court  reporting,  and  to  broaden  their knowledge base.  Supervisors should strive to foster an environment in which continuing training of court reporters is encouraged and utilized at least twice per year. 16.19.1. Training through Distance Learning.  Staff Judge Advocates are encouraged to allow court reporters sufficient time to participate in refresher training provided by the Air Force Trial Judiciary and outside agencies.  These sessions can provide additional training, address issues of local interest, or instruct court reporters on how to handle recurring matters.  Due to the location of each court reporter, a live webcast via CAMPUS or the Defense Collaboration Services (DCS) is the preferred method for training; however, court reporters may download the training at a later date, to a local server, and view the training when their schedule permits. 16.19.2.  In-person Training.  Staff Judge Advocates are encouraged to allow court reporters to attend training in-person provided by the Air Force Trial Judiciary and outside agencies for their professional development. 16.19.3.  Scheduling  and  Tracking  Training.    Court  reporters  should  coordinate  the scheduling of all training with their supervisors.  Scheduling should be consistent with the needs of the legal office and the availability of the court reporter.   16.20.  Adopted Forms.

Format.  Prepare the Record of Trial (ROT) as prescribed in the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), Appendices 13 and 14, Rules for Courts-Martial (RCMs) 1103 through 1305, and this manual.  Figures 4.1 and 7.1 are guides for assembling ROTs.  Submit requests for deviations from this manual to AFLOA/JAJM. 1.2.  Paper.  Use 15-pound bond or other high-quality 8 ½ by 11-inch paper.  Redlined margins and other legal formats, such as numbered lines, are acceptable. 1.3.  Margins.  Leave a margin of 1 ½ inches, or more as necessary, on the top of each page to permit binding.  Leave a one-inch margin on the bottom and on the left and right sides of each page. 1.4.  Font.  Use 12-point with only Courier New or Times-New Roman fonts.  Avoid a cursive or italic font, except when appropriate (e.g., citations).  Use bold type for the initial identification of the accused, judge, counsel, court members, court reporter, and in the introductory preface to identify each witness.  Type the complete name, including rank or other title, in bold print.  In the introductory preface for identifying witnesses, type the name of the witness and the entire introductory clause describing the witness being called and sworn in bold type.  Also use bold type  to  identify  various  stages  of  the  proceedings  (e.g.,  Article  39(a)  Session,  Direct Examination, Pleas, Findings, Sentence) and to identify the transition for questions being asked by trial counsel, defense counsel or the military judge.  (For examples, see Attachment 4.)  Use of bold type to identify names at other locations in the ROT is not required, including names of individuals  not  participating  in  the  trial  (e.g.,  names  of  individuals  referenced  in  witness testimony). 1.5.  Page Breaks and Line Spacing. 1.5.1.  Begin  each  session  of  court,  as  well  as  each  Article  39(a)  session,  on  a  new  page separate from the other transcribed proceedings.  The reporter should note the time and date of the beginning and ending of each session of the court, including the opening and closing of the court-martial during the trial. 1.5.2.  Double-space text, returning to the left margin on second and subsequent lines, with the exception of pleas, findings, and sentence, which should be single-spaced, indented, and in bold print.  Individual elements of offenses in guilty plea cases may be single-spaced but double-space between separate elements. 1.5.3.  Continue  double-spacing  the  text  when  changes  in  speakers  occur,  including  the question and answer (“Q” and “A”) portions of the transcript.  When typing questions and answers, ensure at least two lines or the entire text of a question or answer appears at the bottom of a page.  Page break in appropriate places where necessary.  Do not repeat the “Q” or “A” prefix at the top of the next page.  To the extent practicable, use page breaks so that the answer to a question does not appear on a page separate from the question. 1.5.4.  See Attachment 4 for examples of page breaks and line spacing within transcripts.   8  AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009 1.6.  Justification.  Use  left  justification  only,  with  the  exception  of  pleas,  findings,  sentence, and elements of offenses in guilty plea cases, which may be justified both left and right.  When using left justification, indent five spaces from the left margin and type the appropriate prefix to indicate the identity of the speaker followed by a colon and two spaces.  Also, indent five spaces from the left margin when typing the appropriate “Q” or “A” prefix followed by a period and two spaces.  (See samples in Attachment 4.)   If a speaker’s testimony consists of two or more continuous, uninterrupted paragraphs, the subsequent paragraph(s) should be indented but do not require insertion of the speaker or “Q” and “A” prefix. 1.7.  Punctuation  Marks.  Do  not  use  exclamation  marks.    Dashes  or  hyphens  may  be  used where the speaker changes thought or subject, where one participant interrupts another, or where other  punctuation  is  not  appropriate.    Use  periods  at  the  end  of  complete  thoughts  to  avoid lengthy sentences.  Avoid phonetic spelling.  Obtain correct spelling from counsel or the witness.  The Government Printing Office Style Manual is a useful guide for punctuation. 1.8.  Numbering Pages. 1.8.1.  Number all pages in the transcribed ROT consecutively, beginning with "1." Center the page number on the page ¾ inch from the bottom.  If material is omitted and additional pages must be inserted, use the preceding page number plus a decimal and an Arabic number after the corresponding whole numbered page (e.g., “19.1”).  In addition, annotate the bottom of  the  preceding  page  to  reflect  the  following  inserted  page  (e.g.,  “next  page  19.1”)  and annotate the return to consecutive numbering at the bottom of the last inserted page  (e.g., “next  page  20”).    If  a  page  number  is  omitted,  but  no  page  is  actually  missing  from  the transcript,  note  the  missing  page  number  at  the  bottom  of  the  page  preceding  the  missing page  number  (e.g.,  “there  is  no  page  22;  next  page  23”).    The  last  numbered  page  is  the adjournment  of  the  court.    This  the  number  of  pages  entered  in  AMJAMS  on  the  ROT Authentication Tab. 1.8.2.  A  sample  format  for  page  1  of  the  transcribed  ROT  is  in  Figure  4.3    Type  at  the bottom of page 1 “The convening orders, Special Order ____, dated ____ and Special Order ____, dated ____, are numbered as pages 1.1, 1.2, etc.” Type the appropriate page numbers on the convening order and any amendment to the convening order in the middle of the page one-half  inch  from  the  bottom  of  the  order.    The  charge  sheet  is  numbered  in  the  same manner.  For example, at the bottom of the page preceding the insertion of the charge sheet type, “The charge sheet is numbered pages 4.1 through 4.5.” 1.9.  Printer.  Print all ROTs in a manner to produce a letter quality manuscript – a clear, solid, black imprint.  Laser and ink-jet printers are authorized and preferred in that order. 1.10.  Exhibits. 1.10.1.  Taken from Article 32 Reports.  When part of the Article 32, UCMJ, investigation is used during the trial and made an exhibit, remove the item from the Article 32 report and insert it at the appropriate point in the ROT.  Insert a sheet of paper in the Article 32 report stating where the original exhibit appears in the ROT.  If the entire Article 32 report is made an  exhibit,  insert  a  sheet  of  paper  at  the  place  in  the  ROT  where  the  Article  32  report normally goes (See Figure 4.1), stating where the report appears in the ROT. 1.10.2.  Substituting for Originals.  When possible, obtain the military judge's permission to withdraw an exhibit that consists of physical evidence and substitute a written description, AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009   9  photograph, or other means of description in the ROT.  Do not substitute a photograph of a videotape  for  a  videotape  or  other  recording  admitted  into  evidence  and  played  in  court.  Substitute photocopies of documents for the originals and return originals to the document custodian.    Withdrawal  and  substitution  may  be  made  without  the  military  judge’s permission  if  trial  and  defense  counsel  agree  on  the  replacement  photograph,  replica,  or description.  See RCM 913(c)(2), Discussion. 1.10.3.  Withdrawal  of  Exhibits.    Describe  exhibits  withdrawn  from  the  original  ROT  and substitute the description in the original and all copies of the ROT.  Include the reasons for the withdrawal and substitution in the ROT. 1.10.4.  Photographs.  Because written descriptions are permitted as substitutes for exhibits withdrawn from the ROT, photographs are not necessary unless a photograph is essential to the appellate process.  For example, a photograph of a small quantity of marijuana may well be extraneous.  If photographs are used, use 5” x 7” color photographs whenever possible.  Several exhibits may be described on a single sheet of paper.  Photographs taken by digital cameras are authorized. 1.10.5.  Identifying  Exhibits.    The  reporter  is  responsible  for  ensuring  exhibits  offered  for identification or admission are properly marked.  Mark exhibits at the bottom right corner of the  page  if  possible.    Except  in  rare  cases,  the  court  reporter,  not  counsel,  premarks  both Prosecution and Defense exhibits to ensure the exhibits are marked uniformly.  Premarking should occur prior to commencement of trial, if possible.  A stamp labeling the exhibit and also indicating when in the record the exhibit was offered and admitted or rejected should be available to the court reporter.  Do not use stick-on labels to mark exhibits unless stamps are unavailable.  Labels come off exhibits and make it difficult to later identify exhibits.  The court reporter is responsible for informing counsel of this policy.  Note the page(s) at which an exhibit is offered and admitted or rejected, as well as noting those pages on the Master Index (see Figure 4.2).  The following is suggested language and format for exhibit stamps: Prosecution Ex __ for Identification Offered Page __ Accepted/ Rejected Page __  Defense Ex __ for Identification Offered Page __ Accepted/Rejected Page __    Appellate Ex __ Marked Page __   When there is not enough space at the bottom right corner of a page for this information, mark the exhibit elsewhere on the front lower portion of the page.  If there still is insufficient space, affix a blank sheet of paper to the front of the exhibit and place the stamp on the blank sheet as described above and type or print under the stamp “Consisting of ___ pages.”  Follow this procedure for 8” x 10” photographs (however, use 5” x 7” photographs whenever possible).  For smaller photographs, mount them on a blank sheet of paper and stamp the sheet of paper as described above.  For exhibits consisting of more than one page, stamp or type “Page ___ of ___ pages.”  Number each side of a two-sided document as a separate page.  Do not place exhibit stamps or labels on exhibits that will be returned to the owner (including the accused) after trial.    10  AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009 Mark these exhibits lightly in pencil in the lower right-hand margin of the document, e.g., “Pros Ex 1 for ID,” “Def Ex A for ID,” “App Ex I.”  If there is insufficient room to mark the front lower portion of a document that is to be returned to its owner, it is permissible to mark the exhibit on the back side of the document in the lower right-hand corner.   1.10.6.  Bulky Exhibits.  Do not send bulky physical items admitted into evidence with the ROT.  Withdraw these items and replace them with a photograph or an accurate description.  When the size of an object is important, include a ruler or yardstick in the photograph. 1.10.7.  Judicial  Notice.    When  the  military  judge  takes  judicial  notice  of  a  document, publication or other item, reproduce the pertinent part of, or all of, the document, publication or item, if possible.  If the document, publication or item was not marked as an exhibit, attach it to the ROT as an allied paper.  For publications, include the first or cover page, an extract of the relevant contents, and, if applicable, a copy of the signature page in the ROT. AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009   11  Chapter 2 COPYING RECORDS OF TRIAL 2.1.  Reproduction  Methods.  Photocopy  the  original  ROT  on  an  office  copier  or  use  base reproduction services if they are available and warranted. 2.2.  One-Sided Copies.  Produce the original transcript and all copies on one side of the paper only.  Whenever a double-sided original document exists in a ROT, ensure that both the front and reverse sides of the page are numbered in the original ROT.  When making copies of the ROT, ensure the reverse side of any double-sided original document is copied to a separate page. 2.3.  Evidence  That  Should  Not  Be  Copied.  Do  not  use  photographs  or  other  full-size reproductions of obligations or securities of the United States and foreign countries (currency, coins,  bonds,  etc.),  or  identification  cards,  passes,  official  badges,  and  other  insignia  of  any department or agency of the United States.  In such cases, if a written description will not suffice, include the item itself, or the original document or paper, in the ROT.   12  AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009 Chapter 3 NUMBER OF COPIES OF THE ROT 3.1.  Verbatim Transcript Required under RCM 1103.  Prepare an original and four copies.  Forward the original and two copies to AFLOA/JAJM.  The remaining copies are for the accused and retention by the base or general court-martial (GCM) legal office, as appropriate.  The copy of the record of trial maintained at the base office must be identical to the original record of trial forwarded to JAJM. 3.1.1.  If a verbatim transcript is required under RCM 1103 but the sentence does not include death, a punitive discharge, or confinement for more than one year, review by the Air Force Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  is  not  required.    RCM  1201(a).    In  these  cases,  prepare  the original and two copies.  Forward the original to AFLOA/JAJM.  The remaining copies are for the accused and retention by the base or GCM legal office, as appropriate.  However, if The Judge Advocate General subsequently directs appellate review under RCM 1201(b)(1), prepare and forward two additional copies to AFLOA/JAJM. 3.2.  Sentence  Includes  Confinement  for  12  Months  or  More.  Prepare an original and five copies.  Distribute the original and four copies as provided in paragraph 3.1  Forward the fifth copy to the confinement facility. 3.3.  Cases in which Offender is in Confinement at the United States Disciplinary Barracks (USDB).  Prepare an original and five copies.  Distribute the original and four copies as provided in paragraph 3.1  Forward the fifth copy to the USDB.  This applies to all officer and enlisted members confined at the USDB, even if their sentence of confinement is less than 12 months. and  Special  Courts-Martial 3.4.  All  Other  General  Courts-Martial (SPCM).  Prepare  an  original  and  two  copies.    Forward  the  original  to  AFLOA/JAJM.    The remaining  copies  are  for  the  accused  and  retention  by  the  base  or  GCM  legal  office,  as appropriate. 3.5.  Summary  Courts-Martial  (SCM).  Prepare  an  original  and  seven  copies.    Forward  the original and three copies of the DD Form 2329 to AFLOA/JAJM.  The remaining copies are for the accused, defense counsel, and the base and GCM legal offices. 3.6.  Additional  Copies.  In  addition  to  the  minimum  number  of  copies  needed,  a  staff  judge advocate  (SJA),  on  behalf  of  the  convening  authority,  may  authorize  additional  copies.    For example,  an  additional  copy  may  be  reproduced  and  distributed  to  the  individual  defense counsel. (GCM) 3.6.1.  Copies provided to Victims.  Victims of a crime punishable under Article 120, UCMJ, who  testified  during  the  proceedings  of  a  special  or  general  court-martial  are  entitled  to  a copy of the record of proceedings without charge as soon as the records are authenticated. 3.6.2.  In  a  case  with  a  conviction,  in  accordance  with  RCM  1103(b)(2)(B-D),  provide victims with the record of proceedings to include: a copy of the record of trial; a copy of the charge sheet; a copy of the convening order and any amending orders; a copy of the request, if  any,  for  trial  by  military  judge  alone,  or  that  the  membership  of  the  court  shall  include enlisted persons; a copy of the exhibits which were received in evidence; and, when made available,  a  copy  of  the  dated,  signed,  action  by  the  convening  authority.    Since  the AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009   13  convening  authority’s  action  is  normally  prepared  after  authentication,  offer  to  delay providing the record to the victim until after the convening authority’s action is signed.  If the victim  agrees,  obtain  written  confirmation  of  the  victim’s  decision.    If  the  victim  instead elects  to  receive  the  authenticated  record  of  trial  as  soon  as  it  is  available,  the  convening authority’s  signed  action  shall  be  served  on  the  victim  as  soon  as  it  is  available.    Note:  Ensure records sealed in accordance with RCM 1103A are not provided to the victim.  Also ensure all records provided to the victim are redacted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. 3.6.3.  In a case with an acquittal, in accordance with RCM 1103(e), furnish the victim with the same record provided to the accused: a copy of the convening order (an any amending orders); sufficient information to establish jurisdiction over the accused and the offense, and abbreviated  ROT.    Note:    Ensure  all  records  provided  to  the  victim  are  redacted  in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act.   14  AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009 Chapter 4 ASSEMBLING RECORDS 4.1.  Dividing Records into Volumes. 4.1.1.  Divide ROTs into volumes not to exceed 1 1/2 inches in  thickness.   EXCEPTION:  Cases forwarded for Article 66 review, make the first or only volume of a ROT an inch thick or smaller (after inclusion of SJA Recommendation, clemency matters, and other post-trial documents).  This permits addition of appellate papers to the first volume of records when examined  by  the  Air  Force  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals.    Make  subsequent  volumes  1  ½ inches  thick  or  smaller.    Avoid  assembling  any  volume  that  is  less  than  ½  inch  thick  by adding  pages  to  it  that  would  otherwise  have  been  included  in  preceding  or  subsequent volumes. 4.1.2.  Place like parts of the ROT together in volumes divided by subject, and divide them to meet volume thickness restrictions.  Indicate the contents of the volume on the front cover (e.g., transcript, exhibits, or allied papers).  If the transcript is split into two or more volumes, indicate on the front cover which pages of the transcript are in which volume (e.g., Volume 2 of 4, Transcript, pages 1-300).  Number each volume of the ROT as follows: “Volume 1 of 4.” Assemble the record in accordance with Figure 4.1.  In the upper right-hand corner of the DD Form 490, label the ROT to reflect which copy it is, e.g., “ORIGINAL,” “ACCUSED,” “JAJM-1,” “JAJM-2”, “DEFENSE COUNSEL,” “BASE,” “CONFINEMENT FACILITY.” 4.1.3.  If the trial is lengthy, and the record is larger than three volumes, it is usually best to divide the trial transcript into more than one volume. 4.1.4.  If  the  record  consists  of  sealed  matters,  create  a  volume  to  include  a  cover,  hard backing, and single reference sheet for identification for the additional copies of the record.  Do not include sealed matters in any distributed copies.  They are in the original record of trial only. 4.2.  Dividers.  Use un-tabbed dividers of heavy-stock paper, a different color from the ROT, to make separations in a volume.  Place a label in the lower right corner of the divider identifying the contents under the divider.  Insert dividers as provided in Figure 4.1. 4.3.  Binding  Volumes  of  the  Record  of  Trial.  Bind  the  volumes  at  the  top  to  withstand repeated handling.  Add hard backings to the bottom of each volume (original and copies).  GSA stocks an item which can be used for this purpose: "Blank Paper Lt. Green Press Board, Size 8 1/2 x 11 1/2,."  Use 2-inch capacity Acco-type prong-and-clamp fasteners.   GSA stocks an item that can be used for this purpose:  “Fastener, paper w/compressor 2” capacity.  Place tape over the backs of the fasteners only.  Do not "sew" or "stack" fasteners together to bind thick volumes. 4.4.  Videotapes and Other Recordings.  Package videotapes and other recordings, to include audio tapes, compact discs (CDs), digital video discs (DVDs), and other digital media, in sturdy envelopes, with no more than two videotapes to an envelope.  Bind each envelope as a separate volume of the record and fasten the envelopes to the standard covers using Acco-type fasteners.  Mark each envelope with the accused's full name, social security number, and exhibit number, if applicable.    As  discussed  in  paragraph  9.1,  the  party  offering  a  recording  into  evidence  must prepare  a  description  of  the  recording's  contents  to  serve  as  a  suitable  substitute  in  the  ROT.  AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009   15  Place  on  the  bottom  right  corner  of  the  description,  the  exhibit  number,  page  offered,  page accepted/rejected, and in which volume the recording is placed.  Provide a copy of the recording for each copy of the ROT forwarded to AFLOA/JAJM. 4.5.  Accused’s Copy.  Do not include classified materials, controlled test materials, or matters ordered sealed by the judge in the accused’s copy of the ROT.  Follow the procedures in Chapter 6.  Furthermore, if a ROT contains sexually explicit materials that have not been ordered sealed by the military judge, the following guidance applies to these items: 4.5.1.  Remove  these  items  from  the  accused’s  copy  of  the  ROT  (this  includes  sexually explicit exhibits contained in Article 32 investigations).  In place of the materials, insert a certificate stating the materials were removed due to their sexually explicit content and that the original ROT, which includes the materials, may be inspected at AFLOA/JAJM.  Insert a certificate at each location where such materials are removed. 4.5.2.  Include  these  items  in  the  original  ROT  and  each  copy  of  the  ROT  forwarded  to AFLOA/JAJM.    However,  insert  the  materials,  wherever  located  in  the  ROT,  in  a  sealed opaque  envelope  containing  the  following  label:  “WARNING:    SEXUALLY  EXPLICIT MATERIALS ENCLOSED – NOT ORDERED SEALED BY THE COURT.” 4.6.  Organization  of  Contents  of  Record  of  Trial.  Arrange the contents of the ROT as set forth in Figure 4.1, “Guide for Assembling Records of Trial,” with heavy stock dividers used to separate major components of the records.  To the extent applicable, include signed originals of pertinent documents in the original ROT.  Explain the absence of an original document, and insert  a  certified  true  copy  or  signed  duplicate  original  copy  in  the  ROT.    However,  if  a photocopy  or  data  fax  copy  is  provided  in  lieu  of  the  original  document  for  use  in  the proceedings, including pretrial and post-trial matters, treat the photocopy or data fax copy as an original and place it in the ROT.  This does not apply to the convening authority’s action.  No certification is required.  If attachments are listed on a document, the attachments will remain with the document and be included in the ROT. Figure 4.1.  Guide for Assembling Records of Trial.

Include all Article 39(a) sessions held and a brief description of them.  Pay special attention to noting the pages at which exhibits are offered and accepted/rejected, to include annotating those page numbers on the bottom of an exhibit as appropriate.  If the accused does not receipt for the ROT, ensure the AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009   19  record contains trial counsel’s certificate in lieu of receipt pursuant to RCM 1104(b)(1)(B) or substitute service on defense counsel pursuant to RCM 1104(b)(1)(C).         c.

A  verbatim  transcript  may  be  prepared when RCM 1103(b)(2)(C) authorizes a summarized transcript. 5.2.  Court Reporter Log.  The reporter keeps a log of the opening and closing of all sessions of a  court-martial  such  as  recesses,  adjournments,  Article  39(a)  sessions  and  closed  session deliberations. 5.3.  Oaths  to  Military  Judges,  Court  Members,  Counsel,  Reporters,  Interpreters,  and Witnesses.  It is not necessary to record verbatim the oath actually used.  Record only that the individual took an oath or affirmation.  Recite that the military judge, court members, counsel, reporters, interpreters, and witnesses were sworn (for format, see MCM, Appendices 13 and 14).  For those legal personnel who have previously been administered a one-time oath, indicate in the ROT that they were previously sworn. 5.4.  Article 39(a) Session.  Use the following format for an Article 39(a) session: ARTICLE 39(a) SESSION       [The Article 39(a) session began at 1333 hours, 16 August 2009.  The military judge, trial counsel, defense counsel, accused, and the reporter were present.]   (Verbatim or summarized transcript of entire session.)       [The Article 39(a) session adjourned at 1337 hours, 16 August 2009.]   (Note:  Insert Page Break between Sessions.)       [The court was called back to order at 1338 hours, 16 August 2009, with all necessary parties present, including the court members.]  5.5.  Assembly  of  Court-Martial  after  Termination  of  Initial  Article  39(a)  Session  in  a Member’s  Trial.  In  a  verbatim  transcript,  after  the  initial  Article  39(a)  session  ends,  use  the following format:      MJ:  This Article 39(a) session is adjourned.         [The Article 39(a) session adjourned at 1340 hours, 14 August 2009.]   (Note:  Insert Page Break between Sessions.)  PROCEEDINGS OF THE COURT-MARTIAL       [The court-martial was called to order at 1615 hours, 14 August 2009.]       MJ:  The court-martial will come to order. AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009   29        TC:  This court-martial is convened by...   5.6.  Recess.  Use the following format for a recess:      MJ:  The court-martial will be in recess for 15 minutes.         [The court-martial was recessed at 1645 hours, 14 August 2009.]  (Note: Insert Page Break between Sessions.)       [The court-martial was called back to order at 1700 hours, 14 August 2009, with all parties present who were present when the court-martial recessed.]  5.7.  Reconvening.  Those  portions  of  the  proceedings  in  which  the  military  judge  calls  the court-martial  to  order  and  the  trial  counsel  states  all  parties  to  the  trial  are  present  may  be transcribed verbatim or summarized as shown in paragraph 5.6.  The court reporter must account for the parties.  If trial counsel fails to account for the parties, the reporter notes those present. 5.8.  Court Members.  When a member other than the president speaks, identify the member by the "MBR" abbreviation, abbreviated rank and last name.  For example:  DC:  Does any member of the court-martial know the accused?        MBR (CAPT SMITH):  I do.    If the president of the court-martial is the member speaking, use only the abbreviation "PRES."  5.9.  Voir Dire. 5.9.1.  Note  non-verbal  responses  by  members,  as  a  group  or  individually,  when  the questioning counsel fails to mention it.  For example:      TC:  Does any member know of any reason that would prevent him or her from sitting as a member?        [Negative response by all members.]  5.9.2.  Challenges of Members.  When a challenge against a court member is sustained, show it as follows:      [MBR CAPT SMITH, the challenged member, having been excused by the military judge, withdrew from the courtroom.], or        [The court-martial was called to order at 1700 hours, 14 August 2009, with all parties present, including the members.  MBR CAPT SMITH was not present.]  5.10.  Interrupted Testimony.  The following example shows how to report an interruption.  Questions by Defense Counsel:   CROSS-EXAMINATION   30  AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009      Q.  Mrs.  Wilson, you stated on direct examination that you have known Airman Foster for 3   years and ----       A.  Well, that was give or take a few months either way; I wasn’t being precise on that point.         Q.  ---- and that he had always paid his bills in a rather lax fashion.  What do you have to say about these receipts? (Defense Exhibit B handed to the witness by the defense counsel).          A.  Well, I ---       Q.  You do admit that he paid these on time, at least on a monthly basis, perhaps not on the first of the month, but---        A.  Yes, there was one period when he was prompt with his payments.   5.11.  "Stricken" Portion.  When a trial participant uses the phrase "strike that," transcribe all of the remarks, including the instruction to "strike" part of it.  For example:      Q.  Mr.  Black, did you know it was Mr.  Blue who--strike that--did you know it was Mr Brown who made that statement?.   5.12.  Testimony  through  an  Interpreter.  In  cases  involving  a  witness  speaking  through  an interpreter, transcribe the testimony as if the translation came directly from the witness, except when the interpreter makes a comment clearly not coming from the witness.  Example:      Q.   How long have you been acquainted with Frau Kugler?        A.   Three years.         Q.   What day does Frau Kugler bring in the company receipts for accounting purposes?        A.   Donnerstag.         DC:  Objection, the interpreter should use only English in his translation.         INT:  Excuse me, sir, I mean Thursday. 5.13.  Non-response by a Witness.  Q.   Then there is a doubt in your mind? A.   [No response.] 5.14.  Non-verbal  Responses  and  Gestures.  Some  gestures  by  counsel  or  witnesses  may  be essential to the meaning of oral testimony.  For example, a statement by a witness, "He hit me here," or "I was about this far," does not provide an adequate basis for reviewing authorities to determine what happened at trial.  Counsel and the military judge are primarily responsible for orally describing gestures.  If they fail to do so, the reporter should include a general, factual description, e.g., "He tried to bite me here [witness pointed to the right side of her neck]” or “It was about this far apart [witness held her hands approximately 18 inches apart]." Do not include AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009   31  an  opinion  or  conclusion  in  the  description.    Descriptions,  such  as  "The  witness  appeared surprised," or "She said in a loud, husky voice," are improper. 5.15.  Transcribing  Quotes  into  the  Record.  When  legal  references  and  other  materials  not being offered into evidence or marked for identification are read, place quotation marks around it in the transcript.  Include the correct spelling and citation of the material.  Lengthy material may be offered as an appellate exhibit. 5.16.  Excusing  Witnesses  from  the  Courtroom.  Annotate  the  military  judge’s  excusal  of witnesses from the courtroom as follows:      [The witness, after being instructed not to discuss his testimony, was excused and left the courtroom subject to recall.]   NOTE:   If the witness was not instructed by the military judge regarding discussing his testimony, do not include that portion of the standard entry.  If the witness was not held subject to recall, do not include that portion of the standard instruction.  Summarize what instructions were given to the witness.   5.17.  Closing and Reopening the Court-Martial.  For example:      MJ:  The court-martial will be closed.         [The court-martial closed at 1845 hours, 14 August 2009.]   (Note: Insert Page Break between Sessions.)       [The court-martial opened again at 2005 hours, 14 August 2009, with all parties present who were present when the court-martial closed.]   If, while the court-martial is closed, the military judge convenes an Article 39(a) session, annotate the session immediately after the date and time the court-martial closed.  See paragraph 5.4.   5.18.  Reporter Reads the Record.  If the military judge directs the reporter to read a portion of the record from the notes, or replay a portion of the recorded session, transcribe it as follows: "The reporter read the portion of the proceedings between page __, line __ and page __, line __, at the direction of the military judge." 5.19.  Miscellaneous Examples for Summarized Transcripts.  The following are examples of summaries of standard parts of trial for use in summarized transcripts.  These are examples only and  the  court  reporter  should  take  care  to  summarize  what  actually  took  place  in  the  court-martial being transcribed and not substitute these examples. 5.19.1.  Explanation of Stipulation of Fact to the Accused. The military judge explained to the accused and ascertained that the accused understood the meaning and effect of the Stipulation of Fact, Prosecution Exhibit ___ for ID, and that the accused consented to its use as evidence by the court.  The military judge further stated that the Stipulation of Fact would be used to determine the providence of the guilty plea.  Prosecution ___ for ID was admitted into evidence, subject to the acceptance of the guilty plea.     32  AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009 5.19.2.  Post-Trial and Appellate Rights. The military judge advised the accused of his post-trial and appellate rights.  Appellate Exhibit ___ was provided by the defense counsel.  It consisted of written advice, signed by the accused and defense counsel advising the accused of his post-trial and appellate rights.   5.19.3.  Stipulation of Expected Testimony. The Stipulation of Expected Testimony was marked as Appellate Exhibit ___.  The military judge explained to the accused and ascertained that the accused understood the meaning and effect of the Stipulation of Expected Testimony.  The accused consented to the use of the Stipulation of Expected Testimony.   5.19.4.  Accused’s Request that Defense Counsel Argue for a Bad Conduct Discharge. Appellate Exhibit ___ was marked and provided to the military judge.  The military judge explained to the accused and ascertained that the accused understood the meaning and effect of his request that his counsel argue for a bad conduct discharge.  After extensive questioning of the accused, the military judge found that the accused made a knowing and intelligent decision to have the defense counsel argue for a bad conduct discharge.  The military judge granted permission for such an argument. 5.19.5.  Pretrial Agreement. The military judge ascertained that there was a pretrial agreement in this case.  The pretrial agreement was marked as Appellate Exhibit ___, and Appendix A thereto was marked as Appellate Exhibit ___.  The military judge inquired into and ensured that the accused fully understood the entire agreement and was satisfied with its terms; that he understood the meaning and effect of his pleas and desired to plead guilty; that the agreement was in substantial compliance with the requirements of the applicable regulations and law; that it was not contrary to public policy and the military judge’s notion of fairness; and that the parties agreed to its terms.   5.19.6.  Acceptance of a Guilty Plea. The military judge announced that each guilty plea of the accused was found to have been voluntarily made with the full knowledge of its meaning and effect and, specifically, that the accused knowingly and consciously waived his rights against self-incrimination, to a trial of the facts by a court-martial, and to be confronted by and to cross-examine the witnesses against him.  The military judge found the pleas of guilty to be voluntary and that they had an adequate factual basis.  The military judge accepted the guilty pleas.   5.19.7.  Sentence Limitation of a Pretrial Agreement. The military judge examined Appellate Exhibit ____, Appendix A to the pretrial agreement.  The military judge questioned the accused with regard to the sentence to be approved by the convening authority and determined that the accused understood it.  Thereafter, the military judge stated that he found Appendix A to comply with public policy and the law; that it was not ambiguous in its terms; and that it did not deny the accused his right to due process.   5.20.  Certificate  of  Correction.  A  ROT  that  is  found  to  be  incomplete  or  in  error  may  be corrected after authentication.  A certificate of correction may be completed by the court reporter and authenticated by the military judge.  RCM 1104(d) and MCM, Appendix 14, set forth the AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009   33  procedure  and  provides  the  format  for  a  certificate  of  correction.    Place  it  in  the  ROT immediately before the Action of the Convening Authority.  (See Figure 4.1)   34  AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009 Chapter 6 CLASSIFIED, CONTROLLED TEST AND SEALED MATERIALS IN THE ROT 6.1.  Procedures  for  Classified  Materials.  Trial  counsel  and  court  reporter  must  ensure  they are familiar with procedures for safeguarding and handling classified documents, tapes, the ROT, and all associated materials.  Transcribe classified portions of a ROT on a computer designated for classified use only.  When a ROT contains classified material that cannot be declassified, the ROT, or portions thereof, must be classified.  Refer to AFPD 31-4, Information Security, and AFI  31-401,  Information  Security  Program  Management,  to  determine  whether  a  particular record must be classified.  Ensure the appropriate classified cover sheet is placed over the top of any  classified  volume.    Handle  and  protect  classified  materials,  to  include  court  reporting equipment and other media used to compile the ROT, in accordance with current directives for such materials.  Consult your unit security manager prior to any proceeding or activity involving classified materials. 6.1.1.  Classified Testimony.  Trial counsel notifies the court reporter of the beginning and termination  of  each  classified  portion  of  testimony.    Transcribe  these  portions  on  separate pages  and  assemble  them  under  separate  cover.    Annotate  in  the  unclassified  ROT,  at  the place where the  classified testimony occurred, the pages containing classified information, the classification of those pages, and the fact that they are bound under separate cover. 6.1.2.  Classified Materials.  Include classified materials in the original record of trial only, with a copy maintained at the office of the servicing staff judge advocate in case the original is lost in the mail.  All other copies, including the accused’s copy, shall be expurgated copies of the record of trial with the classified information deleted or withdrawn and a certificate inserted in its place.  (See RCM 1104).  The certificate informs the accused that the complete ROT,  including  the  classified  material,  may  be  examined  in  the  Office  of  The  Judge Advocate  General  under  such  conditions  as  AFLOA/JAJM  may  prescribe,  consistent  with RCM 1104(b)(1)(D)(iii). 6.2.  Procedures  for  Controlled  Test  Materials.  Safeguard  and  protect  controlled  test materials  from  further  disclosure  or  unauthorized  access.    Controlled  test  materials  include promotion  testing  materials,  professional  military  education  test  materials,  and  career development course exams.  AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System, requires the safeguarding of controlled test materials in accordance with the applicable provisions of AFI 31-401. 6.2.1.  Label the DD Form 490 and each page containing controlled test material as follows: CONTROLLED TEST MATERIAL SPECIAL HANDLING REQUIRED  6.2.2.  Assemble all controlled test materials in a separate volume of the ROT.  Insert a sheet of  paper  in  the  ROT  where  each  exhibit  or  testimony  containing  controlled  test  materials would  otherwise  be  located  with  an  annotation  identifying  the  volume  in  which  these materials are actually located. AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009   35  6.2.3.  Place controlled testing materials in a stout, opaque envelope, sealed completely with strapping tape.  The envelope should be annotated “CONTROLLED TEST MATERIALS – SPECIAL  HANDLING  REQUIRED.    SEALED  PURSUANT  TO  AFMAN  51-203, CHAPTER  6  AND  AFI  36-2605.”  If  the  military  judge  also  ordered  the  controlled  test materials to be sealed, add to the annotation “ORDERED SEALED BY THE MILITARY JUDGE, ROT PAGE(S)___.” 6.2.4.  Place controlled test materials in the original ROT only, with a copy maintained by the office of the servicing staff judge advocate in case the original is lost in the mail.  Do not include controlled test materials in the accused’s copy and other copies of the ROT.  In these copies, insert a certificate in place of the controlled test materials.  The certificate informs the accused (and others) that the controlled test materials have been withdrawn, that the complete record is kept at AFLOA/JAJM, and that it may be examined under such conditions as the record custodian prescribes. 6.3.  Procedures for Sealed Materials.  The term “sealed materials” is defined as those items, other than classified and controlled test materials, that a military judge, in the interest of justice, orders  sealed  in  the  ROT.    Sealed  materials  may  include  testimony,  exhibits,  and  pretrial documents (e.g., exhibits to Article 32 investigations).  Sealed materials will typically involve contraband  materials,  such  as  sexually  explicit  pictures,  or  matters  involving  a  high  privacy interest, such as sensitive victim photographs or testimony. 6.3.1.  Military judges, on their own initiative, may order that specified materials in a ROT be sealed.  In addition, when ROTs will contain matters for which sealing is appropriate, trial counsel  should  ask  the  military  judge  to  order  those  matters  sealed  in  the  ROT.    Matters ordered sealed by the military judge should also be labeled as appellate exhibits and included in the ROT.   A summarized ROT should address the sealing action in a general sense that conveys the topic of the sealing and decision of the Court rather than the particulars sealed (e.g., if motions and testimony are sealed, discuss the decision of the Court in generalities). 6.3.2.  Label the DD Form 490 and each page containing sealed materials as follows: SEALED MATERIALS  SPECIAL HANDLING REQUIRED 6.3.3.  Place matters ordered sealed by the military judge in a stout, opaque envelope, sealed completely  with  strapping  tape.    The  envelope  should  be  annotated  "SEALED  ITEM  – SPECIAL  HANDLING  REQUIRED.    SEALED  BY  MILITARY  JUDGE,  ROT  PAGE(S) __." If the sealed matters are too bulky to be included with the other appellate exhibits, create a separate volume for them and insert a sheet of paper in the ROT stating where the sealed matters are located.  For example: SEALED MATTERS   Appellate Exhibit ___ was ordered sealed by the military judge, ROT page ___.  It is to remain sealed and opened only by order of the court.  Appellate Exhibit ___ is found in Volume ___ of ___.   6.3.4.  Place sealed matters in the original ROT only, with a copy maintained by the office of the  servicing  staff  judge  advocate  in  case  the  original  is  lost  in  the  mail.    Do  not  include   36  AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009 sealed materials in the accused's copy and other copies of the ROT.  Withdraw the sealed materials and insert a certificate informing the accused and others that the complete record is kept  at  AFLOA/JAJM  and  that  it  may  be  examined  under  such  conditions  as  the  record custodian prescribes. AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009   37  Chapter 7 ABBREVIATED RECORDS OF TRIAL 7.1.  Preparing  Abbreviated  ROTs.  The  abbreviated  ROT  consists  of  the  items  listed  in Figure 7.1 and RCM 1103(e).  Prepare abbreviated ROTs for the following GCMs and SPCMs: 7.1.1.  Those resulting in an acquittal of all charges and specifications; 7.1.2.  Those  resulting  in  a  finding  of  not  guilty  of  all  charges  and  specifications  only  by reason of lack of mental responsibility; and 7.1.3.  Those terminated by withdrawal, mistrial, or dismissal before findings. Figure 7.1. GUIDE FOR ASSEMBLING ABBREVIATED RECORDS OF TRIAL  1.  DD Form 490 - Front Cover.   2.

Preparing Summarized ROTs.  A summarized ROT is a ROT that contains a summarized report  of  the  proceedings  authorized  under  RCM  1103(b)(2)(C).    The  summarized  report  of proceedings must accurately reflect the substance of all the proceedings and must be sufficiently detailed and complete to permit resolution of any contested factual or legal issue upon review (See MCM, Appendix 13).  Include a more detailed summary of Article 39(a) sessions held to discuss instructions for findings.  If instructions are altered, added or omitted between what is agreed to during the Article 39(a) session and the actual delivery to the members, note that in a summary.  Attachment  2 is a sample summarized report of proceedings.  ROTs containing a summarized  report  of  proceedings  should  be  assembled  in  accordance  with  the  guidance  in Figure 4.1 8.2.  Verbatim  Portions.  The following parts of a summarized report of proceedings must be verbatim: 8.2.1.  Findings on the jurisdictional basis for prosecution of the offenses, if any; 8.2.2.  Findings; 8.2.3.  Sentence; 8.2.4.  Any  other  verbatim  portions  requested  by  reviewers  (SJA,  counsel,  military  judge, etc.). 8.3.  Video or Audio Recordings.  When an audio or video recording is introduced at trial, the ROT  may  include  a  verbatim  transcript  of  the  material  played  before  the  court,  or,  at  the discretion of the military judge, the material on the tape or disc may be summarized.  If a video is silent, the party offering the video evidence should describe what is depicted on the recording.  Attach  the  tape  or  disc  of  the  recording  that  was  introduced  at  trial  to  the  original  ROT forwarded to AFLOA/JAJM.  Attach a copy of the recording to the copy of the ROT maintained by the convening authority’s SJA. 8.4.  Other  Magnetic  or  Digital  Media.  If  evidence  consisting  of  the  contents  of  other magnetic or digital media (e.g., tapes of any kind, CDs, DVDs, cellular phones, computer hard drives,  or  any  other  recording  device  introduced  at  trial),  the  party  offering  the  medium  must prepare a written summary of the contents offered as an exhibit.  This may be simply a list of sub-directories  and  files  or  the  contents  of  a  text  message,  for  example.    Attach  the  medium offered at trial (if it is a tape or a disc) and the summary to the ROT as an exhibit.  The military judge  may  authorize  substitution  of  exact  copies  of  the  contents  of  large  media,  such  as  the contents of a hard drive.  Attach copies of all media made part of the original ROT to the copy of the ROT retained by the convening authority’s SJA. 8.5.  Summarized  Voir  Dire.  Individual  Voir  Dire.    Summarize  the  individual  voir  dire  of  a court member whose challenge for cause was denied by the military judge (see Appendix 13, MCM). AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009   39  Chapter 9 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR VERBATIM RECORDS 9.1.  Video  or  Audio  Recordings.  When  an  audio  or  video  recording  is  introduced  at  trial, include  a  verbatim  transcript  of  the  material  played  before  the  court  in  the  ROT.    It  is  the responsibility of the party offering the recording to prepare a summary of the scene and action depicted for the ROT.  Attach the tape or disc of the recording that was introduced at trial to the original ROT as an exhibit and a copy of the recording to each copy of the ROT forwarded to AFLOA/JAJM.    Also  attach  a  copy  of  the  recording  to  the  copy  of  the  ROT  retained  by  the convening authority’s SJA. 9.2.  Other  Magnetic  or  Digital  Media.  If  evidence  consisting  of  the  contents  of  other magnetic or digital media (e.g., tapes of any kind, CDs, DVDs, cellular phones, computer hard drives,  or  any  other  recording  device  introduced  at  trial),  include  a  verbatim  transcript  of  the material introduced at trial in the ROT.  If the material is graphic, summarize the description of the  material.    The  party  who  offers  the  medium  prepares  a  summary  of  the  contents  of  the medium  offered  as  an  exhibit.    This  may  be  simply  a  list  of  sub-directories  and  files  or  the contents of a text message, for example.  Attach the medium offered at trial (if it is a tape or a disc)  and  the  summary  to  the  original  ROT  as  an  exhibit.    The  military  judge  may  authorize substitution of exact copies of the contents of large media, such as the contents of a hard drive.  Attach copies of all media made part of the original ROT to the copy of the ROT retained by the convening authority’s SJA. 9.3.  Instructions.  Include  the  full  text  of  the  instructions  given  by  the  military  judge  or president in the ROT.  Parenthetical entries, such as "[The military judge read Appellate Exhibit I to the court.]" are not adequate.   40  AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009 Chapter 10 RECORDS OF TRIAL FOR SUMMARY COURTS-MARTIAL 10.1.  DD Form 2329.  Use DD Form 2329, Record of Trial by Summary Court-Martial, as the ROT in all summary courts-martial (SCM) (See Appendix 15, MCM).  A complete SCM ROT shall include a DD Form 490 as the front cover, the DD Form 2329, along with the following documents: Convening Order, Charge Sheet with First Indorsement, Accused’s Receipt for ROT, Action Memorandum, Clemency Submissions, Notice of Post-Trial Submissions, Exhibits, and other Allied Papers.  An original and three copies of the DD Form 2329 are required pursuant to paragraph 3.5 of this manual. 10.2.  Numbering.  Number each SCM ROT at the top right corner of the DD Form 2329 and the top right corner of the first page of the ROT (the DD Form 490 cover page).  SCM ROTs should be numbered serially in the order in which received for action.  Use a number consisting of the first three letters of the name of the base where the case was tried, the last two digits of the year and the number of the court.  (For example, BOL, 11-1, indicates the first SCM at Bolling AFB in 2011.)  Do not just “JB” as part of your numbering system unless the next letter in the code will uniquely identify your base.  For instance JBA could be Joint-Base Andrews, Arnold, or Andersen.  Use codes like AND, ARN, or GUA instead. 10.3.  Authentication.  The  ROT  is  authenticated  by  having  the  having  the  officer  detailed  to serve as the summary court-martial sign each copy of the DD Form 2329. 10.4.  Service of ROT and Post-Trial Submissions.  As soon as the ROT (DD Form 2329) is authenticated, serve a copy upon the accused and obtain a receipt (see MCM, Appendix 14, for format of receipt).  If a copy of the ROT cannot be served on the accused, serve it on the defense counsel and attach to the ROT an explanation as to why it cannot be served on the accused.  The accused may submit written matters to the convening authority in accordance with RCM 1105.  Add  such  matters  to  the  original  and  each  copy  of  the  ROT  (except  for  the  copy  previously served upon the accused). 10.5.  Convening Authority Action.  Show the action of the convening authority on each copy of the DD Form 2329, except the copy previously served upon the accused, and distribute the action to the accused, defense counsel, the SCM officer, the accused’s immediate commander, the local Military Personnel Flight (MPF), the local Finance Office, and the confinement facility, as  appropriate.    If  at  all  possible  and  space  permits,  include  the  convening  authority’s  action directly on the DD Form 2329 so that a separate document is not necessary.  A promulgating order is not necessary unless the case results in a full acquittal or in cases where there is an error in the convening authority’s initial action.  See RCM 1306(b)(4). 10.6.  Post Action Review.  After convening authority action, forward the original and one copy of  the  ROT  to  the  staff  judge  advocate  for  the  general  court-martial  convening  authority  for review under Article 64(a), UCMJ.  The Article 64(a) review should be annotated on each copy of the DD Form 2329 and on the front cover (DD Form 490).  Upon completion, the original ROT containing the original DD Form 2329 should be forwarded to AFLOA/JAJM.  Copies of the DD Form 2329 containing the Article 64(a) review are distributed, to the extent practical, in accordance with AFI 51-201, Figure 10.9 and paragraph 11.4.4. AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009   41  Chapter 11 RECORDS OF GCMS OR SPCMS TERMINATED BY MISTRIAL, DISMISSAL OF ALL CHARGES OR OTHERWISE TERMINATED WITHOUT FINDINGS 11.1.  Retrial Intended.  If the accused may be retried on the same or corrected charges, prepare a verbatim ROT to the point of termination, authenticate it, and serve a copy on the accused.  Attach the ROT of the first proceeding to the ROT of the second proceeding. 11.2.  Retrial Not Intended.  If the accused will not be retried on the same or corrected charges, prepare the ROT in the same manner as an acquittal.  See Chapter 7 and RCM 1103(e). 11.3.  Cases Not Tried.  When there is an Article 32 investigation and no court-martial follows, dispose  of  the  report  of  investigation  in  accordance  with  the  Air  Force  Records  Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).   42  AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009 Chapter 12 AUTHENTICATING GCM AND SPCM ROTS 12.1.  Authentication of Record and Trial Counsel’s Certificate of Review.  Authenticate the ROT in accordance with RCM 1104.  Before forwarding the ROT to the military judge or court reporter  for  authentication,  trial  counsel  or  assistant  trial  counsel  must  examine  the  ROT  for accuracy.  Trial counsel or assistant trial counsel (whichever one examines the ROT) shall sign a certificate to evidence the fact that such an examination was accomplished.  See Figure 12.1 for a suggested format for the authentication of record, including trial counsel’s certificate of review. 12.2.  Court  Reporter.  With  the  prior  approval  of  the  military  judge,  the  court  reporter  may authenticate  the  ROT  of  a  SPCM  in  which  a  BCD,  confinement  for  more  than  6  months,  or forfeiture of pay for more than six months was not adjudged.  See RCM 1104(a)(2)(A). 12.3.  Substitution  of  Military  Judge  or  Court  Reporter.  If  a  substitution  of  the  military judge or court reporter occurs during the trial, each individual authenticates that portion of the ROT concerning proceedings at which the authenticator was present.   Indicate the pages of the ROT covered by the authentication of each above the authenticator's signature.  In the event the military judge is unavailable to authenticate the ROT, see RCM 1104. 12.4.  Forwarding  the  ROT  Without  the  Article  32  Investigation.  The  ROT  of  a  GCM  or SPCM may be sent to the military judge for authentication without the Article 32 investigation report and allied papers, unless those documents were introduced at trial as exhibits. 12.5.  AF  IMT  135,  Corrections  to  Record  of  Trial.  Include  this  errata  sheet  with  ROTs forwarded to the military judge so the military judge can annotate the location and wording of any necessary corrections. 12.6.  Correcting Errors in ROTs. 12.6.1.  ROTs  may  not  be  authenticated  "subject  to  correction."  Correct  errors  before authentication.  Except as provided in RCM 1104(d), do not retype a page in a ROT after authentication. 12.6.2.  Minor corrections, misspellings, punctuation, and similar corrections may be made on  the  original  copy  of  the  record  in  pen  or  typewriter.    The  authenticator  making  the correction initials next to the correction.  For major corrections requiring an entire page to be retyped,  the  authenticator,  if  other  than  the  court  reporter,  contacts  the  court  reporter  and indicates the needed changes.  The reporter types a new page with the corrections and sends it to the authenticator.  If it becomes necessary to insert additional pages, number them as described in paragraph 1.8.1 12.6.3.  After receiving the original authenticated ROT from the military judge, photocopy the  errata  sheet  (AF  IMT  135),  any  pages  with  changes,  and  substitute  them  for  the corresponding  uncorrected  pages  in  each  copy  of  the  ROT.    The  pages  with  corrections cannot be retyped after authentication.  The corrected pages must remain part of the ROT. 12.6.4.  After authentication, the court reporter ensures all copies of the ROT are complete and identical to the original authenticated ROT.  The AF IMT 135 is placed in the ROT as shown in Figure 4.1 AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009   43  12.7.  Examination by Defense Counsel. 12.7.1.  Except  when  unreasonable  delay  will  result,  trial  counsel  shall  permit  the  defense counsel to examine the ROT before authentication.  Although examination of the ROT by defense counsel is not a part of the authentication, it is desirable that the ROT reflect defense counsel  review.    After  examination  of  the  record,  defense  counsel  should  complete  a certificate  of  examination  using  the  format  in  Figure  12.1    When  defense  counsel  is  not given  the  opportunity  to  examine  the  record  before  authentication,  the  reasons  should  be attached to the record.  See RCM 1103(i)(1)(B) and Appendix 14, MCM.  The reasons can be provided in a certificate signed by the trial counsel. 12.7.2.  Defense  counsel  is  entitled  to  respond  to  the  recommendation  of  the  SJA  and  to submit an Article 38(c), UCMJ, brief.  Provide a copy of the ROT to the defense counsel responsible for clemency matters (as determined on the record by the military judge) no later than the date defense counsel is served the SJA’s recommendations (RCM 1106(f)).  Earlier transmittal is desirable.  Defense counsel may retain this copy until submission of the RCM 1106(f)(4) response.  If the copy is provided to defense counsel before authentication, furnish copies of any corrected pages and the AF IMT 135, which have been otherwise corrected, on or before the date of service of the SJA’s recommendations.  Defense counsel must return this copy of the ROT and corrected pages to the SJA of the command taking action not later than the time to submit the RCM 1106(f)(4) response to the SJA. 12.8.  Accused’s Copy.  Give each person tried by court-martial a copy of the ROT, except for any classified materials, controlled test materials, sealed materials, or sexually explicit materials (see  paragraph  4.5).      Indicate  disposition  of  the  accused's  copy  of  the  ROT  in  the  original.  Accomplish this in the “Copies of Record” section of Figure 4.2 12.9.  Prisoners.  Ensure  that  prisoners  receive  their  copy  of  the  ROT.    SJAs  should  advise Security Forces to establish procedures to counsel prisoners on the importance of the ROT and its retention.  Transfer the ROT with prisoners as personal property. 12.10.  Delivery Impossible.  If a copy of the record cannot be delivered to the accused, give it to the defense counsel or forward it with the original record with an explanation of the reason for non-delivery.   RCM 1104(b).

Cases Reviewed Under Article 66, UCMJ.  Forward the original ROT and two copies to AFLOA/  JAJM.    Article  66,  UCMJ  review  is  required  for  cases  in  which  the  sentence,  as approved, extends to death, dismissal of a commissioned officer (or cadet), dishonorable or bad conduct discharge, or confinement for one year or more, and, except in the case of a sentence extending to death, the right to appellate review has not been waived or an appeal has not been withdrawn.  If special software is required to view any exhibit, the legal office must also provide a copy of the software and user license when forwarding the ROT.  The preferred format is wfm viewer software. 13.2.  Cases Where Appellate Review is Waived or Withdrawn.  Forward the original ROT only to AFLOA/JAJM. 13.3.  Cases  Reviewed  Under  Article  69,  UCMJ.  Send  only to AFLOA/JAJM  for  the  Article  69,  UCMJ  examination.    An  Article  69,  UCMJ  examination  is required for each general court-martial that is not otherwise reviewed under Article 66 if there is a finding of guilty and the accused does not waive or withdraw his right to appellate review.  The convening authority’s staff judge advocate retains one copy of the ROT at least until notified that post-trial examination is completed and the proceedings are final under Article 76, UCMJ.  If TJAG directs review of the case by the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals, AFLOA/JAJM will request two additional copies of the ROT from the convening authority.  If special software is required to view any exhibit, the legal office must also provide a copy of the software and user license when forwarding the ROT. 13.4.  Remands.  If the original ROT is reviewed under Article 66 or 67, UCMJ, and is returned to a convening authority for a new action, always return the original ROT, the original and two copies of the new action, 10 copies of the new promulgating order, and two copies of the new SJA's Recommendation, if applicable, to AFLOA/JAJM. 13.5.  SPCMs with BCD Not Approved by the Convening Authority.  Forward the original ROT to AFLOA/JAJM after the GCM SJA completes the Article 64, UCMJ review. 13.6.  Method  of  Forwarding  ROTs.  Send  ROTs  by  a  means  that  ensures  some  way  of tracking it if lost.  Forwarding ROTs to AFLOA/JAJM by overnight mail is rarely necessary.   Ensure  the  ROT  is  packaged  securely  to  safeguard  against  the  record  coming  apart  during shipment.    Use  of  bubble  wrap  or  some  other  similar  single-piece  packing  material  is recommended.    Do  not  use  Styrofoam  “popcorn,”  shredded  paper,  or  other  loose  materials  as packing  material.    Use  appropriate  size  boxes  and  indicate  if  the  ROT  is  being  shipped  in multiple boxes (e.g., “Box 1 of 2”).   Do not put too many volumes in one box as this may make the boxes too heavy for one person to lift.  Box weight should be limited to 20 pounds. 13.7.  Disposition.  Refer to the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule in AFRIMS for ROT disposition instructions. 13.8.  Electronic  Trial  Transcripts.  In  addition  to  forwarding  the  authenticated  ROT,  the electronic version from which the unsealed, unclassified authenticated trial transcript was printed will be saved from Word into a searchable Portable Document Format (PDF) file and uploaded   46  AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009 by the court reporter to FLITE in a secure electronic repository established by AFLOA/JAS for trial  transcripts.    A  searchable  PDF  file  allows  key  word  searches  within  a  stable  format  that prevents inadvertent changes.  Court reporters must not manually scan the trial transcript into a PDF  format  because  doing  so  would  be  unnecessarily  time  consuming  and  would  result  in  a large, unsearchable document.  Electronic trial transcripts uploaded to FLITE will be named by year,  base,  and  case  name  (e.g.,  “2009-Barksdale-A1C  William  Johnson”)  so  that  appellate counsel and other Air Force personnel may access the files for official purposes.  The location of the secure FLITE repository and any special instructions will be provided to the field through AFLOA/JAJM.   If the FLITE repository is not available, court reporters are permitted to send the electronic trial transcript via encrypted email to authorized personnel for official purposes.   Personnel  who  use  the  electronic  trial  transcript  as  an  aid  to  their  official  duties  must  always check its contents against the authenticated ROT, which is the only official Air Force record of the proceedings. AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009   47  Chapter 14 RETURN OF EXHIBITS TO RIGHTFUL OWNERS 14.1.  Generally.  Normally,  property  involved  in  courts-martial  cannot  be  returned  until  after appellate review.  Return all property involved in courts-martial or investigations to the owners as  soon  as  possible,  unless  ownership  is  contested  or  the  evidence  is  contraband.    An  owner, including  the  accused,  does  not  lose  ownership  or  right  to  possession  of  property  used  as evidence in a court-martial.  If feasible, considering the potential for rehearings, make copies, descriptions, or photographs of the evidence for the ROT and return the property to the owners.  If property that is made part of the ROT cannot be returned to the owner before completion of appellate review, attach a letter to the ROT from the installation SJA, through the GCM SJA to AFLOA/JAJM, requesting the return of the property to the command concerned or directly to specified  persons  after  the  sentence  becomes  final.    As  used  in  this  paragraph,  "contraband" means any property clearly made subject to confiscation or forfeiture by a U.S. statute or a state or foreign law. 14.2.  Conflicting Claims.  Courts-martial cannot adjudicate title to property.  Where more than one  person  claims  the  property,  the  SJA  should  attempt  to  resolve  the  matter  among  the claimants.  If the claimants cannot agree, dispose of the property according to the ruling of the appropriate  civil  court.    Aside  from  acting  as  temporary  custodian  of  the  property,  tell  the claimants of the Air Force’s position in the matter and suggest they seek a remedy in civil court.   48  AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009 Chapter 15 PREPARING AND ASSEMBLING ARTICLE 32 REPORTS 15.1.  Appointment of Article 32 Investigating Officer (IO).  The appointment of the Article 32  IO  is  done  as  a  separate  letter.    Letterhead  may  be  used.    The  appointment  letter  is  never marked as an exhibit to the IO’s report. 15.2.  Report.  Use  DD  Form  457,  Investigating  Officer’s  Report,  to  prepare  the  report.    Use additional sheets of plain bond paper to complete the report if necessary.  The IO’s report is the first indorsement to the IO’s appointment letter.  See AFI 51-201, paragraph 4.1.13. 15.3.  Exhibits.  Include a list of exhibits in the report, but do not mark the exhibits list as an IO Exhibit. 15.3.1.  A copy of the DD Form 458, Charge Sheet, is always IO Exhibit Number 1.  Never mark the original charge sheet as an IO exhibit. 15.3.2.  Each page of an IO exhibit should be numbered for the ease of reviewing the report.   For example, the first page of IO Exhibit Number 5 should be numbered “IO Ex No.  5, page 1 of ___” and the second page should be numbered “IO Ex No. 5 page 2 of ___” and so forth throughout the document.  If the document is printed on the front and backside of the page, number each side as a separate page. 15.3.3.  A  stamp  should  be  available  to  the  IO  for  the  purpose  of  marking  exhibits.    The stamp should read “IO.  Ex No.  ___.” Exhibits should be marked in the bottom right corner of  the  page  if  possible.    Follow  the  same  procedures  for  IO  exhibits  as  are  required  for exhibits contained in the ROT when insufficient space at the bottom right corner for marking exists.  Refer to paragraph 1.10.5 AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009   49  Chapter 16 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COURT REPORTER 16.1.  Generally.  The primary duty of the court reporter is to record verbatim all sessions of any proceeding to which he or she is detailed, and to accurately transcribe and assemble court-martial records,  Article  32  Investigations,  DuBay  hearings,  contingency  confinement  hearings, proceedings in revision,  courts of inquiry,  and other proceedings as required.  Court reporters will be used in all GCMs and SPCMs. 16.2.  Neutrality of Court Reporter.  The court reporter is to remain neutral in any proceedings to which detailed.  The court reporter must refrain from expressing personal opinions about the case before, during, or after trial.  Counsel should provide court reporters a list of witnesses and a list of exhibits before trial.  Court reporters must not share information received from one party with the other party in any proceeding to which the reporter is detailed.  This includes witness lists  and  exhibit  lists  provided  to  the  reporter  in  advance  of  trial  to  assist  in  the  reporter’s preparation. 16.3.  Court Reporter Recesses.  The court reporter should inform the military judge if feeling ill or fatigued so either a recess or a replacement court reporter, as appropriate, may be arranged. 16.4.  Interruption of Proceedings.  When anything interferes with the court reporter’s ability to record the proceedings verbatim, the reporter must bring this to the attention of the military judge immediately.  This includes the inability to hear the person who is speaking, or equipment malfunction.    The  court  reporter  must  check  the  equipment  periodically  to  ensure  it  is functioning properly. 16.5.  Court  Reporter  Tapes.  The  use  of  cassette  recording  is  prohibited  except  in  cases  of emergency  where  digital  means  of  recording  are  unavailable.      If  cassette  recorders  are  used, court reporters should label tapes used to record the proceedings with the accused’s last name, type of proceeding, and date.  Number the tapes for each proceeding starting at 1.  Tapes should be labeled and numbered in advance of trial.  For example: “Smith - 1 - GCM - 14 Aug 09.” Back-up tapes should be labeled as follows: “Smith - 1 B/U -GCM - 14 Aug 09.”  If more than one reporter is detailed to a case, the reporter should initial the tapes he or she uses. 16.6.  Exhibits.  Court reporters should ensure that they have all of the exhibits at the close of trial. 16.7.  Court Reporter Checklist.  Court reporters should use a checklist to ensure all tasks are completed.  Figure 16.1 is a sample checklist.  Court reporters should also maintain a log of all proceedings  to  which  the  court  reporter  is  detailed.    The  use  of  computer  generated  logs  is preferred. 16.8.  Court  Reporter  Attestation.  The  detailed  court  reporter  is  ultimately  responsible  for attesting to the quality and authenticity of the transcript.  Even when the record is transcribed by another court reporter, the detailed court reporter must still review the record for accuracy and sign an attestation (Figure 16.2) to be inserted in the record after the court reporter chronology. 16.9.  Methods  of  Reporting.  Digital  recording  will  be  used  as  the  primary  method  of recording; stenotype may also be used, however, digital is preferred.  Court reporters are also authorized to use stenomask (closed microphone), stenomask with computer aided transcription,   50  AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009 stenotype with computer aided transcription, and open microphone to record any proceeding to which they are detailed.  Court reporters must use both a primary and backup system to ensure a record can be accurately prepared.  The backup method for stenotype reporting will be digital recording. 16.9.1.  Special  Rules  for  Open  Microphone  Reporting.   Court  reporters  reporting proceedings using the open microphone method of reporting must adhere to the following procedures in addition to the requirements included elsewhere in this manual. 16.9.1.1.  Monitor the recording at all times by using the headset to ensure the proceeding is being recorded verbatim.  If there is noise that prevents the reporter from hearing what is on the recording or a person is not speaking loudly enough for the recorder to pick up what is being said, interrupt the proceedings to inform the military judge of the problem immediately.  This will ensure that a recording is made of everything being said. 16.9.1.2.  If  using  a  cassette  recorder,  make  sure  the  equipment  is  properly  set  up  to record  by  open  microphone.    Set  the  recorder  counter  to  “0”  at  the  beginning  of  the proceeding and each time the tape is changed.  Label the tapes as described in paragraph 16.5 16.9.1.3.  Take detailed notes of what transpires during the course of the trial, by hand or on  a  laptop.    For  each  item  noted  when  recording  on  a  cassette  recorder,  record  the counter  number  and  tape  number  for  easy  accessibility  later.    This  will  aid  the  court reporter if asked to play back some part of the proceedings.  If using digital recording and computerized notes, the notes will be automatically time-stamped to allow for easy play back.    Make  a  note  of  any  gestures  made  by  counsel  or  a  witness  whether  or  not described on the record.  Also note case cites and terms with which the reporter is not familiar  to  check  the  spelling  at  a  recess.    Note  the  following  list  of  items  is  not  all inclusive: The opening and closing times of all open sessions, all Article 39 (a) sessions, recesses, closing and opening for deliberations, and adjournment;   The detailing of counsel and counsel qualifications;   The detailing of the military judge;   Rights to counsel explained to the accused;   Nature of the charges;   Opportunity to challenge military judge;   Explanation of choice of forum to accused;   Arraignment;   Motions;   AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009   51  Pleas;   Explanation of guilty plea;   Maximum punishment authorized;   Elements of the offense;   Care inquiry;   Pretrial agreement, if any;   Announcement of findings;   Members called;   Swearing in of court members;   Assembly of court-martial;   Preliminary instructions to members;   Voir dire, en banc and individual;   Challenges;  Members informed of accused’s pleas;  Distribution of charges to the members;  Opening statements;  The calling of each witness and direct and cross-examination, any objections and rulings, and excusal of each witness;   Any documentary or physical evidence introduced, objections, rulings, and place where admitted or rejected;   Resting of case by either side, rebuttal, and surrebuttal;   Rights in extenuation, mitigation, and right to make a statement;   Arguments on findings/sentence;   Instructions on findings/sentence;    52  AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009 Announcement of findings/sentence;   Personal data on accused introduced;  Sentence limitations contained in pretrial agreement;   Post-trial and appellate rights advisement; and   Adjournment.   16.9.1.4.  If using cassette tapes, keep track of how much time is left on the tape.  Change tapes during recesses if the tape is almost used up.  If necessary, interrupt the proceedings to change the tape. 16.10.  Time Goals.  The time required to transcribe a record varies depending on a number of factors, such as the complexity of the case, the effectiveness of the court reporter’s equipment, the quality of the court reporter’s notes taken during trial, the court reporter’s familiarity with the equipment and software, etc.  As a general guideline, one hour of in-court proceedings should take no more than three hours to transcribe and, in more complex cases, no more than five hours to transcribe.  In calculating in-court time include short recesses, deliberations, and other short delays.  This goal is not an exact calculation but should be used as a guideline of what SJAs can expect.  Historically, it has taken an average of 18 days to complete the ROT from the date that the sentence or an acquittal is announced. 16.11.  Safeguarding  Recordings  and  Evidence.  The  court  reporter  must  safeguard  their laptop, tapes (if used), and evidence during recesses and while preparing the record of trial.  If a recording or evidence is lost, a verbatim transcript may not be able to be prepared.  This may result  in  the  convening  authority  not  being  able  to  approve  all  of  an  adjudged  sentence.    See RCM  1103(f).    During  recesses  and  overnight  adjournments,  court  reporters  should  keep  all transcription and evidence provided to them in a locked drawer or cabinet when not under their direct  observation.    If  a  problem  arises,  notify  the  military  judge,  trial  counsel,  or  SJA immediately.    Follow  these  security  measures  while  preparing  the  ROT  and  continue  until receiving an authenticated ROT. 16.12.  Retention  of  Trial  Notes  or  Recordings:  Retain  all  reporter's  notes,  worksheets, relevant  materials,  copies  of  audio  and  videotapes,  and  digital  and/or  tape  recordings  of  the original proceedings.  Annotate the documents with the accused’s name, date of trial and other pertinent data.  Dispose  of these items in accordance with the Air  Force Records  Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). 16.13.  Transcribing Other Proceedings Under the MCM.  Court reporters may be detailed to transcribe  depositions,  Article  32  reports  of  investigation,  DuBay  hearings,  contingency confinement  hearings,  and  courts  of  inquiry.    The  following  guidance  is  provided  for  these proceedings. 16.13.1.  Depositions.  Record and transcribe the deposition verbatim.  Note the opening and closing times and dates, and the times and dates of any recesses or adjournments.  The format for transcribing depositions is found in AFI 51-201, Figure 4.4.  The witness need not sign the  deposition.    The  deposition  officer  authenticates  the  deposition  and  the  court  reporter certifies  it.    See  RCM  702(f).    Refer  to  AFI  51-201,  Figure  4.5,  for  the  format  for  the AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009   53  authentication  and  court  reporter’s  certificate.    Depositions  may  be  recorded  digitally,  on audiotape or videotape.  See RCM 702(g)(3).  Depositions taken on written interrogatories are recorded and authenticated in the manner provided by DD Form 456, Interrogatories and Depositions.  Mark deposition exhibits in the lower right corner of the exhibit as “Deposition Exhibit 1, 2, etc.” 16.13.2.  Article  32  Reports  of  Investigation.    Court  reporters  may  be  detailed  to  take testimony in Article 32 pretrial investigations.  Normally such testimony is summarized.  AFI 51-201, paragraph 4.1.8 sets out the requirements for when verbatim testimony may be taken.  The  IO  is  responsible  for  the  content  of  the  summarized  testimony  of  each  witness.  Whenever possible the witness should sign the summarized testimony.  Refer to Figure 16.3 for a suggested format for summarized Article 32 testimony. 16.13.3.  DuBay Hearings.  DuBay  hearings are post-trial sessions ordered by an appellate court  to  find  facts  to  assist  the  reviewer  of  the  case.    These  proceedings  are  recorded verbatim unless otherwise directed.  Use the same format as used for courts-martial.  Number hearing exhibits numerically beginning with Hearing Exhibit 1.  Authenticate the transcript in the same manner as the ROT.  If documents are removed from the ROT and used in the hearing,  place  a  blank  sheet  of  paper  in  the  ROT  where  the  document  was  located  and annotate  where  the  document  is  now  located.    See  AFI  51-201,  paragraph  11.16,  for additional requirements. 16.13.4.  Contingency  Confinement  Hearings.    AFI  51-201,  paragraph  9.31,  sets  forth  the procedures  for  hearings  to  impose  confinement  adjudged  for  failing  to  pay  a  fine.    The proceedings may be summarized unless the convening authority directs a verbatim transcript.  Transcribe the military judge’s statement of evidence and findings verbatim if done on the record.  If the military judge does a written statement of evidence and findings, attach this to the  record  as  a  hearing  exhibit.    The  format  for  the  transcript  is  the  same  as  for  courts-martial.  Label exhibits numerically beginning with Hearing Exhibit 1.  Prepare a cover page similar  to  the  front  cover  of  the  DD  Form  490  and  an  index  of  testimony  and  exhibits.  Prepare an authentication sheet for the military judge similar to the authentication sheet used in ROTs, substituting “Contingency Confinement Hearing” for “Record of Trial.” 16.13.5.  Courts of Inquiry.  AFI 51-201, paragraph 4.2, and Article 135, UCMJ, set out the requirements for courts of inquiry.  The parties to a court of inquiry are the members (senior member is president), counsel for the court is the legal advisor, the “known party” is referred to  as  the  respondent,  his  or  her  counsel  is  referred  to  as  respondent’s  counsel,  and  the government  representative  is  referred  to  as  the  recorder.    The  court  reporter  prepares  a verbatim  transcript  of  the  proceedings,  and  the  president  of  the  court  of  inquiry  and  the counsel for the court authenticate it.  Prepare a cover sheet that is similar to the DD Form 490 and include an index and list of exhibits.  Label exhibits offered by the recorder numerically beginning  with  Government  Exhibit  1.    Label  exhibits  offered  by  the  respondent alphabetically  beginning  with  Respondent’s  Exhibit  A.    Label  court  exhibits  with  Roman numerals beginning with Court Exhibit I.   54  AFMAN51-203  17 NOVEMBER 2009 Figure 16.1.
