RELEASABILITY:  There are no releasability restrictions on this publication. OPR:   AFMSA/SG3PB   Certified by: HQ USAF/SG3 (Brig Gen Charles E. Potter) Pages: 79   This  manual  implements  requirements  of AFPD  48-1, Aerospace Medicine Enterprise and  AFI 48-145,  Occupational  and  Environmental  Health  Program.    It  provides  guidance  on  overall Occupational  and  Environmental  Health  (OEH)  program  management  and  incorporates  Risk Management (RM) principles into the OEH program. This  AFMAN  applies  to  all  Air  Force  (AF)  personnel  (active  duty,  civilian  federal  employees (CFE)  and  reserve  components).    This  AFMAN  does  not  apply  to  employees  working  under government  contract  or private contractors performing work under government contracts.   This AFMAN does not apply to state employees of Air National Guard organizations.  Contractors are solely responsible for compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards and the protection of their employees unless otherwise specified in their contract.  This does not prohibit AF personnel from providing sampling and survey information to contractors and  State  employees  based  on  local  arrangements  or  ensuring  government  furnished  facilities and equipment are meeting OSHA standards.  Refer recommended changes and questions to the Office  of  Primary  Responsibility  (Air  Force  Medical  Support  Agency/OEH  Division,  7700 Arlington Blvd, Falls Church, VA 22042) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of  Publication;  route  AF  IMT  847s  through  the  appropriate  functional  chain  of  command.

Newly published AFMAN 48-146 5.17 "Education and Training of AF HCPs, nurses and technicians" specifically  requires  physicians,  nurses  and  technicians  receive  NIOSH  certification  for interpretation and performance of spirometry.  AF Nurses are considered competent to perform spirometry by virtue of their training and certain physician specialties such as pulmonologist are well  versed  in  performance  and  interpretation  of  spirometry.    The  language  to  this  paragraph needs  modification  to  eliminate  NIOSH  spirometry  certification  for  those  who  are  already proficient  by  virtue  of  previous  training.    Recommended  changes  to  paragraph  5.17  are  as follows.  Chapter 1—OEH PROGRAM MANAGEMENT    1.1.

OEH Assessment. 1.1.1.  Air  Force  Instruction  48-145,  Occupational  and  Environmental  Health  Program, defines routine OEH assessment as ―…a qualitative and/or quantitative assessment conducted to  identify  and  scope  the  processes  employed/activities  encountered  when  executing  the unit‘s mission.‖  Special OEH assessment is defined as, ―typically a quantitative assessment that  focuses  resources  on  OEH-related  hazards  that  require  additional  evaluation  or classification.‖ 1.1.2.  The  primary  purpose  of  an  OEH  assessment  is  to  enhance  overall  mission effectiveness  by  protecting  AF  workers  from  OEH  hazards  that  may  be  present  in  home station and deployed environments, whether deliberate or crisis response mode. 1.1.2.1.  OEH  assessments  contribute  to  how  the  AF  Medical  Service  incorporates  AFI 10-601,  Operational  Capability  Requirements  Development  and  AFI  10-604, Capabilities-based  Planning  into  overall  AF  required  capabilities.    Additionally,  OEH assessments  provide  Bioenvironmental  Engineering  (BE)  with  an  opportunity  to  update administrative  data,  review  previous  OEH  assessment  information,  and  document changes to the health risk assessment (HRA). 1.1.2.1.1.  OEH  assessments  rely  on  firsthand  observation,  previously  collected information/data,  and  professional  judgment  (fully  qualified  Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE), civilian industrial hygienist, or BE Craftsman (4B071)). 1.1.2.1.2.  During  routine  OEH  assessments  (deliberate  response),  BE  may  verify previous  conclusions  using  point-in-time  exposure  measurements  collected  using direct reading instruments and use the information to prioritize and schedule special assessment(s). 1.1.2.1.3.  During crisis response assessments BE will follow local written procedures for response to all types of emergencies (fire, chemical spill, accident, terrorist threat, natural  disaster,  etc.).    BE  will  provide  technical  expertise  to  sample,  identify, quantify  and  monitor  hazards  such  as  toxic  industrial  chemicals/toxic  industrial materials  (TIC/TIM)  and  chemical,  biological,  radiological  and  nuclear  (CBRN) material  and  approve  personal  protective  equipment  (PPE)  used  by  AF  emergency responders  before  procurement  and  use.    During  emergency  (disaster)  response assessments  refer  to  AFI  10-2501,  Air  Force  Emergency  Management  Program Planning and Operations for additional guidance. 1.1.2.2.  OEH assessment is accomplished under the direction of a BEE (43E3X/43E4X), civilian  industrial  hygienist,  or  BE  Craftsman  (4B071).    BE  is  encouraged  to  invite  the Installation  Occupational  &  Environmental  Medicine  Consultant  (IOEMC),  Public Health  (PH)  and  other  OEH-related  specialists  to  participate  in  the  routine  OEH assessment process. 1.1.3.  OEH assessment is performed IAW requirements specified in AFI 48-145.   6  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 1.1.3.1.  BE  will  perform  OEH  assessments  for  new  process(es)  and/or  process(es)  not previously assessed within 3-months of the process(es) being identified or for before the process has been performed more than three times, whichever is longer.  The workplace categories and assessment frequencies established under AFI 48-145 generate minimum requirements for assessment; this does not preclude more frequent assessment activity. 1.1.3.1.1.  In  a  deployed  setting,  a  routine  OEH  assessment  of  a  Category-1 workplace should be performed during each Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) rotation, Category-2 workplaces should be performed annually or as operational tempo allows. 1.1.3.1.2.  During  weapon  system  acquisition  the  primary  purpose  is  to  identify, assess  and/or  eliminate  or  control  health  hazards  associated  with  day-to-day operations across the full life-cycle acquisition, sustainment and support for weapons systems,  munitions,  and  other  materiel  systems.    Aerospace  Medical  program personnel  should  work  closely  with  711th  Human  Performance  Wing  and  Air  Force Human  Systems  Integration  Office  subject  matter  experts  to  ensure  OEH  and  other related assessments are available to support these critical processes.  Refer to AFPD 48-1 and AFI 48-101. 1.2.  AF-approved  Occupational  &  Environmental  Health  (OEH-MIS)  Required  Use.  The Defense Occupational & Environmental Health Readiness System (DOEHRS), which is the DoD software application designed for use by  all Services, is  the AF-approved OEH-MIS for active duty, Air National Guard (ANG) and AF Reserve Command (AFRC).  DOEHRS will be used to archive all OEH exposure data for both garrison and deployed settings (classified areas exempt).  Use  of  other  management  information  systems  for  OEH  assessments  in  lieu  of  AF-approved OEH-MIS  is  strictly  prohibited.    Other  AF-approved  management  systems  are  used  for documenting  and  tracking  OEH  medical  exams,  injuries  and  illnesses,  and  other  OEH  patient interactions while ensuring protection of personnel health information within the limits of federal laws  and  regulations.    Medical  surveillance  requirements  and  official  correspondence  with workplace  supervisors,  while  created  and  primarily  stored  in  other  systems,  could  also  be uploaded to DOEHRS to maintain continuity. 1.3.  Review  Process.  A  qualified  reviewer  will  verify  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  all exposure  assessment  data  entered  in  the  OEH-MIS  (when  practicable  at  deployed  locations) according to  Flight/Element  QC procedures.  Arrange a qualified reviewer from  another unit if one  is  not  available.    A  qualified  reviewer  is  a  fully  qualified  BEE  (43E3X/43E4X),  civilian industrial hygienist (GS-9 or higher), or BE Craftsman (4B071). 1.4.  OEH-MIS  Training.  Department  of  Occupational and  Environmental  Health (USAFSAM/OE)  provides  in-house  training  to  ensure  personnel  can  effectively  use  the  OEH-MIS.  Training may include basic data entry and overview training, advanced user training and system administrator training. 1.5.  OEH Reports and Surveys.  OEH reports and surveys shall be retained IAW AFMAN 33-363,  Management  of  Records.    Records  and  the  Occupational  Environmental  Health  Exposure Data (OEHED) for similar exposure groups (SEG) in Category 1 and Category 2 workplaces that identify employees by name must be filed in the employee‘s medical  record  IAW AFI 41-210, Patient Administration Functions and AFI 48-145.  Employee exposure records are maintained in the OEH-MIS  IAW AFI 48-145, and must be preserved, maintained, and readily accessible for data  retrieval  and  analysis  for  a  minimum  of  40-years,  or  30-years  beyond  employment, AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   7  whichever  is  greater.    DoDI  6055.05,  Occupational  and  Environmental  Health,  and  29  CFR 1910.1020, Access to Employee Exposure and Medical Records, prescribe procedures for access to  employee  exposure  and  medical  records.    Employee  exposure  records  include  the  following minimum information according to 29 CFR 1910.1020(c)(5): 1.5.1.  Monitoring  results,  including  personal,  area,  grab,  wipe,  and/or  other  samples  and related information. 1.5.2.  Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) information pertaining to OEH hazards. 1.5.3.  Biological monitoring results.   8  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 Chapter 2 ROUTINE OEH ASSESSMENT 2.1.  General  Information.  The  main  objective  of  a  routine  OEH  assessment  is  to  identify, assess  and  evaluate  process  hazards  in  the  industrial  workplace    and  exposure  pathways  in  the non-industrial workplace and areas outside the workplace (ambient environment), and determine if  control  recommendations  are  needed  and/or  adequately  implemented.    Procedures  and guidance  for  conducting  routine  OEH  assessment  activities  are  outlined  in  the  following paragraphs. 2.1.1.  OEH  Assessments  are  divided  into  two  categories:    occupational  health  risk assessment (OHRA) and environmental health risk assessment (EHRA). 2.1.1.1.  OHRAs are conducted in workplaces.  OHRAs result in representative exposures to a similar exposure group (SEG). 2.1.1.2.  EHRAs  are  conducted  in  and  outside  of  the  workplace  and  includes  ambient environmental  conditions.    EHRAs  result  in  potential  exposures  to  populations  at  risk (PARs). 2.1.1.3.  The OHRAs and EHRAs are documented in the OEH-MIS, and together support the  Longitudinal  Exposure  Record  (LER).    Examples  of  how  to  document  OHRAs  and EHRAs in the OEH-MIS are presented in Table 2.1. 2.1.2.  Multiple  workplace  OEH  assessment  techniques  exist:  routine  assessments,  special assessments,  and  Environmental,  Safety  and  Occupational  Health  Compliance  Assessments (ESOH).  Accomplishing one type of assessment may satisfy one or both of the others. 2.1.2.1.  If  accomplishing  a  routine  or  special  workplace  assessment,  credit  for  portions of  an  ESOH  Compliance  Assessment  and  Management  Program  (ESOHCAMP) assessment  may  be  taken  if  the  assessment  meets  the  intent  of  AFI  90-803, Environmental,  Safety  and  Occupational  Health  Compliance  Assessment  and Management Program. 2.1.2.2.  An  ESOHCAMP  or  special  assessment(s)  can  be  considered  a  workplace‘s routine assessment, if the results/report meet the intent of paragraph 2.1. Additionally, the results  of  these  assessment(s)  must  be  presented  to  the  Occupational  &  Environmental Health Working Group (OEHWG) so that medical exam impacts can be determined. 2.1.2.3.  If accomplishing a special assessment in a workplace, credit for portions of the routine  assessment  and/or  the  ESOHCAMP  assessment  may  be  taken  as  long  as  the results  of  the  assessment  meet  the  intent  of  paragraph  2.1  for  routine  assessments (including OEHWG review) and AFI 90-803 for ESOHCAMP assessments. 2.2.  Identify  and  Establish  Industrial  Workplace.  The  industrial  workplace  is  typically  a physical  location,  e.g.,  a  specific  building,  the  flight  line  or  the  inside  of  an  airplane,  where personnel engage in activities associated with actual or potential exposure to OEH hazards.  The term  ―workplace‖  can  encompass  the  entire  occupational  and  non-occupational  environment exposure spectrum; it includes environmental health (EH) hazards in order to effectively use the OEH-MIS  to  build  a  comprehensive  LER  for  each  military  member.    At  a  minimum,  specific AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   9  OEH hazards must be linked to a workplace or a location.  In the OEH-MIS, the term industrial workplace is synonymous to the term "shop". 2.2.1.  Occupational  Health  Risk  Assessments  (OHRA):    The  industrial  workplace  is generally  a  location  where  the  OHRA  is  performed.    Examples  of  workplaces  where occupational health exposures may occur are provided in the examples below: 2.2.1.1.  Aircraft  Structural  Maintenance:  Aircraft  Structural  Maintenance  (ASM)  may consist  of  corrosion  control,  fiberglass,  sheet  metal,  composite  material  and  welding processes.    If  the  corrosion  control  process  has  a  dedicated  supervisor,  office  symbol, funding  account,  etc.,  and  dedicated  personnel  are  assigned,  it  may  be  appropriate  to establish  corrosion  control  as  a  separate  workplace.    However,  if  personnel  assigned  to ASM collectively perform  corrosion control, fiberglass, sheet  metal,  composite material and welding processes, ASM should be designated as the workplace. 2.2.1.2.  HAZMAT Response Team:  A single organization on an installation is typically responsible  for  overall  HAZMAT  response;  however,  personnel  from  different organizations,  e.g.,  Fire  and  Emergency  Services,  Liquid  Fuels,  Aircraft  Maintenance, etc.,  may  be  assembled  for  the  HAZMAT  Response  Team.    HAZMAT  response comprises  a  workplace  since  the  team  maintains  common  equipment,  stages  from  a common  facility,  and  has  a  dedicated  supervisor  with  associated  organizational authority/accountability. 2.2.2.  Environmental Health Risk Assessments (EHRA):  Personnel may encounter the full spectrum of OEH hazards while assigned to a particular duty location; the OEH hazards may be due to ambient environmental conditions or local industrial activities.  OEH hazards may present  potential  exposure  risks  to  a  population,  and  must  be  linked  to  a  location  or subordinate location (sub-location)  in the OEH-MIS. 2.2.2.1.  Examples of how to link actual or potential OEH exposures as part of the LER in OEH-MIS  are  shown  below  in  Table  2.1.  How  to  Link  Actual  or  Potential  OEH Exposures in OEH-MIS. 2.2.2.2.  Refer  to  AFMAN  48-154  and  the  Occupational  and  Environmental  Health  Site Assessment (OEHSA) TG for additional guidance on identifying and assessing exposure pathways and PARs and linking OEH hazards to locations.

Basic OEH Hazard Characterization. 2.3.1.  Pre-planning Activity. 2.3.1.1.  During  a  deliberate  response  a  qualified  reviewer  (paragraph  1.3)  should  audit previous OEH assessment activities to determine a surveillance strategy for the pending OEH assessment (e.g. ventilation, noise and air sampling strategies). 2.3.1.2.  During  crisis  response,  the  qualified  response-lead  should  focus  activities  to determine the surveillance strategy. 2.3.1.3.  This  audit  provides  foundational  knowledge  regarding  workplace  processes, health  hazards,  health  risks,  and  existing  controls.    Furthermore,  health-based  outcome data, e.g., OEH-related illness/injury investigations and/or trends, may provide insight on the  adequacy  of  current  OEH  hazard  characterization  and  effectiveness  of  associated AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   11  controls.    Note:    Hazards  may  be  present  even  in  the  absence  of  trends.    The  OEHWG can provide BE with OEH illness trends related to a specific workplace. related to  unit  mission,  operational 2.3.1.4.  Information tempo,  and  OEH impacts/concerns for assigned personnel is used to determine the scope of required OEH support.    This  is  especially  critical  when  new  workplaces/processes  are  identified.  Minimum  information  that  should  be  collected  during  pre-planning  includes,  as applicable:  organization  name,  parent  command/headquarters,  mission  description, description  of  operations  performed,  location,  and  potential  exposure  locations,  e.g. subordinate units, area on installation, name of workplace supervisor (or equivalent) and contact information. 2.3.2.  Identify Process(es). 2.3.2.1.  Contact the workplace supervisor (or equivalent), as appropriate, to explain the purpose of the OEH risk assessment and identify process(es).  Minimum  information to be conveyed includes: 2.3.2.1.1.  The scope of and schedule for completing routine OEH assessment. 2.3.2.1.2.  Status of previously identified findings. 2.3.2.1.3.  Adverse trends in clinical surveillance or OEH-related illnesses. 2.3.3.  Associate OEH Hazards with Process(es) or Locations. 2.3.3.1.  A  process  is  the  lowest  level  of  work  that  may  pose  a  risk,  and  may  require evaluation and control to ensure human health is adequately protected.  The terms activity and  process  are  synonymous.  Not  all  processes  are  associated  with  a  physical  location, e.g.,  working  near  the  flight  line  may  constitute  a  process.    Examples  of  some  OEH processes are provided below: 2.3.3.1.1.  Aircraft painting is divided into distinct processes, e.g., primer application, top-coat application, and stenciling operations. 2.3.3.1.2.  Multiple  plating  tanks  in  a  workplace  create  potential  exposures  for personnel  who  move  between  tanks  to  accomplish  work.    This  may  be  defined  as  a single  process,  unless  there  are  significant  exposure  differences  or  PPE/control requirements among the tanks. 2.3.3.2.  Initial  and  updated  OEHSAs  conducted  IAW  AFMAN  48-154,  Occupational and  Environmental  Health  Site  Assessment,  are  critical  for  identifying  exposure pathways, generating initial/special assessments, and documenting to a location. 2.3.3.2.1.  Potential  radon  exposure  (occupational  or  non-occupational  setting)  IAW 48-148, Ionizing Radiation Protection. 2.3.3.2.2.  Fugitive  emissions,  or  other  OEH  hazard,  affecting  housing  or  an administrative building from an adjacent industrial operation. 2.3.3.2.3.  Force  bed-down  on  a  site  where  hazardous  materials  may  have  been buried. 2.3.3.3.  Assign an appropriate name to each process or exposure pathway, and provide a clear  description.    The  workplace  supervisor  (or  equivalent)  or  the  OEH  hazard  source   12  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 owner can aid in effectively naming and describing each process or pathway.  Guidance for naming a process is provided below. Guidance for naming an exposure pathway can be found in the OEHSA TG. 2.3.3.3.1.  A single ―painting‖ process established under ASM is inappropriate due to the  unique  health  hazards  and  PPE  requirements  associated  with  clearly  distinct processes,  e.g.,  de-painting,  priming,  painting,  applying  top-coat,  etc.    A  better convention would be to name each specific process. 2.3.3.3.2.  ―Riveting‖  is  too  general  as  a  description  to  identify  the  scope  of  this process;  ―removing  and  replacing  B-52  rivets‖  is  a  better  and  more  descriptive choice. 2.3.3.3.3.  Weapon system processes and description must be based upon and utilize Technical Order (TO) verbiage. 2.3.4.  Establishing Similar Exposure Groups (SEG). 2.3.4.1.  SEGs establish a link between a group of individuals and an OEH exposure(s).  Representative  and/or  individual  exposure  assessment  data  are  applied  to  personnel assigned to a SEG(s).  A SEG can be established by:  (1) observing work practices, (2) accomplishing  OEH  hazard  characterization/assessment  and  using  data  to  define  the SEG, or (3) a combination of both activities. 2.3.4.2.  A  single  SEG  is  adequate  if  all  individuals  assigned  to  a  workplace  encounter the  same  OEH  hazards  and  have  the  same  exposure  potential.  Multiple  SEGs  are necessary  to  accurately  reflect  ―representative‖  exposures  for  workers  assigned  to  the same  workplace,  but  who  are  exposed  to  different  hazards  and/or  exposure  potential.  Establishing  SEGs  is  a  critical  step  since  the  SEG  reports  provide  details  to  define  the overall workplace prioritization category. 2.3.4.3.  Personnel  may  be assigned to  multiple SEGs and/or assigned to a SEG outside their  assigned  unit,  e.g.  an  individual  may  be  assigned  to  a  HAZMAT  response  team, which is composed of individuals from various workplaces. 2.3.4.4.  SEG data must be collected and documented for both home station and deployed locations to ensure an accurate LER is maintained for all AF personnel.  Upon arrival in theater,  the  individual  must  be  assigned  to  the  appropriate  deployed  SEG(s).    Home station and deployment exposures will be documented in the OEH-MIS. 2.3.5.  Establishing Populations At Risk (PARs) 2.3.5.1.  PARs establish a link between a non-industrial group of individuals and an OEH exposure(s) via a common location or sub-location.  EHRAs and exposure data are linked to locations.  Service members are not directly assigned and managed in PARs like SEGs. 2.3.5.2.  A  PAR  is  defined  by  OEH  hazard  exposure  pathway  identified  and  managed through the OEHSA process.  Reference the OEHSA TG for additional details. 2.3.6.  Identifying OEH Hazard Controls.  BE assesses the adequacy of existing controls and provides  OEH  hazard  control  recommendations  to  workplace  supervisors  (or  equivalent)  if required.    Control  category  recommendations  will  be  provided  according  to  the  following priority:    (1)  engineering  controls,  (2)  administrative  controls,  (3)  PPE.    (See  Figure  2.1, AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   13  Hierarchy of Controls).  A combination of controls may be necessary to reduce exposure to an acceptable level, especially while engineering controls are being designed/installed, or are not feasible. 2.3.6.1.  If  BE  determines  technical  order  control  requirements  are  not  adequate  or appropriate,  BE  can  submit  a  change  request  based  on  exposure  data  and  recommend appropriate control requirements IAW TO 00-5-1, AF Technical Order System. 2.3.6.2.  BE associates OEH hazard control information to a specific process or location and documents this information in the OEH-MIS. 2.3.6.2.1.  Engineering Controls.   Engineering controls  eliminate or reduce exposure to  risk  factors  and  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  physical  changes  to workstations  (install  local  exhaust  ventilation),  new  tools  or  equipment,  materials, processes (wet methods, automation, isolation and enclosure),  process elimination or substitution with less hazardous materials.  Environmental health hazard controls may include ventilation systems for radon exposure, enclosure for lead-based paint, or an air  scrubber  for  various  pollutants.    BE  must  advocate  engineering  controls  to  the greatest  extent  feasible/practical;  clearly  communicate  courses  of  action  to  the commanders  regarding  engineering  control  solutions  and  assign  risk  assessment codes where applicable. 2.3.6.2.2.  Administrative Controls.  Administrative controls, which manage potential exposure  to  an  acceptable  level,  include  but  are  not  limited  to:  job  rotation,  job transfer,  limiting  exposure  time,  housekeeping,  personal  hygiene  and  education  and training.    Regulatory  requirements  prohibit  job  rotation  as  a  means  for  controlling exposure  to  certain  contaminants,  e.g.,  asbestos.    Administrative  controls  should  be prioritized to maximize effectiveness. 2.3.6.2.3.  Personal  Protective  Equipment.    PPE  is  used  when  other  control  options are  not  feasible  or  adequate,  e.g.,  during  emergency  response  operations.    With  the exception of uniquely military situations, PPE requirements will be assessed IAW 29 CFR  1910,  Subpart  I,  Personal  Protective  Equipment,  to  ensure  appropriate equipment is selected and used.   14  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 Figure 2.1.  Hierarchy of Controls. 2.4.  OH Exposure Assessment Priority (EAP).  If an exposure is unacceptable or uncertain, an EAP  must  be  assigned.    EAP  indicates  the  assessor‘s  priority  for  collecting  information.    EH does not use the EAP process to assess risk; EH uses the RM process.  RM information allows commanders to make informed risk decisions.  The RM process does not override or supersede compliance  with  federally  mandated  OSHA  standards  (DoDI  6055.1,  DoD  Safety  and Occupational Health Program, Enclosure 3).  If BE has collected sufficient information, then the EAP  would  indicate  a  low  priority  even  in  situations  where  the  RM  would  indicate  high  risk.  Figure 2.2 illustrates the EAP hazard assessment priority process.  The OEH-MIS calculates the EAP using a 3-step process:  2.4.1.  Step 1:  Select a Health Effect Rating (HER) (aka Severity).  See Section 2.4.5. 2.4.2.  Step 2:  Select the Exposure Rating (ER) (aka Probability).  See Section 2.4.6. 2.4.3.  Step  3:    Determine  the  Uncertainty  Rating  (UR).    See  Section  2.4.7.    The  UR  is determined by selecting the confidence in hazard and exposure characterization (Attachment 2) and confidence in existing controls (Attachment 3). 2.4.4.  Based on the user selections from the above 3-steps, the OEH-MIS calculates the EAP by  multiplying  the  (HER  *  ER)  *  UR.    EAP  values  range  from  1  to  125:  1  is  the  lowest priority  and  125  is  the  highest  priority  (Table  2.5).          NOTE:  The  OEH  hazard  risk determination  process  follows  guidance  set  forth  in  AFPAM  90-902,  Operational  Risk Management  (ORM)  Guidelines  and  Tools.    The  terms,  definitions  and  process  may  differ slightly but the process is consistent with established guidance. AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   15  Figure 2.2.  OEH Exposure Assessment Priority (aka Hazard Assessment Process).  2.4.5.  Health  Effect  Rating  (HER).    The  HER  is  similar  to  the  Severity  rating.    .    For  any particular  hazard,  the  HER  is  a  measure/estimate  of  the  health  effect  related  to  an individual‘s  exposure  without  regard  to  use  of  administrative  controls  or  PPE  (Figure  2.1).  The HER is a function of dose (magnitude, frequency and duration of exposure) and response (expected health outcome associated with  a particular exposure).   The HER  is  the potential for  an  exposure  to  result  in  an  OEH-related  illness/injury.    Some  chemical  hazards  in  the OEH-MIS are pre-loaded with an HER based on an exposure level equal to the Occupational and Environmental Exposure Limit (OEEL). Table 2.2.  Health Effects Rating.

Could occur at some time; exposure infrequent; less than 10% of OEEL. Unlikely; can assume will not occur; no detectable exposure 2.4.7.  Uncertainty  Rating  (UR).    The  UR  (Table  2.4)  is  computed  as  a  function  of  the confidence in hazard and exposure characterization and the confidence in existing controls as an intermediate value in the calculation of the EAP.  For each OEH hazard requiring an EAP determination, assess the confidence in hazard and exposure characterization (Attachment 2) and confidence in existing controls (Attachment 3). Table 2.4.

Record the rationale for assigning the HER, ER  and UR in the OEH-MIS to establish a  historical  record  of  decisions.    This  is  especially  important  when  the  decisions  are  based primarily on qualitative  information  or professional  judgment  (fully qualified BEE, civilian industrial hygienist, or BE Craftsman (4B071)). 2.4.9.  The  EAP  can  result  in  a  number  of  priority  ratings  (Table  2.5)  which  impact management  decisions.    Decisions  include  but  are  not  limited  to  1)  No  action  required,  2) Collect  additional  exposure  data  (internal/external  projects),  or  3)  Recommend  modifying controls or processes.  EAP component choices (HER, ER, and UR) also affect management decisions. Table 2.5.  Exposure Assessment Priority.

Workplace  Monitoring  Plan  (Internal)  Projects.    Internal  projects  require action/completion  by  BE  within  a  specified  time  frame,  e.g.,  sampling.    Sampling strategies to complete internal projects should optimize use of resources, e.g., manpower, equipment,  in  a  cost  effective  manner.    The  project  description  should  include  these minimum elements: 2.4.9.1.1.  Specific OEH hazard requiring measurement, e.g., chromates in primer 2.4.9.1.2.

Special  OEH  Assessment.  Special  OEH  assessments  are  typically  a  quantitative assessment of OEH hazards that require additional evaluation based on findings generated during a  routine  assessment  or  trigger  event.    It  may  include  work  that  is  not  part  of  or  cannot  be completed as part of routine OEH assessment.  Examples include, but are not limited to:  detailed sampling and analysis of industrial processes or OEHSA exposure pathways, follow-up activity from  OEH  illness  or  injury  reports,  pregnancy  evaluations,  assessments  of  abnormal epidemiological lead-based  paint  HRA,  and/or  review  of  engineering/facility modifications. trends, 3.2.  Special Assessment.  Some special assessments may be required on a recurring basis, e.g., periodic  ventilation  system  evaluations  or  inspections  in  a  regulated  area.    All  special assessments must be associated with at least one process or exposure pathway documented in the OEH-MIS.  Special  Assessment.    Special  assessments  will  be  actively  managed,  scheduled, completed  or  deferred  using  the  priority  established  in  Table  2.5.    In  the  event  special assessments  are  deferred  due  to  insufficient  resources,  BE  will  use  the  deferred  assessment  as justification for additional resources.   In situations where a special assessment has identified a health hazard that requires action by a ―non-BE‖ entity, a Risk Assessment Code (RAC) should be assigned.  RACs are used to assist with prioritizing abatement plans and mitigating hazards, and are the DoD directed tool to communicate hazards to commanders and the AF leadership. 3.3.  Exposure Assessment. 3.3.1.  A special OEH exposure assessment is  accomplished to  increase confidence in  OEH hazard  characterization  and/or  confidence  in  hazard  control  performance.    Accurate,  valid exposure assessment data form the foundation of an effective OEH program.  The American Industrial  Hygiene  Association  publication  ―A  Strategy  for  Assessing  and  Managing Occupational  Exposures‖  provides  a  thorough  discussion  on  numerous  tools  and  methods that can be used to effectively collect OEH exposure data. 3.3.2.  Confidence in an OEH hazard characterization may be affected by previous exposure assessments,  e.g.,  quantitative  measurement  data  (obtained  locally  or  consolidated  from similar operations from other locations), or estimates of exposure (modeling). 3.3.2.1.  Quantitative  Measurement  Data.   Data  collected  under  actual  operating conditions for a specific location/process provide an ideal estimate for a given SEG/PAR exposure.  Consolidated data for similar operations can be an acceptable substitute with appropriate  application  of  professional  judgment  by  a  fully  qualified  BEE,  civilian industrial  hygienist,  or  BE  Craftsman  (4B071).    Detailed  information  on  exposure assessments can be obtained from USAFSAM. 3.3.2.1.1.  Screening  Assessment.    A  screening  assessment  provides  an  initial estimate of OEH exposure.  If one measurement result is far below 10% of an OEEL and variability in the exposure profile is minimal, then one measurement may be all that  is  needed  to  have  high  confidence  in  exposure  characterization.    If  a measurement is well above the OEEL but variability in the exposure profile is large, the confidence in exposure characterization would be low.  However, a minimum of AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   19  three samples is recommended to complete a screening assessment. Sampling can be accomplished  using  a  direct-reading  instrument  or  traditional  integrated  sampling techniques.    Screening  samples  should  be  random,  collected  over  time,  and  from different workers within the SEG.  If possible, screening samples should be taken on three different days to account for some inter-day process variability.  The conditions during  each  sampling  event  must  be  fully  documented  using  a  sample  narrative.    If the  95th  percentile  of  the  exposure  distribution  estimated  by  the  three  screening sample  results  is  less  than  the  action  level  of  the  OEEL,  application  of  professional judgment  by  a  fully  qualified  BEE,  civilian  industrial  hygienist,  or  BE  Craftsman (4B071) is required to determine the need for further sampling. 3.3.2.1.2.  Detailed  Assessment.    A  detailed  assessment  is  necessary  if  the  results from  the  screening  assessment  are  inconclusive  or  indicate  further  assessment  is required.  A detailed assessment is conducted to better characterize an exposure.  This is  done  by  using  all  available  sample  results  including  past  sample  results  and corresponding  narratives.    The  variance  in  operations,  sampling  methods  and limitations  of  analytical  methods  used  must  be  taken  into  consideration  when performing a detailed assessment. 3.3.2.2.  Modeling.  Modeling can be used to  make a conservative  estimate of exposure by  demonstrating  a  worst-case  scenario  that  will  result  in  an  exposure  well  below  an established  OEEL;  however,  personnel  must  understand  the  limitations  of  any  model before  using  it  to  estimate  exposures.    Modeling  is  typically  an  ‗order  of  magnitude‘ estimate  -  a  qualified  reviewer  should  identify  that  the  model  assumptions  tend  to overestimate  exposures.    Comparing  the  OEEL  with  this  exposure  overestimate  should allow a qualified reviewer to determine if an exposure is ‗acceptable‘ or that more data is needed. 3.3.3.  Special assessments may require detailed assessment of existing OEH hazard controls.  Confidence in OEH hazard controls is based on an assessment of existing control conditions. 3.3.4.  Multiple processes may significantly contribute to the overall exposure during a work shift.  Overall exposure may be assessed for a single process or a full work shift (more than one  process).    Make  every  attempt  to  sample  as  much  of  the  work  shift  as  possible  and include segments of greatest exposure during the sampling periods.  Cumulative exposure for an 8-hour work shift must be computed prior to comparing sampling results to an 8-hour time weight average (TWA) exposure standard. 3.3.5.  A conventional work schedule is five consecutive 8-hour workdays, followed by two days  off.    Most  OEH  exposure  standards  are  developed  based  on  application  of  a conventional  work  schedule.    However,  standards  based  on  an  8-hour  workday  may  be inappropriate when applied to unconventional work schedules or extended work shifts, e.g., under deployment conditions.  Detailed information on a technique that can be used to adjust for non-standard conditions is provided in Attachment 4.   20  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 Chapter 4 OEH RISK COMMUNICATION 4.1.  OEH Assessment.  The OEH assessment process is complete when the risks and results are communicated  and  the  report  is  sent  to  the  workplace  supervisor  (or  equivalent)  via  the workplace  commander.    OEH  risk  communication  is  pertinent  to  SEGs,  PARs,  OEH  hazards outside  the  workplace  as  well  as  industrial  and  non-industrial  workplaces.  Supervisors  (or equivalents) are expected to address follow-up/corrective actions by the suspense dates provided and  reply  in  writing  to  BE.    All  follow-up/corrective  actions  require  BE  follow-up  until  the discrepancy is corrected. 4.2.  Immediate  Risk  Communication.  Do  not  delay  in  reporting  this  information  under  the following conditions.   When  an 4.2.1.  Immediately  Dangerous  to  Life  or  Health  (IDLH)  Environment. environment is determined to be IDLH, BE must recommend immediate cessation of process then  report  condition  to  workplace  supervisor  as  well  as  medical  treatment  facility  (MTF) chain of command as soon as possible. 4.2.2.  Exposures  that  exceed  OEEL.    When  an  uncontrolled  exposure  is  suspected  to  be above  a  relevant  OEEL,  BE  will  immediately  report  that  condition  to  the  workplace supervisor, then report through the MDG chain of command as soon as possible. 4.3.  OEH Reporting: 4.3.1.  Assessment  Reporting.    The  OEH  assessment  report  identifies  significant  findings, conclusions  and  recommendations.    BE  will  determine  local  requirements  for  including additional  information  to  address  base-specific  needs.    BE  will  communicate  significant findings to the workplace supervisor (or equivalent) at the conclusion of the OEH assessment no  more  than  60-days  after  initial  contact  with  workplace  supervisor  or  IAW  OSHA standards when applicable. 4.3.1.1.  Routine  OEH  Risk  Communication.   Attachments  to  the  routine  OEH assessment  report  should  be  generated  directly  from  information/data  archived  in  the OEH-MIS.  Recommended content for routine OEH assessment reports includes: 4.3.1.1.1.  Cover letter. 4.3.1.1.2.  Summary of health risks and list of current processes which exceed action levels, or exposure pathways with unacceptable exposure. 4.3.1.1.3.  Summary of all RACs  assigned to the shop/processes 4.3.1.1.4.  Recommendations  and  required  follow-up  actions,  including  suspense dates and request to notify BE of completion in writing. 4.3.1.1.5.  Direct  the  workplace  supervisor  (or  equivalent)  to  make  the  report  and attachments available to all employees IAW AFI 91-202, paragraph 1.5.20.10. 4.3.1.2.  Attachments: 4.3.1.2.1.

Special OEH Risk Communication 4.3.2.1.  The results from the screening and/or detailed assessment will be documented in the  OEH-MIS.    A  special  assessment  report  will  be  prepared  and  distributed  to  the affected commanders, functional managers, or workplace supervisor (or equivalent).  For OSHA  expanded  standard  OEH  hazards,  ensure  reporting  timelines  are  IAW  OSHA standards.    Report  format  and  coordination  will  be  determined  by  local  decision/policy but shall include health risk summary and recommendations/courses of action. 4.3.2.2.  BE will establish local procedures to ensure affected individuals receive written notification  of  special  assessment  results,  e.g.,  air  sampling  or  noise  dosimetry  results.  Procedures  must  include  requirements  for  documenting  the  date  sample  results  are received,  for  a    Quality  Assurance/  Quality  Control  (QA/QC)  review  and  steps  for tracking special assessment report completion. 4.3.2.3.  Outcomes  from  special  assessments  that  result  in  a  significant  change  to  the health  risk  and  exposure  pathways  must  be  presented  to  the  OEHWG  (or  equivalent), including plans for additional evaluations and recommendations to reduce risk. 4.4.  Occupational  and  Environmental  Health  Exposure  Data  (OEHED).  The  OEHED  is exposure  assessment  data  used  to  determine  the  operational  risk  associated  with  actual  and/or potential OEH exposures and to develop preventive medicine recommendations associated with an individual or SEG. 4.4.1.  OEHED  is  updated  as  part  of  the  routine  OEH  and  special  assessment  surveys,  or whenever there is a significant change to exposure data, existing controls, or the adequacy of existing controls. 4.4.2.  BE will ensure complete OEHED is loaded into the OEH-MIS. 4.4.3.  A  current  OEHED  generated  from  the  OEH-MIS  will  be  provided  to  PH  for  the OEHWG (as applicable) to determine Medical Surveillance Exam (MSE) requirements. 4.4.4.  For Category-1 and Category-2 workplaces, a current  copy of the OEHED summary will be filed in the worker's medical record (or uploaded to the electronic medical record if resources allow) at the time of each MSE or departure from the deployed environment. 4.5.  OEH  Chronological  Record.  BE  will  maintain  a  chronological  record  of  each  contact with a workplace in the OEH-MIS.  The record must include the date, individual contacted, type of contact (telephone, email, workplace visit, letter sent/received), reason for the contact, and a brief summary of any relevant information discussed/transmitted.   22  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 Chapter 5 OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE SERVICES: SURVEILLANCE, FITNESS FOR DUTY, CARE AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT 5.1.  General Information.  Both Occupational and Environmental Medicine (OEM) are within the scope of Occupational Medicine, a branch of preventive medicine focused on the health and safety of workers in industrial environments and populations exposed to environmental hazards.  In  the  AF,  OEM  is  provided  under  the  oversight  and  direction  of  the  IOEMC  in  coordination with  PH  through  Flight  Medicine  (FM)  clinics  and,  at  select  bases,  by  Occupational  Medicine Services  (OMS)  clinics.    AF  OEM  programs,  policies  and  procedures  are  based  on  medical science and on agreements,  laws, and policies that  come from  local,  state and federal  laws and guidelines (e.g. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Department of Labor (DoL), Office of Workers  Compensation  Program  (OWCP),  Division  of  Longshore  and  Harbor  Workers Compensation  (DLHWC),  29  CFR  1910,  5  CFR  339,  American  College  of  Governmental Industrial  Hygienists,  American  National  Standards  Institute,  Department  of  Transportation; union agreements) and on OEM principals.  This chapter is primarily a guide to the AF Health Care Provider (HCP) and nurse who may be responsible for supporting OEM at the base level.  It also contains sections specifically applicable to PH. 5.2.  Eligibility for AF OEM Services (5 CFR 339, AFH 41-114, AFI 41-115, AFI 41-210): 5.2.1.  Active  Duty  (AD)  Members.    AD  members  are  fully  eligible  for  AF  OEM  services (typically  provided  in  FM  or  OMS  clinics).    They  receive  care  for  work  related illnesses/injuries  in  their  assigned  MTF  when  the  MTF  can  provide  required  services  or through the TRICARE network as needed. 5.2.2.  Air National  Guard (ANG) and USAF Reserve (USAFR) Members.  ANG members received  OEM  services  through  the  ANG  Medical  Group  at  their  assigned  wing.    USAFR member OEM support is arranged through the Reserve Medical Unit. 5.2.3.  DoD Civilian Federal Employees (CFE) Eligibility for OEM services. 5.2.3.1.  CFEs  receive  AF  required  medical  examinations  and  assessments  from  AF designated HCP at no cost to the CFE (5 CFR 339.303; 29 CFR 1910).  When an MTF lacks  the  resources  to  perform    a  required  examination,  specialty  consult,  study  or  lab, IOEMC may arrange to send the patient to the civilian community (within 25 miles of the base when possible) upon approval of funding from the unit or organization to whom the CFE belongs (see details  later in  this chapter).  The  IOEMC is  responsible for ensuring results are of adequate quality to protect the CFE and the interests of the USAF. 5.2.3.2.  DoD CFEs may elect to seek care for work-related illness and injury within the MTF when and where supported at the discretion of the MTF/CC (See 5 CFR 339, AFH 41-114, AFI 41-115, and AFI 41-210).  If a CFE elects care for a work related condition in an MTF that supports provision of care, the CFE must sign a statement designating the AF  health  care  provider  as  his  or  her  treating  physician  for  the  CFEs‘  Workers‘ Compensation claimed condition.  (See sample form, attachment 5)  However, if the CFE previously  elected  care  for  the  same  medical  condition  through  OWCP  from  a  non-AF HCP, the CFE must first obtain a written authorization from OWCP to change providers. AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   23  5.2.3.3.  DLHWC  only  applies  to  NAF  employees  for  whom  only  one  time  initial  care may be provided (when local policy permits) in an AF MTF prior to being referred by the NAF liaison to care in the civilian community. 5.2.3.4.  Some CFEs are covered by insurance other than OWCP and DLHWC (e.g. some DECA  members).    Specific  requirements  re:    illness  and  injury  treatment  may  apply.  Contact the local base Civilian Personnel Services to learn if any CFEs on base fall into this category. 5.2.3.5.  Where  resources  permit,  CFEs  can  be  assessed  by  an  AF  HCP  to  determine fitness  to  complete  a  work  shift  (when  requested  by  the  CFE‘s  supervisor)  and  may  be provided with first aid at no expense to the CFE (See Section 37 of AFH 41-114, AFI 41-210). 5.2.3.6.  When an AF HCP determines an illness or injury alleged to be work related by the  CFE  was  not  caused  by  factors  of  AF  employment,  the  AF  HCP  shall  provide  no further care or medical work up for the condition. 5.2.3.7.  When  emergency  stabilization  prior  to  transport  is  indicated  for  a  non-work related  condition,  this  shall  be  provided  and  the  clinic  will  notify  the  MTF  resource management office in order to recover expenses. 5.2.3.8.  Dual status employees (CFEs who are eligible for TRICARE benefits) may elect medical  care  for  a  work  related  condition  through  their  assigned  MTF  or  TRICARE provider. 5.2.4.  Eligibility  of  OEM  Services  for  Contract  workers.    Contract  workers  unless specifically authorized in writing or by official DoD or AF policy  are not eligible for care, Fitness For Duty Examinations (FFDEs) or Medical Surveillance Examinations (MSEs) in an MTF and shall obtain OEM services through their employer (AFI 41-210, AFI 41-115, AFH 41-114).    If  a  contract  employee  presents  to  an  MTF  and  requires  emergency  stabilization prior  to  transport,  this  shall  be  provided  and  the  clinic  will  notify  the  MTF  resource management office in order to recover costs.  (Other rules may apply in a deployed setting or if otherwise covered in an AF or DoD contract). 5.2.5.  Eligibility  of  OEM  Services  for  Supervisors,  AF  Attorneys,  Civilian  Personnel Services and AF providers:  OEM consultative services may be provided to each of these as required for official AF activities. 5.3.  Required  OEM  Examinations  and  Assessments  for  CFEs  that  Exceed  Local  MTF Capability.  Consults, studies, laboratory tests or medical examinations for non-Defense Health Program (DHP) covered medical assessment of CFEs may be ordered when required to support the needs of the AF and when the local Medical Treatment Facility  (MTF) has the resources to support the required activity (AFI 41-210).  When the MTF does not  have resources  available, these  examinations  etc.  may  also  be  obtained  outside  of  the  MTF  at  the  expense  of  the  CFE‘s unit or organization per the process described below. 5.3.1.  AF HCP Request for Outside Examination or Assessment. 5.3.1.1.  Only  when  doing  so  is  required  by  or  for  the  AF  and  the  local  MTF  cannot provide support will the AF HCP order consults, studies, laboratory tests or examinations for a CFE from the civilian medical community.  When the purpose of the consult, study,   24  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 laboratory test or examination is solely to secure a benefit sought by the CFE and not to meet  a need or request  of the AF, the CFE is  responsible for all costs and should make arrangements.  In the absence of written guidance, the AF HCP will first confirm with the CFE‘s supervisor and CPS that a consult, study, test or examination is required by or for the  AF.    Prior  to  contacting  the  supervisor  and  CPS,  the  AF  HCP  should    consider  the following  three  primary  reasons  for  an  AF  HCP  to  order  an  AF  funded  civilian  sector consult, study or test or examination: 5.3.1.1.1.  The outside consult, study, laboratory test or examination is required by the AF in order to comply with a law or official policy and the local MTF cannot support internally  (e.g.  the  OSHA  Hazardous  Noise  standard  requires  interpretation  of abnormal audiograms by a qualified HCP but the MTF has no qualified HCP). 5.3.1.1.2.  There is evidence to suggest the CFE has a disqualifying medical condition or one that would require work limitations (e.g. post cerebral vascular accident with possible cognitive deficits); the medical information obtainable from the CFE, his or her  personal  HCP(s)  or  OWCP  treating  physician  is  insufficient  to  support  a defensible  medical  recommendation  to  remove  or  return  to  extended  partial  or  full duty;  and  the  evaluating  AF  HCP  determines  a  consult,  study,  laboratory  test  or examination is needed to obtain additional information to support a requested medical recommendation to the base Civilian Personnel Services (CPS) or the supervisor. 5.3.1.1.3.  The CFE‘s private physician has provided information in support of a CFE obtaining  special  treatment  or  accommodation  from  a  supervisor  (e.g.  permanently cannot  work  more  than  6-hours  a  day),  but  the  AF  HCP  judges  the  medical assessment  or  recommendations  are  inaccurate  or  inappropriate.    However,  the  AF HCP  does  not  feel  he  or  she  can  defend  a  contrasting  medical  opinion  without obtaining a medical consult, study, laboratory test or examination. 5.3.1.2.  The AF HCP completes a request for the required examination services on a DD Form  2161  Referral  for  Civilian  Medical  Care.    When  completing  this  form,  the  HCP ensures the form and request: 5.3.1.2.1.  Meet Referral Management Center (RMC) criteria for a consult or referral. 5.3.1.2.2.  Clearly  state  the  request  is  for  assessment  only  and  does  not  include  a request or authorization for actual medical care or treatment. 5.3.1.2.3.  The cost estimate for the service requested is included (the ordering clinic will need to verify the cost estimate with an outside service provider). 5.3.1.2.4.  Boxes  at  top  of  the  form  and  under  the  patient  information  section  are checked to indicate charges are to be billed to the referring medical treatment facility. 5.3.1.2.5.  All portions of the form referring to CHAMPUS are crossed out. 5.3.1.2.6.  Under  ―Information  for  Civilian  Providers  of  Care‖  the  RMC‘s  office symbol  and  address  are  entered  along  with  a  note  explaining  that  ―Payment  will  be withheld until receipt of the completed written report.‖ 5.3.1.2.7.  Line  through  ―Health  Benefits  Advisor  Signature‖  and  replace  with ―Referral  Management  Center  Officer  Signature.‖  An  RMC  officer  signs  in  the appropriate space. AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   25  5.3.1.3.  Tracking  the  referral  process  may  be  facilitated  by  use  of  a  tracking  form  (see sample in Attachment 6). 5.3.1.4.  The acting  IOEMC approves or rejects  requests for a  Line unit  or organization funded  consult,  study,  laboratory  test  or  examination.      The  IOEMC  is  responsible  for ensuring  the  consult  appropriately  supports  a  legitimate  AF  requirement  for  clinical assessment  and  does  not  authorize  medical  care  or  treatment.    Unit  or  organization funding commitment must be obtained prior to sending the consult request. 5.3.2.  Obtaining Funding for Outside Examinations and Assessments.  Consults, studies and tests that will be done outside the MTF for a CFE must be approved for full payment before they  are  ordered.      If  the  AF  HCP  determines  a  required  examination  or  assessment  is appropriate and the local MTF does not have the capability to provide the examination (or a portion  of  the  exam),  the  MTF  may  arrange  to  have  the  examination  (lab  tests,  etc.) performed the  civilian  sector  (non-DoD)  healthcare  community  after  receiving authorization from  the CFE‘s unit or organization commander  guaranteeing payment  of the examination.    Payment  is  made  from  the  same  appropriation  that  funds  the  CFE‘s  salary.  The  Defense  Health  Program  (DHP)  appropriation  may  not  be  used  for  the  examination, unless the employee‘s salary is DHP-funded (e.g., an MTF CFE). in 5.3.2.1.  The  MTF  provider‘s  support  staff  notifies  the  MTF  Resource  Management Office (RMO) that a private sector exam is needed for a CFE (the clinic must include the estimated cost of the exam/test). 5.3.2.2.  The  RMO  sends  a  Request  for  Commander‘s  Authorization  of  Payment  for Civilian Medical Exam (Attachment 7) packet to the employee's Unit Commander.  The packet includes two attachments: 5.3.2.2.1.  Commander‘s  Authorization  of  Payment  for  Civilian  Medical  Exam (Attachment 7): This letter serves as the MTF‘s authorization to schedule the CFE‘s referral.    It  also  expresses  the  Commander‘s  acknowledgement  that  his/her  unit‘s funds will be used for payment of the exam. 5.3.2.2.2.  Instructions  to  the  Unit  Resource  Advisor  (Attachment  7):   This information sheet explains to the employee‘s Unit Resource Advisor the steps he/she must  take  in  order  for  payment  to  be  made  to  the  civilian  healthcare  provider.  Payment will not be made until the exam results are received by the MTF. 5.3.2.3.  Once  the  RMO  receives  the  Commander‘s  Authorization  of  Payment  for Civilian Medical Exam from the CFE‘s unit, a copy is provided to the MTF clinic.  The clinic may then schedule the employee‘s exam.  The clinic coordinates the appointment with  the  CFE‘s  supervisor,  recommending  the  supervisor  direct  the  CFE  to  attend  the appointment. 5.3.2.4.  The MTF clinic that scheduled the CFE‘s exam  must emphasize to  the civilian sector  provider‘s  office  that  results  of  the  exam  and  the  associated  invoice  for  full  and final payment must be sent to the MTF‘s Referral Management Center (be sure to provide the  address,  FAX,  point  of  contact  information).    The  bill  is  not  sent  directly  to  the employee‘s unit in order to avert Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (42 USC 1320d-9) (HIPAA) and Privacy Act of 1974, As Amended (5 USC 552a) (Privacy Act) violations, and to ensure the provider receives payment.   26  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 5.3.2.5.  The RMC will: 5.3.2.5.1.  Forward the exam results to the MTF provider that requested the exam. 5.3.2.5.2.  Forward the invoice for the exam to RMO. 5.3.2.6.  The RMO will: 5.3.2.6.1.  Verify that the invoice contains ‗Full‘ or ‗Final‘ payment on the invoice.  If the invoice does not state that it is for full/final payment, then RMO must contact the civilian provider‘s billing office in order to receive a revised bill. 5.3.2.6.2.  Process payment according to the option indicated by the employee‘s unit commander  on  the  bottom  of  the  Commander‘s  Authorization  of  Payment  for Civilian Medical Exam, and the Instructions to the Unit Resource Advisor. 5.3.2.6.3.  RMO will not proceed with payment until exam results are received by the MTF. 5.3.2.6.4.  Bases  with  pre-existing  agreements  between  the  Line  and  the  MTF  that already support execution of required non-DHP consults, studies, laboratory tests and medical examinations for civilian federal employees are not required to replace their agreed to practices in order to comply with this policy. 5.4.  Occupational  Medicine  Examinations.  Occupational  medicine  examinations  can  be categorized into two main groups:  Medical Surveillance Examinations (MSEs) and Fitness for Duty Examinations (FFDEs).  The MSE is primarily to determine if similarly exposed CFE and AD workers are adequately protected from exposures of concern.  The FFDE is to determine if workers are medically fit to perform in their assigned positions.  (DoD 6055.05-M, Occupational Medical  Examinations  and  Surveillance  Manual,  and  AFI  48-145,  Occupational  and Environmental  Health  Program;  AFI  48-123,  Medical  Examinations  and  Standards;  29  CFR 1910; 5 CFR 339) 5.4.1.  Medical Surveillance Examinations (MSEs): 5.4.1.1.  MSEs protect the health and safety of individual workers and groups of workers with  known  potential  hazardous  exposures  (e.g.  physical,  chemical  and  biological hazards).  Individual workers are protected by early detection of abnormalities associated with  exposure,  subclinical  illness  or  early  clinical  illness.    Early  detection  enables intervention  through  control  of  exposures  and,  when  appropriate,  medical  management.  Trend  analysis  of  exam  findings  for  similar  exposure  groups  is  essential  for  the identification  of  adverse  trends  and  preventive  intervention.    As  screening  tools,  MSEs represent an important part of AF medical surveillance. 5.4.1.2.  MSE  protocols  are  SEG  specific.    The  Clinical  Occupational  Health  Exam Requirements  (COHER)  form  (previously  known  as  the  AF  Form  2766  and  currently producible  in  Preventive  Health  Assessment  and  Individual  Medical  Readiness  (PIMR) program)  is  used  to  identify  MSE  protocol  content  by  defining  examination,  education and training requirements for the workers belonging to each SEG. 5.4.1.3.  Examination  requirements  are  driven  by  potential  workplace  exposures identified on the SEG specific OEHED summary document, the most appropriate action level, AF and DoD policy,  official standards (e.g. OSHA standards contained in 29 CFR AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   27  1910),  accepted  references  and  union  agreements  (e.g.  firefighters).  The  COHER  must clearly  identify  requirements  for  baseline,  periodic  and  termination  of  exposure surveillance  exams  and  all  relevant  references  (e.g.  OSHA  standards,  AF  and  DoD policy).   Certain  OSHA  expanded  standards  require  a  separate  termination  of employment  MSE  for  employees  who  remain  employed  by  the  AF  after  previously terminating  the  potential  for  further  exposure  to  a  covered  hazardous  exposure  (e.g.  by transferring out of a particular SEG). 5.4.1.4.  The IOEMC determines the MSE requirements contained in the COHER. He or she  must  be  medically  credentialed  to  certify  occupational  exam  requirements.    The COHER used to conduct an MSE must be signed and dated by the IOEMC.  Guidance for required or recommended immunizations may be included on the COHER. 5.4.1.5.  Basis for MSE protocols: 5.4.1.5.1.  Preparation of requirements begins with awareness of relevant guidance in OSHA  Expanded  Standards,  DoD  6055.05-M,  AFI  48-123,  AFI  48-145  and  this manual. 5.4.1.5.2.  PH assists with creation of COHER protocols by researching requirements and proposing protocol content. 5.4.1.5.3.  The  IOEMC shall have access  to  authoritative occupational  medicine  and toxicology  references  when  reviewing  MSE  requirements.    The  Navy  ―Medical Matrix‖  program  is  another  potentially  useful  source.    As  recommendations  may differ  by  source,  careful  study,  interpretation  and  medical  judgment  are  needed  to ensure  appropriate  exam  protocols.    When  questions  arise,  PH  and  BE  OEHWG members  can  explain  the  basis  for  their  recommendations.    The  USAFSAM consultant  service  provides  guidance  and  maintains  a  limited  number  of  exposure specific sample COHERs. 5.4.1.6.  Special actions required. 5.4.1.6.1.  Employees  must  be  notified  of  the  results  of  their  examinations  for  all MSEs.  They shall be advised to seek care from their personal health care provider for any incidental, non-work related conditions detected that require further evaluation or care. 5.4.1.6.2.  A number of the OSHA expanded standards (standards containing detailed instruction  re:    the  management  and  medical  management  of  hazardous  materials, contained in  29  CFR 1910) require specific actions (e.g. removal from  an exposure, written letter, testing etc.) when certain conditions are observed.  Notification letters to the supervisor and employee following routine exams are required for a number of exposures. 5.4.1.6.3.  When  special  requirements  exist,  the  COHER  protocol  must  include  an explanation. 5.4.1.6.4.  While letters from the AF HCP to both the employee and supervisor do not have  to  be  sent  for  all  MSEs,  this  is  done  at  the  Air  Logistics  Centers  and  has  the benefits of ensuring compliance with OSHA standards and of providing a consistent means of ensuring both the employee and supervisor know and understand the results   28  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 of  the  MSE.    When  letters  are  sent,  in  addition  to  any  specific  OSHA  expanded standard requirements, the following content may be appropriate: 5.4.1.6.4.1.  Letter  to  supervisor:    the  actual  results  of  studies  and  labs  and  any medical findings and diagnoses are not included.  The supervisor is informed that the  CFE  or  AD  member  did  or  did  not  complete  the  MSE,  does  or  does  not require  further  work  up  or  return  visits,  does  or  does  not  meet  any  required certification  exam  requirements  (e.g.    Respirator  use  certification),  and  may  or may not return to full or restricted duty (if returned to restricted duty, limitations and duration are specified). 5.4.1.6.4.2.  Letter to the employee:  a summary explanation of the results of the examination,  studies,  labs  (when  applicable)  and  of  the  information  sent  to  the supervisor is included.  If the exam revealed a work-related illness for which the CFE or AD member was offered and chose to obtain care at the MTF, the illness is mentioned along with a recommendation to follow up in the appropriate clinic.  If  a  non-work  related  medical  condition  requires  further  work-up  and  treatment, the AD member is advised to seek care at the MTF and the CFE with his or her private physician.  Any relevant lab or study results are provided to the employee to take to his or her provider.  If additional work-up or treatment is needed in the AF MTF, the CFE or AD member is informed. 5.4.1.6.5.  Worker awareness of the reason for inclusion in the MSE program. 5.4.1.6.5.1.  Per  5  CFR  339.205,  employees  must  be  notified  in  writing  of  the reasons  why  their  work  position  requires  inclusion  in  the  MSE  program.    This requirement is accomplished by PH when it sends a copy of a new COHER to the SEG supervisor with an explanation of why it applies to the members of the SEG. 5.4.1.6.5.2.  PH asks the supervisor to post both the copy of the current COHER and the explanation, to keep copies for employees to access, and to require review by new employees during orientation. 5.4.1.6.6.  OSHA has provided mandatory medical monitoring guidance for a number of  known  exposures  (e.g.  lead,  cadmium,  noise,  etc.);  however,  many  hazardous chemicals are not specifically addressed by OSHA.  OSHA regulates these under the general  duty  clause  (sect  5)  of  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health    Act  of  1970 (codified  at  29  USC  651-678),  which  requires  employers  to  provide  employees ―employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm‖ (29 USC 654). 5.4.1.6.7.  Union  agreements  may  dictate  some  exam  content  and  services  provided.  CPS  at  the  base  level  knows  who  to  contact  for  copies  of  existing  agreements  that may  impact  MSE  content.    Union  agreements  are  legally  binding  but  are  subject  to change through the bargaining process. 5.4.1.6.8.  Baseline, periodic and termination MSEs: 5.4.1.6.8.1.  Baseline MSEs. 5.4.1.6.8.1.1.  Baseline  examinations  should  be  performed  prior  to  work  in  a SEG, but must be performed no later than 60-days after beginning that work AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   29  (30 days for baseline audiograms per AFOSHSTD 48-20). 5.4.1.6.8.1.2.  Having  baseline  data  can  be  very  useful  in  determining  if  (1) the worker can be safely placed in a SEG; (2) pathology not  caused by SEG exposures is present; (3) early pathology is beginning to emerge; (4) abnormal findings on later exams represent significant change. 5.4.1.6.8.2.  Periodic MSEs. 5.4.1.6.8.2.1.  Periodic  MSEs  are  typically  annual;  however,  some  exposures may  require  more  frequent  monitoring  per  OSHA  standard  (e.g.  lead, organophosphates).    Exam  compliance  is  regularly  monitored  at  the  HQ  AF Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health Council (ESOHC). 5.4.1.6.8.2.2.  MSEs  that  are  required  on  an  annual  basis  by  OSHA  must  be completed within 12-months of the last MSE (as specified in multiple but not all OSHA expanded standards).  OSHA does not recognize a grace period for these MSEs. 5.4.1.6.8.3.  Termination MSEs. 5.4.1.6.8.3.1.  Termination MSEs are normally performed when an employee leaves  a  SEG.    Depending  on  the  exposure,  there  may  be  allowances  for counting  the  last  periodic  examination  as  the  termination  exam  per  OSHA, DoD or AF  guidance.  Where not otherwise required, an MSE accomplished within 180-days of termination may serve as the termination examination. 5.4.1.6.8.3.2.  Some  OSHA  expanded  standards  require  a termination monitoring  examination  at  the  time  of  termination  of  employment  (e.g. asbestos within 30-days of termination).  These must be provided even if the employee  had  an  earlier  termination  exam  at  the  time  of  leaving  a  SEG  and has worked away from the exposure for months or years prior to terminating employment.  These employees shall be tracked  to  ensure the requirement  is met. 5.4.1.6.9.  Beryllium workers are those currently or who have previously worked in a SEG with documented exposure to beryllium at or above the AF medical monitoring action  level  for  beryllium  of  0.2  µg/m3.    They  receive  MSEs  annually  until termination of employment, regardless of removal from potential beryllium exposure.  If at the time of termination of employment the worker is within 90-days of the last MSE  for  beryllium,  that  exam  will  serve  as  the  termination  surveillance  exam  for beryllium.    Examinations  are  performed  IAW  guidance  documents  contained  in PIMR. 5.4.1.6.10.  MSE Scheduling. 5.4.1.6.10.1.  MSE  scheduling  is  normally  arranged  by  PH  in  coordination  with the  clinic  providing  the  examinations  and  the  IOEMC.    PH  maintains  good communication  with  the  supervisors  for  each  SEG  to  ensure  new  and  existing workers  obtain  timely  baseline,  periodic,  termination  and  when  applicable termination  of  employment  MSEs.    PH  works  with  workplace  supervisors  for each  SEG  with  required  MSEs  to  ensure  personnel  rosters  are  updated  every  6-  30  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 months in PIMR. 5.4.1.6.10.2.  Final decision authority for establishing a process to schedule MSEs rests  with  the  IOEMC;  the  local  scheduling  process  will  be  documented  in  the OEHWG minutes. 5.4.1.6.10.3.  PH tracks  MSE  completion  and  maintains  records  of  no show/cancellation rates for clinical surveillance, and coordinates with supervisors to maximize completion rates and to minimize impact on mission where possible. 5.4.1.6.10.4.  AF  HCPs  document  all  MSE  results  in  the  workers‘  medical records.    AF  HCPs  work  with  PH  to  communicate  results  of  MSEs  to  the individual  workers,  supervisor  and  OEHWG  within  time  limits  specified  by OSHA  and/or  AFOSHSTDs  (e.g.  OSHA  expanded  standard  for  Lead; AFOSHSTD  48-20  notification  requirement  for  a  permanent  threshold  shift  to hearing).  AF HCPs ensure scheduling of any required follow-ups and monitoring until completion is accomplished in their respective clinics. 5.4.1.6.10.5.  By the fifth work day of each month, AF clinics performing MSEs report to both PH and the IOEMC the number of outstanding MSEs that have not been closed out and completed within 4 weeks of the initial clinic visit. 5.4.1.6.10.6.  For AFRC Host Bases: 5.4.1.6.10.6.1.  The PH function in the BE/PH office tracks MSE completion rates;  conducts  trend  analysis  on  OEM  data;  trains  supervisors  and  shop representatives on OEM programs; provides recommended COHER protocols to a credentialed HCP for review and approval. 5.4.1.6.10.6.2.  The  Reserve  Medical  Unit  manages  the  OEM  program, schedules MSEs; verifies completeness of MSEs; reports findings of MSEs to members;  notifies  a  member‘s  supervisor  of  the  member‘s  fitness  for  duty; schedules, coordinates and assesses additional follow up exams, if necessary; identifies  and  coordinates  with  PH  fitness  and  risk  evaluations;  attends  the OEHWG;  and  manages  incomplete  and  overdue  MSEs  with  the  Unit Commander, First Sergeant, and Unit Health Monitor. 5.4.1.6.10.7.  There are two systems for scheduling exams, by SEG and by MSE anniversary: 5.4.1.6.10.7.1.  When  practical,  exams  are  arranged  to  correspond  with  the annual  review  of  the  COHER,  which  is  in  turn  tied  to  the  BE‘s  periodic surveillance  of  a  SEG.    Ideally,  the  workplace  assessment  takes  place  first; followed  by  the  next  scheduled  OEHWG  and  then  all  SEG  members  have their  annual  exam  the  following  month.    This  system  minimizes  non-compliance  and  the  need  for  more  frequent  examinations  for  a  whole  SEG when exposure and regulatory changes are identified as requiring a change to a SEG‘s COHER. 5.4.1.6.10.7.2.  At  some  workplaces  and  bases,  employees  are  frequently moved  between  SEGs  or  deployed.    It  may  be  more  practical  to  track employees  and  their  monitoring  exams  by  worker  MSE  anniversary.    When AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   31  appropriate,  active  duty  members  may  be  scheduled  for  both  a  preventive health  assessment  and  an  MSE  at  the  same  time.    However,  the  two  are distinct  exams  and  the  requirements  of  both  must  be  clearly  met  and documented  in  the  medical  record.    While  there  is  a  potential  for  some  time savings  and  some  redundancy  may  be  avoided,  adequate  time  and  attention must be taken to ensure both assessments are properly completed. 5.4.1.6.10.7.3.  Regardless of the scheduling system used for Category 1 and 2 SEGs, the current OEHED summary and the current MSE protocol (COHER) are filed in the worker‘s medical record at the time of the MSE (or uploaded to  the  electronic  medical  record  if  resources  allow).    For  deployed  settings, workers  who  belong  to  a  SEG  with  an  OEHED  should  have  a  copy  filed  in their  medical  record  (DD  Form  2766)  prior  to  departure  from  the  deployed location. 5.4.1.6.11.  MSE compliance rates are reviewed at the OEHWG, Aerospace Medicine Council and reported to the installation ESOHC.  Any SEG with less than 90% MSE currency  is  reported  by  PH  or  FM/OMS  to  the  Squadron/Directorate  CC  and  SEG leader. 5.4.1.6.12.  Failure of an employee to  submit to a required  MSE represents  a risk to the health and safety of the worker.  When there is no legitimate reason for failure to comply  (e.g.  extended  deployment  or  other  prolonged  absence)  and  after  repeated contacts  to  request  compliance  by  PH  or  the  clinic  scheduler,  the  HCP  may recommend in  writing to  both  the employee  and  the employee‘s supervisor removal of the worker from the SEG‘s hazardous exposures pending examination compliance. This  recommendation  is  included  in  the  employee‘s  medical  record  with  an explanation that the employee‘s failure to participate in medical monitoring interferes with  protection  of  the  employee‘s  health  and  safety  in  the  presence  of  the  potential hazardous exposures of concern. 5.4.2.  Fitness for Duty Examinations (FFDEs):  [Except where AD members are specifically identified, this section only applies to  CFEs;  fitness  for duty  of AD members is  covered in AFI 10-203, Duty Limiting Conditions]. 5.4.2.1.  Background: 5.4.2.1.1.  FFDEs  are  used  to  inform  supervisors  and  CPS  personnel,  enabling  them to make and execute appropriate administrative decisions (e.g. actions to  hire, deny, accommodate,  remove,  restrict  or  return  to  duty  a  CFE  with  a  known  or  alleged potentially  work  limiting  medical  condition).    Positions  requiring  an  FFDE  have essential functions that are safety, security, or both safety and security sensitive.  This means  that  if  the  worker  is  unable  to  perform  the  assigned  tasks  properly,  safety, security,  or  both  could  be  compromised.    A  FFDE  may  be  required  for  positions that have specific medical standards, physical requirements, or are covered by a medical evaluation program 5.4.2.1.2.  CPS  or  a  supervisor  typically  requests  an  AF  HCP  perform  a  FFDE  on  a CFE either via a formal written request (e.g. a new hire pre-placement examination or a  formal  fitness  for  duty  request)  or  through  an  established  policy  (e.g.  supervisors   32  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 are  provided  an  AF  HCP  recommendation  for  regular  duty  or  restricted  duty following  an  annual  firefighter  physical  or  whenever  a  new  medical  condition  is identified by the AF HCP).  CPS and the supervisor ensure the AF HCP is informed of  all  functional  requirements,  environmental  factors  and  any  applicable  medical standards that pertain to the CFE‘s current or applied for work position. 5.4.2.1.3.  When  an  AF  HCP  performs  an  FFDE,  he  or  she  assesses  each  identified potentially  limiting  medical  condition  relative  to  the  functional  requirements  and environmental factors of the position.  He or she determines what, if any, limitations or  restrictions  to  assigned  duties  are  needed  to  ensure  the  worker  can  safely  (i.e. without risk of harm to self or others) accomplish assigned job functions in the work environment.    The  AF  HCP  does  not  recommend  termination  or  separation  of  an employee. 5.4.2.1.4.  The supervisor or CPS, not the AF HCP, decides if recommended medical limitations and restrictions can and will be accommodated and whether a worker will be  retained  or  terminated.    They  determine  if  a  CFE‘s  request  for  reasonable accommodation will be supported or denied. 5.4.2.1.5.  If a CFE attempts to secure a benefit from his or her supervisor or the AF for  a  medical  condition,  the  CFE  should  obtain  an  examination  at  his  or  her  own expense outside of the AF (5 CFR 339.304). 5.4.2.1.6.  An  AF  HCP  must  not  perform  a  FFDE  on  a  CFE  for  the  purpose  of    determining eligibility for coverage under the Family Medical Leave Act. 5.4.2.1.7.  In  the  event  of  a  mishap  or  security  failure,  an  investigation  may  be requested  to  determine  the  appropriateness  of  fitness  recommendations  made  by  the AF  HCP.    It  is  important  to  have  adequately  documented  in  the  medical  record  the rationale for recommended restrictions or return to unrestricted duty. 5.4.2.2.  Sources of information required to perform FFDEs: 5.4.2.2.1.  CPS  or  the  supervisor  is  responsible  for  identifying  the  functional requirements,  environmental  factors  and  any  applicable  medical  standards  on  the Optional  Form  178,  ―Certificate  of  Medical  Examination‖  (OF  178)  or  equivalent form.    The  form  can  refer  to  an  attached  Position  Description  or  cite  a  specific medical standard.  A full copy of an applicable medical standard does not need to be attached,  but  the  AF  HCP  must  be  provided  a  means  of  accessing  the  medical standard  (e.g.  the  clinic  would  need  a  copy  [electronic  or  physical]  of  the  currently accepted version of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1582 ―Standard on  Comprehensive  Occupational  Medical  Program  for  Fire  Departments,  2007 Edition,  Occupational  and  Environmental  Health  Site  Assessment  Technical  Guide‖ for firefighter examinations; and a current and SG approved copy of the AF Technical Instruction Guide (TIG) for the same publication). 5.4.2.2.2.  The  CFE  is  asked  to  provide  the  AF  HCP  a  relevant  medical  history appropriate to the requirements of the position.  This will often require complete past medical, surgical and social histories.  However, a family history is not taken as this would be a violation of the Genetic Information Non-disclosure Act.  Additional past medical information may be needed: AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   33  5.4.2.2.2.1.  When the job involves safety or security sensitive activities, the CFE is  asked  if  he  or  she  has  any  active  Workers‘  Compensation  claims  or  Veterans Affairs  (VA)  accepted  conditions.    If  there  is  an  active  Workers‘  Compensation claim, he or she must provide the AF HCP a current summary of covered medical conditions  and  recommended  work  restrictions  from  the  treating  HCP  or  clinic and a copy of the most recent Workers‘ Compensation letter showing the accepted condition(s)  and  any  prescribed  work  restrictions.    If  there  is  an  accepted  VA medical  condition,  a  copy  of  the  ―VA  rating  decision‖  document  must  be provided to the AF HCP for review. 5.4.2.2.2.2.  If  the  applied  for  position  involves  a  security  clearance  or  requires continuous alertness, physical coordination, and good judgment in the interest of safety, the CFE is asked to report any history of drug or alcohol dependence and any  chronic  pain  conditions  treated  regularly  with  controlled  substances.    If previously  in  a  rehabilitation  program,  the  CFE  is  asked  to  release  all  discharge summaries for  review by  the AF HCP (review  may identify the need  for further information treatment  and  compliance).  Documentation of the objective portion of the exam includes observed functional abilities and deficits relevant to the CFE‘s job requirements and work conditions. to  confirm  adequate release 5.4.2.2.3.  When  requesting  additional  medical  documentation  from  a  CFE,  it  is appropriate to request that the employee arrange to have the information sent directly from the outside clinic, hospital or provider to the AF HCP to ensure the integrity of the information.  The CFE is responsible for any costs involved.  If a CFE refuses to release  requested  information  that  is  needed  in  order  to  determine  if  medical restrictions are needed to ensure safety or security, it is appropriate for the AF HCP to write  a  recommendation  to  CPS  and  the  supervisor  recommending  restrictions  to work  activities  in  the  interest  of  safety  (and  security  when  applicable)  pending  the CFE‘s release of the requested medical information. 5.4.2.2.4.  The AF HCP‘s clinical assessment must include review of any information provided by the CFE from his or her personal HCPs. 5.4.2.3.  Specific FFDEs and types of FFDEs: 5.4.2.3.1.  Formal FFDEs, including New Hire Pre-placement FFDEs: 5.4.2.3.1.1.  Requests  for  Formal  FFDEs  are  made  by  CPS  or  the  supervisor  in writing  and  are  accompanied  by  an  OF  178  or  equivalent  form.    As  described previously,  the  request  must  include  all  functional  requirements,  environmental factors  and  refer  to  any  applicable  written  medical  standards.    If  these  do  not appear  to  be  appropriate  to  the  position,  the  AF  HCP  contacts  the  supervisor  or CPS to work a resolution.  These requests are made when (unless otherwise stated in  DoD  or  AF  policy):    1.    A  newly  hired  CFE  is  assessed  to  determine  if medically qualified for an applied for position; 2.  An existing employee applies for a new position; or 3.  The supervisor questions the CFE‘s long term  medical capacity to safely perform the essential functions of his or her assigned position.  [Note:  A formal FFDE is not typically performed on a CFE who is expected to fully  recover  from  a  recent  illness  or  injury  or  who  has  a  condition  requiring accommodations  that  do  not  significantly  impact  performance  of  essential  job   34  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 functions.] 5.4.2.3.1.2.  The primary purpose for performing a Formal FFDE is to ensure the CFE  is  medically  qualified  to  safely  perform  the  essential  functions  of  the assigned  position  with  or  without  limitations  and  without  risk  to  the  health  and safety of the CFE and others.  However, the examination may also later serve as a baseline for assessments of whether or not a claimed injury or illness was caused or aggravated by factors of employment. 5.4.2.3.1.3.  Specific recommendations made by the AF HCP to the supervisor or CPS on the SF 78 or its  replacement are usually limited to  determining  whether the individual meets the medical requirements of a specific position and can, from a medical standpoint, perform the job capably and safely.  This determination falls into one of the following three categories: 5.4.2.3.1.3.1.  Medically  Qualified  -  The  AF  HCP  documents  ―Medically qualified without limitation.‖  The individual meets all medical requirements for  the  position  and  is  capable  of  performing  all  essential  functions  without risk to self or others and requires no functional or environmental restriction 5.4.2.3.1.3.2.  Medically  Qualified  with  Restriction(s)  -  The  AF  HCP documents  ―Medically  qualified  with  accommodation  of  the  following restrictions:‖  then  specifies  the  restrictions  (and  their  duration)  to  work activities that are necessary to allow the CFE to safely perform the functions of the job.  For example, a CFE with severe degenerative joint disease of the knee and who is assigned to a position where he is expected to climb stairs or a ladder could have a restriction of ―no climbing or descending steep stairs or ladders.‖  A potential accommodation would be the use of a lift or – provided climbing  (or  reaching  an  elevated  height)  is  not  an  essential  function  of  the job  –  reassignment  to  work  where  no  climbing  is  required.    The  duration  of the recommended restrictions should be specified.  Before making permanent restriction  recommendations,  it  is  important  to  contact  the  supervisor  to determine if the restrictions can be accommodated and if they would prevent performance of essential functions. 5.4.2.3.1.3.3.  Not  Medically  Qualified  –  this  recommendation  is  only  made when  there  is  very  clear  evidence  the  worker  has  a  medical  condition  that could  not  be  accommodated  to  allow  the  worker  to  perform  the  essential functions  of  the  job  (e.g.  severe  cognitive  disabilities  or  mental  deficits incompatible  with  essential  functions;  recurrent  non-compliance  with medication by a schizophrenic who handles hazardous materials or weapons).  Non-44U providers and those who have not previously recommended workers as  ―not  medically  qualified‖  will  consult  with  a  senior  AF  44U  (e.g.  the AFMSA  OM  Consultant  or  the  USAFSAM  OM  Field  Consultant)  before making this recommendation. 5.4.2.3.1.4.  If  permanent  restrictions  are  recommended,  the  examining  HCP prepares  a  case  summary  statement  in  the  CFE‘s  medical  record.    The  case summary is confidential medical information and is not routinely provided to the supervisor or CPS (Section 504, Public  Law 93-112, Rehabilitation Act  of 1973 AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   35  (29  USC  701  et  seq)  As  Amended,  DOD  6055.05  M).    The  medical  record contains  protected  health  information  that  cannot  be  disclosed  under  HIPAA without consent of the CFE. 5.4.2.3.1.4.1.  Case summary  content:   case summaries may later be required to validate a disability retirement application or a CFEs‘ Compensation claim, or as evidence in  a legal hearing.  The summary  includes a relevant  medical history and clinical findings (to include specialty consults, studies, labs etc.), an  assessment  of  the  prognosis  and  whether  or  not  the  CFE‘s  medical condition  has  reached  maximal  medical  improvement,  and  the  rationale  for the  recommended  work  limitations  and  duration.    The  case  summary  also contains the recommended limitations to work and their duration.  Finally, it explains  how  specific  essential  job  functions  cannot  be  safely  performed  if recommended restrictions are or are not accommodated. 5.4.2.3.1.5.  As previously mentioned, the supervisor or CPS, not the HCP, makes the decision to accommodate or not accommodate and to hire or terminate a CFE. 5.4.2.3.1.6.  Rules  regarding  the  role  of  occupational  medicine  in  the  reasonable accommodation  process,  as  well  as  for  medical  documentation  and  medical confidentiality in the accommodation process, are further addressed in Chapter 6 of AFI 36-2706, Air Force Equal  Opportunity Program,  Military  and Civilian, 5 October 2010]. 5.4.2.3.2.  Security Clearance FFDEs and Record Reviews 5.4.2.3.2.1.  The Personal Security Program requires initial and periodic review of medical records by an AF medical authority to ensure CFEs do not have a medical or mental condition or are taking a medication that would potentially make a CFE unfit  to  hold  an  existing  or  applied  for  security  clearance  (AFI  31-501).    These reviews may be requested by the employee‘s servicing security activity. 5.4.2.3.2.2.  Disqualifying  conditions  include  those  that  would  be  expected  to cause  defective  judgment  or  reliability  (see  DoD  5200.2-R  for  examples).    A review  may  reveal  the  need  for  additional  information  in  the  form  of  an  AF clinical  assessment  and/or  release  of  outside  clinical information  (such information is sent directly from the outside clinical source to the evaluating HCP to prevent potential alteration by the CFE). 5.4.2.3.2.3.  Additional  reasons  for  conducting  such  a  review  include  a  direct request from leadership or detection of a potentially disqualifying condition by a HCP  during  other  clinical  activities.    A  recommendation  to  suspend  a  CFE‘s access  to  classified  materials  is  made  to  both  the  CFE‘s  supervisor  and commander (or civilian equivalent).  Commanders have the authority to  suspend access to classified information.  Consults for a psychiatric assessment of a CFE must be done IAW the guidance provided elsewhere in this chapter. 5.4.2.3.3.  Surety  FFDEs.    Surety  workers  (including  AD  members).    Guidance  re:  medical requirements for Presidential Support Program (PSP) can be found in DoDD 5210.55  Department  of  Defense  Presidential  Support  Program  and  DoDI  5210.87 Selection  of  DoD  Military  and  Civilian  Personnel  and  Contractor  Employees  for   36  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 Assignment  to  Presidential  Support  Activities  (PSAs).  Guidance  re:    the  Personal Reliability Program (PRP) can be found in DoD 5210.42-R/AFMAN 10 – 3902 and AFI 31-501 Personnel Security Program Management.  The medical portions of these programs are managed under the direction of the local SGP. 5.4.2.3.4.  Medical Standard Based FFDEs 5.4.2.3.4.1.  Medical standards and medical guidance. 5.4.2.3.4.1.1.  A  medical  standard  is  a  written  description  of  medical requirements  for  a  particular  occupation  (e.g.  firefighter)  based  on  a determination  that  a  certain  level  of  fitness  or  health  status  is  required  for successful performance (5 CFR 339.104). 5.4.2.3.4.1.2.  Medical  guidance  in  the  form  of  potentially  disqualifying medical  conditions  and  recommended  medical  considerations  is  not  a  set  of ―requirements,‖  but  rather  information  to  assist  the  AF  HCP  in  considering those  medical  conditions  that  may  interfere  with  the  safe  performance  of assigned functions in the assigned workplace. 5.4.2.3.4.2.  When  an  AF  HCP  assesses  a  CFE  for  medical  qualification  and applicable  medical  standards  or  guidance  exist,  the  AF  HCP  must  individually assess each potentially disqualifying medical condition discovered relative to the functional  and  environmental  requirements  of  the  assigned  or  proposed  position (per  5  CFR  339).    This  requirement  applies  regardless  of  what  is  written  in  a published  medical  standard.    It  also  applies  to  potentially  disqualifying  medical and psychiatric conditions for which there may be no medical standard, based on the  knowledge  and  judgment  of  the  AF  HCP.    In  other  words,  a  CFE  is  not summarily restricted or disqualified based on a diagnosis or medical history. 5.4.2.3.4.2.1.  The  AF  HCP  must  provide  adequate  documentation  in  the medical  record  to  make  it  clear  he  or  she  assessed  each  potentially disqualifying medical condition and then determined whether that condition is incompatible with job requirements and safety.  As explained earlier, the AF HCP recommends work restrictions when appropriate.  When restrictions are recommended, medical qualification or disqualification is accomplished when CPS  or  the  supervisor  decides  to  accommodate  or  not  accommodate  the recommended restrictions. 5.4.2.3.4.2.2.  For  example,  a  firefighter  applicant  is  potentially  medically disqualified IAW the NFPA 1582 medical standard because of his history of coronary  artery  disease.    If  he  has  excellent  heart  function  he  would  not necessarily  require  a  work  limitation  or  be  medically  disqualified;  while  a CFE  with  an  ejection  fraction  of  40%  and  who  can  only  achieve  eight metabolic equivalents on a treadmill test would require specific and probably disqualifying  work  limitations.    In  other  words,  if  using  the  2007  version  of the  NFPA  1582,  the  AF  HCP  MUST  make  an  exception  to  the  written guidance  in  order  to  meet  the  above  requirement  to  perform  an  individual assessment.  This does not necessarily mean paying for tests and studies, but would require review of relevant medical information from the CFE‘s private AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   37  HCP. 5.4.2.3.4.3.  The  DoD  and  AF  have  published  medical  standards  for  various positions  and  functional  requirements.    For  example,  DOD  5200.2-R  describes psychiatric conditions that may be disqualifying for activities requiring a security clearance.    DoD  6055.05M  (2007)  provides  medical  standards  and  guidance  for DoD  civilian  police.    The  AF  has  published  ―Technical  Implementation  Guide 1582-07  for  NFPA  1582,  Standard  on  Comprehensive  Occupational  Medical Program for Fire Departments, 2007 Edition.‖ 5.4.2.3.4.4.  Medical  standards  can  change  on  a  schedule  independent  from  this publication  and  can  be  found  on  the  AF  and  DoD  electronic  publication  web pages  or  the  Occupational  Medicine  webpage  on  the  AF  Knowledge  Exchange.  The  AF  typically  adheres  to  the  OSHA  expanded  standards  which  may  direct questions to ask when assessing a CFE‘s fitness to participate in certain activities (e.g.  OSHA  Respirator  Medical  Evaluation  Questionnaire  (Mandatory)  29  CFR 1910.134  App  C).    OSHA  standards  are  updated  quarterly  and  can  be  found  at http://www.osha.gov/.  In some cases, the AF has more restrictive standards (e.g. Beryllium). 5.4.2.3.4.5.  All  AF  specific  medical  standards  and  similar  guidance  regarding potentially  disqualifying  medical  findings  and  conditions  must  be  formally approved by the AF/SG, AF/SG2 or AF/SG3. 5.4.2.3.4.6.  Published medical  standards may have modifications that have been bargained  with  a  labor  union.    The  local  CPS  normally  has  a  labor  relations representative who is aware of local union agreements that may pertain to an AF or  DoD  medical  standard.    (For  example,  medical  exam  requirements  for firefighters have been bargained locally). 5.4.2.3.5.  Disability Retirement Package Reviews and FFDEs. 5.4.2.3.5.1.  When a CFE applies for disability retirement or when it appears the AF must make the application on behalf of a CFE, CPS may request an AF HCP review  application  materials  and  make  a  written  statement  back  to  CPS commenting  on  whether  or  not  the  materials  provided  support  OPM  medical requirements  for  disability  retirement.    It  is  the  employee‘s  responsibility  (when capable)  to  obtain  and  submit  required  medical  information  in  support  of  his  or her application. 5.4.2.3.5.2.  The OPM criteria for disability retirement that pertain to the AF HCP review include:  sufficient medical documentation to support the conclusions that the employee has a medical condition that precludes useful and efficient service; the condition must be expected to continue for at least 1-year; and the employee cannot  be  retained  through  reasonable  accommodation  and/or  reassignment  to  a vacant position. 5.4.2.3.5.3.  The  diagnostic  or  clinical  impressions  must  be  justified  IAW established diagnostic criteria and the conclusions and recommendations must be consistent  with  generally  accepted  medical  principles  and  practice  (CRCRS  and FERS Handbook).   38  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 5.4.2.3.5.4.  If  the  reviewing  AF  HCP  determines  he  or  she  needs  to  perform  a direct clinical assessment, he or she may recommend CPS make a written offer to the  employee  (or  the  employee‘s  guardian)  to  have  the  AF  HCP  perform  that assessment  in  support  of  the  disability  retirement  application  at  no  cost  to  the employee.    If  the  employee  accepts,  CPS  sends  a  written  notification  to  the  AF HCP  requesting  the  examination  and  explaining  the  offer  was  accepted  by  the employee or guardian. 5.4.2.3.6.  Pregnancy and Fetal Protection Assessments. 5.4.2.3.6.1.  Fetal Protection/Reproductive Risk Program.  All workers, to include CFE, AD, and traditional reservists (TRs), both male and female, are made aware of  reproductive  risks  and  protective  measures  in  the  workplace  through  the appropriate  occupational  health  program  (e.g.  Hazard  Communication,  Hearing Conservation Program, and Radiation Protection).  A pregnant CFE may request an  individual  workplace  reproductive  health  hazard  exposure  assessment  and,  if potential  hazards  are  identified,  a  medical  consultation.    Those  desiring  these services should make an appointment to be seen in PH for assessment.  The fact that  the  AF  makes  available  individual  workplace  reproductive  health  hazard exposure  assessments  and  medical  consultations  does  not  confer  a  right  on  the employee  to  have  assigned  duties  altered.    Such  workplace  alterations  will  be made  in  accordance  with  the  needs  of  the  AF  and  with  legal  requirements.  Pregnancy  is  not  a  disability  and,  absent  complications,  does  not  entitle  the employee to a reasonable accommodation.  Additionally, HCPs refer all pregnant AD  members  to  PH.    (The  Pregnancy  Discrimination  Act  of  1978  (Public  Law 95-555, 92 Stat. 2076)) 5.4.2.3.6.2.  Pregnant AD and TR members. 5.4.2.3.6.2.1.  AF  HCPs  managing  a  pregnancy  notify  PH  at  onset  and recommend  limitations  on  an  AF  Form  469  IAW  AFI  44-102  (if  the pregnancy  is  being  managed  by  a  civilian  HCP,  the  civilian  HCP‘s recommendation is provided to the AF HCP who then completes an AF Form 469.  (TR Airmen provide the documentation to their medical unit following a similar process as AD with civilian HCP) 5.4.2.3.6.2.2.  In  coordination  with  PH,  the  AF  HCP  reviews  the  BE assessment  of  workplace  exposures  of  concern  relative  to  the  pregnancy  and then  recommends  appropriate  work  restrictions  to  the  supervisor.    The  HCP will make the final decision. 5.4.2.3.6.2.3.  All  pregnancy  related  AF  Form  469‘s  are  reviewed  by  an IOEMC  appointed  physician  prior  to  release  of  the  profile  to  the  member‘s commander.    The  reviewing  physician  ensures  recommendations  are  made that would adequately protect the worker and fetus from work place exposures and  that  work  restrictions  are  consistently  applied  where  possible  (variations are  expected  given  potential  maternal  health  conditions,  different  workplace factors  and  the  individual  medical  recommendations  of  the  obstetrics  HCP).  See AFI 10-203 and AFI 44-102 for additional guidance. AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   39  5.4.2.3.6.3.  Pregnant Civilian Federal Employee Voluntary Assessment. 5.4.2.3.6.3.1.  Pregnant  CFEs  who  elect  to  undergo  an  exposure  assessment and medical consultation are interviewed by PH.  If they work in an industrial environment,  PH  sends  BE  a  request  for  a  workplace  exposure  assessment (the  same  process  as  for  AD  members).    PH  drafts  a  letter  for  the  worker setting out  any recommended changes to the worker‘s duties in  a potentially hazardous  environment  and  forwards  the  electronic  copy  to  the  IOEMC appointed  physician.    The  CFE  is  then  scheduled  to  see  the  same  IOEMC appointed physician. (The employee is asked to bring any recommended work limitations previously provided by her obstetrics HCP.) 5.4.2.3.6.3.2.  After  review  of  the  BE,  PH  and  obstetrics  HCP  materials  and examination  of  the  CFE,  the  IOEMC  appointed  HCP  makes  any  necessary changes to the PH draft letter, ensuring it clearly identifies any recommended changes to the worker‘s duties and their duration. 5.4.2.3.6.3.3.  The authoring HCP signs and dates the letter and sends it to the employee  only  and  places  a  copy  in  the  medical  record.    The  corresponding medical  record  entry  is  subject  to  medical  confidentiality  rules.    Should  the employee wish to seek alteration of job duties based on the recommendations, the employee may provide a copy of the letter to the supervisor. 5.4.2.3.6.3.4.  The  HCP  may  send  work  limitation  recommendations  directly to the pregnant CFE‘s supervisor only if those recommendations are based on a  direct  threat  to  the  health  or  safety  of  the  worker  or  co-workers    (i.e.,  not based on fetal protection). 5.4.2.3.7.  Breast feeding. 5.4.2.3.7.1.  A  number  of  industrial  chemicals  and  medications  are  potentially transmitted in breast milk.  A small number of known chemicals are concentrated in  breast  milk  at  levels  higher  than  are  found  in  the  mother‘s  blood.    However, medical literature on the risk to breastfed children of industrial working mothers is very limited. 5.4.2.3.7.2.  AD and civilian mothers returning from maternity leave who plan to continue  breast  feeding  and  to  resume  work  in  a  SEG  with  hazardous  chemical exposures are reminded of the option to see PH for an assessment. 5.4.2.3.7.3.  After interviewing a breast feeding worker, PH consults with BE and then  the  IOEMC  appointed  HCP  who  will  determine  what  (if  any)  work limitations are recommended.  These recommendations are provided in a written letter  to  the  employee  only,  and  a  copy  placed  in  the  medical  record.  These recommendations  are  subject  to  medical  confidentiality  rules.    Should  the employee wish to seek alteration of job duties based on the recommendations, the worker may provide a copy of the letter to the supervisor. 5.4.2.3.8.  Psychiatric FFDEs. 5.4.2.3.8.1.  Psychiatric Consults: 5.4.2.3.8.1.1.  Before  ordering  the  psychiatric  consult,  the  medical  record   40  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 entry  should  clearly  show  if  the  consult  is  being  ordered  or  offered  and  for what reason. 5.4.2.3.8.1.1.1.  Ordered  psychiatric  assessment.    The  AF  may  order  a psychiatric consult on a CFE only when (1) the CFE has already undergone a  general  medical  examination  and  it  is  found  that  there  is  no  physical explanation for actions which may affect the safe and efficient performance of  work  by  the  CFE  or  others;  or  (2)  a  psychiatric  examination  is specifically  required  for  medical  qualification  for  a  position  according  to written medical standards. 5.4.2.3.8.1.1.2.  Offering  a  psychiatric  assessment.    When  a  CFE  does  not meet the criteria to order a psychiatric examination, the AF may  only offer one to a CFE in order to make an informed management decision.  This may be  appropriate  when  a  CFE  requests  a  change  in  duty  status,  assignment, work  conditions  or  any  other  benefit  or  special  treatment  for  an  alleged psychiatric  condition  or  when  the  individual  has  a  performance  or  conduct problem which may require AF action. 5.4.2.3.8.1.2.  The consult may only be used to inquire into a person‘s mental fitness  to  successfully  and  safely  perform  the  duties  of  his  or  her  position without undue hazard to the CFE or others (5 CFR 339.301). 5.4.2.3.8.1.3.  A  CFE  who  claims  he  or  she  has  a  psychiatric  condition  that caused  a  behavior  at  work  or  necessitates  a  special  accommodation  is responsible  for  providing  supportive  medical  evidence;  the  CFE  is  asked  to have  all  relevant  medical  information  sent  directly  to  the  AF  HCP  from  the CFE‘s treating HCP. 5.4.2.3.8.1.4.  If,  after  review  of  the  CFE‘s  outside  medical  information,  the AF  HCP  determines  an  additional  AF  funded  consult  is  needed  in  order  to properly further assess the case and adequately advise the supervisor; or when a  CFE  is  exhibiting  behavior  that  warrants  psychiatric  assessment,  but  the CFE  is  unwilling  to  pay  for  an  evaluation  because  he  or  she  thinks  there  is nothing  wrong  with  him  or  herself  and  is  willing  to  submit  to  a  psychiatric evaluation;  then  the  AF  HCP  may  order  or  offer  (see  above)  a  psychiatric consult  (see  additional  criteria  below).    Psychiatric  functional  tests  alone (without  an  assessment  by  a  psychologist  or  psychiatrist)  are  inadequate evidence upon which to determine fitness for duty. 5.4.2.3.8.1.4.1.  Before offering or ordering a psychiatric assessment, the AF HCP must confirm  this can be provided in  the local  MTF or must confirm the  CFE‘s  unit  or  organization  will  fund  sending  the  CFE  to  an  outside mental health care provider (not telling the unit or organization the diagnosis or type of provider). 5.4.2.3.8.1.4.2.  If the assessment  is  offered, the  CFE‘s  choice to  submit  to or decline the exam is clearly documented in the medical record. 5.4.2.3.8.1.4.3.  When applicable, the CFE is asked by the AF HCP ordering the  consult  to  arrange  for  medical  summaries  to  be  sent  by  their  private AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   41  psychiatric  HCP(s)  to  the  mental  health  consultant  well  in  advance  of  the scheduled appointment. 5.4.2.3.8.1.4.4.  The  AF  HCP  consult  request  states  very  clearly  that  the consult is for the purpose of assessment only.  The consult request does not ask for or authorize treatment. 5.4.2.3.8.1.4.5.  The  work  requirements  and  environmental  factors  (e.g.  SF 78 and position description) are sent with the request. 5.4.2.3.8.1.4.6.  The  quality  of  the  evaluation  can  be  greatly  enhanced  by giving  the  consulting  psychiatric  HCP  approval  to  conduct  psychological testing if needed. 5.4.2.3.8.1.4.7.  The  consult  request  should  contain  an  explanation  of precipitating events.  (e.g. CFE reports receiving special messages from  an inanimate object in the workplace). 5.4.2.3.8.1.4.8.  The  consulted  psychiatric  HCP  must  not  be  the  CFE‘s treating  provider  and  preferably  has  no  direct  ties  or  obligations  to  the treating psychiatric HCP. 5.4.2.3.8.1.4.9.  The  following  questions  are  recommended  for  inclusion  in the  consult:    Has  the  CFE  been  and  is  he  or  she  responsible  for  his  or  her words and deeds? Is the CFE capable of consistently and safely performing assigned duties with or without specific limitations (if limitations, what are these  and  of  what  duration)?  Has  the  CFE  complied  with  recommended treatment?    Has  the  CFE  adequately  cooperated  to  allow  performance  of  a thorough assessment?  Did the CFE release all relevant medical information from  personal  treating  HCPs  and  programs  that  was  needed  for  this psychiatric assessment?  Did the CFE authorize the evaluating mental health care  provider  to  talk  to  his  or  her  supervisor?    What  is  the  diagnosis  and prognosis?    If  medications  have  been  prescribed,  please  explain.    Has  the CFE  reached  maximal  medical  improvement?    If  the  CFE  has  a  security clearance,  the  request  asks  if  the  CFE  has  the  judgment  and  ability  to consistently safeguard classified information.  If the CFE carries a weapon, works in a hazardous environment, or performs other safety sensitive tasks, the  request  should  include  questions  re:    safety  to  participate  in  these activities. 5.4.2.3.8.2.  Psychiatric referral. 5.4.2.3.8.2.1.  A referral of a CFE within the AFMS for psychiatric care may only  be  made  if  endorsed  by  the  IOEMC  after  confirming  a  work  related condition  exists  (in  consultation  with  a  psychiatrist  or  psychologist),  MTF resources support, AND when managing a Civilian Expeditionary Workforce (CEW) employee who qualifies for care per DoD guidance. 5.4.2.3.8.2.2.  Other  CFEs  with  psychiatric  illness  obtain  care  in  the  civilian sector at their own expense and apply for coverage through OWCP, DLHWC, or  a  supplementary  compensation  insurance  if  they  believe  their  condition  is   42  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 work related. 5.4.2.3.9.  Workers‘ Compensation Case Assessment FFDEs. 5.4.2.3.9.1.  The  AF  can  require  that  a  CFE  undergo  a  formal  FFDE  by  an  AF HCP for the purpose of determining appropriate work limitations that may affect placement decisions when the employee has applied for OWCP coverage of work related illness or injury.   OWCP must be notified when  a CFE fails to  show for the examination. 5.4.2.3.9.2.  When a CFE has an OWCP recognized treating physician for a work related  condition  other  than  the  AF  HCP  for  an  OWCP  accepted  medical condition, work limitations specified by the treating physician must be adhered to and less restrictive limitations must not be recommended directly by the AF HCP.  However, the AF HCP may recommend to  the supervisor and to  CPS additional or more restrictive work limitations. 5.4.2.3.9.3.  In accordance with 20 CFR 10.506, the AF cannot phone the OWCP treating provider to discuss or ask for information re:  an OWCP case, but may do so in writing or electronically (ensure the CFE has signed an approved release of information  both  for  the  content  of  the  letter  written  and  for  the  treating physician‘s  reply).    The  AF  has  a  right  to  request  and  obtain  copies  of  the treatment records in a compensation case without a release from the patient (AF HCPs  make  such  requests  through  the  Installation  Compensation  Program Administrator  or  through  the  OWCP  district  office).    Refusal  on  the  part  of  an employee  to  release  OWCP  related  information  or  to  submit  to  an  AF  ordered examination may adversely impact the CFE‘s future employment with the AF. 5.4.2.3.9.4.  The  AF  has  the  right  to  require  a  CFE  who  has  an  active OWCP/FECA claim to submit to a medical assessment performed by an AF HCP.  This  request  is  typically  made  of  the  CFE  by  his  or  her  supervisor  in  writing.  Refusal  on  the  part  of  an  employee  to  release  OWCP  related  information  or  to submit  to  an  AF  ordered  examination  may  adversely  impact  the  CFE‘s OWCP/FECA claim and future employment with the AF. 5.4.2.3.9.5.  If  an  AF  HCP  determines  the  OWCP  treating  physician  limitations are  inappropriately  restrictive,  he  or  she  can  send  a  written  explanation  to  the treating  provider  re:    the  ability  of  the  base  to  potentially  accommodate  the worker.  He or she can also make a written request to the regional OWCP district office asking for review of the case by the District Medical Advisor.  The request would summarize the clinical information and the rationale for calling the treating physician‘s  recommendations  into  question.    These  requests  should  be  routed through  and  approved  by  the  Centralized  Injury  Compensation  Program (AFPC/DPIRPC) who in turn may contact the CFE‘s supervisor.  The local CPS has contact information for the DPIRPC program. 5.4.2.3.9.6.  NAF  employees  fall  under  the  DLHWC  at  most  locations,  but  at some locations are under a separate insurance arrangement.  For NAF employees, seek  counsel  both  from  the  local  CPS  authority  and  the  Base  Legal  Office  (JA) and ensure there is a written request from CPS before assessing the legitimacy of AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   43  a NAF employee‘s compensation case restrictions. 5.4.2.3.10.  Non-work Related Medical Condition Assessment FFDEs. 5.4.2.3.10.1.  A supervisor or CPS may obtain medical advice from the AF HCP to  assist  in  determining  what  work  limitations  are  needed  for  a  CFE  with  or returning  from  an  absence  due  to  a  non-work  related  illness,  injury  or  recent surgical  procedure.    A  supervisor  or  CPS  may  request  an  assessment  by  an  AF HCP  when  either  believes  the  CFE  may  be  medically  unfit  to  safely  perform assigned duties and the employee agrees to the assessment. 5.4.2.3.10.1.1.  Non-OEM  physicians  in  civilian  communities  may  have  a limited understanding of the principals of OEM.  Most are not  as familiar as the AF HCP with the work requirements and work environment of AF CFEs.  Some  will  not  call  the  CFE‘s  supervisor  to  ask  about  work  requirements, conditions and accommodation of recommended work limitations.  They may not be concerned with expediting the return of the CFE to productivity. 5.4.2.3.10.1.2.  When an AF HCP evaluates a CFE‘s fitness to return to duty, he or she makes an independent medical assessment and provides appropriate recommendations  to  the  CFE  and  CFE‘s  supervisor.    It  is  not  appropriate  to simply  endorse  the  outside  provider‘s  recommended  limitations  without making a medical judgment as to whether or not the outside recommendation is appropriate. 5.4.2.3.10.1.3.  The  AF  HCP  provides  the  CFE‘s  supervisor  or  CPS  the information needed to make a well informed decision about a CFE‘s fitness to safely  perform  assigned  duties  with  or  without  accommodation  of recommended work restrictions. 5.4.2.3.10.1.4.  Returning  CFEs  safely  and  expeditiously  to  productive  work not only benefits the AF but protects CFEs.  Workers subjected to prolonged sick leave are at risk for developing long lasting illness behaviors. 5.4.2.3.10.1.5.  Disagreement with local providers may sometimes be avoided by  notifying  them  early  on  of  the  AF‘s  ability  to  accommodate  work limitations  and  providing  copies  of  documents  showing  employee  functional requirements and environmental factors. 5.4.2.3.10.2.  AF  HCP  requests  for  medical  information  from  CFEs‘  private physicians. 5.4.2.3.10.2.1.  If  a  CFE  claims  to  have  a  medical  condition  or  to  have recently undergone a medical procedure, and has been referred by CPS or the supervisor to a AF HCP for assessment of fitness for duty, the CFE is required to  provide  the  AF  HCP  with  a  note  from  the  treating  HCP  containing:    the date  written,  the  treating  HCP‘s  signature  and  printed  name  with  contact information, the diagnosis, recommended work limitations and their duration (or a recommendation to return to regular duty). 5.4.2.3.10.2.2.  The  evaluating  AF  HCP  reviews  the  private  physician‘s diagnosis  and  recommended  work  limitations,  performs  a  focused  outpatient   44  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 clinical  assessment  of  the  CFE‘s  alleged  medical  condition,  reviews  the  job requirements  and  conditions,  and  then  determines  if  the  outside  HCP‘s recommended  limitation  are  appropriate  or  if  different  recommendations should be made to  the supervisor prior to  making  a recommendation to  both the employee and the supervisor. there the  duration  of is  a  question  regarding 5.4.2.3.10.2.3.  If the recommended limitations, the AF HCP may consult an authoritative text that describes the range of time expected following injuries and procedures (at the time of this writing, a DoD wide enterprise contract exists for the use of web-based MDGuidelines®).  The AF HCP may need to see additional information in  order  to  determine  appropriate  work  limitations  (e.g.  a  cardiac  ultrasound report to determine the ejection fraction and a cardiac stress test report prior to returning  a  post  myocardial  infarction  case  to  a  heat  stress  environment  or strenuous  activity)  and  may  ask  a  CFE  to  have  the  private  physician  send relevant  existing  medical  information  to  the  AF  HCP  at  the  CFE‘s  expense.  The AF cannot require medical tests of a CFE unless it pays for those tests (5 CFR 339). 5.4.2.3.10.2.4.  The AF HCP may request a written release from the CFE (on a form  approved  by the  MTF  consulting  JA  or  a  DD  Form  2870 ―AUTHORIZATION  FOR  DISCLOSURE  OF  MEDICAL  OR  DENTAL INFORMATION‖ per local procedure) to allow the AF HCP to send a letter or talk directly to the outside HCP in order to explain work requirements and potential  accommodations.    The  AF  HCP  does  not  need  a  release  to  have support  staff  call  to  confirm  a  CFE  provided  note  was  truly  sent  from  the private physician‘s office or to send a copy of the work requirements in the SF 78 (or its replacement) and position description or a memo summarizing these requirements.    If  an  AF  HCP  fills  out  or  AF  support  staff  fill  out  a  records release  request  for  the  CFE  to  sign,  the  request  must  specify  ―A  family medical history and other genetic information is not requested.‖ 5.4.2.3.10.3.  Supervisor requests for treating physician medical information. 5.4.2.3.10.3.1.  A  supervisor  or  CPS  may  consult  with  an  AF  HCP  prior  to requesting a FFDE when a CFE claims a non-work related medical condition that necessitates reasonable accommodation of specific work limitations (e.g. inability to work night shift, to work in a particular area due to a phobia, etc) for an indefinite or prolonged period. 5.4.2.3.10.3.2.  If  the  AF  HCP  determines  outside  medical  information  is required  in  order  to  advise  the  supervisor  or  CPS,  he  or  she  may  ask  the supervisor or CPS to inform the employee in writing of the need to have the following information sent directly by the treating HCP to the  evaluating AF HCP (with a signed release): 5.4.2.3.10.3.2.1.  Copies  of  relevant  medical  records  (to  include  summary reports of specialty consultations, studies, labs, and record entries. 5.4.2.3.10.3.2.2.  A  note  identifying  the  relevant  medical  diagnosis  or AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   45  diagnoses, including the current clinical status, the patient‘s past and present compliance with recommended treatment, the prognosis (including plans for future  treatment),  an  estimate  of  the  expected  date  of  maximal  medical improvement, a list of all recommended work limitations and their duration; and  a  narrative  explaining the accommodations are medically necessary. the  conclusion the  basis  for that 5.4.2.3.10.3.2.3.  The  written  request  from  the  supervisor  or  CPS  to  the employee  must  state,  ―A  family  medical  history  and  other  genetic information  are  not  requested‖  and  a  statement  explaining  that  all documentation must be obtained at the CFE‘s expense. 5.4.2.3.10.4.  Upon  review  of  the  CFE‘s  medical  information,  the  AF  HCP determines  if  further  medical  or  psychiatric  assessment  is  needed  in  order  to provide the supervisor or CPS adequate information to allow for a well informed decision.    If  so,  the  AF  HCP  may  advise  the  supervisor  or  CPS  to  commit  unit funds to pay for the assessment.  An AF HCP must not order such an evaluation unless he or she has confirmation of unit funding.  Psychiatric assessments must only be ordered IAW guidance found elsewhere in this chapter. 5.4.2.3.10.5.  A request  from a supervisor  or CPS for  a medical  assessment  may be inappropriate if the issue is primarily administrative in nature (e.g. a CFE who is angry, argumentative, abusive, bullies others, exhibits a personality disorder, or exhibits other behavior most appropriately managed by administrative action). 5.4.2.3.11.  Fitness  assessment  during  other  clinic  visits.    In  a  broad  sense,  all employee medical examinations (including MSEs) are fitness for duty assessments: if findings  from  any  clinical  examination  are  incompatible  with  unrestricted  duty performance, the AF HCP recommends appropriate duty restrictions to the worker‘s supervisor (or commander). 5.5.  OEM Medical Care for work related illnesses and injuries: 5.5.1.  AD members obtain medical care for occupational injuries and illnesses through their assigned HCPs who take care of their day-to-day health care needs (MSEs for these members are  typically  accomplished  in  FM  or  OMS  clinics).    An  AD  member  can  be  referred  to  or sent for a consult from an AF OEM HCP where this service is available.  Industrial illnesses are brought to PH‘s attention for investigation and reporting. 5.5.2.  AF  CFE  medical  care  for  occupational  injuries  and  illnesses.    There  are  essentially three  systems  covering  work  related  medical  care  for  CFEs:      Office  of  Workers‘ Compensation Program (OWCP) under the Federal Employees Compensation Act of 1971 (5 USC Chapter 81) (FECA) which covers the majority of AF CFEs; Division of Longshore and Harbor  Workers  Compensation  (DLHWC)  which  covers  Non-Appropriated  Fund  (NAF) employees;  and  those  covered  by  other  forms  of  insurance.    As  there  are  differences  in eligibility,  means  of  applying  for  and  obtaining  reimbursement,  and  other  rules  and procedures, knowing the CFE‘s form of coverage is essential. 5.5.2.1.  Injury vs. Illness, OWCP definitions:   46  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 5.5.2.1.1.  An occupational injury is a medical condition that evolves over the period of  no  more  than  a  single  workday  or  shift  (e.g.  a  laceration).  (CA-810,  Injury Compensation for Federal Employees, 2009 Revised) 5.5.2.1.2.  An occupational illness is a medical condition that evolves over more than one work shift (e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome). 5.5.3.  If an eligible CFE seeks definitive and ongoing care for a work related condition at an AF  clinic  capable  of  providing  that  care,  the  CFE  must  make  a  written,  signed  and  dated decision to either choose the AF clinic or a private HCP as his or her OWCP treating HCP.  This statement is placed in the medical record.  The CFE has the right under FECA to choose to seek care from a non-AF HCP. 5.5.4.  If  an  employee  has  elected  care  for  a  work  related  condition  through  workers‘ compensation from a private HCP and a claim is pending or accepted, the AF HCP must not treat  the  CFE  for  the  claimed  condition  and  must  not  recommend  to  the  employee  or employee supervisor work limitations that are less restrictive than those recommended by the treating HCP.  The AF HCP must not phone the private HCP to discuss an OWCP case, but may communicate by other means while adhering to appropriate release requirements. 5.5.5.  Once  the  CFE  has  chosen  a  treating  HCP  and  has  notified  OWCP,  the  CFE  cannot change his or her OWCP treating HCP until he or she obtains written approval from OWCP. 5.5.6.  While the AF has a right to require a medical assessment of a CFE who has claimed a work  related  illness  or  injury,  the  AF  may  not  delay  required  care  in  order  to  obtain  that assessment (i.e. if the CFE has elected to obtain care outside of the AF). 5.5.7.  An  AF  provider  must  not  provide  medical  care  to  a  CFE  for  a  claimed  medical condition when the CFE has chosen a private HCP to treat that condition.  An AF HCP may review  work  limitations  recommended  by  the  private  HCP,  but  as  discussed  earlier  in  this chapter,  must  not  provide  less  restrictive  limitations  than  the  treating  HCP.    If  the  claim  is denied by OWCP, the AF HCP is not so restricted. 5.5.8.  OWCP  Forms.    An  acutely  injured  non-NAF  CFE  requiring  emergency  care  outside the  AF  MTF  obtains  an  authorization  for  payment  in  the  form  of  a  CA-16  from  his  or  her supervisor.  Application for a claim is made by the CFE on a CA-1 for injuries, on a CA-2 for illnesses, and on a CA-2A for a recurrence of an illness or injury. 5.5.9.  An  AF  HCP  who  has  been  chosen  by  an  injured  CFE  as  his  or  her  OWCP  treating provider  can  refer  a  case  to  a  specialist;  relinquishing  his  or  her  control  as  the  treating provider (the CFE is provided a choice of specialists who accept OWCP coverage). 5.5.10.  Illnesses  are  not  initially  covered  by  OWCP.    If  a  CFE  has  a  potential  industrial illness that cannot be worked up or cared for within the MTF, he or she must seek care at his or  her  own  expense.    Further  assessment  at  the  expense  of  the  employee‘s  unit  may  be appropriate when conditions described under section 5.2 are met. 5.5.11.  For both injuries and illnesses, OWCP determines if the condition is work related or not  and  decides  to  accept  or  to  reject  the  claim  (this  can  take  many  months  for  an  illness).  An AF HCP who determines a condition is or is not work related in opposition to an OWCP determination, may write to the OWCP claims representative who owns the case and request AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   47  review of the case by the OWCP District Medical Advisor.  This should be coordinated with the Centralized Injury Compensation Program (CPS can assist). 5.5.12.  The  AF  HCP  can  also  request  OWCP  assign  a  nurse  case  manager  to  a  case.    AF HCP‘s  are  not  to  counsel  CFEs  on  their  rights  and  coverage  under  OWCP  and  shall  refer patients  to  the  CPS  OWCP  representative  for  assistance  and  guidance  regarding  filing  a claim, forms  completion, and how to work with  private insurance companies to obtain care prior to OWCP acceptance or rejection of an illness claim. 5.5.13.  Emergency conditions requiring expeditious medical care may require the worker to postpone discussion with CPS until the condition or conditions are stabilized. 5.5.14.  Division of Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation (DLHWC). 5.5.14.1.  NAF employees with  an initial  work related injury or illness typically obtains care in the civilian medical community; they may be seen in an MTF if resources allow for  a  one  time  initial  evaluation  and  treatment.    A  DoL  form  LS-1  Request  for Examination and/or Treatment must be filled out as part of the visit. 5.5.14.2.  If seen in the MTF, the NAF employee should be referred to the CPS specialist who will assist in their transition to the care of a civilian provider.  NAF employees may receive pre-placement and formal  FFDE‘s from an AF  HCP when requested by CPS in writing and the MTF resources are sufficient to support (AFH 41-114). 5.5.15.  Other workers‘ compensation insurance for CFEs.  If a CFE requests care for a work related medical condition and is not covered by either OWCP or DLHWC, contact the local CPS for assistance. 5.6.  Occupational injury and illness reporting requirements. 5.6.1.  Medical record entry. 5.6.1.1.  The medical  record entry  for the initial  presentation  of an alleged work  related illness or injury not only documents assessment of the medical condition and appropriate medical  response,  but  provides  information  necessary  to  support  both  OSHA  reporting and OWCP claims determinations. 5.6.1.2.  The  medical  history  includes  the  time  of  injury  or  illness  detection;  location; CFE  activity  at  the  time  of  event;  mechanism  of  injury;  use  or  failure  to  use  PPE  and protective  measures;  contributing  factors  (e.g.  slippery  ground);  prior  health  status; earlier  evaluation  and  treatment  (if  occurred);  delays  in  reporting;  current  medications; any relevant pre-existing or past injuries, surgeries and illnesses; whether or not the event was witnessed; and duty title. 5.6.1.3.  If  the  CFE  reports  to  the  clinic  shortly  after  the  incident  and  appears  to  be intoxicated,  the  history  and  examination  attempts  to  determine  the  level  of  intoxication and potential impairment that may have contributed (performance of a toxicology screen may be subject to local policy, (e.g. for cause); or may be necessary in order to determine if it is safe for the employee to drive on base if he or she drove to work or the clinic). 5.6.1.4.  The  physical  exam  thoroughly  documents  objective  findings  and  may  include non-physiological  findings  (e.g.  Waddell‘s  Signs),  medical  treatment  provided  and planned, further planned investigation (e.g. if an alleged chemical or ergonomic exposure   48  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 awaiting  PH  and  BE  assessment),  and  the  CFE  choice  of  treating  physician  for  OWCP claim purposes (either AF HCP/Clinic or private provider). 5.6.1.5.  When determining causality, the AF HCP must be aware that OSHA and OWCP criteria  for  determining  work  relatedness  are  not  equivalent.    OSHA  criteria  for  work relatedness are beyond the scope of this publication and can be found in 29 CFR 1904.5 (http://www.osha.gov/).    These  OSHA  criteria  must  be  applied  when  the  AF  HCP determines work relatedness in the AF Safety Automation System (AFSAS).  However, when determining causation in the medical record, the AF HCP uses the criteria outlined in the DoL FECA publication CA-810 Injury Compensation for Federal Employees; 2009 (http://www.dol.gov/). 5.6.1.6.  If  an  investigation  is  still  pending  and  causality  is  not  as  yet  conclusive,  or  if there is reason to doubt work relatedness, this is documented in the record entry.  As PH (with possible assistance from BE) will investigate illnesses, additional information may be forthcoming that may impact the determination of causality. 5.6.1.7.  If a condition  is considered or determined to  be not work  related, the AF HCP documents  the  determination  in  the  medical  record  and  refers  the  CFE  to  his  or  her private HCP for further care and does not continue to treat the condition. 5.6.1.8.  For an illness, if the AF HCP determines it is work related, he or she documents this determination in the medical record and may treat the condition if MTF resources are available to support.  Until the case is accepted by OWCP, any outside referral for care is at the patient‘s expense.  If a claim is disallowed by OWCP but the AF HCP is certain the claim  should  be  allowed,  the  AF  HCP  may  write  a  letter  to  the  district  OWCP  office providing  an  explanation  and  requesting  review  by  the  OWCP  physician  consultant.  Again, this should be coordinated through the Centralized Injury Compensation Program. 5.6.1.9.  For an injury, once a CA-16 is completed payment for treatment  outside of the MTF  is  covered  by  OWCP  for  up  to  60  days  pending  an  OWCP  decision  re:    claim acceptance.  If the CFE elects care within the MTF, this coverage would apply to referral out to specialty care. (CA-810) 5.6.2.  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Reporting. 5.6.2.1.  In accordance  with  29 CFR 1960.8(b)  and 29 CFR 1904.39, the AF reports  all civilian work related illnesses and injuries to the DoL.  Base Safety (SE) is the POC for this purpose and is supported by the local MTF. 5.6.2.2.  AD  members  are  considered  to  be  on  duty  24/7  for  the  purpose  of  injury reporting.    Unless  otherwise  specified  by  local  or  MAJCOM  policy,  supervisors  are responsible  for  completing  the  OSHA  301A  or  equivalent  form  for  all  work  related injuries and submitting the completed form through appropriate channels. 5.6.2.3.  All  work related industrial illnesses presenting to  the MTF are  entered into the Air  Force  Safety  Automated  System  (AFSAS)  by  PH  with  a  workplace  evaluation entered  by  BE,  and  a  final  determination  of  work  relatedness  entered  by  the  IOEMC designated AF HCP; SE accesses this information from AFSAS to meet the OSHA 300 log  requirement.    OSHA  criteria  for  work  relatedness  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this publication and can be found in 29 CFR 1904.5 (http://www.osha.gov/). AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   49  5.6.2.4.  OSHA does not require the OSHA 301A form or its equivalent to be completed by a medical person (OSHA Recordkeeping Handbook, OSHA 3245-01R, 2005), but this does  not  relieve  the  AFMC  HCPs  of  the  responsibility  to  do  so  when  required  by  their governing policy. 5.6.2.5.  When  the  OSHA  301A  form  or  equivalent  is  completed  in  clinic,  a  copy  is placed in the AF medical record. 5.6.2.6.  Privacy.    Under  the  below  circumstances,  the  clinic  must  coordinate  with  the local  Ground  Safety  office  to  ensure  CFE  names  are  not  placed  on  the  OSHA  301A  or equivalent form.  A separate, confidential list of the case numbers and employee names must be maintained to allow for updating the cases and in order to provide information if necessary and appropriately authorized.  The circumstances include: 5.6.2.6.1.  An injury or illness to an intimate body part or the reproductive system. 5.6.2.6.2.  An injury or illness resulting from a sexual assault. 5.6.2.6.3.  Mental illnesses. 5.6.2.6.4.  HIV infection, hepatitis, or tuberculosis. 5.6.2.6.5.  Needle  stick  injuries  and  cuts  from  sharp  objects  that  are  contaminated with  another  person's  blood  or  other  potentially  infectious  material  (see  Section  29 CFR 1904.8 for definitions). 5.6.2.6.6.  Other illnesses, if the employee independently and voluntarily requests that his or her name not be entered on the log. 5.7.  Investigating alleged workplace illness or injury. 5.7.1.  HCPs  may  consult  directly  with  BE,  PH,  and  SE  when  investigating  an  alleged workplace  illness  or  injury.    However,  PH  is  notified  of  all  illness  investigations  and provided  copies  of  any  relevant  written  information  to  avoid  duplication  of  effort  and potential contradiction. 5.7.2.  The IOEMC or their appointee has authority to determine what is/is not appropriate to an  investigation  and  is  the  local  medical  authority  who  determines  occupational  injury  and illness causality. 5.8.  Causality. 5.8.1.  As  previously  mentioned  in  this  publication,  OSHA  and  OWCP  criteria  for determining work relatedness are not equivalent.  AF HCPs who see CFE‘s in clinic need to follow  OWCP  criteria  when  determining  causality  as  described in  CA-810 (http://www.dol.gov).  Those determining causality in AFSAS must use criteria found in 29 CFR 1904.5 (http://www.osha.gov/).  Below is a brief description of criteria at the time of this publication, but review and familiarity with the above references is essential for each of the two types of causality determinations: 5.8.1.1.  For purposes of OSHA reporting:  An injury or illness is work-related if an event or  exposure  in  the  work  environment  either  caused  or  contributed  to  the  resulting condition or significantly aggravated a pre-existing injury or illness. Work-relatedness is presumed  for  injuries  and  illnesses  resulting  from  events  or  exposures  occurring  in  the   50  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 work  environment,  unless  an  exception  in  29  CFR  1904.5(b)(2)  specifically  applies (Providers determining work relatedness should periodically review the current version of this reference as CFRs are subject to potential change on a quarterly basis). 5.8.1.2.  OWCP makes the final decision to accept or reject a claimed medical condition as work related or not work related.  But the provider making a determination of causality must  understand  that  OWCP  considers  an  illness  or  injury  work  related  for  FECA employees if: 5.8.1.2.1.  An injury or factors of employment result in a medical condition through a natural and unbroken sequence.  This is called ―direct causation.‖ 5.8.1.2.2.  A  pre-existing  condition  (whether  or  not  previously  caused  by  work)  is worsened, either temporarily or permanently, by work-related factors.  This is called ―aggravation.‖ 5.8.1.2.3.  A work-related injury or disease hastens the development of an underlying condition.  When  the  ordinary  course  of  the  disease  does  not  account  for  the  faster than expected speed with which a condition develops.  This is called ―acceleration.‖ 5.8.1.2.4.  A  latent  condition  which  would  not  have  manifested  itself  when  it  did, were  it  not  for  conditions  of  employment  (e.g.  latent  tuberculosis  becomes  active secondary to an event at work).  This is called ―precipitation.‖ 5.8.1.2.5.  The  event  took  place  on  the  AF  base  during  duty  hours  (includes  an  AF parking lot or while eating at work or in AF housing). 5.8.1.2.6.  The event took place off the base but when operating a private auto in the course of performing work or when eating off base required as part of performance of duties. 5.8.1.2.7.  Exceptions include visiting the base after work hours for non-work related reasons and when engaged in union activities. 5.9.  First Aid and Supplemental Care to Allow a CFE to Complete a Shift.  As indicated in AFH 41-114, Military Health Services System (MHSS) Matrix, Section 37, the MTF commander can offer first aid services in order to permit a CFE to complete a shift. 5.10.  Genetic  Information  Non-discrimination  Act  (GINA)  of  2008  (42  USC  2000ff  – 2000ff-11).  It  is  unlawful  for  the  AF  to  fail  or  refuse  to  refer  for  employment  or  otherwise discriminate  against  an  individual  (CFE  or  applicant)  based  on  genetic  information  (i.e.  family medical history (FMH) and genetic test results of the individual or up to fourth degree relatives).  AF  HCPs  must  not  ask  for  or  take  a  FMH  when  performing  FFDEs.    For  CFE,  an  FMH  may only be taken and recorded as per the below exceptions: 5.10.1.  Medical care assessment.  A focused FMH can be taken when used for the specific purpose of assessing a medical condition for the purpose of determining appropriate medical care  and  disposition.    For  example,  a  patient  presenting  to  the  clinic  for  assessment  and treatment  of  chest  pain  could  be  asked  if  he  or  she  has  a  family  history  of  heart  disease  or diabetes  but  would  not  be  asked  if  he  or  she  has  a  family  history  of  cancer  or  history  of ―chronic medical conditions.‖  Per GINA, prior to the AF HCP requesting the focused FMH, the  CFE  must  sign  a  statement  for  inclusion  in  the  medical  record  that  verifies  the  CFE knowingly  and  voluntarily  agrees  to  provide  the  focused  FMH.    For  example:    ―I,  [John AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   51  Doe],  knowingly  and  voluntarily  choose  to  release  genetic  information  for  permanent inclusion in my medical record for the purpose of enabling [Dr. XXXX] to assess the medical or  potential  medical  condition(s)  for  which  I  am  being  assessed  today.    I  have  not  been coerced  to  provide  this  release.    This  information  is  protected  from  disclosure  to  my supervisory chain and may not be used to influence employment related decisions.‖ 5.10.2.  Wellness  programs:    genetic  information  collection  (including  FMH)  collected  in support  of  wellness  programs  must  meet  the  same  criteria  as  described  for  ―Medical  care assessment‖ above.  This information should be kept separate from the OEM medical record and should not be shared with the AF HCP. 5.10.3.  Genetic monitoring of the biological effects of toxic substances in the workplace can be performed only if the following are accomplished. 5.10.3.1.  The  employer  provides  written  notice  of  the  genetic  monitoring  to  the employee. 5.10.3.2.  The  employee  knowingly  and  voluntarily  provides  written  authorization  for monitoring before it begins. 5.10.3.3.  The  genetic  monitoring  is  required  by  Federal  or  State  law  and  is  compliant with Federal and State laws. 5.10.3.4.  The employee is informed of individual monitoring results. 5.10.3.5.  Only  aggregate  information  that  cannot  identify  specific  individuals  can  be shared with AF leadership. 5.10.4.  AF OEM Medical Records: 5.10.4.1.  FMH information (1) provided by the patient without solicitation is recorded in the  AF  OEM  medical  record;  (2)  if  taken  and  recorded  prior  to  publication  of  this  AF interpretation  may  remain  in  the  AF  OEM  medical  record;  (3)  must  not  be  used  to influence employment related decisions. 5.10.4.2.  When  making  an  Armed  Forces  Health  Longitudinal  Technology  Application (AHLTA)  clinical  encounter entry and when  a FMH is  not  included in  order to  comply with  GINA,  the  following  or  similar  text  is  entered  in  place  of    a  FMH,  ―No  family history taken IAW GINA.‖ 5.10.4.3.  Outside  medical  records  released  to  the  AF  HCP  which  contain  a  family medical  history  are  filed  in  the  AF  medical  record.    AF  HCPs  requesting  a  consult  in support of an OEM assessment  do not  ask for  genetic information  to  include FMH; the following  text  is  included  on  the  release  form,  ―A  family  medical  history  and  other genetic information is not requested.‖ 5.10.4.4.  Specimen  collection  for  the  purposes  of  identification  by  the  Armed  Forces Repository  of  Specimen  Samples  for  the  Identification  of  Remains  (AFRSSIR)  is exempted  by  GINA.    Collection  of  a  tissue  or  blood  sample  from  a  civilian  for submission to AFRSSIR is allowed by GINA. 5.11.  Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973  definitions  and  requirements  to  consider  when  making work limitation recommendations:   52  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 5.11.1.  A  ―qualified  individual  with  a  disability‖  means  a  person  who  satisfies  the  job-related requirements of the employment position he or she holds or is applying for, and who, with  or  without  reasonable  accommodation,  can  perform  the  essential  job  functions  of  that position. 5.11.2.  The  AF  must  make  reasonable  accommodations  for  the  known  physical  or  mental limitations of employees and applicants for employment with disabilities, unless providing an accommodation  would  create  an  undue  hardship.    (The  decision  to  accommodate  AF  HCP recommendations/limitation is determined by the supervisor, not the HCP). 5.11.3.  Details  about  medical  conditions  are  not  communicated  to  leadership  or  CPS.    For example, if a CFE is unable to perform essential job functions because of a heart condition, the  supervisor  may  be  told  the  CFE  is  not  fit  to  perform  specific  duties,  but  the  actual diagnosis and medications are not disclosed by the AF HCP without consent of and written authorization  from  the  CFE  (Reference  DoDI  6055.05  M,  AFI  48-123,  AFI  48-145).    Per HIPAA, the minimum amount of protected health information necessary should be disclosed (45 CFR 164.502(b), 164.514(d)). 5.11.3.1.  If the CFE wishes to be accommodated in the position, he or she will have to disclose sufficient medical information to establish that he or she has a disability and that the disability necessitates a reasonable accommodation.  In most cases, complete medical records  cannot  be  requested  because  such  records  may  reveal  information  that  is  not relevant the  employee  has  a  disability  or  needs  an accommodation.  Requests for medical information should be narrowly tailored to answer specific questions to help determine if the individual has a disability and/or if reasonable accommodation  is  needed  (and  if  so,  what  specifically  is  required  as  a  reasonable accommodation). to  determining  whether 5.11.3.2.  The  CFE  must  cooperate  with  the  supervisor/manager:  (a)  providing  the specifics  of  the  accommodation  requested  and  how  the  requested  accommodation  will allow the individual to  perform  the essential functions of the job; and (b)  providing the requested  medical  documentation  and  medical  releases.    Failure  to  provide  the information necessary to evaluate the validity of the requested accommodation will result in the denial of the request. 5.11.4.  Unrelated or incidental medical diagnoses are not disclosed to the CPS or supervisor.  However,  if  a  condition  is  discovered  that  is  expected  to  prevent  a  CFE  from  safely performing  the  essential  functions  of  his  or  her  job  on  a  permanent  basis  or  for  the foreseeable  future,  the  AF  HCP  makes  a  recommendation  to  the  supervisor  that  there  is  a need for a FFDE (without disclosing the diagnosis). 5.12.  Family  Medical  Leave  Act  of  1993  (29  USC  2601  –  2619),  (FMLA).  AF  CFE‘s applying for coverage under the FMLA (or similar local, state or federal law) in order to care for a  family  member  with  a  serious  health  condition  provide  FMH  information  as  part  of  the application.    However,  this  information  is  not  placed  in  the  AF  OEM  medical  record  of  the applicant  and  is  not  maintained  by  the  MTF.    This  information  must  be  placed  in  a  separate medical  file  where  it  must  be  treated  as  a  confidential  medical  record  by  the  appropriate  CPS specialist  who  is  responsible  for  its  protected  access,  maintenance  and  eventual  disposal.    The AF  HCP  is  not  allowed  to  serve  as  a  second  or  third  medical  opinion  in  these  cases  as  is explained in 29 CFR 825.307. AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   53  5.13.  Medical  Information  Access.  Medical  information  (medical  records,  forms,  letters, diagnoses, medications, etc.) for AF CFEs in general (as per the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HIPAA)  must  be  protected  and,  unless  specifically  allowed  by  official  policy  or  a  signed  CFE release,  access  denied  to  CPS,  inquiring  labor  attorneys,  supervisors,  commanders  and leadership. 5.13.1.  Medical  personnel  may  release  recommended  work  limitations  to  supervisors  and commanders without permission from the CFE but shall safeguard other information (DODD 1020.1, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Handicap in Programs and Activities Assisted or Conducted by the Department of Defense, 1982; Certified Current 2003). 5.13.1.1.  First  aid  and  safety  personnel  may  be  made  aware  if  a  medical  condition  is known to potentially require emergency treatment, but a HIPAA, compliant release shall be accomplished (29 CFR 1614.203; 29 CFR 1630.14). 5.13.1.2.  Application by the CFE for OWCP, LHWA, and disability retirement requires the CFE to sign a medical release. 5.13.1.3.  In  all  consultations,  CFE  privacy  must  be  maintained  IAW  the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973, As Ammended; the Privacy Act; HIPAA, GINA, FECA/OWCP, DoD and AF  policy,  OPM  policies  and  the  need  to  know.    OWCP  and  disability  retirement applications include signed releases.  Legal proceedings may require release documents.  Either the CFE signs a release or an official policy must authorize the release. 5.14.  Administrative Activities. 5.14.1.  OEM  Consult  Services.    AF  supervisors,  other  leaders,  and  official  functions  may require  OEM  consultative  services  in  order  to  make  informed  decisions.    Support  for  these services involving CFEs exists at bases with OMS clinics and to the extent resources permit at other base FM clinics.  Internal customers include MTF leadership, AF HCPs, PH, and BE.  External customers include SE, base leadership, Public Affairs, JA, CPS, base supervisors of civilian employees and others. 5.14.1.1.  The IOEMC guides the uniform and consistent application of occupational and environmental medical decisions and policies at the base level. 5.14.1.2.  The IOEMC ensures the MTF professional staff are briefed at least annually on the  industrial  hazards  and  potential  illnesses/injuries  experienced  by  the  population  that may be seen in the MTF. 5.14.1.3.  Where  resources  permit,  the  IOEMC  can  also  provide  the  following  advisory and consultative services: 5.14.1.3.1.  Current  and  complete  medical  and  technical  information  regarding specific medical and physical conditions or medical examination procedures relevant to  existing  or  proposed  physical  requirements  or  health-related  personnel management programs for base AF employees. (i.e.,  ergonomics; 5.14.1.3.2.  Technical  assistance  includes  advisory  opinions  in  medical  and  OEH areas response/disaster preparedness; workers‘ compensation; disability retirement; medical standards; Equal Employment Opportunity Commission cases; civil lawsuits, Merit System Protection risk  communication;  emergency   54  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 Board  challenges)  to  ensure  compliance  with  AF/DoD  policy  and  local/state/federal requirements.  The IOEMC participates in base level ESOH council meetings. 5.14.1.3.3.  Expert review and analysis of medical documentation and other materials submitted  by  the  AF  in  support  of  medical/physical  disqualifications  of  applicants; employees‘ restoration rights  under 5 U.S.C. 8151 following full or partial recovery from compensable on-the-job injuries; and requests for job accommodations or other special benefits related to accommodation of documented health conditions. 5.14.1.3.4.  Written reports on medical standards, medical policy issues, or individual medical documentation reviews as requested. 5.14.1.3.5.  Guidance  for  resolving  complex  medical/personnel  management  issues where there are no established guidelines or precedents, including, but not limited to the following: 5.14.1.3.5.1.  Advisory  opinions  clarifying  medical/psychiatric  issues  on  the continued  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  of  Federal  employees who hold top security clearances. 5.14.1.3.5.2.  Guidance  regarding  new  and  experimental  procedures  relating  to such  issues  as  vision  correction  procedures,  surgical  implants,  or  prosthetic devices, as a means of satisfying medical or physical qualification requirements. 5.14.1.3.5.3.  Reports recommendations of AF evaluation and clearance processes. to  condense findings,  analyses,  conclusions  and 5.14.1.3.5.4.  Research  and  analysis  of  complex  legal  and  medical  issues  in coordination with AF labor attorneys. 5.14.1.3.5.5.  Research  and  analysis  of  technical,  scientific  and  medical  data  in support of local policy development and program management. 5.14.1.3.5.6.  Research and analysis of materials, devices, tools, systems  prior to acquisition  in  order  to  advise  leadership  on  compatibility  with  human  systems integration. 5.14.2.  Protecting Our Workers and Ensuring Reemployment (POWER) Program (Formerly Safety,  Health  and  Return-to-Employment  (SHARE);  and  before  that,  the  FECA  Working Group). 5.14.2.1.  The Centralized Injury Compensation Program representative or CPS appointed liaison runs the POWER Working Group and administers the program. 5.14.2.2.  The  IOEMC  or  appointed  AF  HCP  prepares  to  participate  in  the  POWER Working  Group  by  reviewing  medical  cases  at  the  request  of  the  Centralized  Injury Compensation Program Liaison. 5.14.2.3.  The IOEMC or AF HCP provides medical advice regarding what the CFE can and  cannot  do;  whether  or  not  the  OWCP  assessment  of  causality  and  recommended work  limitations  appear  appropriate;  whether  the  condition  appears  to  have  reached maximal medical improvement, is expected to improve, resolve or deteriorate; whether or not the case should be challenged based on a determination that it is not due to factors of AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   55  employment or does not otherwise qualify; and whether or not  an OWCP case manager should be requested if not already assigned to move the case forward. 5.14.2.4.  If  the  review  reveals  the  treating  physician  may  be  inappropriately  limiting work  activities,  the  IOEMC  or  AF  HCP  may  need  to  contact  OWCP  as  discussed elsewhere in this chapter (AFI 48-145; DoDI 1400.25-V810). 5.14.3.  Case Management. 5.14.3.1.  Effective  case  management  of  CFEs  with  work  related  illnesses  and  injuries can  greatly  reduce  lost  productivity,  compensation  costs,  and  patient  morbidity  by helping the CFE  get  to appropriate  care  expeditiously.   Where  a nurse  case manager or Certified Occupational  Health Nurse (COHN) is  not  available, OWCP can be contacted to  request  assignment  of  an  OWCP  nurse  case  manager  (for  accepted  OWCP  claims cases). 5.14.3.2.  Communication  with  OWCP  is  arranged  when  performing  local  case management  to  avoid  conflicts  with  OWCP  nurse  case  management  activities.    An  AF case manager should not interfere with the activities of the OWCP case manager. 5.14.4.  Workplace Visits by AF HCPs. Visits to the workplace are invaluable to AF HCPs to acquaint them with the work demands and hazards of their patient population.  All Category-1 workplaces are visited annually by an AF HCP.  Knowledge gained visiting the workplace is  extremely  valuable  as  it  enables  appropriate  determination  of  work  limitations, surveillance exam protocols and illness/injury mechanism/causality. 5.14.4.1.  Workplace  Visit  Preparation.    The  HCP  contacts  the  workplace  supervisor  to schedule  the  workplace  visit.    A  joint  visit  with  the  BE  technician  is  ideal  but  not mandatory.    The  HCP  visit  is  best  performed  soon  after  the  periodic  BE  assessment.  Prior to the visit, the following information is reviewed by the AF HCP: 5.14.4.1.1.  The BE SEG summary to identify exposures of concern. 5.14.4.1.2.  Past OEM visit reports and any ongoing assessments. 5.14.4.1.3.  Toxicology and pathology associated with the exposures of concern (this information  can be found in  a number of online sources and toxicology  texts; many are familiar to BE). 5.14.4.1.4.  The most recent surveillance exam protocol (COHER). 5.14.4.1.5.  PH trend analysis. 5.14.4.1.5.1.  If  not  readily  available,  ask  PH  to  look  for  adverse  clinical  and surveillance information trends within the SEG. 5.14.4.1.5.2.  If  adverse  trends  are  identified,  medical  records  may  need  to  be reviewed to better identify what is happening (e.g. elevated liver functions might suggest exposure to solvents, several cumulative trauma illnesses may suggest an ergonomic problem). 5.14.4.2.  Conducting the workplace visit. 5.14.4.2.1.  The visit begins and ends with the workplace supervisor.  Explain to the supervisor the purpose of the visit (to ensure medical monitoring and medical care are   56  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 appropriate  based  on  workplace  hazards  and  controls,  to  assist  the  supervisor  in compliance with OHSA requirements) and to ask the supervisor if he or she has any questions  or  concerns  with  exposures  in  the  workplace  or  services  provided  by  the MTF.  Permission is asked to interview CFEs privately about any exposure concerns they may have (Confirm beforehand with CPS if the base has any union agreements that require Union notification prior to talking to civilian workers about their working conditions). 5.14.4.2.2.  An  essential  element  of  the  evaluation  is  validating  identified  physical, biological,  chemical  and/or  radiological  hazards,  effectiveness  of  OEH  controls  and assessment  of  work  practices.    It  is  particularly  helpful  to  have  a  summary  of  the recommended OEH controls (e.g. PPE, ventilation controls, worker rotation) from the most recent BE HRA to ascertain whether controls are used.  Better still is for the AF HCP or nurse to bring a BE technician along who can point out the hazards and the controls  and  identify  potential  weaknesses  in  the  controls.    If  possible,  take  two  or three  employees  aside  individually  and  ask  them  if  they  have  any  concerns  about work place exposures and protective measures (assuming verification of  notification requirements has been properly addressed as per the preceding paragraph). 5.14.4.2.3.  If  the  visit  is  conducted  in  response  to  a  particular  employee  complaint, the specific circumstances surrounding that complaint are thoroughly evaluated. 5.14.4.2.4.  At  the  close,  the  supervisor  is  informed  of  any  significant  findings, recommendations,  or  the  need  for  additional  research  or  assessment.    He  or  she  is reminded  that  PH  depends  on  the  workplace  supervisor  to  notify  PH  of  employees who  start  or  terminate  work  in  the  SEG  in  order  to  schedule  initial  and  termination MSEs.  A copy of the final report is supplied to the supervisor within 5-duty days of the visit. 5.14.4.3.  Workplace Visit Documentation. 5.14.4.3.1.  Sufficiently, thorough and timely documentation of the visit is important.  The  HCP  creates  a  written  report  including  the  name  and  phone  number  of  the workplace supervisor, the date and who conducted the visit, the amount of time spent at  the  workplace,  a  description  of  the  work  operations  and  work  practices,  the  PPE used, any findings of concern, the number of workers interviewed, what  concerns if any were voiced and any required actions. 5.14.4.3.2.  Safety  concerns  are  communicated  to  SE  and  exposures  of  concern  are shared  with  BE.    Illness  and  injury  clusters  or  trends  are  shared  with  PH.    All findings,  conclusions  and  actions  are  included  in  the  final  written  report  and  are presented  in  the  next  OEHWG.    The  original  report  is  sent  to  the  workplace supervisor and a copy attached to the next OEHWG minutes. 5.14.5.  Workplace visits by PH.  PH will conduct workplace visits as needed to investigate adverse  trend  results  based  on  OEH  surveillance  and  epidemiological  findings  and  on  a routine scheduled basis IAW AFI 48-145. 5.14.5.1.  Workplace  visits  may  be  done  in  conjunction  with  BE  and/or  the  AF  HCP  or nurse.    However,  it  is  often  beneficial  to  accompany  the  BE  personnel  on  the  closing conference with the workplace supervisor. AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   57  5.14.5.2.  PH personnel conducting the visit.  Workplace visits must be led by at least a 5-level PH technician (3-level PH technicians must be accompanied). 5.14.5.3.  Workplace  visits  will  primarily  be  an  opportunity  for  PH  personnel  to  learn processes  and  hazards  in  the  industrial  environment.    In  addition,  these  visits  are  an opportunity to offer assistance to the supervisor in their OEH training/education program, fit personnel  for ear plugs, verify compliance with  hearing protection devices and other PPE,  update  workplace  rosters,  and  inform  the  supervisor  and  other  personnel  on  their medical  surveillance  requirements,  responsibilities  for  reporting  injuries/illnesses  and referring pregnant females to PH. 5.14.5.3.1.  Prior  to  the  visit,  PH  will  thoroughly  review  the  BE  shop  survey, pertinent  Material  Safety  Data  Sheets  (MSDS),  MSE  compliance  and  trend  analysis findings (based on a records review and audiogram reports), and occupational illness reports. 5.14.5.3.2.  PH  will  generate  a  report  with  MSE  compliance  and  trend  analysis findings and provide this report to the supervisor. 5.14.5.4.  Workplace visits will be documented in the OEHWG minutes and in the OEH-MIS, when possible. 5.15.  Civilian Expeditionary Workforce (CEW). 5.15.1.  CEW employees are required to pass a medical examination prior to deployment (see DoDI  6490.07,  Deployment-Limiting  Medical  Conditions  for  Service  Members  and  DoD Civilian  Employees  and  DoDD  1404.10,  DoD  Civilian  Expeditionary  Workforce  for guidance and criteria). 5.15.2.  Pre-  and  post-deployment  questionnaires  and  deployment  monitoring  of  CEW civilians is conducted through PH as required in DoDI 6490.03, Deployment Health. 5.15.3.  As per DoDD 1404.10, CEW employees who become ill, contract diseases, or who are  injured  or  wounded  while  deployed  in  support  of  U.S.  military  forces  engaged  in hostilities are eligible for medical evacuation and health care treatment and services in MTFs at  no  cost  to  the  civilian  employee  and  at  the  same  level  and  scope  provided  to  military personnel.    Upon  return  to  the  home  base,  CEW  CFEs  treated  in  theater  continue  to  be eligible for treatment in an MTF or civilian medical facility for deployment related illnesses, diseases, wounds, or injuries (at no cost to the CFE) pending claim adjudication by OWCP.  (See AFI 41-210 for a more detailed explanation of beneficiary status) 5.15.4.  CFEs who have returned from deployment and are subsequently determined to have a  deployment  related  compensable  illness,  disease,  wound,  or  injury  are  also  eligible  for treatment  in  an MTF at  no cost  to  the CFE pending adjudication by OWCP.  (See AFI 41-210) 5.15.5.  Upon  return  to  the  home  base,  these  CFEs  are  encouraged  to  meet  with  the appropriate OWCP representative in CPS as soon as possible to  file for OWCP coverage if this has not already been accomplished.  As mentioned previously, they must sign a note for the medical record documenting their choice of a treating provider (either the AF HCP or a private  civilian  provider).    They  have  a  right  to  seek  care  in  the  private  sector  rather  than   58  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 through the AF, but if they do this they are responsible for arranging for payment to include establishing a claim with OWCP. 5.16.  Travel Medicine.  AF CFE‘s scheduled for official TDY to foreign countries with known health hazards necessitating prophylactic vaccination or chemoprophylaxis, medical assessments and education may obtain these free of charge from an AF HCP.  PH assists by providing travel medicine information to the HCP. 5.17.  Education  and  Training  for  AF  HCPs,  nurses  and  technicians.  The IOEMC and full time  OEM  HCPs  attend  CME  conferences  on  a  regular  basis  to  maintain  currency  and appropriate certifications. COHNs have continuing medical education requirements. Physicians, nurses and technicians who perform or interpret spirometry in support of MSEs and FFDEs may be considered qualified to perform these duties by virtue of specialty training or certification by National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) or equivalent. 5.18.  OEH Surveillance and Epidemiology. 5.18.1.  PH collects and conducts trend analysis on OEH data to support OEHWG workplace review/worksite visits, and metrics for OEH program effectiveness and compliance (hearing conservation, pregnancy profiles, occupational illnesses), or as need arises. 5.18.2.  Trend Analysis should be conducted on: 5.18.2.1.  Medical  Records  (for  MSEs).    For  category  1  workplaces,  a  medical  records review of MSE findings is conducted using the following sampling plan: Table 5.1.  Records Review Matrix. # Personnel in Workplace < 100 101-200 201-300 301-400 401-500 >501 # of Records Reviewed 10  20 30 40 50 50 5.18.2.2.  Each  record  should  be  reviewed  for  compliance  with  MSE  requirements (frequency, content of MSE) and associated abnormal findings, and occupational injuries and illnesses.  In addition, visits to a HCP by workers enrolled in a MSE program should be reviewed for the past  year looking for potentially undiagnosed OEH-related illnesses (i.e., unexplained rashes possibly related to chemical solvents/JP-8, nose bleeds possibly related  to  hexavalent  chrome  exposure,  musculoskeletal  injuries  possibly  related  to workplace ergonomic issues, etc.). 5.18.2.3.  Trends  of  MSE  completeness  (#  of  records  reviewed,  %  of  records  with  all MSE  requirements  met)  and  %  of  records  indicating  abnormal  findings  should  be documented. 5.18.2.4.  Occupational  Illnesses/Injuries  (non-Hearing  Conservation  Program):    among assigned  workers  by  workplace,  calculate  the  #  and  %  of  workers  with  occupational illnesses (and injuries if available). AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   59  5.18.2.5.  Audiograms  for  the  Hearing  Conservation  Program:    By  workplace,  for  # annual  audiograms  conducted  within  a  one  year  period  (or  other  specific  time  period), calculate the # and % of significant and permanent threshold shifts (STS/PTS). 5.18.3.  The OEHWG should evaluate findings in  the context  of known workplace hazards, BE  recommendations,  PPE,  training,  and  available  historic  workplace-specific  data  and trends.    Where  adverse  trends  are  identified,  the  OEHWG  will  identify  a  plan  for  further investigation,  determine  underlying  cause(s)  (if  any),  document  findings  in  the  OEHWG minutes, and communicate findings and recommendations with the workplace supervisor or SEG leader and the unit commander. 5.18.4.  Program effectiveness:  Trends should be evaluated for the installation as a whole, as well  as  by  unit  and  workplace.    Analysis  might  include  stratification  on  other  available factors  (e.g.,  AFSC),  in  order  to  assist  in  targeting  prevention/education  efforts.    Historic data,  if  available,  should  be  used  as  a  comparison  when  evaluating  adverse/advantageous trends. 5.18.5.  Compliance  metrics  for  OEH  medical  data  might  include  MSE  compliance  rates, audiogram follow-up rates, and average pregnancy profile completion times.  At a minimum, MSE  compliance  should  be  tracked  and  reported  IAW  48-101,  and  other  AF  and  DoD guidance. 5.19.  Documentation  of  PH  Activities:  PH  will  maintain  OH  program  documentation electronically  whenever  possible.    All  interactions  with  industrial  shop/SEG  personnel  will  be noted  on  a  continuous  log  noting  at  a  minimum:    date,  who  was  contacted,  what  was discussed/accomplished, and any other pertinent information.  Pertinent information will also be annotated  on  the  log  whenever  a  shop/SEG  is  discussed  at  the  OEHWG  (e.g.,  OEHED,  MSE approval, trend analysis).  Entries will include the signature and signature block of the individual making the entry.  All other OH documentation will be maintained in the appropriate electronic database/format.    Protected  health  information  will  only  be  maintained  if  absolutely  necessary and  will  be  appropriately  protected  from  inadvertent  disclosure.    Additional  documentation maintained by PH will be up to local discretion.  THOMAS W.

The  results  of  these examinations  are  analyzed  to  determine  if  AF  operations  adversely  affect  the  health  of  the workers.    OEH  clinical  surveillance  is  also  required  in  specific  instances  to  meet  OSHA requirements  for  medical  monitoring.    Additionally,  clinical  surveillance  can  be  used  to  assess the  adequacy  of  protective  measures.    The  process  by  which  workers  receive  Occupational  & Environmental  Health  Medical  Examinations,  which  are  designed  and  conducted  based  on  an AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   67  assessment of workers‘ identified OEH risks. The results of these examinations are analyzed to determine if Air Force operations are adversely affecting the health of the workers. OEH clinical surveillance  is  also  required  in  specific  instances  to  meet  OSHA  requirements  for  medical monitoring. Additionally, clinical surveillance can be used to  assess the adequacy of protective measures. Occupational  Environmental  Health  (OEH)  Hazard  Characterization—  Process  for assessing  individual  OEH  hazards,  taking  into  accounts  factors  such  as  route  of  exposure, severity of OEH-related illness that may result from exposure, length of exposure, or duration of exposure. Personal  Protective  Equipment  (PPE)—  Use  of  PPE  shall  be  considered  last  in  the  control hierarchy unless other methods are not feasible.  This may be the case while engineering controls are  being  designed  and  installed,  or  during  non-routine  operations  including  maintenance  and emergency response.

Routine OEH Assessment— A qualitative and/or quantitative assessment conducted to identify and scope the processes employed to execute the unit‘s mission. (Source:  AFI 48-145) Severity—An  assessment  of  the  expected  consequence,  defined  by  degree  of  injury  or occupational illness that could occur from exposure to a hazard. (Source:  DoDI 6055.1) Similar Exposure Group (SEG)— A group of individuals for whom representative exposure of any  member  of  the  group  is  predictive  of  exposures  of  all  members  of  the  group.    The  term   68  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 ―SEG‖  is  formally  defined  in  the  AIHA  publication,  ―A  Strategy  for  Assessing  and  Managing Occupational Exposures.‖ Special  OEH  Assessment—  A  quantitative  assessment  that  focuses  resources  on  OEH-related hazards requiring additional evaluation or classification. (Source:  AFI 48-145) Time  Weighted  Average  (TWA)—  An  average  exposure  over  a  defined  time  period;  also referred to as time weighted average concentration. Unacceptable  Exposure—  A  condition  for  which  the  probability  of  adverse  health  effects  is significant, or there is evidence of adverse health effects associated with a specific OEH hazard. It  can  drive  actions  such  as  product  substitution,  implementation  of  new  controls  or  the enhancement of existing controls to attain an acceptable exposure. Uncertain  Exposure—  When  the  exposure  level/profile  of  a  hazard  is  not  well  characterized and the acceptability or unacceptability of a SEG‘s exposure assessment cannot be rendered.  It may be due to the lack of accurate and/or reliable data as well as an uncontrolled environment.  Will typically result in a need to capture more data to better understand an exposure and decide acceptability or unacceptability. Uniquely  Military—Equipment,  Systems  and  Operations  unique  to  the  national  defense mission,  such  as  military  aircraft,  ships,  submarines,  missiles,  and  missile  sites,  early  warning systems,  military  space  systems,  artillery,  tanks,  and  tactical  vehicles;  and  excludes  operations that  are  uniquely  military  such  as  field  maneuvers,  naval  operations,  military  flight  operations, associated  research  test  and  development  activities,  and  actions  required  under  emergency conditions. Workplace—Any environment where a potential OEH exposure may occur. A workplace may be administrative, industrial, or all encompassing, e.g., any setting where an OEH exposure may occur while deployed.  (Source:  AFI 48-145) Workplace  Supervisor—An  individual  with  the  authority  to  implement  controls  to  eliminate, minimize, or reduce OEH-related risk associated with a hazard in a workplace.  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   69  Attachment 2 DETERMINING CONFIDENCE IN OEH EXPOSURE CHARACTERIZATION A2.1.  All  criteria  for  a  given  category  must  be  achieved  in  order  to  apply  a  given  level  of confidence in hazard characterization.  If all criteria do not apply, move to the next lesser degree of confidence. A2.1.1.  HIGH:    High  confidence  means  the  medium  confidence  rating  supported  by sufficient  quantitative  evaluation,  or  detailed  technical  reports  where  environmental  factors do not influence exposure.  Further quantification is not required or the source of hazard does not  have  potential  to  generate  significant  exposures.    Sufficient  quantitative  data  has  been collected  to  draw  a  conclusion  about  exposure  acceptability.    Conclusions  with  high confidence  based  on  sampling  results  should  have  a  sufficient  number  of  random measurements (ideally 6 samples) to use statistics (i.e., 95% confident that the 95th percentile is less than the OEEL). A2.1.1.1.  Valid  monitoring,  i.e.,  air  sampling,  swipe  sampling,  scatter  radiation measurements, has been performed and no additional monitoring is required (other than periodic  monitoring).    Professional  judgment  has  been  correctly  applied  to  associate quantitative monitoring results to fully characterize the hazard being assessed. A2.1.2.  MEDIUM:  Medium confidence means potential health outcome based solely upon a detailed administrative and onsite review of activities within the workplace and  application of professional judgment supported by application of objective based engineering principles or  comparison  to  similar  DoD  and  or  private  sector  operations  (qualitative  or  quantitative).  Qualitative methods were used to characterize a low risk hazard, i.e., infrequent, insignificant contact with a mild skin irritant or low heat stress during mild work. A2.1.2.1.  Screening  samples  or  initial  air  sampling  results  are  within  acceptable  limits, but not totally conclusive; additional monitoring is required to increase confidence in the conclusion.    Qualitative  methods  were  used  to  characterize  a  low  risk  hazard,  i.e., infrequent,  insignificant  contact  with  a  mild  skin  irritant  or  low  heat  stress  during  mild work. A2.1.3.  LOW:    Low  confidence  means  potential  health  outcome  based  solely  upon  a qualitative  review  of  the  workplace.    No  quantitative  data  available  for  this  or  similar activities.  The source of the hazard has the potential to generate exposures above the action level.  Quantitative  data  does  not  exist,  or  is  insufficient  to  draw  a  conclusion  regarding exposure. A2.1.3.1.  The hazard has not been fully characterized. A2.1.3.2.  Qualitative assessment alone was used to initially characterize a medium/high risk hazard, i.e., skin absorption, significant ergonomic stress, exposure to carcinogens.    70  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 Attachment 3 DETERMINING CONFIDENCE IN CONTROLS A3.1.  All criteria for a given category must be achieved to apply a given level of confidence in controls.  If all criteria do not apply, move to the next lesser degree of confidence. A3.1.1.  HIGH:    High  confidence  in  controls  means  that  unacceptable  exposure  is  reduced through a combination of effective engineering controls and regulated area enforcement (as applicable).  The human element as related to control effectiveness has been almost entirely eliminated.    Engineering  controls/work  practice  controls  are  in  place  and  fully  operational.  Evaluations have been completed to demonstrate adequate exposure control. A3.1.1.1.  Hazard characterization has led to  a high confidence that the exposure is  less than the OEEL.  Controls are not required. A3.1.1.2.  Chemical  Inhalation  –  Exposure  is  controlled  below  the  AL  by  engineering controls  that  have  been  proven  effective  through  air  sampling  of  exposure,  and  that  are proven serviceable by periodic evaluation (i.e., quarterly ventilation surveys). A3.1.1.3.  Chemical  contact  and  absorption,  and  physical  hazards  –  Exposure  is controlled below exposure limits by engineering controls that are proven serviceable by periodic evaluation. A3.1.1.4.  Administrative  controls  are  in  place  to  prevent  access  to  regulated  areas  by unprotected, untrained personnel. A3.1.1.5.  Medical surveillance has identified no unacceptable dose, verifying controls are effective. A3.1.2.  MEDIUM:    Medium  confidence  in  controls  means  that  unacceptable  exposure potential exists, but is controlled by applicable method, administrative controls or PPE.  The human  element  effects  control  effectiveness,  so  unacceptable  exposure  is  possible  if appropriate use of controls is not enforced. A3.1.2.1.  Chemical  application  method  controls  exposure  (e.g.,  worker  uses  tongue depressor to apply sealant). A3.1.2.2.  PPE  is  required  to  control  exposure,  and  workers  have  been  observed  using required PPE effectively. A3.1.2.3.  Medical  surveillance  has  identified  no  unacceptable  dose,  verifying  controls are  effective;  or,  workers  have  no  medically  substantiated  complaints  of  symptoms associated with exposure. A3.1.3.  LOW:    Low  confidence  in  controls  means  that  the  exposure  is  not  adequately controlled,  or  a  reliable  conclusion  cannot  be  made  regarding  the  exposure  given  the information  or  data  available.    Controls  are  in  poor  a  state  of  repair/non-operational/not actively used.  Chemical inhalation exposure controlled by engineering controls that have not been proven effective through air sampling, or have been proven ineffective by air sampling. A3.1.3.1.  PPE is required to control exposure, but workers have been observed not using required PPE effectively, or using inadequate PPE (e.g., wrong type of glove). AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012   71  A3.1.3.2.  Regulated areas are accessible by untrained, unprotected personnel. A3.1.3.3.  Medical  surveillance  has  identified  unacceptable  dose,  such  as  temporary threshold  shift;  or,  an  occupational  illness/injury  report  has  been  made;  or,  workers complain  of  symptoms  associated  with  exposure,  such  as  skin  irritation  or  ergonomic strain which has been medically substantiated.    72  AFMAN48-146  9 OCTOBER 2012 Attachment 4 ADJUSTING 8-HOUR TWA EXPOSURE STANDARDS A4.1.  Mathematical  models  can  be  used  to  adjust  traditional  8-hour  work  schedules  to  non-standard  conditions.    Adjusting  exposure  standards  to  account  for  non-standard  schedules  can present challenges and no definitive consensus exists on the best way to adjust standards. A4.2.  Exposure  standards  do  not  represent  a  clear  boundary  between  safe  and  unhealthy exposure.  Typically exposure standards are based on health-related data and established with a conservative margin of safety.  Additional information regarding unusual work schedules may be found in American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist (ACGIH) TLV® Booklet. A4.3.  Brief and Scala Model: A4.3.1.  The Brief and Scala Model takes into account the number of hours worked in a 24-hour  day  and  the  period  of  time  between  exposure  events  and  may  not  be  applicable  in  all circumstances.  This  model  is  designed  to  ensure  the  daily  dose  for  the  toxicant  of  concern during  the  altered  work  shift  is  less  than  the  dose  for  a  conventional  work  shift.    This accounts for the decrease in time allowed for biological elimination of the toxicant. A4.3.2.  Information required: hours worked per 24-hour day.  The advantages of this method are: A4.3.2.1.  It is a simple calculation. A4.3.2.2.  It generates a conservative estimate of the dose. A4.3.2.3.  It requies no detailed knowledge about the substance being evaluated. Figure A4.1.
