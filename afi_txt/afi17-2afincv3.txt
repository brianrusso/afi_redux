Average Sortie Duration (ASD)— ASD is used to convert sorties to execution hours and vice versa.  MAJCOM/A3TB  uses  the  unit’s  last  programmed  ASD  when  initially  determining execution hour’s programs  for the current  and future  years. Units will update ASD annually to reflect  the  unit’s  best  estimate  of  the  optimum  sortie  duration  after  considering  historical experiences, changes in missions, deployments, etc. The formula to calculate ASD is ASD=# of weapon system hours employed divided by number of sorties. Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC)—  The  status  of  a  crewmember  who  satisfactorily  completed IQT and MQT to perform the unit’s basic operational missions, but does not maintain MR/CMR proficiency. Crewmember accomplishes training required to remain familiarized in all and may be  qualified  and  proficient  in  some  of  the  primary  missions  of  their  weapon  system  BMC requirements. These crewmembers may also maintain special mission qualification. Basic  Cybercrew  Qualification  (BCQ)—  A  cybercrew  member  who  satisfactorily  completed IQT. The crewmember will carry BCQ only until completion of MQT. BCQ crewmembers will not perform RCP-tasked events or sorties without instructor crewmembers. Certification—  Designation  of  an  individual  by  the  certifying  official  as  having  completed required training and/or evaluation and being capable of performing a specific duty. AFI17-2AFINCV3  23 MAY 2017 17 Continuation  Training  (CT)—  Training  which  provides  crew  members  with  the  volume, frequency,  and  mix  of  training  necessary  to  maintain  currency  and  proficiency  in  the  assigned qualification level. Crew Commander— Responsible for AFINC crew operations and provides command oversight for  operations  floor  personnel.  Enforces  compliance  with  policies  and  procedures  to  ensure successful mission accomplishment. Crew  Information  File  (CIF)—  A  collection  of  publications  and  material  identified  by  the MAJCOM and unit as necessary for day-to-day operations. Crew— Consists of a Crew Commander, Ops Controller and operators. Currency—  A  measure  of  how  frequently  and/or  recently  a  task  is  completed.  Currency requirements should ensure the average crew member maintains a minimum level of proficiency in a specific event. Cyberspace Operations (CO)— The employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace. Deviation—  Performing  action(s)  not  in  compliance  with  current  procedures,  directives,  or regulations. Performing action(s) not in compliance due to unusual or extenuating circumstances is not considered a deviation. In some cases, momentary deviations may be acceptable; however, cumulative deviations will be considered in determining the overall qualification level. Mission— Missions are operations conducted with an intended purpose. Missions are conducted by  a  unit  and/or  units  with  relevant  capability  and  preponderance  of  capacity.  The  base mechanism used to achieve mission objectives are sorties. Missions may require multiple sorties from multiple units to accomplish the mission objectives. Mission  Ready  (MR)—  A  crew  member  who  satisfactorily  completed  IQT  and  MQT,  and maintains certification, currency and proficiency in the command or unit mission. Non-current (NC) or Unqualified (UNQ)—crew may perform crew duties only on designated training or evaluation missions under the supervision of a qualified instructor/examiner. Qualification—  Designation  of  an  individual  by  the  SQ/CC  as  having  completed  required training and evaluation and being capable of performing a specific duty. Sortie— The actions an individual weapon system takes to accomplish a mission and/or mission objective(s) within a defined start and stop period. Target— The adversary, purposeful malicious actor code, or processes residing in blue or gray terrain.  Targets  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  processes,  code,  credentials,  storage,  and  the countering of adversary tactics, techniques and procedures designed to establish persistent access and C2. Task— A clearly defined action or activity specifically assigned to an individual or organization that must be accomplished as it is imposed by an appropriate authority.   18 AFI17-2AFINCV3  23 MAY 2017 Terrain—  The  cyberspace  area  of  operations  where  a  force  package  is  directed  to  conduct  a sortie. Terrain is defined as Internet Protocol (IP) address, domain, or transport space within the DoDIN or AF enclave (commonly referred to as "blue" space), or commercial, contractor-owned  mission  partner-owned  ("grey"  space)  host,  server,  and  network  devices  that  enable  C2, communication, sensing, and access capabilities. Time  Over  Target/Terrain  (TOT)—  The  exact  timing  requested  by  the  tactical  commander, directed  by  the  tasking  authority,  or  specified  in  the  tasking  order  to  prosecute  a  mission.  The TOT  is  based  on  the  available  Vulnerability  (VUL)  window  (can  be  an  enduring  or  time-sensitive  requirement)  and  must  be  executed  within  the  vul  window;  authorization  for  a  TOT outside a vul window can only be authorized by the tasking authority. Vulnerability  (VUL)  Window—  his  is  a  window  of  opportunity  and  direction  for  a  tactical commander  to  conduct  operations.  A  VUL  Window  is  bounded  (start  by/finish  by)  to  give  a tactical commander the authorized and suspensed timing available to plan and prosecute mission. Deviations from the assigned VUL Window must be approved by the tasking authority. Weapon System - A combination of one or more weapons with all related equipment, materials, services, personnel, and means of delivery and deployment (if applicable) required for self-sufficiency.
