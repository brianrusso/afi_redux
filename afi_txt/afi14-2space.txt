General.  Intelligence  roles  within  the  space  domain  encompass  multiple  mission  areas with varied and unique mission needs.  Requirements in this publication are intended to ensure a baseline  of  knowledge  and  skills  both  within  the  mission  areas  and  across  the  domain.    The guidance prescribed is the minimum and can be supplemented with unit-level written guidance, but cannot be less restrictive. 1.2.  Space  Intelligence,  Surveillance  and  Reconnaissance  (ISR)  Mission  Areas.  According to  the  Air  Force  Doctrine  Document  (AFDD)  3-14,  the  following  mission  areas  are  applied  to intelligence  roles  and  responsibilities  that  support  space  operations:    Global  Space  Mission Operations (GSMO), Space Support (SS), and Space Control (SC).  All three mission areas are supported by Space Situational Awareness (SSA). 1.2.1.  Space Situational Awareness.  SSA is fundamental to conducting space operations.  It is the requisite current and predictive knowledge of the space environment and the operating environment  upon  which  space  operations  depend.    SSA  involves  characterizing  the  space capabilities  operating  within  the  terrestrial  environment  and  the  space  domain.    SSA  is dependent on integrating space surveillance, collection, and processing; it includes threat and environmental  monitoring,  processing  and  analyzing  the  status  of  foreign,  US  and cooperative  satellite  systems;  while  monitoring  US  and  multinational  space  readiness;  and analysis  of  the  space  domain.    It  leverages  intelligence  sources  to  provide  insight  into adversary  use  of  space  capabilities  and  their  threats  to  our  space  capabilities  while  in  turn contributing  to  the  Joint  Force  Commander’s  (JFC)  ability  to  understand  adversary  intent.  SSA  is  a  key  component  for  space  control  because  it  is  the  enabler,  or  foundation,  for accomplishing  all  other  space  control  tasks.  SSA  can  be  divided  into  four  functional capabilities:    Detect/Track/Identify  (D/T/ID),  Threat  Warning  and  Assessment  (TW&A), Characterization, Data Integration and Exploitation. 1.2.2.  Global  Space  Mission  Operations.    In  Air  Force  doctrine,  the  mission  area  of  space force  enhancement as described in  JP 3-14, is  reorganized and renamed GSMO.  GSMO is comprised  of  force-multiplying  operations  delivered  from  space  capabilities  to  improve  the effectiveness  of joint  military  forces (air, land,  maritime, space, and  cyberspace)  as well as support  to  national,  civil,  and  commercial  users.    GSMO  capabilities  include:    ISR;  launch detection; missile tracking; environmental monitoring; satellite communications (SATCOM); and  positioning,  navigation,  and  timing  (PNT).    Space  operations  units  typically  operate military  and  national-level  assets,  including  satellite  payloads,  ground-based  radars,  and other sensors which collect information to support strategic-, operational-, and tactical-level decision making. 1.2.2.1.  RADAR  Operations  Support.    21  SW  operations  support  Space  Situational Awareness  (SSA)  through  various  RADAR  systems.    Intel  personnel  require  in-depth knowledge of both threats to and the capabilities/limitations of the specific radar systems they support. 1.2.2.2.  Command  and  Control  (C2).    C2  is  performed  by  the  Joint  Functional Component  Command  for  Space  (JFCC  SPACE)  Joint  Space  Operations  Center 6 AFI14-2SPACE  12 MAY 2016 (JSpOC).    The  JFCC  SPACE  Intelligence  Enterprise  (JSpIE),  which  combines  JFCC SPACE/J2,  14  AF/A2,  and  the  614  AOC/ISRD  personnel  under  one  leadership  and mission  focus,  supports execution  of  the JSpOC mission.   Required  training  consists  of both  U.S.  space  system  information  as  well  as  foreign  information  to  support  C2  and protection of all JFCC SPACE and 14 AF assets.  The Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations  Center  (JICSpOC)  creates  unity  of  effort  and  facilitates  information  sharing across  the  national  security  space  enterprise  in  conjunction  with  USSTRATCOM, AFSPC and the Intelligence Community (IC).  The JICSpOC supports JFCC Space along with the JSpOC. 1.2.2.3.  Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR)/Technical Intelligence Analysis.  Overhead Persistent  Infrared  (OPIR)/Technical  Intelligence  Analysis.    The  460  SW  and  it’s subordinates  squadrons  execute  this  mission.    These  units  create  technical  intelligence and  Indications  and  Warning  through  rapid  analysis  of  OPIR  data.    Foundational intelligence  and  long  term  analysis  are  the  purviews  of  the  National  Air  and  Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). 1.2.2.4.  Acquisition  Support.    Space  and  Missile  Systems  Center  (SMC)/IN  personnel require knowledge to support the acquisition of new space systems.  Required knowledge consists  of  currently  fielded  and  projected  systems,  current  and  emerging  threats  to fielded  and  projected  systems,  as  well  knowledge  of  space  ISR  operations’  limitations and  requirements. to  ensure  Intelligence Supportability  Analysis  (ISA)  is  performed.    They  may  leverage  support  from  SMC/IN and  SMC/SYEI  personnel  to  ensure  intelligence  supportability  needs  are  met  and  risks are assessed and documented, IAW AFI 14-111,  Intelligence Support to the Acquisition Lifecycle.   Program  Managers  are  responsible 1.2.3.  Space Support.   SS includes the essential  capabilities, functions, activities, and tasks necessary  to  operate  and  sustain  all  elements  of  space  forces  throughout  the  full  range  of military operations.  The SS mission area includes assured access to space, satellite support operations, and space support services. 1.2.3.1.  Spacelift Operations.   Performed by the  30 Space Wing  (SW) and 45 SW, this mission  area  requires  in-depth  knowledge  of  local  terrestrial-based  threats  and  force protection efforts to support successful launch operations. 1.2.3.2.  Satellite  Support  Operations.    50  SW  and  460  SW  Intel  personnel  require  in-depth knowledge of both threats to and the capabilities/limitations of the specific satellite systems they support.  Required knowledge addresses all components of the space system from ground to on-orbit. 1.2.4.  Space Control.  Air Force space forces execute SC operations to protect U.S. military and friendly space capabilities while denying space capabilities to the adversary, as situations require.    There  are  two  main  components  that  make  up  space  control:    Offensive  Space Control (OSC) and Defensive Space Control (DSC).  DSC and OSC are performed by select units of the 21 SW and members of the JSpIE.  This mission area requires robust knowledge of  satellite  communications  principles,  ISR  support  to  electronic  warfare,  and  non-kinetic targeting. AFI14-2SPACE  12 MAY 2016 7 1.3.  Position  Qualification.

Initial  Qualification  Training  Formal  Course.  The  Space  and  Missile  Intelligence Formal  Training  Unit  (SMIFTU)  [USAF  Education  and  Training  Course  Announcements (ETCA)  Course  ID:    ASOpS-SMIFTU]  is  the  primary  method  of  completing  IQT.    Course prerequisites are noted in ETCA IAW the formal course syllabus. 3.2.  In-unit IQT.  In cases where SMIFTU training is unavailable within a 90-day time period, units may request a waiver to conduct in-unit IQT.  AFSPC A2/3/6 is approval authority for in-house  IQT.    All  MAJCOMs  will  route  waiver  requests  including  the  following  information  to AFSPC A2/3/6 for approval: 3.2.1.  Justification for the local training in lieu of formal IQT. 3.2.2.  Summary of individual’s intelligence career field experience. 3.2.3.  Projected training start date and expected completion date. 3.2.4.  Requested exceptions to formal course syllabus, with rationale. 3.2.5.  Local MTP incorporating IQT. 3.2.6.  Training.   IQT will use the current formal courseware (T-2).   The  local  IQT plan of instruction must be included in an MAJCOM- (or NAF, if delegated) approved unit MTP (T-2).  Formal SMIFTU course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum requirements for  IQT;  additional  training  events  may  be  added  at  the  discretion  of  the  SIO  based  upon student proficiency, experience and/or non-progression. 3.2.7.  Evaluation.  Personnel completing in-unit IQT will be evaluated according to the same criteria  as  individuals  attending  SMIFTU  (T-2).    Failures  occur  if  the  course  exam  and/or task performance is not completed to minimum standards. 3.3.  IQT  Completion.  Once  all  training  and  associated  evaluation  is  complete,  the  individual has a status of Basic Qualification (BQ) 3.3.1.  IQT will be completed within the time specified by the SMIFTU syllabus (T-2). 3.3.2.  IQT  failures  require  notification  to  AFSPC/A2/3/6TT  (AFRC  notify  NAF/A2  and AFRC/A2)  with  the  person’s  name,  rank,  reason  for  failure  or  delay,  planned  actions  and estimated completion date (T-2).  Personnel on active duty status have up to 30 calendar days to  complete  remedial  IQT,  restart  the  local  IQT  course  or  enroll  in  the  formal  SMIFTU course.

USNORTHCOM—United States Northern Command USSTRATCOM—United States Strategic Command UTA—Unit Training Assembly UTC—Unit Type Code WGS—Wideband Global SATCOM WOC—Wing Operations Center Terms Lead  Command—Lead  commands  are  responsible  for  compiling  requirements  and  ensuring consistency  across  the  mission  set.    Lead  commands  act  in  coordination  with  all  affected MAJCOMs.  The term “lead command” does not refer to a particular organizational echelon (i.e., may be a MAJCOM, Field Operating Agency (FOA), Center of Excellence, Bureau, etc.). Lead  Command  for  Training—The  lead  command  for  training  is  the  command  tasked  with executing  formal  initial  qualification  training  (IQT).    The  lead  command  for  training  does  not have to be the lead command for the intelligence mission set (i.e. AETC, ANG, etc., may execute the formal course on behalf of the lead command). Senior  Intelligence  Officer  (SIO)—.    The  SIO  is  defined  as  the  Airman  responsible  for intelligence  functions  and  operations  within  an  organization.    This  is  the  highest-ranking  AF Airman within the organization that has: 1) been awarded an AF intelligence Specialty Code or civilian  occupational  series  and  2)  is  serving  in  an  AF  intelligence  position.    This  position  is synonymous  with  the  Chief  of  Wing  Intelligence  (CWI),  where  applicable.    Installations  with intelligence  activities  in  different  chains  of  command  have  separate  SIOs,  each  responsible  for the  intelligence  functions  and  operations  (or  activities)  of  their  units,  accountable  to  their commander and inspectable by their respective MAJCOM Inspector General.  AFI14-2SPACE  12 MAY 2016 35 SPACE QUALIFICATION TRAINING PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS Attachment 2 1.1.
