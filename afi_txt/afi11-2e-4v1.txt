(T-1) 1.3.7.  Communications Control Officers (CCO) must be grade O-2 through O-4, able to pass a Class-3 flight physical, complete physiological training and obtain a TS/SCI clearance prior to departing their previous duty station. (T-1) 1.4.  Training. 1.4.1.  Training is  designed to  progress  the  crewmember from  Initial Qualification Training (IQT)  or  Transition/Requalification  Training  (TX),  through  Mission  Qualification  Training (MQT) and finally to Continuation Training (CT). 1.4.2.  IQT qualifies crewmembers in a basic crew position and flying duty without regard to the unit's mission.  IQT academics will be provided by the FTU. 1.4.3.  MQT  qualifies  a  crewmember  in  the  E-4  mission.    MQT  includes  all  training, additional qualifications, and upgrades after a crew member’s initial qualification that is not encompassed by CT.  MQT is completed in the operational unit. 1.4.4.  CT  allows  crewmembers  to  maintain  combat  capability,  increase  proficiency,  and consists of mission-related training.  CT crewmembers are designated BMC or CMR. 1.4.5.  CMR defines an aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed initial and mission qualification  in  the  unit’s  primary  mission.    Pilots,  Navigators,  Flight  Engineers  and  Flight Attendants  are  initially  qualified  to  CMR  status.    CMR  crewmembers  maintain  proficiency and qualification in the E-4 mission. (T-3)  Failure to complete CMR required training results in designation as Non-CMR (N-CMR).  1.4.6.  BMC  positions  are  filled  by  experienced  crewmembers  whose  primary  job  is squadron/group/wing/NAF/MAJCOM  staff   These crewmembers provide additional sortie generation capability, either in lieu of or in addition to  CMR  personnel.    BMC  crewmembers,  because  of  their  high  experience  and  proficiency level,  have  a  reduced  training  level  requirement  compared  to  CMR  personnel.    BMC crewmembers  will  accomplish  all  ground  training  designated  by  the  squadron  commander. in  support  of  flying  operations. AFI11-2E-4V1  2 MARCH 2016 11 (T-3)    Failure  to  complete  BMC  required  training  results  in  regression  to  Non-BMC  (N-BMC) status.  1.4.7.  N-CMR/N-BMC.    Crewmembers  designated  N-CMR/N-BMC  are  not  combat  ready and must accomplish a tailored training plan to regain CMR/BMC. (T-3)  Crewmembers are designated  N-CMR/N-BMC  for  failure  to  meet  ground  training,  annual  flight  training,  or sortie lookback requirements IAW Table 1.1 1.4.7.1.  While  N-CMR/N-BMC,  aircrew  may  still  perform  flying  duties  (including exercises  and  contingencies)  in  which  they  are  current  and  qualified,  to  include Supervisor of Flying (SOF) duties. 1.4.8.  Unqualified (UQ).  Unqualified crewmembers require training and a flight evaluation to reach the next qualification level.  Crewmembers may be designated UQ for the following reasons: 1.4.8.1.  Enrolled  in  Initial  Qualification  Training  (IQT)  or  Requalification  Training (RQT). 1.4.8.2.  Non-Current IAW AFI 11-202V1. 1.4.8.3.  Demonstrated lack of ability. 1.4.8.4.  Downgraded for failure to meet standards during a flight evaluation. 1.4.9.  Experience Level Progression.  There are two experience levels for CT crewmembers:  Inexperienced  and  Experienced.    The  commander  designates  crewmembers  experienced based on progression guidelines and demonstrated proficiency. (T-3) 1.4.9.1.  Experienced pilots should have 200 hours E-4 time. 1.4.9.2.  Experienced navigators should have 200 hours E-4 time. 1.4.9.3.  Experienced flight engineers should have 400 hours E-4 time. 1.4.9.4.  Experienced Flight Attendants should have 100 hours E-4 time. 1.4.9.5.  Experienced CCOs, AMSO crewmembers, and SHF technicians should have 75 RAP sorties on the E-4. 1.4.10.  Instructor/Evaluator Qualified. Instructors/evaluators who become N-CMR/N- BMC may be allowed to continue academic and/or ATD instructor/evaluator duties, as long as they are current and qualified in the events being instructed or evaluated. 1.5.  Training Concepts and Policies. 1.5.1.  ACC/A3CN  provides  functional  area  management  for  E-4  training  programs  and validates training requirements. 1.5.2.  The  unit  will  design  training  programs  to  achieve  the  highest  degree  of  combat readiness consistent with flight safety and resource availability. (T-3)  Training balances the need  for  realism  against  the  expected  threat,  crewmember  capabilities,  and  safety.    This instruction provides training  guidelines and policies to  be used with  operational  procedures specified in applicable flight publications. 12 AFI11-2E-4V1  2 MARCH 2016 1.5.3.  ACC Training Support Squadron (HQ ACC/TRSS) will develop  and validate formal operations training programs and manage contract aircrew training/courseware development contracts as tasked by HQ ACC/A3. (T-2) 1.5.4.  Design  training  missions  to  achieve  combat  capability  in  squadron-tasked  roles, maintain  proficiency,  and  enhance  mission  accomplishment  and  safety.    RAP  training missions  should  emphasize  scenarios  that  reflect  operations  based  on  employment  plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition capabilities. 1.5.5.  In-flight Supervision: 1.5.5.1.  An instructor must supervise the following personnel  when performing aircrew duties: (T-1) 1.5.5.1.1.  Non-current  aircrew  members  while  performing  event(s)  to  regain currency. 1.5.5.1.2.  All aircrew members in initial, upgrade or requalification flying training. 1.5.5.1.3.  Unqualified crewmembers and senior officers as defined in AFI 11-202V1, and  any  other  staff  personnel  the  WG,  OG  or  SQ/CC  designates  as  required  to  fly with an instructor.  1.5.5.1.4.  For  unqualified,  non-current  or  senior  officer  pilots,  the  instructor  pilot must be at a set of controls during critical phases of flight, or when an individual is regaining currency or qualification in specific events. (T-1)  Note: Critical phases of flight  are  defined  as:  takeoff,  air  refueling,  approaches,  and  landing.    Air  refueling rendezvous/closures to pre-contact are not considered critical phases of flight. 1.5.6.  Training  Event  Tables.    Assign  crewmember  training  tables  according  to  their experience designation and RAP level. 1.5.7.  When  experience  designation  or  RAP requirements from the date of certification. level  changes,  prorate  new training 1.6.  Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Policy and Management. 1.6.1.  The primary means of assessing crewmember RAP qualification is the monthly RAP sortie  requirement.    The  breakout  of  sortie/mission  types  is  provided  as  a  guideline  to  be closely  followed,  but  minor  variations  are  expected.    Shortfalls  in  the  monthly  sortie requirement  are  the  basis  for  regression.    The  squadron  commander  determines  mission qualification after considering ACC guidance and the individual’s capabilities. 1.6.2.  An effective RAP training sortie requires accomplishing a tactical mission profile or a building block type sortie. 1.6.3.  The  squadron  commander's  first  priority  should  be crewmembers to CMR.  to train  all  designated 1.6.4.  Progression from BAQ to CMR requires:  1.6.4.1.  One month of continuation training meeting the CMR sortie rate. 1.6.4.2.  Confirmation  that  the  progressed  crewmember  can  complete  the  prorated number of event requirements to remain CMR at the end of the training cycle. AFI11-2E-4V1  2 MARCH 2016 13 1.6.4.3.  Completion of mission-related ground training. 1.6.4.4.  Squadron Commander Certification. 1.6.5.  One and Three-month Lookback. Table 1.1 defines the monthly sortie requirement for a crewmember to  remain mission ready.   If a  crewmember  fails to accomplish  the monthly sortie  requirement,  review  sortie  accomplishment  over  the  last  three  months.    Failure  to achieve the three-month sortie requirement may result in designation as N-BMC or N-CMR.  Reference  paragraph    4.5  Failure  to  Complete  Training  Requirements.    If  the crewmember  does  not  have  three  months  since  becoming  E-4  qualified,  the  monthly requirement must be satisfied.  1.7.  RAP Sortie Program Development. 1.7.1.  RAP sortie and event requirements apply to all crewmembers qualified to BMC/CMR.  RAP  Monthly  Sortie  Requirements  are  listed  in  Table  1.1,  and  are  defined  under  the appropriate crew position in Attachment 2.   1.7.2.  Requirements  for  X-Prefix  Fliers.    Requirements  for  X-prefix  flyers  assigned  or attached to the E-4B are identical to those listed in Table 1.1. Table 1.1.  Monthly Sortie Requirements.

The training folder  will  include  training  reports  (AF  FORM  4022,  Aircrew  Training  Folder,  AF  IMT 4023  Aircrew  Training Progress  Report,  AF  IMT  4024,  Aircrew  Training  Accomplishment Report,  and  AF  IMT  4025,  Summary  Closeout  Report,  or  locally  generated  training is initiated  for 14 AFI11-2E-4V1  2 MARCH 2016 documents), training guides, all waivers, and other records as applicable. (T-3)  The training documents are placed in reverse chronological order with the most recent on top.   1.8.1.1.  Formal  school  records  are  mailed  or  hand-carried  by  the  individual  to  the gaining  unit  during  in-processing  for  review  and  incorporation  as  applicable  into  the individual's initial training folder. (T-3) 1.8.2.  Training Folder Review. 1.8.2.1.  Operations  review.    The  squadron  commander,  operations  officer,  or  a designated  representative  will  review  active  training  folders  quarterly  and  prior  to  any flight  evaluation  required  to  complete  a  training  program  (not  applicable  for  formal school  training).  (T-3)    Operations  review  is  a  separate  entry  in  the  training  record  and should include comments on the student's progress.  Active training folders are folders of crewmembers  undergoing  initial/  mission  qualification,  requalification,  upgrade,  special qualification or certification (Alert A/C, FCF, RMI 1, DTWO, RAP, etc.), or commander directed additional training. 1.8.2.2.  Monthly review.  The unit training office chief or their designated representative will  review  active  training  folders  monthly  for  continuity  and  student  progression.  Document  this  review  and  any  recommendations  on  an  AF  IMT  4023  in  the  training folder. (T-3) 1.8.2.3.  Training  period  review.    Instructors  will  review  training  folders  prior  to  each training  event  (flight  or  ground)  in  order  to  develop  a  training  plan.  (T-3)    After  each period, instructors will document training in sufficient detail to accurately assess student performance and make recommendations for subsequent training NLT than the next duty day. (T-3)  At the satisfactory completion of all required training, the instructor will make a  recommendation  for  an  evaluation.  (T-3)    Students  will  review  and  initial  training records after each training period. (T-3) 1.8.2.4.  Maintain aircrew training folders for one  year following completion of training or  upon  completion  of  a  subsequent  upgrade  program.    For  example,  a  crewmember successfully completes IQT/MQT, and then 6 months later the crewmember successfully completes instructor upgrade.  At this time, his or her IQT/MQT training documents are purged  (IAW  AFRIMS  RDS  T  36  -  44  R  05.00,  Aircrew  Instruction  Records,  Flying Training Reports). 1.8.3.  History of Training.  1.8.3.1.  Documentation Procedures.  The flight  evaluation  folder (FEF)  maintains basic source documents to provide a current history of each individual's flying qualification in accordance  with  AFI  11-202V2,  Aircrew  Standardization/Evaluation  Program,  and appropriate MAJCOM Supplement.  Under the AF Forms 942, Record of Evaluation, in section  1  of  the  FEF,  all  other  certifications  (Alert  A/C,  SIOP,  TC1/2,  RM1/2  etc.)  are tracked  on  the  Letter  of  Certifications  (LOX),  IAW  11-202  V2.    Use  AF  IMT  1381, USAF Certification of Aircrew Training,  or MFR to identify those who have completed certification training.  1.8.3.2.  Letters  of  Qualification/Certification  not  recorded  on  the  AF  942  (Alert  A/C, SIOP,  etc.).    Destroy  when  entries  have  been  transcribed  to  permanent  records  i.e. AFI11-2E-4V1  2 MARCH 2016 15 HARMS,  ePEX,  letter  of  X’s,  FEF  on  AF  Forms  942,  or  AF  1381  (if  used)  IAW AFRIMS  RDS  T  36  –  44  R  06.00,  Aircrew  Qualification  Certificates  and  Training Information. 1.8.4.  Training Reports.  Prepare and forward training reports IAW MAJCOM directives. 1.8.4.1.  ARMS maintains flying and ground training records IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.    Use  ARMS  forms  prescribed  in  AFI  11-202V1,  to  document  training  in ARMS. 1.9.  Aircrew Utilization Policy. 1.9.1.  Commanders  will  ensure  crewmembers  (API-1/2/6s)  fill  authorized  positions  IAW Unit Manning Documents (UMD) and that crewmember status is properly designated.  The overall objective is that crewmembers perform combat-related duties. (T-1)  Supervisors may assign crewmembers to perform other duties but continually weigh the factors involved, such as  level  of  crewmember  tasking,  flying  proficiency,  currency,  and  experience.    Supervisors limit  the  non-flying  duties  to  those  related  to  combat  activities  for  inexperienced crewmembers in  the first  year of their initial  operational  assignment or those who have not completed  their  5-level  upgrade  career  development  course.    When  personnel  shortages occur, priority is  given to line unit-manning positions.  Aircrew will not perform long-term duties  that  detract  from  their  primary  duties  of  training  for  or  performing  the  unit’s  flying mission. (T-3). 1.9.2.  API-6/8 rated personnel flying authorizations and Test Unit aircrews will be IAW AFI 11-401  and  MAJCOM  guidance.    They  will  fly  the  BMC  sortie  rate;  however  they  are  not required  to  complete  BMC  specific  missions/events  or  meet  lookback  requirements.    Units should  provide  assigned  API-6/8  flyers  adequate  resources  to  maintain  minimum  training requirements.    However,  API-6/8  flyer  support  does  not  come  at  the  expense  of  the  flying squadron's  primary  mission.  API-6/8  flyers  will  accomplish  non-RAP  requirements  with allotted BMC sorties. (T-3)   If attached units cannot meet attached flyer requirements, they must request relief IAW AFI 11-401, ACC Sup.  Units requiring flying hour adjustments for attached API-8 and applicable API-6 flyers must request program changes IAW AFI 11-102, Flying Hour Program Management and associated MAJCOM supplement.  1.9.3.  Aircrew in DNIF status will continue to complete and log all required ground training events,  including  simulator  and  aircraft  generation,  and  those  activities  authorized  by  the flight  surgeon and documented on the member’s AF Form  1042,  Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty. (T-3). 1.10.  Sortie Utilization and Allocation Guidance. 1.10.1.  Inexperienced  crewmembers  should receive  sortie  allocation  priority  over experienced  crewmembers.    Priority  for  training  sortie  allocation  is  IQT/MQT,  CMR  and BMC. 1.10.2.  Maximizing  the  utilization  and  effectiveness  of  training  resources  is  critical  to producing  CMR  aircrew.    The  training  plan  for  each  sortie  (airborne,  ground  or  alert)  is thoroughly planned, and debriefed. 1.11.  Waiver Authority. 16 AFI11-2E-4V1  2 MARCH 2016 1.11.1.  HQ ACC/A3 is the overall syllabus waiver authority IAW ACCI 36-2252. (T-2)  A permanent  copy  of  all  waivers  and  syllabus  deviations  are  maintained  in  the  individual’s training folder.  1.11.2.  HQ  ACC/A3C  is  the  waiver  authority  for  all  other  provisions  in  this  AFI  unless specifically  noted  via  the  tiered  waiver  notation  at  the  end  of  certain  paragraphs.    Consult AFI  33-360  for  explanation  of  tiered  waiver  notations.    Waiver  requests  are  in  electronic form and will include the rationale for the waiver to HQ ACC/A3C. 1.11.3.  Waivers  are  submitted  and  approved  prior  to  the  crewmember  commencing  formal training or before training is completed as appropriate. 1.11.4.  Waivers to this instruction are valid until the end of the training cycle and should be renewed at the beginning of a new training cycle or as noted in the waiver. 1.11.5.  Continuation  ground  training  events  listed  in  this  instruction,  but  controlled  by another AFI adhere to all restrictions in the governing AFI. 1.11.6.  Provide  the  following  information  in  all  electronic  waiver  requests.    Asterisked  (*) items  must  be  provided  for  all  waivers.

Units will submit an annual report of all incomplete training to HQ ACC/ A3C (info copy to NAF/DO) by the last day of the month after the 12 month training cycle ends.  Prior to  submitting  the  report,  units  are  reminded  to  prorate  incomplete  training  as  detailed  in Chapter  4  of  this  instruction.  (T-2)    Reports  are  submitted  using  the  format  detailed  in Attachment  3.    Units  must  specify  the  reasons  for  training  not  accomplished,  and  whether failure to accomplish the training resulted in regression, retraining, or an OG/CC waiver. (T-2)  Units will submit negative reports as required. (T-2) AFI11-2E-4V1  2 MARCH 2016 17 Chapter 2 QUALIFICATION TRAINING 2.1.  Scope.  This chapter contains prerequisites and minimum training requirements necessary to prepare prospective crewmembers to perform duties in the E-4 aircraft. Pilots, Navigators, Flight Engineers and Flight Attendants combine IQT and MQT into one course of study.  AMSO IQT will  be  conducted  utilizing  syllabus  courses  at  a  Formal  Training  Unit  (FTU).    In  exceptional circumstances,  when  FTU  training  is  not  available,  AMSO  IQT  is  conducted  in-unit  IAW provisions  of  this  chapter.    Units  will  conduct  local  IQT  using  appropriate  formal  USAF Qualification  Training  Course  syllabus  tracks,  flow  programs,  and  requirements.  (T-2)    Units will utilize MAJCOM-approved local MQT syllabi to address each training program.  (T-2) 2.2.  Time Period to Qualify. 2.2.1.  Personnel will commence training no later than 45 days after date assigned to the unit conducting  the  training  and  will  complete  training  IAW  the  appropriate  syllabus.    Time limitations specified in Table 2.1, begin on the first day of entry into a training program. (T-1)  For AMSO crewmembers, treat each additional qualification as an initial qualification and apply the applicable syllabus and time limitations as specified in Table 2.1. 2.2.1.1.  Delays  in  initiating  training  beyond  the  45th  day  require  notification  to  the OG/CC.  Delays beyond the 60th day require notification to ACC/A3CN. 2.2.2.  Extension  of  Time  Limits.   If  training  is  not  possible  due  to  extenuating circumstances, (emergency leave, DNIF, limited aircraft) the time limits may be extended by the  number  of  days  resources  were  not  available  or  the  member  was  not  available  for training, with 55 OG/CC approval.  Provide as much training as possible to students who are DNIF or are in casual status. 2.2.3.  Upon entry into any formal qualification or in-unit upgrade program crewmembers are not normally granted ordinary leave, permissive TDY nor utilized for missions/TDYs that are not part of their training plan.  Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the appropriate squadron  commander.  (T-2)    Training  interruptions,  for  any  reason,  are  documented  in  the individual’s  training  folder.    With  unit  DO  approval,  students  may  conduct  primary  duties while enrolled in a course of training, but training events are given priority status. 2.3.  AMSO  Aircrew Development.  For first-term AMSO aircrew, the priority should be two- seat  qualification  and  then  instructor  upgrade.    After  this  and  if  resources  allow  it,  additional upgrades  may  be  considered.  Attachment  4  shows  the  ideal  training  plan  for  long-term sustainment.  This plan is only a guide and the squadron Training Review Panel is authorized to deviate from it when conditions warrant. 2.4.  Prerequisites/Ground Training. 2.4.1.  For students initially assigned directly to the FTU, the registrar will consult with the gaining  unit  prior  to  assigning  students  to  a  specific  class.    The  student’s  prior  experience, previous training and unit needs are considered in determining the specific training a student will receives.  18 AFI11-2E-4V1  2 MARCH 2016 2.4.2.  All  Category  I  requirements  in  Table  4.1  except  for  Operations  Plan  Study  and mission qualification should be completed prior to entering the IQT academic phase, but will be completed by the student prior to entering the flying phase. (T-3) 2.4.3.  All  E-4  aircrew  members  are  required  to  have  a  government  issued  passport.  (T-3)  Passport  applications  are  submitted to  the  1  ACCS  Flight  Attendant  office  no  later  than  30 days after being assigned to the FTU or operational unit.  2.5.  Qualification Training Requirements. 2.5.1.  Pilots and flight engineers complete an FAA-approved commercial training course for Boeing 747 aircraft, followed by in-unit IQT IAW the syllabus. 2.5.2.  The FAA-approved commercial training course consists of Aircraft General Systems, Normal  Procedures,  Abnormal/Emergency  Procedures,  and  Flight  Simulators.    The  flight simulators  allow  pilots  equal  time  in  each  seat,  with  the  flight  engineer  performing  panel operation  half  of  the  time  and  observing  the  other  half.    The  training  is  complete  upon satisfactory completion of an FAA simulator evaluation. 2.5.3.  Navigators receive IQT in-unit in accordance with the syllabus. 2.5.4.  Flight  Attendants  complete  an  FAA-approved  commercial  training  course  for passenger-type aircraft followed by in-unit IQT IAW the syllabus. 2.5.5.

CEA’s are exempt from maintaining OJT Training Folders (AF Form 623/623a,  Individual  Training  Record  Folder/On-the-Job  Training  Record  Continuation Sheet, IAW CFETP).  No other record of ground training is needed. 22 AFI11-2E-4V1  2 MARCH 2016 4.3.  Flying  Training.  All  aircrew  will  accomplish  the  events  shown  in  their  respective Continuation  Training  (CT)  Tables  (Table  4.3  -  Table  4.13)  each  fiscal  year  beginning  on  1 October through 30 September. (T-3) 4.3.1.  Flight  training  accomplished  during  IQT/MQT  is  not  creditable  to  CT  requirements, unless  member  is  qualified  in  events.    The  dates  that  events  were  accomplished  during IQT/MQT can be used to establish currency dates. 4.3.2.  Instructors  and  flight  examiners  may  credit  50%  of  their  total  training  requirements while  instructing  or  evaluating.    Exception:  Instructor  and  Flight  Examiner  pilots  may  not credit any takeoffs, landings, or air refueling flown by another pilot. 4.4.  Proration of Training. 4.4.1.  Training requirements for crewmembers that are not available for duties as outlined in AFI 11-202V1 are prorated.  4.4.2.  Enter the number of months a crewmember is  unavailable into the ARMS to prorate remaining training.  ARMS prorates the annual event table using the following formula: 4.4.2.1.  Events  remaining  =  Annual  Events  X  (#  months  available/12),  truncated  to  the nearest whole number. 4.4.3.  Crewmembers  completing  MQT  and  receiving  CMR  certification  during  a  given month  start  continuation  training  on  the  first  day  of  the  following  month.    Training accomplished  during  IQT/MQT  is  not  counted  toward  CT  requirements  remaining  after attaining CMR status.  Initial currency dates for recurring training events are established by the  date  of  the  AFI  11-202V2  evaluation.    For  events  not  accomplished  on  the  initial evaluation  (such  as  night  landings)  the  initial  currency  date  is  established  by  the  date  the event  was  last  accomplished  and  graded  proficient.    All  requirements  for  crewmembers departing PCS or separating are prorated to the last day of the month preceding the month of departure.  Refer to AFI 11-202V1, for further guidance.  4.4.4.  Flying and academic training requirements for crewmembers that are not available for normal duties are prorated according to Table 4.2 4.5.  Failure  to  Complete  Training  Requirements.  Individuals  who  fail  to  complete BMC/CMR  ground  requirements  listed  in  Table  4.1,  flight  requirements  listed  in  Table  4.3- 4.13, or One and Three-Month Lookback requirements listed in Table 1.1, may be designated N-BMC/N-CMR and have their recent training history reviewed by the squadron commander.  The squadron  commander  determines  what  training  is  necessary  for  the  crewmember  to  regain BMC/CMR status.  This make-up training is creditable towards the new training period.  If this review  indicates  a  proportionate/realistic  volume  of  the  BMC/CMR  events  were  recently accomplished that would ensure combat proficiency, the squadron commander may declare the individual BMC/CMR.
