This  publication  applies  to  Air  Force  Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) units. SUMMARY OF CHANGES This  publication  has  been  revised.    This  rewrite  of  AFPD  10-26  updates  Air  Force  policy  to maintain  consistency  with  DoD  CWMD  strategy,  doctrine  and  policy.    It  establishes  the  Air Force  CWMD  Enterprise,  and  it  outlines  the  organizational  responsibilities  required  to effectively  implement  DoD  CWMD  strategy,  doctrine  and  policy  throughout  the  Department, and  to  manage  the  Air  Force  CWMD  Enterprise.    It  updates  Air  Force  policy  regarding  the research,  development  and  acquisition  of  the  chemical,  biological  and  radiological  defense materiel  required  to  support  CWMD  missions  through  the  Chemical  and  Biological  Defense Program  (CBDP),  and  it  assigns  authorities  and  responsibilities  associated  with  Air  Force engagement  with  the  CBDP  and  its  constituent  organizations.  It  also  incorporates  and  updates Air  Force  policy  on  Biological  Select  Agents  and  Toxins  (BSAT),  assigns  authorities  and responsibilities  for  safeguarding  BSAT,  and  establishes  the  requirement  for  a  Biological Personnel  Reliability  Program  (BPRP).    Finally,  it  assigns  authorities  and  responsibilities associated with Air Force implementation of DoD CBRN survivability policy. 1.  Overview 1.1.  Many  of the potential  adversaries of the United States either possess  or seek to  obtain weapons  of  mass  destruction,  raising  the  possibility  that  these  weapons  could  be  employed against  U.S.,  allied  and  friendly  forces.    This  directive  implements  DoD  CWMD  concepts,  strategy,  doctrine  and  policy  across  the  Air  Force.    The  Air  Force,  in  conjunction  with  the other Services, other agencies, and elements of U.S. national power, must have the offensive and  defensive  capabilities  required  to  counter  WMD  in  order  to  dissuade,  deter  and  defeat those who seek to harm the United States, its citizens, its Armed Forces, and its friends and allies  through  WMD  use  or  threat  of  use,  while  maintaining  the  ability  to  respond  to  and mitigate the effects of WMD use, and to restore deterrence. 1.2.  This  directive  outlines  authorities  and  responsibilities  for  implementing  DoD  CWMD strategy,  doctrine  and  policy  across  the  Air  Force.    It  outlines  Air  Force  roles  and responsibilities  in  support  of  the  multi-tiered  Service,  Joint  and  combined  capability  to counter WMD as defined in the DoD Strategy for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction, and as further delineated in DoDD 2060.02 and JP 340.  As outlined in those documents, Air Force forces must contribute to the capabilities required to defeat and deter the employment and  subsequent  use  of  WMD.    In  addition,  Air  Force  forces  must  be  prepared  to  protect against,  respond  to  and  recover  from  WMD  use  across  the  range  of  military  operations.  Furthermore,  Air  Force  forces,  in  concert  with  the  other  elements  of  U.S.  national  power, must defend against, dissuade and deny WMD proliferation or possession.  Finally, Air Force forces must contribute as appropriate to national efforts to reduce, destroy or reverse WMD possession by adversaries. 1.3.  This  directive  establishes  the  Air  Force  Countering  Weapons  of  Mass  Destruction Enterprise.    It  designates  the  AF/A10  as  the  Assistant  Chief  of  Staff  (ACS)  with responsibility for overseeing and managing the CWMD Enterprise.  The Air Force CWMD AFPD10-26  17 JUNE 2015   3  Enterprise  shall  be  led  by  a  senior-level  (e.g.,  general  officer/senior  executive  service) “council” responsible for managing and overseeing the activities of the Enterprise, as well as the supporting structures, plans, processes and procedures required to effectively manage Air Force CWMD activities. 1.4.  This  directive  also  outlines  policy  to  ensure  the  Air  Force  safeguards  BSAT  in  the manner prescribed by DoD guidance, assigns authorities and responsibilities for safeguarding BSAT and establishes the requirement for a BPRP. 1.5.  Finally, this directive outlines Air Force policy for ensuring the survivability of CBRN mission critical systems in a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear environment, and it assigns  authorities  and  responsibilities  for  implementing  DoD  guidance  regarding  CBRN survivability for CBRN mission critical systems. 2.

Level  2—  Practices,  safety  equipment  and  facility  design  and  construction  are  applicable  to clinical,  diagnostic,  teaching  and  other  laboratories  in  which  work  is  done  with  the  broad spectrum  of  indigenous  moderate-risk  agents  that  are  present  in  the  community  and  associated with human disease of varying severity. Level  3—  Practices,  safety  equipment  and  facility  design  and  construction  are  applicable  to clinical,  diagnostic,  teaching,  research  or  production  facilities  in  which  work  is  done  with indigenous or  exotic agents  with  a potential for respiratory transmission,  and which may  cause serious and potential lethal infection. Level  4—  Works  with  bio  materials  that  have  been  determined  by  the  CDC  to  represent  the greatest  hazards  to  human  health  for  which  there  are  no  treatments  (i.e.,  smallpox  and hemorrhagic fevers). Biological  Surety  Program—A  system  of  control  measures  designed  to  provide  protection  to the  local  population,  workers  and  the  environment  by  ensuring  that  BSAT  operations  are conducted safely; that BSAT are secure; and that personnel involved in those operations meet the highest standards of reliability. (AR 50-1) Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological  and  Nuclear  Consequence  Management—Actions taken to  plan,  prepare,  respond  to,  and  recover  from  chemical,  biological,  radiological  and  nuclear incidents.

Also called CBRN environment. (JP 3-11) Controlled Area—An area to which entry is subject to special restrictions or control for security reasons, or to safeguard property or material.  This does not necessarily include those designated areas restricting or prohibiting overflight by aircraft.  Controlled areas may be of different types depending on the nature and varying degree of importance of the security interest, or other matter contained  therein.    NOTE:  For  the  purposes  of  the  Air  Force  Biosurety  Program,  the  term   14  AFPD10-26  17 JUNE 2015 “controlled  area”  meets  the  standards  of  what  Office  of  the  Undersecretary  of  Defense  for Intelligence guidance refers to as a “restricted area.” (JP 3-04) Countering  Weapons  of  Mass  Destruction—Efforts  against  actors  of  concern  to  curtail  the conceptualization,  development,  possession,  proliferation,  use,  and  effects  of  weapons  of  mass destruction,  related  expertise,  materials,  technologies  and  means  of  delivery.
