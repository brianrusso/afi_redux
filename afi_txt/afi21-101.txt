JOHN B. COOPER Lieutenant General, USAF DCS/Logistics, Engineering & Force Protection Attachment: Guidance Changes            2 AFGM2017-01 Revision to AFI 21-101 Attachment Guidance Changes (ADD) 1.19. Maintenance Cyber Discipline (ADD) 1.19.1. For the purpose of this AFI, Electronic Tools (eTools) are portable electronic devices (e.g. laptop computer, hand held device) that operate in a disconnected mode and/or, are certified to inter-operate on Air Force (AF) networks, are mission critical because they are the primary method for viewing electronic technical publications, and in some cases are used to exchange maintenance data with approved Maintenance Information Systems (MIS) at the point of maintenance.  Note: eTools do not include electronic devices and test equipment issued and configuration managed by a system Program Manager (PM).  Improper procurement, sustainment, and use of eTools poses a significant cyber risk to AF systems.  Protocols have been identified as a critical element in mitigating emerging cyber threats.  The guidance below establishes requirements for developing and implementing daily/periodic cyber mitigation processes.  The intent is to reduce cyber risk and assigns responsibilities that provide the best possible opportunity for success for achieving mission assurance in cyber threat environments. (ADD) 1.19.2.  Variations in eTools functionality across AF weapon systems must be approved by the applicable system Program Manager (PM) IAW AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management.  This is done to ensure the program’s product support strategy identifies and supports interrelationships and integration with programs and processes both inside and outside the program’s current Program Executive Officer (PEO) portfolio.  Additionally, this ensures the program’s product support strategy aligns to Air Force enterprise priorities. (ADD) 1.19.3.  MAJCOMs/ANG will develop and implement guidance that ensures eTools standardization, management, and configuration control IAW 17 series publications.  eTools are procured IAW AFI 63-138, Acquisition of Services, and sustained IAW AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management.

Introduction.  This  instruction  prescribes  basic  aircraft  and  equipment  maintenance management  policy  implementation  and  procedures  used  throughout  the  USAF  to  perform Mission Generation (MG) functions. 1.2.  Organization.  AF  organizations  are  structured    according  to  AFI  38-101,  Air  Force Organization, or as authorized by AF/A1M.  Contracted maintenance functions are not required to organize IAW AFI 38-101, but will implement the organization as outlined in their proposal as accepted  by  the  government.    The  term  “Lead  Command”  is  used  to  describe  the  technical advocacy  and  product  support  provided  to  individual  weapon  systems  across  the  using MAJCOMs  as  described  in  AFPD  10-9,  Lead  Command  Designation  and  Responsibilities  for Weapon Systems. 1.3.  Maintenance  Concept.  Per  AFPD  21-1,  organizational, intermediate  and  depot maintenance  capabilities  for  operational  readiness  shall  be  maintained  to  ensure  effective  and timely response to peacetime operations, mobilizations, national defense contingencies and other emergencies. 1.3.1.  As a minimum each capability will be able to: 1.3.1.1.  Organizational:  launch  and  recover  sorties,  maintain  and  repair  material  coded for organizational level repair. 1.3.1.2.  Intermediate:  repair  materiel  coded  for  organizational  and  intermediate  level repair in back shops and/or centralized repair facilities. 1.3.1.3.  Depot:  repair  materiel  coded  for  organizational,  intermediate  and  depot; overhaul; rebuild; modify and manufacture. 1.3.2.  Organizational  and  intermediate-level  maintenance  is  organized  into  two  mutally supporting networks, the Mission Generation Network (MGN) and the Repair Network (RN). The  MGN  is  optimized for  mission  generation  at  the  wing  level  and  consists  of  authorized “on-equipment”  and  “off-equipment”  maintenance  capabilities  required  to  launch,  recover, configure,  inspect  and  repair  AF  systems  and  equipment.    The  RN  supports  the  MGN  by providing  maintenance  required  to  fulfill  operational  needs  outside  the  capability  and/or capacity  of MGN activities.  The interface between the two networks takes place when the MGN activity relinquishes control of reparable assets to the RN activity (e.g. supply counter turn-in)  or  changing  an  end  item  possession  code  from  an  operational  activity  to  a  repair network activity (e.g. depot maintenance).1.3.1.  Most MGN units possess a complement of equipment and supplies to perform on-equipment and off-equipment maintenance. 1.3.2.1.  RN units may reside at bases that perform mission generation.  RN requirements and processes are identified in AFI 20-117, Repair Network Integration (RNI) and when published, AFMAN 20-118, Repair Network Integration (RNI) Operations. 1.3.3.  Requests  for  Assistance  (RFA).  If  a  maintenance  activity  requires  assistance  for evaluation  and/or  repair  beyond  unit  capability,  requests  are  made  IAW  AFI  21-103, Equipment  Inventory,  Status  And  Utilization  Reporting;  TO  00-25-107,  Maintenance AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   11  Assistance; and TO 00-20-14, AF Metrology and Calibration Program, or automated process as  approved  by  the  Mission  Design  Series  (MDS)  Program  Manager  (PM)  (e.g.,  C-130 AIRCATS,  F-16  TAR).  All  requests  for  assistance  must  be  coordinated  through  the originating MAJCOM and Lead Command as applicable.  (T-2). 1.4.  Aircraft Maintenance Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP).  TTPs are developed from  lessons  learned  and  best  practices  that  provide  valuable  reference  documents  to  improve maintenance  processes  and  procedures.    Maintenance  leaders  should  utilize  the  maintenance fundamentals  TTP  volumes  (Aircraft,  Munitions/Missile)  to  effectively  and  efficiently  support mission  generation.    Maintainers  who  attend  the  USAF  Advanced  Maintenance  and  Munitions Operations  School  (AMMOS)  are  trained  in  advanced  operational,  expeditionary  and  tactical maintenance management concepts stemming from the alumni’s development and formalization of TTPs.  MXG/CC’s should identify their AMMOS graduates and utilize them as advisors and instructors  to  enhance  mission  capability.    TTP  3-3,  Aircraft  Maintenance,  can  be  found  at: https://intelshare.intelink.gov/sites/561jts/3-3/default.aspx.    For  additional  information  on AMMOS  and  TTP  development  see  AFI  21-111,  Advanced  Maintenance  and  Munitions Education Program. 1.5.  Aircraft and Equipment Readiness.  Aircraft and equipment readiness is the maintenance mission.    The  maintenance  function  ensures  assigned  aircraft  and  equipment  are  safe, serviceable,  and  properly  configured  to  meet  mission  needs.    Maintenance  actions  include,  but are  not  limited  to,  inspection,  repair,  overhaul,  modification,  preservation,  refurbishment, troubleshooting, testing,  analyzing condition  and performance and maintenance documentation.  All  levels  of  supervision  need  to  place  emphasis  on  safety,  quality,  and  timeliness  in  the performance  of  maintenance.    The  concept  of  quality  maintenance  must  be  fostered  by  each supervisor and technician to ensure the integrity and skill of each maintainer is not degraded.  To the  greatest  extent  possible,  maintenance  is  accomplished  on  a  preplanned  scheduled  basis.  Planning  provides  the  most  effective  and  efficient  use  of  people,  facilities,  and  equipment, reduces  unscheduled  maintenance,  and  allows  for  progressive  actions  toward  maintaining  and returning  aircraft  and  equipment  to  safe  operating  condition.    Exploiting  repair  network capability and maintaining visibility of repair cycle assets throughout the maintenance cycle are also critical elements of the equipment maintenance program. 1.5.1.  Preventive  Maintenance.    AF  units  implement  and  manage  the  tasks  specified  in  the scheduled  recurring  maintenance  program  for  their  assigned  aircraft  and  associated  support equipment  (SE).    Preventive  maintenance  is  achieved  through  the  inspection  requirement in  TO  00-20-1,  Aerospace  Equipment  Maintenance  Inspection, concepts  described Documentation, Policy, and Procedures, and applicable weapon system -6 TO. 1.6.  Maintenance  Discipline.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  all  maintenance  personnel  to  comply with  all  written  guidance  to  ensure  required  repairs,  inspections,  and  documentation  are completed  in  a  compliant,  safe,  timely,  and  effective  manner.    Supervisors  are  responsible  for enforcing and establishing a climate that promotes maintenance and supply discipline. 1.6.1.  Compliance  Terminology.  For  the  purposes  of  this  instruction,  the  following definitions apply: 1.6.1.1.  Shall,  Must,  Will  -  Indicates  mandatory  requirements.    Note:  “Will”  is  also used to express a declaration of purpose for a future event.   12  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 1.6.1.2.  Should - Indicates a preferred method of accomplishment. 1.6.1.3.  May - Indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.6.2.  Use  of  Technical  Orders  (TO)  and  TO  Supplements. Use  of  the  prescribed  technical data  to  maintain  aircraft  and  equipment  is  mandatory  and  will  be  conducted  and  managed IAW  TO  00-5-1,  Air  Force  Technical  Order  System.    (T-1).    All  personnel  will  enforce compliance with technical data.  (T-1). 1.7.  Communications  Security (CCI) Accountability.  The Air Force COMSEC/Central  CCI Authority is  the Cryptologic and Cyber Systems Division, Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas. (COMSEC)/Controlled  Cryptographic Item IAW  AFMAN  33-283, 1.7.1.  COMSEC/CCI  accountability  will  be  accomplished Communications  Security  (COMSEC)  Operations  and  AFI  23-101,  Air  Force  Materiel Management. (T-1).  Questions concerning COMSEC/CCI accountability can be directed to the Cryptologic and Cyber Systems Division’s COMSEC Policy Office (AFLCMC/HNCLS) at DSN 969-3886. 1.8.  Environmental  Compliance.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  all  maintenance  personnel  to comply with all written guidance to ensure compliance with hazardous material, hazardous waste management  and  air  emissions  record  keeping  as  required  for  environmental  compliance  IAW AFI  90-  803,  Environmental,  Safety,  and  Occupational  Health  Compliance  Assessment  and Management  Program, applicable environmental requirements and guidance.  (T-0). installation  ESOHMS/EMS  policy/guidance and 1.9.  Publications.  Units may tailor procedures to the unique aspects of their own maintenance operation and publish directives, instructions, supplements, addendums, and, for functional areas, Operating Instructions (OI) IAW AFI 33-360. 1.9.1.  Develop,  control,  and  maintain  functional  checklists,  at  a  minimum,  each  functional checklist  is  titled  and  dated.    Functional  checklists  are  not  be  used  in  place  of  or  to circumvent  technical  data  for  operation,  servicing,  inspection  or  maintenance  of  aircraft, aircraft  systems,  munitions,  and  all  other  equipment  supporting  aircraft  and  munitions maintenance. 1.10.  Maintenance  Training.  Maintenance  training  provides  initial,  recurring  and  advanced proficiency, qualification, or certification skills needed by a technician to perform duties in their primary AF Specialty Code (AFSC)/Civilian Job Series.  Maintenance training includes combat and  sortie  generation  skills  not  normally  integrated  into  peacetime  operations  (e.g.,  munitions handling, and external fuel tank build-up, hot refueling).  Maintenance training carries an equal priority  with  the  operational  training  mission.    For  maintenance  training  policy  and  guidance, refer to AFI 36-2650, Maintenance Training and MAJCOM supplements. 1.11.  Modification Management.  A modification proposal is a recommendation to change the operation, use, or appearance of AF equipment.  Modifications (temporary, permanent, or safety) to AF aircraft or equipment are expressly prohibited without PM approval. Note:  PM is used in this publication as defined in DODD 5000.01.  Refer to AFI 63-131, Modification Management, for modification management procedures. 1.11.1.  Modifications to Munitions.  All proposed modifications to aircraft-carried munitions include  SEEK  EAGLE  certification  IAW  AFI  63-104,  The  SEEK  EAGLE  Program.    All AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   13  modifications  to  AF  nuclear  munitions  or  their  associated  support/training  equipment  are nuclear certified IAW AFI 91-103, Air Force Nuclear Safety Design Certification Program and  AFI  63-125,  Nuclear  Certification  Program.    All  modifications  to  AF  conventional munitions or their associated support/training equipment are certified IAW AFI 91-205, Non-Nuclear Munitions Safety Board. 1.12.  Maintenance  Information  Systems  (MIS).  MIS  refers  to  automated  maintenance information  systems  that  support  and  enable  maintenance  business  processes.    MIS  is  used  to document maintenance actions and track  fleet  health.  The information  entered into the MIS is  accomplished IAW TO 00-20-2, Maintenance Data Documentation  and match the content of the aircraft  forms.    MIS  data  entries  do  not  have  to  be  accomplished  by  the  same  individual  who documented  the  aircraft  forms,  but  employee  numbers/man  numbers/USERIDs  of  individuals accomplishing the actual work are entered into the MIS.  Red Ball maintenance is documented IAW Chapter 11 of this instruction. 1.12.1.  Units use the approved MIS for their assigned weapon system. 1.13.  General  Safety  Guidance.  Maintenance  personnel  are  exposed  to  a  large  variety  of hazardous  situations,  machinery,  equipment,  and  chemicals.    Most  hazardous  situations  can  be avoided  by  following  approved  procedures,  asking  for  help  when  needed,  and  using  personal protective equipment (PPE). 1.13.1.  Safety  “Knock  It  Off”  and  Risk  Management.    Due  to  the  inherent  danger  to  life, limb,  and  property  associated  with  maintenance  operations,  personnel  are  empowered  to terminate  an  operation  or  situation  which  they  perceive  is  unsafe  or  too  dangerous.    When supervisors/crew leaders become task-focused, junior personnel are often better able to assess the danger; however, deferring to the experience and judgment of the crew leader, they may choose  to  remain  silent,  missing  an  opportunity  to  break  the  mishap  sequence  chain.  Maintenance commanders and supervisors are responsible to foster a culture in their units so that a simple, but recognizable “audible” from anyone can prevent a potential mishap.  Note: See AFI 90-802, Risk Management, and AFPAM 90-803, Risk Management (RM) Guidelines and Tools for additional information. 1.13.2.  Visitors.  Units will not permit visitors to operate any AF equipment unless they are qualified  to  operate  such  equipment  and  are  doing  so  in  the  performance  of  their  assigned official  duties.    (T-1).  Visitors  will  not  be  allowed  in  the  flightline  area  if  munitions operations are present IAW AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards.  (T-1). 1.14.  Duty Shifts and Rest Periods.  Maintenance personnel duty hours are aligned to provide optimal mission support. 1.14.1.  Supervision at all levels will be equitably distributed to cover all duty periods.  (T-2). 1.14.2.  Personnel will not be scheduled for more than 12 hours of continuous duty time.  (T-1).  Duty time begins when personnel report for duty and ends when their supervisor releases them.  Time spent in exercise/contingency deployment processing lines and in-transit counts toward the total duty day.  Exception: MXG/CCs are final approval authority for duty time extensions exceeding 12-hour limit up to a maximum of 16 hours.  Aircraft/Detachment CCs assume this responsibility in deployed/travel status.   14  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 1.14.3.  Commanders and supervisors will provide a rest period after each shift.  (T-1). A rest period  is  a  block  of  time  that  gives  a  person  the  opportunity  for  8  hours  of  uninterrupted sleep in a 24-hour period.  Note: This rest period also applies during exercises or inspections. 1.14.4.  Personnel  will  not  handle,  load  or  perform  maintenance  on  nuclear  weapons, conventional  munitions  and/or  egress  explosives  beyond  a  12-hour  continuous  duty  period.  (T-1).    This  requirement  may  not  be  waived  for  exercises  or  inspections;  however,  the  12-hour continuous duty period may be exceeded for shift turnover/administrative actions only and will be avoided to the maximum extent possible. The MXG/CC or equivalent may waive this requirement during advance defense readiness conditions, actual emergencies as defined in  DOD  Directive  3150.02,  DOD  Nuclear  Weapons  Surety  Program,  or  to  resolve  an unexpected event (e.g. disabled vehicle, WS3 fault, hoist failure, etc…). 1.14.5.  In  alert  force  or  standby  duty  situations  where  facilities  are  available  for  resting, established norms may be exceeded.  Adjust rest periods to allow for 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. 1.14.6.  Commanders and supervisors will ensure individuals are afforded adequate duty rest periods and breaks to prevent fatigue or thermal injury.   (T-1).  Stop anyone if fatigue may jeopardize  safety.  In  all  cases,  Aircraft  Commanders  (AC)/supervisors  ensure  aircraft maintenance personnel are not required to perform duty when they have reached the point of physical  or  mental  fatigue  rendering  them  incapable  of  performing  their  assigned  duties safely and reliably. 1.15.  Communications.  Effective  maintenance  accomplishment  requires to efficiently  and  effectively  communicate  across  all  facets  of  the  maintenance  operation. Communication  technology  (radios,  cell  phones,  wireless  internet,  etc.)  must  be  available  to expedite  personnel,  equipment,  material,  and  maintenance  data  throughout  the  maintenance complex.    (T-2).    Commanders  shall  develop  communication  plans  according  to  mission requirements.  (T-2).  See Chapter 11 for detailed communication requirements. the  ability 1.15.1.  MAJCOMs will develop guidance on the use and control of personal electronic and communication devices on the flightline, in munitions areas, hangars, and/or other industrial work areas. 1.16.  Maintenance  Repair  Priorities.  Maintenance  repair  priorities  are  listed  in  Table  1.1  This  does  not  prohibit  the  Production  Superintendent  (Pro  Super),  in  coordination  with  the Maintenance  Operations  Center  (MOC),  from  changing  the  maintenance  repair  priority  when warranted.    During  tasked  Operational  Plan  (OPLAN)  or  operational  exercise,  the  preplanned maintenance  flow  determines  job  sequence.    The  maintenance  repair  priority  and  the  Logistics Readiness  Squadron  (LRS)  delivery  priorities  (listed  in  AFI  23-123V1,  Materiel  Management Reference Information) are normally identical.  Raising or lowering maintenance repair priorities does not necessarily require a corresponding change in the LRS delivery priority.  However, the Pro Super may authorize the use of a less responsive LRS delivery priority. AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 Table 1.1.  Maintenance Repair Priority Designators.

(T-1). 2.7.  Wing Weapons  Manager  (WWM).  The WWM is the wing's focal point for all weapons loading  and  armament  systems  related  matters.    The  WWM's  primary  efforts  focus  on compliance,  continuity,  and  standardization.    The  WWM  will  be  a  2W100  CMSgt  assigned directly  to  the  MXG/CC.    (T-1).    In  units  where  2W1  personnel  are  assigned  but  no  2W100 authorization  exists,  the  MXG/CC  will  appoint  the  most  qualified  2W1  to  fulfill  WWM AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   25  responsibilities outlined in  this chapter   (T-1).    Note:   For ARC, the Senior Weapons  Loading Supervisor serves as the WWM and does not require assignment to the MXG/CC staff.  Weapons activities  required  to  support  the  generation  of  peacetime  training  sorties  generally  do  not reinforce primary combat skills.  Therefore, the WWM plays a key role in ensuring that the unit is  able to  produce combat loaded aircraft.  The WWM is  charged with  providing technical  and managerial advice to senior leaders in matters of weapons loading and armament systems.  The WWM coordinates with the Weapons Sections, Armament Flight, Wing Safety, Wing Weapons and Tactics Officer, the Munitions Squadron/Flight, and other unit agencies on weapons related matters.  The WWM is a certifying official and evaluator for weapons loading task certifications and qualifications.  The WWM is the functional manager for all 2W1X1 personnel.  WWM will coordinate on support agreements and provide support for geographically separated units.  (T-1).  Exception:    Unless  outlined  under  additional  TFI  guidance.    The  WWM  is  the  wing  Point  of Contact  (POC)  for  all  2W1XX  manpower  issues  to  include  coordination  on  all  manning  (e.g. AFSC,  grade,  and  skill-level)  changes,  work  center  and  organizational  changes.    The  WWM will: 2.7.1.  Review  and  coordinate  on  the  Unit  Manning  Document(s)  (UMD).    (T-1).    The WWM  will  ensure  assignment  of  position  numbers  to  new  arrivals,  and  existing  2W1 personnel  are  properly  assigned  on  the  UMD  to  balance  2W1XX  grades,  experience  and skill-levels  between  all  2W1XX  work  centers  across  the  wing.    (T-1).    The  WWM  will coordinate on all 2W1 personnel position change requests.  (T-1). 2.7.2.  Ensure sufficient  quantities  of serviceable  load crew training munitions are available to support both load crew and Dual Loading Operations (DLO) training programs.  (T-1). 2.7.3.  Ensure  all  wing  2W1X1  personnel  regardless  of  duty  position  receive  initial  and recurring  weapons  academics.    (T-1).    The  WWM  will  ensure  introductory  training  is provided  to  newly  assigned  personnel  on  aircraft  familiarization,  safe  for  maintenance, explosive  safety,  weapons  release  and  gun  system  safety  prior  to  performing  duties  (as applicable to work center).  (T-1). 2.7.4.  Designate  the  Weapons  Standardization  (WS)  SUPT,  Loading  Standardization  Crew (LSC), lead  crews as WS certifying officials and the primary  weapons  academic instructor.  (T-1).  The WWM may designate the weapons section Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC)  to  perform  WS  functions  of  academics  and  weapons  task  qualification  in  HH-60 units. 2.7.5.  Determine the number of load crews (based on unit taskings), other than the LSC and lead  crews,  to  be  certified  on  support  or  limited  use  munitions.    (T-1).    In  nuclear-tasked units,  the  WWM  will  determine  the  number  of  load  crews  required  to  be  certified  on applicable  nuclear  weapons  in  support  of  OPLANs  when  the  OPLAN’s  Designed Operational  Capability  (DOC)  statement  does  not  dictate  load  crew  requirements.    (T-1).  Note: The WWM coordinates with the MXG/CC in determining the number of load crews to be certified on support or limited use munitions. 2.7.6.  Use the Weapons Load Crew Management Tool (WLCMT) or MAJCOM-equivalent automated database to track load crew certification and qualification status.  (T-1). 2.7.7.  Monitor overall load crew status  and advise the MXG/CC when the number of  fully certified load crews fall below the Unit Committed Munitions List (UCML) or Test/Training   26  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 Munitions  List    (TTML)  minimum  requirements.    (T-2).    If  this  occurs  and  cannot  be corrected within 30 days, a secure message will be sent  via Secret  Internet  Protocol  Router (SIPR),  through  the  MXG/CC,  to  the  appropriate  MAJCOM  2W1XX  functional  manager.  (T-1).    Note:  All 2W1X1s working outside their respective work center or Duty Air Force Specialty  Code  (DAFSC)  will  be  qualified/certified  if  possible  to  fill  load  crew  shortfalls before sending a message to the MAJCOM.  (T-2).  The MAJCOM will send the message via SIPR  to  AF/A4LW  at  usaf.pentagon.af-a4.mbx.a4lw-workflow@mail.mil.    The  message will include: 2.7.7.1.  Number of 2W1X1 personnel authorized and assigned by work center, skill level (primary AFSC) and grade for the entire wing. Include all work centers to which 2W1X1 personnel are assigned. 2.7.7.2.  Number of 2W1X1 personnel working outside the AFSC/work center. 2.7.7.3.  Number of 2W1X1s not able to perform primary duties and the reason. 2.7.7.4.  Number  of  fully  certified  crews.    Include  corrective  action,  get  well  date,  and 30/60-day  load  crew  status  projection.    If  the  standard  cannot  be  reached  in  60  days, provide the reason. 2.7.7.5.  Number  of  load  crews  formed  but  not  fully  certified.      List  crews  and  specific items for which they are not certified and qualified. 2.7.7.6.

Ensure  a  recognition  program  for  weapons  and  armament  personnel  is  established.  (T-2). 2.7.12.  Ensure standardization of load crew Composite Tool Kit (CTK) by aircraft MDS to the maximum extent possible to provide interoperability of load crews; and, in coordination AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   27  with the Weapons Section NCOIC and WS Superintendent, determine the number of CTKs required.  (T-2). 2.7.12.1.  Load crew CTK contents will be approved by the WWM.  (T-2). 2.7.13.  In coordination with Wing Safety, Airfield Operations Flight, and Quality Assurance, develop  an  installation  publication  or  supplement  to  this  AFI  for  parking,  launch  and recovery  of  explosives-loaded  aircraft,  end-of-runway  procedures,  and  to  outline  situations warranting  impoundment  of  aircraft  with  hung  ordnance,  delayed  release  or  jammed  gun systems.  (T-1). 2.7.14.  The WWM will ensure  arm/de-arm of munitions  loaded aircraft is accomplished in approved  areas.    (T-1).    Immediately-prior-to-launch  and  "safing"  procedures  may  be performed  in  the  aircraft  parking  area  for  contingencies,  unit  exercises,  and  daily  training missions  as  quantity  distance  clearance  allows  with  the  approval  of  Wing  Safety,  Airfield Operations Flight, and the MXG/CC. 2.7.15.  Establish  procedures  for  inspecting  and  "safing"  hung  munitions  or  external  stores before  aircraft return to  parking  areas;  and controlling access  to  aircraft  until  munitions  are made safe and cause of hung stores is identified.  (T-1).  Aircraft guns and rockets are to be "safed" in the de-arm area before aircraft return to open ramp parking areas. 2.7.16.  Inform  the  MAJCOM,  within  24  hours,  of  any  significant  weapons  or  armament related  issues  such  as  dropped/hung  munitions,  equipment  and  aircraft  release  reliability  or deficiency  problems,  and  weapons  safety  or  mishap  issues.    (T-2).    Note:    Units  follow MAJCOM and local reporting instructions. 2.7.16.1.  If  a  unit  has  an  incident,  it  is  important  to  preserve  the  evidence  to  the maximum extent allowable by operational  requirements and safety.  An example would be segregating an aircraft gun versus destroying it if it poses no immediate danger.  This allows for evaluation of all the evidence and the ability to recreate the mishap conditions. 2.7.17.  Monitor  weapons  release/gun  fire-out  rates,  malfunctions  and  corrective  actions  to assess weapons and armament systems reliability.  (T-1). 2.7.17.1.  Weapons  release  reliability  rates  are  calculated  by  dividing  the  number  of successful releases by the number of attempts (Goal: 99%). 2.7.17.2.  The gun fire-out rate is calculated by dividing the number of successful bursts by the number attempted (Goal: 98%).  Once a malfunction occurs, any further attempts for the purpose of clearing the malfunction should not be counted as attempts. 2.7.18.  Ensure compliance with local accountability procedures IAW AFI 11-212, Munitions Requirements  for  Aircrew  Training,  and  AFI  21-201.    (T-1).    In  conjunction  with  the Weapons  Section(s)  and  Munitions  Flight,  the  WWM  will  develop  a  standard  local  format for  the  AF  Form  2434,  Munitions  Configuration  and  Expenditure  Document.    (T-2).    A computer-generated product may be used if it contains all required information. 2.7.19.  Coordinate  with  Maintenance  Supervision,  Munitions  Squadron/Flight,  OSS’s Operations  Plans,  and  Wing  Safety  in  developing  nuclear  weapons  operations  procedures (e.g., convoy, custody transfer, no-lone-zone), if applicable.

High priority TCTOs or other circumstances may result in more workload than can be accommodated.  In the event the section cannot accomplish the special workload as well as normal CND/BCS screening, the following formula may be used to identify those LRUs that could  be  temporarily  “direct  Not  Repairable  This  Station  (NRTS)”  without  screening.  The formula  may  also  help  determine  LRU  priorities  in  order  to  adjust  workload  to  meet production. Index formula: Index Number = Percent of Base Repair (PBR) * EXCHG PRICE * Daily Demand Rate (DDR). 4.7.2.1.  LRUs with higher index numbers have a higher priority for repair compared to those  with  lower  numbers.  In  the  example  below,  the  Programmable  Signal  Processor (PSP)  would  have  the  highest  priority,  followed  by  Dual  Mode  Transmitter  (DMT). Digital  Flight  Control  Computer  (DFLCC)  may  be  a  candidate  to  temporarily  “Direct NRTS” until workload permits CND/BCS screening. Figure 4.1.  Example Index Numbers.

(T-1). AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   103  6.7.4.4.  A minor finding is defined as an unsatisfactory condition that requires repair or correction, but does not endanger personnel, impact safety of flight, jeopardize equipment reliability or warrant discontinuing a process or equipment operation. 6.7.4.4.1.  CAT  II  minors  shall  be  documented  for  trends,  but  must  not  be  counted against the AQL.  (T-1). 6.7.4.4.2.  FO contained in tool kits or found in cargo areas of aircraft which pose no FOD  threat  are  classified  as  a  minor  finding  since  it  would  require  more  than  one additional action to meet the definition of a major finding. 6.7.5.  Observations.    This  category  represents  observed  events  or  conditions  with  safety implications or technical violations not related to an evaluation or inspection, are considered unsafe,  in  violation  of  established  procedures,  or  in  the  case  of  equipment,  unfit  for operations.  Observations  include: DSVs,  TDVs  and  UCRs.  The  MAJCOM-approved  QA database is used to document any of the following conditions: 6.7.5.1.  DSV.  An observed unsafe act by an individual. 6.7.5.1.1.  The QA Inspector must stop the unsafe act immediately.  (T-1). 6.7.5.1.2.  The  QA  Inspector  will  not  document  a  separate  DSV  on  an  individual undergoing  a  PE  since  the  unsafe  act  automatically  results  in  a  "Fail"  rating  on  the PE.  (T-1). 6.7.5.1.2.1.  The QA Inspector will use DSV verbiage in the PE summary when a safety violation is committed during a PE.  (T-1). 6.7.5.2.  TDV.  An observation of any person performing maintenance without the proper technical data available, available but not in use or not following the correct sequence of steps (if directed). 6.7.5.2.1.  The  technician  must  have  knowledge  of  all  general  directives  associated with the job prior to performing the task.   (T-1).  However, those general directives need not be present at the job site. 6.7.5.2.2.  Do  not  document  a  separate  TDV  on  an  individual  undergoing  a  PE,  but use TDV verbiage in the PE summary since failure to use technical data automatically results in a "Fail" rating. 6.7.5.3.  UCR.    An  unsafe  or  unsatisfactory  condition,  other  than  a  DSV,  chargeable  to the work center supervisor. 6.7.5.3.1.  UCRs will be documented even when  it is  not  possible to  determine who created the condition.  (T-1). 6.7.6.  Evaluations.    An  evaluation  represents  the  direct  evaluation  of  a  logistics  action, inspection, or training conducted/performed by an individual or team.  Evaluations are used to  evaluate  job  proficiency,  degree  of  training,  and  compliance  with  technical  data  or instructions. 6.7.6.1.  Personnel Evaluations (PE).  A PE is an over-the-shoulder (direct) evaluation of a  maintenance  action  or  inspection.    Individuals  performing,  supervising  or  evaluating   104  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 maintenance  tasks  are  subject  to  a  PE.    PEs  may  be  performed  on  individuals  working alone or as part of a team. 6.7.6.1.1.  Rate PEs “Pass or Fail” based on established AQLs/standards.  (T-1). 6.7.6.1.2.  Document the PE in the MAJCOM-approved database.  (T-1). 6.7.6.1.3.  PEs  will  be  accomplished  on  all  technicians  who  perform  maintenance based on the MAJCOM-established frequency.  (T-1). 6.7.6.1.4.  Personnel  in  any  AFSC  certified  to  perform  nuclear  maintenance  or logistics  operations  (e.g.,  limited  general  maintenance,  transfer,  transport,  etc.),  will also comply with applicable PE requirements in AFI 21-200.  (T-1). 6.7.6.1.5.  Types of PEs. 6.7.6.1.5.1.  Individual  Evaluations.    This  is  a  QA  over-the-shoulder  (direct) evaluation of a technician or supervisor performing a job. 6.7.6.1.5.2.  Team  Evaluations. evaluation of technicians and supervisors performing a team task.   This  is  a  QA  over-the-shoulder  (direct) 6.7.6.1.5.2.1.  A team task is one requiring more than one person to complete the task (e.g., refueling,  ECM pod up/down loading, bomb  build-up, towing, weapons maintenance, pylon installation). 6.7.6.1.5.2.2.  Team  evaluations  must  accurately  assess  the  proficiency  of each individual under evaluation.  (T-1). 6.7.6.1.5.2.3.  Refer  to  AFI  21-200  for  nuclear  weapons  maintenance  and handling evaluations. 6.7.6.1.6.  QA  Inspectors  will  conduct  PE’s  on  each  NDI  technician,  for  each  NDI method  annually  (every  2  years  for  the  ARC)  to  ensure  effective  trending  on  NDI methods.  (T-1). 6.7.6.2.  Performing  a  PE.  When  performing  a  PE,  the  QA  Inspector  will  brief  the individual or team on the evaluation and how it will be rated.  (T-1). 6.7.6.2.1.  The QA inspector will determine what task will be evaluated.  (T-1). 6.7.6.2.2.  The  PE  will  include  an  evaluation  of:  the  individual’s  training  records, SCR (if task requires), tool box, TMDE, and TOs used to perform the task.  (T-1). 6.7.6.2.3.  The  evaluation  starts  when  the  individual  or  team  begins  the  task,  or portion  of  the  task  to  be  evaluated,  and  is  completed  when  the  task  or  previously determined portion of the task is finished.  (T-1). 6.7.6.2.4.  Provide  feedback  to  the  individual  or  team  and  supervision  upon completion.  (T-1). 6.7.6.3.  Rating PEs.  QA Inspectors rate each evaluation based on AQLs/standards.  The rating applies only to the specific task evaluated and not to other tasks that a technician or supervisor  is  qualified  to  perform.    Upon  completion  of  a  failed  evaluation,  the  QA Inspector must provide on-the-spot feedback.  (T-1).  Determine ratings as follows: 6.7.6.3.1.  Pass: Number of discrepancies does not exceed AQL/standards. AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   105  6.7.6.3.2.  Fail: An evaluation that results in any of the following: 6.7.6.3.2.1.  Number of discrepancies exceeds the established AQL/standards. 6.7.6.3.2.2.  A  technician  fails  to  detect  a  major  discrepancy  while  complying with an inspection or TO requirement. 6.7.6.3.2.3.  A  technician  fails  to  comply  with  a  technical  data  step  that  could affect the performance of the equipment involved or cause injury to personnel. 6.7.6.3.2.3.1.  QA Inspectors will notify indivduals immediately during the PE that a TDV was committed.  (T-1). 6.7.6.3.2.3.2.  Do not document a separate TDV on an individual undergoing a PE, since failure to use technical data automatically results in a “Fail” rating. 6.7.6.3.2.4.  A  technician  demonstrates  a  lack  of  technical  proficiency,  system knowledge or demonstrated knowledge commensurate with skill grade. 6.7.6.3.2.5.  Training/certification not documented. 6.7.6.3.2.6.  A technician commits a safety violation. 6.7.6.3.2.6.1.  Use  the  word  “Safety”  when  a  safety  violation  is  committed during a PE. 6.7.6.3.2.6.2.  Do not document a separate DSV on an individual undergoing a PE since the unsafe act automatically results in a “Fail” rating on the PE. 6.7.6.3.2.7.  A  technician  fails  to  document  maintenance  actions  in  appropriate equipment records. 6.7.6.3.2.8.  For  nuclear  weapons  maintenance,  an  unsatisfactory  rating  must  be given  when  any  deficiencies  or  applicable  unsatisfactory  conditions  exist  IAW Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  Instruction  (CJCSI)  3263.05,  Nuclear Weapons Technical Inspections, or AFI 21-200.  (T-0). 6.7.7.  Inspections:  An  inspection  represents  inspections  of  equipment,  programs  and processes to ensure compliance with established standards. Inspections are rated as “Pass” or “Fail”. Inspections include: 6.7.7.1.  Quality  Verification  Inspections  (QVI).    A  QVI  is  an  inspection  of  equipment condition, or a maintenance process, an assessment following a maintenance inspection, servicing  or  repair  action,  or  verification  that  a  technician  or  supervisor  properly completed an inspection or repair action. 6.7.7.1.1.  QVIs  shall  not  be  conducted  after  equipment  operation  when  such operation could invalidate indications of proper job accomplishment. 6.7.7.1.2.  Limit QVIs to the same inspection card deck or technical data required for the job. This inspection does not require disassembling parts, removing stress panels or like actions. 6.7.7.1.3.  A QVI required for -6 TO inspections may be accomplished by checking a portion of the required card or area.   106  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 6.7.7.1.4.  The  QVI  report  should  reflect  deficiencies  by  the  individual  who accomplished the task and identify specific discrepancies. 6.7.7.1.5.  Document these discrepancies in active equipment records and forms (i.e., AFTO Form 781A, AFTO Form 244, Industrial/Support Equipment Record). 6.7.7.1.6.  Rate QVIs “Pass” or “Fail” by comparing the number of discrepancies with the established AQLs/standards. 6.7.7.1.6.1.  Pass:  Number  of  discrepancies  does  not  exceed  established AQL/standard. 6.7.7.1.6.2.  Fail: An inspection that results in any of the following: 6.7.7.1.6.2.1.  A  technician  fails  to  detect  a  major  discrepancy  while complying with an inspection or TO requirement. 6.7.7.1.6.2.2.  Number of CAT  I minor discrepancies exceeds the established AQL/standard. 6.7.7.1.6.2.3.  A  technician  is  not  signed  off  in  training  records  as  task qualified. 6.7.7.1.6.3.  Document the QVI in the MAJCOM-approved QA database. 6.7.7.1.6.3.1.  Each  QVI  is  chargeable  to  the  technician  or  supervisor  who signed  off/cleared  the  “corrected  by”  block  or  “inspected  by”  block  of  the applicable maintenance form or equipment record. 6.7.7.1.6.3.2.  When  evaluating  the  technician  who  signed  off  the  “inspected by” block, evaluate only the items normally verified by signing off the “Red-X”. 6.7.7.1.6.3.3.  Only one evaluation is scored for each inspection. 6.7.7.2.  Management Inspection (MI).  Perform these inspections to follow-up on trends, conduct investigations or conduct research to get to the root cause of problems.  GP/CCs, SQ/CCs  or  work  center  supervisors  may  request  MIs.    MIs  may  encompass  PE/QVI trends  and  other  inspection  data,  NMC  causes,  aborts  and  trends,  in-flight  emergency trends, high component or system failure rates, suspected training deficiencies, and tasks outlined  in  aircraft  -6  TOs.    MI  results  are  reported  to  the  requester.    MIs  can  be  non-rated and may be counted in QA trends.  The MAJCOM-approved QA database will be used to document MIs.  (T-1). 6.7.7.3.  Special Inspections (SI).  SIs are inspections not covered by QVIs, PEs or MIs.  SIs  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  aircraft  and  equipment  forms  inspections, document  file  inspections,  CTKs,  TO  files,  vehicle  inspections,  housekeeping,  safety practices, FOD Program, etc. SIs may be condition, procedural or compliance oriented. 6.7.7.3.1.  The  MAJCOM-approved  QA  database  will  be  used  to  document  special inspections. (T-1). 6.7.7.3.2.  When  rating  an  SI,  rate  as  “Pass”  or  “Fail”  based  on  established AQLs/standards. AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   107  6.7.8.  Discrepancy Reporting.  Report all discrepancies to the applicable work centers. 6.7.8.1.  QA will provide an authoritative source reference for all reported discrepancies (e.g. work cards, job guides, WUC manuals, checklists, occupational safety requirements, TOs, and other applicable references).  (T-1). 6.7.9.  Units  will  grade  their  MSEP  evaluations  using  objective  ratings  based  on  the following five-tier rating system: 6.7.9.1.  Outstanding:  95-100%  (T-1). 6.7.9.2.  Excellent:  90-94.99%  (T-1). 6.7.9.3.  Satisfactory:  80-89.99%  (T-1). 6.7.9.4.  Marginal:  70-79.99%  (T-1). 6.7.9.5.  Unsatisfactory:  0-69.99%  (T-1). 6.7.9.6.  Inspections and evaluations performed (e.g., PE, SI, QVI) are rated “Pass/Fail”. Exception:  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  AFI  21-200  and  AFI  21-204  for  Nuclear Weapons PEs and Certification Program. 6.7.9.7.  Ratings are calculated by dividing the total number of inspections passed by total completed.  For example, QA inspects 10 aircraft preflights with the following results: 9 “passes” and 1  “failure”.  Divide the total  “passes” by the total  inspections (9/10=0.90) 90 percent for an “Excellent” rating. 6.7.9.7.1.  Deduct 0.5 percentage points from overall percentage grade for each TDV, DSV,  and  UCR.    For  example,  a  squadron  earns  an  overall  rating  of  90  percent, “Excellent”, however, QA observed 4 TDVs and 3 DSVs.  Multiply the  sum  (7) by 0.5 and subtract the product (3.5) from the original 90 percent.  The adjusted total is 86.5 percent; therefore, the squadron is rated “Satisfactory”. 6.7.10.  A cumulative MXG score will be determined by dividing the Group’s total number of inspections and evaluations passed by the total inspections and evaluations completed.  (T-1). 6.7.10.1.  Deduct  0.5 percentage points for each  TDV, DSV, and  UCR from  the  overall percentage grade, using same formula in paragraph 6.7.10.7.1 of this instruction. 6.7.11.  Monthly  Summary.    QA  shall  publish  and  distribute  the  monthly  summary  to  the MXG/CC or equivalent and inspected organizations.  (T-1). 6.7.11.1.  For  security  purposes,  classified  portions  of  the  MSEP  will  be  published separately from the main summary.  (T-1). 6.7.11.2.  QA  will  compile  the  summary  from  inspection  data  and  load  crew  evaluation statistics (provided by WS). 6.7.11.3.  The  MSEP  summary  should  include  visual  information,  graphs,  narratives, quality  trends  identified  through  inspections  and  evaluations,  discussion  of  common problem areas and descriptions of successful programs or initiatives. 6.7.11.4.  The following areas must be addressed in the summary:   108  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 6.7.11.4.1.  Compliance with and currency of TOs and directives to include unit.  (T-1). 6.7.11.4.2.

A  high-missed  carded  item  is  defined  as  any  work  card  item missed at least three times during a one-month period. 6.7.11.4.10.2.  Units  should  use  the  high-missed  carded  items  to  enhance maintenance  training  programs,  detect  trends  and  improve  the  quality  of maintenance. 6.7.11.4.10.3.  MMA  will  review  items  to  identify  any  relationships  with  repeat, recur and CND trends.  (T-1). 6.7.11.4.11.  Narrative Report: The monthly narrative report must contain an analysis of the MSEP results, a summary of significant CAT I and II discrepancies, technical inspections and recommendations for improvement.  (T-1). 6.7.11.4.11.1.  Prior to preparing the narrative report, QA will conduct a study of trends.  (T-1). 6.7.11.4.12.  Trend  Analysis.  QA  will  review  previous  reports  to  determine  if inspected areas have improved or declined.  (T-1). 6.7.11.4.12.1.  Consistent high scores in any category may indicate the programs emphasis  is  not  focused  on  the  unit’s  actual  problem  areas.  Low  scoring  areas may  require  a  reassessment  of  the  corrective  actions  taken  by  management. Continuous  communication  between  MMA,  unit leadership,  maintenance supervision, and QA personnel is essential. 6.7.11.4.12.2.  Highlight trends and root causes in the summary. 6.7.12.

Do  not  fly  FCFs  in  conjunction  with  other  missions  or  training  requirements, unless authorized in TO 1-1-300.  (T-1). 6.13.5.  FCF  Release.  An  FCF  release  occurs  upon  the  successful  completion  of  all requirements  as  determined  by  the  FCF  aircrew.  The  final  decision  to  release  rests  solely with the aircraft commander.  An aircraft may be released for flight if a malfunction occurs during  an  FCF,  which  is  not  related  to  the  condition  generating  the  FCF  and  the  original condition checks good. 6.13.5.1.  An FCF conditional release may occur when the aircraft does not successfully complete FCF requirements due to a specific system malfunction.  The FCF aircrew, in coordination with maintenance, determines a FCF conditional release if the malfunction may  be  corrected  without  generating  another  FCF.    If  upon  review  of  the  corrective action,  the  FCF  aircrew  accepts  the  maintenance  action  as  a  satisfactory  repair  of  the malfunction, they may release the aircraft from FCF. 6.13.6.  MAJCOMs will issue instructions for FCF procedures away from home station. 6.14.  Inflight  Operational  Checks.

Rules  of  Impoundment  Specifically  for  Explosive-Related  Events/Mishaps.  When  an inadvertent release or an explosive mishap is reported, the following procedures will apply: 7.7.1.  In-flight: 7.7.1.1.  When the involved aircraft returns to the de-arm or parking area, the aircraft will be impounded.  (T-1).  Limit maintenance actions to those required to make the aircraft safe. 7.7.1.2.  The MXG/CC, MOC, Munitions Control, WWM, QA and Wing Safety will be notified of the impoundment action.  (T-1). 7.7.1.3.  The  aircraft  with  unsafe  munitions  will  be  parked  and  isolated  in  an  area approved by the weapons safety office and airfield management.  (T-1). 7.7.1.4.  Investigate and report the incident IAW AFI 91-204.  (T-1). 7.7.2.  Ground: 7.7.2.1.  The  senior  ground  crew  member  will  be  in  charge  of  the  aircraft  or  equipment until relieved and will ensure involved persons remain at the scene.  (T-2). 7.7.2.2.  Protect  other  aircraft  or  equipment  located  near  the  incident  if  an  explosive hazard exists.  (T-1). 7.7.2.3.  Do not change the position of any switches except as needed for safety.  (T-1). 7.7.2.4.  Limit  maintenance  actions  to  those  actions  required  to  make  the  aircraft  or equipment safe.  (T-1). 7.7.3.  Preserve mishap evidence to the maximum extent possible.  (T-1).  An example would be  segregating  an  aircraft  gun  versus  destroying  it  if  it  poses  no  immediate  danger.    This allows for evaluation of all the evidence and the ability to recreate the mishap conditions. 7.7.4.  If an incident, malfunction, or mishap is suspected to have occurred or caused by in-use, installed, or otherwise configured munition (live or inert), or a 20 or 30MM gun system jam  creating  a  safety  condition,  notify  the  Global  Ammunition  Control  Point  (GACP)  Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Munition Division (AFLCMC/EBH) Munitions Rapid Response  Team  (MRRT):  DSN:  777-4865;  COMM:  (801)  777-5155  and  the  MAJCOM munitions staff.

(T-1). 8.5.7.  Tools which are accountable on a CA/CRL must be marked with a UII.  (T-1). Units need to safeguard any IUID marks.  In the event the UII is damaged, notify the responsible Equipment Custodian and/or EAE to replace the mark with the same UII.   130  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 8.6.  Tool and Equipment Marking and Identification. 8.6.1.  To ensure tool rooms have unique identifiers, wings (or equivalent) must ensure other units within the same wing or PAS code do not duplicate the WWID.  (T-1). All units must mark  their  tools  and  equipment  with  the  standard  EID.    (T-1).    Geographically  separated units may use the parent wing EID.  Replacement  spare tools stored in  the tool crib do not need  to  be  etched  until  placement  in  a  specific  CTK.8.6.1.1.  The  EID  will  consist  of  nine characters (numbers/letters) of which the first  four characters will be a unique World Wide Identification  (WWID)  code  (assigned  by  AF  Directorate  of  Logistics,  Maintenance Division, (AF/A4LM)).  (T-1). 8.6.1.1.1.  The  WWID  identifies  the  base  (first  and  second  character),  unit  (third character),  and  shop  (fourth  character).    The  remaining  five  characters  are  available for tool/CTK equipment numbering. 8.6.1.1.1.1.  The  first  two  characters  of  the  WWID  in  the  EID  are  based  on  the wing’s/unit’s Personnel Assignment System (PAS) base code.  Multiple wings (or equivalent) at the same base (i.e., ANG, AFRC, and RegAF) must have different WWID codes.  (T-1). 8.6.1.1.1.2.  The third and fourth characters designate the unit and shop by using unique/distinguishable characters.  To ensure tool rooms have unique identifiers, wings (or equivalent) must ensure other units within the same wing or PAS code do not duplicate the first 4 characters of the EID.  (T-1). 8.6.1.1.2.  Request  additional  “base”  codes  from  AF/A4LM  at  usaf.pentagon.af-a4.mbx.a4lm-m-maintenance-policy@mail.mil, DSN 222-2342/2343. 8.6.1.2.  The  unit  will  establish  the  remaining  five  characters  (any  combination  of numbers/letters) for CTKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment identification.  (T-1). 8.6.1.3.  Units must place the 9-digit EID on all CTKs, tools not assigned to a box, and dispatchable equipment that is of sufficient size.  (T-1). 8.6.1.3.1.  The 9-digit EID must be placed on the outside of dispatchable CTKs.  (T-1). 8.6.1.3.2.  Tools located inside the tool box may be marked with less than 9-digits but must  contain  the  4-digit  WWID  and  will  have  identifying  character(s)  that  ties  the tool  back  to  the  CTK.    (T-1).    For  example,  tools  inside  an  assigned  dispatchable CTK “U6JG00001” may be marked “U6JG1.”  Units may affix non-metallic bar code labels  on  tools  to  prevent  re-etching  as  long  as  the  use  of  the  tool  and  its  work environment  does  not  normally  result  in  excessive  damage  to  the  label  making  it unreadable. 8.6.1.3.3.  Tools will be marked with the most current EID.  (T-1). 8.6.1.3.4.  All  previous  CTK  identifiers  will  either  be  removed  or  marked  out  (this does not include PMEL markings).  (T-1). AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   131  8.6.1.3.5.  Small tools and/or items that cannot be marked as described above (such as drill  bits,  allen  wrenches  in  sets,  apexes,  etc.)  will  be  maintained  in  a  container marked with the EID and an identifying character(s) that ties the tool back to the CTK along with the number of tools contained.  (T-1). 8.6.1.3.5.1.  The container is counted as one of the items. 8.6.1.4.  MXG/CCs may require use of the EID in addition to AFTO Form 66 for TMDE routinely (i.e., once per week) dispatched from a work center or use of the AFTO Form 66 alone. 8.6.1.5.

This chapter describes materiel management support and general responsibilities and  requirements.    MAJCOMs  will  identify  specific  responsibilities  and  outline  unique  DMS requirements  necessary  to  support  wing  level  maintenance  and  mission  generation  operations, and  establish  processes  and  responsibilities  for  maintenance  units/work  centers  without  DMS support    in  supplements  and  addendums  to  this  AFI.    DMS  personnel  assigned  within maintenance units will follow the guidance in this instruction as well as the materiel management policy in 23-series publications. (T-1).  The AF has consolidated materiel management support under the AF Sustainment Center (AFSC).  The AFSC provides fleet-wide supply support to all AF weapon systems and leverages consolidated repair facilities and ALCs capability to optimize weapon system availability. 9.2.  Decentralized  Materiel  Support.  When  authorized  on  the  MXG  UMD,  DMS  personnel will  report  to  maintenance  activities.    (T-1).    DMS  personnel  coordinate  maintenance  and materiel  management  actions,  manage  supply  transactions  for  their  assigned  maintenance activity, monitor and track assets in the repair cycle, resolve support problems and report aircraft parts status to maintenance supervision.  DMS personnel also support maintenance in processing issue  requests,  researching  sources  of  supply,  entering  manual  requisitions  (part  number  only), updating exception code lists, and resolving other peculiar maintenance supply problems.  Refer to AFI 23-101 for additional guidance. 9.2.1.  In  units  with  DMS  personnel,  unit  leadership  in  coordination  with  the  LRS Superintendent  will  ensure  proper  career-field  development  opportunities  for  assigned 2S0XX personnel.  (T-1). 9.2.1.1.  Squadron  Superintendents  will  coordinate  with  the  LRS  Superintendent  to facilitate DMS personnel moves (N/A for ARC).  (T-1). 9.2.1.2.  The LRS Superintendent is responsible for rotation of 2S0XX personnel between LRS and MX activities. 9.2.2.  In  units/work  centers  without  assigned  DMS  personnel,  the  Logistics  Readiness Squadron  Materiel  Management  Flight  is  responsible  for  centralized  materiel  management support.  Roles and responsibilities for this process are listed in 23-series publications. 9.3.  Supply  Discipline.  Supply  discipline  is  the  responsibility  of  all  military  and  civilian personnel  regardless  of  grade  or  position.  Personnel  at  all  levels  need  to  ensure  the  practice  of good supply discipline IAW AFI 23-111, Management of Government Property in Possession of the Air Force. 9.4.  Parts ordering.  To minimize record discrepancies, all parts ordering will be initiated from the LRS/materiel management activity through the appropriate MIS when an interface with ILS-S exists.  (T-1).

Verify  and  monitor  backordered  requests  to  prevent  unwarranted  mission  limiting conditions, CANNs, priority abuses and wasted money.  (T-1).   138  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 9.5.2.  Track DIFMs.  (T-1). 9.5.2.1.  DIFM  inputs  are  critical  to  recording  and  getting  credit  for  proper  repair  cycle times. 9.5.2.2.  DIFM status codes are broken down into three categories; delayed maintenance time,  repair  time,  and  AWP  time.    Repair  time  is  the  only  time  recorded  and  used  to determine the number of assets that should be stocked.  Not using the proper codes when they change reduces the number of assets on base.  DIFMs should be reduced to as near zero  as  possible  since  credit  is  not  given  for  delayed  maintenance  or  AWP  time.    See  paragraph 9.21 of this chapter for additional information on DIFM management. 9.5.3.  Complete  Aircraft  Document  Reviews  (ADR)  as  outlined  in  Chapter  15  of  this instruction.  (T-1). 9.5.3.1.

Turn  in  excess  supply  parts  and  materiel  to  LRS/materiel  management  activity  IAW AFI 23-101.  (T-1). 9.6.6.  Process  TRN to record  usage of  an item  and ensure demand levels and percent  base repair are updated  IAW AFMAN 23-122.  (T-1). 9.7.  Readiness  Spares  Package  (RSP)  Review.  Maintainers  play  a  critical  role  in  the  annual RSP  review  process.  This  role  includes  active  maintenance  participation  in  the  base  level validation process conducted by the LRS and their MAJCOM during the annual RSP pre-review process  in  preparation  for  the  Weapon  System  Program  Manager  final  review.  Close maintenance-materiel management collaboration is essential to ensure RSPs are properly sized to support contingency maintenance requirements.  See AFMAN 23-122 for further details. 9.8.  Bench  Stock.  Flight  CCs/Chiefs  and/or  Section  NCOICs/Chiefs  will  determine  the contents of their bench stock IAW qualification criteria in AFMAN 23-122.  (T-1).  Examples of bench  stock  items  include:  nuts,  bolts,  cotter  keys,  washers,  resistors,  capacitors,  light  bulbs, sealants  and  batteries.    Bench  stock  levels  are  managed  and  based  predominantly  on consumption.  Monthly  and semi-annual  bench stock listings are provided by the  LRS/materiel management activity.  A thorough review of these listings is extremely important to ensure that bench stock supports the mission efficiently and economically. 9.8.1.  DMS or designated personnel will: AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   139  9.8.1.1.  Mark  bins  containing  50  percent  or  less  of  the  authorized  quantity  to  facilitate monthly  inventories.    (T-1).    Do  not  include  items  coded  TCTO,  unacceptable  for  AF use, critical, classified or sensitive in bench stocks. 9.8.1.2.  Maintain  environmentally  sensitive  items  in  their  original  container.    (T-1).  If removed from original container, place items in a sealed package and clearly mark them to  prevent  misidentification  and  misuse  (e.g.,  seals,  desiccant,  filters,  circuit  cards, sealants). 9.8.1.3.  Remove  unidentifiable  items  or  items  whose  serviceability  is  unknown,  from bench stock bins and process them as shop scrap through DLADS.  (T-2). 9.8.1.4.  Control and secure any precious metals displayed.  (T-1). 9.8.1.5.  Set up fixed or mobile bench stocks to provide quick and easy access to bits and pieces needed to support maintenance efforts.  (T-2).  Ensure mobile bench stocks do not present a FOD hazard. 9.8.1.6.  Identify and control the issue and turn-in of hazardous materials/items on bench stock listings.  (T-1). 9.8.2.  Work center supervisors will: 9.8.2.1.  Semi-annually  complete  a  bench  stock  joint  review  with  the Customer  Support Liaison Element (CSLE), Materiel Control.  (T-1). 9.8.2.1.1.  During these reviews, special emphasis needs to be given to items with no demands  in  the  past  year  and  items  with  excessive  quantities  not  supported  by demands.    The  continuance  of  stocking  such  items  is  the  exception  and  not  the normative process.  See AFMAN 23-122 for further details. 9.9.  Consumable  Readiness  Spares  Package (CRSP).  The  CRSP  process  provides requirement  and  asset  visibility,  has  automated  transfer  and  deployment  procedures,  has  the capability  to  provide  the  correct  priority  and  project-coded  replenishment  requisitions,  and eliminates redundant requirements.  Additionally, CRSP procedures provide MAJCOMs with a standard process to support consumable item requirements during contingency operations.  Refer to AFMAN 23-122 for CRSP procedures and options. 9.10.  Shop  Stock.  Shop  stock  includes  gas  cylinders,  random  length  bar  stock,  sheet  metal, plastic, fabric, electrical wire, and similar items not normally included in bench stocks.  Maintain shop  stock  for  day-to-day  operations.    Monitor  shop  stock  to  prevent  materiel  from  becoming excessive or outdated.  Shop stock should not normally exceed 90-days usage, or the unit of issue or  unit  pack,  whichever  is  greater.  Store  shop  stock  near/adjacent  to  bench  stock  items,  if practical, but do not mix them together. Clearly identify materiel as “Shop Stock” and label them with noun, national stock number or part number, unit of issue, and shelf-life, if applicable. 9.11.  Operating  Stock.

AF Munitions Policy.  AF munitions policies are contained in AFI 21-200, Munitions and Missile Maintenance Management, and AFI 21-201.  AF nuclear munitions policy is contained in AFI 21-204. 10.1.1.  Live  and  inert  missiles  (or  electrical  simulators)  of  the  same  type  (i.e.  CATM  with Air to Air) must not be loaded or flown together on an aircraft for any purpose.  (T-2).  Live and  inert  (to  include  training  or  practice)  bombs  must  not  be  loaded  in/on  the  same dispenser/rack or flown on an aircraft load together.  (T-2). Any request  to deviate from or waiver  to  this  policy  must  be  coordinated  through  the  WWM,  and  must  be  submitted  via official  message  to  the  MAJCOM  Munitions  Division,  Weapons  Safety,  and  Operations Weapons and Tactics/Training Divisions.  (T-2).  Note:  Units that fly rocket pods will not fly TP rockets with any combination of live rockets.  Note: With SPO/Seek Eagle approval, configurations  with  inert  AGMs  can  be  flown  with  all  types  of  bombs  and  rockets.    The MAJCOM  Munitions  Division  is  the  sole  approval  authority  for  these  deviations/waivers.  Test  organizations  may  load  and  fly  live  and  inert  munitions  on  the  same  aircraft  for  test missions  only,  as  long  as  the  flight  profile  is  IAW  an  approved  test  directive  that  has  been through a Safety Review Board process and flight clearance through the applicable SPO/Seek Eagle office has been properly obtained. 10.1.2.  Request for waiver of, or deviation to, this policy will include as a minimum: (1), an Operational Risk Assessment report and proposed controls to mitigate or eliminate hazards to personnel,  damage  to  aircraft  and  support  equipment  or  inadvertent  employment  of  live ordnance,  and  (2),  a  signed  copy  of  the  Test  Requirement  Plan,  Test  Plan,  or  Concept Employment Plan.  (T-2). Approved requests will remain valid only for the event requested and will not exceed 60 days.  (T-2). 10.1.3.  Captive  Air  Training  Munitions  (CATM).    Safety  pins/streamers  for  arming keys/safe-arm  handles  on  CATMs  may  be  removed  for  daily  training/flying  operations provided positive control and accountability is maintained for these items. 10.1.3.1.  CATM  AIM-9M  arming  handles  will  be  permanently  removed.    (T-1).  These components are only removed for foreign or dropped object prevention. 10.1.3.2.  Any  CATM  missiles  used  for  exercises,  Load  Crew  Training  and  inspections should  be  configured  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  with  all  safety  devices  and components to mirror the parent tactical munitions. 10.2.  Unit  Committed  Munitions  List (UCML),  Test/Training  Munitions  List (TTML).  Operational units will use UCMLs, Test/Training (AETC and AFMC only  (includes ARC associated units in these commands)) will use TTMLs unless they already require a UCML (i.e.,  NORAD  Committed).    (T-1).    The  UCML/TTML  is  a  list  of  Primary  Munitions  (PM), Support  Munitions  (SM),  and  Limited-use  Munitions  (LM)  necessary to  meet  unit operational/test/training requirements and is published IAW this instruction.  The list of PM will not  include  more  than  10  individual  munitions  or  Munitions  Family  Groups  (MFG)  combined per  mission,  design,  and  series  (MDS)  aircraft  assigned.    (T-2).    The  UCML/TTML  also AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   147  specifies the minimum certified load crews required to meet unit requirements.  MAJCOMS may supplement UCML/TTML processing, coordination and appendix requirements. 10.2.1.  As  a  minimum,  UCML/TTML’s  will  be  updated  annually  to  identify  all  munitions tasked  and/or  required  to  support  test/training  or  OPLANs  and  Designed  Operational Capability  (DOC)  statements.    (T-1).    Additional  munitions  may  be  included  on  the UCML/TTML  as  SM  or  LM  munitions  if  required  by  the  unit  or  designated  by  the MAJCOM  (A4M  performs  this  in  the  ANG)  to  support  test,  training,  or  deployment.    The UCML/TTML is the base document for aircrew and load crew training munitions forecasts, authorizations  and  operations.    Units  will  start  their  UCML/TTML  validation  in  July,  and have a coordinated input to the MAJCOM Munitions Division in August.  (T-2).  MAJCOMs will supply approved UCML/TTML to the units in September.  Note:  Specified months not applicable to ANG process. 10.2.2.  Unit  changes to  the UCML/TTML will be justified by Wing Weapons and Tactics, coordinated  and  processed  through  the  WWM,  Munitions  Squadron/Flight,  MXG/CC  and OG/CC before sending it to higher headquarters and MAJCOM.  (T-2). 10.2.3.  Standard Conventional Load (SCL) lists are not part of the UCML/TTML. They are stand-alone documents. 10.2.4.  The WWM determines the minimum number of certified load crews depicted on the UCML.    The  minimum  number  should  be  based  on  supporting  the  initial/lead  Unit  Type Code  (UTC)  requirements.    Additionally,  follow-on  UTCs  tasked  simultaneously  with  the initial/lead  UTC  will  be  considered  to  determine  minimum  load  crew  requirements.    The WWM  determines  the  number  of  load  crews  depicted  on  the  TTML  as  required  to  meet training  unit  syllabus  and/or  test  unit  mission  requirements.    Note:    WWM  will  specify  in writing  the  minimum  number  of  load  crews  required  in  aggressor  units  when  no UCML/TTML exists.  (T-1). 10.3.  Weapons  Load  Crew  Training  Program  (WLCTP).  The  USAF  WLCTP  ensures  all weapons load crew members obtain and maintain the certification/qualification and proficiency needed  to  effectively  meet  safe,  secure,  and  efficient  munitions  loading/unloading  operations supporting their unit’s mission.  The objective of the WLCTP is to develop and maintain a high state  of  mission  readiness  for  immediate  and  effective  generation/employment  of  munitions loaded  aircraft.    WLCTP  provides  the  basis  for  accomplishing  peacetime  missions  while maintaining critical wartime capability.  The WLCTP is managed by Weapons Standardization. 10.3.1.  Weapons  Standardization  (WS).    WS  plans  and  conducts  nuclear  and  conventional weapons load certification and training requirements to support unit tasking and operational plans.    WS  is  comprised  of  the  superintendent,  the  LSC,  lead  crews  and  an  academic instructor.  WS  will  manage  and  govern  the  Weapons  Standardization  Program.    (T-1).    In TFI-associated units, the WWM will ensure ARC/RegAF  LSC (minimum  of two certifying officials) are available to cover weekend loading evaluations. (T-2).  This arrangement must be in writing (grade, names) and reviewed on an annual basis.  (T-2). Training, certification and  qualification  required  to  load  munitions  on  aircraft  are  only  provided  by  Weapons Standardization. 10.3.2.  Weapons  Standardization  Program.    The  Weapons  Standardization  Program  is established to ensure munitions loading standardized training, procedures, and policies, are in   148  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 place to support mission requirements.  The Weapons Standardization Program is made up of the  WS  personnel,  weapons  academic  training,  practical  training,  munitions  loading certification,  weapons  task  qualification,  and  proficiency  evaluations.    These  core  elements are  managed  and  governed  by  the  WS.    WS  will  establish  and  manage  a  program  to  train, certify and maintain proficiency for each load crew based on the munitions designated by the UCML/TTML and/or those munitions designated by the WWM for SM’s and LM’s.  (T-1). 10.3.3.  WS  Superintendent  (SUPT)  Responsibilities.    The  WS  SUPT  is  responsible  to  the WWM,  and  performs  Section  NCOIC/Chief  duties  outlined  in  paragraph  3.10  of  this instruction.    The  WS  SUPT  develops  and  oversees  the  Weapons  Standardization  Program, sets  standards,  develops  local  policies  and  procedures,  and  interprets  all  technical  data  and directives  governing  the  Weapons  Standardization  Program.    Note:  ARC  &  Air  Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) WS SUPT responsibilities may be performed by the LSC Team Chief.  The WS SUPT will: 10.3.3.1.  Manage WLT training munitions, components, and accessories.  (T-1). 10.3.3.1.1.  Ensure load crew training munitions are maintained to the same standard and are representative of the parent munitions to the maximum extent possible.   (T-1). 10.3.3.1.2.  If defects exist that preclude the use of training munitions for WLT/DLO, they  will  be  turned  in  to  the  Munitions  Flight/Squadron  for  maintenance  or replacement IAW AFI 21-201. (T-1). 10.3.3.2.  Ensure  training  munitions  and  munitions  items  meet  unit  needs.    (T-1).    The UCML/  TTML  will  be  the  source  document  for  WLT  munitions  requirements  and authorizations and the WS SUPT must ensure correct munition variants are requested to support unit taskings.  (T-2). 10.3.3.2.1.  The  WS  SUPT  will  ensure  sufficient  quantities  of  load  crew  training munitions  are  forecasted  for  IAW  AFI  21-201  and  issued  assets  are  serviceable  to support both load crew and DLO training programs.  (T-1). 10.3.3.2.1.1.  If  sufficient  training  munitions  are  not  available  to  support  DLO training, coordinate use of assigned items from WS supply point for management flexibility. 10.3.3.2.2.  The WS SUPT will review and validate all munitions forecasts submitted by WS and the Armament Flight prior to submission to MAJCOM.  (T-1).  Refer to AFI  21-201  for  guidance  on  submitting  the  annual  non-expendable  air-munitions training forecast to the MAJCOM. the  Air  Force  Conventional  Munitions  SharePoint 10.3.3.2.3.  Training  munitions.  Authorized  quantities  of  training  munitions  are posted  in  the  “Air  Force  Standard  for  Non-Expendable  Air-Munitions  Training” located  on site  at https://cs.eis.af.mil/afmunitions/default.aspx.  These  numbers  reflect  the  maximum munitions  required  exclusively  for  weapons  load  crew  certification  and  recurring training.    These  munitions  are  forecasted  by  and  assigned  to  weapons  load  training (W1) accounts. AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   149  10.3.3.2.3.1.  Units may request and justify additional quantities of munitions than specified  on  these  tables  but  may  not  be  allocated  munitions  unless  sufficient quantities are available and approved. 10.3.3.2.4.  Units  with  multiple  MDS  will  use  the  authorization  for  the  MDS  that provides the greater quantity per item; these authorizations are not cumulative.  (T-1).  For example, if a base has both F-15E and F-16 aircraft assigned and both MDS are tasked  on  the  UCML/TTML  for  Guided  Bomb  Unit  (GBU)-12  then  only  two,  not four, GBU-12s will be allocated to support both MDS. 10.3.3.2.4.1.  If  a  situation  exists  where  the  WLT  facilities  are  physically separated  and  the  WWM  determines  it  negatively  impacts  load  crew  training  to move  munitions  from  one  to  the  other,  then  each  facility  will  be  authorized  the minimum number of tasked training munitions.  (T-2). 10.3.3.3.  Ensure  load  crews  demonstrate  proficiency  on  each  type  aircraft  racks  and stations prior to certification on that munition.  (T-1). 10.3.3.3.1.  For  conventional  munitions  capable  of  multiple  carriage,  both  aircraft parent station and multiple carriage loading are required. 10.3.3.3.2.  For  nuclear  weapons,  only  the  aircraft  stations  that  are  maintained  in nuclear certified status are loaded. 10.3.3.4.  Ensure  load  crews  are  familiar  with  fuze  inspection,  installation  and  wiring IAW MDS-33 series TO procedures or TO 11A-1-63, Munitions Assembly Procedures—Inspection and Assembly of Conventional Munitions.  (T-1). 10.3.3.4.1.  Conduct this training during initial certification. 10.3.3.5.  Ensure EPEs are performed on each LSC/Lead Crew  member  at  least  semi-annually  to validate standardization of the weapons load training program.  (T-1). 10.3.3.5.1.  Results will be documented on the AF Form 2419 and will be maintained within the WLCMT or MAJCOM approved equivalent.  (T-1). 10.3.3.5.2.  WWM  and/or  WS  SUPT  will  perform  EPEs  on  LSC  members  during load crew Semi-Annual Evaluations.  (T-1). Exception: For the 354th Fighter Wing (FW), EPEs will be accomplished during weapons task qualification training.  (T-1). 10.3.3.5.3.  LSC  members  perform  EPEs  on  Lead  Crew  members  during  load  crew MPRL evaluations.  (T-1). 10.4.  Loading  Standardization  Crew  (LSC).  The  LSC  is  assigned  to  WS  and  reports  to  the WS SUPT.  The LSC administers the Weapons Standardization Program and the WWM and/or WS SUPT evaluate and certify the LSC according to criteria in this AFI. 10.4.1.  The LSC Team Chief must be at least a TSgt 2W171.  (T-1). 10.4.2.  The LSC trains, evaluates, and certifies the lead crews and load crews. 10.4.2.1.  (ARC)  :  If  the  LSC  Team  Chief  is  performing  WS  SUPT  duties  then  the WWM will evaluate and certify the LSC. (T-1).   150  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 10.4.2.2.  The  LSC  will  perform  semi-annual  evaluations,  (quarterly  at  short  tour locations), on all certified load crews on at least one of the unit’s PM.  (T-1). Lead crew members may assist; however, at least one member of the LSC must be present.  (T-1). 10.5.  Weapons Academic Instructor.  A WS member is designated to oversee and manage the Weapons Academic Training Program. 10.5.1.  The WWM will designate WS members (minimum 7-skill level) as primary (primary instructor  will  be  a  permanently  assigned  individual  to  WS,  minimum  grade  of  TSgt)  and alternates, to conduct initial and recurring weapons academic training for all wing 2W1XXs (or equivalent contractor personnel).  (T-1). 10.5.1.1.  The instructors will have a SEI for at least one of the assigned MDS weapons system  and  familiarized  with  all  UCML/TTML  items  (SEI  is  not  applicable  for  ARC personnel).  (T-1). 10.5.2.  The  primary  academic  instructor  will  manage  the  Weapons  Academics  Training Program and associated materiel. (T-1). 10.5.3.

The  lead  crews  are  assigned  to  the  WS  and  assist  the  LSC  in  training, evaluating and certifying unit load crews in safe and reliable munitions loading procedures. 10.6.1.  For  contingency  operations  or  deployed  locations  a  lead  crew  should  deploy  to perform WS functions. 10.6.2.  If  a  lead  crew  is  not  deployed,  the  senior  2W1X1  weapons  loading  person  (with WWM  coordination)  on  location  will  have  WS  authority.    (T-1).    For  example,  a  new munition or load configuration is required to support operations and crews need to be trained on  location  (provided  Seek  Eagle  approval  has  been  granted  and  verified  technical data/procedures are available). 10.7.  Training Facilities/Aircraft. 10.7.1.  Practical training will be conducted in a facility dedicated to load crew training that is  of  sufficient  size  to  accommodate  required  aircraft,  training  munitions  and  associated support equipment.

When a member is decertified on a munition, the member will be decertified on all items within the MFG.  (T-1).  Personnel may recertify on any MFG item.  Note: Bomber  units  may  certify  by  loading  methods  for  nuclear  munitions.    This  will  be accomplished by documenting the munition method in block 7 of the 2435.  EXAMPLE, AGM-86/B Pylon, AGM-86/B CSRL, B-61/83 RLA, B-61/83 S/B etc. 10.11.2.4.1.  For  integrated  loads,  the  evaluator  may  decertify  on  all  munitions  or  a specific munition loaded.  When the same rating is not applied to all munitions loaded during an integrated load, the load crew records will be annotated accordingly.  (T-2). 10.11.2.4.2.  A  failure  for  safety  or  reliability  does  not  result  in  complete retraining/recertification for the loading task.  At the discretion of the evaluator, sub-task  retraining  or  thorough  critique  may  be  used  to  satisfy  retraining/recertification requirements. 10.12.  Proficiency Review Period.  Immediately following initial certification, crews will load one-third of all munitions monthly for a minimum of three months, after which the LSC or lead crew will recommend to the WS SUPT to place them in the normal bi-monthly evaluation cycle (NA for short tour locations, ARC, and part-time contractors).  (T-1). 10.13.  Minimum  Required  Proficiency  Load.  All  certified  load  crews  will  perform proficiency loads and be evaluated by the LSC or a lead crew.  (T-1). 10.13.1.  Each munition an individual is certified to load, regardless if it is a primary, support or limited use munition, will be loaded at least once within a six month period (three month period for short tour locations).  (T-1). 10.13.1.1.  One  third  of  the  required  munitions  will  be  loaded  bi-monthly  (monthly  for short tour locations) to demonstrate crew proficiency.  (T-1). 10.13.1.2.  WWM  will  ensure  munitions  with  multiple  configurations  such  as  JDAM MFG,  AIM-9  L/M/X  are  loaded  in  different  months  to  provide  adequate  munitions coverage during the year.  (T-1). 10.13.1.2.1.  Dual-status  technicians  in  Classic  Associations  will  load  to  the  above standard.  (T-1). 10.13.1.2.2.  Traditional  Guard  and  Reserve  members  in  Classic  Associations  will load to the ARC standard.  (T-1). 10.13.1.2.3.  ARC  and  RegAF  members  assigned  to  Active  Associations.    All UCML/TTML tasked munitions will be loaded/evaluated within a time-frame not to exceed 12 months.  (T-1). 10.13.2.  MPRL credit may be given during any certified loading operations on the flightline provided complete MPRL requirements are performed and evaluated by WS personnel not to exceed 1 MPRL credit per SAE (quarterly evaluation for short tour locations).  MPRL credit during  flightline  evaluations  is  only  authorized  when  loading  live  munitions,  Dummy  Air Training Missiles (DATM), or D-2 type inert munitions. 10.13.3.  In  units  where  no  munition  training  assets  exist  (Cluster  Bomb  Unit  CBU-105, M129,  etc.)  difference  training  will  be  provided  prior  to  initial  certification  and  during recurring academics training.  (T-1). AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   157  10.13.4.  Load crews in air defense/air superiority units perform proficiency loads bi-monthly using all committed primary munitions.  (T-1). 10.13.5.  Nuclear-tasked  units.  LSC,  lead  crews,  and  load  crews  will  load  nuclear  PMs monthly.  (T-1). 10.13.5.1.  Only one type of munition within a MFG requires loading each month. 10.13.6.  Load crew integrity must be used to the maximum extent possible.  (T-3). 10.13.6.1.  (ARC  Only)  :    Certified  Load  Crew  Chiefs  may  perform  MPRLs  in  any position provided they load under the supervision of LSC/lead crew using inert training munitions only. This stipulation applies at home station only.  No MPRL credit is given to those individuals during evaluations unless loading in the position for which they are certified.  This  enables  units  the  flexibility  to  evaluate  remaining  crew  members  when  a member may not be available to form a full crew and will only be used as a necessary. 10.13.7.  Load crews will annually perform an evaluated load while wearing the ground crew CWDE  using  33-1-2/33-2-1  procedures.    (T-2).    Credit  may  be  given  during  exercises provided operations are evaluated by WS personnel.  (T-2). 10.14.  Load Crew Semi-Annual Evaluations (SAE).  The LSC evaluates each load crew once semi-annually on at least one of the unit PMs (SM or LM if no PM listed); all unit PMs will be used on a rotating basis.  (T-1). 10.14.1.  SAE’s are not required for lead crews. 10.14.2.  Load crews failing to accomplish semi-annual evaluations on all munitions will be decertified unless exempted IAW provisions in this chapter.  (T-1). 10.14.3.  If an integrated load is accomplished as the SAE (e.g., AIM-9, -120), document the SAE accordingly. 10.14.4.  There is no need to document both SAE and MPRL.  Note: (ARC Only) CSO (A-10,  F-15,  F-16)  and  DLO  (bombers  only)  procedures  may  be  used  to  fulfill  these requirements provided the entire load is evaluated. 10.14.5.  Certified Load Team Chiefs may perform SAEs in any position provided they load under the supervision of LSC or lead crew using inert conventional training munitions only.  This requirement applies at home station only. 10.14.6.  No SAE credit will be given to those individuals during evaluations unless loading in  the  position  for  which  they  are  certified.    (T-1).  This  enables  units  the  flexibility  to evaluate remaining crew members when a member may not be available to form a full crew and will only be used as a necessary. 10.14.7.  The letter "E" will be placed after the date for the semi-annual evaluation regardless of rating.  (T-1). 10.15.  Documenting Load Crew Certification/Decertification/Qualification. 10.15.1.  The  LSC  will  manage  load  crew  certifications,  qualifications,  SAEs  (quarterly evaluation  for  short  tour  locations),  and  MPRLs  by  means  of  the  WLCMT  or  MAJCOM approved equivalent.  (T-1).   158  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 10.15.1.1.  All decertification and subsequent recertification actions must be documented on AF Form 2435 via WLCMT or MAJCOM approved equivalent process.  (T-1). 10.15.2.  Enter  one  of  the  following  codes  in  the  month  column,  as  applicable,  if  required loads  are  not  completed  and  provisions  of  this  chapter  apply:  Temporary  Duty  (TD), Emergency Leave (LV), Incapacitated (ED), Exercises/Contingency (EX), or Weather (WX).  (T-1). 10.15.2.1.  Code  outs  will  not  be  used  as  a  substitute  for  ineffective  scheduling.    (T-1).  WWM has final decision authority on coding disputes. 10.15.2.2.  RPA  contractor  personnel  who  deploy  immediately  after  weapons  load certification are not required to be coded out monthly. 10.15.2.3.  Members who have completed all required training and have an annotated AF Form 2419 are not required to be coded out for the duration of TDY. 10.15.2.3.1.  Member  will  be  decertified  IAW  paragraph  10.11.2.1.1    of  this instruction upon return from TDY.  (T-1). 10.15.3.  Route  AF  Form  2419  after  semi-annual  evaluations  (quarterly  for  short  tour locations) to the Weapons Section NCOIC/Chief, Operations Officer/MX SUPT, WWM, and the WS SUPT.  (T-1). 10.15.4.

All  munitions  listed  in  a  single  block  comprise  a MFG  for  the  respective  aircraft  mission  type.  The  load  time  standards  apply  to  all  operational users  of  the  munitions  or  aircraft  listed  and  are  the  minimum  proficiency  requirements  for weapons load crews. 10.17.1.  Units may establish more restrictive standards for local use. 10.17.2.  Unless  otherwise  noted  in  Table  10.1,  Table  10.2,  or  Table  10.3,  the  WS  SUPT shall  determine  and  set  load  time  standards  for  qualification  items,  for  integrated  loads (including nuclear, if tasked), and for loads performed wearing CWDE.  (T-3). 10.17.3.  All items require certification IAW this chapter, unless otherwise indicated. 10.17.4.  The standard load times, from the MFG Table 10.1, Table 10.2, and Table 10.3 are standard load times for initial and recurring training and evaluations for the respective single store (including full munitions preparation) and installation of impulse cartridges, if required. 10.17.4.1.  Except  for  BRU-57,  an  additional  10  minutes  is  allowed  for  each  added aircraft station check on fighter aircraft, if performed as part of an evaluated load. 10.17.4.2.  An additional 7 minutes is allowed for each like store added to fighter aircraft loads. 10.17.4.3.  Load  times  are  additive  when  more  than  one  type  of  munition  is  loaded  on fighter aircraft.  For example, if an F-16 is to be loaded with two AIM-9s and a MK-82, the load crew shall be allowed 20 minutes for the first  AIM9, 7 minutes for the second AIM-9, and 25 minutes for the MK-82, for a total of 52 minutes. 10.17.4.4.  Loads  may  be  accomplished  without  full  munitions  preparations;  however, more restrictive time standards must be developed. 10.17.4.5.  Units  may  develop  optimum  time  standards  for  integrated  loads  (including nuclear, if tasked). AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   161  Table 10.1.

Facility  Housekeeping  and  Contamination  Control.  Units  will  publish  housekeeping and contamination procedures which protect the health of workers and maintain areas as free as practical from surface contamination.  (T-1).  Units will: 11.1.1.  Ensure  Bioenvironmental  Engineering  (BE)  approved  workplace-housekeeping procedures are employed to prevent the spread of contamination within a work center.  (T-1). 11.1.2.  Emphasize  controlling  the  source  of  the  contamination  and  ensure  workplace personnel follow proper work procedures, PPE use, and hygiene practices. (T-1). 11.1.3.  Ensure housekeeping procedures will account for the dangers and hazard exposures found in the work center  and will be consistent with mitigation methods outlined in AFI 91-203.  (T-1). 11.2.  Personal Wireless Communications Systems (PWCS) Management. 11.2.1.  Maintenance  Communications.    Reliable,  redundant,  and  effective  communications systems  are  essential  for  efficient  maintenance  operations.  These  systems  should  provide accurate, timely, secure, programmable frequency and jam resistant communications needed to  accomplish  the  maintenance  mission  in  a  fully  deployed  and  isolated  mode.    The MXG/CC has the overall responsibility to ensure adequate PWCS communication support is available to support mission requirements. 11.2.2.  Commanders  or  designated  representative  will  implement  and  comply  with  the PWCS  management  requirements  IAW  AFI  33-590,  AFI  33-580,  Spectrum  Management, AFI 33-200, and AFMAN  33-153, Information Technology (IT) Asset Management(ITAM).

Allowance  for  specific radios  is  shown  in  AS  660,  Equipment  Allowances for Non-Weapon  Systems  Communications  Requirements,  Repair  Cycle  Data  Listing. Process requests for specific radio equipment to support maintenance activities IAW AFI 23-101, AFI 33-590, AFI 33-580, AFI 33-200, and AFH 23-123V3, Air Force Equipment Management. 11.2.3.  A  VHF/UHF  radio  is  authorized  for  use  in  maintenance  operations  to  facilitate communications  between  aircraft  and  maintenance  personnel.    Additionally,  aircrews  may relay  advance  aircraft  status  information  to  maintenance  personnel  using  VHF/UHF channels. 11.2.3.1.  Maintenance  Operations  will  coordinate  procedures  for  use  of  these  radio communications with operations and other essential wing organizations.  (T-1). 11.2.3.2.  For  effective  flightline  operations,  more  than  one  non-tactical  radio  nets  are authorized  when  large  numbers  or  different  types  of  weapon  systems  are  assigned  or when ASs so specify. AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   165  11.3.  Special  Certification  Roster  (SCR).  The  SCR  is  a  management  tool  providing supervisors  a  clear  and  concise  listing  of  personnel  who  have  been  appointed  to  perform, evaluate, and/or inspect work of a critical nature.  Normally, only maintenance requirements that have  a  definite  potential  for  personnel  injury  or  damage  to  equipment  will  be  included  in  the SCR.  Other tasks requiring special training or qualifications may be managed on the SCR.  The SCR  is  used  to  build  personnel  rosters  for  deployments,  shift  schedules,  and  assess  workforce capability.  The MXG/CC and CD are not required to be on the SCR by virtue of their position as the SCR approval authority. 11.3.1.  MXG/CC will approve items identified in Table 11.1, Note 1.  (T-1). 11.3.1.1.

Aircraft Grounding. 11.4.1.  Definition.    Aircraft  grounding  is  an  administrative  action  taken  to  prohibit  aircraft from flying because of a specific condition related to the aircraft or based on requirements of a  directive.    Implemented  from  a  higher  echelon  of  command  (MAJCOM/CC)  when conditions  in  multiple  aircraft,  engines,  missiles,  munitions,  or  related  installed  flight equipment  create  a  sufficient  risk  to  personal  injury  or  equipment  damage  which  warrant fleet grounding until the matter can be properly investigated and resolved. AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   171  11.4.1.1.  This  section  does  not  apply  to  conditions  which  are  clearly  limited  to  the affected  unit/base  (e.g.,  lost  tool,  fluid  contamination,  aircraft/equipment  damage  of known  origin,  or  other  strictly  local  event).    In  these  circumstances,  the  affected  unit follows the impoundment procedures specified in Chapter 7 of this instruction. 11.4.2.  Initial Investigation.  The owning MXG/CC or equivalent will direct QA to develop a local OTI IAW TO 00-20-1 and this instruction.  (T-1). 11.4.2.1.  The  OTI  will  require  an  inspection  of  a  representative  number  of  systems  or units  (aircraft,  engines,  missiles,  or  munitions)  of  the  same  mission  and  design  to determine  if  the  condition  exists  on  other  aerospace  equipment  within  the  wing’s assigned aircraft/systems or equipment.  (T-1). 11.4.2.1.1.  If  initial  sampling  indicates  the  discrepancy  is  widespread  and  has  the potential  for  personal  injury  and/or  further  equipment  damage,  the  MXG/CC  will discuss  aircraft  grounding  with  the  WG/CC  and  forward  a  recommendation  to  the MAJCOM.  (T-1). 11.4.2.2.  If there is no repair or corrective action specified in technical data, QA will also submit  a  technical  assistance  request  through  the  MAJCOM  to  the  appropriate  weapon system program manager IAW TO 00-25-107 or equivalent process.  (T-1). 11.4.3.  Grounding  Authority.    The  approved  procedures  for  grounding  aircraft  or  stand-down for operational reasons are determined and executed IAW AFI 11-401.  (T-1). 11.4.3.1.  Notification  and  final  reporting  for  grounding  and  release  status  will  be accomplished  IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting.  (T-1). 11.4.3.2.  Annotate aircraft grounding in the aircraft forms IAW TO 00-20-1.  (T-1). 11.5.  Ramp Inspection Program.  Public Law 99-661 requires a pre-flight safety inspection of all  internationally  scheduled  charter  missions  for  the  transportation  of  members  of  the  Armed Forces departing the United States. 11.5.1.  Air  Mobility  Command  (AMC)  is  lead  for  the  DOD  in  the  management  and administration of the Ramp Inspection Program. 11.5.1.1.  AMC  will  publish  specific  guidance  for  this  Program  in  a  supplement  to  this instruction. 11.5.1.2.  AMC/A4M  will  coordinate  with  other  MAJCOMs  as  required  to  accomplish ramp inspections to ensure the maximum efficiency and utilization of resources. 11.5.1.3.  When requested by AMC, MAJCOMs will provide support to reduce the TDY and manpower impact associated with the execution of this program. 11.6.  Red  Ball  Maintenance.  The  term  “Red  Ball”  is  a  traditional  descriptor,  recognized throughout aircraft maintenance, and defines a situation requiring a sense of urgency and priority actions.  Red Ball maintenance normally occurs two hours prior to launch and until aircrew have released  the  aircraft  back  to  maintenance.  The  Red  Ball  maintenance  concept  is  intended  to prevent  late takeoffs and aborts by having qualified maintenance personnel  available (e.g., in  a truck or standby in the shop) during launch and recovery operations to troubleshoot, isolate, and repair  system  malfunctions.    Red  Ball  maintenance  does  not  authorize  technicians  to  take   172  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 shortcuts  or  deviate  from  TOs,  disregard  personnel  safety  requirements  or  fail  to  properly document the aircraft forms and the MIS for all completed repair actions. 11.6.1.  Units will ensure all maintenance repair  actions (does not  apply to incorrect  switch settings due to operator error) are documented in the aircraft forms and MIS during Red Ball, launch, or EOR operations and cleared from the aircraft forms prior to flight.  (T-1). 11.6.2.  Maintenance repair actions must be cleared in the MIS as soon as possible.  (T-1).  It is  imperative  that  maintenance  documentation  is  performed  regardless  of  the  timing  of  the action in the generation and launching of the aircraft. 11.6.3.  All grounding inputs must be cleared from the forms prior to flight.  (T-1). 11.6.4.  If  aircraft  status  changes,  an  ER  must  be  re-accomplished  by  a  certified  individual upon completion of maintenance and before the aircraft is released for flight IAW TO 00-20-1.  (T-1). 11.6.5.  Units  will  develop  written  procedures  to  capture,  document,  and  clear  Red  Ball maintenance actions in the event the MIS is down.  (T-1). 11.6.5.1.  Procedures must require MIS entry of Red Ball maintenance actions as soon as the MIS becomes operable.  (T-1). 11.7.  Maintenance Recovery Team (MRT):  MAJCOMs will publish standardized procedures to recover assigned aircraft at remote locations. 11.7.1.  Procedures at a minimum will identify how resources, including personnel, supplies, and equipment will be made available to support transient aircraft recovery. 11.7.2.  If  required,  establish  multiple  command  MOUs/MOAs/collaboration  necessary  to achieve efficient aircraft recovery. 11.8.  Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention Program.  All personnel (military, civilian, and  contractors)  working  in,  on,  around,  or  traveling  through  areas  near  aircraft,  flightline munitions,  AGE,  engines,  or  components  thereof  will  comply  with  FOD  prevention.    (T-1).  FOD  prevention  training  requirements  are  outlined  in  AFI  36-2650.    This  section  establishes minimum requirements for a FOD Prevention Program. 11.8.1.  The  WG/CV  is  responsible  for  ensuring  an  effective  FOD  prevention  program  is established. 11.8.2.  Definition.    FOD:  Any  damage  to  an  aircraft,  engine,  aircraft  system,  component, tire, munitions, or SE caused by a foreign object(s) (FO) which may or may not degrade the required safety and/or operational characteristics of the aforementioned items. 11.8.3.  FOD Prevention. 11.8.3.1.  On aircraft, uninstalled engines, LRUs and AGE. Openings, ports, lines, hoses, electrical connections, and ducts will be properly plugged or capped to prevent FO from entering the systems.  (T-1). 11.8.3.1.1.  Items that are actively being disconnected, installed, and/or removed will be capped IAW technical data or at completion of the task.  (T-1). AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   173  11.8.3.1.2.  At no time will items, (e.g., aircraft forms binders, Video Tape Recorder (VTR) tapes, checklists, tools.), be placed in or on engine intakes.  (T-1). Note:  Does not apply to technicians performing inlet maintenance, inspections and blade blending requiring lights, files, or other tools inside aircraft inlets. 11.8.3.1.3.

Covers  (e.g.,  engine,  pitot  tube(s)  to  include  ejection  seat)  need  to  remain installed on aircraft as close to crew show as possible to prevent FOD, as determined by MDS/local MXG/CC guidance. 11.8.3.4.  Technicians  should  use  a  light  source  of  sufficient  illumination  to  inspect  the aircraft intakes and exhaust for FO/FOD. 11.8.3.5.  Technicians  will  wear  a  pocketless,  zipperless,  buttonless  bunny-suit,  cloth over-booties  or  stocking  feet,  and  will  remove  boots  whenever  physical  entry  into  an aircraft intake or exhaust is required.  (T-1). 11.8.3.5.1.  Suits  are  not  required  to  be  worn  if  personnel  do  not  physically  enter these  areas.    A  rubber  mat  may  be  used  instead  of  cloth  over-booties  or  removing boots if MDS technical data directs. 11.8.3.5.2.  When  performing  intake  inspections  while  wearing  a  CWDE,  pockets will be emptied and all accessories removed.  (T-1). 11.8.3.5.2.1.  During  exercises/inspections,  the  CWDE  will  be  removed  and  the bunny-suit will be utilized.  (T-1). 11.8.3.5.2.2.  CWDE will be worn during “real world” situations only to minimize the  potential  for  FOD  and  intake  damage.    (T-1).    Note:  During  “real  world” situations, if CWDE metal zippers are exposed, cover them with any type of tape and account for the tape upon completion of the inspection. 11.8.3.6.  Each base will develop a local flightline clothing policy that addresses wearing of  hats,  badges,  and  passes  aimed  at  FOD  prevention  while  considering  climate  and safety.  (T-1). As a minimum, it will include the following requirements: 11.8.3.6.1.  Restricted area badges will be secured with a subdued non-metallic cord or plastic armband when worn on the flightline.

All  FOD-mishap  engines  and  modules  returned  to  the  depot  must  be properly marked on the outside of the packaging as a FOD-mishap asset.  (T-1). 11.8.6.2.3.  Mark  container  or  package  in  red  with  the  following  statement,  “FOD mishap investigation required.”  (T-1). 11.8.6.3.  FOD  incidents  are  classified  as  preventable  and  non-preventable.    Only preventable FOD over $50K (parts and labor) are to be chargeable to the FOD rate.  FOD is considered preventable except when the damaged can be attributed to the following: 11.8.6.3.1.  Caused  by  natural  environment  or  wildlife.    This  includes  hail,  ice, animals, insects, sand, and birds.  Report this type of damage IAW AFI 91-204.  Do not include these in the FOD rates. 11.8.6.3.2.  From internal engine materiel failure, as long as damage is confined to the engine. 11.8.6.3.3.  Caused  by  materiel  failure  of  an  aircraft  component  if  the  component failure  is  reported  as  a  DR  using  the  combined  mishap  DR  reporting  procedures  of AFI 91-204 and TO 00-35D-54. 11.8.6.3.4.  Found during depot overhaul for maximum operating time. 11.8.6.4.  Additionally, the following apply: 11.8.6.4.1.  Engine  damage  caused  by  improper  anti-ice/de-ice  procedures  by  either flight or ground crews are considered preventable. 11.8.6.4.2.  Engine or airframe damage caused by gunnery or rocket mission ricochets are considered non-preventable provided mission parameters were not exceeded and range cleaning was sufficient. 11.8.6.4.3.  Engine  and  propeller  damage  caused  by  rocks,  stones,  wood,  or  other objects  ingested  during  low  hover  operations  or  unimproved  runway  landings  are considered non-preventable, provided mission parameters were not exceeded.   178  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 11.8.6.4.4.  MAJCOMs  will  determine  reporting  criteria  for  FOD  incidences  that result in a blade blending requirement IAW applicable tech-data. 11.8.6.5.  Preventable FOD over $50K incurred at ETS or on trim pad will be chargeable.  (T-1). 11.8.6.6.  Appropriate  MAJCOM  offices  will  assist  in  resolving  any  questionable  FOD issues, (i.e., preventable or non-preventable). 11.8.6.7.  The Wing  FOD Monitor will provide  an initial  report of all  FOD incidents  to the MAJCOM FOD monitor within 24 hours of occurrence.  (T-1). 11.8.6.7.1.  A follow-up report will be required every 45 days until closeout.   (T-2).  Use the FOD report format as listed in Attachment 6 of this instruction. 11.8.6.7.2.  MAJCOMs  will  determine  FOD  standards,  MDS  specific  flying  hour source  data,  period  of  time  for  calculation,  reporting  procedures,  and  meeting frequency for units that exceed standards in their supplement to this AFI. 11.8.6.8.  FOD  rates  are  computed  by  MDS  as  follows:  Number  of  Preventable  FODs (damage exceeding $50K) ÷ Aircraft Flying Hours X 10,000 = FOD Rate. Note:  ALCs compute FOD rates as follows:  Number of Preventable FODs (damage exceeding $50K) ÷  Aircraft  Flying  Hours  X  1,000  =  FOD  Rate.  ALCs  compute  aircraft  flying  hours  by using  acceptance  flights,  functional  check  flights,  ground  runs,  and  the  number  of  un-installed  ETS starts. 11.8.7.  FOD  Prevention  Committee  Meeting.    This  meeting  is  mandatory  for  units  that exceed the MAJCOM-established standard.  (T-1). 11.8.7.1.  The WG/CV  will chair the meeting, if required,  and will determine minimum required attendees.  (T-1).  The purpose of this meeting is to identify negative trends and develop and execute action plans to resolve them. 11.8.7.1.1.  The MXG/CC (or equivalent) will chair the meeting in the absence of the WG/CV. (T-2). 11.8.7.2.  Meeting agenda items should include issues that resulted in the wing exceeding the FOD standard, such as: 11.8.7.2.1.  Total  number  of  airframe,  engine,  and  tire  FOD  incidents  during  the reporting  period.  Indicate  quantity  and  cause.  Current  status  of  all  other  pending incidents will be discussed. 11.8.7.2.2.  Mechanical/vacuum sweeper status. 11.8.7.2.3.  Review and refinement of the existing FOD prevention program. 11.8.7.2.4.  New directives/actions established to minimize FOD. 11.8.7.2.5.  Status and condition of engine run-up screens as applicable. 11.8.7.2.6.  Results  of  X-rays  for  FOs  during  engine  bay  inspections,  acceptance inspections,  and  PH  inspections.  Maintenance  trends  should  be  discussed  when  an increase in FO is discovered during these X-rays. 11.8.7.2.7.  Identification of potential FOD sources. AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   179  11.8.7.2.8.  Lost tools/items. 11.8.7.2.9.  Increased potential for FOD within the next 30-60 days. 11.8.7.2.10.  Dropped  objects.  Pay  particular  attention  to  those  that  result  in downstream FOD. 11.8.7.2.11.  Breakdown of FOD inspections/assessments. 11.8.7.2.12.  Cockpit FO incidents. 11.8.7.2.13.  Recognition  of  personnel  making  significant  contributions  to  FOD prevention (e.g. golden bolt program, FOD poster contests, or other FOD recognition programs locally-developed at each unit). 11.8.8.  Bird Strikes.  Consult TO 1-1-691, Cleaning and Corrosion Prevention and Control, Aerospace and Non-Aerospace Equipment, for bird strike clean-up procedures and AFMAN 91-223 for bird strike reporting procedures. 11.9.  Dropped  Object  Prevention  (DOP)  Program.  A  dropped  object  is  any  aircraft  part, component, surface, LO coating exceeding 8 inches in any dimension or other item lost during aircrew  operations  (unless  intentionally  jettisoned)  from  engine  start  to  engine  shutdown. Inadvertently  released  munitions  are  not  considered  dropped  objects  and  will  be  reported  IAW AFI 91-204.  Note:  Missing Chaff/Flare/Decoy end-caps are not reportable dropped objects. 11.9.1.  Responsibilities.  All units, which fly, service, or maintain aircraft, need to develop a DOP Program with the following provisions: 11.9.1.1.  MAJCOM  DOP  monitors  or  aircraft  functional  managers  will  act  as  OPR  for all dropped object inquiries IAW MAJCOM established standards. 11.9.1.2.  The  WG/CV  serves  as  the  Wing  DOP  Program  Manager  and  will  appoint  a Wing DOP Monitor.  (T-1). 11.9.2.  Investigation.  The DOP Monitor will investigate each dropped object incident.  (T-1). 11.9.2.1.  Every effort needs to be made to determine the precise cause to ensure positive corrective action is accomplished.  Anytime a materiel or design deficiency is the cause, or suspected cause, a DR will be submitted IAW TO 00-35D-54, even when an exhibit is not available.  (T-1). 11.9.2.2.  Investigation  results  will  be  distributed  to  each  appropriate  work  center  for inclusion in personnel training and education programs.  (T-1). 11.9.3.  Reporting.  Units will follow MAJCOM DOP Program reporting procedures.  (T-2). 11.9.3.1.  Transient  Aircraft.  The  host  Wing  DOP  Monitor  will  be  responsible  to investigate dropped objects from a transient aircraft.  (T-1). 11.9.3.1.1.  The  host  Wing  DOP  Monitor  will  provide  the  home  station  Wing  DOP Monitor with sufficient  data to  generate a report for trending and tracking  purposes.  (T-1).   180  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 11.10.  Aircraft  Structural  Integrity  Program  (ASIP).  The  ASIP  includes  requirements  for collection  and  evaluation  of  aircraft  usage  data  to  update  or  confirm  the  original  design  or baseline  spectrum  and  to  adjust  maintenance  intervals  on  an  individual  aircraft  basis.    The Loads/Environment  Spectra  Survey  (L/ESS)  data  is  collected  via  flight  data  recorders  of instrumented  aircraft  to  evaluate  the  loads  spectrum.    The  Individual  Aircraft  Tracking  (IAT) data is collected via flight data recorders or manual forms such as “bubble sheets” and the data is used to make maintenance/inspection/force structure decisions.  Both the L/ESS and IAT aircraft usage  data  programs  are  established  by  applicable  MDS-specific  TOs  and  AFI  63-140  and require  coordinated  action  by  a  number  of  base-level  maintenance  activities  to  achieve  the required data capture rates.  An effective ASIP aircraft usage data collection program is essential to  establish,  assess  and  support  inspections,  maintenance  activities,  repairs  and  required modification/replacement actions.  MAJCOMs will: 11.10.1.  Publish ASIP roles and responsibilities for each assigned weapon system IAW AFI 63-140. 11.10.2.  Ensure  operational  units  continuously  meet  authorized  reporting  requirements established by SPOs. 11.10.3.  Document  causes  and  corrective  actions  for  units  that  fail  to  meet  reporting requirements and retain until resolved or relief of the reporting requirement is granted from the SPO in writing. 11.11.  Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Program. 11.11.1.  MAJCOMs  will  establish  an  IFF  Program  for  aircraft  in  their  command  (if equipped). 11.11.1.1.  MAJCOM programs will identify additional requirements necessary to ensure status of IFF systems meets mission requirements. 11.11.2.  The  MXG/CC  will  appoint  an  IFF  Program  Manager  for  IFF  systems cryptographically keyed by MXG personnel (if equipped).  (T-1). 11.11.2.1.  Equipped  aircraft  will  be  checked  prior  to  its  first  sortie  of  the  day  during contingency operations.  (T-1). 11.12.  Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)/Radar Threat Warning (RTHW) Testing. 11.12.1.  MAJCOMs will  identify weapon systems  with  enhanced on-board diagnostics and internal testing capabilities which do not require external testing in their supplement to this instruction (if equipped). 11.12.1.1.  MAJCOMs  will  determine  non-contingency  system  functional  check requirements  necessary  to  ensure  RWR/RTHW  systems  are  maintained  operationally ready to meet mission requirements IAW the MDS MESL or equivalent. 11.12.2.  The MXG/CC will appoint a RWR/RTHW Manager (if equipped).  (T-1). 11.12.2.1.  The  RWR/  RTHW  Manager  will  coordinate  test  procedures  with  the  Wing Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) and the MXS, if applicable.  (T-2). 11.12.2.2.  The  RWR/RTHW  Manager  will  ensure  each  unit  accomplishes  the  required minimum number of checks as defined below.  (T-1). AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   181  11.12.2.2.1.  For  contingency  missions,  the  RWR/RTHW  Manager  will  coordinate with  the  EWO/Electronic  Combat  Officer  (ECO)  who  will  determine  system  check requirements and specific threats to be simulated.  (T-3). 11.12.3.  When  an  aircraft  is  found  to  have  a  malfunctioning  RWR/RTHW  system  prior  to flight, the AC determines the course of action based on operational needs and requirements. 11.13.  Cannibalization Program. 11.13.1.  General.  CANN  actions  may  be  necessary  when  a  condition  prevents  the accomplishment  of  a  mission  and  the  required  assets  are  not  immediately  available  from supply.  Prior  to  performing  a  CANN  action,  verify  the  required  component  cannot  be sourced from LRS, TNB or back shop.  When authorizing a CANN, the expenditure of man-hours  and  potential  damage  to  equipment  need  to  be  weighed  against  the  expected  benefit.  High  risk  CANNs  should  not  be  performed  unless  priority  aircraft  are  involved  or  lack  of ready equipment will impede mission accomplishment.  See Table 1.1 of this instruction and AFTTP 3.3. for additional guidance. 11.13.2.  Definition.  CANN is the authorized removal of a specific assembly, subassembly, or  part  from  one  weapon  system,  system,  support  system,  or  equipment  end  item  for installation on another end item to satisfy an existing supply requisition and to meet priority mission  requirements  with  an  obligation  to  replace  the  removed  item.    Weapon  systems, support systems,  or equipment include:  aircraft,  missiles, drones, RPA, uninstalled engines, uninstalled  engine  modules,  aircrew  and/or  launch  crew  training  devices,  C-E  equipment, AGE, TMDE, serviceable uninstalled pods, and guns. 11.13.3.  Responsibilities.    CANN  Authorities  (CA)  will  be  approved  by  the  MXG/CC  or equivalent and tracked in the MIS and SCR (see Table 11.1 of this instruction).  (T-1). 11.13.3.1.  CA will be SNCOs, officers or civilian equivalents.   (T-1).  These personnel are typically Pro Supers. 11.13.3.2.  Those  who  are  authorized  to  approve  CANNs  will  not  further  delegate  their responsibility.  (T-1). 11.13.4.  If  an  assembly  is  cannibalized  to  satisfy  a  condition  caused  by  lack  of  bits  and pieces (e.g., washers, nuts, and bolts), the assembly is counted as a CANN and the bits and pieces are considered transfer actions.  Bits and  pieces removed from  an end item  (without removing the assembly) for installation on another end item are considered individual CANN actions. 11.13.5.  When  a  required  part  cannot  be  delivered  and  installed  on  time,  the  CA  may approve  the  CANN  of  parts  before  the  initiation  of  CANN  documentation  (e.g.,  Red  Ball maintenance).  The  CA  will  give  this  approval  only  after  confirming  the  part  is  not  readily available in LRS, TNB, forward supply points, or back shops.  (T-1). 11.13.5.1.  The  CA  will  notify  the  appropriate  supply  activity  to  change  the  “mark-for” components in the document number.  (T-1). 11.13.5.2.  The  CA  will  also  ensure  complete  documentation  is  accomplished  for  each CANN action.  (T-1).   182  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 11.13.6.  When  TCIs,  serially-controlled  items,  items  affecting  compliance  of  a  TCTO,  or other  components  with  inspection  requirements  that  align  to  specific  hourly,  calendar,  or event limits are considered for CANN, the CA will coordinate with PS&D or EM to ensure adequate time remains on the item to justify the CANN and to ensure appropriate records are updated.  (T-1). 11.13.6.1.  If  the  CANN  action  takes  place,  the  performing  work  center  will  update  the MIS and notify PS&D or EM.  (T-1). 11.13.7.  Installed  engines  are  not  end  items;  installed  engines  are  considered  a  LRU  (e.g. similar to a radar component, gun, seat, canopy, radio, multifunction display unit, etc.). 11.13.7.1.  If a functional LRU is removed from one end item to put on another end item to fill a “hole” which was caused by a supply requisition, (the requisition could be against the LRU), then this is considered a CANN. 11.13.8.  Restrictions. 11.13.8.1.  Egress system component Cartridge/Propellant Activated Device (CAD/PAD) cannibalization  actions  are  considered  "High-Risk"  and  should  not  be  performed  unless priority  aircraft  are  involved  (i.e.  higher  headquarters/alert  status),  or  lack  of  ready equipment will impede mission accomplishment. 11.13.8.2.  To ensure system integrity and validation of the explosive CAD/PAD listing, cannibalization  of  egress  explosive  components  and/or  seats  will  not  be  accomplished without the approval of the MXG/CC or MXG/CD.  (T-3). 11.13.8.3.  After cannibalization actions, Red X discrepancies in the aircraft AFTO Form 781As will not be cleared until the MIS is verified.  (T-1). 11.13.8.3.1.  (2A6X3)  Egress personnel will accomplish this action.  (T-1). 11.13.8.4.  CANN  actions  involving  parts  from  Aircraft  Battle  Damage  Repair  (ABDR) aircraft,  AF  Museum  Aircraft,  Maintenance  Training  Devices  (MTDs),  GITA,  TAA,  or DLADS will not be accomplished without authorization from the SPO.  (T-1). 11.13.8.4.1.  Parts  will  not  be  removed  from  static  display/AF  Museum  Aircraft except as authorized by AFI 84-103.  (T-1). 11.13.8.4.2.  If the part is approved for CANN, it must not be put into service until all necessary inspections (e.g., NDI, pressure  checks, operational  checks, TCTOs) have been  accomplished  using  specific  guidance  from  the  IM  to  ensure  proper serviceability.  (T-1). 11.13.8.5.  Units  will  not  CANN  parts  from  aircraft  possessed  by  AFMC  (B  or  D possession codes) without first obtaining approval from the applicable PM.  (T-1). 11.13.8.6.  An aircraft that has been extensively cannibalized will not be launched on an overseas  or  cross-country  sortie/mission  on  the  first  flight  following  CANN  rebuild without the owning MXG/CC approval.  (T-2). AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   183  11.14.  Hangar Queen Aircraft. 11.14.1.  General. The objective of this program is to ensure the entire fleet remains healthy and  all  possible  management  actions  are  carried  out  to  ensure  aircraft  do  not  remain inoperative  for  extended  periods.    MAJCOMs  will  establish  a  Hangar  Queen  Management Program. 11.14.2.  Definitions.  A “Hangar Queen” is a unit-possessed aircraft that has not flown for at least 30 calendar days.  Aircraft are exempt from accruing Hangar Queen time for up to ten days  immediately  following  DFT/CFT  repair  or  maintenance;  however,  if  an  aircraft  is  not flown after the tenth day, the ten days are included in the total number of days since last fly date  to  determine  the  Hangar  Queen  category  computation.    Hangar  Queen  aircraft  will  be further defined by the following three categories: 11.14.2.1.  Category 1: Aircraft that have not flown for 30 to 59 calendar days.  (T-1). 11.14.2.2.  Category 2: Aircraft that have not flown for 60 to 89 calendar days.  (T-1). 11.14.2.3.  Category 3: Aircraft that have not flown for 90 or more calendar days.  (T-1). 11.14.3.  All aircraft placed on higher HHQ alert status are exempt from  the Hangar Queen Management Program and reporting throughout the duration of alert status/posturing. 11.14.4.  An  aircraft  is  released  from  Hangar  Queen  status  after  the  first  flight.    The following examples are provided to clarify when an aircraft becomes a Hangar Queen: 11.14.4.1.  A  unit-possessed  aircraft  has  not  flown  for  20  calendar  days,  enters  depot status  for  5  more  calendar  days,  and  then  returns  to  unit  possession  on  the  26th  non-fly day; the unit has up to 10 calendar days to fly the aircraft to avoid Hangar Queen status.  If this aircraft does not fly on the 10th calendar day (35th non-fly day), the aircraft would become 36-day Category 1 Hangar Queen on the next day. 11.14.4.2.  A unit-possessed aircraft has not flown for 2 calendar days, then enters depot status for 1 calendar day and is returned to unit possession, the unit must fly the aircraft in the next 27 calendar days to avoid becoming a Category 1 Hangar Queen. 11.15.  Ground Instructional Trainer Aircraft (GITA).  Permanently assigned GITA are those aircraft  that  are  not  maintained  in  airworthy  condition.    Active  GITA  are  maintained  in system/subsystem  operational  condition  for  purposes  of  maintenance  training  and  normally carried  in  possession  codes  as  outlined  in  AFI  21-103  or  AFI  16-402.

These  aircraft  are  originally  Type  Certificated  (TC)  to  FAA  regulations/orders;  carry an  FAA  Standard  Airworthiness  Certificate  and  have  FAA-approved  aircraft  maintenance manuals.  All USAF-managed aircraft, and associated modifications, must meet the requirements of  AFI  62-601,  USAF  Airworthiness,  AFI  63-131,  Modification  Management,  and  AFI  63-101/20-101.   PMs are ultimately responsible for maintaining configuration control and ensuring flight  safety  of  systems  within  their  portfolio.    When  a  military  mission  is  compatible  with  a certified  civil  usage,  the  USAF  will  utilize  FAA-type  certified  CDA  to  the  maximum  extent practicable.    To  ensure  safety  and  support,  FAA-certificated  modifications  are  performed  on CDA.    For  maintenance  and  operations  of  CDA  the  AF  will  use  AF-managed  TOs  or  FAA-approved aircraft maintenance manuals and FAA regulations called out in 14 CFR Parts 43 and 91 as a guide. 12.2.  AF/A4L will: 12.2.1.  Coordinate relevant policies and procedures with SAF/AQ and the FAA. 12.3.  The Program Manager (PM) will: 12.3.1.  Be responsible for all elements of life cycle management IAW AFI 63-101/20-101. 12.3.2.

Introduction.  CRFs consolidate off-equipment intermediate-level, and in some instances, depot-level tasks for commodities such as aircraft engines, electronic warfare pods, avionics line replaceable  units,  wheel  and  tire  assemblies,  and  other  aircraft  components.  CRFs  focus  on efficiently  providing  maintenance,  repair,  and/or  overhaul  capabilities,  support  RN  efficiencies and  will  be  fully  integrated  into  the  Air  Force  Supply  Chain.  CRFs  are  considered  part  of  the repair  network  and  exist  to  ensure  responsiveness  to  MGN  requirements  to  sustain  operations both at home station and/or when deployed. Management and control procedures are outlined in AFI 20-117 and, when published, AFMAN 20-118. 13.2.  Organization.  CRFs will be established within existing maintenance organizations (EMS, CMS,  MXS),  minimizing  requirements  for  overhead  and  support.  (T-1).    Production  oversight and monitoring of repair operations is the responsibility of the owning maintenance organization in which the CRF is established. Commanders with CRFs will manage the personnel, facilities, and processes for the CRF following the policies and procedures in this AFI, AFI 20-117, and, when published, AFMAN 20-118.  (T-1). 13.3.  CRF Production  Requirements.  AFMC will provide CRF production goals through the supply  chain  manager/repair  network  manager.    CRF  production  requirements  will  be determined by capability and capacity (CAP 2) calculations IAW AFI 20-117. 13.4.  Maintenance Squadron (EMS, CMS, MXS) Operations Officer/MX SUPT will: 13.4.1.  Ensure  the  Node  Manager  (NM)  executes  enterprise  production  duties  as outlined  in  AFI  20-117  and,  when  published,  AFMAN  20-118.    (T-1).    Exception: AFSOC and ANG A4 manage CRF C-2 production requirements. 13.4.2.  Ensure  the  NM  identifies  and  up-channels  negative  trend  data  that  impacts CRF repair/RNI CAP2 to the MAJCOM and RNM.  (T-1). 13.4.3.  Provide  CRF  node  performance,  CAP2,  and  commodity  status  reports  and metrics as defined in AFI 20-117, and, when published, AFMAN 20-118.  (T-1). 13.4.4.  Ensure  the  NM  utilizes  the  information  management  systems  prescribed  in AFMAN  20-118  when  published  to  provide  timely  status  reports  and  receive workload requirements/ changes for commodity group repairs supported by the CRF.  (T-1). 13.4.5.  Identify  systemic  distribution,  transportation  and  supply  difficulties  and coordinate  with  base  LRS  leadership  and/or  upchannel  concerns  to  the  RNM  and MAJCOM CRF/Functional Manager for resolution.  (T-1). 13.4.6.  Follow  established  procedures  to  ensure  the  rapid  movement  of  retrograde and sustainment assets between CRF and MGN supported units IAW AFI 23-101. 13.5.  CRF  Enterprise  Information  Management.  Managers  require  accurate,  timely,  and enterprise repair data to make CRF command and control and production decisions.  To facilitate this requirement, NMs will utilize systems, processes, and business rules prescribed by AFMAN 20-118 to provide repair data and ensure enterprise visibility.  (T-1).   224  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 13.6.  Mission Generation Network Support.  Units supported by CRFs will maintain the level of  intermediate-level  repair  capability  necessary  to  sustain  MGN  operations.    MAJCOMs  must identify intermediate-level tasks and the resources required to perform MGN maintenance tasks for assigned weapon systems. 13.6.1.  Rotable  Pools.    Customer  Wait  Time  (CWT)  and  transportation  constraints  may drive the establishment of a Centralized Rotable Pool (CRP) for Class VII end items such as engines  and  pods  to  meet  established  weapons  system  availability  goals.  Use  of  a  rotable pool can enhance mission capability by placing serviceable assets closer to the user when the repair  capability  is  centralized  off  base.  Rotable  pool  size,  compared  to  support  unit  spare levels,  will  be  determined  during  deliberate  planning  between  the  appropriate  RNM,  and MAJCOMs. 13.6.2.  Cannibalization  at  supported  units.    When  commodity  LRU  local  retail  stocks  fall below mission requirements, retention of CRF-repaired end items as “CANN assets” may be necessary. However, this should be by  exception, and must be approved  by the  appropriate RNM  in  coordination  with  the  supporting  MAJCOM  CRF  Manager.    (T-2).  CRFs  will document  their  cannibalization  process  and  notify  supporting  unit  of  approval  to  retain CANN assets. (T-1). 13.7.  Documentation.  The  CRF  and  supported  units  will  maintain  all  required  status, inventory,  and  historical  record  documentation  on  CRF-repaired  assets,  IAW  TO  00-20-1,  AFI 21-103, and when published AFMAN 20-118 .  (T-1). 13.7.1.  Pod  asset  inventory,  status  and  reporting  requirements.  CRFs  and  supported  units will  update  RAMPOD  daily  in  accordance  with  AFI  21-103  to  include  Tracking  Control Numbers  (TCN)  and/or  commercial  carrier  name  if  applicable  as  well  as  shipment  date  of transitory assets.  (T-1). Shipping container status and locations are maintained in RAMPOD and  must  be  kept  current  by  the  organization  that  physically  possesses  custodial responsibility.  (T-1). 13.8.  Metrics.  CRFs  will  report  performance  against  metrics  IAW  AFMAN  20-118  when published.  (T-1). 13.9.  Agile  Combat  Support  (ACS).  AFI  10-401  covers  the  procedures  and  standards governing AEF/ACS, and other required support to Combatant Commands.  It also requires Air Staff  and  MFMs  to  publish  FAM  Guidance  governing  UTC  posturing  and  deployment  support strategies.    CRFs  support  intermediate  level  maintenance  requirements  for  in-garrison  and deployed operations IAW approved Air Staff/MAJCOM FAM Guidance. AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   225  Chapter 14 AIRCRAFT AND EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE CONTRACT SURVEILLANCE 14.1.

Training  requirements  are  specified  by  MP5301.602-2(d), ACO/Quality  Assurance  Program  Coordinators  (QAPC)  led  training,  and  MAJCOM  unique requirements.    FCs,  and  CORs  will  complete  all  training  requirements  within  90  days  of assignment.  (T-1). 14.3.1.  MAJCOM  Training.    MAJCOMs  may  determine  additional  initial  and  recurring COR training requirements as needed to ensure CORs remain technically competent on new or changed contract surveillance tasks, requirements, or concepts, along with updated FAR, DFARS, AFFARS, and MAJCOM policies related to contract oversight. 14.3.2.  CORs requiring special certification will comply with the requirements in Table 11.1 of this instruction.  (T-1). 14.3.3.  CORs  performing  surveillance  in  hazardous  areas  or  on  hazardous  tasks  where specific training/safety requirements are prescribed (e.g., fuels, munitions, egress, etc.), will be trained on all associated safety requirements prior to performing the surveillance.  (T-1). 14.4.  Quality  Assurance  Surveillance  Plan  (QASP).  The purpose of a QASP is to provide a planned  process  for  surveilling  the  performance-based  activity's  actual  performance  and comparing  that  performance  against  the  contractual  requirements  to  determine  conformity  with the technical requirements of the contract.  The QASP identifies what is going to be inspected, the  method  of  inspection,  and  the  frequency  of  inspection.    The  results  of  those  inspections become the basis for documenting performance-based activity performance. 14.4.1.  The QASP provides CORs with information to identify acceptable performance and potential  reasons  for  any  non-compliance.    The  QASP  should  be  a  “living”  document  (i.e., increase  or  decrease  surveillance  intensity  based  on  performance/confidence  in  the performance-based  activity)  and  revised  throughout  the  life  of  the  contract  as  performance warrants. 14.4.2.  Although  contractual  regulatory  requirements  provide  specific  items  to  be  included in a QASP, they do not provide guidance on format, surveillance requirements, or guidance on  QASP  development.  The  basic  format  of  an  aircraft  and  equipment  QASP  incorporates contractual regulatory requirements and unique aircraft and equipment requirements into the sections  of  Performance  Planning  &  Preparation,  Performance  Assessment  Surveillance, Performance  Results  Analysis  &  Reporting,  and  Performance  Follow-up.  In  addition, organizations  are  responsible  to  ensure  QASP  requirements  contained  in  FAR  Part  46, DFARS 246.4, AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program, and AFI 63-138 are integrated within the following sections (See Table 14.1). The Automated Requirements Roadmap Tool (ARRT)  can  be  used  to  prepare  the  QASP  (and  contract  documents)  for  all  performance-based at: http://sam.dau.mil/ARRTRegistration.aspx. services.  ARRT acquisitions for is available for download   230  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 14.4.3.  Documenting  and  reporting  involves  the  documentation  of  individual  inspections, monthly reporting of all scheduled inspections, documentation of performance-based activity non-conformance, and annual CPARS reporting. individual inspections.  TIs,  Program  Management  (PM) 14.4.3.1.  Documenting Inspections,  Customer  Comment  (CC)  Inspections,  “as  observed,”  and  Follow-up Inspections  are  documented  using  MAJCOM0-designated  and/or  QASP  required surveillance  forms.  CORs  are  required  to  document  discrepancies  as  soon  as  they  are discovered using the applicable form and will subsequently notify the performance-based activity as soon as the surveillance is completed.  (T-1). 14.4.4.  End  of  month  surveillance  summary.    The  COR  prepares  a  monthly  summary  to document  COR  surveillance  activities  at  the  end  of  each  month.    The  format  includes  SS items  inspected,  non-Service  Summary  (SS)  items,  CC  Inspections,  “as  observed” discrepancies,  along  with  any  submitted  CARs  and  the  status  of  all  outstanding  CARs  not closed  out.    The  content,  format,  and  routing  of  the  end  of  month  surveillance  summary  is determined by each MAJCOM. 14.4.5.  Corrective Action Request (CARs).  Once the end of month summary is completed, the  COR  drafts  a  1st  Notice,  2nd  Notice,  or  CAR,  as  determined  applicable,  for  each  SS  or non-SS item that does not meet the contractual standard.  The COR forwards the CAR to the FC/FD  for  review  and  the  PCO/ACO  for  evaluation  and  subsequent  issuance  to  the performance-based  activity.    CARs  require  the  performance-based  activity  to  identify  the nonconformity’s  root  cause,  a  reasonable  corrective  action,  and  a  “get-well”  date.  The PCO/ACO, in  consultation  with  the  FC/FD and  COR, then evaluate the  performance-based activity's response. 14.4.5.1.  If the performance-based activity’s actions cited in their CAR response fails to correct the area of non-conformance, the COR ensures initiation of another CAR for any subsequent surveillance rating periods in the same non-conforming area. The COR may continue to hold open a current CAR. The COR tracks and reports all newly issued CARs in the end of month surveillance summary. 14.4.5.2.  If any areas of non-conformance are not corrected, it is the responsibility of the FC/FD to contact the PCO/ACO or government program office to initiate discussion with corporate  headquarters  or  issue  a  cure  notice.  In  extreme  circumstances  a  show  cause notice or a contract termination notice may be required as determined by the FC/FD and PCO/ACO. 14.4.6.  Annual  Contractor  Performance  Assessment  Rating  System  (CPARS).  For performance-based  activities  without  a  program  management  function,  the  COR  in coordination with the FC/FD and PCO/ACO accomplish annual performance-based activity performance  reporting  using  the  CPARS.  CORs  use  information  from  the  end  of  month surveillance summary reports and CARs to complete the annual CPARS report. 14.5.  COR  Inspections.  Surveillance inspections  must  ensure  CORs  are  “sampling” performance-based  activity  services  and  not  acting,  or  giving  the  appearance  of  acting,  as  the performance-based  activity’s  quality  control.  Performance-Based  Service  Acquisition  (PBSA) principles denote COR sampling levels are at a much lower rate than the inspections levels of a performance-based activity quality system. AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   231  14.5.1.  CORs predominately use the periodic inspection concept described in the DOD COR Handbook.    However,  CORs  may  use  the  100  percent  inspection  concept  on  maintenance tasks that are critical or rarely performed. Since the FAR, DFARS, AFFARs, and contracting AFIs  are  silent  on  inspection  definitions  and  use  of  inspection  methodologies,  this  AFI prescribes  aircraft  and  equipment  COR  surveillance  be  accomplished  using  Technical Inspections,  Program  Management  Inspections,  Customer  Comments  Inspections  ,  “as observed” discrepancies, and Follow-up Inspections. 14.5.2.  Technical  Inspections  (TI).    Validating  technical  requirements  of  a  contract  are accomplished  by  performing  TIs.  Any  maintenance  task  accomplished  in  accordance  with technical guidance, (e.g., TO, work-card, OEM manual, etc.) qualifies for COR surveillance under  the  TI  concept.  TIs  may  be  performed  while  maintenance  is  being  performed  (In-progress  (IP)  inspection)  or  after  maintenance  is  completed  (equipment  condition  (EC) inspection and Quality Control (QC) evaluation inspection). 14.5.2.1.  In-progress  Inspection  (IP).    IP  inspections  consist  of  the  evaluation  of  the maintenance  task  items,  review  aircraft  and/or  equipment  forms,  validate  MIS documentation,  check  for  technical  data  usage  and  currency;  check  for  tool  usage  and care;  and  validate  after  maintenance  FO  checks  of  the  work  area  etc.  MAJCOMs  will determine minimum IP surveillance requirements/frequencies, and rating criteria. 14.5.2.2.  Equipment  Condition  (EC)  Inspections.    EC  inspections  consist  of  the evaluation of visually available inspection items, review aircraft and/or equipment forms, and MIS documentation applicable to the job being surveilled. MAJCOMs will determine minimum EC inspection surveillance requirements/frequencies, and rating criteria. 14.5.2.3.  Quality  Control  (QC)  Evaluation  Inspections.    QC  evaluation  inspections  are technical  inspections  that  are  accomplished  concurrently  with  the  performance-based activity’s  QC  to  verify  the  QCs  ability  to  readily  detect  technical  deficiencies  of  in-progress  work  and  equipment  condition.    MAJCOMs  will  determine  minimum  QC evaluation inspection surveillance requirements/frequencies, and rating criteria. 14.5.3.  Program  Management  (PM)  Inspections.    PM  inspections  are  similar  to  IG inspections where CORs assess performance-based activity work center’s ability to manage program areas they are contractually responsible for.  Minimum PM inspection surveillance requirements will be determined by each MAJCOM. 14.5.4.  Customer  Comment  (CC)  Inspections.    Oftentimes  Government  employees  are customers  of  performance-based  activity  provided  services.    As  such,  CC  inspections; although not a primary surveillance method, is a valuable surveillance tool in enabling CORs assess a performance-based activity’s performance.  MAJCOMs will determine the scope and applicability of CC inspections. 14.5.5.  “As Observed” discrepancies.  As-observed discrepancies are not inspections, rather they  are  discrepancies  “observed  by”  CORs  that  are  not  associated  with  a  scheduled inspection. Subsequently, they are not scheduled inspections and are not calculated into the monthly rating of any SS item. However, CORs must ensure all “as observed” discrepancies are  reported  in  the  end  of  month  summary.  Furthermore,  CORs  may  use  the  cumulative results of “as observed”  discrepancies towards CPAR ratings under the  “Quality” category.   232  AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015 MAJCOMs  will  determine  the  scope,  applicability,  and  documentation  procedures  of  “as observed” inspections. 14.5.6.  Follow-up  Inspections.    Follow-up  inspections  verify  the  performance  based activity’s  response/closure  of  a  CAR.  Specifically,  follow-up  inspections  ensure  the performance-based activity’s quality system has determined the root cause and implemented corrective  actions  to  eliminate  future  non-conformities.  The  COR  will  schedule  follow-up inspections as needed to determine the viability  of the performance-based activity’s quality system. 14.6.  Surveillance  Schedule.  The  COR  will  ensure  all  contract  requirements  are  surveilled  at least once annually.  (T-1).  Typically, this includes surveilling all SS items monthly along with non-SS SOW or PWS requirements. 14.6.1.  After  determining  annual  surveillance  requirements,  CORs  will  develop  a  monthly schedule of surveillance activities. The schedule must be completed prior to the beginning of the month it covers.  (T-1). 14.6.2.  The  FC/FD  will  review  and  sign  the  monthly  surveillance  schedule  and  ensure  the PCO/ACO is provided a copy before the start of the upcoming month’s surveillance.  (T-1). 14.6.2.1.  Changes  to  the  monthly  surveillance  schedule  within  the  month  being surveilled must first be coordinated and approved by the FC/FD and ACO.  (T-1). 14.6.2.2.  When approved, the COR must post changes to the schedule as they occur and send  copies  to  the  FC/FD  and  PCO/ACO.    (T-1).    Note:  MAJCOMs  may  approve surveillance  scheduling  on  a  quarterly  basis  for  organizations  with  unique/minimal surveillance requirements that do not warrant monthly scheduling. 14.6.3.  CORs  will  adjust  surveillance  activities  commensurate  with  performance-based activity’s  performance  and  level  of  risk  to  the  Government  should  the  performance-based activity not perform in an acceptable manner.  (T-1). 14.6.3.1.  If  a  particular  function  of  the  performance-based  activity’s  performance  has  a continuing record of acceptable performance in an area not likely to result in loss of life to AF personnel or damage to government property, surveillance of that function should be reduced. 14.6.3.2.  Conversely, surveillance of that function should increase if performance-based activity performance of a function is less than satisfactory. However, any increase should be  temporary  and  only  accomplished  to  determine  if  the  substandard  performance  is  a statistical anomaly or an actual contractual non-conformity. 14.6.4.  If minimum monthly surveillance requirements cannot be met due to equipment non-availability or special circumstances, an explanation in the end of month summary for each missed scheduled area and/or inspection category is required. AFI21-101  21 MAY 2015   233  Table 14.1.
