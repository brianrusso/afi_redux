Purpose. This instruction establishes procedures governing the authority and administration of theUSAF Personnel Parachute Program (PPP), parachute qualifications and requirements, and proceduresapplicable to premeditated personnel parachuting. 1.2.  Objectives. The requirement for the USAF PPP originates with DoD Directive 5100.1. The directivetasks the Department of the Air Force with “preparation of the air and space forces necessary for the effec-tive prosecution of war and military operations short of war” and identifies Air Force functions. A pri-mary function of the Air Force is “to develop, in coordination with the other services, doctrines,procedures, and equipment employed by Air Force forces in airborne operations.” The Army coordinatesand develops airborne doctrine, procedures, and equipment on behalf of itself and the Marine Corps.While this instruction draws extensively upon the combat, operational, and training base of the joint ser-vices, the nature of USAF parachuting also requires tactics, techniques, procedures, and equipment notaddressed in sister service publications. Objectives for the USAF PPP are divided into operational, func-tional, and management categories. 1.2.1.  The operational objective of the USAF PPP is to tactically employ forces during war and mili-tary operations short of war. 1.2.2.  The following are functional objectives of the USAF PPP: 1.2.2.1.  Test, evaluate, and certify systems and equipment that contribute to improved survivabil-ity during either premeditated or emergency parachute egress. 1.2.2.2.  Instruct and demonstrate proper premeditated and emergency egress procedures toimprove survivability, develop confidence, and establish an airmanship foundation. 1.2.2.3.  Conduct aviation support to public and/or military events to showcase military prepared-ness, demonstrate capabilities, promote good community and international relations, supportUSAF recruiting and retention efforts, and render military honors in accordance with AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures. 1.2.3.  Management objectives of the USAF PPP include: 1.2.3.1.  Provide standards for training, qualification, and currency of USAF parachutists. 1.2.3.2.  Approve parachuting equipment and maintain a central equipment listing. 1.2.3.3.  Increase mission effectiveness and safety. 1.2.3.4.  Ensure compliance with DoD and USAF activity, mishap, incident, and malfunctionreporting requirements. 8AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 20081.3.  General. Compliance with this instruction requires mature risk evaluation and mitigation by subor-dinate organizations. Use AFTTP(I) 3-2.34, Risk Management, and AFI 90-901, Operational Risk Man-agement, as guidance for the risk management processes. 1.3.1.  The USAF PPP does not govern cargo equipment parachute operations, cargo equipment para-chute rigging, or non-premeditated parachute equipment, including emergency bail out parachutesand ejection seats. Emergency parachutes are covered by the appropriate technical order or manual.Joint airdrop equipment procedures are prescribed by AFJI 13-210(I), Joint Airdrop InspectionRecords, Malfunction/Incident Investigations, and Activity Reporting. For information on drop zones,refer to AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations. 1.3.2.  The term major military command (MMC) is used throughout this publication as an umbrellaterm for the Air National Guard, field operating agencies, HQ USAF direct reporting units, and majorcommands to include Air Force Reserve Command. The Office of Personnel Management (HumanResources Collection Directive-5) defines a MMC as a military organization next below the Depart-ments of the Army, Air Force, or Navy and headed by a flag or general officer who reports directly tothe agency headquarters. For purposes of simplicity and applicability, this instruction categorizes theANG and those FOAs and DRUs not headed by general officers as MMCs. 1.3.3.  All USAF parachuting operations will be conducted in accordance with published guidance,utilizing equipment approved through the process described in Chapter 4. 1.4.  References. During  unilateral  operations,  use  this  instruction  in  conjunction  withAFMAN11-420(I)/FM 3-21.220, Static Line Parachuting Techniques and Training, AFMAN 11-411(I)/FM 3-05.211, Special Forces Military Free-Fall Operations, AFTTP 3-1.8, Tactical Employment—GUARDIAN ANGEL and Special Tactics Forces, and AFTTP 3-3.8, Combat Fundamentals—GUARD-IAN ANGEL and Special Tactics Forces (throughout this instruction AFTTPs 3-1.8 and 3-3.8 are notapplicable for other than GUARDIAN ANGEL and Special Tactics personnel). These publications consti-tute the primary guidance for static-line and military free fall parachuting. During parachute operationsconducted under a joint commander, use this instruction in conjunction with applicable joint publicationssuch as USSOCOM Manual 350-3, Training Airborne Operations (Parachuting). Additional parachutingreferences can be found at Attachment 1 and on the Air Force portal in the “AF Personnel Parachute Pro-gram” community of practice: https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Fil-ter=OO-TO-00-32. 1.5.  Waiver Authority. HQ USAF/A3O-AS is the waiver authority for this instruction, unless specifi-cally noted in this paragraph or in the text of this instruction. HQ USAF waivers are valid for only theperiod of time required to correct the waiver condition, not to exceed 24 months from the date ofapproval. MMC commanders have authority and responsibility for parachuting operations under theircontrol. During combat operations, contingencies, and inspections, waiver authority for operational pro-cedures specified in this instruction and associated inter-service references is the Air Component A3, theJoint Special Operations Task Force J3, the MMC/A3, or their designated representatives, as applicable.Waiver authority for operational procedures during exercises and training is the MMC/A3, or designatedrepresentative, except where specifically identified in this instruction. Approved waivers constitute autho-rization to deviate from specific provisions within this instruction.

Authority. This instruction provides USAF guidance for compliance with the legislative and depart-mental directives that govern parachute operations. It directs USAF PPP administration, characterizesin-flight duties performed by parachutists, and cooperates with the references listed in paragraph 1.4. toassure the legality, safety, and effectiveness of mission segments that involve premeditated personnelparachuting. 3.2.  Applicable to Whom. This instruction applies to all active duty Air Force, AF Reserve, ANG, andDepartment of the Air Force civilian personnel involved in deliberate personnel parachute missions, train-ing, support, or administration. Contract employees are required to comply with the provisions of theircontracts. When the government requires that contractors comply with this instruction, cite applicableportions in the statement of work. 3.3.  Validating Permanent Parachute Positions. A parachute position is a designated unit manningdocument (UMD) or joint manning document (JMD) position that has been approved by HQ USAF andthat requires the member to perform deliberate, regular, and recurring parachute duty as a part of the orga-nization’s mission. These billets are typically referred to as J coded positions. Since positions are vali-dated on the basis of recurring requirements, the intent of a J coded position is that the member willmaintain standards, qualification, and currency. Failure to maintain active parachute status typically pre-cludes service in the position. 3.3.1.  Requests for parachute positions consist of the following: 3.3.1.1.  AF Form 4322, Active Parachutist Justification. The justification must be consistent withthe PPP objectives in paragraph 1.2. and specifically address each position’s operational require-ment and impact on the organization’s ability to prosecute its mission. The MMC, in exercising itsrequirement vetting function, will consider factors such as SOPs, TTPs, equipment, training, med-ical support, flying hours, and funding. Prior to submitting requests, MMCs and subordinate orga-nizations should also consider the opportunity cost of coding a position (e.g. what the positionwon’t be able to accomplish in light of the new parachute qualification, training, and currencyrequirements). 3.3.1.2.  Request Letter. Include a request for parachute position validation from the MMC/A3 toHQ USAF. Requests concerning USAF positions at joint organizations should substitute theMMC/A3 for the joint command’s operations officer, even if this is not a USAF officer. WhileMMC functional area managers and PPPMs are typically involved in requests, internal coordina-tion and request format are at the requesting organization’s discretion. Where appropriate, MMC/A3s and joint command operations officers may delegate release authority for requests concerningbillets at O-5 grades and below to the first O-6 in the MMC PPPM’s chain of command or the AirForce Element Commander at the joint organization, respectively. 3.3.2.  Forward parachute position requests to the USAF PPPM electronically at a3o.as.work-flow@pentagon.af.mil or to HQ USAF/A3O-AS, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC20330-1480. The USAF PPPM will accomplish coordination at HQ USAF on behalf of the MMC. AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 2008173.3.2.1.  For requests concerning billets at grade O-6 or below, the USAF PPPM will coordinaterequests with the affected AF CFM(s), HQ USAF/A3O-AT, and HQ USAF/A1M when appropri-ate. AF CFMs generally consider factors pertaining to how the permanent billet will fit into thecareer field plan as a whole, the pool of available volunteers for parachute duty, modifications totraining quotas, and operational integration. HQ USAF/A3O-AT will review for fiscal support-ability, and HQ USAF/A3O-AS accomplishes requirement vetting and serves as the approvalauthority for position validation. 3.3.2.2.  The Chief of Staff designates general officer parachute positions in the same fashion thatapplies to other flying positions. The USAF PPPM will coordinate requests or revisions to generalofficer parachute positions with AF/DPG, AF/A3/5, AF/A1, HAF/CX, AF/CVA, and AF/CV. AF/CC is the approval authority in these cases. 3.3.3.  MMCs and comparable organizations will maintain approved parachute position validationpackages on file for accountability and to facilitate periodic review of authorizations by HQ USAF/A3O-AS. The USAF PPPM typically conducts this review every two years. 3.3.4.  The UMD or JMD reflects the number of members authorized parachute duty in a given orga-nization, by making reference to either a J coded position or a jump-inherent specialty. Double billet-ing will only occur when assigned to a valid student authorization or approved by HQ USAF IAWAFI 11-402. Forward double billeting requests to the USAF PPPM according to paragraphs 3.3.1. and3.3.2. 3.4.  Validating Permanent Parachute Positions Using Jump-Inherent Duty AFSCs. Certain  DutyAFSCs (DAFSCs) require the performance of deliberate, regular, and recurring parachute duty to accom-plish assigned missions. These DAFSCs are central to the ability of the USAF PPP to carry out itsassigned functions, and they provide a pool of qualified and current mission parachutists independent ofthe manpower positions in which they serve. In these cases, parachute duty is considered to be inherent tothe DAFSC, and since positions are validated on the basis of recurring requirements, the intent of a Jinherent position is that the member will maintain standards, qualification, and currency. Legitimate pos-session of a jump-inherent DAFSC constitutes a valid parachute position and exempts its holder from theprocess described in paragraph 3.3. 3.4.1.  Certain specialties require continuous parachute duty to accomplish the USAF PPP’s opera-tional objective and to maintain award of the DAFSC. The following specialties are jump-inherent:13DXX, 1C2XX, 1T2XX, and 1W0X1C (including AFSC transition to 1W0X2). 3.4.2.  Permanent disqualification from parachute duty precludes service in a jump-inherent DAFSC.Exceptions to policy are authorized by HQ USAF/A3O. 3.4.3.  The exemption from position validation for jump-inherent DAFSCs does not extend beyondthe DAFSC (i.e. secondary AFSC, tertiary AFSC, etc.). 3.4.4.  While 1T0XX is not considered a J inherent DAFSC, members who hold the 1T0XX DAFSCrequire qualification to accomplish assigned USAF PPP objectives and are authorized to attend quali-fication training independent of the positions in which they currently serve. Members maintain activeparachutist status, including currency, only when assigned to J coded positions or temporary para-chute positions per paragraphs 3.3. and 3.5. The 1T0XX specialty is exempt from the requirementscontained in paragraph 3.5.2. 18AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 20083.5.  Temporary Parachute Positions. Temporary parachute positions allow commanders to place qual-ified members on active parachute status in the absence of validated parachute positions. They are used topermit MMCs to respond to short-duration mission requirements or to allow members of jump-inherentcareer fields who are temporarily serving in other DAFSCs to maintain proficiency when serving outsideof parachute positions. Approved temporary positions convey active status and parachute pay entitlement.MMC/A3s may approve temporary positions amounting to 365 days or less (12 or less months parachutepay) in a 24-month period. Requests concerning USAF positions at joint organizations should substitutethe MMC/A3 for the joint command’s operations officer, even if this is not a USAF officer. The followingrequirements apply to temporary parachute positions: 3.5.1.  Members filling temporary parachute positions are qualified and maintain currency IAWPART 2. 3.5.2.  Members must have completed at least 30 months on active parachute status to be eligible fortemporary parachute positions. 3.5.3.  Before permitting members to participate in temporary parachuting, MMC/A3s, or joint equiv-alents, will evaluate the following: 3.5.3.1.  Interest of the service compared to that of the member. 3.5.3.2.  Impact on operational resources. 3.5.3.3.  Cost and impact on logistics. 3.5.3.4.  Likelihood that the member will return to a permanent parachute position. 3.5.3.5.  Costs of retraining. 3.5.3.6.  Availability of a communication process for parachuting and safety information. 3.5.4.  Temporary parachute positions are subject to considerable scrutiny. Requests for temporaryparachute positions within the approval authority of the MMC/A3, or joint equivalent, follow the pro-cedure in paragraph 3.3.1. except they must also include a copy of applicable qualification course cer-tificates and a copy of the member’s current ARMS Individual Data Summary (IDS) and JumpHistory Report (JHR). A sample request letter can be found at Attachment 3. MMCs must coordinateparachute pay funding approval through HQ USAF/A3O-AT and forward a copy of the approved doc-umentation to the USAF PPPM electronically at a3o.as.workflow@pentagon.af.mil or to HQUSAF/A3O-AS, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1480. MMCs will maintain a copyof the approved package on file. Requests that affect general officers must be coordinated through HQUSAF/DPG. 3.5.5.  For requests outside the approval authority of the MMC/A3, or joint equivalent, (i.e. those formore than 365 days in a 24-month period) staff the package to HQ USAF using the procedure in para-graph 3.3.2. The package consists of the documentation in paragraphs 3.3.1. and 3.5.4. 3.6.  Placing Members on Active Parachute Status. Initiate aeronautical orders (AOs) IAW AFI11-401 to place an individual on active parachute status only when required to fill a valid parachute posi-tion as defined in paragraphs 3.3. and 3.4. above, when in initial training leading to such a position, forstudent authorizations at USAF Academy parachute programs, or when filling an approved temporaryparachute position according to paragraph 3.5. Do not assign members to active parachute status unless amember meets the standards and qualification criteria in Chapter 6 or is in initial training leading to thatAFI11-410   4 AUGUST 200819qualification. Parachutist qualifications and status are awarded based on mission requirements and willnot be used as part of an incentive or recognition program. Active parachute status is commonly referredto as jump status. 3.6.1.  The following authorities may enter or withdraw members from active parachute status: 3.6.1.1.  HQ USAF/A3O-AS. 3.6.1.2.  MMC commanders, A3s, or joint equivalents. 3.6.1.3.  Commanders of organizations with validated parachute positions on the UMD or JMD,through the HARM office responsible for maintaining jump records. 3.6.2.  Aviation Service Codes (ASCs) are used to indicate flying status and incentive pay entitlement.ASCs pertaining to parachuting are only authorized for members qualified per Chapter 6 who arerequired to fill validated parachute positions as defined in paragraphs 3.3. and 3.4., when in initialtraining leading to such positions as explained in AFI 11-401, or when filling approved temporaryparachute positions according to paragraph 3.5. Per public law, parachute duty pay is a component ofHDIP. It is calculated at one of two rates based on the category of active service: High Altitude LowOpening (HALO) or static-line (S/L). 3.7.  Documentation.  3.7.1.  USAF personnel must be on valid AOs authorizing active parachute status IAW AFIs 11-401,11-402, 11-421, and this instruction before engaging in military parachute operations, to include ini-tial parachutist training. 3.7.2.  Parachutists are subject to the provisions of AFIs 11-403 and 48-123V3. Document trainingand examinations on AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record, and AF Form 1042,Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty, respectively. Members may alsobe subject to more restrictive performance standards required by joint, MMC, and unit guidance. 3.7.3.  ARMS is the primary mechanism for documenting and maintaining parachute qualifications,ratings, activity, and currency data. Members are encouraged to maintain personal parachute records.Training and currency documentation is also subject to Career Field Education and Training Plans(CFETPs), MMC guidance, and joint publications. Notify the Host Aviation Resource Management(HARM) office of the member’s parachute duty requirement (HALO, S/L, or both) so accurate AOscan be published and the HDIP entitlement rate can be determined. Properly completed AOs,on-the-job training (OJT) records, and currency requirements constitute the commander’s designationfor parachute duty. The detailed contents of the Jump Record Folder (JRF) can be found in AFI11-421. The HARM office is the focal point for questions concerning entitlements and JRF contents.The individual JRF is the permanent repository for: AOs, Military Pay Orders (MPOs), data submittedthrough AF Forms 4323, ARMS Multi-Crew Jump Record, AF Forms 922, Individual Jump Record,AF Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew Qualification Worksheet, as well as source documenta-tion affecting a parachutist’s status and qualifications (AF Forms 702 and 1042, formal training certif-icates, etc.). Members submit AF Forms 4323 and 922 per Attachment 2. ARMS is capable ofgenerating the IDS, JHR, and Individual Jump Record (IJR). The HARM office is responsible for val-idating HDIP entitlement and managing AOs, MPOs, and JRFs IAW AFIs 11-401, 11-402, 11-421,and this instruction. In the case of an AFI conflict, this instruction takes precedence for all para-chute-related issues. 20AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 20083.8.  Preparing Aeronautical Orders. For AOs that enter parachutists into active parachute status, sub-mit requests to the HARM office IAW AFIs 11-401, 11-402, and this instruction. 3.8.1.  Commanders must certify eligibility for parachute duty. Certification includes requirement foractive parachute status as described in paragraph 3.6. and review of past parachute duty or training topreclude performance issues and ensure member has not been previously disqualified. 3.8.2.  Requests include, at minimum, the member’s name, grade, social security number, unit ofassignment, DAFSC, UMD or JMD position number, date assigned to the unit, formal qualificationcertificate or letter of completion, expiration date of the current flying class III physical that clears themember for parachute duty, and type of parachute duty required (HALO, S/L, or both). 3.8.2.1.  For previously qualified parachutists, include the dates assigned to the authorized para-chute position. 3.8.2.2.  For members attending initial parachute training, include the class start date and location. 3.8.2.3.  For temporary parachute positions, include the effective duration and a copy of theapproval paperwork. 3.8.3.  Policy governing effective dates, durations, and procedures for AOs that authorize active para-chute status is contained in AFI 11-401. 3.8.4.  Commanders submit requests to publish parachute rating AOs to the HARM office IAW thisinstruction and AFI 11-402. 3.9.  Removing Members from Active Parachute Status. Officers vested with the ability to placemembers on active parachute status per paragraph 3.6. will remove members from active status when nolonger serving in a position approved through paragraphs 3.3., 3.4., or 3.5., when the requirement for thatposition no longer exists, upon completion of USAF Academy parachute programs, or when suspended ordisqualified for reasons listed in AFI 11-402 and this instruction. 3.9.1.  Notify the HARM office when a member changes parachute duty type (HALO, S/L, or both) oris removed from active parachute status entirely. Since termination of active parachute status results innon-eligibility for parachute duty pay, provide the member as much notice as possible. Parachutistssuspended or disqualified for cause do not require advance notification. 3.9.2.  Commanders may remove any parachutist from status for cause, for lack of qualification, or forfailure to meet standards per Chapter 6. Use the same reasons and procedures identified for aircrewmembers in AFI 11-402 to suspend and disqualify parachutists. 3.9.3.  Supersede AOs IAW AFI 11-401 and 11-402. 3.9.4.  Parachutists may be moved to inactive status for reasons articulated in AFI 11-401 (e.g. ASC9J when filling non-parachute positions or ASC 9L for non-parachute courses of instruction lasting180 days or longer). 3.10.  Permanent Disqualification Actions. Members are permanently disqualified when they fail tosatisfactorily perform parachute duty, when they voluntarily terminate parachute duty, or at the com-mander’s recommendation. Disqualification ASCs are governed by AFI 11-401. While final action ispending, a commander may suspend a parachutist for no more than 180 days after which MMC/A3approval is required; assign ASC 04 in these cases. Include a copy of the suspension AO with the com-AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 200821mander’s request for permanent disqualification. If not suspended, the member will continue to performparachute duties. 3.11.  Non-permanent Disqualification Actions. Disqualify parachutists in the same manner asnon-rated aircrew members and IAW AFI 11-402. Typical non-permanent actions include failure to main-tain medical fitness and humanitarian disqualifications. 3.12.  Parachute Duty Requalification. Parachutists who are disqualified for non-permanent reasonslisted in AFI 11-402 may be requalified upon removal of the impediment to parachuting. Approval isbased on the needs of the Air Force. If no longer assigned to a parachute position, the member must sub-mit a request according to AFI 36-2110, Assignments. Process requalification requests IAW AFI 11-402. 3.13.  Parachutist Code Identifiers. Assign the J prefix to a member’s AFSC upon completion of quali-fication requirements in Chapter 6. The J prefix is kept on the primary, secondary, or additional AFSC aslong as the member remains qualified, even though the requirement for parachute jump duties may end.When the parachutist also holds a C prefix (commander), a B prefix (operations officer), an aircrew X, K,or Q prefix, or other qualification/position prefix, place a statement on the AO indicating that the memberoccupies a J coded position. DAFSCs that are jump-inherent do not require a J prefix. 3.14.  Funding for Parachute Duty Pay. The Air Force programs and budgets based on validated para-chute positions. The total number of validated parachute positions determines the incentive pay alloca-tion. HQ USAF/A3O-AT is responsible for the flight/parachute pay budget and manages this programIAW AFI 11-402. HQ USAF will periodically revalidate parachute positions. 22AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 2008Chapter 4  ACQUISITION AND SUSTAINMENT 4.1.  Equipment Acquisition. This chapter constitutes the primary equipment acquisition and sustain-ment guidance for parachutists operating under the USAF PPP. During joint parachute operations con-ducted under a joint commander, comply with applicable guidance. 4.1.1.  Requirement Generation. Each MMC establishes operational requirements for parachute sys-tems and equipment in accordance with AFI 10-601, Capabilities Based Requirements Development,and applicable acquisition and test guidance as described in AFI 63-101, Operations of CapabilitiesBased Acquisition System, AFI 99-103, Capabilities Based Test and Evaluation, and DoD 5000-seriespublications. 4.1.2.  Requirement Configuration and Validation. When MMCs generate new category I/II require-ments (as defined in paragraph 4.4.), they must first validate the requirement through the USAFPPPM prior to government obligation to preclude dissipating personnel and financial resources onpre-decisional items. During this initial analysis the USAF PPPM determines whether a MMC’srequirement will meet the PPP Executive Committee or whether it will bypass the committee and pro-ceed directly to equipment test and evaluation as described in paragraph 4.2. When the USAF PPPMcoordinates a requirement through the committee, the purpose is typically to determine if the sameneed exists in other organizations, to ascertain the appropriate amount of USAF and/or sister servicestandardization, or to promote safety and affordability. When an urgent operational need exists for arequirement that would normally be coordinated through the committee, HQ USAF/A3O-AS mayconfigure and validate the requirement when convening the committee would unacceptably delayfielding. The composition of the committee is described in paragraph 2.2.7. When executing its con-figuration and validation functions, the committee will incorporate subject matter experts whenrequired, including parachutists, Aircrew Flight Equipment specialists, logistics managers, and supplytechnicians. Requirement configuration and validation will consider items that meet formal criteriadirected through Department of Transportation Technical Standard Order 23, the American NationalStandards Institute, a DoD operational test and evaluation process, or another DoD or serviceapproved process. Requirements not covered by a TO/TM may require special consideration prior tobeing fielded for use. Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions for category I/II requirements willbe considered, but may not be fielded until a minimum introductory period, consisting of active civiluse, has elapsed. COTS introductory period durations are typically 12 months, however the USAFPPPM may be more or less restrictive. The end result of the configuration and validation process is avalidated requirement that enters the testing, evaluation, and certification process. 4.1.3.  Acquisition Management. Unless equipment will be obtained through local purchase, as vali-dated by the USAF PPPM, the committee will request that SAF/AQ identify program managementresponsibility. The Program Manager will develop an acquisition strategy and coordinate fundingresponsibilities pertaining to multiple MMCs, if applicable. 4.2.  Equipment Test and Evaluation. AFMC is the USAF OPR for personnel parachute systems andequipment developmental test and evaluation (DT&E). Designated MMC operational test organizationsare responsible for operational test and evaluation (OT&E) of personnel parachute systems and equip-ment. AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 2008234.3.  Equipment Certification. The Test Parachutist Program (TPP) is the USAF OPR for the certifica-tion of personnel parachute systems and equipment. Send requests for TPP action through the MMCPPPM to 418 FLTS/DOOP at the Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards AFB, CA, DSN 525-4282. Cour-tesy copy the USAF PPPM at a3o.as.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. 4.3.1.  Items belonging to categories I and II, as detailed in paragraph 4.4., will undergo a designsafety assessment and test and evaluation, as appropriate. Replacement items will be reviewed by theTPP to assure they replicate the original item as it pertains to function and safety. After reviewing anitem, the TPP will forward all test results, design studies, documentation and a usage recommendationto the requesting MMC and to HQ USAF/A3O-AS. HQ USAF/A3O-AS will make a usage approvaldecision and authorize modification of the USAF Approved for Use List (AUL). 4.3.2.  Items belonging to category III, as described in paragraph 4.4., are part of a parachutist’s indi-vidual equipment for which operational needs will be the primary selection criteria. When an item willbe employed in an exposed configuration (i.e. could possibly interfere with the operation of the para-chute system) or could pose a safety hazard to parachutists, it must be certified by the TPP andapproved by the MMC on its category III AUL. In order to enhance safety, MMCs will prescribe itemjump configuration or mounting guidelines as required. Approval must be based upon sound, experi-enced judgment that the equipment both enhances mission performance and does not pose a safetyhazard to the parachutist. There is no requirement to list unexposed items that do not pose a safetyhazard on the AUL. 4.4.  Equipment Approval. Parachute systems and equipment are authorized via the USAF AUL, whichis approved by HQ USAF/A3O-AS and maintained on the Air Force portal in the AF Personnel ParachuteProgram community of practice: https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Fil-ter=OO-TO-00-32. Approval of items in category III is delegated to MMCs, thus the HQ USAF AULdoes not include category III items. Instead, MMCs are responsible for maintaining command category IIIlists and will post an updated copy in the AF Personnel Parachute Program community of practice. MMCsapprove category III items per paragraph 4.3.2. The AUL format is divided into three equipment catego-ries, and will include at a minimum: item description, NSN, part number, model number/manufacturer,and authorized users. 4.4.1.  Category I—parachutist aircrew flight equipment that is worn by, or otherwise attached to theparachutist. Category I includes parachute canopies, parachute components, harnesses, containers,oxygen breathing equipment, helmets, automatic activation devices/electronic automatic activationdevices, and altimeters. 4.4.2.  Category II—non-aircrew flight equipment that is potentially hazardous to the parachutist. Cat-egory II includes items such as life vests/preservers, equipment, equipment components, equipmentbags, strobe lights, and public relations devices used during parachuting demonstrations. 4.4.3.  Category III—non-aircrew flight equipment (individual equipment) typically worn exposed orused in premeditated parachuting which: 1) is available in a broad selection of acceptable options, 2)does not create a life-threatening hazard to a reasonably prudent parachutist, and 3) is carried byUSAF parachutists in support of a mission requirement. 4.5.  Equipment Sustainment. AFMC is responsible for serving as the single focal point for category I/II equipment sustainment and modernization efforts. The function will serve as the primary interface withparachute systems and equipment manufacturers and is responsible for the following functions: 24AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 20084.5.1.  Monitor the readiness and reliability of the existing parachute fleet through such mechanismsas periodic reevaluations and activity, incident, and malfunction reporting. 4.5.2.  Disseminate manufacturers’ safety notices and information bulletins in a timely fashion to HQUSAF/A3O-AS at a3o.as.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. HQ USAF/A3O-AS will promulgate perti-nent information to the USAF parachute community. 4.5.3.  Maintain close interaction with comparable sister service functions so as to benefit from likeefforts and disseminate pertinent findings. 4.5.4.  Maintain close ties with the acquisition manager, if this is a separate function. AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 200825Chapter 5  ACTIVITY, MISHAP, INCIDENT, AND MALFUNCTION REPORTING 5.1.  DoD Reporting Requirements. Ensuring compliance with DoD activity, incident, and malfunctionreporting is a management objective of the USAF PPP. AFJI 13-210(I), Joint Airdrop Inspection Records,Malfunction/Incident Investigations, and Activity Reporting, prescribes policy and identifies proceduresand forms used in preparing joint airdrop inspection records, airdrop malfunction investigations, and air-drop activity reports. All USAF organizations conducting premeditated parachute operations must haveAFJI 13-210(I) on hand, and all malfunction officers and jumpmasters must be familiar with its contents.Where AFJI 13-210(I) and this instruction conflict, this instruction takes precedence. MMCs may supple-ment reporting requirements, provided they adhere to the provisions of this chapter fully. 5.2.  Activity Reporting. Activity reporting is a MMC responsibility. The HARM office can typicallyprovide the requisite data to populate DD Form 1748-3, Joint Monthly Airdrop Summary Report, includ-ing total number of jumps by canopy and aircraft type. MMCs will submit the previous month’s data toa3o.as.workflow@pentagon.af.mil no later than the fifth business day of the next month. HQ USAF/A3O-AS will consolidate data and send to US Army Quartermaster Center and School (USAQMC&S),Aerial Delivery and Field Services Department (ADFSD), Ft. Lee, VA at http://www.quartermas-ter.army.mil/adfsd/. 5.3.  Malfunction, Mishap, and Incident Reporting. Malfunction, mishap, and incident reporting is aunit-level responsibility, and timely reporting of parachute malfunctions and incidents is essential. A mal-function is defined as the failure of a parachute system or piece of equipment to function as it wasintended or designed regardless of whether the failure is attributed to mechanical or human error. A mis-hap is defined as an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage or injury. Mis-haps exceeding the minimum damage or injury thresholds in AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations andReports, require safety reports. Mishaps involving civil aircraft or FAA functions (such as Air TrafficControl) may require additional actions per AFI 91-206(I), Participation in a Military or Civil AircraftAccident Safety Investigation. Major mishaps, especially those involving destroyed aircraft or fatalities,may also require legal investigation and reporting per AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident Investigations.

Joint air-drop inspections, procedures, and records are covered in AFJI 13-210(I). 7.6.  MFF Parachute Packing Waivers. Qualified riggers are the only personnel authorized to inspect,maintain, and alter main and reserve canopies and to pack reserve canopies. Under certain circumstances,MMC/A3s, and A3s at 3 AF and 13 AF, may authorize parachutists to pack MFF main canopies. The fol-lowing minimum conditions are required: 7.6.1.  Units must have exhausted all reasonable means to have qualified USAF or sister service rig-gers conduct main canopy packing. 7.6.2.  If available, a qualified rigger will supervise main canopy packing by parachutists operatingunder a packing waiver. In the event that qualified riggers are not available, the unit commander mayappoint a current MFF JM who has been trained by a qualified rigger to supervise main canopy pack-ing. The optimal ratio is 6 or less packers per supervisor. 7.6.3.  Parachutists who will pack MFF main canopies must have been trained to pack through eithera qualification course listed in paragraph 6.6. or by a qualified rigger who has been trained on the par-ticular system to be packed. Recurring packing training must be conducted annually by a qualified rig-ger and documented in the member’s OJT records using AF Form 1098 or via other organizationalsystems as appropriate. 7.6.4.  When operating under an approved packing waiver, parachutists are not authorized to jumpmain canopies packed by other parachutists. AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 2008377.6.5.  A packing waiver given under paragraph 7.6. is valid for no more than 365 days. The intent isto allow mission execution during surge periods or geographically separate operations withoutdecreasing AFE section support to other host base activities. 7.7.  Advanced Parachute System Packing Requirements. While qualified riggers are the only person-nel authorized to inspect, maintain, and repair main and reserve canopies and to pack reserve canopies, apacking waiver is not required for parachutists to pack the main canopies of advanced parachute systems(APS) that they will jump personally. Instead, members must receive APS main canopy packing trainingfrom a qualified rigger who has been trained on the particular system to be packed. 7.7.1.  Recurring packing training must be conducted annually by a qualified rigger and documentedin the member’s OJT records using AF Form 1098 or via other organizational systems as appropriate. 7.7.2.  Parachutists are not authorized to jump main canopies packed by other parachutists. 7.7.3.  APS Rigger Qualification. As defined in paragraph 8.1.4. APS are ram air parachute systemsprimarily designed for the sport parachute market. As such, the qualifications of riggers, administra-tion of rigger checks, packing currency, and criteria for APS are governed by paragraph 7.4. In addi-tion to the provisions of paragraph 7.4., those riggers qualified (certificated and appropriatelytype-rated) instead through Federal Aviation Regulation Part 65 are authorized to inspect, maintain,repair, and pack APS using the guidance contained in both this instruction and FAR Part 105. Wherethe FAR and this instruction conflict, utilize the more stringent guidance (e.g. system-specific cur-rency, etc.). 38AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 2008PART 3  AIR FORCE PARACHUTING PROCEDURES Chapter 8  GENERAL RESTRICTIONS 8.1.  Equipment Restrictions.  8.1.1.  General Provisions. While performing official duty, and unless specifically noted below, mem-bers may only employ parachute systems and equipment approved for their unit’s use according toChapter 4. 8.1.1.1.  In accordance with AFI 23-111, Management of Government Property in Possession ofthe Air Force, property management responsibilities limit the use of government property to offi-cial purposes only. Government owned parachute equipment will not be used for personal and/oroff-duty activities, and AFI 23-111 specifies pecuniary liability for the loss, damage, or destruc-tion of property resulting from negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use. 8.1.1.2.  USAF parachutists will only jump parachute systems and equipment for which they havereceived system specific training. System specific training is conducted prior to the first jump andincludes, but is not limited to: canopy flight characteristics, harness/container configuration, andsatisfactory completion of emergency procedures, including hanging harness if available. OnlyJMs who have received training and jumped the intended system are authorized to conduct systemspecific training for other parachutists. 8.1.1.3.  USAF personnel will not use privately owned or leased parachute equipment during mil-itary parachute operations. 8.1.2.  Foreign Military Parachute Equipment. When the foreign commander of airborne forces con-curs, and when either the Air Component A3, the Joint Special Operations Task Force J3, the MMC/A3, or their designated representative agrees, USAF personnel who have received system specifictraining as defined in paragraph 8.1.1.2. may use foreign military parachute equipment when jumpingwith a foreign unit. The senior USAF JM must complete a comprehensive inspection of any foreignmilitary equipment prior to its use. Foreign military parachute equipment may or may not be on theAF approved for use list. 8.1.3.  Sister Service Parachute Equipment. Provided they have been trained by a JM as defined inparagraph 8.1.1.2., USAF parachutists conducting joint operations may employ sister service systemsand equipment approved for their unit’s use according to Chapter 4. In these cases members operateunder the direction of a joint commander, and no special permission is required for the equipmentusage. When USAF parachutists have been trained per paragraph 8.1.1.2., but will utilize sister ser-vice systems and equipment that have not been approved for their unit’s use according to Chapter 4,special permission is required. In this case, the unit commander, sister service unit commander, andsenior AF jumpmaster must approve use of the systems and equipment prior to the first jump. 8.1.4.  Advanced Parachute Systems. APS can be defined as those ram air systems (canopies, harness,container, and EAAD) that are generally not maintained IAW a TO/TM and are principally designedfor the sport parachuting market. APS are primarily intended for use by parachutists who possessAFI11-410   4 AUGUST 200839functional certifications, by members who are in training leading to functional certification, and bythe Air Force Parachute Team. Use of APS is limited to those parachutists with 50 or more jumps.Members employing APS will not exceed a 1:1 canopy loading ratio, where the first figure is the sus-pended weight and the second is the canopy square footage. The AF approved for use list is the autho-rizing document for APS employment. Parachutists must complete system specific training perparagraph 8.1.1.2., and unit commanders will designate by letter members authorized to utilize APS.Parachutes that support the USAF PPP operational objective of tactically employing forces duringwar and military operations short of war are considered mission parachute systems rather than APS,and these systems are employed IAW the applicable TO/TM or manufacturer’s instructions. 8.2.  Foreign Military Aircraft. When the foreign commander of airborne forces and the senior USAFjumpmaster concur, and when either the Air Component A3, the Joint Special Operations Task Force J3,the MMC/A3, or their designated representative agrees, USAF members on active parachute status mayuse foreign military aircraft as authorized jump platforms. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 8.3., theMMC contracting office is the approval authority for use of commercially licensed foreign aircraft. 8.3.  Private and Commercial Aircraft. When authorized by the unit commander, members on activeparachute status may perform parachute jumps IAW DoD Directive 4500.53, DoD Commercial AirTransportation Quality and Safety Review Program, and applicable Under Secretary of Defense forAcquisition, Technology, and Logistics memorandums. DoD approved, certificated carriers must be usedfor all interstate operations and for intrastate operations when reasonably priced and available. WhenDoD approved, certificated carriers are not reasonably priced and available, commercial operators may beused provided they are inspected IAW USD (AT&L) memorandum, Requirements for Airdrop Opera-tions, dated 31 January 2003. MMCs will schedule, inspect and approve contractors in accordance withDoD Directive 4500.53, including aircraft owned or leased by state and/or local governments. See https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/default.aspx?tab=12 for a listing of approved intrastate carriers. Units will coor-dinate with the host base contracting office to ensure compliance. 8.4.  Lift Tickets. Subject to paragraphs 8.1. and 8.3., unit commanders may authorize the purchase of lifttickets when civilian aircraft are required to conduct free fall parachute training. As the government isleasing a seat on the aircraft, and not necessarily reserving all available seats, it may not be possible torestrict these lifts to military personnel. Separate passes should be used to deconflict governmentemployed/contracted parachutists from other parachutists for liability purposes. When separate passes arenot feasible, exits made by government employed/contracted parachutists and other parachutists on thesame pass will be separated by at least five seconds. In these cases, government employed/contractedparachutists and other parachutists must maintain adequate separation during free fall and under canopy.The senior USAF JM is responsible for ensuring airspace deconfliction through such tools as exit order,spacing, pull altitudes, and canopy flight patterns. Drop zone requirements apply as defined in Chapter10 and AFI 13-217. 8.5.  Documenting Parachute Jumps. Only authorized parachute jumps may be entered onto AF Forms4323 or 922 per Attachment 2, entered in ARMS, and filed in the member’s JRF. Authorized jumps mayoccur under the operational or tactical control of a unilateral, joint, or coalition/multi-national force com-mander. Parachute jumps are considered authorized when the following conditions are met: 8.5.1.  The jump is made for official purposes. 40AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 20088.5.2.  The jump is made by members on active parachute status per paragraph 3.6. 8.5.3.  The jump is made using equipment in keeping with paragraph 8.1. 8.5.4.  The jump is made from DoD aircraft or those aircraft described in paragraphs 8.2., 8.3., and8.4. 8.6.  Foreign Military Parachutists. Foreign military parachutists participating in combined operations,combined training, joint airdrop/air-transportability training (JA/ATT), aerial events, exercises, andUS-run military parachute courses are authorized to conduct military jumps from aircraft owned, leased,or operated by the USAF. 8.6.1.  US Jump Host. The jump host is the US government organization that sponsors foreign militaryparachutists who are required to parachute from aircraft owned, leased, or operated by the USAF. TheUS jump host is typically a unit with a parachute mission, however other entities (such as the DefenseAttach Office, MMC staffs, or units having control of jump aircraft) may accomplish US jump hostduties where appropriate. The US jump host is responsible for: 8.6.1.1.  Ensuring foreign jumpers are physically, physiologically, professionally, and administra-tively qualified to perform the parachute operations in accordance with applicable foreign militarystandards. 8.6.1.2.  Ensuring foreign jumpers are authorized to perform the parachute operations by the for-eign commander of airborne forces. 8.6.1.3.  Gaining approval to conduct parachute operations according to paragraph 8.6.3. 8.6.1.4.  Informing the USAF flying unit of the participation of foreign military personnel. 8.6.1.5.  Ensuring that foreign military personnel receive system specific training per paragraph8.1.1.2. if they will utilize US systems or equipment. 8.6.2.  Language Requirements. To ensure that aircraft procedures, safety considerations, and jump-master instructions are fully understood, aircraft crewmembers and jumpmasters must be able to com-municate with the foreign jumpers. The approval authorities listed in paragraph 8.6.3. determine theirrequirements for communication and translators. 8.6.3.  Approval Authorities. MMC commanders, including Theater Special Operations Commandsand overseas Commanders of Air Force Forces (COMAFFORs) having operational control of jumpaircraft, have the authority to authorize foreign military members to conduct military parachute jumpsfrom aircraft owned, leased, or operated by the USAF. These commanders are authorized to delegateapproval authority within their respective commands. Additional detail on the transport of foreignmilitary personnel can be found in DoD Regulation 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, andAFI 11-401. 8.7.  Civilian Parachutists.  8.7.1.  DoD Civilian Employees. MMC/A3s may authorize DoD civilian employees to perform offi-cial parachute jumps from aircraft owned, leased or operated by the USAF. Requests concerningUSAF civilian positions at joint organizations should substitute the MMC/A3 for the joint command’soperations officer, even if this is not a USAF officer. Additionally, if the member’s position descrip-tion specifies parachute duty requirements, the member’s commander is the approval authority. DoDAFI11-410   4 AUGUST 200841civilians do not occupy centrally managed parachute positions or draw parachute duty pay and areexempt from the requirement to utilize ARMS for documentation purposes. Units with DoD civilianparachutists must develop other mechanisms for tracking qualifications and currency. 8.7.2.  US Citizens Not Employed by the DoD. The approval authority for US citizens not employedby the DoD to perform official parachute jumps from aircraft owned, leased or operated by the USAFis the MMC/A3. US citizens not covered by the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA) mustsign the hold harmless agreement contained in Attachment 4. US citizens who are not employed bythe DoD must be members of the United States Parachute Association, possess a D-license, and becertified for the skill being accomplished. At no time will the scope of operations exceed the parachut-ist’s certifications or guidelines, as they apply to the jumper. This paragraph also applies to personnelperforming government contracts since they are not considered DoD civilian employees by virtue oftheir contract and are generally not covered by FECA. When contractors must perform para-chute-related services, requisite qualifications should be delineated in the contract. When the govern-ment requires that contractors comply with other portions of this instruction, cite the applicablereferences in the statement of work. 8.7.3.  Foreign Citizens Not Employed by their Armed Forces. HQ USAF/A3O-A is the approvalauthority for requests to allow foreign civilians to fly aboard and jump from aircraft owned, leased, oroperated by the USAF IAW AFI 11-401. When authorized, these parachutists must sign the holdharmless agreement contained in Attachment 4. 8.8.  Crew Rest and Duty Limitations.  8.8.1.  AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, establishes crew rest criteria. Due to the unique nature ofground operations, parachutists are frequently unable to satisfy these provisions. When commandersare unable to comply with published crew rest guidance, they must determine the level of acceptablerisk to the force and make a judgment concerning mission accomplishment. 8.8.2.  Members will not perform parachute jumps: 8.8.2.1.  Within 12 hours after completing a hypobaric (altitude) chamber ride at or above 25,000feet MSL. 8.8.2.2.  Within 12 hours after consuming alcoholic beverages. 8.8.2.3.  Within 72 hours after donating blood. 8.8.3.  Refer to the Navy Dive Manual for criteria concerning flying and/or parachuting after diving orhyperbaric (recompression) chamber rides.

Static-Line Guidance. For S/L parachute operations conducted by USAF units, the proceduresdefined in AFMAN11-420(I)/FM 3-21.220, AFTTP 3-1.8, and AFTTP 3-3.8 are authoritative except asnoted below. During parachute operations conducted under a joint commander, use guidance dictated bythe joint organization. 9.2.  Exceptions to Published Static-Line Guidance. Due to the unique nature of USAF parachuting,the following exceptions are granted to organizations with parachute missions governed by this instruc-tion: 9.2.1.  USAF units are not required to use non-jumping safety personnel. The JM may designate air-crew members to act as safety personnel. Aircrew members performing safety duties will be thor-oughly briefed and trained in the handling and control of static-lines. 9.2.2.  USAF units are not required to designate a Departure Airfield Control Officer (DACO). Estab-lishing mechanisms for accountability and accomplishing other functions traditionally associated withthe DACO are unit responsibilities. 9.2.3.  USAF operations only require a single JM on the aircraft, and the JM may be the first parachut-ist to exit on a pass. When the JM will exit first, the aircrew and other parachutists must understandthe exit procedures (normally the GO command and a visual reference indicating it is safe to exit) andthe method used for aborting the exit. When an aborted exit leaves parachutists without a current JM,these parachutists must land with the aircraft. 9.2.4.  Sustained airborne training will be conducted in keeping with paragraph 7.2.1. 9.2.5.  Equipment for USAF parachute operations is authorized via the approved for use list IAWChapter 4. 9.2.6.  According to mission requirements, USAF JMs may have personnel don parachutes and equip-ment while in flight. 9.2.7.  Surface Wind Restrictions. During operational missions, the commander of the force to beinserted will weigh the risks to the force and mission and coordinate wind restrictions with the Air-borne Mission Commander. During exercises and training, use the surface wind criteria listed in AFI13-217. 9.3.  Static-Line Deployed Ram Air Parachutes. Hybrid parachute systems have the ability to deploythe main canopy via static-line or free fall activation. These systems are restricted to use by parachutistsqualified through paragraph 6.6. (USAF Basic Military Free Fall Parachutist Rating) who have receivedsystem specific training per paragraph 8.1.1.2. Consult the system specific TO/TM for instructions andrestrictions. Section 9B—Free Fall Parachute Procedures AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 2008439.4.  Free Fall Guidance. For free fall parachute operations conducted by USAF units, the proceduresdefined in AFMAN 11-411(I)/FM 3-05.211, AFTTP 3-1.8, and AFTTP 3-3.8 are authoritative except asnoted below. During parachute operations conducted under a joint commander, use guidance dictated bythe joint organization. 9.5.  Exceptions to Published Free Fall Guidance. In addition to the exceptions listed in paragraph 9.2.,and due to the unique nature of USAF parachuting, the following exceptions are granted to organizationswith parachute missions governed by this instruction: 9.5.1.  Exit and Parachute Activation Altitudes. Minimum altitudes indicated below are listed in eitherabove ground level (AGL) or above water level (AWL), as appropriate. 9.5.1.1.  Overland. For jumps made with mission parachute equipment (non-APS), the exit alti-tude will be no lower than 5000 feet with planned pull not lower than 3500 feet. Use the same alti-tudes for jumps made with the FF-2 system (set at 2500 feet). When using APS equipped with theelectronic automatic activation device, the exit altitude will be no lower than 3000 feet withplanned pull not lower than 2500 feet. 9.5.1.2.  Overwater. During overwater free fall operations using parachutes equipped with or with-out an electronic automatic activation device, the exit altitude will be no lower than 3000 feet withplanned pull not lower than 2500 feet. 9.5.2.  Altimeters. Each parachutist will wear an altimeter when conducting overland free fall opera-tions. If waterproof altimeters are available, they will be used for overwater free fall operations. At aminimum, water jumps will have one operational altimeter in the aircraft for parachutist use. Duringnight operations, altimeters will have either an integrated light or be configured with an additionallight source adequate to illuminate the face of the altimeter. 9.5.3.  Automatic Activation Device (AAD) and Electronic Automatic Activation Device (EAAD).Each parachutist who exits an aircraft in flight will be equipped with an armed and functional EAADor AAD. When waterproof EAADs are available, they will be used for overwater free fall operations.Inspection, calibration, arming, and documentation procedures for the EAAD or AAD are containedin applicable TOs/TMs and manufacturer’s instructions. 9.5.4.  Surface Wind Restrictions. During operational missions, the commander of the force to beinserted will weigh the risks to the force and mission and coordinate wind restrictions with the Air-borne Mission Commander. During exercises and training, use the surface wind criteria listed in AFI13-217. 9.5.5.  Free Fall Drop Zone Criteria. The JM will determine the minimum size DZ based on the num-ber of personnel to be dropped, jumper proficiency, and prevailing winds. For DZ criteria, see AFI13-217 and Chapter 10 of this instruction. During operational missions, the commander of the forceto be inserted will weigh the risks to the force and mission and coordinate DZ criteria with the Air-borne Mission Commander. 9.5.6.  Oxygen Requirements. Pre-breathing, physiology technician, and procedural requirements forMFF operations that require oxygen are prescribed in AFI 11-409. 9.5.7.  Contact Flying. Contact flying is defined as pre-meditated contact between jumpers during freefall. Personnel conducting contact flying will document progression in OJT records. 44AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 20089.5.8.  Canopy Relative Work. USAF parachutists will not engage in canopy relative work while onduty except for specifically authorized Air Force Parachute Team operations. Section 9C—Jumpmaster Duties 9.6.  General Requirement. The primary JM is responsible to the appropriate commander (i.e. GroundForce Commander, Mission Commander, Flight Commander, etc.) for the conduct of all phases of themission that pertain to the parachute operation. Proper planning and execution by the JM is a criticalaspect of tactically inserting parachute forces and supports the operational, functional, and managementobjectives of the USAF PPP. Each aircraft dropping parachutists will have a minimum of one JM,although two are preferable. During operations conducted by USAF units, the procedures defined inAFMAN11-420(I)/FM 3-21.220, AFMAN 11-411(I)/FM 3-05.211, AFTTP 3-1.8, and AFTTP 3-3.8 areauthoritative except as noted below. During parachute operations conducted under a joint commander, useguidance dictated by the joint organization. While unit operations sections and/or assistant JMs mayaccomplish many of the tasks in this section, the primary JM and the commander are ultimately responsi-ble. 9.7.  Employment Planning. When the commander determines that parachute employment is required,the JM is usually given responsibility for planning and executing the jump. 9.7.1.  Establishing mechanisms for accountability and accomplishing other functions traditionallyassociated with the DACO are unit responsibilities that may or may not be delegated to the JM. TheJM should be intimately familiar with the post-jump movement plan since it impacts the individualparachutist’s equipment requirements. 9.7.2.  A DZ survey or site evaluation must be conducted IAW AFI 13-217. For DZs at higher eleva-tions, anticipate an increased rate of descent. During combat operations or operations short of war forwhich it is not tactically feasible to conduct a survey, units assess intended landing areas through themost accurate means available. 9.7.3.  A weather evaluation must be made to determine current and forecasted drop conditions. Windcharacteristics are amongst the most important evaluation items. During operational missions, thecommander of the force to be inserted will weigh the risks to the force and mission and coordinatewind restrictions with the Airborne Mission Commander. Maximum allowable wind velocity dependson the experience and ability of the team, the equipment, the terrain, and urgency of the mission. Dur-ing exercises and training, use the surface wind criteria listed in AFI 13-217. 9.7.4.  The JM is responsible for the items in paragraph 2.12. and for ensuring that all parachutistsmeet currency, refresher training, and recurring training requirements in Chapter 7. At a minimum,the JM briefing during sustained airborne training consists of the mission purpose and type, equip-ment requirements, plan of action, special requirements, and safety considerations. 9.8.  Coordination.  9.8.1.  The JM coordinates support requirements to include transportation, DZ scheduling, groundparty availability, aircraft utilization, and equipment. 9.8.2.  The JM ensures that the DZC has a complete understanding of the operation, equipmentrequirements, number of personnel involved, and special requirements. AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 2008459.8.3.  The JM retains overall responsibility for the accuracy of mission parachutist data on the pas-senger manifest. 9.8.4.  The JM is ultimately responsible for briefing safety personnel, conducting a thorough inspec-tion of the airdrop aircraft, attending all required aircrew briefs, and determining the load and exitorder. 9.8.5.  The JM keeps parachutists informed of mission progress and changes. 9.8.6.  The JM is responsible for completing and certifying AF Forms 4323 and/or 922 as appropriateand IAW Attachment 2. 9.9.  Rigging and Inspecting Parachutists and Equipment.  9.9.1.  The JM ensures that the JM kit is prepared and available per unit SOPs. 9.9.2.  The JM is responsible for rigging door bundles and inspecting personnel parachutes and equip-ment. 9.9.3.  When only one JM is available, specifically trained and certified personnel may conduct a JMpersonnel inspection (JMPI) on the primary JM. These personnel will be selected based on experienceand recommendation from an OJT certifier and will receive JMPI training for systems which they willinspect. JMPI training will be conducted IAW the references in paragraph 9.6. and the plans or coursesof instruction in paragraphs 6.4.1., and 6.7.1. Document JMPI training in the member’s trainingrecords and via AF Form 797 for military personnel. 9.10.  Safety. The JM sees that safety standards are enforced and maintains control of parachutists in andaround aircraft. The JM also ensures all parachutists leave the aircraft properly configured and employauthorized techniques. Additional detail on JM actions in the unit area, at the departure airfield, and inflight are contained in the references in paragraph 9.6. 46AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 2008Chapter 10  DROP ZONE PROCEDURES 10.1.  Drop Zone Guidance. For parachute operations conducted by USAF units, the procedures definedin AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations, are authoritative. This chapter defines addi-tional requirements. During parachute operations conducted under a joint commander, use guidance dic-tated by the joint organization. Training jumps should closely duplicate conditions that could beencountered during operational missions, to include rough terrain, open sea, and unfamiliar or unim-proved areas. Care will be taken to ensure that all conditions, especially those that are safety-related areidentified to the JM and jumpers. 10.2.  Drop Zone Personnel Requirements. Drop zone personnel requirements are contained in AFI13-217. 10.3.  Medical Coverage. Medical coverage is required for all non-contingency personnel parachuteoperations. In the event of a medical emergency, medical personnel and equipment will be capable ofimmediate and appropriate intervention. Medical coverage should be co-located with the drop zone con-troller. In certain cases, emergency response capability elsewhere on the drop zone or at the edge of thedrop zone will suffice provided adequate communications exist between medical personnel and the dropzone controller. Medical coverage for USAF personnel parachuting operations consists of a minimum ofone appropriately equipped and current Emergency Medical Technician qualified at the basic level orhigher. 10.3.1.  Medical personnel must be equipped with functional emergency lifesaving and stabilizationequipment as well as the means to transport patients to definitive medical care. Appropriate equip-ment should include, but is not limited to: medical kit/rucksack, Kendrick Extrication Device (KED),medical anti-shock trousers, oxygen system (AVIOX does not support this requirement), spinal immo-bilization gear, and a litter suitable for medical evacuation (with flotation if required). Comparablecivilian rescue equipment is acceptable. 10.3.2.  The requirement for medical personnel is satisfied when two or more parachutists who meetthe requirements in paragraph 10.3. exit the aircraft as part of the first group on the first pass. In thiscase a transportation mechanism is still required, and the medical equipment in paragraph 10.3.1.should be collocated with the drop zone controller, the transportation mechanism, or otherwise imme-diately available. 10.4.  Intentional Water Operations. Support for intentional water operations will include a boat opera-tor and a qualified safety swimmer for every boat. Training requirements for parachutists participating inintentional water jumps are listed in paragraph 7.2.3. 10.4.1.  Safety swimmers must be capable of assisting parachutists who cannot maintain buoyancy,who are rendered unconscious, or who become fouled in their equipment or parachute system. Equip-ment and requisite qualifications for safety swimmers are described in AFMAN11-420(I)/FM3-21.220. Graduates of the following courses are qualified to perform as safety swimmers: any mili-tary diving course, Special Forces Water Infiltration Course, Navy Rescue Swimmer Course, MarineCorps Amphibious Reconnaissance Course, Coast Guard Aviation Survival Technician A-School,Army Class 1 advanced survival swimmer (ICW TC 21-21), Army Basic Scout Swimmer, USMCAFI11-410   4 AUGUST 200847Basic Scout Swimmer, USMC CWS1, Navy 1st class, American Red Cross life guard, or AmericanRed Cross open water rescue. Commanders may require that safety swimmers be qualified militarydivers when conditions warrant. 10.4.2.  Safety boat personnel must be trained and equipped to quickly locate and recover distressedpersonnel on the surface. Military or civilian training programs, including the USCG Boat OperatorsCourse, are acceptable. 10.4.3.  During USAF intentional water operations, one power driven recovery boat is required forevery three parachutists on a single pass IAW AFMAN11-420(I)/FM 3-21. When all parachutists willbe military divers, the minimum number of power driven recovery boats is one for every six parachut-ists on a single pass. Airdropped boats are not considered functional until completely operational, atwhich point they may be used for recovery operations. Planners should ensure that parachutists willnot exceed Coast Guard and manufacturer boat load limits, and water craft will not be smaller than aZodiac F-470. Safety boats must be appropriately equipped to support water recovery operations IAWAFMAN11-420(I)/FM 3-21. A working search light is required for night operations. 10.4.4.  Medical coverage must be in place prior to personnel airdrops. If medical personnel are not inthe same safety boat as the drop zone controller, communications must be assured. 48AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 2008Chapter 11  PARACHUTE RELATED AERIAL EVENTS Section 11A—The Air Force Parachute Team 11.1.  Charter. In keeping with USAF PPP objectives, the Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT) is charteredto conduct parachute related aviation support to public and/or military events, to support general USAFand jump-inherent specialty recruiting, and to instruct premeditated parachute procedures that improvesurvivability, develop confidence, and establish an airmanship foundation. The AFPT, popularly known asthe Wings of Blue, has showcased parachute capabilities during aerial events for public and military audi-ences since 1964. 11.2.  Administrative Guidance. All parachutists at the AFPT are subject to the procedures and docu-mentation requirements detailed in Chapter 3, as clarified in this paragraph. 11.2.1.  Parachute Positions. AFPT military staff parachutists occupy valid parachute positions and areeligible to draw parachute duty pay based on the same rules that apply to other USAF parachutists.Aviation cadets assigned to the AFPT support its charter and are required to be on active parachutestatus, however they are not eligible to draw parachute duty pay and are not assigned an ASC in con-junction with paragraph 3.6.2. As such, these parachutists occupy student authorizations rather thanparachute positions, which imply a budget obligation. 11.2.2.  Documentation. Aviation cadets who are both assigned to the AFPT and eligible for the basicparachutist rating are authorized to document parachute jumps in the ARMS operational or trainingdatabases in order to ensure compliance with standards, requisite qualifications, and currency. Mem-bers may not count parachute jumps made as an aviation cadet towards advanced ratings, unless thesejumps are made while enrolled in another program, such as those in paragraph 6.3.1. Members of theAFPT are not required to utilize AF Form 4323 as described in paragraph A2.1.1. and may insteaddocument individual parachute jumps using AF Form 922 as a primary source for updating ARMS. 11.3.  AFPT Procedures. While AFPT members qualified through paragraph 6.3.2. are not consideredMFF parachutists (unless also qualified through paragraph 6.6.), they are free fall/HALO parachutistssubject to the provisions in Section 9B and elsewhere in this instruction, as clarified in this paragraph. 11.3.1.  Certification. Apart from the qualification training prescribed in Section 6A, AFPT progres-sion and competencies (e.g. non-JM upgrade progression, certification to jump public relationsdevices, etc.) are considered functional certifications and are administered by the MMC in accordancewith paragraph 6.8. During parachute competitions where parachutists must perform aerial videogra-phy in accordance with competition rules, the AFPT’s parent MMC is the waiver authority for therestrictions contained in paragraph 8.4. concerning separation between government employed/con-tracted parachutists and other parachutists. 11.3.2.  Currency. In addition to the provisions in Chapter 7, in order to jumpmaster active AM-490students, a JM must have performed duties within the previous 365 days where parachutists actuallyexited the aircraft. Non-current JMs and parachutists will accomplish refresher training IAW MMCprocedures. AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 20084911.3.3.  Equipment. In accordance with paragraph 7.7.3. of this instruction, the AFPT is authorized tosatisfy its requirement for parachute rigging by employing senior or master riggers qualified throughFAR Part 65. Parachutists assigned to the AFPT are exempt from the 50 jump APS minimum and areauthorized to exceed the APS canopy loading ratio in paragraph 8.1.4. by up to and including 1.3:1,where the first figure is the suspended weight and the second is the canopy square footage. In thiscase, parachutists will follow a MMC approved transition plan. 11.3.4.  Exit and planned pull altitudes. The minimum planned pull altitude for AFPT parachutistsusing APS is 2500 feet AGL per paragraph 9.5.1.1., however AFPT members using APS may exit at2500 feet AGL (clear and pull). During parachute demonstrations and competitions, the drop zonecontrol officer may waive both the exit and the planned pull altitude to no lower than 2000 feet AGL(clear and pull). HQ USAF/A3O-AS will not waive planned exits or pull altitudes below 2000 feetAGL. 11.3.5.  Based on the nature of the aerial event mission, the AFPT is exempt from completing formaldrop zone surveys as required by AFI 13-217. The AFPT will adhere to MMC approved procedures tomitigate risk in this area. Section 11B—Aerial Events 11.4.  Aerial Event Guidance. A functional objective of the PPP is to provide parachute related aviationsupport to public and/or military events to showcase military preparedness, demonstrate capabilities, pro-mote good community and international relations, support USAF recruiting and retention efforts, and ren-der military honors. AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures, governs USAF participation inaerial events. Parachutists typically participate in two types of aerial events: static displays and aerialdemonstrations. Attachment 1 defines terms that pertain to aerial events. Forward requests for events thatinvolve USAF parachuting IAW AFI 11-209. Commanders of flying organizations are encouraged to pro-vide airlift support for parachute participation in aerial events. 11.4.1.  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Guidance. Parachutists participating in aerial eventsmust comply with applicable FAA guidance, including Federal Aviation Regulation Part 105, Order8440.5A, Order 8900.1, Advisory Circular 91-45C, Advisory Circular 105-2C. 11.4.2.  United States Parachute Association (USPA) Guidance. Parachutists participating in publicaerial events must comply with applicable USPA guidance contained in the Skydiver’s InformationManual. 11.4.3.  Parachute jumps made in direct support of other PPP objectives are not considered aerialevents. In these cases, it is a MMC responsibility to determine when FAA and USPA guidance apply. 11.4.4.  Unless specifically noted, guidance articulated elsewhere in this instruction is applicable topersonnel and aircraft participating in aerial events. The waiver authority is specified in paragraph 1.5. 11.5.  Capabilities Demonstrations or Capabilities Exercises (CAPEX). A CAPEX is a type of aerialdemonstration in which parachutists demonstrate operational equipment and TTPs common to the mili-tary capability being displayed. Parachutists are not authorized to jump flags, streamers, banners, smoke,or other public relations devices in conjunction with a CAPEX. MMC approved capability demonstra-tions using operational S/L and/or MFF parachute systems and TTPs may be conducted using personnelwho maintain qualifications and currency through PART 2. 50AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 200811.6.  Parachute Demonstrations. A parachute demonstration is a type of aerial demonstration con-ducted during public or military events principally for community and international relations,esprit-de-corps, or recruiting purposes. As they showcase precision parachuting, demonstrations requireplanning, detailed coordination, strict adherence to applicable guidance, routine practice, and an experi-enced team. 11.6.1.  Minimum Qualifications. Commanders will carefully select parachutists to participate in para-chute demonstrations based upon experience, maturity, and demonstrated capability. For demonstra-tions that call for free fall employment, parachutists must have a minimum of 100 ram air canopyjumps. Commanders will identify and certify members for participation in aerial events on AF Form797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS. 11.6.2.  Organizations that conduct parachute demonstrations are encouraged to utilize a narrator tohelp interpret the experience for the audience. Narration is a functional certification that should tieintroductory, historical, descriptive, and contingency scripts into USAF messages such as general orjump-inherent specialty recruiting. 11.6.3.  Parachutists who jump flags, streamers, banners, smoke, or other public relations devices willbe functionally certified for the task by their MMC. Such devices must not interfere with the safedeployment and operation of any parachute system. 11.6.4.  The use of APS for parachute demonstrations is limited to the AFPT. 11.6.5.  The conduct of canopy relative work (CRW) is limited to AFPT members only. AFPT mem-bers are functionally certified to conduct CRW by their parent MMC. 11.6.6.  As it relates to aerial events, the term parachute demonstration does not refer to the functionalPPP objective of instructing and demonstrating proper premeditated and emergency egress proceduresas a part of survival or parachute training programs. 11.7.  Parachute Competitions. Parachute competitions are a type of aerial demonstration, generallyconducted as a public event by an event organizer. 11.7.1.  Minimum Qualifications. The AFPT commander will carefully select parachutists to partici-pate in parachute competitions based upon experience, maturity, and demonstrated capability. Theminimum experience is normally dictated by competition category by the event organizer. Command-ers will identify and certify members for participation in aerial events on AF Form 797. 11.7.2.  The conduct of CRW is limited to AFPT members only. AFPT members are functionally cer-tified to conduct CRW by their parent MMC. Section 11C—Information Collection, Records, and Forms 11.8.

Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School USAQMC&S—US Army Quartermaster Center and School USPA—United States Parachute Association Terms Advanced Parachute System (APS)—those systems (canopies, harness, container, and EAAD) that aregenerally not maintained IAW a TO/TM and are principally designed for the sport parachuting market.APS are primarily intended for use by parachutists who possess functional certifications, by memberswho are in training leading to functional certification, and by the Air Force Parachute Team. Parachutesthat support the USAF PPP operational objective of tactically employing forces during war and militaryoperations short of war are considered mission parachute systems rather than APS. Aerial Demonstration—a subset of aviation support, includes virtually every type of aerial participationin public or military events. Aerial Event—synonymous with aviation support, comprises static display, flyover, aerial review, andaerial demonstration. Parachutists are principally involved in aerial demonstrations and static displays. AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 200857Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT)—the USAF parachute team, popularly known as the Wings of Blue.The AFPT has showcased parachute capabilities during aerial events for public and military audiencessince 1964. Capabilities Demonstration or Capabilities Exercise (CAPEX)—associated with either aircraft orparachutists demonstrating operational equipment and tactics, techniques, and procedures. A CAPEX is atype of aerial demonstration. Capability Development Document (CDD)—captures the information necessary to develop a proposedprogram, and outlines the affordability increment of capability for a spiral acquisition strategy. The CDDprovides the operational performance attributes and is updated for each increment so the values onlyapply to the increment considered. Combat Capability Document (CCD)—used to document deficiencies arising during combat or crisisoperations. It is used in the Rapid Response Process to accelerate the fielding of critical systems to meettheater-specific wartime needs. The CDD replaced the Combat Mission Needs Statement (C-MNS) and isdescribed in AFI 63-114, Rapid Response Process. Combined Operation—an operation conducted by forces of two or more allied nations. Drop Zone Controller (DZC)—a qualified individual in charge of a DZ operation who represents theappropriate commander per AFI 13-217. Free Fall Parachute—a parachute system in which the canopies are deployed by the parachutist duringfree fall descent. Incident—event that affected or could have affected safe operations or the successful completion of anyplanned airdrop but that did not result in reportable damage. Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)—makes a case for a capability to resolve a gap identified byJCIDS analysis. Defines gaps in terms of functional areas, relevant range of military operations, time,obstacles to overcome, and key attributes with appropriate measures of effectiveness, as well as proposesa recommended solution serving as the beginning for analysis of alternatives. Once approved, it is notnormally updated. Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS)—Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staffsystem for identifying, assessing, and prioritizing joint military capability needs. It implements acapabilities-based approach to better leverage the expertise in government agencies, industry, andacademia to identify improvements to existing capabilities, and to develop new warfighting capabilities.Parachute requirements are generally delegated to the lowest approval level in the process due to thecomparatively small force size and low monetary thresholds involved. Joint Operation—a general term to describe military actions conducted by joint forces or service forcesin relationships (i.e., supported, supporting, coordinating), which, of themselves, do not constitute jointforces. In this context, a joint operation is any operation conducted under the authority of a jointcommander. When a USAF commander is the supported commander, that commander may have thisinstruction govern employment of the joint force. Major Military Command (MMC)—an umbrella term for the Air National Guard, field operatingagencies, HQ USAF direct reporting units, and major commands to include Air Force Reserve Command.The Office of Personnel Management defines a MMC as a military organization next below theDepartments of the Army, Air Force, or Navy and headed by a flag or general officer who reports directly58AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 2008to the agency headquarters. For purposes of simplicity and applicability, this instruction categorizes theANG and those FOAs and DRUs not headed by general officers as MMCs. Malfunction—the failure of a parachute system or piece of equipment to function as it was intended ordesigned, regardless of whether the failure is attributed to mechanical or human error. Mean Effective Wind—a theoretical wind of constant velocity and direction, extending from the surfaceto a predetermined altitude above the ground. Military Event—an official DoD event conducted in support of an assigned mission, including purposesof esprit-de-corps, primarily for military or civil service personnel, dependents, and limited guests. Theevent must be hosted on a facility owned, leased, or operated by the DoD. Mishap—an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage or injury. Office ofPrimary Responsibility (OPR)—the originating office for a publication. The author of the publication isan individual within the office, in this case the USAF PPPM. Parachute Badge—a distinctive emblem worn on a member’s uniform that signifies attainment of aUSAF parachutist rating. Parachutist badges correspond to USAF parachutist ratings and are permanentunless specifically revoked. Parachute Rating—a classification that represents a member’s level of parachute experience. The USAFawards basic ratings by publishing an AO when a member meets the standards and qualificationrequirements in Chapter 6 and the requirements listed in AFI 11-402 pertaining to length of service andnumber and type of jumps. The USAF awards advanced ratings to members who attain specified levels ofexperience. Pass—an approach made over the DZ by an airdrop aircraft. Several groups or sticks of parachutists mayexit on a single pass. Point of Impact (PI)—the point on the drop zone where the first airdropped parachutist or equipmentload is expected to land when the exit is made at the release point. Public Event—community relations event not connected with the military functioning of the DoD andintended primarily for non-military audiences. Some examples include military open house events,ceremonies, exhibitions, expositions, athletic contests, fairs, parades, tattoos, airshows, internationalairshows and trade exhibitions, or similar programs. These events may be on or off-base, CONUS orOCONUS. Public events can be sponsored by either DoD or non-DoD organizations. Military exercises,movements, maneuvers, or operations are not considered to be public events merely on the basis of beingincidentally observed by the general public. Such events can be good community relations and recruitingopportunities. Release Point—the computed point where personnel or equipment should exit the aircraft to land on thetarget. Rigger—an individual qualified to inspect, pack, and repair parachutes. Static Display—a subset of aviation support, the ground display of personnel and equipment thatcomprise a military capability. Static-Line Parachute—a parachute system in which a line or strap is attached from the parachute to ananchor cable in the aircraft so that, when the jumper exits the aircraft, the parachute is deployedautomatically. AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 200859Student Authorization—a term used uniquely to define a position that requires parachuting at the USAFAcademy that is not subject to the validation process in paragraphs 3.3., 3.4., or 3.5. Personnel in studentauthorizations are typically cadets, but not universally (e.g. unassigned active duty personnel attendingAM-490). Student authorizations are used to place members on active parachute status for the purpose ofenrollment in AM-490, AM-491, AM-492, or AM-496. Personnel in student authorizations are notassigned an Aviation Service Code and are not authorized to draw parachute duty pay, however cadetsenrolled in AM-491 or higher-level programs are authorized to document parachute jumps in the ARMSoperational or training databases in order to ensure compliance with standards, requisite qualifications,and currency. AFPT military staff parachutists occupy valid parachute positions as opposed to studentauthorizations. Unilateral Operation—an operation conducted by a single service. In this context, any operationconducted under the authority of a USAF commander where joint participation is incidental to the overalloperation. 60AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 2008Attachment 2  AIR FORCE FORMS 4323 AND 922 A2.1.  Prescription. This instruction prescribes AF Form 4323, ARMS Multi-Crew Jump Record, and AFForm 922, Individual Jump Record, as source documents for recording and reporting operational or train-ing jump information for members authorized to take part in parachute operations. These forms constitutethe official record of individual jumps for USAF members and are used to substantiate parachute duty payeligibility for members IAW this instruction. A2.1.1.  AF Form 4323. AF Form 4323 is the primary mechanism for documenting individual para-chute jumps made by USAF members and the source document used to update ARMS. AF Form 4323replaced AF Form 922 as the primary documentation mechanism on July 1, 2003. A2.1.2.  AF Form 922. AF Form 922 is currently utilized to document individual parachute jumpsmade by USAF members with military agencies outside of the member’s unit of assignment or attach-ment. This form is an alternate method to record individual jump activity for a member who performsseveral missions, in different aircraft, for different days, and/or with non-USAF organizations. Inthese cases, AF Form 922 is used as a source document to update ARMS. A2.2.  Additional Form Responsibilities. AF Forms prescribed by this instruction are maintained IAWAFMAN 33-363. A2.2.1.  Jumpmaster. A2.2.1.1.  Prior to the jump, review GO/NO GO data for each parachutist (if not previouslyauthenticated by the organization’s ARM) to verify that members meet the standards and qualifi-cations in Section 6A and the currency requirements in Section 7A. A2.2.1.2.  Ensure the AF Form 4323 (or 922) is dated and properly completed to reflect all perti-nent jump types, conditions, and activities/duties for all personnel who are authorized to take partin the jump. Sign the form as the certifying official. A2.2.1.3.  Hand-carry the completed original form to the ARM so the data can be entered inARMS. Delays in submitting forms may result in parachute duty pay interruption. A2.2.2.  Aviation Resource Management Office. A2.2.2.1.  Ensure a responsible individual audits AF Forms 4323 and 922 for accuracy, enters thedata in ARMS, verifies the ARMS data using the daily jump activity summary or browser equiva-lent, and signs and dates the form before sending it to the HARM. Where local procedures estab-lish the HARM as the auditing agency, the HARM updates, signs, and dates the form. A2.2.2.2.  Maintain the original form in the HARM office that services the unit to which the mem-ber is assigned. A2.2.2.3.  Validate proficiency requirements for parachute duty pay purposes. A2.3.  Explanation of Codes. AF Forms 4323 and 922 utilize the following codes to represent pertinentjump types, conditions, and activities/duties: A2.3.1.  Type of Jump. AFI11-410   4 AUGUST 200861A2.3.1.1.  Administrative (A)—any non-tactical parachute jump accomplished only for profi-ciency or currency purposes. A2.3.1.2.
