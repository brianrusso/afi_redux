Career Field Team (CFT)— Functionally oriented teams that execute Force Development (FD) policy and programs for civilians. Competencies— Observable, measurable pattern of knowledge, skills,  abilities, behaviors, and other characteristics needed to perform institutional or occupational functions successfully. Continuum  of  Learning  (CoL)—  Career-long  process  of  individual  development  where challenging experiences are combined with education and training through a common taxonomy to  produce  Airmen  who  possess  the  tactical  expertise,  operational  competence,  and  strategic vision to lead and execute the full spectrum of Air Force missions. Continuum of Service (CoS)— A personnel management construct to support the efficient use of  human  capital  to  accommodate  varying  levels  of  individual  services  commensurate  with  a member’s ability to serve (part-time to full-time) to effectively meet AF requirements. Development  Team  (DT)—  Provides  oversight  of  officer,  civilian,  and  enlisted  personnel development  to  meet  both  functional  and  AF  corporate  leadership  requirements.    DTs  are  the conduit  between  force  development  systems,  frameworks,  and  policy  and  translate  these  into career vectors for individuals. Education— Process of imparting general bodies of knowledge and habits of mind applicable to a  broad  spectrum  of  endeavors  to  intellectually  prepare  individuals  to  deal  with  dynamic environments  and  solve  ill-defined  problems  by  using  critical  thought  and  reasoned  judgment.  Education  programs  prepare  Airmen  to  anticipate  and  successfully  meet  challenges  across  the   10  AFPD36-26  22 DECEMBER 2015 range of military operations and build a professional corps.  Further, they positively impact both recruitment and retention efforts. Enlisted  Development  Team—  Provides  key  input  on  functional  progression  and  succession planning.    They  execute  enlisted  vectoring  and  identify  key  leadership  and  developmental positions  in  their  functional  communities.

Force Development (FD)— A deliberate process of preparing Airmen through the CoL with the required  competencies  to  meet  the  challenges  of  current  and  future  operating  environments.  Institutional  development  generally  results  in  leadership,  management,  and  warrior  ethos proficiency.  Occupational development generally results in technical skill proficiency. Force  Development    Construct—  A  Framework  that  links  Airmen  development  needs  with defined  institutional  competencies.    These  competencies  (Organizational,  People/Team,  and Personal) are delivered through the CoL. Functional  Authority  (FA)—  Senior  leaders,  to  include  Assistant  Secretaries  (SES),  Deputy Chiefs of Staff (three-star), and other selected HAF two-letter GO/SES-level leaders that provide corporate perspective of institutional requirements and force management and development.  The FA  serves  as  a  final  authority  to  ensure  all  policies,  established  in  accordance  with  this document, are implemented within their functional community.  FAs are supported by FMs who are supported by CFMs. Functional  Management  Structure—  The  Functional  Authority,  Functional  Manager, Development Team, Enlisted Development Team, Career Field Manager, functional Assignment Team/Career Field Team and other career field stakeholders at the enterprise level who provide a corporate perspective of institutional requirements, career field-specific policy and guidance, and day-to-day  management  of  their  specific  career  field(s)  in  order  to  ensure  Airmen  within  their functional community are equipped, developed, and sustained to provide AF capabilities. Functional  Manager  (FM)— Senior leaders, designated by the appropriate  FAs, who provide day-to-day management responsibility over specific functional communities.  While they should maintain  an  institutional  focus  with  regard  to  resource  development  and  distribution,  FMs  are responsible for ensuring  their specialties are equipped, developed,  and sustained to  provide AF capabilities. Instructional  System  Development  (ISD)—  Systematic  process  that  guides  the  development, implementation, management, and evaluation of training programs. Institutional  Competencies  (ICs)—  Common  taxonomy  used  to  implement  the  CoL.    These leadership  competencies  are  expected  of  all  Airmen,  throughout  their  careers,  and  will  be  the competencies  needed  to  operate  successfully  in  the  constantly  changing  environment  in  which they  function.    The  three  categories  of  these  competencies  are  mapped  to  the  Air  Force leadership levels. AFPD36-26  22 DECEMBER 2015   11  New  Supervisors—  Civilian  and  military  Airmen  who  are  promoted  or  hired  into  supervisory positions and have no previous experience in the Air Force or in supervisory positions. Occupational  Competencies— A set of competencies required of all Airmen within a specific workforce  category  (a  group  of  functions  requiring  similar  work,  i.e.  Engineering).    They describe  technical/functional  skills,  knowledge,  abilities,  behaviors,  and  other  characteristics needed to perform that function’s mission successfully. Personnel  Life  Cycle—  All  actions  involved  in  the  management  and  development  of  the workforce to include Define, Acquire, Develop, Utilize, Sustain, and Transition. Professional Continuing Education (PCE)— Any course that is less than 20 weeks in duration and  satisfies  mission  accomplishment,  sustainment,  or  enhancement  as  required  by  law,  Air Force governance, specific memorandum of agreement, or position requirement.  PCE should not be  confused  with  initial  skills  and  subsequent  advanced  training  courses  that  are  required  to advance in the Air Force Specialty Code skill level. Professional Military Education (PME)— Critical subset of developmental education that: 1) provides the nation with personnel skilled in the employment of air, space, and cyberspace power in the conduct of war, small scale contingencies, deterrence, peacetime operations, and national security;  2)  provides  AF  personnel  with  the  skills  and  knowledge  to  make  sound  decisions  in progressively  more  demanding  leadership  positions  within  the  national  security  environment; and  3)  develops  strategic  thinkers,  planners,  and  war  fighters.    In  addition,  PME  programs strengthen the ability and skills of AF personnel to lead, manage, and supervise. Records  Disposition  Schedule  (RDS)—  Document  providing  mandatory  instruction  for  the lifecycle management of records (and non-record materials) in  any  format  or media type.   The RDS provides for the disposition of records when agency business need for the records ceases, i.e., destruction of temporary records and transfer of permanent records to the National Archives of the United States. Training— Set of events or activities presented in a structured or planned manner through one or  more  media  for  the  attainment  and  retention  of  skills,  knowledge,  and  attitudes  required  to meet  job  performance  requirements.    This  involves  the  coaching  and  mentoring  of  Airmen, resulting in proficiency development. Training System— Systematically developed curriculum including, but not necessarily limited to,  courseware,  classroom  aids,  training  simulators  and  devices,  operational  equipment, embedded  training  capability,  and  personnel  to  operate,  maintain,  or  employ  a  system.    The Training System includes all necessary elements of logistic support.    12  AFPD36-26  22 DECEMBER 2015 Attachment 2 INSTITUTIONAL COMPETENCY (IC) LIST A2.1.  Elements  of  the  Continuum  of  Learning  (CoL)  have  long  been  institutionalized  and  are providing  useful  and  important  contributions  to  the  development  of  Airmen.    The  ICs  are essential  to  operate  successfully  across  the  widest  array  of  Air  Force  tasks  and  requirements.  Various programs delivering the ICs will assist in the development of Airmen over the course of their careers. Figure A2.1.  Institutional Competency List.
