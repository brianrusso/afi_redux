VI defined by the Department of Defense (DoD).  VI is information in the form of visual or pictorial representation(s) of person(s), place(s), or thing(s), either with or without sound, and includes  still  and  motion  photography,  audio  video  recording,  graphic  arts,  and  visual presentations.  It is DoD policy that VI is  an essential information resource. VI aids operational planning and decision-making and is critical to effective and efficient training. VI is fundamental to  the  historical  and  evidentiary  record  of  DoD  activities  and  actions.  It  aids  the  DoD  Public Affairs (PA) community in providing information to the public concerning the DoD’s operations and  programs.  It  also  supports  DoD  business  operations  and  facilitates  other  critical  DoD functions. The DoD's Defense Media Activity (DMA) manages the DoD VI program through its Defense  Visual  Information  (DVI)  directorate.  DVI  is  responsible  for  policy  development, management, oversight, and proponency of DoD Visual  Information. DoD specifically requires VI as follows: 1.1.1.  VI  meeting  the  DoD’s  operational,  informational,  training,  PA,  research,  legal, historical documentation, business, and administrative needs shall be acquired or created, and preserved. 1.1.2.  Imagery  of  joint  interest  should  be  centrally  managed  and  provided  by  or  through central  DoD  information  systems.  Such  information  systems  shall  be  established  and operated  in  compliance  with  DoD  Instruction  (DoDI)  8320.02,  Sharing  Data,  Information, and Information Technology (IT) Services in the Department of Defense. DVI manages this function  through  its  Defense  Imagery  Management  Operations  Center  (DIMOC),  DoD’s central  VI  enterprise  level  activity  for  collection,  management,  storage,  and  distribution  of classified  and  unclassified  strategic,  operational,  tactical,  and  joint-interest  still  and  motion imagery, graphics products, VI end products and records. 1.1.3.  Imagery should be fully captioned, and assigned a DoD-standard identifying number IAW DoDI 5040.02. 1.1.4.  Controls  should  be  employed replicating, distributing, storing, or preserving VI of prioritized usefulness to the DoD. to  minimize  acquiring,  creating, transmitting, 1.1.5.  VI  with  historical  or  long-term  value  shall  be  stored,  managed,  and  preserved  in  a designated DoD VI records center. 1.1.6.  Organizational  elements  or functions  within  organizations  whose  principal responsibility is  to  provide VI products  and/or services shall be authorized and managed in accordance with DoDI 5040.02 and DoDI 5040.07, Visual Information (VI) Production. 1.1.7.  DoD VI shall be life cycle-managed according to  DoDI 5040.02 and DoDI 5040.07, Visual Information (VI) Production. 1.1.8.  Computers, ancillary equipment, software, and firmware employed in the acquisition, storage,  processing,  management,  movement,  control,  display,  switching,  interchange, transmission,  or  reception  of  DoD  imagery,  other  than  stand-alone,  self-contained,  or embedded information technology that is not and will not be connected to the DoD enterprise AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 7 network, are assets of the DoD Global Information Grid and, as such, shall comply with the provisions  of  DoD  Directive  (DoDD)  8000.1,  Management  of  the  Department  of  Defense Information Enterprise (DoD IE). 1.2.  DoD  VI  mission  mandates.  In  Accordance  With  (IAW)  DoDI  5040.02,  and  DoDI 5040.07, Visual Information (VI) Production the DoD mandates three main mission areas to each branch of service with regard to the VI mission: 1.2.1.  The  VI  mission  is  performed  at  every  DoD  installation.  All  VI  missions  must  be consolidated  on  each  installation  where  feasible,  with  effective  management  controls.  The organizations which perform the VI mission must be assigned a Defense Visual Information Activity  Number  ((DVIAN)  authorization  to  operate)  by  a  central  service-level  office  (see Chapter 3). 1.2.1.1.  VI  shall  be  viewed  and  used  as  an  essential  information  resource  and  a supporting  capability  for  strategic  communication.  VI  assists  the  greater  public  affairs community  in  providing  information  to  the  public  concerning  Air  Force  operations  and programs. 1.2.2.  Each  service  must  provide  trained  Combat  Camera  (COMCAM)  personnel  to  be available  for  use  by  the  service  leaders  and  the  Combatant  Commanders  (CCDR)  (see Chapter 6). 1.2.2.1.  COMCAM  is  a  rapid-deployment,  ground-  and/or  aerial-qualified  VI  activity trained  and  equipped  to  perform  visual  documentation  of  the  spectrum  of  missions  of wartime, contingencies, crises, and humanitarian assistance operations (See Chapter 6). 1.2.3.  The  video  production  mission  must  be  managed  by  a  central  service-level  office, which  oversees  the  use  of  facilities,  the  products,  and  approves  contracted  production requests (see Chapter 8). 1.2.3.1.  Video production is the process of structuring data from two or more media into a complete, linear or non-linear presentation, sequenced according to a plan or script. The production is created from original or stock motion or still images, with or without sound, for  the  purpose  of  conveying  information  to,  or  communicating  with,  an  individual  or audience. 8 AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 CHAPTER 2 MISSION ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.  VI  Mission  Roles  and  Responsibilities  Defined.  The  overall  management  of  the  AF  VI mission is performed at three primary levels: Air Force, Major Command (MAJCOM), and wing or  installation  level.  The  host  PA  office  performs  the  installation  level  VI  mission.  In  some instances,  a  dedicated  VI  mission  may  also  be  performed  at  the  unit  level  independently,  in  a non-host  tenant  organization.  In  addition  to  the  roles  and  responsibilities  below,  refer  to  Air Force Instruction (AFI) 35-101, Public Affairs Responsibilities and Management, for additional responsibilities. 2.1.1.  Air Force-Level Responsibilities. The Air Force VI Manager oversees the overall Air Force  VI  Program  and  is  designated  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  Office  of  Public Affairs  Command  Information  Division  (SAF/PAI)  Chief.  The  Air  Force  VI  Manager responsibilities include, but are not limited to: 2.1.1.1.  Serves as the Air Force Program Element (PE) Monitor over PE 12890. 2.1.1.2.

OPR  for  all  MAJCOM-owned  joint  base  VI  activities  and  reviews  and coordinates on VI Joint Base Common Output Levels of Service (JBCOLS). 2.1.4.  Base VI Manager (BVIM) Responsibilities. IAW DoDI 5040.02, each unit performing a  VI  mission  must  be  managed  by  a  designated  VI  Manager.  (T-0)  The  BVIM  is  a responsibility, not a duty position. The host-wing PA office is responsible for the base-wide VI mission and the wing commander must appoint  a BVIM in  writing. (T-0) There is  only one BVIM for each installation. The BVIM should be a functionally qualified expert in Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 35PX, 3N0XX, or civilian personnel  in  GS 1000 series. The BVIM  function  is  inherently  governmental.  Specific  responsibilities  include,  but  are  not limited to: 2.1.4.1.  SME for VI matters. 2.1.4.2.

All  requests  will  be  forwarded  to  AFPAA through  the  MAJCOM  A6  and  PA  offices,  and  SAF/CIO-A6,  for  final  approval  by AFPAA. (T-2) 2.1.4.10.  If the VI mission is required to be performed by more than one organization on a  base,  each  organization  that  performs  the  VI  mission  must  have  a  dedicated  mission 10 AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 DVIAN and BVIM duties must be performed specifically for the unit by a PA expert as outlined in paragraph 2.1.4. (T-0) 2.1.4.10.1.  The  unit's  designated  VI  manager  does  not  perform  base-wide  roles  as listed for the BVIM. The unit only provides VI products and services for the unit. (T-3) 2.1.4.10.2.  If  the  base  level  VI  mission  is  performed  by  a  contracted  operation,  an analysis should be performed to determine rights of exclusivity in the contract. 2.2.  Priority Missions Defined.  VI products are used throughout all operations. Because of the broad  array  of  requests  for  these  products  and  services,  there  are  generally  more  requests  than resources available to provide them. The VI mission for deployed personnel varies, but Airmen can expect to perform some or all priority missions, regardless of the location or situation. These include  all  visual-based  products  and  services  that  directly  relate  to  the  accomplishment  of  all deployed  commanders’  missions.  Therefore,  in-garrison  and  deployed  products  and  services should  be  prioritized  to  ensure  effective  management  controls,  and  to  enhance  customer expectations (see also Attachment 6, Air Force Decision Logic table). 2.2.1.  In-Garrison  Priority  Missions.  The  PA  office  serves  as  the  sole  provider  of professional  visual-based  products  and  services  to  all  commanders  on  an  installation  to directly  support  their  mission  accomplishment.  The  following  list  explains  missions supported. 2.2.1.1.  Leadership  and  Management.

Visual  Information  Documentation  (VIDOC)  Program.  VIDOC  is  motion,  still,  and audio  recording  of  technical  and  non-technical  events  that  are  made  while  occurring,  and  not usually under the production control of the recording element.  VIDOC includes documentation by PA and COMCAM forces. The Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), CCDRs, Air Expeditionary Unit  Commanders, and commanders at  all Air Force levels  use VIDOC imagery  as a decision-making  tool  for  critical  operational  assessment,  investigative,  legal,  and  their  leadership communication needs. 2.3.1.  The  VIDOC  program  ensures  that  Air  Force  wartime,  contingency/humanitarian operations,  historical,  and  newsworthy  events  are  visually  recorded.  Other  mission-related uses  are  military  information  support  operations,  training,  battle  damage  assessment,  post-strike assessments, public information, intelligence, and providing an accurate record of Air Force operations. The use of PA personnel and tasking procedures in contingency operations is outlined in AFI 35-111. 2.3.2.  All non-COMCAM PA personnel support their unit VIDOC requirements at both in-garrison  and  deployed  locations.  When  UTC  tasked,  non-COMCAM  PA  personnel  will support both unit level forces and VIDOC requirements. (T-1). 2.3.3.  Air  Force  Research,  Development,  Test  and  Evaluation  (RDT&E),  Intelligence, Surveillance  and  Reconnaissance  (ISR),  and  most  medical  VI  activities  perform include  high  speed  still  and  motion  media  optical photography/videography instrumentation.  Although information these  units  are  required to to  perform  visual AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 15 documentation,  the  imagery  they  acquire  may  not  be  mandated  to  be  accessioned  to  the DIMOC. Exclusions to this policy include those outlined in DoDI 5040.02, Enclosure 4. 2.3.4.  Responsibilities. 2.3.4.1.  SAF/PAI sets Air Force VIDOC policy. 2.3.4.2.  AFPAA  will  execute  VIDOC  management  on  behalf  of  SAF/PAI,  and  prepare plans for integrating new VIDOC technology and MISCAPs. (T-1). 2.3.4.3.  MAJCOM VI Managers: 2.3.4.3.1.  Plan  and  set  command  policy  for  documenting  in-garrison  and  deployed wing-level  activities  of  operational,  historical,  public  affairs,  or  other  significance within their commands. 2.3.4.3.2.  Coordinate  and  manage  to  ensure  documentation  needs  are  met  using available resources. 2.3.4.3.3.  Organize, train and equip VIDOC force packages to document activities to include  crises,  contingencies,  major  events,  Air  Force  and  joint  exercises,  and weapons tests, as appropriate. 2.3.4.3.4.  Ensure  VIDOC  force  packages  meet  their  wartime  taskings  and  identify and  resolve  deficiencies.  Refer  significant  deficiencies,  problems,  and  proposed resolutions to AFPAA. 2.3.4.3.5.  Ensure  documentation  of  significant  Air  Force  activities  and  events, regardless  of  their  sensitivity  or  classification.  Protect  materials  as  the  supported command  directs  in  processes  or  policies.  Safeguard  classified  images  and  handle them  according  to  AFI  16-1404,  Air  Force  Information  Security  Program.  The authority in charge of the event or operation approves documentation distribution. 2.3.4.3.6.  Ensure  status  and  availability  of  all  UTCs  is  reported  accurately  through the Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) Reporting Tool (ART), IAW AFI 10-244, Reporting Status of Aerospace Expeditionary Forces. 2.3.4.3.7.  Will use the Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) information in assessing  readiness,  determining  budgetary  allocation  and  management  actions impacts  on  unit  level  readiness,  answering  congressional  inquiries,  analyzing readiness  trends,  and  supporting  readiness  decisions.  See  AFI  10-201,  Force Readiness Reporting, for more information. 2.3.4.3.8.  Oversee measurements and evaluations in coordination with the MAJCOM inspector general office, such as inspection criteria, to evaluate VI force readiness at all command units. 2.3.4.4.  Public Affairs Officers (PAOs): 2.3.4.4.1.  Make sound judgments and decisions about VIDOC. Evaluate the need for documentation  of  events  based  on  analyzing  all  potential  uses  for  all  potential audiences. (Consult Attachment 6 for guidance.) 2.3.4.4.2.  Are  responsible  to  contact  internal  and  external  customers  as  well  as AFPAA and the DIMOC to determine if there is a need for documentation outside of 16 AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 the local requirements. Usually local VIDOC teams are tasked by higher headquarters if there is an outside need for VI coverage, but all potential customers are not always aware of every local event. 2.3.4.4.3.  Ensure  proper  handling  and  distribution  of  VIDOC  imagery.  Consult  the supporting MAJCOM with any questions on current processes. 2.3.5.  Transmitting or Shipping VIDOC Imagery. 2.3.5.1.  The  DIMOC,  located  at  Fort  Meade,  MD  serves  as  the  central  DoD  reception and distribution point  for current  COMCAM and VI imagery. The DIMOC makes such imagery  available  to  the  SECDEF,  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  (CJCS),  the Military  Departments,  Unified  Combatant  Commands,  Defense  Agencies,  other  DoD components, National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), other government agencies,  as  well  as  the  public.  After  clearance  by  local  authorities,  send  significant imagery to the Defense Video Imagery Distribution System (DVIDS). Clearly identify all imagery  with  the  appropriate  visual  information  record  identification  numbers  (VIRIN) and captions. Consult the supporting MAJCOM with any questions on current processes. 2.3.5.1.1.  Alternative imagery upload locations: 2.3.5.1.1.1.  May be emailed to jccc@mail.mil (max size of 15 MB). 2.3.5.1.1.2.  Secure  file  transfer  protocol  is  available  by  exception,  contact  the Joint Combat Camera Center (JCCC). 2.3.5.1.1.3.  Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center Safe  Access  File  Exchange  (AMRDEC  SAFE),  using  jccc@mail.mil  as  the recipient address. 2.3.5.1.1.4.  Send FOUO imagery (or imagery where release status is unknown) to the at https://dams.defenseimagery.mil/teams/Login.do?action=1 Imagery Defense Server 2.3.5.2.  Due  to  the  size  of  digital  video  files  and  Internet  connection  speeds,  it  is sometimes impossible to transmit extremely high resolution, archival quality video over the Internet. Under these circumstances, send the video twice: first in a lower resolution transmittable file via the Internet as rapidly as possible and second via mail in the camera original format via tape, DVD, Blu-Ray or hard drive. 2.3.5.3.  If camera original video is shot on tape, send the original tape labeled with the VIRIN. If camera original video is digital (non-tape format) place the uncompressed files into  a  directory  (folder)  labeled  with  the  same  VIRIN  as  the  transmittable  video  file. Depending on the  file size, use the appropriate  media (DVD,  Blu-Ray,  hard drive,  etc.) and deliver or mail to DIMOC. 2.3.5.4.  If electronic transmission is possible, send COMCAM and deployed VI motion imagery  directly  to  the  DIMOC  by  the  fastest  means  available,  following  the  approval procedures that have been established by on-scene and theater commanders. 2.4.  Alert Procedures. 2.4.1.  Alert  Duty.  Providing  alert  photo  and  video  support  is  a  critical  PA  duty.  Personnel must  be  trained  and  available,  on-call,  after  duty  hours,  weekends  and  holidays  to  handle AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 17 emergency  requirements.  (T-1).  Alert  personnel  are  notified  by  the  installation  command post or security forces desk directly, to ensure immediate response to document the scene to ensure evidence is uncompromised. The alert photographer and the PA on-call representative are  listed  separately  on  the  installation  command  post  on-call  list.  Both  have  independent requirements in the event of crises/contingencies and many events do not require both to be called.  Alert  photo  and  video  duty  requires  immediate  contact  through  the  use  of  a government  provided  electronic  device.  Personal  electronic  devices  should  not  be  used.  . Normally,  the  alert  personnel  report  directly  to  the  on-scene  commander  in  the  event  of  a major  accident  or  major  disaster.  Specific  instructions  for  the  alert  personnel  are  to  be published in a local operating instruction or similar guidance. (T-2). 2.4.1.1.  In a deployed environment, customers are deployed legal offices, security forces, safety,  special  investigating  offices,  host  nation  governments,  the  Department  of  State, DoD, CCDRs or the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). 2.4.1.2.  Alert  Photography/Video  provides  time-sensitive  documentation  of  disasters, mishaps, crime scenes, material deficiency reports and investigations. Examples include imagery of the incident site, damage to equipment or graphical depictions of the incident scene. For detailed information on support to weapons, space, aviation, and ground safety investigations and related mishaps, see AF Manual (AFMAN) 91-series. 2.4.1.3.  Emergency requests for alert support do not require immediate submission of an AF Form 833, Multimedia Work Order; however, an AF Form 833 should be completed before products are finished and released. 2.4.1.4.  Alert  personnel  will  only  release  alert  products  to  the  original  requester,  on-scene commander or their designated representative. (T-1) All information and products are  privileged  information  and  should  be  handled  as  such.  As  most  alert  imagery  is evidentiary in nature, a documented chain of custody is required and procedures must be established prior to the incident. (T-1). 2.4.2.  Alert personnel are notified by the installation command post or security forces desk sergeant.  The  alert  photographer/videographer  is  to  respond  back  within  15  minutes  to acknowledge  notification.  The  notifying  agency  should  inform  the  alert  personnel  where  to report,  who  to  contact  on  scene  and  the  type  of  incident.  Alert  response  times  should  be established  locally  for  normal  and  non-duty  duty  hours  with  mission  requirements  and  risk management in mind. 2.4.3.  Alert personnel will respond to alert duty calls only from the following requesters: (T-3) 2.4.3.1.  Wing or installation commander, or designated representative. 2.4.3.2.  Disaster Control Group. 2.4.3.3.  Command post representative. 2.4.3.4.  Security forces/Office of Special Investigations representative. 2.4.3.5.  Fire department representative. 2.4.3.6.  PAO. 2.4.3.7.  BVIM. 18 AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 2.5.  Investigative Procedures. fact finding.  Examples 2.5.1.  Definition: Products and services supporting agencies requiring documentation to  aid in time-sensitive documentation  of  natural  disasters,  mishaps,  crime  scenes,  material  deficiency  reports,  and other investigations. Types of investigations include but are not limited to: include  alert  photography/videography, 2.5.1.1.  Alert Photography/Video (see paragraph 2.4). 2.5.1.2.  Fratricide.

Examples  include  incident  site  photographs  and  video,  weapons  employed photography, graphical scene depiction or reproduction, weapon effects video, photos or graphics. 2.5.1.3.  Law of Armed Conflict. Products and services which support LOAC violations. Examples  include  incident  photographs  and  video,  graphical  depictions  of  weapons employed or charts recreating incident scenes. 2.5.2.  Procedures.  The  PAO  shall  coordinate  with  the  local  agencies  investigative photography  and  videography  procedures  and  establish  local  procedures  in  the  form  of  an operating instruction, or standard operating procedure. (T-3). Procedures should cover: 2.5.2.1.  Photographer/videographer safety. 2.5.2.1.1.  Personal protective equipment/measures. 2.5.2.1.2.  Safety briefing. 2.5.2.1.3.  Fall protection. 2.5.2.1.4.  Protection from machinery. 2.5.2.1.5.  Protection from moving vehicles. 2.5.2.1.6.  Protection from confined spaces (See AFI 91-203, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction) 2.5.2.1.7.  Safety issues involving use of flash/lighting equipment. 2.5.2.2.  Chain of custody. 2.5.2.3.  Scene documentation or evidence collection procedure. 2.5.2.3.1.  Photography logs. 2.5.2.3.2.  Labeling photographs. 2.5.2.3.3.  Photograph information maps. 2.6.  Quality  Control  (QC).  The  PAO  or  designee  shall  ensure  all  VI  products,  regardless  of medium, are reviewed for quality prior to customer acceptance. (T-0). QC should include: 2.6.1.  AP  Style  and  DoD  Visual  Information  Style  Guides.  The  guides  provide  a  standard method of writing. The publications help personnel in the creation of official DoD products that are clear, concise, meet DoD style standards and capture an accurate historical record. AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 19 2.6.2.  Official  DoD  imagery.  Imagery  must  not  be  altered  to  misinform  or  deceive  (T-0). Anything that weakens or casts doubt on the credibility of official DoD imagery in or outside the DoD will not be tolerated. 2.6.3.  Security, Accuracy, Propriety, and Policy (SAPP). 2.6.3.1.  Security refers to information that is formally classified or information that falls under  operational  security  (OPSEC)  or  Essential  Elements  of  Friendly  Information (EEFI). It can be divided into two categories: classified and sensitive. 2.6.3.1.1.  Release of classified information clearly violates security. 2.6.3.1.2.  Examples of sensitive information includes, but is not limited to: 2.6.3.1.2.1.  Troop strengths, unit capabilities, tactics, and precise troop locations. 2.6.3.1.2.2.  Charts,  maps  or  distinctive  terrain  features  in  the  background  of otherwise  harmless  video  and  photos  could  provide  valuable  information  to  the enemy. 2.6.3.1.2.3.  Long-range, wide-angle, and aerial video or still photos could reveal fortifications or the locations of key targets that could assist the enemy. 2.6.3.1.2.4.  GEO-Tagging  (photo  metadata),  if  capable,  should  be  removed during editing if requested or if needed due to mission set. 2.6.3.2.  Accuracy demands that public affairs sources provide only factual information, not speculation. 2.6.3.2.1.  Double check the information for your story or script. 2.6.3.2.1.1.  Spelling of Names. 2.6.3.2.1.2.  Ranks - Make sure you give the correct rank, regardless of the branch of service. 2.6.3.2.1.3.  Unit Designations - Ensure the designation is correct. 2.6.3.2.2.  Libel is words, pictures, videos or cartoons that expose a person to public hatred, shame, disgrace, ridicule or cause an ill opinion of a person and should not be used. 2.6.3.3.  Propriety.  PA  personnel  will  not  help  gather  or  publish  inappropriate descriptions  or  images.  (T-1)  Ensure  all  releases  are  in  good  taste.  They  should  not violate the sensitivities of the listening/viewing/reading audience. 2.6.3.3.1.  Ensure  released  products  don’t  contain  profanity,  gore,  perversion, excessive  violence,  obscenity,  lewdness  and  information  that  holds  a  service  or  its members up to ridicule. 2.6.3.3.2.  Propriety (and often policy) also pertains to the advertising of commercial products.  It  is  inappropriate to  release information that gives the perception of DoD endorsing a product; release information that places organizations in an unnecessary negative  light;  release  information  that  shows  bias  toward  commercial  products  or agencies, etc. 20 AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 2.6.3.4.  Policy is striving to keep the public fully informed of all unclassified activities. This requires the full and prompt release of both good and bad news. There are, however, restrictions and limitations placed on the release of some information: when it is released, how it is released, and who can release it. AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 21 CHAPTER 3 VI ACTIVITY MANAGEMENT AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES 3.1.  Defense  Visual  Information  Activity  Number  (DVIAN)  Mandates,  Definition  and Responsibilities.  DoDI  5040.02  directs  component  services  to  manage  VI  activities  and resources  with  effective  management  controls.  A  VI  activity  is  any  unit  or  portion  of  a  unit which  performs  the  VI  mission,  creates  VI  products,  or  provides  VI  services.  AFPAA  is  the approving authority (on behalf of SAF/PA) for Air Force organizations to operate VI activities, and  assigns  DVIANs  (see  attachment  2,  DVIAN  Classification)  to  units.  AFPAA/AOX maintains the service-level DVIAN registry for the Air Force. VI Managers at all levels should maintain  a  copy  of  current  DVIAN  authorization  documents.  Additionally,  MAJCOM  PA  and band offices will maintain copies of all DVIAN authorization documents for all units within their command. (T-1) 3.1.1.  Requests for new VI activities, changes of mission, or additional Functional Account Code authorizations, using AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization as a guide, require approval by  the  MAJCOM  PA  Directors  or  designee,  and  Air  Force  approval  by  AFPAA.  The requesting unit’s commander (or equivalent), with support from the organization’s PA office, will certify that the VI activity request includes the purpose, deliverables, funding, manning, and sustainment source for the new activity. (T-1). 3.1.2.  For new DVIAN requests at installations where an approved VI activity already exists, the  requesting  agency  forwards  its  request  through  the  host-Wing  PA  office  to  the  hosting MAJCOM PA office for coordination and validation. If not validated, the request is returned for  final  disposition  or  further  justification.  If  validated,  the  MAJCOM  PA  office  then forwards it to AFPAA (afpaa.aox@us.af.mil) for approval. If the requesting agency belongs to  a  different  MAJCOM,  the  hosting  MAJCOM  PA  office  coordinates  with  the  owning MAJCOM’s PA office to  determine the need. The host’s MAJCOM  PA office forwards all coordinated  documentation  to  AFPAA  for  approval.  All  Field  Operating  Agencies  (FOAs) and Direct Reporting Units (DRUs) send requests directly to AFPAA for approval. (T-1). 3.1.3.  DVIANs  are  revalidated  every  five  years,  or  whenever  the  current  DVIAN’s  unit designation  changes.  MAJCOM  VI  and  band  managers  should  inform  AFPAA  when  the current  DVIAN’s  designated  VI  Manager  changes  in  order  to  keep  records  current.  The installation PA or band office BVIM will ensure that a revalidation request is completed and sent  through  the  host  installation  commander  and  MAJCOM  PA  office  to  AFPAA/AOX (afpaa.aox@us.af.mil).  (T-1).  Requests  for  revalidation  should  include  the  following information: 3.1.3.1.  Copies  of  previous  and  current  mission/function  statements,  AFSCs/Series  of UMD  positions,  and  UTCs  supported.  Units  must  have  at  least  one  PA  AFSC/Series position on the UMD. (T-1) 3.1.3.2.  A list of authorized functions performed (attachment 2). 3.1.3.3.  A list of supported units, agencies, activities, or locations. Include copies of the host tenant and inter-service support agreements. 3.1.3.4.  Wing commander certification that the function is still needed. 22 AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 3.1.4.  All organizations or units who possess an approved DVIAN are required to coordinate with AFPAA/AOX to establish an account in the AIM2 database tool, and perform all AIM2 functions,  including  tracking  production  and  performing  equipment  lifecycle  management functions. (T-1) 3.2.  VI Contract Support. 3.2.1.  Contracting.  PA  may  contract  with  commercial  firms  for  VI  services  and  products. These contracts will be awarded in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and AFI 63-138, Acquisition of Services. (T-0) Oral contracts are not acceptable. Contracts must be in writing and awarded by an appropriately warranted contracting official. (T-1). The only office authorized to negotiate contracts with commercial activities is the servicing installation Contracting Office. 3.2.1.1.  Contracts  for  Video  Productions.  MAJCOM  and  installation  PA  offices  are recommended  to  periodically  contact  the  appropriate  installation  contracting  official, usually the contracting squadron commander, to ensure they know that the Air Force has in-house  video  production  capability  available  to  satisfy  most  official  video  production requirements. Detailed information on Video Production Management contract processes is outlined in Chapter 8. 3.2.1.2.  The MAJCOM or installation PA office are to request the servicing installation contracting officer to include a referral to the installation PA office in internal contracting processes  and  related  instructions  to  contracting  customers  regarding  preparation  of relevant acquisition packages for VI equipment, products, and/or services. 3.2.1.3.  PA offices are to request the servicing installation Contracting Office to provide support  when  developing  VI  requirements  (for  example,  Performance  Work  Statements and Statements of Work), and shall request the servicing installation Contracting Office to  contact  the  PA  office  when  any  unit  submits  a  VI  product  or  equipment  purchase request  (T-2).  The  local  communications  squadron  must  also  be  coordinated  with  when any VI purchase request includes information technology equipment or software (T-2). 3.2.2.  Facilities.  The  PAO  should  continually  and  actively  seek  facilities  in  which  all organizationally-owned VI mission functions can be geographically-collocated for improved efficiency.  This  permits  more  effective  and  economical  operations,  management  and  space utilization. 3.2.2.1.  The  PAO  should  contact  the  installation  servicing  civil  engineering  facility board  for  guidance  and  clarification  on  facility  requirements,  including  repairs  and upkeep. Further information on space allowances can be found in AFI 32-1024, Standard Facility Requirements and AFMAN 32-1084, Facility Requirements. 3.2.3.  Gratuities. Air Force military and civilian employees and their families are prohibited from soliciting or accepting any gratuity from a prospective or current contractor. (T-0). 3.2.4.  Conflict of Interest. PA personnel shall avoid any situation that may be perceived as or may  cause  a  conflict  of  interest  in  any  relationship  with  a  contractor.  (T-0).  Consult  DoD 5500.07-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), or with the local legal office whenever a potential conflict of interest situation arises for more information. 3.3.  Authorized Use of Air Force VI Resources. AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 23 3.3.1.  Air Force VI resources (personnel, equipment, facilities, funding, etc.) are government property to be used solely for support to official Air Force organizations and their missions, DoD or other government agencies per current host-tenant support agreement, memorandum of agreement, or similar vehicle. 3.3.1.1.  VI materials generated or acquired in conducting official duties are the property of  the  United  States  Air  Force.  As  such,  protect  these  materials  and  preserve  them  as official records, according to public law. 3.3.1.2.  Air  Force  military  and  civilian  personnel  should  obtain  a  security  review  and approval from PA prior to releasing outside the DoD any VI material depicting military persons,  places,  or  material.  Posting  unauthorized  photos,  videos,  or  descriptions  of missions,  resources,  or  facilities  on  the  internet  in  any  forum  without  public  release approval  from  PA  can  aid  an  adversary.  Therefore,  distribution,  transfer,  or  posting  of visual  images,  whether  electronically  or  physically,  without  proper  security  and  policy review, is prohibited. 3.3.1.3.  Personnel  who  possess  mission-related  VI  on  personally-owned  devices,  the capture of which is not otherwise prohibited, may not release such mission-related VI to media organizations, non-governmental  organizations, or other public forums,  including but  not  limited  to  Internet  websites  or  individuals  or  organizations  affiliated  with documentaries, motion pictures, news outlets, social media sites, blogs, or other websites, without security review and approval at an appropriate command level. 3.3.1.4.  Personal use of VI materials for sale or any other reason not directly related to an  official  Air  Force  activity  is  discouraged,  and  in  some  cases  prohibited.  (T-0)  When necessary, contact  the local  staff judge  advocate  for  guidance or clarification.  This  may also  apply  when  Air  Force  members  or  employees,  by  choice  or  agreement,  use personally-owned  equipment  or  supplies  while  performing  official  duties.  Note:  Use  of government-owned  self-help  equipment  requires  users  to  adhere  to  operational  security and information security guidelines. (T-0). 3.3.2.  Do not use government-funded VI resources to (T-1): 3.3.2.1.  Provide personal souvenirs or gifts (e.g. farewell gifts). 3.3.2.2.  Provide  décor  for  individual  personal  office  walls.  Products  for  organizational areas may be provided depicting relevant missions performed. 3.3.2.3.  Support  or  document  farewell  parties  or  social  events  unless  certified  as newsworthy  or  having  historical  significance  by  the  base  historian  or  chief  of  PA. Accession all imagery according to Chapter 9. 3.3.2.4.  Create products used primarily for entertainment during farewell parties or social events. 3.3.2.5.  Support  Force  Support  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation  (MWR)  non-appropriated  funded  (NAF)  missions.  Provide  only  limited  support  to  Force  Support MWR NAF recognition programs as described in paragraph 4.3.1.5. 3.3.2.6.  Unauthorized requests. If it is unclear whether it is authorized, consult the chief of PA or ultimately the base legal office for clarification when necessary. 24 AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 3.4.  Alteration of Official Air Force Imagery.  PA professionals must not alter imagery. (T-0). PA professionals create products that can be used in legal proceedings and for critical decision-making.  Therefore,  absolute  trust  and  confidence  in  the  truthfulness  of  products  they  create  is essential. See DoDI 5040.02, for specific policy on alterations of official imagery. 3.5.  General Photography and Video Imagery Guidelines. 3.5.1.  Photography  and  video  imagery  are  essential  elements  of  internal  and  external communication  programs.  Imagery  conveys  the  mission  of  the  Air  Force  to  internal  and external  audiences  and  helps  achieve  the  PA  core  competencies  of  Airman  morale  and readiness, public trust and support, and global influence and deterrence. 3.5.2.  Imagery  taken  by  AF  personnel  using  personal  cameras  and  equipment  for  non-official purposes will be considered personal imagery as long as it is not related to missions, operations, exercises, and training (hereinafter “mission-related VI”). (T-1) 3.5.2.1.  AF personnel who capture mission-related VI on personally owned devices must comply with the provisions of Attachment 5 of this instruction. (T-1) 3.5.2.2.  Mission-related VI captured on personally owned devices may be determined to be  official  DoD  VI  and  a  work  of  the  United  States  Government  if  the  employee  or military member used their official position or duties to obtain it (such as gaining access to military operations). 3.5.3.  Ceremonial  video  documentation  is  limited  to  those  honoring  MAJCOM,  numbered air  force,  wing  and  their  vice/deputy  wing  commanders,  general  officers  and  civilian equivalents,  important  historical  figures  such  as  Medal  of  Honor  recipients,  Order  of  the Sword recipients, or aerial aces for accessioning or for media dissemination. 3.5.4.  Imagery  Release.  Official  images  of  military  and  civilian  DoD  employees  generally are  publicly  releasable.  Images  of  Air  Force  activities  and  people  are  publicly  releasable. However, an image may not be releasable if it depicts matters that would constitute a clearly unwarranted  invasion  of  personal  privacy,  compromise  operational  security,  or  negatively impact  mission effectiveness.  See AFI 35-104,  Media Operations, and  Chapter  8 for more information.  The  installation  PA  office  is  approval  authority  for  public  release  of  the following  types  of  imagery:  (T-1).  (Also  refer  to  AFI  91-series  instructions  for  Air  Force safety programs). 3.5.4.1.  A release is not needed from: 3.5.4.1.1.  People  involved  in  newsworthy  and  public  events,  where  it  is  deemed plausible that anyone could record them there. 3.5.4.1.2.  People who are presented as members of a large crowd. 3.5.4.2.  Fatalities or Injuries. 3.5.4.2.1.  Release  of  official  or  stock  news  images  of  Air  Force  casualties  is permitted after next-of-kin (NOK) notification. 3.5.4.2.2.  Release of visual imagery  regarding the return of casualties to  the United States,  following  DoD  guidance  and  primary  NOK  approval.  Identifiable  U.S. civilians who are injured must provide written consent before release of imagery. (T-AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 25 0) For more information, refer to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. 3.5.4.3.  Children/Minors. 3.5.4.3.1.  When documenting children under age 18, a parent or legal guardian must sign a DD Form 2830, General Talent Release, or DD Form 2831, General Release Where Talent Fee or Other Remuneration or Recompense Accrues to the Participant, allowing use of the child’s image. (T-0) 3.5.4.3.2.  No  exemption  exists  for  documentation  of  Airmen,  Reserve  Officer Training Corps (ROTC) or Junior ROTC cadets under age 18. The intent of the use of public  release  forms  and  processes  is  to  protect  the  privacy  and  security  of  subject individuals, and to protect the legal interests of the government. 3.5.4.4.  Courtrooms/Accused  Persons.  Generally,  cameras  aren’t  allowed courtroom even if media are in attendance. in the 3.5.4.5.  Installations. Unclassified images of installations are generally releasable. They will  meet  the  guidelines  on  releasing  unclassified  information,  including  security  and policy review requirements. (T-1). 3.5.4.6.  Imagery involving nuclear weapons. See AFI 35-104 for updated information on this type of imagery that is and is not releasable. (T-1). 3.5.4.7.  Documentation  of  Activities  Prohibited  From  Release.  Installation  PA  offices shall document activities as required, including classified missions. (T-1). Just because an event is not releasable does not restrict Air Force PA professionals from documenting a scene  to  fulfill  the  mission.  Clearance  and  release  procedures  apply  after  imagery acquisition and not during imagery acquisition. 3.5.4.7.1.  Sensitive missions. 3.5.4.7.1.1.  Sensitive  missions  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  movement  of detainees/enemy  prisoners  of  war,  special  operations  activities,  detainee operations, handling of human casualties, and repatriations of remains. 3.5.4.7.1.2.  Prior to any mission or activity, PA will ensure official public release IAW  AFI  35-102,  Security  Policy  and  Review  Process.  (T-0)  This  restriction applies  to  any  mission,  whether  executed  at  home  station  or  while  deployed  in support  of  contingency  operations.  Air  Force  members  overseas  must  comply with  status  of  forces  agreements,  the  laws  of  the  host  nation,  and  other instructions of the combatant commander responsible for that area. (T-0). 3.5.4.7.2.  Potential  privacy  violation.  Refer  to  DoD  5400.11-R,  Department  of Defense Privacy Program, for definitions of privacy issues. 3.5.4.7.3.  Detainees or Human Casualties in some situations. 3.5.4.7.3.1.  Documentation  is  permitted  in  the  execution  of  official  duties.  All other documentation is prohibited. (T-1). 3.5.4.7.3.2.  Operational, internal-use-only  documentation  by  Air  Force photographers or broadcasters operating in their official capacity is exempt from 26 AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 this  policy.  Mission  needs  require  Air  Force  public  affairs  personnel  to  act  as trusted agents and cover the full spectrum of visual documentation. Existing DoD and Air Force policy governs their actions. 3.5.4.7.3.3.  These guidelines apply to all Air Force military, civilian, or contract personnel serving with, employed by, or accompanying the Air Force, except for personnel assigned to defense attaché offices, security detachments, and sensitive intelligence  and  counterintelligence  activities  that  are  conducted  under  the direction  and  control  of  the  Chief  of  Mission/Chief  of  Station  or  other  U.S. Government agencies and departments identified on a case-by-case basis. In these cases,  personnel  are  to  abide  by  the  policies  of  the  appropriate  organization  or command. 3.5.4.7.4.  Suffering or mutilated persons. 3.5.4.7.5.  Restricted areas, control points, or security measures. 3.5.4.7.6.  Medical Personnel Bearing Arms. Medical personnel may only carry arms for  self-defense.  Visually  documenting  medical  personnel  with  weapons  may  create the false impression that these personnel are violating laws of war and needlessly risk their safety. 3.5.4.7.7.  Merchandise  Endorsements.  Do  not  release  photographs  of  Air  Force people with products or merchandise with trade names appearing in such a way they imply Air Force endorsement. 3.5.4.7.8.

Troop  strengths,  unit  capabilities, locations. tactics,  and  precise troop AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 27 3.5.4.7.14.2.  Charts,  maps  or  distinctive  terrain  features  in  the  background  of otherwise harmless video and photos which could provide valuable information to the enemy. 3.5.4.7.14.3.  Long-range, wide-angle, and aerial video or still photos which could reveal fortifications or the locations of key targets that could assist the enemy. 3.5.4.7.14.4.  GEO-Tagging  (photo  metadata),  if  capable,  should  be  removed during editing if requested or if needed due to mission set. 3.5.5.  Appearance  of  Military  Members  in  Imagery.  Personal  appearance  will  conform  to AFI  36-2903,  Dress  and  Personal  Appearance  of  Air  Force  Personnel.  (T-1)  Pay  careful attention  to  Air  Force  safety  standards  for  people  and  equipment,  such  as  required  wear  of safety goggles or hearing protection. Wing commanders and chiefs of PA may waive the AFI 36-2903 guidelines when recent mission and operational duties result in imagery that shows Air Force people with non-serviceable uniforms. 3.5.6.  Legal and Financial Protection. VI will be created by PA personnel using government equipment as part of their official duties. (T-1) 3.5.6.1.  PA  personnel  designated  to  create  VI  as  part  of  their  official  duties  will  be trained  to  follow  VI  standards  and  procedures  in  accordance  with  DoDI  5160.48,  DoD Public Affairs and Visual Information (PA&VI) Education and Training (E&T), the DoD VI Style Guide, and this instruction. (T-1) 3.5.6.2.  The use of personal equipment to create official AF VI is strongly discouraged. Except as authorized for official use and purposes, personnel are prohibited from taking, making,  possessing,  reproducing,  uploading,  or  transferring  in  any  way  photographs, videos,  depictions,  audio-visual  recordings,  and  any  other  VI  on  personal  recording devices (including devices with photography, audio, or video recording capabilities) 3.5.6.3.  VI  created  by  AF  personnel  as  part  of  their  official  duties  using  personal equipment will be considered works of the United States Government. (T-1) 3.5.7.  Photography  and/or  Television/Video  in  the  studio.  Each  installation  host  PA  office must maintain and operate a studio. See Attachment 5 for guidance. (T-1). 28 AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 Chapter 4 INSTALLATION VI SUPPORT (DVIAN TYPE A) 4.1.  Requesting  VI  Support.  The  host  wing  PA  office,  as  the  OPR  for  VI,  is  required  to support the installation with VI products and services, including photography, video services and graphic  arts  (where  applicable).  All  requirements  for  VI  support  must  be  requested  on  an  AF Form  833.  (T-1).  VI  support  to  all  commanders  on  an  installation  should  be  performed  with effective management controls, IAW DoDI 5040.02 and DoDI 5040.07. 4.2.  VI  Products  and  Services  Management.  All  VI  products  and  services  missions  are performed  by  personnel  in  the  military  AFSCs  of  35P,  35B,  3N0XX,  3N1XX,  3N2XX,  and civilians in the 1001, 1020, 1035, 1060, 1071, 1082, 1084 series, or via a contracted VI activity (see attachment 4). VI includes still photography, motion photography, audio, video, photo and broadcast  journalism  products,  and  graphics.  No  VI  work  is  to  be  performed  by  any  other organization or personnel other than listed above without the advice of the BVIM and approval of the PAO. (T-3). 4.2.1.  IAW  35-series  AFIs,  the  VI  prioritized  missions  must  be  performed  at  all  Air  Force installations by the Type A DVIAN host-wing PA office. (T-0) Because  these missions are numerous and resources are finite, they must be managed in conjunction with Attachment 6. (T-1). 4.2.2.  Priority System. The PAO and BVIM must establish and publish a priority system that considers  urgency,  mission  impact,  agencies  supported,  missions,  task  complexity  and resources  available.  (T-2)  The  purpose  of  a  priority  system  is  to  meet  critical  timelines, schedule work and satisfy customer requirements. This priority system must be approved and signed by the wing commander. (T-2). Once signed, this priority system should be posted in the  customer  service  area  and  made  available  on  the  base  website.  This  enables  staff  to determine  which  missions  should  be  accomplished  first  and  educate  customers  to  manage their  expectations.  The  following  examples  of  priorities  serve  as  guidance  and  are recommended to be used to create an installation-specific priority system to locally manage and  allocate  resources  and  man-hours  when  mission  requirements  exceed  resource capabilities: 4.2.2.1.  Priority  1  -  Urgent.  Work  of  an  emergency  or  catastrophic  nature  with  a  short, time-sensitive period of informational value. Priority 1 requests take precedence over all other  support.  The  BVIM  should  consult  the  PAO  or  wing  commander  if  necessary  to facilitate prioritization of resources when conflicts arise. Normal lead-time is immediate. Support to Priority 1 includes: 4.2.2.1.1.  Alert Photo or Video Documentation for: 4.2.2.1.1.1.  Aircraft accidents, Class A mishaps and accidents/incidents involving a fatality and investigation support/boards. (Refer to AF 91-series instructions for specific instructions.) 4.2.2.1.1.2.  Command  post  requirements:  Base  crises,  man-made  or  natural disasters. 4.2.2.1.1.3.

Significant damage to government property. 4.2.2.1.2.  Time-sensitive  or  perishable  public  affairs  photography  or  videography required for news media release. 4.2.2.1.3.  Emergency war orders. 4.2.2.1.4.  Contingency operations. 4.2.2.1.5.  Inspector General activities. 4.2.2.1.6.  Coverage for intelligence collection. 4.2.2.1.7.  Any mission deemed urgent by the wing commander. 4.2.2.2.  Priority  2  -  Critical.  Work  requests  which  are  essential  in  direct  support  of  the installation  operational  missions  and  which  cannot  be  regularly  scheduled  in  advance. Normal  lead-time  is  1  to  3  days.  Although  a  minimum  of  1-day  lead-time  is  specified, any listed requirement below may be elevated to Priority 1 (immediate) as determined by the wing commander. Support to Priority 2 includes: 4.2.2.2.1.  Releases  to  news  media  and  incidents  involving  injury,  or  impairment  of operational capability. 4.2.2.2.2.  Flying/Ground safety. 4.2.2.2.3.  Maintenance, munitions and force protection. 4.2.2.2.4.  Wing readiness, situational awareness. 4.2.2.2.5.  Flying operations. 4.2.2.3.  Priority  3  -  Essential  (Scheduled  basis).  Work  supporting  operational  mission and training requirements and programs of assigned and tenant units that is handled on a scheduled  basis.

Community Engagement programs. 4.2.2.3.3.  Commander’s mission briefings. 4.2.2.3.4.  Formal training. 4.2.2.3.5.  Distinguished Visitor events. 4.2.2.3.6.  Documentation of Official Ceremonies. 4.2.2.4.  Priority 4 - Routine. All authorized work of a routine nature that does not qualify for  any  priority  listed  above.  Work  should  be  accomplished  on  a  first  in-first  out  basis. Lead time is normally 5 to 10 days, or less, depending upon resource availability. Support to Priority 4 includes: 4.2.2.4.1.  Status boards. 4.2.2.4.2.  Organizational charts. 30 AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 4.2.2.4.3.  Photographs  for  official  records  (Official  photos,  special  duty  assignment photos, etc.). 4.2.2.4.4.  Awards and decorations. 4.2.2.4.5.  Command interest items. 4.2.2.5.  All  Priority  1  requests  are  approved  by  the  PAO  or  designated  representative. The  BVIM  should  receive  approval  from  the  PAO  to  elevate  any  Priority  2-4  work  to Priority 1. The BVIM has first-hand knowledge of the necessary resources, processes and capabilities, and should determine if special equipment, supplies or manning are required. 4.3.  Resource Protection.  Each request for service shall be reviewed to ensure that the work to be  accomplished  is  legal,  is  for  official  purposes,  and  whether  or  not  the  request  can  be supported.  (T-1).  Work  shall  not  be  accomplished  if  it  violates  Air  Force  policy,  or  it  may infringe  on  copyright  laws.  (T-0).  It  is  everyone's  responsibility  to  protect  VI  resources  and prevent  fraud,  waste,  and  abuse.  The  wing  commander  has  ultimate  authority  to  approve  any work in question to be accomplished. 4.3.1.  Restrictions.  The  BVIM  should  be  familiar  with  the  following  agencies  when determining scope of responsibilities and capabilities: 4.3.1.1.  Defense  Logistics  Agency  (DLA)  Document  Services.  Coordinate  on  the construction of reproduction masters and to determine size or multiple color restrictions. See DoDI 5330.03, DLA Document Services, for more information. 4.3.1.2.  History and Heraldry Missions. AFI 84-101, Historical Products, Services, and Requirements, provides instructions on researching organizational emblems, patches and decals. If the installation PA office is tasked to produce original reproduction masters of these  items,  the  History  Office  is  a  resource  to  assist  PA  to  verify  prior  organizational usage and define appropriate color schemes. Ensure use of the Air Force Symbol and all other Air Force trademarks is  in  compliance with  AFI 35-114, Air Force Branding and Trademark Licensing Program. 4.3.1.3.  Base Publishing Office. This office should be consulted for work requests for the production masters of forms, letterheads, note pads, invitations, book covers, etc. Many customers do not know official forms exist, such as certificate blanks, and that they may be suitable to meet their requirement. 4.3.1.4.  Base  Legal  Office.  This  office  should  be  consulted  for  advice  on  requests  that are difficult to assess for legality in relation to policy. The most challenging area to assess is  with  copyright  infringement.  Consult  AFI  51-303,  Intellectual  Property—Patents, Patent Related Matters, Trademarks and Copyrights. Every effort must be made by PA and/or  the  customer  to  confer  with  the  Legal  Office  on  how  to  gain  approval  to  use copyrighted material from the copyright owner before it can be used or reproduced. (T-0) 4.3.1.5.  Support  for  Appropriated  Fund  Force  Support  MWR  Activities.  Force  Support activities are  authorized  to  receive VI support for category A (Mission Sustaining), and category B (Basic Community Support Activities). Category A programs are essential to the  military  mission  and  are  authorized  all  support.  Category  B  activities  are  closely related to Category A activities and are essentially community support programs. The PA office can furnish support to these activities as long as the specific Force Support MWR AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 31 activity does not generate revenue, or the requested VI product is not intended to generate revenue.  For  additional  clarification  of  MWR  activities,  refer  to  AFI  65-106, Appropriated  Fund  Support  of  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation  (MWR)  and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIS). 4.3.1.6.  Financial Management Office. Consult the Financial Management Office for any needed  clarification  regarding  authorized  use  of  PA  support  for  any  requests  for  VI products whose purpose involves use of Air Force funds to purchase anything, or for the use of fundraising. As a general rule, VI products may not be used to generate revenue, but there are exceptions. 4.3.1.7.  Servicing  installation  Contracting  Office.  Consult  the  servicing  installation Contracting Office for clarification on any issues. 4.4.  Customer Relations.  The PA office is to exercise optimum customer relations to provide a high degree of integrity between the customer and PA professionals. 4.4.1.  Customer  feedback  is  an  important  part  of  customer  relations.  MAJCOMs  should institute  the  use  of  command-standard  Customer  Critiques  issued  with  each  work  order  or placed in a prominent place on the customer service counter. 4.4.2.  Alternatively or in conjunction with critiques, prominently display the BVIM’s name, phone  number  and/or  photo  to  give  customers  a  point  of  authority  to  go  to  for  problems, questions or to simply acknowledge appreciation. 4.4.3.  A customer service guide should be available for all customers which includes: 4.4.3.1.  Hours of operation. 4.4.3.2.  Facility location(s). 4.4.3.3.  The Priority System. 4.4.3.4.

(T-3). the designated  Government  Purchase  Card 5.2.1.1.  The  BVIM  should  coordinate  annually  with  the  Logistics  Support/Equipment Management  Office, (GPC) Agency/Organization Program Coordinator, and servicing installation Contracting Office personnel  to  prevent  unauthorized imagery  equipment acquisition by unauthorized units or personnel. The Logistics Support/Equipment Management Office, the designated GPC Agency/Organization Program Coordinator, and servicing installation Contracting Office, should  have  processes  in  place  to  ensure  coordination  with  the  BVIM,  to  prevent  any unauthorized purchases of AS 629 equipment by unapproved units. 5.2.1.2.  The host wing communications squadron must include computer equipment and software  that  supports  VI  missions  in  the  information  processing  management  system, per AFMAN 17-1203, Information Technology (IT) Asset Management (ITAM), and must coordinate  with  the  BVIM  for  approval  on  all  requests  from  units  on  the  installation  to purchase such items. (T-3) AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 33 5.2.2.  Combat  camera,  broadcasting,  still  photographic  and  graphics/visual  design equipment for quantities not listed/authorized in AS 629 are requested on AF Form 601 and submitted  to  the  base  equipment  management  office  on  AF  Form  9,  Request  for  Purchase, and processed through the servicing installation contracting office. 5.3.  Equipment Review Panel (ERP).  AFPAA chairs the Air Force PA/VI Equipment Review Panel. 5.3.1.  The  ERP  acts  as  the  Air  Force  advisory  board  researching  the  application  and integration of new technologies into the Air Force PA missions. The ERP provides AFPAA effective  management  controls  to  anticipate  and  evaluate  new  technology,  regularly  update equipment  standards,  and  balance  equipment  requirements  against  overall  Air  Force priorities and available funding. 5.3.2.  MAJCOMs/DRUs/FOAs ensure representation of their unique missions and designate ERP members who are subject matter experts. 5.3.3.  The  ERP  has,  as  a  minimum,  a  semi-annual  teleconference.  The  ERP  develops standardized  equipment  lists  for  base-level  PA  missions,  video  production  centers,  and  the combat camera squadrons. 5.3.3.1.  Future  PA/VI  equipment  and  service  procurement  expenditures  by  MAJCOMs and AFPAA will be based upon adherence to these standardized equipment lists. (T-1) 5.3.3.2.  The  standard  equipment  lists  should  address  in-garrison  and  deployed  mission requirements. 5.3.3.3.  The ERP appoints equipment test units for extensive evaluations. The ERP can recommend that a prototype be purchased and tested at the test units. 5.3.4.  The  ERP  only  processes  equipment  standardization  and  evaluation,  and  does  not participate in the process to authorize or disallow local purchases of equipment according to AS 629. 5.4.  The  Visual  Information  Equipment  Plan.  AFPAA  administers  the  VIEP  for  the  Air Force. The VIEP is a five-year programming document tied to the Future Years Defense Plan. It is a management tool used to identify, plan, assess priorities and budget for AFPAA, MAJCOM, or installation procured standardized PA/VI equipment to meet mission needs. The VIEP is not the sole source that funds PA equipment requirements. Wing PA offices should continue to use the local operating budget to purchase requirements in support of the mission. 5.4.1.  Each fiscal year, AFPAA evaluates equipment and systems requirements identified in the VIEP against the funding allocated for that year. If funding falls below requirements, then equipment  not  funded  carries  over  into  the  next  year  as  validated  unfunded  requirements. AFPAA  uses  these  unfunded  requirements  to  justify  additional  funding  for  the  next  year. MAJCOM  PA  offices  and  PA  units  are  also  encouraged  to  submit  unfunded  requirements through local channels, adhering to standards set forth by the ERP. 5.4.2.  The  BVIM  must  assess  the  needs  of  organizations  on  the  installation  possessing DVIANs  and  must  prepare  the  VIEP  using  the  AIM2  database  system  and  VIEP  process guidelines established by AFPAA. (T-2). The  BVIM  ensures equipment  requested does not exceed  the  minimum  quality  and  quantity  levels  needed  to  accomplish  task  requirements. 34 AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 Most applications require industrial, professional grade equipment IAW federal law. BVIMs should complete each item of the VIEP, providing clear and concise information. 5.4.3.  MAJCOM VI Managers, or designee, will prioritize VIEP submissions semiannually in the AIM2 by 1 March and 1 September. (T-1). The March submission sets the baseline for end of year requests and the September submission sets the baseline for annual purchases. 5.4.4.  The  BVIM  is  to  continually  review  and  update  the  VIEP,  ensuring  currency  of requirements and reflecting successful purchases by other means. 5.5.  Acquisition  of  Equipment.  Along  with  the  Visual  Information  Equipment  Plan  (VIEP), other sources exist for the acquisition of equipment. 5.5.1.  Transfers.  A  prime  source  is  from  other  organizations  which  no  longer  have  a requirement for a certain piece of equipment. The equipment can be obtained by Intercustody Receipt/Transfer (FET) or Accountability Transfer (FME) action through the base equipment management office (EMO) at base supply. The FET action is between organizations on base and  FME  is  between  organizations  from  different  bases.  AFI  23-101,  Air  Force  Material Management, or the EMO can assist with any questions. 5.5.2.  Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Disposition Services. DLA Disposition Services is responsible  for  the  reuse,  transfer,  donation,  sale  or  disposal  of  excess  property.  Regional locations are located throughout the continental United States. PA offices should check with those  facilities  frequently  for  possible  serviceable  equipment  available  for  free  issue  to military organizations. 5.5.3.  Depot-funded  Equipment.  Seek  local  support  from  servicing  supply  units  for  details on this central-funded purchasing program. 5.6.  Report of Survey (ROS). 5.6.1.  A  ROS  documents  the  circumstances  concerning  the  loss,  damage  or  destruction  of Air  Force  property  and  serves  as  or  supports  a  voucher  for  adjusting  the  property  from accountable  records.  It  also  documents  a  charge  of  financial  liability  assessed  against  an individual or entity or provides for relief from financial liability. Refer to AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property, or the installation EMO for further clarification. 5.6.2.  All accountable equipment and high dollar non-equipment and pilferable assets within the DVIAN-authorized activity must be listed in AIM2. (T-1). (AIM2).  AIM2 (located Information  Multimedia  Manager 5.7.  Automated at https://aim2.acc.af.mil/)  is  a  web-based  automated  information  system  designed  for  users  to input information and query a database to extract information regarding current unit information, equipment requirements and inventory status at each unit, and production reporting information for  each  DVIAN-authorized  VI  activity.  AIM2  assists  AFPAA  and  MAJCOM  leadership  with decision-making  analysis  for  the  VIEP  and  Production  Reporting  throughout  the  Air  Force  PA community.  Note:  ANG and Air  Force Reserve  Command (AFRC) are not  required to  use the AIM2 system for equipment inventory and VIEP submissions; however, AIM2 is available as an optional  tool  for  equipment  inventory  and  requirement  programming  and  should  provide justification for budget estimates for future years based upon past years activities. 5.7.1.  The BVIM or delegated representative where more than one activity resides on a base logs  and  tracks  all  resources,  man-hours,  and  activities  and  populates  the  production  report AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 35 monthly  for  their  activity  through  the  Production  Reporting  module  in  AIM2.  They  also review their Unit Information to ensure it is accurate. 5.7.2.  The BVIM or delegated representative at the unit-level, where more than one activity resides  on  a  base,  accesses  AIM2  and  updates  the  Unit  Information  module  for  MAJCOM leadership review to ensure all units are properly reporting their information. 5.7.3.  MAJCOM VI Managers, or designee, export the  production reports from units under their  command  and  make  the  data  available  to  brief  their  commander  to  demonstrate  VI contributions and efforts. 5.7.4.  AFPAA  exports  the  global  production  numbers  and  briefs  SAF/PA  on  VI contributions and efforts to support the war fighter. 5.7.5.  AFPAA should use the production data to help justify dollars as part of Air Force VI planning, programming, and budgeting functions. 5.8.  Inventories and Automated Information Multimedia Manager.  All units with DVIANs must update equipment inventories and account information in AIM2 and inspect it annually to ensure  accuracy.  (T-1)  Inventory  inspections  are  to  be  completed  by  units  no  later  than  15 September  and  by  MAJCOMs  no  later  than  1  October  annually.  The  inventory  information  is used  by  AFPAA  to  justify  and  prioritize  equipment  purchases  in  the  November  VIEP submission.  Inventory  validation  also  provides  the  basis  for  the  equipment  spend  plan  and  to standardize equipment based on life-cycle replenishment. 5.9.  Classified Processing Requirements. 5.9.1.  Before working with classified information, the installation PA office will contact the wing information protection office to conduct a physical security inspection of PA facilities and equipment, according to AFI 16-1404, Air Force Information Security Program. (T-1) 5.9.2.  Before electronically processing classified information, the installation PA office will contact  the  wing  information  assurance  office  to  ensure  a  TEMPEST  assessment  of  PA facilities and equipment processing classified information is conducted, according to AFSSI 7700 (will become AFMAN 33-286), Air Force TEMPEST Program. (T-1) 5.9.3.  The  BVIM  is  to  ensure  certification  of  imagery  equipment  for  use  aboard  military aircraft,  according  to  AFI  11-202,  Volume  3,  General  Flight  Rules.  A  list  of  equipment certified and approved for use aboard military aircraft is available from AFPAA/AOX. 5.10.  Certification  and  Accreditation  (C&A).  All  Air  Force  IT  hardware  is  procured  IAW AFMAN  17-203  using  applicable  Air  Force  Information  Technology  Commodity  Council enterprise buying programs (https://www.afway.af.mil/). 5.10.1.

DoDI 5040.02 specifies the requirement for the SAF to ensure the availability of aircrew-qualified and equipped COMCAM personnel to support operational missions. It applies to all 3N0X2 and 3N0X5 personnel performing COMCAM aerial photographer (AP) duties with Aviation  Service  Code  (ASC)  9  and  Flying  Status  Code  (FSC)  D  (9D).  AFPAA  manages  this activity  for  all  3N0X2  and  3N0X5  Airmen.  These  COMCAM  aerial  photographers  perform photographic or video documentation as part of an authorized aircrew complement and required for the mission. 7.1.1.  The  description,  Aerial  Photographer,  is  a  generic  term  for  Broadcast  Journalists (3N0X2) and Photojournalists (3N0X5) from the public affairs career field tasked to acquire official imagery in support of DoD operations. 7.1.2.  The  expense  of  initially  and  continually  qualifying  aerial  photographers  mandates  a cost-effective program. AFPAA will ensure training and qualification IAW appropriate aerial photography AFI 11-2-series AFIs (T-1). 7.1.3.  Two  programs  provide  PA  different  levels  of  training  and  capabilities:  Non-CEA aircrew and operational support. 7.1.3.1.  Non-career  enlisted  aircrew  (Non-CEA)  FSC  9D.  The  purpose  of  aircrew-qualified  positions  is  to  provide  COMCAM  aerial  photographers  with  qualifications consistent with other non-CEA members. Individuals must be trained and qualified when they perform full time aerial duties and those duties expose them to extreme danger (i.e. combat, high altitude events, ejection seat aircraft, and open door operations). (T-1). APs must be assigned to UMD positions with aircrew prefixes (X, K or Q) in order to perform the mission in 9D status. (T-1). Examples of aircrew programs include COMCAM-type duties or test and evaluation aerial positions. Note: APs assigned to flight test squadrons are be governed by AFI 11-2FT series. 7.1.3.2.  Operational  Support  FSC  9C.  This  program  provides  leadership  with  minimal AP  or  video  mission  capability  for  infrequent,  noncombat,  or  nonhazardous  missions when  an  aircrew-qualified  individual  is  unavailable  due  to  cost  or  time  factors.  This program  uses  man-month  authorizations  provided  by  HQ  USAF  to  the  MAJCOMs  and distributed to host aviation resource management (HARM) offices.  Members authorized 9C  status  should  contact  the  local  flying  squadron  training  office/stan-eval  office  for required training. 7.1.4.  Only  public  affairs  military  (35P,  3N0X2,  or  3N0X5)  or  civilian  serving  in  a  public affairs  office  and  identified  by  their  HARM  office  as  meeting  mission  requirements  can participate  in  aerial  documentation  operations.  EXCEPTION:  Aerial  qualified  photography or  videography  contractors  required  to  perform  photography  or  videography  duties  aboard Air Force aircraft will comply with AFI 11-401, paragraph 1.10.1.6. 7.2.

VI productions are video products which support the  full  range  of  Air  Force  training,  education,  internal  recruitment,  corporate  communication, and information requirements. 8.1.1.  DoDI 5040.02 and DoDI 5040.07 mandates the Air Force manage VI productions for both historical and retrieval purposes. 8.1.2.  The Air Force video production program consists of managing three elements: video products, video production facilities, and the video production process. 8.1.2.1.  Video products are delineated between what the DoD terms as a "VI Production" and all other video products. 8.1.2.2.  Video  production  facilities  are  the  units  (physical  plant,  human  resources, equipment, etc.) that are specifically designated a “C” DVIAN. The "C" designation also includes  a  "tier"  identification  denoting  size,  scale,  and  level  of  support.  See  DVIAN mandates in Chapter 3, and DVIAN designation codes in attachment 2. 8.1.2.2.1.  MAJCOM  PA  must  designate  a  primary  video  production  facility  to support its command’s requirements. (T-1). 8.1.2.2.2.  The  MAJCOM  PA  is  responsible  for  sustainment  of  this  mission.  A MAJCOM may have the need for more than one video production facility. 8.1.2.3.  The  video  production  process  is  designed  to  provide  access  to  the  information for all who require it, with effective management controls. The process also ensures the removal of non-current products from inventory. 8.2.  VI  Productions  Defined.  For  purposes  of  this  instruction,  VI  Productions  are  be  termed “Audiovisual Productions,” which differ from video documentation in that VI productions are an organized  and  unified  presentation,  developed  according  to  a  plan  or  script,  containing  visual imagery, sound, or both, and used to convey information. An audiovisual production generally is a  self-contained  presentation.  Video  productions  can  be  distributed  in  any  format  (videotape, CD-ROM, DVD, Blu-ray Disc, or electronic via the internet) or optically projected or displayed. 8.2.1.  Audiovisual  Productions.  An  audiovisual  production  requires  specific  handling  in accordance  with  DoDI  5040.02  and  DoDI  5040.07,  Visual  Information  (VI)  Production, including assignment of a Product Identification Number (PIN) as explained in this chapter. 8.2.2.  All  other  video  products  listed  in  subparagraphs  below  require  the  file  name  of  a VIRIN and other mandates (see paragraph 3.5, and Chapter 4). 8.2.2.1.  Public Service Announcements (PSAs), 60 seconds or less, except those outlined in DoDI 5040.02, Enclosure 4. 8.2.2.2.  Command gathering, PSAs created by an Air Force unit, etc.). information  messages  (video  news  releases,  electronic  news 8.2.2.3.  Raw documentation. 44 AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 8.2.2.4.  Edited footage for any mission. 8.2.2.5.  Documentation  of  unedited  speeches  or  presentations  (may  require  items  in paragraphs 8.9., 8.10., and 8.11.). 8.2.3.  Exemptions. See DoDI 5040.02, Enclosure 4, for exemptions to exclusions. 8.2.4.  Video  productions  are  permanent  official  records  that  are  created  and  must  be  life-cycle managed as described in Chapter 9 and in DoDI 5040.02 and DoDI 5040.07. (T-0). 8.2.5.  Each  Air  Force  video  production  must  contain  a  master  production  folder  IAW paragraph 8.6.5. (T-1). 8.3.  Video  Production  Request  Process.  There  are  specific  guidelines  for  the  creation  and caretaking  of  Air  Force  video  productions.  See  Figure  8.1.  for  the  specific  video  production request process, and read the subsequent paragraphs for detailed instructions. AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 45 Figure 8.1.  Video Production Request Process Flow  46 AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 8.3.1.  Air  Force  video  productions  are  created  for  base,  multi-base,  command-wide,  Air Force-wide, and DoD-wide requirements. For Air Force video productions, the servicing host PA  office  provides  guidance  to  the  requestor  to  complete  the  DD  Form  1995,  Visual Information  (VI)  Production  Request  and  Report  and  then  forwards  the  form  to  the  host’s MAJCOM PA office. 8.3.1.1.  The MAJCOM PA office ensures the information is accurate and complete, and validates  the  request.  The  MAJCOM  PA  office  then  determines  if  there  is  a  video production  center  within  the  MAJCOM  that  can  create  the  production.  If  so,  the MAJCOM  PA  office  instructs  its  video  production  center  to  create  it,  and  forwards  the DD Form 1995 to AFPAA for certification and PIN assignment. 8.3.1.2.  If the MAJCOM can't create it, the MAJCOM requests AFPAA to find another video  production  center  to  accomplish  the  project.  AFPAA/AOX  will  coordinate  with other  MAJCOM  PA  offices  and  assign  the  video  production  to  an  available  center  and assign a PIN. (T-1) 8.3.1.3.  Any temporary duty (TDY) or other expenses required for the video production should be paid to the video production center by the requesting organization. 8.3.2.  Prior  to  completion  and  initial  distribution,  the  requestor's  servicing  PA  office facilitates  the  following  in  collaboration  with  the  video  production  center  (also  see paragraphs 9.6. through 9.11.) 8.3.2.1.  The  requestor's  servicing  legal  office  performs  a  legal  clearance  review  of  the final  draft  video  and  any  applicable  legal  documentation,  makes  a  legal  release determination,  completes  the  DD  Form  1995  and  forwards  the  memo  to  the  requestor's servicing PA office. At a minimum, the legal review should verify: 8.3.2.1.1.  The  script  contains  no  copyrighted  material  or  an  exception  to  copyright exists. 8.3.2.1.2.  Releases  for  persons  who  either  appear  in  or  whose  voices  are  used  in  a production,  and  from  persons  whose  minor  children  appear  in  any  production  are obtained. 8.3.2.1.3.  Releases real  estate,  copyrighted  material (trademarks,  labels,  trade  or  brand  names),  or  other  private  property  that  appears  in any production are obtained. for  personal  property, 8.3.2.1.4.  Security clearance has been obtained. 8.3.2.2.  The requestor's servicing PAO must perform a security and policy review of the final  draft  video,  make  a  public  release  determination,  sign  an  attesting  memo,  and forwards both the PA and legal memos to the video production center. The public release determination includes one of the following: 8.3.2.2.1.  It is free of all encumbrances and is cleared for public release. 8.3.2.2.2.  Some public clearance restrictions exist and list of restrictions. 8.3.2.2.3.  It is not cleared for public release and list reasons for nonrelease. AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 47 8.3.3.  The  requestor's  servicing  PA  office  and  producing  video  production  center  should both maintain a distribution list, or electronic version, for each production created for the life of each production. 8.3.4.  The  requestor  of  the  video  production  should  perform  a  currency  review  in collaboration  with  the  video  production  center  no  more  than  three  years  after  the production’s completion. (T-1). 8.3.5.  DoD organizations requesting Air Force video production support coordinate their DD Form 1995 with AFPAA. (T-1). 8.4.  Accessibility.  Through  DVIDS  accessioning,  video  productions  are  made  accessible  to individuals with disabilities in accordance with DoDI 5040.02, DoDI 5040.07, and Section 508 of  the  Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973.  DVIDS  provides  close  captioning  on  all  submitted  video products. Transcriptions for 508 compliance must be checked for accuracy by the accession unit or individual. (T-1) 8.5.  Video Production Restrictions. 8.5.1.  In  addition  to  items  listed  in  DoDI  5040.02  and  DoDI  5040.07,  Air  Force  VI productions must not contain material that: 8.5.1.1.  Show DoD personnel in an unfavorable or undignified situation unless doing so is essential to the production’s message. (T-1). 8.5.1.2.  Is inaccurate or incompatible with Air Force policy or doctrine. (T-1). 8.5.1.3.  Is inconsistent with the Air Force's Alcohol Deglamorization Program. (See AFI 34-219) 8.5.1.4.

Is  copyrighted,  trademarked  or  intellectual  property  without  official  consent from the property owner. (T-0). 8.5.2.  No entity will cut, re-edit, or otherwise alter or reproduce copies of video productions without  permission  of  the  video  production  center.  Requests  for  segments  of  video productions  for  briefings  or  other  productions  must  be  coordinated  through  AFPAA,  the requestor,  and  the  video  production  center.  (T-1).  This  procedure  precludes  inadvertent violation of copyright or legal restrictions. 8.5.3.  Proprietary  Production.  DVIAN-authorized  activities  producing  video  productions must  coordinate  and  obtain  content  review  and  approval  from  the  functional  OPR.  (T-1). This may include, but is not limited to: 8.5.3.1.  Security. 8.5.3.2.  Safety. 8.5.3.3.  Equal opportunity. 8.5.3.4.  Human relations. 8.5.3.5.

Ensures people, facilities, and support are available from the organization and outside resources. 8.6.2.14.  Ensures  an  initial,  validated  distribution  list  with  the  DD  Form  1995  that includes current addresses. 8.6.3.  The  video  production  center  must  keep  a  master  production  folder  for  each  VI production that contains all documents from initial production request and approval through completion  and  distribution  and  forward  a  copy  of  the  production  folder  to  AFPAA.  (T-1) The  video  production  center,  DIMOC,  and  AFPAA  will  maintain  these  folders  throughout the life of the production, until  it  is  deemed obsolete and removed from the inventory. The production folder includes: 8.6.3.1.  A completed and signed DD Form 1995. 8.6.3.2.  An approved script, as recorded. 8.6.3.3.  Initial distribution plans. 8.6.3.4.  Contracts, if applicable, for any element or facet involved in creating the video production. Note: For detail on an entirely contracted video production, which can only be approved by AFPAA, see paragraph 8.7. 8.6.3.5.  Production costs. 8.6.3.6.  A memorandum signed by a servicing legal office attesting to performance of a legal review of the production, and its associated talent and legal releases, if applicable, as  defined  in  paragraph  8.12.  must  be  completed  before  the  PA  security  and  policy review (T-1). 8.6.3.7.

The video production activity should also send a master copy of the video production on DVD or Blue Ray to DIMOC Customer Service Division, Building 3, Room 101, 11 Hap Arnold Blvd, Tobyhanna Army Depot, Tobyhanna, PA 18466-5102. 8.7.  Contracted Video Productions. 50 AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 8.7.1.  No  contracts  for  video  productions  will  be  requested  or  awarded  without  MAJCOM coordination  and  AFPAA  approval.  (T-1)  AFPAA  is  the  final  approval  authority  for contracted  video  productions.  (T-1).  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  servicing  installation Contracting Offices to ensure all customers are aware of this requirement. All efforts must be made to attempt to create the video production with in-house video production centers before considering creating it by means of a contract with a commercial video production business. (T-1).  MAJCOM  PA  offices  and  installation  PA  offices  should  periodically  contact  the appropriate  installation  contracting  official,  usually  contracting  squadron  commanders,  to ensure  they  know  that  the  Air  Force  has  in-house  video  production  capability  available  to satisfy most official video production requirements, and that every effort should be made to ensure  no  duplicate  spending  of  resources.  The  MAJCOM  or  installation  PA  office  should request  the  contracting  squadron  include  a  referral  to  the  installation  PA  office  in  its processes and/or instructions to customers regarding preparation of acquisition packages. 8.7.2.  AFPAA  can  provide  guidance  on  video  production  contracts  and  put  customers  in contact with a specialized VI activity to support Air Force and DoD requirements. 8.7.3.  The MAJCOM PA office reviews video production contract portions and forwards to AFPAA  to  approve  before  the  awarding  of  the  contract.  This  is  to  ensure  the  contractor follows  this  instruction  and  AFI  33-322,  Records  Management  Program,  that  costs  are reasonable, and that the contract does not duplicate existing video production capabilities to ensure  optimum  stewardship  of  taxpayer  dollars.  In  addition  to  current  Air  Force  video production centers, additional existing video production capabilities include: 8.7.3.1.  Research  and  development,  weapon  systems,  and  similar  contracts  when  the production is a provision of the contract for status reporting and new equipment training. interactive  courseware  and 8.7.3.2.  Curriculum  development  contracts  (such  as instructional  systems  development)  when  the  project  needs  a  qualified  curriculum development contractor (rather than an audiovisual producer) unless the video production costs more than 50 percent of the total. 8.7.4.  Video production contracts funded by the Air Force should state that the materials and final VI products and video productions are the property of the Air Force and the Air Force maintains  authority  over  materials.  Contracts  will  include  unrestricted  rights  for  the government to copy and distribute any portion or all of the production. (T-1) 8.7.5.  For  contracts  with  another  service  or  government  agency,  the  servicing  installation contracting officer is to request AFPAA approval before providing support. 8.8.  Copyright  Licenses  or  Trademark  Rights.  Using  copyrighted  or  trademarked  media requires a separate license or explicit permission. Generally, both music and programs recorded from broadcasts are copyrighted. Having the source recording or music score does not confer any right to reproduce, transfer, or otherwise use or perform the recorded material, either as a whole or in part. The installation PA office must discuss with the installation legal office when use of copyrighted  or  trademarked  material  is  in  question  and  receive  specific  clearance  for  each  use from the copyright or trademark owner. (T-1). A clearance may: 8.8.1.  Give the government the perpetual right to duplicate, distribute, publish, exhibit, use, or  transmit  all  or  any  part  of  the  copyrighted  material  in  the  production  that  the  Air  Force received license to use or any future use incorporating part or all of the production. However, AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 51 do not assume perpetual rights. The installation legal office will certify each effort to invoke the fair use provision of the copyright law (T-1). 8.8.2.  State that the conveyed license to  use benefits  the U.S.  Government  and its officers, agents,  servants,  and  employees  acting  in  their  official  capacities  and  any  other  persons lawfully reproducing, distributing, exhibiting, or using a part or all of the production that the Air Force received the license to use. 8.9.  AF  Band  music  collections  are  an  audio  source  for  VI  productions  and  should  be considered.  Band link: can http://www.usafband.af.mil/recordings/. recordings following the be found at 8.10.  Public Release.  Video productions produced or contracted for by the Air Force intended for public exhibition or public release (i.e., anyone outside the DoD) require a PA security and policy  review  and  legal  review  before  release  or  exhibition.  (T-1).  (See  paragraphs  8.10.  and 8.12.) 8.11.  Video  Production  Review.  The  PAO,  or  designated  representative,  will  review  the production and designate it in one of the following categories (T-0): 8.11.1.  Free of all encumbrances and it is cleared for public release. 8.11.2.  Some public clearance restrictions exist. (Provide comments on why the restrictions exist). 8.11.3.  The  production  is  not  cleared  for  public  release.  (Provide  comments  on  why  the productions is not cleared for public release). 8.12.  Air Force Personnel as Performers in Productions. 8.12.1.  Air  Force  personnel,  including  active-duty  military,  only  play  dramatic  roles  or narrate in Air Force video productions when: 8.12.1.1.  They  perform  their  jobs,  and  professional  actors  lack  the  skills  or  knowledge needed to do the jobs. 8.12.1.2.  A  video  production’s  sole  purpose  is  internal  communication  or  training,  and Air Force personnel play roles developed to teach others to do their jobs. 8.12.2.  AFPAA  may  waive  these  performance  restrictions  when  doing  so  results  in  an effective and economic production. 8.12.3.  Government personnel will not perform roles that are more hazardous than their jobs. (T-1). 8.13.  Legal  Release  in  Air  Force  Productions.  DoDI  5040.02  and  DoDI  5040.07  lists  the mandatory  use  of  DD  Form  2830,  DD  Form  2831,  DD  Form  2832,  Release  Granting  the  U.S. Government  Permission  to  Photograph  or  Otherwise  Record  the  Visual  Image  or  Sound  of Private  Property,  and  DD  Form  2833,  Release  Granting  the  U.S.  Government  Permission  to Record and Reproduce Program Material Transmitted by Educational or Commercial Broadcast Stations, when applicable. These forms are available at the Defense Visual Information web site. 8.13.1.  The  requestor  in  coordination  with  the  video  production  center  must  obtain  signed releases from personnel (T-1): 52 AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 8.13.1.1.  Who appear or speak in a production. 8.13.1.2.  Whose minor children, real estate, intellectual or other private property appear in  a  production.  Note:  No  release  is  required  from  active-duty  military  personnel, including cadets or midshipmen of the United States military academies or DoD civilians performing official duties, unless the person is under age 18. 8.13.1.3.  Who have an expectation of privacy, such as: 8.13.1.3.1.  People  shown  in  secluded  situations  rendering  them  readily  identifiable, as opposed to being presented as members of a large crowd. 8.13.1.3.2.  Central figures in a scene regardless of its brevity. 8.13.2.  A release is not needed from: 8.13.2.1.  People involved in newsworthy and public events, where it is deemed plausible that anyone could record them there. 8.13.2.2.  People who are presented as members of a large crowd. 8.13.3.  The intent of the use of public release forms and processes is to protect  the privacy and security of subject individuals, and to protect the legal interests of the government. 8.13.4.  The request for legal review should be requested by the VI production activity or VI contracting activity. This review determines if the production is free of any legal or copyright encumbrances that would preclude public exhibition, sale, and distribution. The legal review includes, but is not limited to: 8.13.4.1.  Music or stock footage copyrights (releases from artists) 8.13.4.2.  Talent releases (actors or narrators) 8.13.4.3.

Purpose.  The  Advanced  Still  and  Motion  Media  Program  provides  Air  Force professionals  with  a  specialized  capability  to  communicate  with  visual,  written,  and  broadcast products  by  attending  an  advanced  program.  The  overall  program  is  managed  by  the  Defense Information  School  (DINFOS)  and  each  of  the  Services  provides  management  of  their participation.  Enlisted  Airmen  trained  by  DoD  or  Air  Force  organizations  understand  how  to create products. Graduates of this program gain a higher understanding of how and why to create products.  They  are  educated,  not  trained,  in  the  art  of  communication.  Their  ability  to  create products that communicate at levels far more thoroughly than their peers makes them invaluable in  communicating  to  internal  and  external  audiences.  Graduates  of  the  program  receive  the special experience identifier (SEI) 332 for photojournalists and 333 for broadcast journalists, and are assigned to positions coded with these SEIs. 10.2.  Responsibilities. 10.2.1.  SAF/PA. 10.2.1.1.  Manages  the  program  and  ensures  the  most  effective  use  of  SEI  332  and  333 Airmen. 10.2.1.2.

Appoints  qualified  field  representatives  to  review  and  rank  submission packages.  Provides  the  selection  list  with  alternates  to  Air  Force  Personnel  Center (AFPC)/DPAA no later than 15 January each year. 10.2.2.  AFPC/DPAA  applies  personnel  policy  to  the  selection  list  provided  by  AFPAA  to determine the most eligible Airmen and provides AFPAA with rationale on non-selection of individuals and waiver guidance if possible or necessary. 10.2.3.  MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs: 10.2.3.1.  Provide  SAF/PA  annual  comprehensive  justification  for  each  SEI  332/333 position within their command. The justification states why  a base-level  photojournalist or  broadcaster  cannot  meet  requirements,  the  individual’s  primary  duties,  position number, grade, organization, office symbol, and contact information. 10.2.3.2.  Ensure  SEI  332/333  individuals’  primary  duties  do  not  mirror  base-level photojournalists  or  broadcasters  but  are instead  used  for  developing  critical communication products, mentoring, or training. 10.2.4.

Managing Contracted Facilities.  Some PA Offices have contracted VI operations. This attachment provides general guidelines for managing contracted operations under the Air Force’s Commercial Activities Program. A4.1.1.  The  OPR  for  all  contracted  operations  is  the  Contracting  Office.  Seek  specific guidance from the host-wing servicing installation Contracting Office for detailed procedures on  managing  a  new  or  existing  contracted  operation.  New  contract  startups  must  be coordinated  with  AFPAA  and  the  host  installation's  MAJCOM  PA  office.  (T-1)  Key considerations for all operations are: A4.1.1.1.  Understand  the  outsourcing  process  by  becoming  familiar  with  AFI  38-203, Commercial Activities Program. A4.1.1.2.  Understand  the  requirements  of  a  Contracting  Officer  Representative  (COR) appointment and the quality assurance mission managing a VI Services contract. A4.1.1.2.1.  Understand the roles and responsibilities of the COR, and the difference between quality assurance versus daily management. A4.1.1.2.2.  Understand  quality  measurements  for  the  contract  (as  stated  in  the contract Service Delivery Summary). A4.1.1.2.3.  Understand  performance type  or  overtime restrictions,  (i.e.,  determine  whether  the  contractor  can  perform  work  off-base, understand what defines the “base area,” what is supported and what will add costs). limitations  and  work A4.1.1.2.4.  Understand which products and services are to be provided, and the need to  ensure  they  are  all  provided.  Any  additional  products  and  services  which  are allowed  to  be  provided,  but  are  not  in  the  written  performance  work  statement  may result in an additional bill from the service provider. A4.1.1.2.5.  Solving  problems  or  issues  which  may  arise.  Follow  established resolution  processes  and  try  to  resolve  at  the  lowest  relationship  level.  Involve  the servicing  installation  contracting  officer  if  problems  or  issues  cannot  be  resolved  at lower levels. A4.1.2.  Originating  a  Visual  Information  Services  Contract.  This  includes  any  contract vehicle  whereby  visual  information,  photography,  video,  graphics,  and/or  audiovisual support  resides  in  any  of  the  proposed  contract  line  item  numbers  (CLINs).  The  following items are key considerations: A4.1.2.1.  Understand how to develop a Statement of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statement (PWS). A4.1.2.2.  Understand the source selection process and the critical need to be involved in it. A4.1.2.3.  Understand the types of contract operations. A4.1.2.3.1.  Government owned, contractor operated. 76 AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 A4.1.2.3.2.  Contractor owned, contractor operated. A4.1.3.  Managing an Existing Visual Information Services contract. The following items are key considerations: A4.1.3.1.  Understand  the  level  and  detail  of  the  current  contract  requirements  by becoming familiar with the SOW or PWS and priorities of the current mission. A4.1.3.2.  Meet  with  the  servicing  installation  contracting  officer  for  the  visual information or PA contract to understand the “history” of performance. A4.1.3.3.  Meet the service provider’s Program Manager (PM). A4.1.3.3.1.  Share philosophy to create a team environment. A4.1.3.3.2.  Share  reputation  management  goals.  All  members  of  the  contract  have direct  customer  contact  that  affects  both  PA’s  and  the  service  provider’s  mutual reputations. A4.1.3.3.3.  Establish a level of open feedback for process and product improvement. The PM can and should solicit inputs from their employees. A4.1.3.3.4.  Be involved in production meetings, when appropriate. A4.1.3.3.5.  Work to improve production process relationships to be as streamlined as possible. A4.2.  VI  Manager/Quality  Assurance  Evaluator  (QAE)  (T-1).  PA  oversees  and  facilitates contracted  VI  centers.  QAEs  evaluate  contract  support  and  are  functionally  qualified  technical experts  in  AFSCs  35PX,  3N0XX,  or  civilian  personnel  in  GS  1000  series.  QAE  missions  are inherently governmental, making resource management and allocation decisions. QAEs must (T-1). A4.2.1.  Be  knowledgeable  of  the  SOW’s  primary  and  secondary  requirements.  Secondary requirements  are  such  things  as  records,  equipment  and  Automated  Data  Processing Equipment  management,  facility  management  if  applicable,  Operations  Security,  EMSEC, etc. A4.2.2.  Develop a plan for providing "Core Support" in case of contract termination for any reason. A4.2.3.  Begin  the  SOW  development  process  with  enough  lead  time  for  coordination through MAJCOM functional representatives. A4.2.4.  Conduct wing wide research soliciting inputs for services or products needed but not available  through  the  current  contract.  Review  and  evaluate  inputs  for  authorization, feasibility and affordability. Strict attention should be given to define “need” versus “want.” What PA provides through the SOW should be based on what base customers need, not what PA wants to provide.  AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 77 Attachment 5 GENERAL GUIDANCE FOR PHOTOGRAPHY, TELEVISION AND/OR VIDEO STUDIO OPERATIONS A5.1.  Requirements. A5.1.1.  Photographic  Studio  .  Each  host  wing  PA  office  must  maintain  and  operate  a photographic studio to support all commanders and units on the installation. (T-1). A5.1.1.1.  Photographic  studio  size  and  configuration.  Photographic  studios  should  be  a minimum  of  400  square  feet  to  accommodate  specialized  lighting,  backdrops, professional  cameras,  furniture  sets  and  imaging  systems  to  process  the  photographic images.  Studios  require  additional  ceiling  height  (minimum  of  15-20  feet)  to accommodate  specialized  photographic  lighting  equipment.  Space  is  also  required  for dressing or changing rooms. Extensive electrical and electronic support for illumination, equipment,  air  conditioning,  and  ventilation  is  required.  Special  fire  detection  and suppression equipment may be necessary. See AFMAN 32-1084. If there is a requirement for classified work, electronic processing of classified materials requires a facility design governed  by  AFMAN  33-283,  Communications  Security  (COMSEC)  Operations.  See Figure A5.3. for a sample studio configuration. A5.1.1.2.  Photographic  Background/Backdrop  and  Lighting.

If VI imagery is to meet the Department of Defense's operational and other needs, PA and COMCAM should focus their efforts on capturing specific imagery, and avoid expending time and resources recording other imagery. The AFDLT helps achieve that goal by providing specific guidance on what imagery should be captured, and the disposition of the products. A6.1.1.  VI provides field and off-site commanders with near real-time visual imagery of the scenes,  facts,  and  occurrences  surrounding  an  event,  mission,  or  operation.  In  so  doing,  VI facilitates mission/operation planning, decision-making, and battle damage assessments. A6.1.2.  For VI imagery to effectively serve commanders, personnel should capture all the VI that the Department of Defense needs, but not repetitious, duplicative, or extraneous VI that does not  meet DoD operational/functional  requirements or the demands of Federal law  and regulations. In this way, camera operators make it easier and less costly for the Department of Defense to manage, store, and disseminate its VI imagery to those who need it as quickly as possible. A6.1.3.  The  AFDLT  includes  four  sections,  each  covering  a  different  broad  scenario  in which PA personnel might be working, since the Department of Defense's operational and VI imagery requirements differ in each stage. These sections are: A6.1.3.1.  Wartime and combat events and operations. A6.1.3.2.  Peacetime military operations and exercises. A6.1.3.3.  Combat  service  support,  preparations  for  military  operations,  unit  security, everyday life-in-the-field, and related activities. A6.1.3.4.  Normal  peacetime  activities  at  the  service,  major  command,  unit,  base,  ship, and installation level. A6.1.4.  Each  section  consists  of  tables  that  contain  both  subject/scene  descriptions  and related instructions, as follows: A6.1.4.1.  The subject/scene descriptions describe the subject matter content and consist mostly of brief category descriptions along with characteristic examples or definitions of the events, phenomena, actions, or activities that fall within the category. A6.1.4.2.  The related instructions contain two types of directions. The first describes the priority  for  the  recording  of  the  subject  matter  listed.  The  second  tells  what  the  camera operators  and  those  higher  in  the  chain-of-command  should  do  with  the  imagery afterward. A6.1.4.3.  Priorities  fall  into  the  following  categories:  HIGH,  NORMAL,  FILE, SAMPLE, SELECT, SAMPLE/SELECT, and LOCAL. A6.1.4.3.1.  HIGH  priority  subject  imagery  has  both  significant  and  immediate operational  value  (and  significant  archival  or  historical  value).  Examples  include engagements  with  enemy  forces  or  rescues  of  injured  and  trapped  victims  from collapsed buildings, damaged aircraft, or other vehicles following a major disaster or 82 AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 accident.  In  most  cases,  there  may  be  major  national  and/or  international  media interest  in  the  material.  Usually,  the  subject  matter  consists  of  unique  limited-time duration  events  that  are  not  repetitive.  PA  personnel  should  make  every  reasonable effort to capture or record these subjects or events. A6.1.4.3.2.  NORMAL  priority  subject  imagery  has  major  operational  value  (and potential  archival  or  historical  value),  but  less  than  imagery  classified  as  HIGH Priority.  Examples  include  the  searching  of  captured  enemy  bunkers  or  facilities, briefings and video reports on joint training exercises, and follow-on deployments of troops, aircraft, and weapons systems to overseas locations. A6.1.4.3.3.  FILE  priority subject  imagery has potentially high operational  value in the  future,  but  not  normally  at  the  time  it  is  recorded.  It  is  the  type  of  imagery  that Area of Responsibility (AOR) commands and others may want to have on file in case there  are  sudden  operational  requirements  for  the  imagery  or  there  is  sudden  public interest.  Examples  include  imagery  of  facilities  or  terrain  where  future  actions  may take place, or imagery showing the routine appearance, configuration, and operation of aircraft, and weapons systems that may be used in future operations or become the subject of major public interest. A6.1.4.3.4.  SAMPLE  priority  subject  imagery  documents  either  long-duration activities or normally repetitive and recurring subjects and events. In such cases, there is  often  a  short-term  operational  (and  normally  local)  need  for  the  material.  Any longer-term  operational  needs  and  beyond  local  or  beyond  AOR  needs  (and  any archival  or  historical  documentation  needs)  may  easily  be  met  by  a  representative sampling  of  scenes  containing  the  subjects  described.  Over  a  long  period  of  time, different  camera  operators,  unless instructed  otherwise,  may  often  generate duplicative and repetitious imagery of the SAMPLE subject material. Consequently, recording of such subjects should have a lower priority than other subject categories, and  only  a  representative  sample  of  such  material  should  be  accessioned.  Examples include  imagery  depicting  routine  logistics,  transport,  medical  support,  and  combat service support activities such as food preparation and mail distribution. A6.1.4.3.5.  SELECT  priority  subject  imagery  documents  scenes  or  subjects  that normally  have  operational  value  (and  archival  or  historical  value)  only  when something atypical or out of the ordinary occurs. These include low probability (but important  if  they  do  occur)  events,  rarely  occurring  but  major  malfunctions,  or detected  changes  or  activity  in  a  normally  static  scene  that  is  under  surveillance. Typically,  much  of  the  material  falling  into  this  category  is  recorded  by  security cameras  or  during  surveillance  or  telemetry  operations.  Sometimes,  however,  an atypical event, malfunction, or change may be recorded by personnel who happens to be  in  the  right  place  at  the  right  time.  Examples  would  include  visual  telemetry recording a major equipment malfunction in a new weapons systems, and surveillance imagery that shows unusual  activity in a normally  inactive area.  In  cases like these, only the unusual or atypical subject material should be accessioned. A6.1.4.3.6.  SAMPLE/SELECT  may be designated in  some categories  of imagery. This means that both a representative or typical sample of normal events or subjects, and  the  out-of-the-ordinary  events  or  malfunctions  or  changes  are  desired.  An AFI35-109  1 JUNE 2017 83 example  includes  both  a  random  sample  of  aircraft  returning  from  combat  missions plus all recordings of returning aircraft that crash-landed due to battle damage. A6.1.4.3.7.  LOCAL  subject  imagery  is  normally  of  just  local  and  temporary operational  (and very little historical  or archival)  value. PA personnel  should record these  subjects  only  to  meet  local  needs  and  only  a  representative  sample  of  such material should be accessioned. Examples would include routine landings of aircraft returning  from  non-combat  missions,  small  unit  training  exercises,  and  local  base open-houses  that  neither  involve  VIPs/high-ranking  officers,  show  newly  acquired facilities or weaponry, nor provoke news media interest.
