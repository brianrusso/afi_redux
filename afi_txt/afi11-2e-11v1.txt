If  at  any  time  during  a  trainee’s  flight instruction, progress is considered unsatisfactory, the responsible Squadron organizes and convenes  a  PRB  to  review  the  trainee’s  record  and  determine  whether  to  continue, modify,  or  terminate  training,  or  conduct  a  Flight  Evaluation  Board  or  Aircrew Evaluation Board.  For procedures during ATS phase (Initial Qualification Training), see Chapter 6. 1.4.5.  Supervisors: 1.4.5.1.  Identify  areas  where  additional accordingly. training is  needed  and  direct training 1.4.5.2.  Ensure training objectives are pre-briefed, debriefed, and evaluated to determine successful accomplishments. 1.4.6.  Individual aircrew members: 1.4.6.1.  Are  responsible  for  completion  of  training  requirements  and  currencies  within the guidelines of this volume. 1.4.6.2.  Are not to participate in flying activities or tasks for which they are not trained, qualified, or current unless under appropriate supervision. 1.5.  Training.  Aircrew  training  is  designed  to  progress  aircrew  from  Initial  Qualification Training  (IQT)  (Basic  Course  or  Requalification  Training  (RQT))  to  Mission  Qualification Training (MQT) and finally to Continuation Training (CT). 1.5.1.  IQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify aircrew in a basic crew position to  perform  flying  duties  without  regard  to  the  unit’s  mission.    See  Chapter  2.    Upon completion of IQT, aircrew attains Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. 1.5.2.  MQT  provides  aircrew  the  advanced  training  necessary  to  qualify  in  an  assigned aircrew position to perform the command or unit mission.  See Chapter 3.  Aircrew remain in a BAQ status until completion of MQT.  Completion of MQT is a prerequisite for CMR status. 1.5.3.  CT  provides  aircrew  with  the  volume,  frequency,  and  mix  of  training  necessary  to maintain proficiency in the assigned qualification level.  See Chapter 4. 1.5.4.  The SQ/CC, using discretion, designates aircrew as CMR upon completion of all unit-specific mission training items 6 AFI11-2E-11V1  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 1.5.4.1.  CMR aircrew maintain proficiency and qualification in all core missions of the flying  unit  to  which  they  are  assigned  or  attached.    Maintain  currencies  which  affect CMR status, by accomplishing all core designated flight training (sorties and events), and all mission ground training. Failure to complete this training or maintain these currencies results in regression to Non-CMR (N-CMR) status. 1.5.4.2.  Unqualified  (UQ).    Unqualified  aircrew  members  require  a  flight  evaluation before progressing to a higher qualification level IAW AFI 11-202V2.  Aircrew members are UQ for one or more of the following circumstances: 1.5.4.2.1.  Enrolled in IQT. 1.5.4.2.2.  Downgraded for a demonstrated lack of ability. 1.5.4.2.3.  Downgraded  for  failure  to  meet  standards  during  a  QUAL  flight evaluation. 1.5.4.2.4.  Downgraded  by  Sq/CC  discretion  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Volume  2,  Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program. 1.5.4.2.5.  Loss  of  currency  exceeding  6  months  (for  currency  items  specified  in Chapter 4). 1.5.5.  Upgrade/Specialized Training.  Upgrade/Specialized training is training in any special skills necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned mission that is not required by every aircrew.  See  Chapter  5.   Upgrade/Specialized training is  normally  accomplished  after  an aircrew is assigned  CMR  status  and  is  normally  in  addition  to  CMR  requirements.    Unless  otherwise specified, CMR aircrew members may gain/retain upgrade/specialized qualifications as long as the prescribed training requirements for those qualifications are met/maintained. 1.5.5.1.  Instructor  Qualified/Evaluator  Certified.    Instructor/evaluator  aircrew  members perform  instructor  and/or  evaluator  duties  associated  with  their  aircrew  positions.  Instructor/evaluator  qualified  aircrew  members  maintain  CMR  status.    Instructors  may perform instructor duties in-flight as long as they are CMR and current in the event they are instructing.   Instructors who become N-CMR may be allowed to  continue academic instructor duties with OG/CC or equivalent approval. 1.6.  Recall Procedures.  Formal requests to recall students from formal training are coordinated through  the  student's  appropriate  chain  of  command  (Wg/CC  or  Division  Chief)  to  HQ ACC/A3CA (or MAJCOM equivalent) and the MAJCOM Contracting Officer for approval and coordination  with  the  training  contractor.    Emergency  recall  during  non-duty  hours  may  be coordinated  directly  with  applicable  training  contractor,  with  follow  up  coordination  with  HQ ACC/A3C and MAJCOM Contracting Officer on the next duty day. 1.7.  Aircrew  Training  System  (ATS)  Contractor.  ATS contractors are currently responsible for  academic  and  aircrew  training  device  (ATD)  instruction.    This  responsibility  includes developing,  updating  and  publishing  courseware  and  the  formal  school  syllabus  in  accordance with the ATS contract. 1.8.  Use of Training Flying Hours.  Normally, no training would be conducted on operational missions.    However,  until  an  E-11  base  of  record  has  been  established  and  the  transition  to  an ACC Program of Record is complete, all crew members will take full advantage of opportunities to accomplish required currency events on operational missions.  Unless specifically prohibited AFI11-2E-11V1  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 7 or restricted by E-11 operating procedures or specific theater operations order, upgrade training may be accomplished on operational missions.  Commanders ensure the training will not impact mission  effectiveness  and  the  crewmember  receiving  training  is  under  the  supervision  of  an instructor. 1.9.  Training Documentation.  Units will use the AF IMT 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew Qualification  Worksheet  as  prescribed  by  AFI  11-202V1  to  update  aircrew  certifications  in Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS). 1.10.  Flight  Examiner  Usage.  Use  flight  evaluators for  any phase of training to  capitalize on their expertise and experience.  If an evaluator is used as the primary instructor for the upgrade sortie  immediately  prior  to  the  evaluation,  the  same  evaluator  should  not  administer  the evaluation. 1.11.  Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements. 1.11.1.  When performing aircrew duties, the following will be under the  direct  supervision of an instructor: 1.11.1.1.  All non-current pilots. (T-1). 1.11.1.2.  All pilots in initial, upgrade or requalification flying training.  (T-1).  Upgrade students  remain  CMR  in  their  current  crew  position  and  may  fly  without  an  instructor when  performing  duties  not  related  to  the  upgrade,  unless  otherwise  restricted  in  this paragraph. (T-1). 1.11.1.3.  All  pilots  performing  restricted  flying  events  listed  on  the  AF  Form  8  as prescribed by AFI 11-202V2. 1.11.2.  Critical  phases  of  flight.    An  instructor  will  be  at  a  set  of  controls  during  critical phases of flight when flying with non-current and/or unqualified personnel. (T-1). 1.12.  Distribution.  Squadrons establish distribution procedures and requirements for this AFI. 1.13.  Information  Management.  HQ  ACC  Aircrew  Operations/Training  Division  (A3T) manages oversight of aircrew information. 1.14.  In-Unit Training Time Limitations  .  E-11 training timelines will be driven by mission requirements but should not exceed 30 days.  Sq/CC has the authority to extend the timelines as required  due  to  extenuating  circumstances.    Pilots  entered  in  a  training  program  leading  to qualification (or requalification) are dedicated to that program on a full-time basis. 1.14.1.  Training time starts with the first significant training event (a training event directly contributing  to  qualification  and  upgrade:  e.g.  ground  training,  flight,  etc.).    Training  time ends with the syllabus completion. 1.14.2.  Training  time  may  be  extended  beyond  thirty  days  but  not  to  exceed  60  days  at Sq/CC's discretion.  Extensions beyond 60 days require MAJCOM/A3 approval.  Notify HQ ACC/A3CA  in  writing  of  Sq/CC  granted  extensions  who  will,  in  turn,  staff  requests  for MAJCOM A3 approval of extensions greater than 60 days.  Extension requests must include training  difficulty  explanation,  unit  corrective  action/strategy  to  resolve  and  prevent recurrence, and estimated completion date. (T-2) 8 AFI11-2E-11V1  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 1.15.  Failure  to  Progress  or  Complete  Training.  If  a  student  fails  to  progress  according  to syllabus  or  training  requirements,  a  Progress  Review  (PR)  will  be  conducted  IAW  AFI  11-202V1  and  the  particular  syllabus/training  plan.  For  failure  to  progress  during  ATS  contractor training, see Chapter 6 of this volume. 1.16.  Aircrew Training Quota Management. 1.16.1.  The Sq/CC (or equivalent) forwards projected PFT/contractor training requirements for  the  next  training  year  to  the  appropriate  MAJCOM  Contracting  Officer  and  HQ ACC/A3CA  training  manager  as  requirements  are  identified.    With  advanced  notice, commercial contractor training capacity is normally sufficient to meet all PFT requirements.  Late requirements may require flexibility on training dates and training times. 1.16.2.  No-shows and late cancellations (outside of individual contract cancellation policies) must  be  explained.    Forward  initial  reports  of  circumstances  to  the  MAJCOM  contract manager, info HQ ACC/A3CA within 24 hours of course start date. AFI11-2E-11V1  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 9 Chapter 2 QUALIFICATION TRAINING (QT) 2.1.  General.  This chapter outlines Qualification Training (QT) of crewmembers into the E-11.  QT can include Initial Qualification Training (IQT) and Requalification Training (RQT). 2.2.  Training  Syllabus.  .    IQT  will  be  completed  via  an  FAA-approved  BD-700  commercial training  course  (See  Chapter  6).    (T-2).    The  course  shall  consist  of  aircraft  general  systems, normal/abnormal/emergency  procedures,  and  flight  simulation.    The  flight  simulations  should allow  pilots  50%  time  in  both  seats.    The  training  is  considered  complete  upon  satisfactory completion  of  an  end  of  course  FAA  equivalent  evaluation.    Completion  of  an  FAA  flight evaluation is required. 2.2.1.  E-11 pilots will not perform IQT in-Squadron in lieu of formal training via the ATS. (T-2). 2.3.  IQT Prerequisites.  Complete initial qualification prerequisites in accordance with AFI 11-202V1 this instruction, and the course syllabus. 2.3.1.  Each  aircrew  member  scheduled  for  training  are  to  provide  endorsement  letters  (e-mail)  to  HQ  ACC/A3CA  signed  by  the  aircrew’s  leadership  (Wg/CC  /  Division  Chief,  or above)  and  Functional  Area  Manager  (FAM),  certifying  the  individual  is  available  for  the required  TDY  and  there  is  no  known  pending  change  (permanent  change  of  station,  rated position identifier code, etc.) that would affect performance as an E-11 crewmember. 2.3.2.  Students must have a valid passport, current DOD Form 2992 (Class 1 medical), and FAA license number prior to attending contract training. (T-2). 2.4.  Ground  Training.  Complete  ground  training  requirements  for  initial  qualification  in accordance with AFI 11-202V1 and this instruction. 2.5.  Difference  Qualification  Training  Requirements.  Difference Training guidance may be found in AFI 11-202V1. 2.5.1.  Difference  Training.  Complete  difference  qualification  training  (DQT)  to  qualify pilots  in  a  different  model  aircraft  within  the  same  Mission  Design  Series  (MDS)  in conjunction with simulator training. 2.5.1.1.  Pilots will meet all initial qualification requirements prior to entering differences training in another model aircraft. (T-2). 2.6.  Requalification Training (RQT).  An aircrew member is unqualified and will accomplish Requalification  Training  upon  expiration  of  the  qualification  evaluation,  loss  of  currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items specified in Chapter 4), or completion of a qualification evaluation  in  a  different  MDS  (Except  when  authorized  multiple  qualification).  (T-2).    The duration  of  unqualified  time  is  from  the  date  the  aircrew  member  became  unqualified  until  the specific retraining start date.  See AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC), for aircrew  training  Active  Duty  Service  Commitments.  See  AFI  11-202V1,  for  additional requalification training limits and requirements. 10 AFI11-2E-11V1  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 2.6.1.  For in-Squadron requalification training, initiate a waiver request with desired course requirements.  (see  paragraph  1.3).    Follow  training  event  requirements  in  the  appropriate requalification  course  syllabus.    Note  in  the  waiver  submittal  all  requested  deviations  from the established syllabus. 2.6.2.  Basic  and  instructor  requalification  may  be  conducted  simultaneously  on  a  case  by case basis.  Initiate a waiver request and include proposed training events to regain instructor status.    When  used,  units  compare  requalification  syllabus  and  instructor  syllabus  and provide  a  recommendation  of  training  events  within  the  request  to  include  an  instructor evaluation. 2.7.  Post  IQT.  On  completion  of  IQT,  pilots  are  designated  a    Basic  Aircraft  Qualification (BAQ)  and  are  qualified  to  perform  E-11  flight  duties  with  the  First  Pilot  (FP)  flight  duty designator  (IAW  AFI  11-401,  Aviation  Management).    Following  IQT,  pilots  are  entered  into mission qualification training (MQT). AFI11-2E-11V1  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 11 Chapter 3 MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT) 3.1.  Description.  This  chapter  establishes  minimum  criteria  and  training  requirements  for mission  qualification  training.    MQT  training  events  are  conducted  at  the  deployed  squadron under  a  formal  syllabus.      Except  where  specifically  stated,  deployed  squadrons  may  arrange mission  sequence  or  sequence  of  items  as  necessary  to  use  flying  hours  effectively  and accomplish the squadron mission. 3.2.  Time Periods for Mission Certification Training.  See paragraph 1.15.  A crewmember will be CMR after completion of all ground training and flying training requirements, MQT, and certification by Sq/CC according to AFI 11-202V1. 3.2.1.  CMR  requirements  are  completed  prior  to  being  deemed  mission  ready.  Normally, these  CMR  sorties  would  be  conducted  on  training  missions  only.    Due  to  the  constraints listed  in  paragraph  3.1  and  paragraph  1.9,  operational  missions  can  be  flown  in conjunction with CMR sorties, providing all ground training items are complete prior to first sortie. 3.3.  Flying Training Requirements. 3.3.1.  BAQ pilots pursuing CMR status will accomplish continuation training requirements.  Upon completion of MQT, the crewmember’s qualification and flight duty designator will be immediately changed via an AF Form 4324 to an MP flight duty designator. 3.3.2.  Local  Area  Orientation.    After  arrival  at  duty  station,  pilots  receive  a  local  area orientation briefing.   This orientation will familiarize pilots with the local flying area, local area flying procedures, and introduce any squadron/mission unique procedures. 3.3.2.1.  Crewmember  are  to  accomplish  all  MQT  required  ground  training  items,  IAW local syllabus, prior to the first training flight. 3.4.  Theater  Indoctrination.  Theater  indoctrination  (M060)  will  be  conducted  according  to AFI 11-202V1, and this instruction. 3.4.1.  Training  should  include  (at  a  minimum)  a  thorough  review  of  theater  unique instrument  requirements  and  procedures,  use  of  non-DoD  instrument  approach  procedures, required instrumentation and navigation procedures for specific approaches, theater weather conditions, local area procedures, and host nation agreements. 3.4.2.  The Sq/CC is responsible for the accomplishment of this training for all assigned and attached pilots and designs a program to meet requirements unique to squadron operations. 12 AFI11-2E-11V1  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT) 4.1.  Description.  This  chapter  establishes  the  minimum  flying  and  related  ground  training requirements to maintain flying currency.  The Sq/CC will ensure pilots conduct sufficient CT to maintain individual proficiency. 4.2.  Waiver  Authority.  OG/CCs  (or  equivalents)  are  designated  as  the  waiver  authority  for requirements mandated within Chapter 4 of this AFI. 4.3.  Aircrew Status.  Pilots are assigned to CMR or N-CMR status. 4.3.1.  Combat Mission Ready (CMR).  A mission-ready crewmember is defined as one who is current, qualified, and certified in the squadron’s mission (completed mission qualification training for applicable crew position). 4.3.2.  Non-Combat  Mission  Ready  (N-CMR).    An  individual  who  is  non-current  or unqualified in the aircraft, has not completed required ground training, or is not certified to perform the squadron mission is a N-CMR crewmember. 4.3.2.1.  If  an  aircrew  member  is  N-CMR  for  failure  to  complete  required  training,  the unit may execute one of two options: 4.3.2.1.1.  Request  a waiver for the  required training in  accordance with  paragraph 4.9.    If  approved,  the  individual  is  then  a  CMR  aircrew  member.    This  should  be accomplished at the earliest opportunity. 4.3.2.1.2.  Place  the  aircrew  member  in  supervised  status.    A  crewmember  that  is placed in supervised status will not fly without an instructor until all required training is accomplished, at the discretion of the OG/CC. 4.4.  Training  Events/Tables.  Standardized  ARMS identifiers  and descriptions  are  referenced  in  Table  4.1  of  this  AFI.    Locally  defined  requirements  will  be designated “X” events and a fifth digit will be added to the standardized identifier. training  requirement   Credit  events  accomplished  on 4.4.1.

Use date of evaluation as the date of accomplishment for all flying training currency events that were successfully accomplished during the formal course evaluation.    Continuation  training  events  accomplished  during  upgrade  training  prior  to  the evaluation  may  be  credited  towards  the  requirements  for  the  current  crew  position.  Upgrading crew  will not  log training  events  that  they  are not  currently  qualified in  prior to the evaluation. 4.4.2.  Unsatisfactory  flight  evaluation.    Unqualified  personnel  will  not  log  Continuation training events until a passing evaluation grade is achieved. 4.4.3.  Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period. 4.4.4.  Documenting  Aircrew  Training.    All  training  events  are  recorded  in  ARMS.  Squadrons may maintain one-time events on the crewmember’s currency report. AFI11-2E-11V1  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 13 4.4.5.  Simulator  Credit  for  Training  Events.    Pilots  may  log  continuation  flying  events accomplished  in  the  simulator  (FAA  certified  Level  D  or  better).    Pilots  may  maintain  or regain currency through events accomplished in the simulator. 4.5.  Ground Continuation Training Requirements. 4.5.1.  Completion and tracking of continuation training is the responsibility of the individual crewmember.    Pilots  should  actively  work  with  squadron  schedulers  and  training  offices  to ensure continuation training is accomplished as described in this chapter. 4.5.2.  Aircrew  (including  Flight  Surgeons)  accomplish  and  maintain  training  requirements IAW Table 4.1.  See paragraph 4.9 to regain CMR status.  Ancillary training events do not affect mission ready status nor restrict pilots from any mission. 4.5.3.  Individuals  are  responsible  for  reporting  all  accomplished  training  to  their  ARMS office. 4.6.  Flying Continuation Training Requirements. 4.6.1.  Initial  Qualification  Training  Graduates.    Pilots  attaining  IQT  status  (designated  for flight duty as a FP) are dual seat qualified, and may accomplish training events in either seat. 4.6.2.  For  ARMS  tracking,  simulator  events  will  be  coded  with  an  “S”  prefix  and  within ARMS use the Restrictions tab under Profile Task Information. 4.7.  Ground  and  Flight  Training  Requirements.  All  pilots  will  complete  the  ground  and flight  requirements  IAW  Table  4.1  prior  to  the  first  flight.  (T-3).    First  takeoffs,  landings  and approaches  will  be  accomplished  in  the  simulator  to  start  the  initial  dates  for  currency requirements.  (T-3).    Note: All training requirements will be logged under program code IA or CL per AFI 11-202V1, Table A2.2.  Exception: Flight Physical and Physiological Training will not be in the training tables and must be current throughout deployment. (T-2). Table 4.1.  Training Table.

Initial assignment of aircraft and UP qualification date on the AF FORM 4324, will be based on Class Start Date (CSD) of ATS simulator training course 5.  If noncurrent for more than 6 months, member is unqualified. 4.8.  Ancillary  Training.  Ancillary  training  is  guidance  or  instruction  that  contributes  to mission accomplishment, but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or occupational series.  In accordance with AFI 11-202V1, the source AFI provides training frequency for these events and requisite waiver authority. 4.9.  Simulator Training. 4.9.1.  Crew  members  on  six  to  twelve  month  deployments  will  complete  a  one  day Emergency Capabilities Training recurrency course at a certified facility.  (T-3)   The course includes  a  minimum  of  two  hours  of  academic  training  along  with  a  four  hour  simulator session. 4.9.2.  Crew  members  on  9-12  month  deployments  will  also  complete  4-5  days  of  BD-700 Recurrency  Training  at  an  approved  FAA  certified  facility.    (T-3).    The  course  includes academic and simulator training. 4.10.  Failure  to  Complete  Training  Requirements.  Crew  members  become  non-current  the day  after  event  currency  expires;  (i.e.,  a  crewmember  that  accomplished  an  event  with  45-day currency expires 46 days after event accomplishment).  The following guidance applies: 4.10.1.  Loss of currency of 6 months or less, a crewmember must demonstrate proficiency in the  aircraft  or  simulator  with  an  Air  Force  instructor  (or  ATS  instructor  for  simulator creditable  events)  in  all  delinquent  items.  (T-2).    Pilots  that  are  non-current  for  up  to  6-months will maintain their current qualification (no documentation required) except for those items that cause loss of qualification according to Table 4.1. (T-3). 4.10.2.  Loss of currency exceeding 6-months but less than 24 months; complete training in all  delinquent  items  (as  applicable),  additional  training  as  directed  by  the  squadron commander,  and  a  requalification  evaluation  IAW  AFI  11-202V2  and  AFI  11-2E-11V2. Attending  an  ATS  requalification  course  and  demonstrating  proficiency  in  the  simulator  to the satisfaction of an ATS instructor in all delinquent item(s) may satisfy this requalification requirement. 4.10.3.  For  a  loss  of  currency  exceeding  24  months,  currency  is  regained  by  attending  an ATS requalification course. 4.10.4.  Failure to Complete Ground Training Events.  The OG/CC or equivalent may waive ground  continuation  training  events  identified  in  Table  4.1.  This  waiver  authority  will  be used  judiciously.    The  decision  to  grant  a  waiver  will  be  based  on  the  individual crewmember’s  experience  and  proficiency  level  (i.e.  waivers  will  not  be  based  on  a crewmember’s  availability).    The  OG/CC  will  determine  the  allowable  time  period  of  the waiver.    The  make-up  training  should  be  accomplished  at  the  earliest  opportunity.    This 16 AFI11-2E-11V1  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 waiver is for unforeseen circumstances only and only for events that will not degrade mission accomplishment. AFI11-2E-11V1  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 17 Chapter 5 UPGRADE TRAINING 5.1.  Description.  This  chapter  identifies  general  prerequisites  and  training  requirements  for upgrade.    Upgrade  Training  will  normally  be  conducted  during  a  formal  syllabus  course  at  an FTU,  however,  until  a  base  of  record  has  been  established  and  the  transition  to  a  program  of record is complete, Upgrade Training can be conducted at the deployed squadron under a locally developed and approved syllabus.  Upgrade prerequisites will be conducted IAW Table 5.1. (T-2) 5.1.1.  The flying time prerequisites for upgrade are based on the crewmember having gained the  knowledge  and  judgment  required  to  effectively  accomplish  the  squadron’s  missions.  The Sq/CC will ensure their continuation training programs emphasize these areas. 5.1.2.  OG/CC  is  designated  waiver  authority  for  flying  hour  prerequisites  for  entry  into formal upgrade courses. Table 5.1.  Upgrade Prerequisite Summary.

Aircraft Commander (MP).  Pilots are designated as aircraft commander upon completion of mission qualification training. 5.4.  Aircrew Instructor Program.  Instructor candidates will be selected based on experience, judgment, ability to instruct, flying skill, and technical knowledge. 5.4.1.  Prerequisites.  See Table 5.1 and this section for instructor upgrade prerequisites. 5.4.2.  Ground Training. 5.4.2.1.  An  instructor  candidate  must  be  thoroughly  familiar  with  and  able  to  instruct aircraft systems and equipment, normal and emergency operating procedures, prohibited maneuvers, and aircraft performance under all conditions of flight.  Instructor candidates will  demonstrate  knowledge  and  instructional  ability  by  organizing  and  conducting ground briefings on a cross-section of subjects from applicable directives. (T-2). 5.4.2.2.  The  instructor  candidate  receives  ground  training  on  training  documentation requirements. 5.4.3.  Flying Training. 5.4.3.1.  Instructor  candidates  may  occupy  either  seat  during  training  IAW  locally developed and approved syllabi. 5.4.3.2.  Instructor  Evaluations  are  conducted  when  training  is  complete.  Instructor candidates demonstrate to a flight examiner their ability to instruct and perform selected maneuvers and items according to applicable directives. 5.5.  Flight Examiner Upgrade.  The Sq/CC will normally identify instructors with prior flight examiner  experience  for  flight  examiner  certification.    Instructors  identified  for  certification  as flight  evaluator  must  possess  satisfactory  knowledge  of  AFI  11-202V2,  AFI  11-2E-11V2,  and applicable MAJCOM supplements.  All flight examiners must be fully qualified instructors. AFI11-2E-11V1  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 19 Chapter 6 AIRCREW TRAINING SYSTEM (ATS) 6.1.  Description.  Currently,  training  contractors  provide  academic,  simulator,  and  technical training to USAF crews operating the E-11 aircraft.  The Air Force conducts flight training and flight  evaluations.    A  designated  FAA  Flight  Examiner  is  acceptable  to  administer  an  Initial Qualification evaluation in the simulator. 6.1.1.  Training is conducted at a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved training center  by  FAA  certified  instructors.    Training  shall  be  to  the  commercial  Airline  Transport Pilot  (ATP)  Type  Rating/Certification  standard.    Difference  training  is  for  the  applicable variants prior to receiving an MP status or operating as the Aircraft Commander of record. 6.2.  Applicability.  As  defined  in  AFI  11-202V1.    The  ATS  is  civilian  contractor  provided aircrew training in concert with Air Force instruction.  This chapter applies to all pilots attending formal  schools  using  ATS  courseware  or  attending  ATS  initial,  upgrade,  or  refresher  training.  Simulator training contracts govern USAF-contractor relationships and obligations and may only be  modified  by  the  contracting  officer.    Squadrons  will  not  levy  additional  requirements  on contractors.    Contact  the  MAJCOM  training  office  with  recommended  changes  to  the  aircrew training program. 6.3.  Crew  Resource  Management  Training.  Aircraft-specific CRM is  presented during pilot mission qualification training and builds on introductory specialized undergraduate pilot training (SUPT) CRM training. 6.4.  Dedicated  Training  Time.  As  defined  in  AFI  11-202V1.    It  is  imperative  that  students complete their training in a timely and uninterrupted manner.  Students in training are dedicated on full-time basis and relieved from duties not directly related to training. 6.5.  Course  Prerequisites.  Each  ATS  course  is  based  on  student  prerequisites  being  met.  Prerequisites  may  include  a  minimum  number  of  flying  hours,  Sq/CC  recommendation,  and completion of applicable training guides. 6.5.1.  FAA  Prerequisites.    When  an  ATP  Type  Rating  Certification  is  allowed  under  the individual contract, the AF student is personally responsible for all FAA prerequisites prior to  the  check  ride  (i.e.  FAA  written  exams).    In  most  cases,  the  USAF  will  not  fund  FAA prerequisite training (i.e. training to remove center line thrust limitations, written tests, etc.). 6.6.  Lesson Objectives. 6.6.1.  Lesson  Objective  Development.    All  objectives  must  meet  FAA  requirements  for individual course certification. 6.6.2.  Lesson Objective Description.  These are subject to changes in the contract. 6.6.3.  Lesson Objective Use.  Instructors and examiners use lesson objectives as a reference document  to  establish  training  and  evaluation  standards.    Submit  recommended  changes through MAJCOM channels. 20 AFI11-2E-11V1  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 6.6.4.  Contractor  Course  Material.    Training  contractors  provide  student  guides,  training guides,  and  appropriate  course  material  in  the  contractor’s  commercial  format.    Each commercial course is certified by the FAA to meet commercial training standards. 6.7.  Course Critique.  Upon completion of training, the contractor provides each student with a copy  of  a  Student  Course  Critique.    Filling  out  this  critique  is  mandatory  for  USAF  students.  The  contractor  will  scan  and  email  the  critiques to  the  HQ  ACC  training  managers.    HQ  ACC training managers review 100% of student critiques for training quality assurance. 6.8.  Unsatisfactory Student Progress. 6.8.1.  If  a  student’s  training  progress  is  unsatisfactory,  the  contractor  notifies  the government  representative  (group training,  operations  officer,  etc.)  of  a  student’s unsatisfactory progress through established reporting processes.  Following a joint Air Force and ATS contractor review of the student’s record, the Air Force conducts an assessment to determine whether to continue or terminate training. 6.8.2.  The  contractor  will  provide  written  feedback  to  the  Sq/CC  or  training  office  for students who display substandard performance. 6.8.3.  Remediation  Procedures.    HQ  ACC/A3C  must  receive  prompt  notification  from  the contractor  of  failed  course  completion.    Remediation  subsequent  to  a  failed  course  may  be ATS  contractor’s  responsibility,  Air  Force’s  responsibility,  or  a  joint  responsibility, depending on the nature of failure.   In every case, close coordination is required to achieve maximum  trainee  progress.    Direct  contact  with  appropriate  ATS  instructor  supervisor  is encouraged. 6.9.  Scheduling.  Student  scheduling  for  academic  and  simulator  training  classes  will  be  IAW the terms of the individual training contract. 6.9.1.  In  the  event  agreement  cannot  be  reached  on  scheduling  of  a  class  or  classes,  the matter shall be referred to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 6.9.2.  Training contracts have a specific lead time requirement to either schedule a training class  or  to  cancel  a  scheduled  class.    Understanding  the  contractor’s  cancellation  policy  is critical.  Failure to meet a cutoff date could lead to the Government paying for training not received.  ROWAYNE A.
