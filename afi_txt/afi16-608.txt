General. 1.1.1.  This document is UNCLASSIFIED. 1.1.2.  Strict  adherence  to  the  NST  requirements  and  use  of  standard  operating procedures for NST activities is paramount. 1.1.3.  The  NST  and  its  associated  Protocol  and  Annexes  are  the  primary  references  for addressing  questions  related  to  compliance.  In  cases  where  clarification  will  be  required, guidance  will  be  requested  from  Headquarters  Air  Force  (HAF)  Strategic  Stability  and Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Policy Division (A10S). Units at all levels will  adhere  to  NST  requirements.  (T-0;  see  AFI  33-360,  Table  1.1,  for  Tier  approval information). 1.1.4.  This guidance describes processes, provides procedural guidance, and specifies HAF, Major  Command  (MAJCOM),  and  unit  responsibilities  for  implementation  of  and compliance with the NST. This includes coordination and execution of inspections, training, financial oversight, reporting, and use of assets and personnel. 1.1.5.  The NST-declared Air Force facilities referenced in Tables 1.2 and 1.3 are subject to NST inspections. 1.1.6.  Affected MAJCOMs (see paragraph 3.2.) will develop supplements, implementation, or compliance plans and procedures to execute this guidance, and will coordinate plans and procedures with AF/A10. 1.2.  Introduction. 1.2.1.  The  NST  entered  into  force  on  5  February  2011  and  has  a  duration  of  ten  years.    It may be extended for a period of no more than five years by mutual agreement of the Parties. 1.2.2.  The  purpose  of  the  Treaty  (e.g.,  NST)  is  to  increase  transparency  and  mutual  trust, enhance  predictability  and  stability,  and  reduce  and  limit  the  strategic  offensive  arms  and associated warheads of  both  the United States and the Russian Federation.   The items  that are  considered  to  be  “strategic  offensive  arms”  for  purposes  of  the  Treaty  are  specifically listed  in  the  Treaty.    "Offensive"  forces  contrast  with  those  that  are  “defensive”  in  nature, such  as  ballistic  missile  defense  systems.    The  Treaty  requires  the  Parties  to  mutually  and transparently reduce their nuclear forces over a period of seven years but allows each Party the flexibility to determine the structure of its own strategic forces within the aggregate limits of the Treaty. 1.2.3.  The NST requires each Party to reduce and limit its intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)  and  ICBM  launchers,  submarine-launched  ballistic  missiles  (SLBMs)  and  SLBM launchers,  heavy  bombers,  ICBM  warheads,  SLBM  warheads,  and  heavy  bomber  nuclear armaments,  so  that  seven  years  after  entry  into  force  of  the  Treaty  and  thereafter,  the aggregate numbers, as counted in accordance with Article III of the Treaty, do not exceed: 1.2.3.1.  700 deployed ICBMs, deployed SLBMs, and deployed heavy bombers; AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 5 1.2.3.2.  1550 warheads on deployed ICBMs and SLBMs and nuclear warheads counted for deployed heavy bombers; 1.2.3.3.  800  deployed  and  non-deployed  ICBM  launchers,  deployed  and  non-deployed SLBM launchers, and deployed and non-deployed heavy bombers. 1.2.4.  The  first  and  second  aggregate  limits  are  intended  to  limit  the  deployed  strategic forces of each Party. Deployed delivery vehicles are ICBMs in launchers, SLBMs in launch tubes,  and  nuclear-equipped  heavy  bombers.  The  third  central  limit  is  intended  to  limit  the ability to “break out” of the Treaty limits by constraining the number of non-deployed ICBM and SLBM launchers and non-deployed heavy bombers. Non-deployed launchers are empty ICBM and SLBM launchers and test silos, and non-deployed heavy bombers are test heavy bombers and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments located at repair or production facilities. 1.2.5.  Air  Force  warheads  counted  against  the  aggregate  limits  of  the  Treaty  include  all reentry  vehicles  (nuclear  and  conventional)  emplaced  on  Minuteman  III  (MM  III)  ICBMs. Each deployed heavy bomber counts as a single warhead toward the NST aggregate limit. 1.2.6.  Existing  weapons  systems  are  to  be  operated  in  a  manner  consistent  with  NST obligations.  The HAF shall ensure operations are accomplished in a Joint manner to support the Commander, US Strategic Command and to ensure that the number of accountable items remain within the NST central limits. (T-0). 1.3.  New START Treaty Verification. 1.3.1.  Verification  of  the  NST  is  carried  out  using  on-site  inspections,  national  technical means (NTM), unique identifiers (UID), data exchanges, and notifications. 1.3.2.  On-Site Inspections.  Each Party may conduct up to 18 on-site inspections each treaty year. These inspections are divided into two types. 1.3.2.1.  Type  One  Inspections.    Type  One  inspections  are  conducted  at  ICBM  bases, submarine bases, and air bases. The purpose of such inspections shall be to confirm the accuracy  of  declared  data  on  the  numbers  and  types  of  deployed  and  non-deployed strategic  offensive  arms  subject  to  the  Treaty;  the  number  of  warheads  located  on deployed ICBMs and deployed SLBMs; and the number of nuclear armaments located on deployed  heavy  bombers.  Each  Party  is  allowed  to  conduct  up  to  ten  Type  One inspections each treaty year. 1.3.2.2.  Type  Two  Inspections.    Type  Two  inspections  are  focused  on  non-deployed strategic arms and conducted at facilities such as storage sites, test ranges, and conversion or  elimination  facilities  (a  listing  of  the  facilities  subject  to  Type  Two  inspections  is contained in Section VII of Part Five to the Protocol to the NST and should be consulted prior  to  a  Type  Two  inspection).    The  purpose  of  Type  Two  inspections  shall  be  to confirm the accuracy of declared data on the numbers, types, and technical characteristics of  non-deployed  strategic  offensive  arms  subject  to  the  Treaty  and  to  confirm  that strategic offensive arms have been converted or eliminated.  In addition, each Party shall have the right  to  conduct  inspections at  formerly declared facilities, which are provided for in Part Two of the Protocol to the Treaty, to confirm that such facilities are not being 6 AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 used  for  purposes  inconsistent  with  the  Treaty.  Each  Party  is  allowed  to  conduct  up  to eight Type Two inspections each treaty year. 1.3.3.  National Technical Means.  In addition to inspections, the Treaty authorizes the use of NTM (e.g., reconnaissance satellites) to monitor compliance with treaty provisions. The NST precludes  Parties  from  interfering  with  NTM  or  using  methods  of  concealment  that  might impede verification via NTM. 1.3.4.  Unique  Identifiers.    Each  deployed  and  non-deployed  ICBM,  SLBM,  and  heavy bomber subject to the Treaty is required to be labeled with a unique alpha-numeric identifier visible to the inspecting Party. 1.3.5.  Notifications  Concerning  Data  Pertaining  to  Strategic  Offensive  Arms.      Each  Party must provide updated data for each category of data contained in Part Two of the Protocol no later than 30 days after the expiration of each six-month period following the entry into force of the Treaty. Additional notifications may be required under certain circumstances. Consult the  Treaty,  AF/A10,  and/or  the  servicing  legal  office  for  questions  concerning  notification requirements. 1.4.  New START Treaty Accountable Systems and Facilities. 1.4.1.  Air  Force  facilities  directly  affected  by  the  NST  include  those  designated  as  NST points  of  entry  (POE),  ICBM  Bases,  Air  Bases,  Storage  Facilities,  ICBM  Repair  Facilities, Conversion or Elimination Facilities, Test Ranges, and Formerly Declared Facilities (FDF). The NST also indirectly impacts other declared facilities. Air Force weapon systems directly impacted by the NST include ICBMs, ICBM launchers, and heavy bombers. 1.4.2.  Article  III  of  the  NST  lists  existing  types  of  strategic  offensive  arms  at  the  time  of treaty  signature.  Since  then,  the  Air  Force  has  removed  some  systems  from  accountability. Table  1.1  below  lists  accountable  Air  Force  weapons  systems  as  of  the  date  of  this  AFI publication. Notifications required by the NST apply to all B-52H heavy bombers, regardless of equipage. Table 1.1.  Existing Types of Accountable Air Force Weapons Systems*. Minuteman III (MM III) ICBM B-52H Heavy Bomber Equipped for Non-Nuclear Armaments** B-52H Heavy Bomber Equipped for Nuclear Armaments B-2A Heavy Bomber Equipped for Nuclear Armaments * The Minuteman II (MM II) ICBM, Peacekeeper (PK) ICBM, B-52G heavy bomber, and B-1B heavy bomber were initially listed as existing types, but are no longer accountable under the Treaty.  Although B-1B heavy bombers no longer count toward the Treaty limits, they remain subject to Type Two inspections.  **B-52H heavy bombers equipped for non-nuclear armaments no longer count towards Treaty limits; however, they remain subject to Type One inspections IAW the Third Agreed Statement and Type Two inspections  AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 7 1.4.3.  At  entry  into  force  (EIF),  the  Air  Force  declared  14  facilities  subject  to  on-site inspections  under  NST.  The  original  list  of  14  facilities  has  since  been  revised  to  the following: 1.4.3.1.  Table 1.2 lists Air Force facilities currently subject to Type One inspections. It is possible that changes to this facility list have occurred since the publication of this AFI.  If there are questions about facility status, or for an up-to-date list, contact AF/A10S.

The  Air  Force  General  Counsel  (SAF/GC)  shall  provide  legal  advice  to  HAF regarding NST implementation and compliance activities and coordinate this advice with the Air Force Judge Advocate General (AF/JA) as appropriate. 2.2.10.  The  Director  of  Public  Affairs  (SAF/PA)  shall  interface  with  the  Department  of Defense Office of Public Affairs and provide requested support as necessary to DoD and Air Force public affairs  and  strategic  communications actions relative to the implementation of and compliance with the NST. 2.3.  Waiver Authority.  When complying with official policy, guidance, and/or procedures, the unit may request a waiver. The fundamental aim of a waiver is to enhance mission effectiveness at  all  levels,  while  preserving  resources  and  safeguarding  health  and  welfare.  When  a commander approves a waiver, the commander is communicating to subordinates and superiors that the commander accepts the risk created by non-compliance. Each requirement mandated for compliance  at  the  wing-level  found  within  this  instruction  is  tiered,  signifying  the  appropriate waiver authority to the requirement (i.e., T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3). See AFI 33-360 paragraph 1.9 for waiver process and a detailed description of the standardized waiver authority levels. 14 AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 Chapter 3 MAJCOM & WING COMMAND RESPONSIBILITIES 3.1.

Serve as the focal point for NST matters as they affect the MAJCOM. 3.3.1.8.  Develop  contingency  plans  to  ensure  NST  inspector  rights  guaranteed  by  the Treaty  are  executable  under  furlough,  sequestration,  or  possible  government  shut  down periods.  These  contingency  plans  would  include  alternatives  to  ensure  transportation, billeting, dining, medical, and full access to all inspectable areas is still available. 3.3.1.9.  Ensure  standardized  compliance  procedures  throughout  their  command  and maintain and review subordinate wing/unit compliance plans. 3.3.1.10.  Ensure  all  existing  and  future  contracts  involving  storage,  production, movement,  modification,  or  elimination  of  NST accountable  items,  to  include  reporting requirements,  are  compliant  with  the  NST.  Any  contract  found  to  be  deficient  will  be modified as soon as possible. 3.4.  MAJCOM Inspection Responsibilities. 3.4.1.  Each MAJCOM must have a 24-hour point of contact for NST notifications. 3.4.2.  MAJCOM  TCOs  will  keep  AF/A10S  and  MAJCOM  Operational  Security  (OPSEC) informed of any activity at inspectable Air Force facilities that could impact NST activities (e.g.,  runway  closures,  air  shows,  major  exercises/operations  that  impact  OPSEC,  ramp space, billeting challenges). 3.4.3.  If  present  during  an  inspection,  MAJCOM  treaty  personnel  primarily  serve  as observers  and  shall  not  interfere  with  wing/unit  TCO  or  DTRA  escort  team’s  role  in  the treaty compliance process. 3.4.4.  MAJCOM TCOs have a current understanding of existing USG, DoD, and Air Force positions/guidance relating to the hosting of NST activities on US territory. 18 AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 3.4.5.  If questions arise, the MAJCOM TCO should coordinate with their chain of command and/or  AF/A10S  for  clarification.  The  MAJCOM  TCO  advises  the  wing/unit  TCO  with responses to communicate to the DTRA Escort Team Chief. 3.4.6.  Identification and prevention of any prohibited activity when the DTRA Escort Team and Russian inspection team members are at an inspectable Air Force facility during an NST escort  mission  is  in  accordance  with  USG,  DoD  and/or  Air  Force  guidance  and  is  the responsibility of the DTRA Escort Team, supported by the wing/unit TCO, in direct support of treaty compliance. 3.4.7.  The  MAJCOM  TCO  shall  promptly  notify  his/her  chain  of  command,  including AF/A10S,  of  any  prohibited  activity  reported  by  his/her  wing/unit  TCOs  during  NST activities  at  inspectable  Air  Force  facilities,  the  circumstances  of  those  activities,  and  the resultant actions taken. 3.5.  MAJCOM Arms Control Training and Awareness. 3.5.1.  MAJCOM  TCOs  will  ensure  subordinate  wing/unit  TCOs  and  MAJCOM  personnel receive  appropriate  NST  training  if  directly  involved  in  NST  implementation  and compliance.    Examples  of  appropriate  NST  training  include  attending  the  Air  Force  Arms Control Overview Course, the ACES-NST Initial User training course, Air Force-level NST workshops,  and  MAJCOM-level  arms  control  workshops,  as  well  as  using  the  AF/A10S Portal Training site and participating in US-only mock inspections and training visits. 3.5.2.  MAJCOMs  conduct  mock  inspections  and  training  visits.  US-only  mock  inspections are valuable training activities for the escort mission teams, local base personnel and logistics support activities as well as those personnel involved in the notification process. 3.6.  MAJCOM Resource Management Responsibilities. 3.6.1.  MAJCOM TCOs function as resource managers and monitor arms control funding and manpower. Successful execution requires close coordination between MAJCOM TCOs, base TCOs,  and  appropriate  financial  management  counterparts.  Budgeting  and  manpower requirements  differ  from  base  to  base  and  MAJCOM  to  MAJCOM.  Effective  resource management is necessary to ensure sufficient funding and proper program execution. 3.6.2.  MAJCOM TCOs act as command resource managers for PE 35145F. 3.6.3.  Resource  managers  are  responsible  for  managing  resources  and  budgeting  funds  for MAJCOM arms control activities and ensuring MAJCOM wing requirements are included in budget submissions. The MAJCOM treaty office and FM work with the field units to build a Spend  Plan.  Spend  plans  must  include  Official  Representation  Funds  (ORF)  requirements. ORF requirements are passed to the HAF PEM in the fiscal year prior to execution. In turn, the HAF PEM designates PE 35145 funds for ORF purposes with the Assistant Secretary of the  Air  Force,  Financial  Management  &  Comptroller  (SAF/FM).  The  funds  will  be distributed to the wings via the Wing Protocol offices. 3.6.4.  AF/A10S  approves  the  MAJCOM  Spend  Plan  by  validating  the  NST  requirements within the Air Force arms control budget. 3.6.5.  MAJCOM  TCOs  must  ensure  that  all  subordinate  wing/unit  requirements  are identified and defended, when necessary, and then submitted to A10S. AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 19 3.6.6.  MAJCOM  TCOs  must  also  ensure  that  all  requirements  comply  with  fiscal requirements in the DoD Financial Management Regulation (FMR) 7000.14-R V5, AFI 65-601 V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, and AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds. 3.6.7.  MAJCOM  TCOs  are  responsible  for  monitoring  manpower  authorizations  and identifying  requirements.  Most  wing,  some  MAJCOM,  and  other  arms  control  billet authorizations are centrally managed by AF/A10S. These billets are not under the control of MAJCOM  planners.    Moving  or  reclassifying  a  billet  requires  coordination  with  and concurrence  from  AF/A10S.  In  accordance  with  AFPD  16-6  and  AFI  16-601,  MAJCOM planners  must  identify  arms  control  requirements  to  AF/A10S  sufficient  to  support MAJCOM headquarters and subordinate wing/unit arms control requirements. 3.7.  General Wing/Unit Treaty Responsibilities. 3.7.1.  Wing/unit  TCOs  serve  as  NST  notification  releasing  authority  and  ensure  unit-originated  NST  notifications  comply  with  all  Treaty  requirements  and  are  of  the  highest quality  with  regard  to  accuracy  and  timeliness.  The  TCOs  will  determine  local  roles  and responsibilities  for  preparation  and  transmission  of  NST  notifications.  These  should  be documented in the local NST Compliance Plan. 3.7.1.1.  All  newly-assigned  personnel  whose  duties  include  the  preparation,  review  or transmission of NST notifications must receive local  ACES training NLT 90 days from being  assigned  and  complete  the  NST  Notification  Training  Course  within  180  days  of assignment. (T1). After the initial local ACES instruction, newly assigned personnel can request an ACES training account, but will not process notifications without supervision (by an individual who has completed formal ACES training) until completing the formal ACES-NST  Initial  User  Course.    Every  effort  should  be  made  to  complete  this  formal training as part of a controller's initial training program, prior to certification. 3.7.1.2.  TCOs must maintain proficiency in NST Reporting and ACES operation(s) and take  steps  to  ensure  that  personnel  originating  notifications  at  the  Wing/Unit  have  a working  knowledge  of  NST  notification  requirements  and  procedures.  (T-2).  See  NST Reporting Handbook for proficiency requirements. 3.7.2.  Each wing/unit  that hosts an NST inspectable facility will have an NST Compliance Plan  applicable  to  all  NST  inspectable  facilities  on  the  installation.  (T-0).  The  NST Compliance Plan is  submitted to  the parent  MAJCOM, and the MAJCOM will provide the plan to AF/A10S for review. Air Force facilities declared under the NST that are not subject to on-site inspections or any NST reporting requirements do not require a compliance plan. 3.7.3.  The wing/unit NST Compliance Plan shall detail the logistics support to facilitate NST inspection activities to ensure all NST timelines are met. (T-2). Suggested components of a wing/unit NST Compliance Plan are contained in Attachment 2. 3.8.  Wing/Unit Exhibition Responsibilities. 3.8.1.  Units hosting NST Exhibitions  shall conduct  a mock  exhibition in coordination with AF/A10S prior to the actual exhibition. (T-2). 3.8.2.  Local  units  shall  provide  support  for  digital  photography  to  meet  NST  Exhibition photography requirements in  paragraph 3, section 3, Part Eight  of the Annex on  Inspection Activities. This support must include the ability to print photographs as directed. (T-0). 20 AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 3.9.  Wing/Unit Inspection Responsibilities. 3.9.1.  Wing Commanders will ensure Russian inspection teams are afforded their full treaty rights under NST while protecting US national security interests. (T-0). 3.9.2.  The Wing/Unit TCOs are responsible for facilitating DTRA Escort Teams in fulfilling inspection  obligations.  (T-2).  This  involves  coordination  from  a  variety  of  supporting activities  such  as:  Base  Ops,  transportation,  dining  and  billeting,  force  protection,  security and  OPSEC  PM  and  unit  OPSEC  Coordinators,  aircraft  services  (e.g.,  fuel,  water,  air,  de-icing,  lavatory,  flight  meals,  parking),  protocol  and  public  affairs,  medical  and  recreational services,  meeting/conference  rooms  and  communications  availability,  and  escorting.  Host unit local activities are outlined further in paragraph 6.5. 3.9.3.  Wing/Unit  TCOs  should  work  closely  with  their  base  functional  points  of  contact (POCs) to identify possible problems and recommend solutions. 3.9.4.  Wing/Units  shall  make  every  effort  to  ensure  compliance  with  applicable  treaty timelines. 3.9.5.  Wing/Unit  TCOs  should  keep  the  MAJCOM  informed  of  major  base/community events  that  could  impact  NST  inspection  operations  as  soon  as  possible.  Airfield maintenance,  air  shows,  exercises,  inspections,  weather  events  (e.g.,  hurricane  staging support),  etc.,  may  limit  transportation  options,  support  personnel  availability  and  billeting availability and can affect the ability to host NST activities. 3.9.6.  Each wing/unit must have a 24-hour point of contact for NST notifications. (T-1). The NST inspection activities, by treaty design, are typically short-notice events. TCOs may only have  24  hours  notification  or  less  that  they  are  required  to  host  a  Russian  inspection  team.  Routine  training  of  escorts  and  awareness  briefings  for  wing  leadership  are  a  key  to  the success of the event. 3.9.7.  Upon site designation, the Unit TCO receives a call from the DTRA Escort Team. The Unit  TCO  shall  provide NST-required  information  to  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief  on  the number  of  accountable  items  located  at  the  inspection  site  and  additional  logistical information (e.g., arrival time). (T-0) 3.9.8.  No  later  than  one  hour  after  designation  of  the  inspection  site,  the  designated  unit’s TCO shall ensure that all applicable NST pre-inspection restrictions are implemented. (T-0). The  TCO  shall  notify  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief  immediately  if  any  pre-inspection restriction cannot be fulfilled or sustained. (T-0). 3.9.9.  Upon arrival at the airfield associated with the inspection site, the inspected unit shall provide local escort support to the DTRA escorts. (T-1). 3.9.10.  The  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief  serves  as  the  official  NST  national  escort  and  is empowered to interact directly with Russian inspectors.  The TCOs support the DTRA Escort Team  by  providing  inspection-related  subject  matter  expertise  and  ensuring  Air  Force policies  and  weapons  system  safety  rules  are  observed.  Local  escort  support  is  outlined further in Chapter 6.6. (T-1). 3.9.11.  The  unit  TCO  shall  complete  a  pre-inspection  briefing  for  the  Russian  inspection team within one hour of the team’s official arrival at the inspected facility. (T-0).  The TCOs shall ensure this briefing provides all NST-required information  IAW Para 14, Sect V, Part AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 21 Five  of  the  Protocol  of  the  Treaty  including  annotated  site  diagrams  and  includes  the information required to be provided to the national escorts. (T-0). 3.9.12.  The unit TCO, in coordination with the DTRA Escort Team Chief, shall ensure that Russian inspectors and their DTRA escorts are transported to items designated for inspection within the timeframes specified in the NST. (T-0). 3.9.13.  The  unit,  in  coordination  with  the  DTRA  Escort  Team,  shall  provide  continuous escort of Russian inspectors. (T-1). 3.10.  Wing/Unit Education, Training and Exercises. 3.10.1.  Education,  training,  and  mock  inspection  activities  should  thoroughly  prepare facilities for NST inspection activities. Base TCOs should strive to make these activities as “real”  as  possible,  taking  time,  manpower,  cost,  and  mission  team  requests/desires  into consideration.  They  should  focus  on  the  timeline  for  the  event,  providing  a  timely  and accurate pre-inspection briefing, and focus on facility and escort responsibilities, and safety. TCOs  should  also  coordinate  with  the  OPSEC  PM  who  accomplishes  a  wing/unit impacts/vulnerabilities assessment. 3.10.2.  Unit TCOs shall develop and maintain facility training programs that are flexible and applicable to specific unit needs and requirements. (T-2). 3.10.3.  Unit TCOs will provide escort training sufficient to cover ALL requirements for the NST activities for their installation. (T-2). This training will be submitted to the appropriate MAJCOMs and provided to AF/A10S for review. 22 AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 Chapter 4 REPORTING 4.1.  General. 4.1.1.  Reporting is closely linked to database maintenance and notifications within the NST. This  requires  careful  tracking  of  deployed  and  non-deployed  Air  Force  treaty-accountable assets and scrupulous reporting. 4.2.  Notifications. 4.2.1.  MAJCOMs and Direct Reporting Units (DRUs) shall provide notifications IAW Part Four  of  the  Protocol  and  the  Annex  on  Notifications  to  the  AFCN  via  ACES.  (T-1).  Most notifications are passed between the Parties through the established Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers.  NST  has  four  notifications  in  the  Annex  to  be  employed  by  inspectors  while  in-country conducting inspections. These are passed from the inspectors to the DTRA national escorts. In addition, NST contains provisions for the Parties to address situations where there are  no  pre-established  notifications.  Should  such  situations  arise  during  the  course  of  an inspection on an Air Force installation, whether initiated by the Russian inspectors or at the behest  of  the  unit,  to  address  it  through  the  established  command  channels  and  escalation processes. 4.3.  Database Reporting. 4.3.1.  The NST establishes a database of information concerning items of accountability that the  Parties  exchange  twice  annually  in  March  and  September,  based  on  data  effective  1 March  and  1  September.  Wings/units  will  process  NST  notifications  through  the  ACES reporting network. (T-1). 4.3.2.  Prior  to  this  exchange,  all  wings/units  who  own/possess  and  have  responsibility  for MMIII first stages identified in Tables 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 will conduct a physical inventory of all non-deployed MMIII first stages stored at their facility within 15 days of the semi-annual data exchange. This requirement does not apply to deployed MMIII first stages. Inventories will verify the UID against the NST database. (T-1). 4.3.2.1.  These  inventories  will  be  checked  against  the  unit’s  NST  database  and  then forwarded  to  the  AFCN,  either  directly  or  per  MAJCOM-directed  process,  for  a  final check before the semi-annual NST data exchange. (T-2). 4.3.3.  In  addition,  some  NST  notifications  require  concurrent  reporting  through  separate channels  to  support  distinct  but  complimentary  databases.  USSTRATCOM’s  Force Status/Readiness  (FSR)  database  is  one  such  system.  As  such,  the  TCO  and  local  FSR representative  will  coordinate  to  ensure  that  NST  force  status  changes  for  their  unit  are reflected  in  the  same  manner  in  both  ACES  and  the  FSR  NST  module,  consistent  with established reporting procedures. (T-1). 4.3.3.1.  TCOs will establish FSR accounts, and will verify the accuracy of the FSR NST module  data  for  their  unit  within  24  hours  of  an  NST-reportable  movement/event  that changes  the  deployed/non-deployed  status  of  a  strategic  delivery  vehicle.  (T-1).  If  this movement/event is outside normal duty hours, the TCO will conduct the check the next AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 23 duty  day.  If  mismatches  are  noted,  the  TCO  will  immediately  coordinate  with  the  FSR representative to determine if corrective actions are needed. 4.4.  Treaty Compliance Officer Reports. 4.4.1.  Post-inspection reports by the unit TCO shall be prepared within seven days following an  inspection,  exhibition,  or  demonstration.  (T-2).  The  TCOs  will  forward  these  reports through the MAJCOM to AF/A10S, who will distribute as necessary. (T-2) 4.5.  Treaty Compliance Certifications. 4.5.1.  From  time-to-time  the  Secretary  of  Defense  may  request  Air  Force  certification  of compliance  with  NST.  Such  requests  are  subsequently  sent  to  all  MAJCOMs.  Each MAJCOM will certify  command compliance with  NST. Certifications are sent  to  AF/A10S who will compile them with  other required certifications from  SAF/AQ  and SAF/AAZ and combine them into an Air Force certification. The AF/A10 will certify Air Force operational and acquisition compliance with NST in response to the Secretary of Defense. 4.6.  NST Reporting Deviations. 4.6.1.  A  reporting  deviation  is  identified  as  providing  incorrect  information,  or  failing  to provide the required information, in an NST notification format. An example would include omitting  a  reference,  or  providing  an  incorrect  reference,  in  an  NST  Format  3  notification regarding  the  movement  of  a  heavy  bomber  or  ICBM.  All  NST  reporting  deviations  are managed IAW procedures outlined in the NST Reporting Handbook. 24 AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 Chapter 5 SAFETY AND SECURITY 5.1.  General. 5.1.1.  Compliance  with  the  NST  is  mandatory.  However,  such  compliance  should  not compromise  operational  safety  or  security  requirements.  Adherence  to  existing  Air  Force safety  and  security  directives  and  proper  advance  planning  should  prevent  situations  from arising  where inspection rights  conflict  with  established procedures.  It  may  be necessary to reassess  such  requirements  as  a  result  of  the  NST  and  change  requirements  to  allow compliance with the NST. 5.1.2.  Should  situations  arise  where  inspection  rights  conflict  with  established  safety  and security procedures, the unit TCO shall consult with the DTRA Escort Team Chief to resolve the situation in such a way as to accommodate NST compliance within the bounds of safety and security standards. (T-1) 5.1.3.  Ensuring personnel safety remains the highest priority of all escorts. Safety standards cannot be relaxed or compromised in the course of inspections. 5.1.4.  Operational security and communications security (COMSEC) standards apply during inspections.  The  mission  of  inspection  escorts  is  to  ensure  that  compliance  with  these standards  is  maintained  while  allowing  the  inspection  team  to  satisfy  their  treaty  rights. Disagreements on-site default to protecting information until the DTRA Team Chief and unit leadership  agree  on  a  process,  or  escalate  the  matter  through  the  appropriate  chain  of command for resolution. 5.1.5.  Security  Classification  of  NST  Information.  US  information  provided  to  inspectors during inspections is classified in accordance with existing DoD classification guidance. As a general  rule,  DoD  classified  information  is  not  provided  to  inspectors,  however,  some information when aggregated becomes classified. DoD security classification guides regulate sharing. 5.2.  Host Unit Security. 5.2.1.  Russian  inspectors  have  specific  diplomatic  rights,  privileges,  and  immunities  as outlined  in  the  Protocol  to  the  NST  (Part  Five,  Section  II),  and  the  Vienna  Convention  on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961. The person of the inspector is inviolable, meaning for example that he or she cannot be subjected to a pat-down or other search and is not subject to arrest  or  detention.  Inspectors  are  not  subject  to  US  criminal,  civil,  and  administrative jurisdiction.  Similarly,  inspectors’  papers,  correspondence,  and  personal  property  are immune  from  search  and  seizure  in  US  territory,  as  may  be  the  aircraft  transporting inspectors to and from POEs. 5.2.1.1.  As  a  courtesy  and  to  avoid  revealing  security  procedure  information  to  the visiting  team,  DTRA  Escort  Team  members,  their  luggage,  and  hand-carried  items  are exempt from searches, unless dictated by a specific base security situation (see DOD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108V1, The Air Force Nuclear Weapon Security Manual, DOD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN  31-108V2,  General  Nuclear  Weapon  Security  Procedures,  and DOD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108V3, Nuclear Weapon Specific Requirements). AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 25 5.2.2.  The DTRA Escort Team shall meet in-coming Russian inspectors at the point of entry and  transport  them  to  the  facility  designated  for  inspection.  Luggage  and  equipment belonging  to  the  assigned  Russian  inspector(s)  include  personal  property  and  papers  which the Treaty protects.  At the POE, DTRA, and United States Customs personnel will identify and distinguish the luggage and equipment belonging to persons who do not share the same privileges and immunities. (T-0). Searches of the visiting inspectors and/or their property are prohibited,  and  any  questions  regarding  searches  are  directed  to  the  DTRA  Escort  Team Chief. 5.2.3.  It is Air Force policy that if no specific threat exists against the inspection team or the host unit before or during their visit,  additional security requirements are neither warranted nor  appropriate.  Treatment  of  the  inspection  team  as  distinguished  visitors  (DVs)  is sufficient. 5.2.4.  It  is  Air  Force  policy  that  the  local  base  escort  team  will  have  the  primary responsibility  for  ensuring  the  protection  and  safety  of  inspection  team  members  and  for limiting access to them by non-essential personnel. (T-1). 5.2.5.  If  a  threat  arises  before  or  during  the  visit  of  an  inspection  team,  the  host  unit  will react  appropriately,  inform  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief  (prior  to  arrival  if  possible),  and brief the arriving team  of the situation, the precautions they should take,  and the protective measures being taken by the base. (T-1). 5.2.6.  If a threat exists during an NST activity at a host unit, considerations should be taken to  billet the inspection team  on base  and limit/restrict their movement  as much as possible, depending on the threat. If a credible threat exists to NST activities and movement is required to  off-base  locations,  base  Security  Forces  advise  the  Air  Force  Office  of  Special Investigation (AFOSI) and local law enforcement agencies. 5.2.7.  If a credible threat exists, treaty activities may be restricted to on-base, with Security Forces personnel posted on the boundaries of areas used for lodging, dining, and other treaty activities.  Off-base  activities  require  coordination  with  local  law  enforcement.  This information is passed expeditiously to AF/A10S.  If required, a recommendation to consider terminating  the  inspection  and  removing  the  inspectors  from  the  area  is  passed  by  the  Air Staff to the USG Interagency. 5.3.  Operational Security (OPSEC). 5.3.1.  The  purpose  of  OPSEC  is  to  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  Air  Force  missions  to successful adversary collection and exploitation of critical information. OPSEC applies to all activities that prepare, sustain, or employ forces during all phases of operations (see AFI 10-701, Operations Security). 5.3.2.  Wing  OPSEC  PMs  and  unit  OPSEC  Coordinators  will  accomplish  risk  and vulnerability assessments of facilities subject to NST inspections annually. 5.3.3.  Facility  personnel  should  guard  against  the  possibility  that  someone  may  attempt  to gather  information  on  our  abilities,  capabilities,  operations,  intentions,  personnel  and organizations. It is incumbent on facility personnel to be observant and diligent in protecting information  that  might  be  used  to  compromise  our  security,  while  at  the  same  time  being courteous and pleasant. 26 AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 5.3.4.  If inquiries or actions of a Russian inspection team member raise suspicions, the host-unit’s escort shall notify the TCO, who in turn notifies the DTRA Escort Team Chief. (T-2).  Base  security  force  representatives  and  AFOSI  are  notified  of  any  suspicious  situations.  Wing OPSEC PM will also be notified. AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 27 Chapter 6 OTHER INSPECTION RELATED REQUIREMENTS 6.1.  Inspection Team Arrival Procedures. 6.1.1.  The  Wing  Commander,  or  designated  representative,  should  meet  the  visiting  escort and inspection teams upon arrival to the unit being inspected. 6.1.2.  Local  base  escorts  and  appropriate  security  forces,  if  necessary,  should  be immediately  available  to  support  the  arriving  teams.  Arrangements  should  be  made  to expedite  transportation  of  personnel  to  each  event  (e.g.,welcome/arrival  briefings,  stop  at billeting) and movement of equipment to the appropriate location. 6.2.  Asylum Requests. 6.2.1.  Should  any  foreign  national  inspection  team  member  or  visitor  express  to  Air  Force personnel a desire to seek asylum in the United States, that individual discretely informs the DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief.  Requests  for  asylum  are  handled  in  accordance  with  existing guidance and procedures in accordance with AFI 51-704, Handling Requests for Asylum and Temporary Refuge. 6.3.  Public Affairs. 6.3.1.  Hosting  units  shall  accommodate  media  coverage  of  NST  activities  IAW  DoD "Principles  of  Information,"  DoD  Directive  5122.05,  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for Public Affairs (ASD(PA)), SAF/PA, DTRA/PA, MAJCOM/PA and OASD(PA) guidance. (T-0). 6.4.  Protocol. 6.4.1.  Hosting Russian NST inspection missions is a national, legal obligation. The foreign team is afforded the opportunity to exercise their rights under the NST. The host units must facilitate the conduct of the inspection activity. (T-0). 6.4.2.  Reception of the visiting NST teams is polite, courteous, and accommodating. 6.4.3.  In the event a US dignitary, very important person (VIP), or flag officer accompanies the  inspection  activity,  appropriate  protocol  accommodations  are  afforded  him  or  her. Coordinate these procedures with the DTRA Escort Team Chief. 6.4.4.  Nearly  all  NST  activities  include  a  formal  dinner  or  function  outside  of  treaty requirements.  These  may  be  coordinated  by  the  TCO,  host  unit  Protocol  Office  and  the DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief.  Appropriate  host  unit  representation,  at  a  level  commensurate with the visibility of the activity, should be in attendance. These events are not open to the media. 6.4.4.1.  Unit  TCOs  should  coordinate  with  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief  prior  to  any gift exchange to determine the appropriate level of gift and to avoid duplication. 6.5.  Wing/Unit Local Activities. 6.5.1.  A wing/unit that is hosting NST activities may be called upon to support or facilitate leisure  time  activities  for  members  of  the  inspection  team.  Creativity,  ingenuity,  and 28 AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 flexibility on the part of the TCO are encouraged. Not all Russian inspectors speak English, so  coordination  with  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief  for  appropriate  linguistic  services  is crucial to the success of an activity. 6.5.2.  On-base  activities  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  visits  to  the  Base  Exchange and/or Commissary, Class Six store, clothing sales, Officer and/or Enlisted Clubs, cafeterias and fast food establishments, museums or displays, or other recreational facilities. If the Base Exchange and/or Commissary are visited, the TCO will be responsible for crowd control and coordinates with the facility manager to provide a separate check-out lane if required. (T-2). 6.5.2.1.  As guests of the United States, Russian inspection team members are authorized use  of  the  Base  Exchange  and  Commissary,  Class  Six  store,  convenience  stores,  and Officer and/or Enlisted Clubs. Only non-issue military clothing/items may be purchased at the clothing sales store.  The hosting unit TCO will notify any of these facilities prior to the arrival of the inspection team. (T2). 6.5.3.  Off-base  activities  include  shopping,  tourist  and  recreational  activities,  etc.  Any  off-base routine activity, including when the teams are housed off-base, requires notification to AFOSI  and  base  Security  Forces  to  ensure  appropriate  coordination  once  activities  are completed. Base Security Forces will only provide security for off-base areas that are within their jurisdiction. (T0). 6.5.3.1.  The  DTRA  Escort  Team  has  primary  responsibility  for  all  visiting  NST personnel during all activities. 6.5.3.2.  If  requested  by  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief,  the  TCO  may  provide,  as available, local base escorts and drivers to facilitate movement off-base. 6.6.  Local (Base) Escorts. 6.6.1.  Local  escorts  are  necessary  to  assist  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  and  to  facilitate  NST activities/events when Russian inspectors are visiting their base. 6.6.2.  Local  escorts  are  site-knowledgeable  base  representatives  designated  as  points  of contact for the DTRA Escort Team. 6.6.3.  The  TCO  will  control  the  reporting,  usage,  and  associated  duties  of  local  escorts assisting  during  NST  activities  IAW  their  NST  Compliance  Plan  training  and  instruction guidelines and Attachment 2. (T-2). 6.7.  Medical and Dental Support / Mortuary Services. to  provide  or  arrange  for  emergency/non-elective 6.7.1.  Host  units  are  expected medical/dental  care  as  necessary  and  as  requested  by  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief  for inspection and/or escort team members to accomplish their duties, to save lives or to stabilize injuries. (T-2). Military treatment facilities are to be used unless competent medical authority deems otherwise. 6.7.2.  The  Host  unit  should  be  prepared  to  transport  a  team  member  to  a  local  civilian medical facility if required and to stay with him/her at the local facility until care is rendered. (T-2).  The  host  unit  should  be  prepared  to  accommodate  a  national  escort  (DTRA)  to accompany  the  individual  should  evacuation  be  necessary.  The  military  medical  staff AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 29 coordinate care with the civilian facility as required. The DTRA Escort Team Chief is kept apprised of the patient’s condition and treatment at all times. 6.7.3.  Transportation  to  an  appropriate  POE,  if  required,  is  accomplished  via  usual  air evacuation  procedures  after  coordination  with  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief  and  Russian Inspection Team Chief. 6.7.4.  Commanders  must  ensure  arrangements  for  mortuary  services  are  performed  in accordance  with  Air  Force  regulations,  local  and  state  laws,  foreign  preferences,  and  in coordination with the DTRA Escort Team Chief. (T-0). 6.7.5.  In accordance with Part Five, Section V, paragraph 2 of the Protocol to the Treaty, the inspected  Party  is  responsible  for  providing  medical  services  to  the  inspecting  Party.  The inspected Party shall bear the costs of all such services.  (T-0). DTRA will reimburse the Air Force for any costs associated with medical care provided to the inspecting Party. 6.8.  Lodging and Dining. 6.8.1.  Host  unit  TCOs  coordinate  lodging  and  dining  requirements/desires  with  the  DTRA Escort Team Chief. 6.8.2.  DTRA preference for lodging NST teams is on-base or in a single off-base hotel that can accommodate both the entire US escort and Russian inspection teams.  Coordination for off-base lodging, if arranged by the host-unit TCO, is through the base Lodging Office. 6.8.3.  In  the  event  of  a  threat  situation,  lodging  is  arranged  in  on-base  facilities.  This  may involve creativity due to the short notice nature of NST activities and the relatively large size of the escort and inspection teams. 6.8.4.  For on-base lodging, certain precautionary measures, (e.g., removal of the honor bar, turning  off  access  to  pay-TV  channels)  may  be  taken  in  preparing  the  rooms,  but extraordinary  measures,  (e.g.,  excessive  lighting  from  outside  light  sources  shining  on  the building) are not necessarily appropriate. The TCO should coordinate with the DTRA Escort Team  Chief  regarding  requirements  for  lodging  (e.g.,  housekeeping  services,  telephones, security  protection,  availability  of  a  24-hour  on-site  contact).  Use  OPSEC  procedures  as  a guide  when  preparing  on-base  lodging.    Coordinate  with  OPSEC  PM  when  preparing  base lodging. 6.8.5.  Local travel is reimbursed IAW wing/unit local travel instructions. 6.8.6.  Meals, both on- and off-base, are coordinated between the TCO and the DTRA Escort Team Chief. 6.8.7.  DTRA  Escort  Team  members  will  pay  for  their  own  accommodations  and  meals, while  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Class  “A”  Agent  pays  for  the  Russian  inspection  team members. 6.8.8.  The  TCO  should  work  with  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  for  box  lunch  arrangements  if requested  by  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief.    Payment  for  box  lunches  is  typically  in advance.  The TCO coordinates with the DTRA Escort Team to accommodate this payment.   30 AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 6.9.  Transportation. 6.9.1.  Host unit TCO coordinates transportation requirements with  the DTRA  Escort Team Chief. 6.9.1.1.  NST  activities  are  conducted  on  a  strict  timeline.  Transportation  must  account for road closures, base gate security procedures, and traffic situations to ensure adherence to this timeline. (T-2). Transportation will account for weather delays and unanticipated events as best they can, and the NST activity accommodates for these situations. Delays must be mitigated to the maximum extent possible, but if not possible, TCO will notify the  DTRA  team  chief  so  a  determination  can  be  made  as  to  how  to  proceed  under  the terms of the treaty. (T-0). 6.9.1.2.  The  TCO  should  attempt  to  accommodate  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief’s requests  for  transportation  support  for  off-base  and  cultural  activities  for  the  Russian inspection  team  as  much  as  practical,  within  existing  policies/guidelines/restrictions.  In cases  where  Wing  Commander  approval  is  required  for  the  type  of  activity  or  location, the TCO will facilitate that request. (T-2).

35 Attachment 2 COMPONENTS OF COMPLIANCE PLAN A2.1.  The  wing/unit  NST  Compliance  Plan  should:  Include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  base support  procedures,  escort  requirements,  notification  and  report  preparation  and  transmission, procedures to notify local personnel and affected organizations, security provisions, billeting and transportation requirements, and protocol and public affairs procedures. A2.2.  The NST Compliance Plan identifies offices/organizations responsible for: Providing logistics support to the visiting escort and inspection teams.  The final plan should include a list showing all tasked organizations including other tenant organizations. A2.3.  Suggested components of a compliance plan: A2.3.1.  Force Support.  This  includes lodging, dining, and mortuary services.   Lodging and dining  arrangements  always  need  to  be  planned  in  advance.    Consult  with  the  DTRA START/Nuclear Division for lodging requirements. A2.3.2.  Security. This  section needs to  include  high  and low threat  security procedures  for escorts,  guards,  inspector  entry  into  controlled  areas,  operations  security  (OPSEC),  and communications  security  (COMSEC).    (Note:  Inspectors  may  not  view  normal  security procedures.) A2.3.2.1.  If  a  known  threat  to  the  inspection  is  recognized,  high  threat  options  are imposed.  These could include measures such as posting guards and implementing entry control  points  requiring  Entry  Access  Lists  (EAL)  granting  the  escort  and  inspection teams and local escorts authorized access to inspection sites and support facilities.  Low threat options may allow implementation of normal DV procedures. A2.3.2.2.  OPSEC procedures such as limiting access and controlling travel routes should be  included.    Weapons  handling  and  storage  areas,  flight  lines,  and  other  areas  of sensitive operations are to be protected. A2.3.2.3.  COMSEC  concerns  (e.g.,  how  inspectors  are  allowed  to  communicate  with their  embassy/consulate)  are  to  be  included  in  preparations.    For  example,  have  local escorts work with the DTRA Escort Team to establish appropriate communications links for inspectors to use. A2.3.3.  Medical.  Arrangements  for  emergency/non-elective  medical  treatment  of  mission team members are to be included.  DTRA is responsible for the cost of all medical treatments and is billed accordingly. A2.3.4.  Communications.  This for ceremonies/briefings,  contact  between  local  escorts,  methods  for  inspectors  to  contact  their embassies, contact between  inspection team subgroups, or other treaty-specific items. includes systems section public address A2.3.5.  Transportation. All personnel transportation requirements, arrival through departure, and  equipment/baggage  handling  to  include  special  handling  instructions  for  inspection equipment  are  included  in  this  section.  The  TCO  tries  to  accommodate  the  DTRA  Escort Team Chief’s requests for support of transportation for off-base and cultural activities for the Russian  inspection  team,  within  existing  guidelines/restrictions.  In  cases  where  Wing 36 AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 Commander approval is required for the type of activity or location, the TCO will facilitate that request. (T2). A2.3.6.  Funding. Considerations include specific billing and payment procedures. Ensure the DTRA Escort Team Chief, or his/her designated liaison, knows what is required in advance.  Coordinate  with  base  activities  for  items  DTRA  may  request  to  accomplish  their responsibilities.    Coordinate  with  the  MAJCOM  TCO  and  PEM,  preferably  in  advance  of incurring  expenses,  for  reimbursement  of  expenses  not  paid  by  DTRA,  or  that  DTRA  does not  pay.  If  DTRA  is  not  able  to  fund  a  TCO  request,  Operations  and  Maintenance  (O&M) dollars  may  be  pursued  at  the  discretion  of  the  local  wing/unit  commander  as  long  as  the requirement is authorized IAW financial regulations. A2.3.7.  Public Affairs. Clearly established ground rules on control of media movement and actions are necessary to prevent interference with inspections. The USG and DoD posture for NST inspections is “passive.” A “passive posture” means TCOs can respond to inquiries, but not  actively  promote  media  activities.  The  NST  limits  mass  media  coverage  of  inspection activities to the point of entry.  Any public affairs activity, including photography (e.g., team photo), at an inspection facility is pre-coordinated with the DTRA Escort Team Chief. A2.3.8.  Personnel.  Personnel  include  base  escorts,  facility  managers,  baggage  details, measurement  teams,  weapon  load  teams  and  inspection  support  staff.  Support  staffs  are individuals  working  real-time  contingencies  while  the  treaty  office  is  busy  with  inspectors; support staff should have a representative from each key support and inspection organization. A2.3.9.  Training. TCOs are responsible for ensuring all base personnel involved in an NST activity are well trained and able to perform their duties, including suitability of local escorts.  Not  everyone  is  suited  to  perform  escort  duties.  While  no  specific  certification  is  required, TCOs  should  ensure  experienced,  mature  individuals  are  selected.  TCOs  must  select  and train a sufficient number of personnel as escorts to support an NST inspection. In most cases, periodic refresher training is desirable and necessary. At other times, just-in-time training of local personnel may be all a base can complete due to limited availability of personnel. Bases should have a goal of maintaining a pool of trained personnel, as continuity promotes a high level of efficiency and support for complying with treaty procedures. A2.3.10.  Safety/Security. The TCO presents a safety/security briefing to the visiting DTRA escort and Russian inspection teams as part of the treaty-mandated pre-inspection procedures.  The briefing should be adapted to the local environment and should provide a perspective of the base and facilities to be used by the teams,  weather conditions the teams should expect, base security policies, escort procedures and local policies, and whom to contact should any visiting person need assistance. The TCO develops the briefing in advance and coordinates it with AF/A10S.  (T-1). (Note: The TCO shall apply the same safety/security procedures to the Russian inspection teams, DTRA Escort Teams, and local escorts.) A2.3.11.  Prohibited Activity. Identification of any prohibited activity during an NST escort mission  at  an  inspectable  facility  is  in  accordance  with  USG,  DoD,  and/or  Air  Force policy/guidance  and  is  the  responsibility  of  the  DTRA  Escort  Team,  supported  by  the wing/unit TCO, in direct support of treaty compliance. AFI16-608  31 MAY 2016 37 A2.3.12.  Protocol.  If requested, protocol assists the TCO in making arrangements for DVs, arranging off-base meals, hosting reception and departure functions, closing ceremonies, and memento exchanges. A2.3.13.  Cultural Activities. At the DTRA Escort Team Chief’s request, pre-coordinate and facilitate leisure activities such as tours, shopping, and recreational opportunities. Work with affected  support  services:  Transportation,  Base  Exchange,  Commissary,  Recreational Services,  and  affected  civilian  establishments.  The  participation  of  wing/unit  personnel  in cultural  activities  is  at  the  discretion  of  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief,  the  wing/unit commander, and the wing/unit TCO.
