Introduction.  This  Instruction  prescribes  specific  Space  Launch  (SL)  maintenance guidance and procedures to be used throughout the United States Air Force (USAF) and provides senior leadership and management direction for the accomplishment  of this mission.  This AFI applies to  SL maintenance management and mission  assurance functions.  SL is  different  from traditional missile maintenance mission areas in  that it is a hybrid mission involving aspects of acquisition, operations and maintenance expertise. 1.1.1.  Due to the nature of SL, where individual rocket components are physically mated and electrically  connected  for  the  first  time  at  the  launch  base,  launch  site  operations  and maintenance  operate  in  an  acquisitions  environment  as  the  last  stop  on  the  factory  floor, where there is significant assembly and testing occurring in the weeks and months preceding launch. 1.2.  Related  Guidance.  AFI  21-200,  Munitions  and  Missile  Maintenance  Management  contains  general  information  to  support  Air  Force  munitions  and  missile  maintenance  and provides  broad  responsibilities  for  these  organizations.    Additionally,  AFI  63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management, requires Mission Assurance to be an integral part of the life cycle of space systems.  AFI 21-214, Space Launch Maintenance and Mission Assurance is the capstone document for Space Launch maintenance management defining organizational structure and related roles and responsibilities.  AFI 10-1211, Space Launch Operations, establishes roles and responsibilities relating to space launch and range operations and maintenance, including the launch readiness review process. 1.3.  Supervision  of  Maintenance.  All  levels  of  supervision  must  place  emphasis  on  safety, security, quality and timeliness in the performance of maintenance. the 1.4.  Space  Launch  and  Equipment  Readiness.  SL  and  equipment  readiness maintenance  mission.    Maintenance  ensures  assigned  SL  and  support  equipment  remains  safe, serviceable and properly configured to meet mission needs.  Maintenance actions include, but are not repair,  overhaul,  modification,  preservation, refurbishment, testing and analyzing condition and performance. to,  certification, is limited inspection, 1.5.  Critical  Ground  Support  Equipment,  Facilities  and  Infrastructure.  Critical  Ground Support  Equipment  (GSE),  facilities  and  infrastructure  are  those  ground  systems  at  the  launch base that are necessary for the proper launch or safing of the flight hardware.  Their location can vary from umbilical cables and fixed structures co-located at the launch complex that physically support  the  rocket  or  supply  it  with  commodities  to  geographically  distant  pipelines  or  power systems that supply critical services. 1.5.1.  These systems are separate from range systems necessary for the launch, termination or tracking of all rockets and missiles during flight.  Range Maintenance Squadrons at each Space Wing maintain the ranges according to guidelines in other documents. AFI21-214  22 SEPTEMBER 2014   5  1.5.2.  Critical infrastructure not under the control of satellite or launch vehicle contractors of contractor-leased  facilities  such  as  pipelines  or  electrical  distribution  systems  will  be maintained by the appropriate wing agency. 1.5.3.  Critical  GSE,  facilities  and  infrastructure  also  includes  facilities  for  storing, processing or commanding flight hardware. 1.5.4.  Responsibility  for  maintenance  of  contractor-leased/licensed  critical  infrastructure resides  with  the  contractor.    Oversight  of  contractor-leased/licensed  facilities  at  the  launch bases  will  be  provided  by  the  Launch  Group  (LCG)  via  applicable  Letters  of  Assignment (LoA)  or  Memorandums  of  Agreement  (MoA)  between  the  Program  Office  and  the  launch base. 1.6.  Preventive  Maintenance.  The purpose of the entire maintenance process is to sustain the capability  to  support  operational  mission  requirements.    To  accomplish  this  objective,  the primary  focus  of  the  maintenance  effort  should  be  on  preventive  rather  than  corrective maintenance.  Preventive (or scheduled) maintenance ensures equipment  is  ready  and available at the time of need.  A conscientious and disciplined approach to preventive maintenance will be the method used to meet that goal safely and effectively.  Preventive maintenance concepts are described  in  T.O.  00-20-1,  Aerospace  Equipment  Maintenance  Inspection,  Documentation, Polices, and Procedures. 1.7.  Mission  Assurance  (MA).  MA  is  an  integrated  engineering-level  assessment  of  analysis, production,  verification,  validation,  operation,  maintenance  and  problem  resolution  processes performed over the lifecycle of a program by which an operator/user determines that there is an acceptable level of risk to employment of a system or end item to deliver an intended capability in an intended environment.  The objective of the MA process is to identify and mitigate design, production  and  test  deficiencies  that  could  impact  mission  success.    MA  is  achieved  through integrated  developmental  processes  and/or  independent  technical  assessment  and  requires expenditures  commensurate  with  the  criticality  of  the  mission  and  the  consequences  of  failure.  MA  activities  are  conducted  by  the  corresponding  Program  Office  and  launch  site  personnel throughout the system life cycle, and result in the establishment of the mission risk baseline for Space Flight Worthiness Certification and continuing assessment through launch. 1.8.  Use  of  Technical  Orders  (T.  O.),  Supplements,  Contractor  Procedures  and  Local Procedures.    Use  of  the  prescribed  technical  data  to  maintain  SL  systems  and  associated equipment is mandatory.  For SL and satellite processing, contractor procedures for contractor-controlled/owned hardware and software govern mission assurance and maintenance actions. 1.8.1.  Supervisors will: 1.8.1.1.  Strictly  enforce  adherence  to  and  compliance  with  T.O.s,  supplements,  local procedures and contractor procedures. 1.8.1.2.  Ensure  availability  of  required  T.O.s,  supplements,  local  procedures  and contractor procedures. 1.8.1.3.  Ensure all applicable T.O.s are part of unit Technical Order Distribution Office account in order to receive all updates, changes and revisions.   6  AFI21-214  22 SEPTEMBER 2014 1.8.1.4.  Ensure the appropriate Air Logistics Complex (ALC) technical content manager is  contacted  to  obtain  information/specifications  when  T.O.s  do  not  provide  enough detail. 1.8.2.  All personnel will: 1.8.2.1.  Recommend improvements or corrections for T.O deficiencies IAW T.O. 00-5-1,  AF  Technical  Order  System.    Official  T.O.  updates  are  the  only  valid  authority  for correcting a technical deficiency and implementing change. (T-1) 1.8.2.2.  Ensure T.O. files are current and maintained IAW T.O. 00-5-1.  Technical data can  only  be  released  outside  USAF  channels  IAW  T.O.  00-5-19,  Security  Assistance Technical Order Program. 1.8.3.  1st Air and Space Test Squadron (1 ASTS) Local Procedures. 1.8.3.1.  Local Procedures required to accomplish the assigned mission when no technical data exists will be developed IAW T.O. 00-5-1 and MAJCOM supplement, as required to conduct  SL  mission  assurance/maintenance  as  requested  by  the  appropriate  program office. 1.8.3.2.  Local  Procedures  will  be  adhered  to  and  complied  with  in  the  same  manner  as T.O.s when used. 1.8.3.3.  AFSPC/A4,  in  coordination  with  AFSPC/A3,  will  establish  approval  processes for local maintenance operations procedures. (T-2) 1.9.  Publications.  Air  Force  SL  Systems  Maintenance  is  defined  by  this  Instruction.    AFSPC will supplement this AFI or publish a separate instruction  IAW AFI 33-360.  Units must tailor procedures  to  the  unique  aspects  of  their  own  maintenance  operation  and  publish  directives, instructions, supplements and, for  functional  areas, operating instructions according to  AFI 33-360  where  more  detailed  guidance  or  specific  procedures  will  ensure  a  smooth  and  efficient operation.  Adhere to the following procedures: 1.9.1.  Do  not  publish  unit  instructions  or  Operating  Instructions  (OI)  to  change  or supplement T.O.s.  Use the authorized procedures in T.O. 00-5-1. 1.9.2.

Each  QA  evaluator must  pass  an  EPE  prior  to  performing  unsupervised  evaluations  or  inspections.  Evaluators that fail an EPE, or are overdue their annual EPE, will be restricted from performing  proficiency  evaluations  unsupervised.    EPEs  will  be  documented  on  an AF Form 2419, Routing and Review of Quality Control Reports, or equivalent, in the same manner as other PEs.  EPEs must be tracked in local QA database. 5.3.1.2.  Rating  Proficiency  Evaluations.   QA  rates  each  evaluation  based  on AQLs/standards.  An unsatisfactory PE rating means the specific task was not performed within  the  established  AQL/standards.    The  rating  applies  only  to  the  specific  task evaluated  and  not  to  other  tasks  that  a  AFRE/MAT/SMT  and  FIMs  (as  required)  or supervisor is qualified to perform.  Upon completion of an unsatisfactory evaluation, the evaluator must provide on-the-spot feedback. (T-2) Determine ratings IAW Table 5.2. 5.4.  General Proficiency Evaluation Guidelines: 5.4.1.  QA evaluators will be qualified IAW section 5.9 of this document.  (T-2) 5.4.2.

QA may perform evaluations on personnel utilizing trainers or training facilities.  (T-2) 5.4.6.  Evaluators will not be part of the task being performed.  (T-2) 5.5.  Guidelines for Conducting Proficiency Evaluations: 5.5.1.  Evaluators must afford reasonable opportunity for maintenance technicians to detect a defect or deficiency.  (T-2) 5.5.2.  Evaluation  will  be  accomplished  only  while  observing  actual  task  performance  or inspecting equipment or documentation.  (T-2) 5.5.3.  Evaluators will brief all personnel to be evaluated prior to the start of the evaluation to include how the individual or team  on the evaluation and how it will be rated.   If  a task is already in progress, notify the individuals being evaluated that they are under evaluation and brief  them  as  soon  as  possible.  (T-2)  During  the  briefing,  the  evaluator  must  advise  the technicians of the following: 5.5.3.1.  Do not compromise safety or security. 5.5.3.2.  Take breaks during the evaluation, if needed. 5.5.3.3.  The evaluator must be notified of any policy, procedure, configuration changes, simulations  or  previously  accomplished  steps  affecting  the  evaluation.    Errors  may  be assessed  for  T.O./procedure  requirements  that  are  omitted  during  task  performance  that have not been identified as previously accomplished. 5.5.3.4.  The AFRE/MAT/SMT and FIMs (as required)is responsible for tasks and related actions.  All reports, forms, parts requisition, T.O.s, contractor data/procedures, tools, test and handling equipment availability, or any other task related actions are responsibilities of the individuals evaluated.  The evaluator's presence does not shift this responsibility. 5.5.3.5.  The AFRE/MAT/SMT and FIMs (as required) may ask for technical help from personnel/agencies normally available in the conduct of day-to-day maintenance/mission assurance activities.  The evaluator conducting the evaluation should be asked only as a last  resort  and  when  all  other  avenues  of  help  have  been  exhausted.    Excessive  outside intervention that demonstrates a lack of technical/task proficiency to the degree that the task cannot  be completed without direct  supervisory involvement may result in  the task being rated unsatisfactory. 5.5.3.6.  The  evaluator  must  be  notified  of  the  start  and  completion  of  the  task  and  any delays that occur. 5.5.3.7.  Evaluator may ask questions to determine the individual’s knowledge of the task under  evaluation.    Individuals  may  refer  to  technical  guidance  or  use  their  normal supervisory chain of command when answering questions.   22  AFI21-214  22 SEPTEMBER 2014 5.5.3.8.  Evaluators  will  stop  a  task  immediately  if  conditions  are  detected  that  would jeopardize  personnel  or  safety,  security,  system  reliability  and/or  cause  equipment damage. 5.5.3.9.  All actions performed are subject to evaluation. 5.5.4.  Following the evaluation, the evaluator must critique the technicians on the portion of the task they were evaluated on.  The evaluator must inform the work center supervisor when a task is rated unsatisfactory or the results have not been determined.  (T-2) 5.5.4.1.

Quality Verification Inspections (QVI).  A QVI is an inspection of equipment condition, or  a  process,  an  assessment  following  an  inspection,  servicing  or  repair  action,  or  verification that  a  AFRE/MAT/FIM/SMT  or  supervisor  properly  completed  an  inspection  or  repair  action.  QVIs  shall  not  be  conducted  after  equipment  operation  when  such  operation  could  invalidate indications  of  proper  job  accomplishment.    Limit  QVIs  to  the  T.O.s  required  for  the  job.  Normally  this  inspection  does  not  require  disassembling  parts,  removing  stress  panels  or  like actions.  The QVI report should reflect deficiencies by the individual who accomplished the task and identify specific discrepancies.  Each QVI is chargeable to the technician or supervisor who performed the work. 5.7.  Management  Inspections  and  Special  Inspections.  QA  conducts  inspections  to  provide managers an objective appraisal of mission capability and management effectiveness.  Focus on efficiency, procedural compliance and adequacy of directives. 5.7.1.  Management  Inspection  (MI).    Perform  these  inspections  to  follow-up  on  trends, conduct investigations or conduct research to get to the root cause of problems.  Group/CC, SQ/CC or work center supervisors may request  MIs.  MIs may encompass trends and other inspection data; high component or system failure rates; suspected training deficiencies, and tasks  outlined  in  T.O.s/procedures.    Report  MI  results  to  the  requester,  and  allow  them latitude  to  explore  options  prior  to  implementing  corrective  actions.    MIs  can  be  non-rated and may be counted in QA trends.   24  AFI21-214  22 SEPTEMBER 2014 5.7.2.  Special  Inspections (SI).  SIs are inspections not  covered by QVIs, PEs or MIs.  SIs may include, but are not limited to,  aerospace equipment  and equipment forms  inspections, document  file inspections, housekeeping,  safety  practices,  etc.    SIs  may  be  condition,  procedural  or  compliance oriented.

Includes MATs and AFREs performing surveillance of contractor launch processing activities to assess risk and suitability of contractor—performed actions. Maintenance Surveillance—Observations and activities conducted by SLS personnel to include Contract  Surveillance,  which  are  used  to  ensure/determine  if  launch  system  assets  are  reliable and  ready  for  operation  by  ensuring  adherence  to  technical  procedures,  general  maintenance practices,  safety  requirements,  security  guidelines,  environmental  compliance,  efficient   36  AFI21-214  22 SEPTEMBER 2014 utilization  of  resources,  and  resource  safety  to  include  directing  an  immediate  halt  to  actions detrimental to personnel or equipment. Mission Assurance Technician (MAT)—Perform maintenance/technical surveillance activities. They  review space launch processing procedures,  monitor launch processing activities, provide risk  assessments  and  documentation  for  LVMA  and  SVMA  through  maintenance/technical surveillance of launch processing activities. Typically, MATs are from the 2M0XXs career field with specific missile maintenance knowledge and experience. Nonconformance  Out  of  Position  work  (NCOP)—-  NCOPs  arise  from  significant  issues experienced during processing or unplanned work.  Coverage is  determined based upon  a risk-based  technical  assessment  following  SMC  approved  guidelines  for  determining  task categorization. Observation—Direct government observation of the execution and recording (if applicable) of a test procedure or task. An “observed” test procedure or task is one in which all steps (or certain pre-defined  steps)  have  been  completed,  all  anomalies  have  been  noted  (with  appropriate documentation  generated),  and  all  applicable  data  captured  while  being  observed  by  a government  representative.  Observed  test  procedures  or  tasks  are  typically  those  that  must  be accomplished correctly, cannot be easily verified by data review or post-test, and include a high risk of inducing collateral damage that could remain undetected. Oversight—  Government  surveillance/analysis  and  control  of  contractor  activities/engineering associated  with  delivery  of  a  launch  service.  Government  assumes  liabilities  for  costs  and mission success. Public  Safety—Safety  involving  risks  to  the  general  public  of  the  United  States  or  foreign countries and/or their property. Range Operations—Any procedure that requires the use of Range resources. The execution of operations focused on efficient and coordinated employment of all range assets and processes to enable the safe and timely launch of payloads and test vehicles. Real  Property  (RP)—Land,  buildings,  structures,  utilities,  improvements  and  appurtenances thereto.    Includes  equipment  attached  to,  and  made  part  of,  buildings  and  structures  but  not movable equipment.  Primarily consisting of facilities and other non-equipment support system infrastructure. leased  support Real  Property  Installed  Equipment equipment,  apparatus  and  fixtures  that  are  essential  to  the  function  of  the  real  property  and permanently attached to, integrated into or on government-owned or leased property. (RPIE)—Government-owned  or Readiness Reviews—A review to assess the readiness status of any or all aspects of mission or launch readiness elements directed by the Commander, AFSPC. Resource  Protection—The  protection  of  Air  Force  flight  hardware,  facilities,  support equipment, or other property from damage due to mishaps. Responsible  Engineer—Personnel  who  perform  technical  risk  assessments  for  mission assurance  through  engineering  analysis  of  launch  processing  activities.  Documents  engineering analyses. Typically, REs are contractors with extensive space launch processing experience. AFI21-214  22 SEPTEMBER 2014   37  Risk Assessment—Actions conducted for mission assurance purposes to (1) identify and capture risk  items  from  procedure  review  and  process  observation,  (2)  assign  a  technical  risk  level  to each item, and (3) track each item through resolution/mitigation steps to acceptance or closure. Satellite  Vehicle  Mission  Assurance—SVMA  is  a  technical  and  management  process rigorously,  continuously,  and  iteratively  employed  over  a  space  vehicle  until  it  successfully separates  from  a  launch  system  in  its  intended  orbit.  SVMA  encompasses  system  engineering, risk management, quality  assurance,  and program  management  by an experienced, stable  space vehicle  agency  team.  SVMA  is  achieved  through  integrated  developmental  processes  and/or independent technical assessment and requires expenditures commensurate with the criticality of the mission and consequences of failure. Space  launch—The  ability  to  project  power  by  transporting  people  and  materiel  to  and/or through space, to include test launches and sub-orbital missions. This includes the deployment, sustainment,  and  augmentation  of  satellite  constellations  by  delivering  space  systems  to  the required orbit. Space  launch  maintenance—Maintenance  function  conducted  by  USAF  or  contractor personnel  at  the  launch  base  in  support  of  operations  to  attain  and  maintain  the  capability  to command, control, and execute a space launch system. Space  launch  Maintenance  Technician  (SMT)—Personnel  who  perform  handling  and maintenance  of  flight  hardware,  and  operate  and  maintain  support  equipment,  vehicles,  and facilities.  They  are  typically  from  the  2M0XX  career  field  with  specific  missile  maintenance knowledge and experience. SMTs are personnel assigned to 1 ASTS. Support  Equipment  (SE)—All  equipment  (i.e.,  AGE,  RPIE,  etc.)  required  to  make  or  keep  a space  launch  system,  subsystem  or  item  of  support  equipment  operational  in  its  intended environment. Verify—To  review,  inspect,  test,  check,  measure,  audit  or  otherwise  confirm  that  products, processes, or documents conform to specified requirements. Verification may be performed after work completion, e.g., safety wiring.    38  AFI21-214  22 SEPTEMBER 2014 Attachment 2 TRAINING REQUIREMENTS Table A2.1.  MAT/AFRE/SMT/FIM Training Requirements.
