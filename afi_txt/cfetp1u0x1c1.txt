This  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP)  is  a  comprehensive  education  and training  document  that  identifies  life-cycle  education/training  requirements,  training  support resources,  and  minimum  core  task  requirements  for  this  specialty.    The  CFETP  will  provide personnel a clear career path to success and instill rigor in all aspects of career field training. 2.  The CFETP consists of two parts; both of which are used by management to plan, manage,  and control training within the career field. 2.1.  Part  I  provides  information  necessary  for  overall  management  of  the  specialty.    Section  A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career progression information, duties and  responsibilities,  training  strategies,  and  career  field  path;  Section  C  associates  each  level  with specialty  qualifications  (knowledge,  education,  training,  and  other);  Section  D  indicates  resource constraints.    Some  examples  are  funds,  manpower,  equipment,  and  facilities.    Section  E  identifies transitional  training  guide  requirements  for  SSgt  through  MSgt.    Note:    Air  Force  Enlisted Classification  Directory  (AFECD),  and  AFI  36-2101,  Classifying  Military  Personnel  (Officer  and Enlisted), contain the specialty descriptions. 2.2.  Part  II  includes  the  following:  Section  A  identifies  the  Specialty  Training  Standard  (STS)  and includes  duties,  tasks,  and  technical  references  to  support  training,  Air  Education  and  Training Command (AETC) conducted training, and correspondence course requirements.  Section B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to determine if airmen satisfied training  requirements.    Section  C  identifies  available  training  support  materials.    Section  D identifies a training course index that is used to determine resources available to support training. Included  here  are  both  mandatory  and  optional  courses.    Section  E  identifies  MAJCOM  unique training requirements. 3.  This  CFETP  is  designed  to  ensure  individuals  in  AFSC  1U0X1  receive  comprehensive  and effective  training  at  the  appropriate  phases  of  their  career.    At unit  level, supervisors  and  trainers use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  3  ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED Advanced  Training  (AT).

Continuation Training (CT).  Training for crewmembers already qualified in their respective crew position  to  maintain  their  assigned  level  of  proficiency.    CT  is  designed  to  progressively  improve basic  qualification,  combat  mission  ready,  basic  mission  capable,  and  crewmember’s  ability  to perform the unit’s mission. Core Task.  A task AFCFMs identify as a minimum qualification requirement within an Air Force specialty or duty position.  Core Tasks for the AFS can be either task or knowledge based and are the STS line items fundamental to meeting these core  competencies.  Each MAJCOM is responsible for developing  the  minimum  standard  to  which  each  core  task  will  be  trained.    Core  skills  (or knowledge)  must  be  trained,  maintained,  and  certified,  regardless  of  duty  position/location  and  are based upon skill level. Core Competencies.  The mission of the U.S. Air Force is to defend the United States and protect its  interests  through  air  and  space  power.    To  achieve  that  mission,  the  Air  Force  has  a  vision  of Global Vigilance, Reach and Power.  That vision orbits around three core competencies:  Developing Airmen, Technology-to-Warfighting and Integrating Operations.  These core competencies make our six distinctive capabilities possible:   4  Aerospace Superiority:  With it, joint forces can dominate enemy operations in all dimensions – land, sea, air and space. Global Attack: Because of technological advances, the Air Force can attack anywhere, anytime – and do so quickly and with greater precision than ever before. Rapid Global Mobility: Being able to respond quickly and decisively anywhere we’re needed is key to maintaining rapid global mobility. Precision Engagement: The essence lies in the ability to apply selective force against specific targets because  of  the  nature  and  variety  of  future  contingencies  demand  both  precise  and  reliable  use  of military power with minimal risk and collateral damage. Information  Superiority:  The  ability  of  joint  force  commanders  to  keep  pace  with  information  and incorporate it into a campaign plan is crucial. Agile Combat Support: Deployment and sustainment are keys to successful operations and cannot be separated.  Agile combat support applies to all forces, from those permanently based to contingency build-ups to expeditionary forces. The Air Force bases these core competencies and distinctive capabilities on a shared commitment to three core values – integrity first, service before self and excellence in all we do.

This CFETP provides information necessary for the Air  Force  Career Field Manager (AFCFM),  MAJCOM  functional  managers  (MFMs),  commanders,  training  managers,  supervisors, and  trainers  to  plan,  develop,  manage,  and  conduct  an  effective  and  efficient  career  field  training program.    The  plan  outlines  the  training  that  individuals  must  receive  in  order  to  develop  and progress  throughout  their  career.    For  the  purpose  of  this  plan,  training  is  divided  into  four  areas: initial  skills,  upgrade  training  (UGT),  qualification  training  (QT),  and  continuation  training  (CT). Initial  skills  training  is  the  Air  Force  Specialty  specific  training  an  individual  receives  upon  entry into  the  Air  Force  or  upon  retraining  into  this  specialty  for  award  of  the  3-skill  level.    Upgrade training  identifies  the  mandatory  courses,  task  qualification  requirements,  and  correspondence course completion required for award of the 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position.   This training  program  occurs  both  during  and  after  the  upgrade  training  process.    It  is  designed  to provide  the  performance  skills/knowledge  training  required  for  the  job.    Continuation  training  is additional  training  either  in-residence  or  exportable  advanced  training  courses,  or  on-the-job training,  provided  to  personnel  to  maintain  their  skills  and  knowledge  beyond  the  minimum required.  The CFETP has several purposes, some are: 1.1.  Serves  as  a  management  tool  to  plan,  manage,  conduct,  and  evaluate  a  career  field  training program.    Also,  it  is  used  to  help  supervisors  identify  training  at  the  appropriate  point  in  an individual’s career. 1.2.  Identifies  task  and  knowledge  training  requirements  for  each  skill  level  in  this  specialty  and recommends training and education throughout each phase of an individual's career. 1.3. Lists courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training medium. 1.4.  Identifies  major  resource  constraints  that  impact  full  implementation  of  the  desired  specialty training program. 2.  Uses.  The CFETP will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available and/or instituted for each individual in the specialty. 2.1.  Training  personnel  will  develop  and  revise  formal  resident,  non-resident,  and  exportable training  based  on  requirements  established  by  the  user  and  documented  in  Part  II  of  the  CFETP. The lead command MFM  will work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition  strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  MFMs  will  ensure  their  training  programs  complement  the  CFETP  mandatory  initial  and upgrade  skills  requirements.    Identified  requirements  can  be  satisfied  by  OJT,  resident  training, contract training, or exportable courses.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate available training resources. 2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 2.4. Personnel in AFSC 1U0X1 are exempt from maintaining OJT Training Folders (AF Form 623). All  training  is  certified  via  AF  Form  8  by  trained  evaluators.    Certification  of  the  AF  Form  8 eliminates the requirement to document STS items in this CFETP. 3.    Coordination  and  Approval.    The  AFCFM  is  approval  authority.    Also,  the  AFCFM  will initiate  an  annual  review  of  this  document  to  ensure  currency  and  accuracy.    MAJCOM  functional managers  and  AETC  training  managers  will  identify  and  coordinate  on  the  career  field  training requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II,  they will eliminate duplicate training.  Send any applicable inputs/changes to this CFETP through MAJCOM the appropriate functional managers to the  following:  HQ  USAF/A3O-AT,  1480  Air  Force  Pentagon,  Washington  D.C.  20330-1480. 8  Section B - Career Progression and Information 4.

Training  Decisions.    The  CFETP  uses  a  building  block  approach  (simple-to-complex)  to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the  Sensor Operator career field.  This CFETP  was  developed  to  include  life-cycle  (day  one  through  retirement)  training  requirements  for this  specialty.    The  spectrum  includes  a  strategy  for  when,  where,  and  how  to  meet  the  training requirements.    The  strategy  must  be  apparent  and  affordable  to  reduce  duplication  of  training  and eliminate  a  disjointed  approach  to  training.    The  following  training  decisions  were  made  at  the 1U0X1 RPA Sensor Operator Career Field Stand-Up Working Group, held at Randolph AFB, Texas in June 2009.  6.1. Initial Skills Training.  Significant changes were made in initial skills training.  The STS was changed to include Aircrew Fundamentals Course and define common core training required for the 1U0X1 AFSC. 6.2. Five Level Upgrade Training.  The Aircrew Fundamentals, 1U051 CDC was added as a pre-requisite  volume  prior  to  starting  the  AFSC  1U051  CDC.    Completion  of  all  CDC  sets  provides required training for upgrade in the RPA Sensor Operator related positions. 6.3. Seven Level Upgrade Training.  The CSAF has approved a variance, eliminating the requirement for in-residence 7-level training for all 1U0X1 (Aircrew Operations Career Field) personnel.  7.  Community College of the  Air Force (CCAF).  CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain  an Associate  in  Applied  Sciences  (AAS)  Degree.    Enrollment  in  CCAF  occurs  upon  completion  of  basic military  training.    Off-duty  education  is  a  personal  choice  but  is  highly  encouraged.    In  order  to receive  Senior  Rater  Endorsement  on  the  SNCO  EPR,  individuals  will  obtain  a  CCAF  degree  and complete  requisite  Professional  Military  Education  (PME).

Lists in column 1 of attachment 2, the tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for  airmen  to  perform  in  the  3-  and  5-skill  level  AFSC  in  the  Remotely  Piloted  Aircraft  Sensor Operator  Career  Field.    These  are  based  on  an  analysis  of  the  duties  listed  in  Air  Force  Enlisted Classification Directory.   2.2.    Column  2  (3-skill  level  and  5-skill  level)  shows  formal  training  and  correspondence  course requirements  as  described  in  ETCA  at  web  site  https://etca.randolph.af.mil/  and  the  career  knowledge provided  by  the  correspondence  course.    There  is  no  advanced  course.    See  AFIADL/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit OJT manager for current CDC listings. 2.3.  Qualitative Requirements.   Attachment  1 contains  the  proficiency  code  key used  to  indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses. 2.4.  Is  a guide  for  development  of  promotion  tests  used  in  the Weighted  Airmen  Promotion  System (WAPS).    Specialty  Knowledge  Tests  (SKTs)  are  developed  at  the  Air  Force  Occupational Measurement  Squadron  (AFOMS)  by  senior  NCOs  with  extensive  practical  experience  in  their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS  subject matter areas judged by test development team members to be most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based on study references  listed  in  the  WAPS  study  catalog.    Individual  responsibilities  are  in  AFI  36-2605,  Air Force Military Personnel Testing System. 3.  Recommendations.    Report  unsatisfactory  performance  of  individual  course  graduates  to  37 TRG/DOS, 1220 Truemper Street, Suite 1, Lackland AFB, TX 78236-5568.  Please reference specific STS paragraphs when submitting recommendations.    BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE   OFFICIAL              PHILIP M.

(EVALUATION)   EXPLANATIONS **  A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.  (Examples:  b and 1b)   ***  A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks.  This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.  This mark is used alone in course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.   -  x  @@  This mark is used to show the five general education requirements by CLEP/DANTES (pass or fail) towards CCAF degree.

Each  objective  is  indicated  as  follows:    W  indicates  task  or  subject  knowledge which is measured using a written test, PC indicates required task performance which is measured with  a  performance  progress  check,  and  PC/W  indicates  separate  measurement  of  both  knowledge and  performance  elements  using  a  written  test  and  performance  progress  check.    P  indicates performance test only. 5.  Standard.  The  standard  is  85%  on  written  examinations.    Standards  for  performance measurement  are  indicated  in  the  objective  and  delineated  on  the  individual  progress  checklist.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.   6.  Proficiency  Level.    Most  task performance  is  taught  to  the  “2b”  proficiency  level which  means the students can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task. 7. Course Objective.  These objectives are listed in the sequence taught by Block of Instruction. 7.1.
