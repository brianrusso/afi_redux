When  in-garrison,  RegAF  RHSs  based  in  the  Continental  US  (CONUS)  are under the ADCON of their respective Numbered Air Force (NAF).  When mobilized to support  a  CCMD,  the  Commanders  of  Air  Force  Forces  (COMAFFOR)  has  OPCON, acting  under  delegated  authority  from  the  unified  Combatant  Commander  (CCDR) concerned, but the NAF retains ADCON. 1.3.9.2.  The  RegAF  PACAF  RHSs  are  under  the  ADCON  of  their  respective Contingency  Response  Group  and  Wing.    HQ  PACOM  has  OPCON  of  all  PACAF RHSs. 1.3.9.3.  All AF Reserve (AFR) RHSs are under ADCON of 22 AF/622nd Civil Engineer Group  (CEG).    When  mobilized  to  support  a  CCMD,  the  COMAFFOR  has  OPCON, acting under delegated authority from the unified CCDR concerned, but 22 AF/622 CEG retains ADCON. AFI10-209  28 AUGUST 2017 9 1.3.9.4.  In a state military duty ANG status, all ANG RH units are under the command authority of their respective State Adjutant General (TAG).  RH units activated to a Title 10  military  duty  (Air  National  Guard  of  the  United  States  [ANGUS])  status  are  under relevant  federal  command  authorities  and  are  usually  attached  to  the  supported operational  command  (COMAFFOR)  for  OPCON  and  assigned  to  the  201st  Mission Support Squadron, a subordinate unit of the Air National Guard Readiness Center, Joint Base  Andrews  for  ADCON.    The  respective  ANG  RH  units’  TAG  may  also  order  an ANG RH unit to state active duty for operational support of a state requirement in their respective state.  In those situations, the TAG will have command and control (C2) of the ANG RH unit. 1.3.9.5.  In a non-mobilized status, AFRC/A4CX and NGB/A4X coordinate between the Force Provider(s) and their respective RH units. 10 AFI10-209  28 AUGUST 2017 Chapter 2 RED HORSE PROGRAM 2.1.  RH Capability.  To support combat air power worldwide, RH provides the COMAFFOR a dedicated,  flexible  airfield  and  base  heavy  construction  and  repair  capability,  along  with  many special capabilities that allow the COMAFFOR to move and support missions as the air order of battle dictates.  The standard RH capability consists of 404 engineers and support personnel with approximately 1,000 short-tons of vehicles and heavy construction and support equipment.  This organic  support  allows  the  unit  to  operate  independently  for  extended  periods  of  time  until normal  supply  channels  are  established.    In  addition  to  the  standard  capability,  the  RH  special capabilities  consist  of  approximately  2,200  short-tons,  which  can  be  tailored  to  meet  specific construction  and  repair  requirements.    When  operating  in  a  higher  threat,  non-permissive environment  outside  a  forward  operating  base  (FOB)  or  collocated  operating  base,  the  RH commander, in coordination with the area commander (i.e. combat arms land force commander), determines additional security requirements based on operational risk.  Reference JP 3-34, Joint Engineering Operations, and Air Force Doctrine Annex (AFDA) 3-34, Engineer Operations, for additional information. 2.2.  Concept  of  Operations.  RHSs  are  organized  into  “building  block”  UTCs  to  operate  in  a hub-and-spoke  concept.    The  concept  is  to  deploy  the  squadron,  including  augmentees,  to  a single  AOR.    RH  establishes  a  centrally  located  hub  and  forward  deploys  construction  teams (spokes) from the hub.  The hub manages and supports multiple spoke operations.  The number of AORs supported and hubs and spokes opened are determined by COMAFFOR requirements.  RHSs  are  generally  comprised  of  20  personnel  and  24  equipment  UTCs.    All  RH  personnel UTCs  are  listed  in  Table  2.1.    All  RH  equipment  UTCs  are  listed  in  Table  2.2  and  provide horizontal and vertical construction in addition to specialized capability vehicles and equipment to meet specific taskings. Table 2.1.  Personnel UTCs. UTC Series Advanced Echelon (ADVON) Teams UTC 4FPRK/4FPRL  Hub Teams Construction Teams 4FPRQ (2) 4FPRY (1) 4FPRX (1) 4FPRW (2) 4FPRV (3) 4FPRU (4) 4FPRT (4) 4FPRS (2) Title Air Insert Engineer Repair Team  Site Assessment Team  Primary Beddown and Command and Control (C2) Hub Secondary Beddown and C2 Hub Additional Construction Support Element Horizontal Construction Team, Large Horizontal Construction Team, Small Vertical Construction Team, Large Vertical Construction Team, Small 2.2.1.  Deployment  Sequencing.  RHSs  generally  deploy  personnel  in  three  echelons (ADVON,  Hub,  and  Construction  as  depicted  in  Table  2.1).    The  three  echelons  ideally deploy in the following sequence:  ADVON teams consisting of Air Insert Engineer Repair Team and Site Assessment Teams, followed by the Hub Teams.  Finally, Construction Teams deploy individually or in any combination of the Horizontal Construction Teams or Vertical Construction Teams.  Individual RH UTCs may be tasked to support any contingency IAW the War and Mobilization Plan, Volume 1 (WMP-1), CE Supplement. AFI10-209  28 AUGUST 2017 11 2.2.2.  Hub  and  Spoke  Operations.  Hub  operations  are  self-sufficient  with  re-supply  of consumable  items  (water,  fuel,  food  rations,  construction  materials,  etc).    If  hub  and  spoke operations  are  collocated,  they  are  self-sufficient.    Spoke  operations  are  not  self-sufficient unless collocated with a base operating support provider. 2.2.3.  UTC  Mission  Capability  (MISCAP).    The  size  and  complexity  of  construction projects drive the number and type of equipment UTCs deployed.  Table 2.2 lists equipment UTCs  and  typical  employment  capabilities.    Personnel  and  equipment  UTC  MISCAP statements  have  detailed  information  on  their  capabilities  and  configuration.    The  latest MEFPAK information  can  be  downloaded  at:  https://intelshare/intelink.sgov.gov/sites/afma/utc%20analysis/default.aspx. tool  containing  approved  UTC Table 2.2.  Equipment UTCs.

All deployed squadron commanders (or highest ranking member if the commander is not  deployed)  must  submit  an  AAR  no  later  than  30  days  from  departure  of  the  deployed location.    Commanders  submit  their  AARs  through  the  Air  Force-Joint  Lessons  Learned Information  System  (AF-JLLIS)  web-based  reporting  tool  using  “AAR  Builder.”  (T-1).  These  reports  are  accomplished  after  deployment,  exercise,  or  other  major  event  IAW  AFI 90-1601, Air Force Lessons Learned Program. 2.9.2.  Team  chiefs  will  submit  OILs  via  the  AF-JLLIS  website  using  the  “Add  an Observation” form. (T-1). 2.9.3.  All deployed squadron commanders, officers-in-charge/noncommissioned officers-in-charge,  and  Individual  Augmentees  are  encouraged  to  submit  individual  OILs  as  they  are encountered  during  their  deployment  rather  than  waiting  to  consolidate  all  OILs  in  AARs.  Individual  OILs  are  submitted  on  the  AF-JLLIS  website  using  the  “Add  an  Observation” form. 2.9.4.  All  personnel  are  encouraged  to  submit  pre-deployment  training  (e.g.    combat  skills training,  etc)  OILs.    These  are  submitted  on  the  AF-JLLIS  website  using  the  “Add  an Observation” form. 14 AFI10-209  28 AUGUST 2017 2.9.5.  Unclassified  AARs  and  individual  observations  are  submitted  via  the  AF-JLLIS NIPRNET weblink at:  https://www.jllis.mil/ and classified items are submitted via the AF-JLLIS SIPRNET weblink:  http://www.jllis.smil.mil/. 2.9.6.  AFCEC/CXX will immediately act upon and disseminate submitted OILs. (T-1). 2.9.7.  AARs/EOT reports (Attachment  9) should be submitted using the same distribution list  as  the  SITREPs.    These  documents  are  used  to  capture  key  issues/concerns  from  the tasking as well as provide historical documentation. 2.10.  Inspections.  RHSs will comply with AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System. (T-1). AFI10-209  28 AUGUST 2017 15 Chapter 3 TRAINING 3.1.  Purpose.  This chapter outlines the minimum training requirements for RH personnel.  RH training  requirements  are  vetted  and  approved  through  the  CE  Governance  Structure  (see paragraph    1.3.2.3.    Qualification  consists  of  initial  and  reoccurring  training  to  maintain proficiency. 3.2.  RH  Special  Capability  and  Air  Force  Specialty  Code  (AFSC)  Specific  Training.  RH members  will  receive  mandatory  training  IAW  requirements  listed  in  Attachments  2-7.  (T-1).    The  training  requirements  listed  contain  specific  AFSC  training  and  minimum  frequency required  for  mission  capability  in  each  UTC.    For  example,  pavements  milling  requires  one trained  AFSC  3E2X1  per  large  horizontal  team,  and  for  squadrons  that  posture  the  three  large horizontal team UTCs, at least three 3E2X1s need to be trained.  At a minimum, training must be conducted  as  often  as  required  by  this  Instruction.  (T-1).    Squadrons  are  highly  encouraged  to train more often at their discretion. 3.3.  RH  Special  Capability.  RH  units  offer  unique  competencies  in  heavy  repair,  horizontal, vertical,  and  support  construction.    RH  provides  these  competencies  through  their  special capabilities  training  program.    Special  Capability  training  is  divided  into  high  and  low  density categories. 3.3.1.  High  density  capabilities  are  inherent  to  RH  key  tasks  of  heavy  repair  and construction.  A large number of personnel will be trained in these capabilities. Table A4.1, Special Capabilities Training, identifies the required UTCs and AFSCs that must accomplish the  training  as  well  as  the  frequency  requirements  and  sources  for  training  material.    Units will  ensure  the  required  personnel  meet  the  requirements  in  Table  A5.1,  High  Density Special  Capabilities  Validation  Requirements.  (T-1).    Training  is  normally  accomplished through  the  unit’s  TTP  program.    Alternately,  it  can  be  accomplished  by  attending  courses held at a RH lead training unit as stated in paragraph  3.4. 3.3.2.  Low  density  capabilities  require  specialized  training  to  be  performed.    A  limited number  of  personnel  are  trained  in  these  capabilities.    Table  A4.1  identifies  the  required UTCs  and  AFSCs  that  must  be  trained  in  these  capabilities,  as  well  as  the  frequency requirements  and  sources  for  training  material.  (T-1).    This  training  will  only  be accomplished through lead training units unless otherwise noted. (T-1). 3.3.3.  When RH personnel perform a high density special capability without attending a lead training  unit  course  and  still  meet  the  criteria  defined  in  Table  A5.1,  the  unit  commander may certify those personnel as current.  (T-1).  To qualify, the validation resource readiness reporting  standard  must  be  performed  under  the  full-time  supervision  and  instruction  of  at least one member currently qualified from the lead training unit course. (T-1).  The currency date for the validation resource readiness reporting standard is the day all required tasks have been completed. 3.4.  RH  Lead  Training  Units.  RH lead training units, as depicted in  Table  3.1, will develop  training programs, lesson plans, and schedules in conjunction with AFCEC/CXX to support all RH units. (T-1).  The lead training unit shall provide a schedule of classes to AFCEC/CXX NLT 1  April  each  year.  (T-1).    The  schedule  will  be  approved  and  posted  on  the  AFCEC 16 AFI10-209  28 AUGUST 2017 Expeditionary  Engineering  SharePoint  site  at  https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/21340/default.aspx.  An annual review of all lesson plans will be conducted by the lead training unit in conjunction with  AFCEC  (refer  to  paragraph    1.3.3.3).  (T-1).    Lesson  plans  can  be  found  on  the Expeditionary  Engineering  SharePoint  site  (see  link  above).    Lead  training  units  should research/develop  new  improved  standards/techniques  and  present  them  to  AFCEC/CXX  for review as necessary. Table 3.1.  RH Lead Training Units.

Government Vehicle and Equipment Operations Training & Licensing.  RH personnel operating  AF  government  motorized  vehicles  must  be  properly  trained  and  licensed  IAW  AFI 24-301.  (T-1).    Specific  details  for  vehicle  and  equipment  types  are  listed  in  Attachment  6  to meet the minimum requirements to perform the RH wartime mission.  Units may train additional personnel when time and resources permit. 3.6.  Air  Insert  RH  Additional  Training  Requirements.  Each  Air  Insert  RH  member  will receive  mandatory  training  IAW  training  requirements  listed  in  Attachments  2-7.  (T-1).  Training must be conducted as often as required in order to maintain the capabilities specified in the Air Insert RH UTC MISCAP statement. (T-1).  The squadron may choose to train more often at its discretion. 3.7.  Supplemental and Enhancement Training. 3.7.1.  Supplementary  AFSC  specific  training  not  identified  in  Attachments  2-7  should  be coordinated  and  scheduled  with  the  host  base  to  ensure  all  AFSCs  (in  particular  non-CE AFSCs) receive adequate career progression in accordance with their respective Career Field Education and Training  Plan (CFETP) and remain familiar with  their primary  AFSC skills.  Local Memorandums of Agreement (MOA)/Memorandums of Understanding may need to be established  to  assist  in  facilitating  supplemental  AFSC  training  at  the  discretion  of  the commander. 3.7.2.  Units  may  also  assist  personnel  in  attending  additional  discretionary  courses  such  as the United States Army Pathfinder and Ranger Schools if funding and time permit.  AFI10-209  28 AUGUST 2017 17 3.8.  Formal  Documentation.  RHS will document contingency and special capabilities training using  ARIS  as  stated  in  paragraph    1.3.8.2.  (T-1).    IAW  AFI  36-2201,  Air  Force  Training Program,  personnel  deploying  over  30  days  will  either  hand  carry  AF  Form  623,  Individual Training Record Folder, or have access to automated training records. (T-1).  Upon separation or reassignment, the Unit Training Manager must provide a copy of the automated training record for the member and archive the record or transfer the record to the gaining unit via ARIS. (T-1).  Sign-in rosters used to document training must be kept on file IAW guidelines established in the RDS. (T-1).  Data will be used to periodically verify the currency of information in ARIS. 3.9.  TTP Program.  TTPs provide RHSs the primary means for wartime heavy construction and AFSC specific training through the execution of real-world construction projects.  TTPs ensure exercise  of  RH  heavy  construction  and  repair  capability.    Emergency  and  contingency-type projects  related to  tactical  deployments  or natural  disasters are not  included under the terms of this  chapter  as  the  scope  and  criteria  is  determined  at  the  time  of  emergency/contingency employment. 3.9.1.  Security  cooperation  projects  also  fall  under  the  RH  TTP  program  and  include  all training  construction  or  repair  projects  accomplished  by  RH  troop  labor  supporting  Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) sponsored exercise related construction, Innovative Readiness Training, Humanitarian  Civic  Assistance,  State  Partnership  Program,  and  MAJCOM/CCMD  specific building  partnership  capacity/engagement  programs  (e.g.  ENCAPs,  Deployment  for Training, etc). 3.9.2.  RegAF RH units will afford opportunities to enhance AFSC skills of ARC personnel through TTP accomplishment  IAW the DFT construct presented in  Figure 5.1, Total Force RED  HORSE  Force  Presentation.  (T-1).    In  addition,  RegAF  RH  units  will  identify requirements  for  the  necessary  Military  Personnel  Appropriation  days  (MPA)  from  their respective HQ AFIMSC Detachments MPA Day  Managers to support ARC involvement in TTP  execution.  (T-1).    Conversely,  the  ARC  units  will  afford  opportunity  to  RegAF  RH units to participate in Deployment for Training opportunities.  (T-1).  RH TTP opportunities will  enhance  the  overall  management,  technical  and  command  skills  as  well  as  develop habitual  relationships  for  the  RH  enterprise  IAW  AFI  90-1001,  Planning  Total  Force Associations (TFAS). 3.9.3.  TTP  Compliance.    All  RH  TTPs  must  be  performed  under  the  guidance  of  this Instruction and must comply with the limits, terms, and authorities set forth in AFI 32-1032, Planning  and  Programming  Appropriated  Fund  Maintenance,  Repair,  and  Construction Projects,  or  other  applicable  component  programming  rules.  (T-1).    Due  to  the  various funding  sources,  additional  programming  rules  may  apply  in  addition  to  AFCEC  business rules as well as CCMD specific guidance (e.g. USPACOM Cooperative Programs Business Rules, etc). 3.9.4.  TTP  Baseline.    The  TTP  baseline  represents  the  capabilities  available  by  the  Total Force  RH  Airmen.    This  baseline  can  be  met  by  projects  sourced  through  the  AFCAMP, coordinated  with  and  funded  by  non-AF  customers,  or  completed  during  exercises  and security cooperation activities.  It is the responsibility of each RHS/CC to ensure the baseline requirements are exercised during dwell.  As depicted in Table 3.2, during a standard dwell cycle,  units  (or  404  pairings)  will  exercise  construction  capabilities  in  the  following  areas:  large  asphalt,  large  concrete,  heavy  earthwork,  vertical  structures,  placement  of  Concrete 18 AFI10-209  28 AUGUST 2017 Masonry Unit (CMU) block, utility installation, high voltage electrical installation and water well drilling. (T-2).  AFCEC/CXX will facilitate coordination between the units, MAJCOMs and  AFCEC/P&I  for  the  solicitation,  selection,  programming,  approval,  and  funding  of  all TTPs sourced via the AFCAMP to support exercise of listed capabilities. (T-1).  Additional details  on  unit  TTP  program  are  outlined  in  the  AFCEC  business  rules.    TTPs  supporting security  cooperation  will  adhere  to  paragraph    1.3.4.6  and  requirements  as  defined  by  the respective CCMDs/MAJCOMs. (T-1). Table 3.2.  TTP Baseline.

TTP  Execution  and  Documentation.    Guidance  for  the  execution  and  documentation of  TTPs  is  captured  within  the  AFCEC  business  rules.    Additional  programming  and  TTP program management guidance is provided below. 3.10.  Programming Guidance. 3.10.1.  Project Cost Accounting.  The RHS executing the TTP and the benefitting base will: 3.10.1.1.  Maintain  fiscal  responsibility  to  ensure  project  costs  do  not  exceed  approved funded and unfunded amounts without prior approval from AFCEC/CP & AFCEC/CXX.  If  project  costs  appear  to  be  reaching  statutory  limits,  the  base  will  work  with  the  RH project engineer to identify portions of work to be eliminated and/or alternatives to keep costs below limits. (T-2). 3.10.1.2.  RH project engineers and managers will prepare and submit the appropriate DD Form  1354,  Transfer  and  Acceptance  of  DoD  Real  Property,  IAW  AFI  32-9005,  Real Property  Accountability  and  Reporting.  (T-0).    Per  Unified  Facilities  Criteria  (UFC)  1-300-08,  Criteria  for  Transfer  and  Acceptance  of  DoD  Real  Property,  a  DD  Form  1354 must  be  submitted  to  the  installation  Real  Property  Office  for  project  design  phases (project approval), construction progress milestones (invoice), the placed in service date (interim),  and  construction  completion.  (T-0).    Project  Engineers  and  Project  Managers must on  Milbook (https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/real-property)  to  complete  the  DD  Form 1354s. (T-1). Property  Category  Codes the  Real use posted  AFI10-209  28 AUGUST 2017 19 3.10.1.3.  Settle all accounts and return any unspent funds upon project completion.  If a project  will  not  be  complete  before  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  estimate  project  funds required to finish the fiscal year and return the remainder to the funding organization 30 days prior to the end of the fiscal year.  Accounting to provide remaining project funds in the following fiscal year will be at the guidance of the funding organization. 3.10.2.  Programming RH funded and unfunded costs must be IAW AFI 32-1021, Planning and Programming Military Construction (MILCON) Projects, and AFI 32-1032. (T-1). 3.10.2.1.  When  developing  the  DD  Form  1391,  FY__  Military  Construction  Project Data,  consideration  should  be  made  to  account  for  transportation  costs  applicable  to materials,  supplies,  and  government  owned  equipment.    In  addition,  costs  applicable  to the operations and maintenance of  government  owned equipment is  a funded cost.    For additional guidance consult DoD Financial Management Regulation (FMR) 1704. 3.10.2.2.  An  unfunded  costs  that  should  be  considered  when  developing  the  DD  Form 1391,  is  the  cost  applicable  to  the  depreciation  of  government  owned  equipment.    For more guidance, see DoD FMR 1705. 20 AFI10-209  28 AUGUST 2017 Chapter 4 RED HORSE SUPPORT 4.1.  Logistics.  RH is organized, trained, and equipped to enable the following functions: 4.1.1.

Overview.  The  AF  utilizes  its  active  and  reserve  components  to  generate  forces  and combat power for the Nation and its joint warfighters.  Together, the components (RegAF, AFR, and  ANG)  form  the  AF’s  Total  Force  (TF).    The  ARC,  consisting  of  the  AFR  and  ANG,  are integrated across the spectrum of mission areas, train  to  the same standards as the RegAF, and are  essential in  planning for and meeting TF commitments in  Global Vigilance,  Global Reach, and  Global  Power.    In  order  to  provide  efficient  and  effective  combat  capability  with  the resources  assigned  to  the  TF,  the  components  and  MAJCOMs  rely  on  Total  Force  Association (TFA)  constructs.    TFAs  provide  surge  and  rotational  capacity  of  combat  power,  enhanced training, and more efficient operations.  Through the Sponsor MAJCOM, RH units will establish TFAs IAW Figure 5.1, to improve productivity, retain mission capabilities, and achieve synergy in the use of TF equipment, manpower and infrastructure both in dwell and during contingency operations. (T-1). 5.2.  TF Success.  Successfully managing the TF requires effective leadership and collaboration from  all  Airmen.    Specifically,  RH  commanders  are  responsible  for  attaining  and  maintaining mission  readiness  to  ensure  the  TF  is  best  capable  of  leveraging  their  maximum  collaborative effects  as  they  operate  together.    TFAs  are  an  essential  element  within  RH  planning  and programming  functions  and  for  developing,  evaluating,  resourcing,  executing,  and  managing TFAs IAW AFI 90-1001. 5.3.  Total  Force  Integration  (TFI)  Management.  TFI  Management  is  the  collaborative command-level  process  of  planning,  organizing  and  aligning  associated  squadrons  to  meet mission requirements and ensure readiness while respecting force management statutes, policies, guidance,  culture  and  expectations.    MAJCOM  management  of  associated  squadrons  includes planning,  resourcing,  and  managing  issues  related  to  interoperability,  training,  communication, installation support, personnel support, and professional development.  For more specific details on the TF governance structure, force mix analyses and guidance, and developing TFAs, refer to AFI 90-1001. 5.4.  Force  Presentation.  Presentation  of  RH  forces  for  CCDRs  uses  the  DFT  concept,  as depicted in Figure 5.1.  The DFT concept provides predictable CCMD vulnerability periods for RegAF RH Squadrons (RHSs) at a 1:2 Deploy to Dwell (D2D) tempo and vulnerability periods for  AFR  and  ANG  RHSs  at  a  minimum  of  1:5  Mobilization  to  Dwell  (M2D).    The  concept  is also designed to outline habitual relationships between the RegAF, AFR and ANG squadrons in their  vulnerability  periods  through  TFI.    These  relationships  across  RH  squadrons  may  in  turn create  an  opportunity  for  these  units  to  establish  relationships  with  specific  CCDRs  when supporting non-request-for-forces requirements. AFI10-209  28 AUGUST 2017 27 Figure 5.1.

Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) System—A data system designed to support contingency and general war planning with predefined and standardized manpower and equipment force packages.  MEFPAK, which operates in the command and control environment, is composed of two subsystems:  the MANFOR and the LOGFOR. Manpower  Force  (MANFOR)  Packaging  System—A  subsystem  of  the  MEFPAK  system.  This system provides the following for each UTC:  (1) Title of the unit or force element and its unique JCS UTC (2)  The capability statement that contains the definition of unit capability (3)  The manpower detail by function, grade (officers only), and AFSC required to meet the defined capability. Mobilization—The  act  of  assembling  and  organizing  national  resources  to  support  national objectives in time of war or other emergencies; the process by which the Armed Forces, or part of  them,  is  brought  to  a  state  of  readiness  for  war  or  other  national  emergency.    This  includes activating all or part of the Reserve components, as well as assembling and organizing personnel, supplies, and material. Operating  (Using)  Command—The  command  primarily  operating/using  a  system  or  item  of equipment; generally applies to those operational commands or organizations designated by the AF to conduct or participate in operations or operational testing.  It is interchangeable with the term “Using Command" (commands who receive RH units to execute missions; e.g., US Central Command, PACAF, and US Southern Command). Parent MAJCOM—A MAJCOM to which a particular unit is assigned in peacetime. Port of Debarkation (POD)—The geographic point at which cargo or personnel are discharged. It  may  be  a  seaport  or  aerial  port  of  debarkation.    For  unit  requirements,  it  may  or  may  not coincide with the destination. Program  Objective  Memorandum  (POM)—A  biannual  memorandum  submitted  to  the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) from each military department and defense agency.  It proposes total program requirements for the next six years.  It includes rationale for planned changes from the  approved  future  years’  defense  program  baseline  within  the  fiscal  guidance  issued  by  the SECDEF. Reconstitution—The  actions  taken  on  a  bare  base  package  or  other  assets  after  return  from  a deployment to return them to their original condition. Sustainment—The  provision  of  logistics  and  personnel  services  required  to  maintain  and prolong operations until successful mission accomplishment. Unit Type Code (UTC)—A five-character, alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies each unit type in US Armed Forces. War  and  Mobilization  Plan  (WMP)—The  Air  Force  supporting  plan  to  the  Joint  Strategic Capabilities Plan.  The five volumes of the WMP extend through the Future Years Defense Plan to provide continuity in short- and mid-range war and mobilization planning.  It provides current planning cycle policies and planning factors for the conduct and support of wartime operations.  36 AFI10-209  28 AUGUST 2017 It  establishes  requirements  for  development  of  mobilization  and  production-planning  programs to support sustained contingency operations of the programmed forces.  The WMP encompasses all  functions  necessary  to  match  facilities,  manpower,  and  materiel  with  planned  wartime activity.  AFI10-209  28 AUGUST 2017 37 Attachment 2 CONTINGENCY SKILLS TRAINING TABLE (NOTE 1) Table A2.1.

Note 2:  Members must receive the initial pilot training and successfully complete a well drilling TTP to meet initial training requirements.  Upon completion of the pilot training and TTP completion members may requalify via TTP completion or pilot unit course after completing initial requirements. Note 3:  Demolition training is required monthly.  An active demolition program conducts live explosive proficiency training monthly.  Any squadron that cannot satisfy this requirement is required to have an inactive demolition program.  Inactive teams conduct monthly classroom instruction using inert explosives and participate in an annual live explosive training session supervised by an active RH demolition team supervisor.  Inactive teams will be deemed active when the inactive team is on a joint contingency deployment with an active demolition team and receives live explosive training, or receives live explosive training in the AOR from an active team and conducts demolition responsibilities throughout the deployment.  The 40-hour refresher training course must be conducted by a lead training unit instructor between 24-36 months but not to exceed 36 months to provide procedural or educational updates.  Annual explosives safety must be accomplished by individual squadron demolition teams every 12-15 months but not to exceed 15 months with two versions of the documented explosives safety test.  The installation safety office of the respective squadron demolition team approve of the lesson plan. Note 4: Members must complete the pilot course and exercise materials testing on a TTP within the respective dwell period. Note 5: A Contingency Airfield Evaluation (CAE) certification is valid for 36 months for RegAF and ARC personnel upon completion of the CAE course.  AFCEC may extend the certification for an additional 36 months if the member routinely conducts evaluations during the initial certification period IAW ETL 02-19.  If a certification has expired, the member must re-accomplish the CAE course to be recertified.
