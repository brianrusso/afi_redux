Purpose of the CFETP.  This CFETP provides information necessary for Air Force Career Field Managers (AFCFMs), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program.  This plan outlines the training that individuals in AFSC 2A7X5 should receive to develop and progress throughout their career.  This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  This training is conducted by AETC at Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola, FL.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected Airmen. Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes; some are: 1.1.  To serve as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.  It is also used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual’s career. 1.2.  To identify task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career. 1.3.  To list training courses that are available in the specialty and identifies sources of training and the training delivery method. 1.4.  To identify major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training process. 2.  Uses of the CFETP.  The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty. 2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, Training Detachment (TD), and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements.  Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses.  MAJCOM-developed mandatory training to support this AFS must be identified for inclusion into the plan and must not duplicate other available training resources. 2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. 5            CFETP 2A7X5, 01 Aug 2014The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 3.  Coordination and Approval of the CFETP.  The AFCFM is the approval authority for AFSC 2A7X5 and the AETC Training Manager will initiate an annual review of this document by AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy.  The using MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training. Section B - Career Progression and Information 4.  Specialty Description.  4.1  Specialty Summary.

Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level play an important role in the Air Force’s ability to accomplish its mission.  It is essential that everyone involved in training do their part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives necessary training at appropriate points in their career.  The following narrative and AFSC 2A7X5 career field table identify the skill/career progression. 5.1.  Apprentice (3) Level.  Following Basic Military Training, initial skills training will be provided in a resident course (JCABP2A735 048X) at 359th Training Squadron Detachment 1, NAS Pensacola,  Florida.  The course will lay the foundation for additional training at the graduate's first duty  assignment.  Upon graduation, trainees will utilize the Career Development Courses (CDCs),  task qualification training, and other exportable courses to progress in their career field.  Once  the trainer signs off the task, the trainee may perform the task unsupervised. 5.2.  Journeyman (5) Level.  Once upgraded to the 5-level, the journeyman will enter into continuation training to broaden their experience base by increasing their knowledge and skill in troubleshooting and solving more complex problems.  A 5-level may be assigned to various staff positions.  After having 48 months in the Air Force (or sooner if individual has a line number for 7     CFETP 2A7X5, 01 Aug 2014SSgt), 5-levels will attend Airman Leadership School (ALS) to enhance their Professional Military Education (PME).  A 5-level will be considered for appointment as a trainer. Individuals will use their CDCs to prepare for Weighted Airman Promotion testing.  They are highly encouraged to continuing their education toward a Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) degree in their respective career field. 5.3.  Craftsman (7) Level.  A craftsman can expect to fill various supervisory and management positions such as shift leader, element chief, shop chief, and various staff positions such as quality assurance.  Exportable MDS specific courses and MAJCOM/unit directed courses are also available.  A 7-level should take courses or obtain added knowledge in management of resources and personnel.  Continued academic education through CCAF and higher degree programs is highly encouraged in their respective career field.  In addition, when promoted to TSgt, individuals will attend the Noncommissioned Officer Academy.  5.4.  Superintendent (9) Level.  A 9-level can be expected to fill positions such as flight chief, production supervisor, and various staff NCOIC jobs.  Additional training in the areas of budget, manpower, resources, and personnel management should be pursued through continuing education.  Additional higher education and completion of courses outside their career AFS is also highly recommended. 6.  Training Decisions.    The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Low Observable Aircraft Structural Maintenance career field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet these training requirements.  The strategy must ensure we develop affordable training, eliminate duplication, and prevent a fragmented approach to training.  The following training decisions were made at the 17-21 March 2014 career field U&TW conducted virtually. 6.1.  Initial Skills.  Multiple changes were made to the STS affecting the initial skills course. Decisions were made to modify training to tasks common to both ASM and LOASM career fields as well as LOASM-specific tasks.  Numerous tasks fundamental to LOASM will be taught at the  “B/b” level; and several LOASM performance tasks levels were increased to the “2b” level.  The  initial skills course will remain generic to insure course content will remain at the unclassified  level.  The projected course length will be 58 days. 6.2.  Five-Level Upgrade Requirements.  There will be 39 common 5-level core tasks , plus 43 for B-2, 46 for F-22 and 31 for F-35.  Total 5-level core task listed is 159.  2A755 CDCs will require a major rewrite to remove unnecessary information and reorganization.  The number of volumes (4) is not anticipated to change. 6.3.  Seven-Level Upgrade Requirements.  There will be eight common 7-level core tasks, plus 6 for B-2. No 7-level core task requirements were established for F-22 or F-35 during workshop. Total 7-level core task listed is 13. There are no 2A775 CDCs; LOASM personnel will complete the 2AX7X CDCs. 6.4.  Supplemental Training.  All ASM supplemental courses are available to LOASM personnel. 6.5.  Continuation Training.  Any additional knowledge and skill requirements which were not taught through initial or upgrade training are assigned to unit training or Training Detachments. 8          CFETP 2A7X5, 01 Aug 2014The purpose of the continuation training program is to provide additional training exceeding minimum upgrade training requirements with emphasis on present and future duty positions. MAJCOMs develop a proficiency training program that ensures individuals in the Low Observable Aircraft Structural Maintenance career field receive the necessary training at the appropriate point in their career.  The program identifies both mandatory and optional training requirements. 7.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).  Enrollment in CCAF occurs upon completion of basic military training.

This area is reserved. 17        CFETP 2A7X5, 01 Aug 2014PART II Section A - Course Objective List 1.  Measurement.  Each proficiency coded STS task or knowledge item taught at the technical school is measured through the use of an objective.  An objective is a written instruction for so the student knows what is expected of them to successfully complete training on each task.  Each objective is comprised of a condition, behavior, and standard which states what is expected of the student for each task.  The condition is the setting in which the training takes place.  The behavior is the action a student must demonstrate to accomplish a task (i.e., remove and install wheel and tire assembly).  The standard is the level of performance that is measured to ensure the STS proficiency code level is attained.  Each objective uses letter code(s) to identify how it is measured.  All objectives use the PC code which indicates a progress check is used to measure subject or task knowledge.  Progress checks are also used to measure student accomplishment of performance objectives.  W indicates a comprehensive written test and is used to measure the subject and/or task knowledge at the end of a block of instruction.  PC/W indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a performance progress check. 2.  Standard.  The minimum standard is 70% on written examinations.  Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist.  The checklist is used by the instructor to document each student’s progress on each task.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. Students must satisfactorily complete all PCs prior to taking the written test. 3.  Proficiency Level.  Review column 4A of the STS to determine the proficiency level of a particular task or knowledge item.  Review the course objective list to determine which STS item the objective supports.  Review the proficiency code key in Part II, Section E of this CFETP for an explanation of the proficiency codes 4.  Course Objectives.

Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by Air Education and Training Command for the apprentice class beginning 12 June 2015. The 5-level CDC need date is 04 Sept 2015. 9.  Purpose of this STS.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, this STS: 9.1.  Lists in column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical References) the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level. 9.2.  Identifies in column 2 (Core Tasks) by asterisk (*), specialty-wide training requirements. If the task is not already designated as a core task, place just the circle at the appropriate location in the core task column. 9.2.1.  Core tasks which are not applicable to base assigned aircraft or equipment are not required for upgrade (units are not required to send personnel TDY for core task training). 9.2.2.  For units with more than one mission design series (MDS) (e.g., A-10) aircraft, upgrade trainees need only complete core tasks on a single mission design.  MFMs, unit commanders, and/or supervisors may require trainees to complete core task training on additional mission 21                 CFETP 2A7X5, 01 Aug 2014design aircraft, if desired.  If some of these core tasks involve training in another unit on base, trainees must still complete all core tasks relevant to at least one mission design aircraft. Flightline assigned personnel must complete backshop core tasks and vice versa. All units are bound by the requirements in this CFETP and will accommodate core task trainees from other units. 9.3.  Provides certification for OJT.  Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Use automated training management systems to document technician qualifications, if available.  Task certification must show a certification completed date. 9.4.  Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements.  Column 4 shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.  When two codes are used in columns 4A and 4C (e.g., 2b/b), the first code is the established requirement for resident training on the task/knowledge, and the second code indicates the level of training provided in the course due to equipment shortages or other resource constraints.  See AFCDA/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit training manager for current CDC listing. 9.5.  Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the USAF Airmen Advancement Division by SNCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog.  Individual responsibilities are outlined in AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion/Demotion Programs.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve. 10.  Qualitative Requirements.  Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and CDCs. 11.  Job Qualification Standard.  The STS becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on- the-job training when placed in automated training management systems, and used according to AFI 36-2201.  For OJT, the tasks in column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. "Go" means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct procedures.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply: 11.1.  Documentation.  Document and certify completion of training IAW AFI 36-2201.  Use of Part II and attachments one and two in conjunction with attachments three through five (as applicable to assigned MDS) of this CFETP are mandatory in individual training records.  Use of Part I of this CFETP is optional.  Identify duty position requirements by entering into automated training management systems. As a minimum, complete the following columns in Part 2 of the CFETP:  date training started, date training completed, trainee initials, and trainer initials. 22         CFETP 2A7X5, 01 Aug 201411.1.1.  Transcribing From Old CFETP to New CFETP.  All AFJQSs and previous CFETPs are replaced by this CFETP; therefore, conversion of all training records to this CFETP STS is mandatory.  Use this CFETP STS (or automated STS) to identify and certify all past and current qualifications.  Document and certify all previous and current training IAW AFI 36-2201. 11.1.2.  Documenting Career Knowledge.  For two-time CDC course exam failures, supervisors identify all Part II items corresponding to the areas covered by the CDC.  The trainee completes a study of references, undergoes evaluation by the trainer, and receives certification on the CFETP Part II.  Supervisors must document successful completion of career knowledge prior to submission of a CDC waiver. 11.2.  AF Form 797.  When additional items not listed in the CFETP Part II are necessary in the current duty assignment, enter them on the AF Form 797. 12.  Recommendations:  Report unsatisfactory performance of individual course graduates to the AETC training manager at 359 TRS/TRR, 230 Chevalier Field Ave, NAS Pensacola FL, 32508-5142, DSN 459-7483.
