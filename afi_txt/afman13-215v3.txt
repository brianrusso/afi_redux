Multi-channel  recorders/DVRS  must  have  an  approved  time  source  installed  (i.e. Global Positioning System).  (T-0) 2.2.3.  Record pilot-to-dispatch and pilot-to-metro frequencies after meeting the requirements of paragraph 2.2.1.  Use remaining channels to record individual frequencies. 2.2.4.  Digital Audio Tape (DAT) Administration. 2.2.4.1.  CCTLRs  must  establish  schedules,  procedures,  and  checklists  for  DAT changes/cleaning. 2.2.4.2.  CCTLRs  must  ensure  personnel  performing  DAT  changes  are  trained  in  the proper methods to be used and task certification is documented in AF Form 623. (T-0) 6 AFMAN13-215V3  6 FEBRUARY 2014 2.2.4.3.  CCTLRs  must  consider  local  conditions  and  ensure  DATs  are  changed  at increments  that  do  not  exhaust  DAT  capacity.    Note:  DAT  changing  cycles  must  not exceed 73 hours.  (T-0) 2.2.4.4.  CCTLRs  must  ensure  personnel  include  an  entry  on  the  AF  Form  3616,  Daily Record  of  Facility  Operation,  identifying  date,  time,  DAT  in  use,  the  initials  of  the person accomplishing the change, and reason for the change (e.g. periodic, bad tape, etc.).  (T-0) 2.2.4.5.  CCTLRs  must  ensure  an  identification  number  is  assigned  to  each  DAT  and enough are available in  the rotation cycle to  accommodate 45-day overwrite protection.  Protection must be ensured to prevent inadvertent loss of data at facilities using DATs for greater  than  24-hour  cycles.    Locations  using  a  24-hour  rotation  cycle  must  ensure  a minimum  of  45  days  between  initial  insertion  and  reuse.    Locations  using  a  48-hour rotation cycle must ensure a minimum of 46 days between initial insertion and reuse.  (T-0) 2.2.4.5.1.  Recordings  must  adhere  to  the  requirements  of  AFI  13-204  Volume  3, Chapter 5.  (T-0) 2.2.4.5.2.  DATs are replaced after 35 recording cycles. 2.2.4.6.  Directly  after  a  DAT  insertion  (as  a  standby  tape),  the  DVRS  places  a  “date created”  tag  on  the  tape  (current  Zulu  date).    DAT  software  calculates  the  45-day overwrite protection based on the “date created” tag, not the last recording on the tape.  If the recorded content of the tape exceeds two days from the “date created” stamp, there is a  potential  to  overwrite  recorded  data  too  soon  (especially  for  locations  using  DATs longer than a 24-hour cycle). 2.2.4.7.  Validate Nicelog supervision window for alarms and verify normal operations of equipment on DVRS on a daily basis, not to exceed 25 hours. 2.2.4.8.  Audio  quality  checks  must  be  accomplished  monthly.    If  this  function  is performed by maintenance, include in a LOP.  Annotate Nicelog verification and quality checks on AF Form 3616 when accomplished.  (T-0) issued  unique 2.2.4.9.  DVRS  users  are log-in  passwords  (e.g.  LOG-IN:  RT; PASSWORD:  chosen  by  RT).    Note  1:  Log-in  password  information  cannot  be  shared among  users  (e.g.,  LOG-IN:  A  Crew;  PASSWORD:  shared  by  A  Crew).    Note  2: Delete/disable  user  accounts  when  a  member  is  reassigned  (e.g.  Permanent  Change  of Station [PCS], Permanent Change of Assignment [PCA], etc.). 2.2.4.10.  DVRS should only be used for accessing and editing recordings made with the DVRS  equipment.    The  computer  workstation  and  logger  should  not  be  used  for  any other purpose. 2.2.4.11.  No other programs and/or software packages are to be loaded and/or executed on any of the DVRS system components. 2.2.4.12.  Do  not  lock  channels  longer  than  five  hours.    Locking  channels  for  extended periods  of  time  causes  hard-drive  overload  and  system  failure.    Make  an  entry  on  AF Form 3616 to show locking and unlocking times. AFMAN13-215V3  6 FEBRUARY 2014 7 2.3.  Digital Audio Legal Recorder (DALR) Administration. 2.3.1.  CCTLRs  must  establish  schedules,  procedures,  and  checklists  in  a  LOP  for audio/alarm checks. (T-0) 2.3.2.  CCTLRs  must  ensure  personnel  performing  DALR  recording  and  alarm  checks  are trained  in  the  proper  methods  to  be  used  and  task  certification  is  documented  in  AF  Form 623. (T-0) 2.3.3.  Daily Recording/Alarm Checks. 2.3.3.1.

Monthly Quality Checks. 2.3.4.1.  CCTLRs must establish procedures that ensure DALR recording quality checks are accomplished at least monthly and include an entry on the AF Form 3616 when such checks are accomplished.  (T-0) 2.3.4.2.  The  High  Density  Logger  (HDL)  establishes  a  45-day  protection  window  on recorded data automatically. 2.3.5.  Rewriteable CDs (CD-RWs), Digital Video Discs (DVDs), or any type of flash media are  not  authorized  for  use  on  the  DALR  system.

DALR  users  are  issued  unique  log-in  passwords  (e.g.  LOG-IN:  RT;  PASSWORD: chosen  by  RT).    Note  1:  Log-in  password  information  should  not  be  shared  among  users (e.g.,  LOG-IN:  A  Crew;  PASSWORD:  shared  by  A  Crew).    Note  2:  Delete/disable  user accounts when a member is reassigned (e.g., PCS, PCA, etc.). 2.3.7.  DALR should only be used for accessing and editing recordings made with the DALR equipment.  The computer workstations should not be used for any other purpose. 2.3.8.  No other programs and/or software packages are to be loaded and/or executed on any of the DALR system components. 2.3.9.  Restrict profile access as follows: 2.3.9.1.  System Administrator - AO staff and Airfield Systems personnel only. 2.3.9.2.  Organizer - 7-level AO personnel or above. 8 AFMAN13-215V3  6 FEBRUARY 2014 2.3.9.3.  Reconstruct - 5-level AO personnel or above. 2.3.9.4.  Monitor - All AO personnel. AFMAN13-215V3  6 FEBRUARY 2014 9 Chapter 3 PROGRAMMABLE INDICATOR DATA PROCESSOR (PIDP) 3.1.  PIDP  System  Adaptation.  All  PIDP  installations  use  the  same  standard  PIDP  computer software program.    Before facility delivery,  AFFSA/XSO adds site unique data to the standard software to optimize the program for use at that facility. 3.1.1.  PIDP  design  criteria.    The  program  design  criteria  for  the  PIDP  provides  air  traffic controllers  the  capability  to  furnish  a  safe  terminal  advisory  and  control  service  to  aircraft arrivals,  departures,  and  over  flights.    Required  items  of  site  unique  data  ensure  achieving this objective.  All program magnetic media delivered to each facility include the site unique data, tailoring the standard PIDP software to fit the specific system and area.  The following paragraphs  detail  specific  steps  for  collecting,  compiling,  recording,  and  submitting  site unique data for the proper functioning of the auto-acquire, terminal-to-terminal hand-off, and reflection discrimination features. For the software to function properly, keep all site unique data accurate. When necessary to change an item of site unique data, request the change from HQ  AFFSA/XSO  (DSN  884-7004).  Address  all  correspondence  concerning  PIDP  to:  HQ AFFSA/XSO, 6500 S. MacArthur Blvd, Oklahoma City, OK 73169. Process change requests at  least  30 days before the change takes  effect  to allow time for data processing and return delivery of the corrected program.   Provide the  MAJCOM Terminal  Instrument  Procedures (TERPS) office an information copy of all revisions sent directly to HQ AFFSA/XSO. 3.1.1.1.1.  Basic Site information: HQ AFFSA/XSO will provide a work sheet for site unique  data  with  the  initial  request.  Retain  a  current  copy  in  facility  records.  The operation  of  the  PIDP  software  is  dependent  upon  the  accuracy  of  this  information. Retain  a  current  copy  in  facility  records.  To  request  a  change  of  site  unique  data, identify the changed item(s) in a letter or message to HQ AFFSA/XSO. the 3.1.1.1.2.  Auto-acquire/Conflict  Alert.  Provide  coordinates  of facility’s designated  airspace  boundary  to  HQ  AFFSA/XSO.    After  processing  the  data,  HQ AFFSA/XSO furnishes a computer-generated map of the airspace, auto-acquire area, and conflict alert boundaries for local review.  Auto-acquire is roughly based on a 10 nautical  mile  (NM)  boundary  around  the  designated  airspace.    The  conflict  alert boundary  is  by  default  10  NM  outside  of  the  auto-acquire  boundary.    HQ AFFSA/XSO  designs  these  sectors  based  on  magnetic  North,  as  determined  by  the Airport  Surveillance  Radar  site’s  magnetic  variation.    The  PIDP  computer  program prevents  the  auto-acquire/  conflict  alert  functions  from  operating  on  aircraft  outside the defined boundaries. When changing auto-acquire/conflict alert limits, refer to the sector by number (1-36), and give the new requested range value(s). 3.1.1.3.1.  The PIDP terminal-to-terminal interface function allows interfacing of one facility with up to eight other automated PIDP or Automated Radar Terminal System terminal  facilities  or  non-host  centers.    Connected  facilities  interface  with  the  same Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), share a common airspace boundary, and have the software capability. Terminal Radar Service Area (TRSA) hand-offs are an additional option to the standard terminal-to-terminal interface. 10 AFMAN13-215V3  6 FEBRUARY 2014 3.1.1.3.2.  Use the HQ AFFSA/XSO form in  Attachment 2 for submitting terminal-to-terminal  interface  data.  Coordinate  the  necessary  data  between  the  terminal facilities involved. Fill in the required data beginning with Terminal Facility Number 1. The computer program  uses the facility number and the TRSA alpha character to identify that facility in hand-off processing. Facility reference IDs are the three letter identifiers  that  the  ARTCC  computer  uses  to  identify  the  facilities.  Use  two  fixes (defined by three letter identifiers) for each entry. The first fix is the entry fix and the second  is  the  exit  fix.  Indicate  the  type  of  fix  pair  (enroute  or  arrival)  on  the  form. Use  enroute  fix  pairs  for  over  flight  routes  through  the  receiving  facility’s  airspace. Use  arrival  fix  pairs  for  flights  that  terminate  in  the  receiving  facility’s  airspace.  In the case of an arrival type fix pair, the exit fix is the destination airport. Submit data required for the terminal-to-terminal function directly to HQ AFFSA/XSO at least 30 days in advance of the effective date. 3.1.1.4.2.  Facility  CCTLRs  experiencing  difficulties  with  reflections  should  contact HQ AFFSA/XSO for assistance and the necessary forms.  Data required includes the code,  altitude,  the  beginning  and  ending  range  and  azimuth  of  real  targets  and  the altitude, beginning and ending range and azimuth, and the number of sweeps for the false  targets.    Track  the  real  and  false  targets  to  determine  the  azimuth  and  range where  real  targets  begin  picking  up  reflected  signals  which  produce  false  targets.  Define  these  false  target  zones;  mark  the  real  and  false  target  zones  on  the  radar indicators in  grease pencil when the controllers’ observations show a pattern.  After the zones are clearly defined, make a sketch of the display showing the real and false target  zones.    Ensure  data  is  complete  and  accurate  to  minimize  the  possibility  of suppressing true targets.  The quality of the reflection suppression depends upon the accuracy of the observations and the size of the sample.  One or two observations do not form an adequate sample.  Conversely, hundreds of samples are not necessary to define reflections off of a building.  Twenty to thirty tracks should reasonably define the  individual  false  target  zones.    Note  also  that  some  real  target  tracks  may  have more than one false target zone (two or more false target tracks).  Record these also.  Collect  this  data  with  the  AN/TPX-42A  Interrogator  Set  operating  in  normal  low power    mode,    with  Defruit  and  Bracket  Video  “ON.”    Observe  data  from  both receivers and transmitters.  Set video signal processor settings as shown in the most recent Air Traffic Control & Landing Systems Evaluation.  HARRY C.

This information  remains  current  in  our  files  until  such  time  that  you  submit  changes  to  your  site data.    Please  utilize all of your resources to get the most correct information.  PIDP allows for up  to  eight  “Terminal  Facilities,”  this  data  collection  sheet  holds  six.    Please  attach  another page  if  you  have  more  facilities  than  the  form  allows.    TERPS  personnel  provide  Latitude  / Longitude information.    Facility  managers  provide  fix  pair  data  and  arrival  /  enroute information.    Data  System  Specialists  (DSS)  at  the  ARTS/ARTCC  facility  should  be  able  to provide adjacent  facility terminal information.  Should you have trouble obtaining any of this data, please call HQ  AFFSA/XSO at DSN 884-5696.  DEFINITION OF TERMS If  you have an adjacent NON-HOST facility,  you only have to  provide the facility name and PIDP reference identification.  All other facility entries include antenna location and fix  pair data (if required).  Facility  Name  -  This  should  be  the  terminal  facility  to  which  you  make  handoffs.    If  the ARTS facility is enhanced to receive field 13 in Track Initiate (TI) messages, then place a large “E” next to the facility name. AFMAN13-215V3  6 FEBRUARY 2014 15 PIDP  Reference  ID  -  This  is  an  ARTCC  defined  3-letter  identifier  for  the  terminal  facility.   You  must have this if you interface with an adjacent ARTS/PIDP. (T-0)  Antenna Location - Geographical location of the adjacent facility radar antenna.  Example: 51 24 33.00N 122 34 15.00W  Entry Fix ID - Entry fix for one of up to four routes (A through D).  Exit Fix ID - Exit fix for one of up to four routes (A through D).
