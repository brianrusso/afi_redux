Purpose.  This  chapter  implements  laws,  incorporates  DoD  and  Air  Force  policies,  and provides  basic  guidance  unique  to  family  housing  (FH)  planning,  programming,  design  and construction. The FH program is different from other facilities programs in statutory authorities, policy directions, budget and funding requirements and type of construction. It has unique rules, limitations,  and  restrictions  in  planning,  programming,  budgeting,  and  execution  that  are different from other military  construction and real  property  operation and maintenance  (O&M) programs.   2.2.  Program Overview: 2.2.1.  Acquisition programs include:   2.2.1.1.  New and replacement construction.   2.2.1.2.  Domestic leasing.   2.2.1.3.  Foreign leasing.   2.2.1.4.  Private-sector financing (FH Privatization).   2.2.1.5.  No-cost acquisition.   2.2.1.6.  Interservice transfer.   2.2.2.  Other programs include:   2.2.2.1.  Improvement (including minor improvements).   2.2.2.2.  Maintenance and Repair (M&R) (including minor alterations).   2.2.2.3.  Restoration or replacement for damaged or destroyed housing.   2.2.2.4.  Disposal of surplus housing.   2.3.  Planning Policy: 2.3.1.  Air  Force  Family  Housing  Master  Plan  (FHMP).  The  Air  Force  FHMP  is  a corporate plan that provides a prioritized investment strategy for providing adequate homes through  the  Military  Housing  Privatization  Initiative  (MHPI),  traditional  construction programs,  and  O&M  funding.  An  intensive  investigative  process  is  accomplished  at  each installation,  which  defines  their  housing  requirement  by  considering  the  local  community’s ability  to  provide  housing  support,  and  assessing  the  condition  and  requirements  for upgrading any required on-base housing. Director of Civil Engineers Facilities Management Division (AF/A4CF) and Director of Civil Engineers, Operations Division, Housing Branch (AF/A4CFH) use the Air Force FHMP to prepare budget submissions, and to prioritize and allocate  housing  program  funds  for  the  following  program  requirements:  privatization scored-costs (P-711/P-713); new/replacement (P-711); improvement (P-713); operations (P-721);  leasing  (P-723/P-724/P-725/P-726)  M&R  (P-722);  privatization  (P-727)  and  utilities (P-728).   AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 9 2.3.2.  Installation  Family  Housing  Master  Plans  (IFHMP).  Bases  and  MAJCOMs,  in conjunction  with  AF/A4CFH,  are  responsible  for  developing  IFHMPs.  IFHMPs  are consolidated  to  produce  the  Air  Force  FHMP.  To  develop  the  IFHMPs,  MAJCOMs  and bases  use  Housing  Requirements  and  Market  Analyses  (HRMA),  Housing  Community Profiles  (HCP),  and  a  privatization  decision  analysis.  Requirements  are  met  through  the traditional  FH  construction  (new,  replacement  and  improvement)  program.  The  IFHMP  is updated every 2 years and funded by AF/A4CFH.   2.3.3.  Housing  Requirements  and  Market  Analysis  (HRMA).  Consistent with Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) policy, installations must rely on local community housing first  and  may  only  provide  FH  to  maintain  a  minimum  FH  requirement  (floor  housing requirement)  and  to  compensate  for  shortfalls  of  adequate,  affordable  housing  in  the  local housing market.  (T-0)   2.3.3.1.  MAJCOMs and Installations, in conjunction with AF/A4CFH shall:   2.3.3.1.1.  Perform  an  HRMA  to  ensure  plans  are  made  to  only  replace,  improve, construct, or acquire units the Air Force needs.   2.3.3.1.2.  Comply  with  the  Housing  Requirements  and  Market  Analysis  (HRMA) Guidance Manual and supplemental policy guidance. (T-0)  2.3.3.1.3.  Support  projects  with  HRMAs  that  are  less  than  4  years  old  to  identify housing requirement. (T-1)   2.3.3.2.  AF/A4CFH  funds  HRMA  updates  every  4  years,  or  as  necessary,  for installations with government-owned Family Housing. 2.3.3.3.  AF/A4CFH  funds  HRMA  updates  for  installations  with  privatized  Family Housing on an as-needed basis.  2.3.4.  Housing  Community  Profile  (HCP)  Requirements.  MAJCOMs  and  bases,  under direction and guidance of AF/A4CFH, must develop an HCP to construct, replace, improve, maintain, repair, and dispose of surplus FH facilities.   2.3.4.1.  HCPs include the following:   2.3.4.1.1.  Family  Housing  unit  existing  condition  analysis  and  recommendations  to resolve all deficiencies identified in analysis. 2.3.4.1.2.  Floor plan concepts for improvement of existing unit types.   2.3.4.1.3.  Projected program requirements.   2.3.4.1.4.  Plans for land use as defined in the Installation General Plan.   2.3.4.1.5.  Uses for existing housing inventory.   2.3.4.1.6.  Housing community areas such as playgrounds and parks.   2.3.4.1.7.  Housing infrastructure and support facilities.   2.3.4.1.8.  Requirements data based on the most current HRMA.   2.3.4.1.9.  Disposal plan for surplus housing units.   2.3.4.1.10.  Condition assessment matrix (CAM) scores.   10 AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 2.3.4.1.11.  Sustainment requirement for existing units.   2.3.4.1.12.  Improvement/replacement analysis.   2.3.4.1.13.

(T-2) 2.3.4.2.  AF/A4CFH  funds  HCP  updates  every  4  years.  Tabletop  updates  may  be completed  on  an  interim  basis  (every  2  years)  or  as  necessary  when  major  mission  or execution delays occur.   2.3.4.3.  An  HCP  may  not  be  developed  for  bases  where  the  housing  inventory  is  fully privatized. A limited HCP (up to 50 percent submittal) may be prepared for a base to be fully  privatized  if  the  limited  HCP  is  necessary  to  develop  the  privatization  project concept.   2.3.5.  General Officer Quarters (GOQ) Master Plan.  The Air Force developed the GOQ Master Plan to ensure MAJCOMs and bases appropriately plan, program and budget for the GOQ  requirement.  The  plan  contains  an  individual  facility  profile  (IFP)  for  each  GOQ, which  captures  facility  condition  data,  identifies  major  and  minor  M&R  requirements,  and provides  recommendations  and  cost  estimates  for  each  GOQ  based  on  a  whole-house perspective. The IFP is incorporated into the HCP and FHMP.   2.3.5.1.  Bases  and  MAJCOMs  must  ensure  GOQ  construction,  replacement,  and improvement  is  programmed  within  revitalization  projects  already  identified  in  the FHMP and that they are based on the GOQ Master Plan. (T-1) MAJCOMs and bases will program GOQ M&R, and investment requirements as whole-house improvement (P-713) or  replacement  (P-711)  projects.  (T-0)  Bases  must  comply  with  the  requirements identified in the IFP or seek approval from AF/A4CFH to deviate. (T-1)  2.3.5.2.  Bases  must  prepare  an  annual  5-year  plan  to  budget  for  GOQ  costs,  which  are supported by the IFP.  (T-1) 2.3.5.3.  Congress has established an annual GOQ OMR threshold of $35,000. The sum of  management  (P721.1),  services  (P-721.2),  furnishings  (P-721.4),  miscellaneous  (P-721.5) and M&R (P-722) annual expenditures for a GOQ cannot exceed $35,000 without prior  notification  to  Congress.  If  total  OMR  costs  exceed  the  threshold,  bases  must submit  notification  to  Congress  in  advance  of  the  work  being  performed  (Paragraph  2.9.3). (T-0) 2.3.5.4.  Bases  must  ensure  Major  M&R  and  minor  alteration  work  are  supported  by recommendations in the IFP. Out-of-cycle requests for such work may be submitted only when  the  work  is  for  safety,  health,  or  security  purposes  and  so  urgent  and  compelling that it cannot wait for the next annual budget submission. (T-1)  Bases must ensure Out-of-cycle  security  requests  are  supported  by  the  installation  Joint  Staff  Integrated Vulnerability Assessment (JSIVA).  (T-1) 2.3.5.5.  Refer  to  the  General  Officer  Quarters  Guide,  Volumes  1  and  2,  and  AFI  32-6003, General Officer Quarters, for additional policies and guidance for GOQs.   AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 11 2.3.6.  Surplus Housing: 2.3.6.1.  Dispose  of  surplus  inadequate  housing  IAW  the  HCP  and  the  FHMP  disposal plan. Requirements for approval of disposal/divestitures of FH units are provided in AFI 32-6001,  Family  Housing  Management  (also  see  AFI  32-9004,  Disposal  of  Real Property).   2.3.6.2.  Retain surplus adequate housing where the installation has maintained a 3-year average occupancy rate of 97 percent. Limit work on surplus adequate housing to health, safety  and  minimal  cosmetic  repairs,  and  dispose  of  at  the  end  of  the  useful operating/economic  life.  In  calculating  the  occupancy  rate  for  purposes  of  identifying surplus units to retain, remove units from the inventory that are undergoing M&R above that normally required for change of occupancy maintenance.   2.3.6.3.  M&R  funding  for  surplus  housing  M&R  expenditures  is  limited  to  $3,800  per unit  per  FY.  Bases  must  submit  all  expenditures  above  this  limit  to  the  The  Air  Force Director of Civil Engineers (AF/A4C) for review and approval. 2.3.6.4.  Surplus  housing  may  be  permanently  converted  to  other  uses.  Diversion (temporary  conversion)  of  surplus  housing  units  is  not  permitted.  Convert  only  units considered  adequate  based  on  the  current  HCP  condition  assessment  matrix  (CAM). However, units considered inadequate due only to functional suitability deficiencies, but otherwise  are  in  adequate  condition,  may  be  converted.  Permanent  conversions  change Air  Force  real  property  records  and  therefore  determine  the  source  of  funds  for  the conversion,  follow-on  maintenance,  repair  and  construction  work.  For  permanent conversion requests the MAJCOM and installation must demonstrate a valid need for the proposed new use. (T-1)     2.3.7.  Inadequate  Housing.  Bases may improve or replace inadequate housing only  if the housing requirement is validated by a current HRMA.   2.3.8.  Disposal/Divestiture.  MAJCOMs  must  include  in  the  FHMP  their  program  for disposal/divestiture  of  surplus  units  (as  defined  in  the  HRMA),  inadequate  units  that  are replaced via Military Construction (MILCON) and units conveyed as part of a privatization initiative.    2.3.8.1.  MAJCOM  Civil  Engineers disposals/divestitures  on  a  unit-by-unit  basis.  Requirements disposals/divestitures are provided in AFI 32-6001.   request  approval from  AF/A4C for  FH for  approval  of 2.3.8.2.  Bases must comply with:   2.3.8.2.1.  McKinney-Vento  Act  (Title  42  U.S.C.  §  11411)  before  disposing  of  any government-owned  units.  McKinney-Vento  Act  requires  the  identification  and publication of surplus housing to make the property available for application to assist the homeless. (T-0) 2.3.8.2.1.1.  Surplus  housing  disposed  of  through  a  privatization  initiative  is exempt from the provisions of the McKinney-Vento Act.   2.3.8.2.1.2.  Surplus housing may also be transferred to Operation Walking Shield according to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, section 2308. 12 AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 2.3.8.2.2.

Bases  are  restricted  from  undertaking  a  replacement, improvement,  minor improvement, major M&R or minor alteration project on a new or improved dwelling or non-dwelling unit within 3 years after initial occupancy. 2.4.1.1.  The 3-year limit does not apply when:   2.4.1.1.1.  A project addresses health, safety, or life-threatening situations.   2.4.1.1.2.  A  project  falls  under  the  auspices  of  a  larger  program  such  as  a  general energy-efficiency upgrade program.   2.4.1.1.3.  The work is necessary to prevent further damage to the dwelling following a natural disaster or other emergency.   2.4.1.2.  In other cases, including host nation funded new construction; MAJCOMs seek approval from AF/A4CFH by submitting Department of Defense (DD) Form 1391, FY__ Military  Construction  Project  Data,  with  full  justification  for  not  meeting  the  3-year limit.   2.4.1.3.  For self-help projects, AF/A4CFH waives the 3-year limit for projects less than $2,500.  The  waiver  is  for  simple,  minor  projects  such  as  installing  ceiling  fans,  fences and flowerbeds. The waiver is not intended for large projects such as kitchen or bathroom renovations.   2.4.2.  Programming size standards for constructing, acquiring and improving FH units are in Attachment 2.   2.4.3.  The Air Force Family Housing Guide gives general guidance for calculating gross/net floor areas.   2.4.4.  Housing  units  may  be  increased  above  the  programming  benchmark  for  new construction up to ten percent for the following housing categories:   2.4.4.1.  GOQ  occupied  by  an  incumbent  designated  by  OSD  as  a  Special  Command Position (SCP).   2.4.4.2.  Installation Commander.   2.4.4.3.  Command Chief (CCM) or Service equivalent residing on a military installation.   2.4.5.  Housing units may  be increased up to  300 net  square feet  (28 net  square meters) for indoor activity rooms in FH located in harsh climates. Bases in harsh climates are those with more  than  7,500  heating  degree-days  or  5,500  cooling  degree-days  annually  according  to UFC 3-40-02 Design: Engineering Weather data. Eligible bases with FH are listed in the Air Force Family Housing Guide.   2.4.6.  Outdoor  living  spaces  include  patios,  enclosed  patios,  decks,  lanais,  balconies,  back porches,  and  breezeways  (converted  to  enclosed  patios).  Front  entry  porches,  which  are typically part of the main entry of the house and are not enclosed, are not counted against the combined outdoor living  space limit,   unless they  are increased in  size and function, or are AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 13 connected  to  another  interior  or  exterior  living  area.  Size  limits  in  Table  1.1  apply  for combined outdoor living spaces:   Table 1.1.

(T-0)  FH  with  12  or  fewer  units  per  building  is  exempt  from  the  minimum  antiterrorism requirements in UFC 4-010-01. The DoD antiterrorism standards are minimum requirements. The  MAJCOMs  may  set  more  stringent  antiterrorism  building  standards  to  meet  specific threats  identified  and  justified  by  integrated  JSIVA,  or  MAJCOM,  service,  or  installation vulnerability assessments.   2.4.8.  Environmental requirements:   2.4.8.1.  Installations  shall  accomplish  the  planning  actions  called  for  in  AFI  32-1021 Planning  and  Programming  Military  Construction  (MILCON)  Projects  for  every MILCON project. (T-1)  2.4.8.1.1.  These  planning  results  should  be  approved  by  the  Installation  Facilities Board  before  obtaining  the  Certificate  of  Compliance  for  Critical  Planning  Actions (see AFI 32-1021, Paragraph 2.3) signed by the installation commander, documenting completion  of  these  actions.  MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs  review  these  certificates  to ensure  installations  have  fulfilled  all  compliance  requirements,  and  retain  them  for future  reference  and  use.  Although  this  certificate  is  only  completed  once, 14 AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs shall ensure required actions take place when and as needed.  (T-0) 2.4.8.2.  Installations  shall  comply  with  applicable  federal,  state,  interstate  and  local environmental  regulations,  as  well  as  DoD  and  Air  Force  environmental  policies. Examples include: underground storage tanks, asbestos, radon, lead-based paint and any other requirements as defined by environmental regulations (AFI 32-7001 Environmental Management). (T-0)  2.4.8.3.  Installations  shall  identify  requirements,  and  develop  plans  for  environmental compliance,  and  address  these  requirements  in  projects  to  maintain,  repair,  improve, replace  or  construct  FH,  using  applicable  housing  funds  (AFPD  32-70,  Environmental Quality).  (T-1) 2.4.8.4.  Installations  shall  ensure  completion  of  an  environmental  impact  analysis  in accordance  with  AFI  32-7062,  Comprehensive  Planning,  2  years  prior  to  the  program. (T-1) 2.4.8.5.  Installations  shall  complete  an  environmental  baseline  survey  IAW  AFI  32-7066,  Environmental  Baseline  Surveys  in  Real  Estate  Transactions  no  later  than  6 months before start of construction, and complete an environmental assessment IAW 32 CFR Part 989 no later than 12 months before start of construction.  (T-1) 2.4.8.6.  Installation shall comply with environmental restoration requirements contained in AFI 32-7020, The Environmental Restoration Program.  (T-1) 2.4.9.  Follow the following requirements for historic housing facilities:   2.4.9.1.  Use Military Family Housing (MFH) funds to maintain historic housing units in livable condition.   2.4.9.2.  Installations  must  consult  with  the  State  Historic  Preservation  Office  (SHPO), and  in  some  instances  the  Advisory  Council  on  Historic  Preservation  (ACHP),  before repairing, improving, renovating, or demolishing historic housing facilities.  Consultation is  complete  only  when  the  Air  Force,  SHPO,  and  ACHP  (if  applicable)  have  signed  a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Programmatic Agreement (PA) that resolves the adverse  effects  of the action.  The installation Cultural  Resource Manager and AFCEC, as  appropriate,  are  responsible  for  developing  MOAs  and  PAs.    (16  U.S.C.  §  470;  36 CFR 800, Protection of Historic Properties; AFI 32-7065). (T-0) 2.4.9.3.  Consider  major  upgrading  or  alternative  uses  of  historic  housing  or  support facilities  if  requirements  for  M&R  funds  become  excessive.    While  preservation  and alternate  uses  are  preferred,  demolition  is  appropriate  when  there  is  no  economically viable use for the structure.  2.4.10.  Installations  must  use  Housing  Community  Profiles  to  develop  M&R  project requirements.    Combine  requirements  identified  for  the  execution  FY  with  requirements identified  for  FY  +1  and  FY+2  to  create  a  3-year  requirement  project.  (T-1)    If  project exceeds  the  threshold  limits  (non-GOQ  FH  M&R  Threshold  (Paragraph    2.9.3.1))  then comply  with  Congressional  notification  requirements  (Paragraph    2.9.5).    Do  not  reduce scope  to  purposely  stay  beneath  the  Non-GOQ  Major  Maintenance  and  Repair  Threshold (Paragraph  2.9.4). (T-1) AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 15 2.4.10.1.  Do not split the “3-year requirement project” between an improvement project (P-713)  and  an  M&R  project  (P-722);  and  both  the  statutory  improvements  cost  limits and the M&R thresholds apply.  2.4.10.2.  For  GOQ  projects,  in  the  same  way,  combine  requirements  for  the  execution FY  and  requirements  identified  for  FY+1  and  FY+2  to  create  a  3-year  requirement project.    (T-1)    Do  not  reduce  scope  to  purposely  stay  beneath  the  GOQ  Major Maintenance and Repair Threshold (Paragraph  2.9.3.1). (T-1) 2.4.10.3.  For  P-713  improvement  projects  the  statutory  improvements  cost  limit (Paragraph    2.8.2)  applies  during  the  construction  period.  The  M&R  thresholds (Paragraph  2.9) resume after initial occupancy following project completion. 2.4.10.4.  Multiple  incremental  improvement  projects,  that  when  combined  together significantly alter a housing unit, are prohibited (Paragraph  2.8.3). 2.4.10.5.  Threshold limits apply per unit, not project. 2.4.11.  Lawn  irrigation  systems  may  be  included  for  housing  units  where  one  of  the following  conditions  exist:  (1)  Any  yard  size  for  personnel,  regardless  of  rank,  where  the average  annual  rainfall  is  less  than  20  inches  (arid  and  semi-arid  climates)  (see  approved listing of installations in the Air Force Family Housing Guide) according to UFC 3-400-02 Design: Engineering Weather Data or (2) the yard is one-half an acre or greater (lot size, less footprint of housing unit), regardless of rank.   2.4.11.1.  Lawn  irrigation  systems  for  GOQs  require  approval  by  the  Deputy  Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Environment, Safety and Infrastructure (SAF/IEE) prior to installation, regardless of criterion met or fund sources used.  2.4.12.  For  GOQ  improvement,  minor  improvement,  new  and  replacement,  and  M&R exceed  threshold  projects;  signatures  of  the  MAJCOM/A4  and  General  Officer  in  the resident’s chain of command are required on DD Form 1391c, MAJCOM CIVIL ENGINEER and  General  Officer  Certificate  for  GOQ  Projects,  (Attachment  4)  to  certify  the  project meets the GOQ Master Plan IFP. MAJCOMs and bases must use the  IFP recommendation, GOQ  Master  Plan,  local  GOQ  standards  and  the  projected  FHMP  investment  schedule  as guidelines  for  GOQ  investment.  (T-1).    If  there  are  compelling  or  unforeseen  reasons  that cause deviation from the GOQ IFP, bases must document the circumstances with a life-cycle cost  analysis,  and  provide  either  photos  or  other justification  supporting  early replacement/repair decisions.  (T-1) 2.4.13.  The number of units proposed in acquisition, privatization and construction projects should target the projected housing requirement as determined through the HRMA process.   2.4.13.1.  Ensure  the  number  of  new  units  proposed  in  acquisition,  privatization  and construction projects does not exceed 90 percent of the projected housing deficit.   2.5.  Approval Levels.  Attachment 3 shows project approval levels and delegation authority.   2.6.  Funding  Policy  (AFPD  65-5,  Cost  and  Economics;  AFPD  65-6,  Budget;  AFI  65-601, Volume  1,  Budget  Guidance  and  Procedures;  AFMAN  65-604,  Appropriation  Symbols  and Budget Codes): 16 AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 2.6.1.  Military  Family  Housing  (MFH)  Funds.  MAJCOMs and bases use MFH funds to acquire, construct, replace, improve, operate, lease, maintain and repair housing and ancillary support facilities. Ancillary housing support facilities include:   2.6.1.1.  Housing  Management  offices,  maintenance  facilities  and  supply  and  storage facilities (self-help stores).   2.6.1.2.  Recreational,  athletic  and  other  community  support  facilities  and  infrastructure located in FH areas for the exclusive use by housing area residents.   2.6.1.3.  Utility  distribution  systems  and  associated  protective  or  control  devices, including transformers, switch gears, manholes and hydrants located in FH areas for the exclusive support of the housing area.   2.6.2.  Fund Types: 2.6.2.1.  P-711.  New  construction  funds  used  to  acquire,  construct  and  replace  housing; funds  also  used  to  demolish  FH  units  and  ancillary  support  facilities,  when  they  are associated with a replacement or construction project.   2.6.2.2.

P-722.  M&R  funds  used  to  maintain  and  repair  government-owned  FH;  also used  to  demolish  FH  units  and  ancillary  support  facilities  when  not  associated  with  a replacement or improvement project, and may also be design funds for M&R projects.   2.6.2.6.  P-723/724/725/726. Leasing funds used to lease, operate and maintain leased FH units and ancillary support facilities.   2.6.2.7.  P-727. Privatization funds used to cover costs associated with the identification, definition, acquisition, oversight and execution of FH privatization projects (Paragraph  2.12).   2.6.2.8.  P-728. Utilities funds used to cover the costs of utilities.   2.6.2.9.  DoD  Family  Housing  Improvement  Funds  (FHIF)  used  to  acquire,  construct, replace and improve FH units and ancillary support facilities under the military housing privatization program. New construction funds (P-711) and improvement funds (P-713), are transferred to DoD FHIF by the OSD Comptroller for FH privatization projects.   2.6.3.  Funding  FH  Communications.  MFH  funds  are  used  to  fund  permanently  installed equipment  to  meet  communications  requirements,  such  as  fiber  optic  cables.  Distribution branch lines, exclusively used by housing, are funded with MFH funds. Use non-MFH funds to pay for  Communications equipment that is readily removable and mission-required.   2.6.4.  Prohibition  of  Non-MFH  M&R  Funding  for  FH  M&R.  The  annual  DoD Appropriations  Act  prohibits  the  use  of  base  O&M  funds  (Element  of  Expense/Investment Code [EEIC] 521, 522, 524) to maintain and repair FH units, including any areas within the AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 17 FH  unit  used  to  conduct  official  DoD  business.  The  annual  Military  Construction Appropriations Act requires that FH O&M funds are the exclusive source of funds for M&R of all FH units.   2.6.5.  Diverted (temporarily converted) Units. Use M&R (P-722) funds to maintain FH units diverted for other uses.   2.6.6.  Funding  Antiterrorism  and  Force  Protection  Requirements.  Use  MFH  funds  for antiterrorism measures required exclusively for FH (Paragraph  2.4.7).   2.7.  New and Replacement Construction Program (P-711 Funds): 2.7.1.  Authority.  The  Air  Force  may  acquire,  construct  or  replace  FH  units  and  ancillary support facilities under the authority of 10 U.S.C. § 2821-2824.   2.7.2.  Congressional Authorization and Appropriation.  Congress approves, by line item, new and replacement construction projects.   2.7.3.  Economic  Analysis  (EA).  An  EA  is  required  to  support  new  construction requirements.    When  a  repair  by  replacement  project  is  being  considered,  MAJCOMs  and bases must develop an EA or an EA Waiver if the estimated repair cost exceeds 75% of the FH unit replacement cost (AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis).  (T-1) 2.7.4.  Compliance with the Family Housing Master Plan (FHMP).  For nonhistoric units, when  total  repair  and/or  improvement  costs  exceed  75  percent  of  the  replacement  cost,  as identified  in  the  FHMP,  a  housing  project  is  programmed  as  a  replacement  construction project. New construction must address deficits identified in the FHMP. AF/A4CF advocates for  funding  according  to  the  FHMP  priorities.  MAJCOMs  and  bases  develop  projects  for each location. Additionally, MAJCOMs and bases must ensure these projects follow and are compliant with the FHMP and GOQ Master Plans.  (T-1) 2.7.5.  Major  Land  Acquisition  Approval.    DODI  4165.71  Real  Property  Acquisition established the major land acquisition approval  requirement.  Obtain OSD approval  for any land purchase, lease, permit or other agreement exceeding 1,000 acres in size or $1M in cost.  MAJCOM  must  obtain  approval  prior  to  submitting  any  project  involving  major  land acquisition  in  the  applicable  Budget  Estimate  Submission  (BES).    The  Directorate  of Installation  Center  of  Excellence  of  Air  Force  Civil  Engineer  Center  (AFCEC/CI)  is responsible for processing the approval request.  2.7.6.  Prohibition  of  Advance  Land  Acquisition  and  Site  Preparation.  Congress prohibits any funds to be used solely to (1) acquire land, (2) provide for site preparation, or (3) install utilities for any FH units, unless the housing units are authorized by law and funds for such units are appropriated.   2.7.7.  Project  Documentation.  For  each  project,  submit  the  following  forms  to  AF/A4CF for approval:   2.7.7.1.  DD  Form  1391  and  DOD  Cost  Model  for  new  and  replacement  construction projects (see Attachment 4 for sample forms).   2.7.7.2.  DD  Form  1523,  Military  Family  Housing  Justification,  for  acquisition  projects (see Attachment 4 for sample forms).   18 AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 2.7.7.3.  DD  Form  1391,  Sample  Deficiency  Detail  Data  (DDD)  Sheets  for  Support Facilities Projects (see Attachment 4 for sample forms).   2.8.  Improvement Program (P-713 Funds): 2.8.1.  Overview.  This  program  improves  the  existing  FH  inventory  to  meet  whole-house and whole-neighborhood standards and covers required M&R to extend the life of the house for 25 years. Improvement projects include:   2.8.1.1.  Altering, adding, expanding, or extending the life of an existing housing facility.   2.8.1.2.  Upgrading  related  housing  support  facilities  such  as  housing  management offices and housing maintenance facilities.   2.8.1.3.  Upgrading or constructing other exclusive-use community support facilities such as parking areas, utilities, bus shelters and playgrounds.   2.8.1.4.  Upgrading exclusive-use utility distribution systems such as electric, gas, water and sewage disposal.   2.8.2.  Statutory  Limit  for  Improvement  Cost.  Congress  sets  the statutory unit-cost  limit for housing improvements and concurrent M&R (10 U.S.C. § 2825).   2.8.2.1.  Congress set the current limit at:   2.8.2.1.1.  A  cost  of  $50,000,  multiplied  by  the  area  cost  factor  (ACF),  per  housing unit at the time of the contract award.   2.8.2.1.2.  A cost of $60,000, multiplied by the ACF, per housing unit at the time of the  contract  award  for  improvements  necessary  to  make  the  unit  suitable  for handicapped family members.   2.8.2.2.  For  foreign  source  housing  units,  the  three-year  limitation  is  $35,000,  base should  program  three-year  requirements  in  one  year  when  they  exceed  $35,000  and request waiver in the annual budget request. 2.8.2.2.1.  Cost increase after contract award resulting from varying foreign currency exchange rate do not constitute a violation of this limit. 2.8.2.3.  This  limit  does  not  apply  to  projects  authorized  for  restoring  or  replacing damaged or destroyed housing units. 2.8.2.4.  Exclusions for communications, security and antiterrorism equipment. The costs associated with  the installation, maintenance, or  repair of communications, security and antiterrorism  equipment  required  by  the  resident  in  the  performance  of  assigned  duties can  be  excluded  from  the  application  of  the  statutory  improvement  cost  limit  (See Paragraph  2.9.2.5).   2.8.2.5.  Waivers to statutory improvement cost limit:   2.8.2.5.1.  AF/A4CF issues a call letter to MAJCOMs every year to prepare the BES. MAJCOMs  identify  those  improvement  projects  where  the  costs  of  the  most expensive unit (See Paragraph  5.3.5.4) exceed the statutory improvement cost limit. Projects are included in the annual President’s Budget (PB) for approval by Congress. See the Air Force Family Housing Guide for a timeline.   AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 19 2.8.2.5.2.  To  request  a  waiver,  bases  must  perform  an  EA  IAW  AFI  65-501 Economic Analysis  and show improving the facility is more cost effective than other alternatives. (T-0)    2.8.2.5.3.  SAF/IEE  is  the  approval  authority  to  waive  the  cost  limit  after  a  21-day congressional  notification  period.  For  out-of-cycle  requests,  the  congressional notification  package  includes  a  “marked-up”  DD  Form  1391  showing  the  cost revisions  to  the  original  document  and  an  EA.  Following  the  21-day  notification period,  if  there  are  no  congressional  objections  or  concerns,  the  Air  Force  is authorized to proceed.   2.8.3.  Programming Improvement Projects: 2.8.3.1.  Program improvement projects to whole-house and whole-neighborhood criteria, even if the projected costs exceed the statutory improvement cost limit. If projected costs exceed the limit, bases must perform an EA to determine whether to program the project under the improvement program or the construction (replacement) program. Identify rank and bedroom mix on the DD Form 1391.  (T-1) 2.8.3.2.  Program  improvements and necessary M&R work, as well as minor alterations aimed  at  bringing  units  up  to  whole-house  standards.  Ensure  improvement  projects comply with the base HCP.    2.8.4.  Programming Minor Improvement Projects (MIP): 2.8.4.1.  Plan  minor  improvement  projects  for  low-cost,  small-scale  projects  to  improve existing housing facilities or housing community areas to include concurrent maintenance or repair work.   2.8.4.2.  A  minor  improvement  project  (P-713)  is  defined  as  an  improvement  project where  the  per-unit  cost  does  not  exceed  the  statutory  improvement  cost  limit.  In calculating  the  statutory  improvement  cost  limit,  include  the  total  cost  of  improvement, major M&R and minor alteration work planned or accomplished during the current FY.   2.8.5.  Out-of-Cycle Improvement Projects: 2.8.5.1.  MAJCOMs  may  apply  to  AF/A4CF  for  approval  of  urgent,  out-of-cycle requirements that address safety, health or other life-threatening issues.   2.8.5.2.  SAF/IEE  is  the  approval  authority  for  requests  for  out-of-cycle  improvements, contingent  on  the  availability  of  funds.  Out-of-cycle  improvement  projects  may  not exceed the improvement cost limit.   2.8.6.  Conjunctive  Funding  for  Host  Nation  Funded  Projects.  When  a  host  nation government funds housing construction to meet Air Force housing requirements at less than Air  Force  standards,  the  installation  then  programs  an  improvement  project  (P-713)  to provide  the  conjunctive  funding  required  for  constructing  housing  to  Air  Force  standards. The conjunctive funding requirement is programmed to coincide with the host nation funded program year.   2.8.7.  Improvement  Project  Approval  Levels.  Improvement  projects  approval  levels  are listed in Attachment 3.   20 AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 2.8.8.  Improvement  Project  Form.  See  Attachment  4  for  a  sample  of  DD  Form  1391, Improvement Projects.   2.9.  Maintenance and Repair (M&R) Program (P-722 Funds): 2.9.1.  Authority  and  Overview.  The  Air  Force  may  maintain  and  repair  FH  units  and ancillary  support  facilities  under  the  authority  of  10  U.S.C.  §  2833.  This  program  covers minor  alterations  and  major  and  minor  M&R  (Attachment  1,  Terms)  required  to  preserve FH units and support facilities, and also covers M&R thresholds (Attachment 3).   2.9.2.  Minor  Alterations.  Minor  alteration  is  construction-type  work  normally  performed in support of an M&R project.   2.9.2.1.  Minor alteration projects can improve housing units, support facilities and streets (including sidewalks), parking areas, utility systems and recreation facilities. Fund minor alteration projects with P-722 funds and use the approval limits listed in Attachment 3.   2.9.2.2.  Do not use minor alteration authority to increase the size of a unit or the number of rooms in a unit.   2.9.2.3.  MAJCOM Authority: 2.9.2.3.1.  Non-GOQs.  MAJCOM/A4Cs  are  authorized  to  approve  non-GOQ  FH minor  alterations  costing  less  than  $7,500  annually  per  unit  and  less  than  $750,000 per  project  using  FH  O&M  (P-722)  funds.  Generally,  this  authority  is  used concurrently with the repair of FH units; however, some circumstances may warrant the  use  of  the  authority  without  repair.  This  authority  can  be  used  for  interior  and exterior work consistent with the Air Force Family Housing Guide.   2.9.2.3.2.  GOQs. MAJCOM/A4Cs are authorized to approve GOQ minor alterations for interior  and  exterior work consistent with  Air Force GOQ standards  and the Air Force GOQ Master Plan. Minor alteration work on GOQs can be accomplished up to $3,000 annually and the MAJCOM can delegate this authority to the installation Base Civil  Engineer  (BCE).  Minor  alteration  work  exceeding  $3,000  and  up  to  but  not exceeding  $7,500  annually,  requires  MAJCOM  Vice  Commander  (MAJCOM/CV) approval.  No  general  officer  can  approve  work  on  his/her  own  unit.  For  single installation MAJCOMs and Direct Reporting Units (DRU), the approval authority is the Air Force Assistant Vice Chief of Staff (AF/CVA). For MAJCOM Commanders (MAJCOM/CC)  or  other  O-10s,  the  approval  authority  is  Air  Force  Vice  Chief  of Staff  (AF/CV).  Minor  alterations  to  a  GOQ  must  be  properly  documented  in  the annual  GOQ  cost  report  submitted  to  Congress  (T-0),  and  must  be  accomplished within the GOQ OMR threshold. (T-1)    2.9.2.4.  Non-Dwelling  Units.  Subject  to  the  approval  limits  in  Attachment  3,  use  the minor alteration authority on non-dwelling units to increase the size of the facility, extend streets, construct new parking areas, increase the capacity of utility systems and expand recreation areas.   2.9.2.5.  Antiterrorism/Force  protection  FH  Communications  Exclusion.  Antiterrorism and  mission-related,  permanently  installed  communications  requirements  for  FH dwelling  units  are  not  subject  to  the  minor  alteration  limits,  but  do  count  against  the annual O&M limit. Identify antiterrorism requirements subject to this exclusion through AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 21 JSIVA, or MAJCOM, Service, or installation vulnerability assessments, and ensure they are  approved  by  the  installation  commander.  Documentation  of  the  assessment  and approval  for  antiterrorism  requirements  should  be  kept  on  file  with  project  approval documentation. Antiterrorism and communications work is still subject to the GOQ and non-GOQ M&R thresholds.     2.9.2.6.  MAJCOMs and bases track the cost and scope of work for minor alterations to ensure  the  per-unit  and  per-project  limits  are  not  exceeded  (Attachment  3)  and  that  no restrictions are violated.  (T-1) 2.9.3.  GOQ  Maintenance  and  Repair  (M&R),  and  Operations,  Maintenance  and Repair (OMR) Annual Thresholds.  There are two statutory limitations (10 U.S.C. § 2831 and annually recurring provisions in the Military Construction Appropriation Acts) that limit the annual expenditure of the following funds on any GOQ:   2.9.3.1.  M&R  Threshold.  Military  Construction  Appropriation  Acts  place  an  annual ceiling of $35,000 on M&R expenditures per GOQ, per FY. GOQ expenditures counted against the M&R annual limit include change of occupancy, minor/routine M&R, major M&R,  grounds  maintenance  and  minor  alterations.  FY05  MILCON  Appropriation  Act allows for after-the-fact notification based on unforeseen environmental remediation.   2.9.3.2.  OMR  Threshold.  10  U.S.C.  §  2831  placed  a  ceiling  of  $35,000  on  OMR expenditures per GOQ, per FY. GOQ expenditures counted against the OMR annual limit include  management  (P-721.1),  services  (P-721.2),  furnishings  (P-721.4)  and  M&R  (P-722).  M&R  expenditures  include  change  of  occupancy,  minor/routine  M&R,  major M&R, grounds maintenance and minor alterations. 10 U.S.C. § 2831 allows for after-the-fact notification based on unforeseen environmental remediation or safety and security as defined  below.  Congressional  report  language  explaining  10  U.S.C.  §  2831  allows restoration costs for GOQ historical features, which are exempted from the annual OMR limit. These costs are counted against the annual M&R limit and may not be waived.  2.9.3.3.  The M&R or OMR thresholds may not be exceeded without prior notification to Congress or approval to notify Congress after-the fact. An after-the-fact notification may only be  accomplished if  the requirement  arose  after the PB was submitted. Approval  to notify  the  Congress  after-the-fact  is  restricted  to  unforeseen  environmental  remediation (M&R  or  OMR  threshold)  or  resident  safety  and  security  (OMR  threshold  only)  as defined below.  2.9.3.3.1.  Exception  for  Environmental  Remediation.  The  Military  Construction Appropriation Acts and 10 U.S.C. § 2831 allow after-the-fact notification to Congress if  the  GOQ  annual  M&R  or  OMR  threshold  ($35,000  or  as  notified)  is  exceeded solely  due  to  costs  associated  with  unforeseen  environmental  remediation  costs resulting from an on-going M&R action. Work executed under this exemption should be  limited  to  that  required  to  ensure  resident  safety  and  health  from  environmental conditions.   2.9.3.3.1.1.  The MAJCOM Civil Engineer is the approval authority to exceed the annual M&R or OMR limit ($35,000 or as notified).   2.9.3.3.1.2.  MAJCOMs  will  notify  the  Air  Force  Director  of  Civil  Engineers, Operations Division (AF/A4CF) within 15 days of approval to exceed the annual 22 AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 M&R  or  OMR  limit  due  to  unforeseen  environmental  hazard  remediation.  The notification package includes a copy of the approval letter plus a DD Form 1391 (with backup detailed cost estimates) documenting revised project costs including the  planned  remediation  plan,  start  date  of  the  original  M&R  project  (prior  to discovery of the remediation work) and a summary of current and projected end-of-the-year  OMR  costs  for  the  GOQ.  If  approved,  MAJCOM  Civil  Engineer provides a copy of the approval letter to the installation.   2.9.3.3.1.3.  File  a  copy  of  the  after-the-fact  notification  approval  memo  in  the GOQ project folder and the GOQ cost report files.   2.9.3.3.1.4.  Submit  a  copy  of  the  after-the-fact  notification  approval  memo  to  AF/A4CFH with the annual cost report for the GOQ.   2.9.3.3.1.5.  SAF/IEE notifies Congress after the fact, as required.   2.9.3.3.2.  Exception for Safety and Security. Provided that the GOQ M&R threshold is not also exceeded, 10 U.S.C. § 2831 allows after-the-fact notification to Congress if  the  annual  GOQ  OMR  limit  ($35,000  or  as  notified)  is  exceeded  to  protect  the safety  and  security  of  the  residents  or  because  of  a  combination  of  environmental remediation  and  safety  and  security  costs.  Since  the  recurring  Military  Construction Appropriation Act does not allow for this exception, this authority cannot be used to notify  Congress  after-the-fact  of  exceeding  the  M&R  limit  ($35,000  or  as  notified). This  exception  is  provided  to  allow  the  Services  to  respond  in  a  timely  manner  to correct imminent, documented threats to GOQ resident safety or security. Appropriate documentation of the requirement and its urgency should include Antiterrorism/Force Protection or threat assessments, JSIVA reports, and Risk Assessment Codes (RAC) and/or safety evaluation reports.   2.9.3.3.2.1.  The MAJCOM Civil Engineer is the approval authority to exceed the $35,000 OMR limit due to resident safety and security issues. This authority may not be used to exceed the $35K M&R limit. Ensure approval is obtained prior to starting  any  work  that  causes  the  GOQ  annual  OMR  costs  to  exceed  the  annual limit. MAJCOMs provide a copy of the approval memo to the installation.     2.9.3.3.2.2.  MAJCOMs must notify AF/A4C within 15 days of MAJCOM Civil Engineer  approval  to  exceed  the  $35,000  OMR  limit  for  resident  safety  or security.  Ensure  the  notification  package  includes  a  copy  of  the  exception approval memo, detailed documentation of the safety or security issue (e.g., safety reports, threat evaluations, JSIVA report), a DD Form 1391 (with backup detailed cost  estimates),  and  a  summary  of  current  and  projected  end-of-the-year  OMR costs for the GOQ.    2.9.3.3.2.3.  File  a  copy  of  the  after-the-fact  notification  approval  memo  in  the GOQ project folder and the OMR cost files.    2.9.3.3.2.4.  Submit  a copy of the after-the-fact  notification approval  memo  with the annual cost report for the GOQ.    2.9.3.3.2.5.  SAF/IEE notifies Congress after the fact, as required.   AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 23 2.9.3.3.3.  Historical  Restoration  Costs.  Report  costs  for  restoration  of  GOQs historical features as part of the annual M&R costs; however, they can be exempted from counting against the 10 U.S.C. § 2831 OMR limit (due to Congressional report language  explanations).  Work  on  any  other  system  or  component  not  specifically identified as a historical feature is charged to the annual OMR limit. All M&R costs (for  historical  features  or  otherwise)  count  against  the  Military  Construction Appropriation  Acts  M&R  limit.  SAF/IEE  is  the  approval  authority  for  historical restoration  exemptions.  Work  to  repair,  maintain  or  replace  historical  features  on GOQs eligible for or currently on the historical register can qualify for this exclusion. To qualify for this exemption, ensure the historical features cited must be reflected in appropriate SHPO documents (see 2.9.3.3.3.2 below).   2.9.3.3.3.1.  SAF/IEE  is  the  approval  authority  to  exempt  work  on  historical features from the annual OMR limit. Approval to exempt work of this type must be  obtained  prior  to  starting  any  work  that  will  causes  the  GOQ  annual  OMR costs to exceed the OMR limit.  2.9.3.3.3.2.  Forward  requests  for  SAF/IEE  approval  to  AF/A4C  for  processing. Ensure  the  request  package  includes  a  copy  of  the  SHPO  documents  validating the items being worked on are historical features, a DD Form 1391 (with backup detailed  cost  estimates),  and  a  summary  of  current  and  projected  end-of-year OMR  costs for the GOQ.  If approved,  AF/A4C provides a  copy of the approval letter to the MAJCOM.  2.9.3.3.3.3.  File  a  copy  of  the  exception  approval  memo  in  the  GOQ  project folder and the OMR cost files.     2.9.3.3.3.4.  Submit a copy of the exception approval memo with the annual cost report for the GOQ.     2.9.4.  Non-GOQ Major Maintenance and Repair (M&R) Threshold: 2.9.4.1.  This threshold is set at $20,000 per unit, and:   2.9.4.1.1.  Places  an  annual  obligation  limit  on  major  M&R  and  alteration  work, accomplished by job order, work order or contract; on non-GOQ units.   2.9.4.1.2.  Excludes costs for design and contract claims.   2.9.4.1.3.  Applies  to  the  cost  of  housing  units  and  ancillary  support  facilities  up  to the 5-foot (1.5 meters) line outside of the housing unit and any support facility.   2.9.4.2.  Exception for Environmental Hazard Remediation for Non-GOQs:   2.9.4.2.1.  The  cost  to  correct  unforeseen  environmental  hazards,  such  as  removing asbestos,  mitigating  radon,  removing  and  abating  lead-based  paint  and  correcting other  known  legislative  environmental  hazards  in  an  on-going  contract  may  exceed M&R  thresholds.  MAJCOMs  must  notify  AF/A4CF  at  the  end  of  March  and September  each  year,  listing  each  instance  where  M&R  thresholds  were  exceeded because  of  unforeseen  environmental  hazard  remediation.  Ensure  the  notification package includes a DD Form 1391 with backup detailed cost estimates documenting revised project costs including the planned remediation and a summary of current and projected end-of-year M&R costs for the non-GOQ.  24 AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 2.9.4.2.2.  SAF/IEE notifies Congress after the fact, as required.   2.9.5.  Funding and Budget Constraints: 2.9.5.1.  Address significant needs in all categories of FH, including GOQs, with limited housing O&M budgets. The Air Force does not budget for nor does it expect to spend the full amount of the GOQ or Non-GOQ annual thresholds annually on each unit.   2.9.5.2.  An M&R project is defined as a project to maintain and restore a facility, system or  component  to  such  a  condition  that  it  can  be  used  for  its  originally  designated functional purpose. 2.9.5.2.1.  In  determining  the  total  cost  for  approval  and  notification  purpose,  an M&R project applies aggregate (FY +2) M&R requirements and all phases of a multi-year M&R project to a single facility, system or component. 2.9.5.2.2.  An  M&R  project  cannot  be  programmed  to  provide  new  facilities, additions  to  existing  facilities,  or  functional  conversions  that  expand  footprint  or functional space or change the function of a space. 2.9.5.2.3.  For  infrastructure  (including  utility  system)  project,  a  facility,  system  or component is defined by a category group such as 811 (electrical power generation), 812  (electrical  distribution  system),  831  (water  treatment  &  disposal),  832  (sanitary sewer), 841 (water supply treatment  & storage),  843 (fire hydrants), and  871 (storm sewer)  etc.    Similar  facility,  system,  and  component  that  service  a  discreet  function should be grouped in one project.  It may be programmed to more than one project if it is non-contiguous, non-adjacent, and geographically separated and each services its function  independently.    Different  utility  systems  may  be  programmed  in  a  project when they are feasible and cost effective to bundle together. 2.9.5.3.  AF/A4CF  issues  a  call  letter  to  MAJCOMs  each  year  to  prepare  the  BES. MAJCOMs identify those M&R projects where GOQ and non-GOQ thresholds are to be exceeded. Projects are included in the annual PB for approval by Congress.   2.9.5.3.1.  Execute  work  approved  over  the  GOQs  and  non-GOQs  M&R  thresholds no later than 1 year following the program year.   2.9.5.3.2.  Do  not  exceed  the  annual  M&R  and  OMR  thresholds  for  GOQs  until Congress  has  approved  the  PB.    After  approval  to  exceed  GOQ  M&R  or  OMR threshold  is  received,  MAJCOM  Civil  Engineers  must  provide  to  AF/A4C  on  1 September of the budget year a list of all projects that have not been awarded yet.  For each project, ensure the list includes the reasons why it has not been awarded and the plans to award the project in the remaining portion of the budget year.  The base level project file will include a copy of this list. (T-2)   2.9.5.3.3.  Do  not  increase  the  per-unit  cost  threshold  for  non-GOQs  more  than  five percent  without  prior  written  approval  by  AF/A4C.  AF/A4C  may  only  approve  an increase  in  project  costs  by  up  to  25  percent  of  the  high  unit  cost  (HUC)  (See Paragraph    5.3.5.4)  and  the  total  project  cost  cannot  exceed  25  percent  of  the approved project threshold.   AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 25 2.9.5.3.4.  The  project  scope  may  be  reduced  for  non-GOQs  by  up  to  25  percent  of the  project  previously  notified  to  Congress.  However,  the  project  scope  may  not  be reduced when costs are increased above per-unit or project cost thresholds.   2.9.5.3.5.  Do  not  exceed  the  25  percent  flexibility  for  non-GOQs  without  prior congressional renotification.  2.9.6.  Out-of-Cycle Notification to Exceed GOQ or Non-GOQ M&R Thresholds. 2.9.6.1.  In  the  year  of  execution,  the  BCE,  with  GOQ  resident  assistance,  prioritizes requirements to  stay within  the monetary limit.  If unforeseen urgent  requirements arise, consider  deferring  other  less  critical  work  to  stay  within  the  GOQ  and  non-GOQ thresholds.  Out-of-cycle  requests  to  exceed  the  GOQ  and  non-GOQ  thresholds  are considered only in extraordinary circumstances.   2.9.6.1.1.  GOQ  out-of-cycle  budget  submissions  are  allowed  only  when  there  is  an extremely urgent situation, typically relating to risks to health, life or safety. Out-of-cycle requests are limited to proposed work so urgent and compelling it cannot wait for the next annual budget submission; it could not reasonably have been foreseen at the  time  of  budget  submission;  cost  of  the  work  causes  the  GOQ  to  exceed  the $35,000  OMR  limit  and  possibly  the  M&R  limit;  and  work  does  not  constitute  an alteration, addition or improvement.  2.9.6.1.2.  Out-of-cycle  requests  to  exceed  the  $35,000  limit  are  scrutinized  by numerous Air Staff and Air Force Secretariat officials. After-the-fact notifications are not allowed except as described in paragraph 2.9.3. SAF/IE must review and approve out-of-cycle  notifications.  Approved  requests  are  then  submitted  to  Congress  for notification. Congress has 30 days to act on the notification to exceed the M&R limit. Time  periods  for  notification  to  exceed  the  OMR  limit  only,  may  be  shorter. Submissions should include:  (T-0)   2.9.6.1.2.1.  Strong  justification  for  why  work  is  being  done  out-of-cycle, including  reasons  the  requirement  was  not  included  in  the  budget  submission, urgency and impact of the delay.  (T-1) 2.9.6.1.2.2.  Comprehensive narrative for each GOQ project, including validation the  work  is  identified  in  the  GOQ  IFP.  If  the  work  is  not  included  in  the  GOQ plan, provide a detailed explanation of the work.   2.9.6.1.2.3.  A  completed  DD  Form  1391  to  show  specific  project  work  to  be accomplished on the unit and to identify costs additional to the threshold.   2.9.6.1.2.4.  Detailed cost breakout (including line item details).   2.9.6.1.2.5.  Photographs depicting repair requirements.   2.9.6.1.2.6.  A statement signed by the GOQ resident acknowledging the work.   2.9.6.1.2.7.  A  project  certification  statement  signed  by  the  MAJCOM  Civil Engineer.   2.9.6.1.2.8.  Detailed breakout of other anticipated costs for the FY, including, but not limited to, specific projects approved by SAF/IEE and all OMR costs.   26 AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 2.9.6.2.  MAJCOMs  may  apply  to  AF/A4CFH  for  consideration  of  urgent  M&R requirements. Include DD Form 1391 in supporting documentation, and explain why the MAJCOM  did  not  identify  the  requirement  for  budget  submission,  the  urgency  of  the requirement  and  the  impact  of  the  delay.  SAF/IEE  is  the  approval  authority  for  out-of-cycle projects and notifies Congress.   2.9.6.3.  Congress  limits  submission  of  out-of-cycle  M&R  projects  exceeding  the  GOQ M&R threshold to once per  year. GOQ out-of-cycle notification may be submitted only for  emergency  requirements  (health,  safety,  or  life-threatening  conditions).  AF/A4CF initiates a project call to MAJCOMs near the FY midpoint.   2.9.7.  Self-Help Work.  Self-help work is for simple, minor M&R projects (including minor alteration)  on  government-owned  FH  units,  and  is  not  intended  for  large  or  complicated improvement or replacement projects. Self-help  projects are funded with MFH O&M funds and should not exceed $2,500. BCE ensures self-help work complies with Air Force housing standards  and  appropriate  codes,  safety  and  functionality.  (T-1).  If  the  BCE  approves  self-help  projects  with  the  condition  that  the  unit  is  returned  to  its  original  configuration,  the resident is responsible for restoring the unit to its original condition before clearing the unit. The cost of self-help work combined with other minor alteration and M&R work performed by  contracts  or  service  orders  may  not  exceed  approval  levels,  Air  Force  size  standards, improvement cost limits, or (for GOQs) annual GOQ or non-GOQ thresholds.  2.9.8.  Common Utility Infrastructure.  For maintenance, repair and minor alteration, only the first 5 feet of utility infrastructure, measured from the footprint of the unit, are considered dwelling  costs.  Utilities include  water,  electricity,  gas,  wastewater,  stormwater, communications and alarm systems. This does not apply to the alarm system itself, but does apply  to  communications  lines  connecting  the  alarm  to  a  central  off-site  system.  For driveways  and  sidewalks  exclusively  serving  a  specific  dwelling,  all  costs  are  considered  a dwelling  cost  and  subject  to  the  appropriate  limits.  MAJCOMs  and  bases  must  count  all dwelling costs towards the GOQ and non-GOQ M&R thresholds.  (T-1)   2.9.9.  Sample Forms.  See Attachment 4 for sample DD Form 1391, M&R Project.   2.10.  Foreign  Lease  Program  (P-723/724  Funds).  The  Air  Force  may  lease  FH  in  a  foreign country  under  the  authority  of  10  U.S.C.  §  2828(c)  and  10  U.S.C.  §  2834.  See  AFI  32-6001, Chapter 10.  2.11.  Domestic  Lease  Program  (P-725/726  Funds).  The  Air  Force  may  lease  FH  units constructed  or  rehabilitated  near  a  military  installation  within  the  United  States  under  the authority of 10 U.S.C. § 2828(a). See AFI 32-6001, Chapter 10.  2.12.  Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI): 2.12.1.  Authority.  The Air Force may use a wide variety of guarantees, leases, investments and loans to provide for the acquisition or construction of FH and ancillary support facilities by private developers, using the authority of 10 U.S.C. Chapter 169, Subchapter IV, § 2871 through  §  2885.  The  authority  is  limited  to  the  United  States  and  its  territories  (foreign locations excluded). Authority includes the following:   2.12.1.1.  Utilities and Services.   2.12.1.2.  Direct loans and loan guarantees.   AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 27 2.12.1.3.  Leasing of housing.   2.12.1.4.  Investments.   2.12.1.5.  Rental guarantees.   2.12.1.6.  Differential lease payments.   2.12.1.7.  Conveyance or lease of existing properties and facilities.   2.12.2.  Housing Privatization Responsibilities: 2.12.2.1.  AF/A4CFH  provides  program  management  and  oversight,  and  is  the  liaison between  the  Air  Force  and  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Undersecretary  of  Defense, Installations  and  Environment,  Facilities,  Energy  and  Privatization  directorate,  the advocate for Air Force projects.   2.12.2.2.  AF/A4CFH validates housing requirements and developing housing programs, including  privatization  projects,  consistent  with  the  Air  Force  FHMP.  AF/A4CFH  also works jointly with MAJCOMs to determine whether to execute housing requirements as a privatization initiative or as a traditional military construction project.   2.12.2.3.  MAJCOMs  and  installations  develop  housing  requirements  and  identify potential  privatization  projects,  and  may  play  an  extensive  or  limited  role  in  executing privatization projects, depending on the authority or combination of authorities used.   2.12.3.  Congressional Notification: 2.12.3.1.  Proposal  Solicitation.  SAF/IEE  and  the  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air Force, Budget (SAF/FMB) provide congressional notification 30 days prior to soliciting privatization  request  for  proposals.  AF/A4CFH  coordinates  notification  packages  with the  Air  Force  Civil  Engineer  Center,  prior  to  staffing  for  SAF/IEE  and  SAF/FMB signature and notification to Congress of Air Force intent to solicit a project.   2.12.3.2.  Contract  Award  and  Transfer  of  Funds.  Contract  award  and  transfer  of  funds notifications  are  two  separate  and  distinct  congressional  notifications.  Per  10  U.S.C.  § 2871,  the  term  “contract”  includes  any  contract,  lease  or  other  agreement  entered  into under the privatization authorities. The Air Force closes a real estate transaction or deal, with  a  private  sector  developer  as  opposed  to  awarding  a  contract.  Prior  to  closing  a privatization  deal  the  legislation  requires  a  congressional  notification  with  a  30-day waiting  period.  AF/A4CFH  coordinates  notification  packages  with  AFCEC  prior  to staffing  for  SAF/IEE  and  SAF/FMB  signature  and  notification  to  Congress  of  the  Air Force intent to close a deal. If required to support the privatization project, appropriated funds  (P-711  and/or  P-713)  are  transferred  to  the  DoD  Family  Housing  Improvement Fund (FHIF) prior to project closing. A congressional notification and a 30-day waiting period are required before P-711 and /or P-713 funds can be transferred to the DoD FHIF. AF/A4CFH identifies the funding transfer requirements and coordinates with SAF/FMB prior  to  submission  to  DUSD  Facilities,  Energy  and  Privatization  (I&E).  Following coordination with OMB, DUSD (I&E) forwards the transfer of funds request to the OSD Comptroller (C). OSD (C) notifies Congress of Air Force intent to transfer P-711 and/or P-713 funds to the DoD FHIF.     28 AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 2.12.4.  Funding Privatization Projects: 2.12.4.1.

Sustainable development concepts, to be incorporated into the planning, design, construction,  environmental  management  operation,  maintenance  and  disposal  of facilities and infrastructure projects, consistent with budget and mission requirements. A sustainable  facility  achieves  optimum  resource  efficiency  and  constructability  while minimizing  adverse  impacts  to  built  and  natural  environments  through  all  phases  of  its life cycle.   3.3.3.  Follow the guidelines in the Air Force Housing Support Facilities Guide to plan and design  Housing  Management  Offices,  housing  maintenance  facilities  and  storage warehouses.   32 AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 Chapter 4 DESIGN, MANAGEMENT AND PROJECT EXECUTION OF NEW AND REPLACEMENT, AND IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS  4.1.  Project Execution.  Each new and replacement construction and improvement project must comply with the HCP, develop whole-house and whole-neighborhood projects together, and for GOQs, must comply with the GOQ IFP. (T-1)    4.1.1.  Following  a  request  from  the  MAJCOM,  Director  of  Civil  Engineers,  Facilities, Environment  and  Energy  Division,  Facilities  Branch  (AF/A4CFC)  issues  a  design instruction,  allowing  the  architectural-engineering  (A-E)  design  phase  to  begin.  The  design phase ends when a construction contract is awarded (10 U.S.C. § 9540; 10 U.S.C. § 2855).   4.1.2.  The design manager is responsible for the following:   4.1.2.1.  Selecting  A-E  according  to  AFI  32-1023,  Design  and  Construction  Standards and Execution of Facility Construction Projects (Chapter 3).   4.1.2.2.

Use  HCP  design  concept  scope  to  develop  the  final  technical  design  of  the construction project or the RFP.   4.3.4.  The  Air  Force  is  required  by  10  U.S.C.  §  2807  to  notify  Congress  21  days  before obligation of funds for A-E design contracts over $1M. 10 U.S.C. § 9540(b) limits the A-E fee for producing plans and specifications for a FH project, to six percent of the PA.   4.4.  Programming, Design and Construction Execution Reporting: 4.4.1.  MAJCOMs  report  to  AF/A4CF  the  design  and  construction  status  of  FH  projects. Report status of programming, design and construction in a timely manner, using Automated Civil Engineer System-Project Management (ACES-PM).     4.4.2.  MAJCOMs  review,  validate  and  update  programming,  design  and  construction information.  Identify projects  under design, which exceed PA and/or decrease scope within PA, or revise rank and bedroom mix, to AF/A4CF for a review of programming options.     4.4.3.  AF/A4CF:   4.4.3.1.  Issues design instruction (DI) based on approved DD Form 1391 (PA/scope and rank and bedroom mix) and AFCEC request.   4.4.3.2.  Uses ACES-PM data to oversee the Air Force FH program.   4.4.3.3.  At the AFCEC request, issues authority to advertise (ATA) when project design is reported 100 percent in ACES-PM.   4.4.3.4.  Issues construction funds based on a validated bid report entered into ACES-PM by AFCEC.   4.5.  MILCON Design Authority: 4.5.1.  AF/A4CF:   4.5.1.1.  Delegates  three  percent  design  authority  to  AFCEC  for  A-E  selection, predefinition conference and preliminary A-E negotiations.   4.5.1.2.  Issues 35 percent  design instructions on FH projects  on delivery of the  BES  to OSD.   4.5.1.3.

Advanced  Authority  to  Advertise  (ATA)  FY-Plus-1-Year  Family  Housing  (FH) Projects.  AF/A4CF  generally  issues  ATA  FY  projects  after  AFCEC  confirm  projects  are  100 percent designed and ready to advertise and after passage of the FY DoD funding bills. However, 34 AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 AFCEC  may  realize  certain  benefits  from  advertising  projects  early.  AF/A4CF  will  issue advance  ATA  for  FY,  plus  1  year  for  FH  projects  before  all  congressional  committees  have marked the MILCON bill on the following conditions:   4.6.1.  The project must be 100 percent designed (as shown in ACES-PM) by 15 July of the year prior to appropriation.     4.6.2.  The project has a current working estimate less than or equal to the PA, given that the PA is subject to change with congressional reduction and foreign currency withholds.   4.6.3.  The project has successfully passed three congressional committee marks.     4.6.4.  The bid acceptance period is flexible for extensions until the MILCON bill is passed and funds are available for issuance.     4.7.  Design/Construction  Agent.  Under  U.S.C.  §  2851  and  DoDD  4270.5,  Military Construction, specific design/construction agents are designated based on geographical areas.   4.7.1.  For CONUS locations (including Alaska, Hawaii and Guam), the Air Force may use AFCEC as design/construction agent.   4.7.2.  For  overseas  (foreign)  locations,  the  Air  Force  may  only  use  the  Army  Corps  of Engineers or the Naval Facilities Engineering Commands as its design/construction agent for new and replacement construction projects. These agencies are responsible for the following geographical regions:   4.7.2.1.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers:  Europe  (excluding  Spain,  Portugal,  Italy,  Greece) United Kingdom, Japan, Korea and Turkey.   4.7.2.2.  Naval  Facilities  Engineering  Commands:  Greece,  Italy,  Portugal  (including  the Azores) and Spain.     AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 35 Chapter 5 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND PROJECT OVERSIGHT OF NEW AND REPLACEMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS  5.1.  MILCON  Project  Construction  Management.  Construction  agents  must  prepare  a comprehensive  management  plan  to  define  roles  and  responsibilities  for  participants  in  the construction  management  process.  (T-1)    Ensure  the  plan  provides  a  mechanism  for  resolving conflicts and serves as a tool for managing and controlling schedules.   5.2.  Cost Control.  AFCEC must:   5.2.1.  Avoid reprogramming projects, if at all possible.   5.2.2.  Submit  a  cost  control  management  plan  to  AF/A4CF  when  a  project  exceeds  120 percent of the PA. (T-1)  5.3.  Cost/Scope Variation and Reprogramming: 5.3.1.  AF/A4CF reprograms FH projects IAW 10 U.S.C. § 2853 when unforeseen conditions arise during construction causing cost increases.   5.3.2.  MAJCOM  Civil  Engineers  submit  a  written  justification  for  reprogramming  that includes:   5.3.2.1.  Current  working  estimates  based  on  valid  bids  or  proposals,  including  bid extensions.   5.3.2.2.  EA, if required, justifying an upward adjustment of High Unit Cost (HUC).   5.3.2.3.  Impact of terminating the contract.   5.3.2.4.  DD Form 1391, marked with changes.   5.3.2.5.  Justification for reprogramming.   5.3.3.  Use  the  following  procedures  for  approving  changes  to  FH  projects  including:  cost increases exceeding PA, scope reductions and scope increases:   5.3.3.1.  AF/A4CF  approves  cost  increases  less  than  20  percent  over  the  PA  or  $2M, whichever  is  less,  and  scope  reductions  of  less  than  20  percent.  Requests  for  AF/A4CF approval may come from AFCEC division chiefs or higher.   5.3.3.2.  AF/A4C  approves  cost  increases  over  the  PA  between  20  and  25  percent  or $2M, whichever is less and scope reductions from 20 to 25 percent. AFCEC submits all requests for AF/A4C approval.     5.3.3.3.  Congressional notification is necessary for all cost variations (increase/decrease) or scope reductions greater than 25 percent, or greater than $2M, whichever is less.   5.3.3.3.1.  SAF/IEE  must  approve  (before  notifying  Congress)  cost  variations  or scope reductions greater than 25 percent of the PA, or greater than $2M, whichever is less.     36 AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 5.3.3.3.2.  Requests  for  SAF/IEE  approval  and  congressional  notification  are submitted  by  AFCEC  and  sent  to  AF/A4CF.  AF/A4CF  processes  the  request  and forwards the request to SAF/IEE.   5.3.3.3.3.  A reduction of 25 percent or more from the scope of a project is considered scope  reduction  and  a  congressional  notification  is  necessary  before  enacting  the reduction. The congressional notification is independent of any request to reprogram funds that are excess to a project due to a scope reduction.   5.3.3.4.  AFCEC submits all requests for congressional approval.     5.3.3.5.  A  variation  of  25  percent  or  more  taken  from  the  PA  while  maintaining  the scope  of  a  project  is  considered  cost  variation  and  requires  congressional  notification. The  14-day  prior  notification  is  independent  of  any  request  to  reprogram  funds  that  are excess to a project due to a scope reduction.   5.3.4.  Include  the  following  in  requests  for  approval  of  changes  to  projects  including  cost  increases exceeding the PA and/or scope reductions:   5.3.4.1.  Current working estimates based on valid bid proposals.   5.3.4.2.  Thorough justification for the request, including an analysis of the cause for the change.   5.3.4.3.  Impact if not approved.   5.3.4.4.  Plan to prevent future occurrences (except scope increases).   5.3.5.  Use  the  following  procedures  for  changes  to  the  HUC  in  the  approved  budget submission:   5.3.5.1.  Improvement  Projects  Exceeding  Statutory  Improvement  Cost  Limit.  In compliance  with  10  U.S.C.  §  2825,  congressional  notification  is  made  by  the  budget submission  for the  statutory improvement cost limit.  improvement  projects  wherein the  HUC  exceeds 5.3.5.1.1.  During  project  execution,  obtain  AF/A4C  approval  if  the  unit  costs  are expected  to  exceed  by  up  to  25%  the  HUC  identified  on  the  DD  Form  1391  that  is included in the approved budget submission.  5.3.5.1.2.  During  project  execution,  SAF/IEE  and  AF/A4C  approval  is  necessary  if the unit costs are expected to exceed by 25% or more the HUC identified on the DD Form 1391 that is included in the approved budget submission.  5.3.5.2.  Improvement  Projects  Less  than  the  Statutory  Improvement  Cost  Limit.  The congressional  budget  submittal  only  includes  DD  Form  1391  for  projects  estimated  to exceed the statutory improvement cost limit. Therefore, if a DD Form 1391 with an HUC is not included, by default, the approved unit cost is less than the statutory improvement cost  limit.  If,  during  project  execution,  costs  are  projected  to  exceed  the  statutory improvement  cost  limit,  the  base  must  accomplish  the  statutory  requirement  to  notify Congress.  (T-0).    A  21-day  notice-and-wait  to  Congress  is  necessary  prior  to  executing the  improvements.  Once  congressional  notification  is  complete,  Paragraph    5.3.5.1 applies.      AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 37 5.3.5.3.  Requests  for  AF/A4C  or  SAF/IEE  approval  to  exceed  HUC  and  requests  for congressional  notification,  as  outlined  in  Paragraph  5.3.5.1  and    5.3.5.2,  respectively, are generated by AFCEC and require MAJCOM/CE coordination before being submitted to AF/A4CF.     5.3.5.4.  Utilities  and  Infrastructure  Inclusion.  The  high  unit  (most  expensive  unit)  cost should be calculated to include utilities and infrastructure that are the exclusive use of the unit. For example, include sewer lateral for sewer line, water branch for water line, patio, porch,  walkways,  privacy  fencing  and  driveway  in  the  cost  calculation  since  it exclusively services the housing unit.   5.3.6.  Costs associated with legally required environmental hazard remediation are excluded from  the  application  of  cost  variations/reprogramming  thresholds,  if  the  remediation  could not  have  been  reasonably  anticipated  at  the  time  the  project  was  approved  originally  by Congress.   5.4.  Substituting  Improvement  Projects  with  Replacement  Projects.  If  an  EA  shows  the authorized improvement project  is  no longer  cost-effective  after a  review of post-design or bid cost  estimate,  AFCEC  may  request  to  substitute  the  improvement  project  with  a  replacement project  at  the  improvement  project  programmed  amount.    SAF/IEE  approves  for  project substitutions.  5.5.  Scope  Verification  prior  to  Execution  of  Family  Housing  Construction  and Improvement    Projects  When  total  housing  requirements  are  modified  by  a  new  HRMA and  justify  a  change  to  the  previously  determined  scope  of  a  MFH  MILCON  project, written justification is necessary prior to award.  AFCEC coordinates with the MAJCOM and base to confirm whether the original scope is still valid, or if an adjustment in scope is necessary based  on  the  new  HRMA.    If  a  change  in  scope  is  warranted,  AFCEC  provides  AF/A4CF  and AF/A4CF with the recommended new scope and all supporting documentation for approval. 5.6.  Inspection Policy.  Each FH construction project delivery team must: 5.6.1.  Ensures a quality project is delivered on time and IAW the terms of the contract. 5.6.2.

Change of Occupancy Maintenance (COM)—Minor M&R work done on housing units when occupancy  changes.  Includes  interior  painting;  repairing  floors,  walls  and  ceiling  finishes;  and repairing  electrical  and  plumbing  fixtures.  Does  not  include  other  maintenance  or  repair  work, which may have been deferred until change of occupancy to avoid inconveniencing the residents.  Conversion—A  permanent  change  in  use  of  a  FH  facility  requiring  a  permanent  change  of category  code  on  real  property  inventory  records  from  a  FH  unit  to  a  non-FH  facility  category code. Diversion (previously known as temporary conversion)—Temporary change in the designated use  of  a  facility,  normally  not  to  exceed  3  years.  Diversion  requires  a  real  property  inventory record annotation of the applicable temporary facilities construction category code, but does not change category code on real property inventory records.  Dwelling  Units—A  single  structure  or  part  of  a  multi-family  building,  with  other  facilities directly  associated  with  the unit. Examples include carports,  garages, driveways, patios, walks, privacy fences, or other attached facilities and utility service lines (from the dwelling unit to the main utility line).  General  Officer  Quarters  (GOQ)—A  housing  unit,  including  grounds,  walks,  driveways  and other  paved  areas  and  structures  designated  for  the  exclusive  use  of  general  officers,  their families or guests.  Historic  Housing  Facilities—Facilities currently on, or eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places; or facilities that figure significantly in state or local history. Consult the  State  Historic  Preservation  Office  (SHPO)  and  other  interested  parties  on  undertakings involving historic housing as per the National Historic Preservation Act.  Housing Area—An identifiable grouping of FH facilities planned, developed and maintained in a residential character.  Housing  Community  Profile  (HCP)—A  long  range  planning  and  programming  document, consistent with land use as defined in the base comprehensive plan, which maps out development of  the  entire  housing  area  to  incorporate  whole-house  and  whole-neighborhood  concepts, including: • Developing elements of neighborhood vehicular and pedestrian circulation based on siting, density, landscaping, parking, playgrounds, recreation areas and utilities.   • Reconfiguring floor layouts, if necessary, to make housing more functional, livable and accessible.   • Extending the life of a unit for another 25 years by adding, expanding, or converting space.   • Housing unit as defined as a single structure or part of a multifamily buildings that include a carport, garage, driveway, or other associated parking, patio, privacy fence, utility service lines and other attached facilities.   Housing  Requirements  and  Market  Analysis  (HRMA)—A  formalized  method  used  to estimate  current  and  projected  housing  deficits  or  surpluses  at  any  given  installation. Professional  economists  trained  in  social  sciences  and  familiar  with  principal  data  sources  and analysis techniques conduct these analyses working as independent consultants. They justify the AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 45 need  for  the  Air  Force  to  acquire  or  construct  new  FH  units,  replace  existing  FH  units,  or undertake whole-house or whole-neighborhood improvement projects.  Major Maintenance and Repair (M&R)—Work necessary to fix or replace systems and their components nearing the end of their useful lives. Bases generally contract out for this work. The work includes:  • Restoring or replacing components of facilities damaged by fire, storm, or other disaster.   • Restoring or replacing equipment (over 1 horse power), utility systems, or plants.   • Restoring or replacing structural members in their original locations, foundations, roofs, exterior structures or walls, interior partitions, electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning and real property installed equipment.   • Any project where the cost of materials and labor exceed $2,500.   • Addition of insulation where either no insulation or inadequate insulation exists.   • Installation of carpet, vinyl wall coverings and wall paneling in existing facilities (when the flooring or walls require repair).   • Complete exterior painting, landscaping and planting of trees or shrubs.   • An upgrade to contemporary standards may be considered major M&R if (1) the work is consistent with projected facility life, utilization and sound engineering practices and (2) the upgrade would provide a better product and/or be more economical than the existing product. Perform an engineering analysis.   Minor  Alterations—Construction/Improvement  work  accomplished  with  P-722  funds.  Minor alterations work installs or constructs systems, features, or functional spaces that do not currently exist, replaces items still within their service life, or changes spaces that already exist (relocates walls,  adds  or  removes  openings,  or  otherwise  reconfigures  existing  spaces).  Projects  can  be interior  or  exterior  work  but  may  not  add,  expand,  or  extend  the  physical  dimensions  of  the house  or  increase  net  floor  area.  Replacement  of  failed  or  unserviceable  components  with contemporary  standard  components  or  materials,  consistent  with  local  GOQ  standards,  is  not minor alteration if justified by a life-cycle analysis considering planned and programmed work. Anti-Terrorism/Force  Protection requirements  supported  by  documented  vulnerability assessments are excluded from minor alteration cost limits.  Minor  Improvement—Improvement  project  (P-713)  where  the  per-unit  cost  does  not  exceed the  statutory  improvement  cost  limit  (see  Attachment  3).  In  calculating  the  statutory improvement  cost  limit,  include  the  total  cost  of  all  improvement,  major  M&R  and  minor alteration work planned or accomplished during the current FY.  Minor  Maintenance  and  Repair  (M&R)—Day-to-day  M&R  work  performed  in  response  to service calls or urgent job orders accomplished by contract or in-house forces.  Net Floor Area—Space within the interior faces of exterior walls and party walls of living units, with the exclusions as stated in Attachment 2.  Non-Dwelling  Units  (Ancillary  Support  Facilities)—Communal  facilities  directly  associated with  a  housing  area  or  facilities  outside  the  housing  area  that  solely  support  FH.  Examples include roads, common-use parking areas, bus shelters, playgrounds, common-use walks, utility mains and FH management offices and shops.  Programmed  Amount  (PA)—Total  project  cost,  including  construction,  contingencies, supervision, inspection and overhead.  46 AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 Project—All work necessary to produce a complete and usable facility, or a complete and usable improvement and M&R to an existing facility. Do not split the work to avoid limits, restrictions and thresholds.  Replacement Cost—Cost of replacing an existing FH unit built to its authorized size and whole-house  standards.  MAJCOMs  and  bases  estimate  the  unit  cost  together  with  the  cost  to  replace supporting facilities using the DoD Family Housing Cost Model. Calculate unit cost per net floor area according to the DoD pricing guide, multiply this by authorized net floor area and adjust the total by the ACF and project size factor. For supporting facilities, calculate the cost based on a specifically proposed site, using engineering cost estimates for:  • Site improvements.   • Streets.   • Utility Mains.   • Landscaping.   • Recreation.   • Any other features such as demolition or environmental hazard remediation.   Surplus  Housing—Housing that is no longer needed to support an installation FH requirement as determined by the HRMA.   AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015 47 FAMILY HOUSING (FH) UNIT PROGRAMMING SIZE STANDARDS  Attachment 2 Pay Grade Bedrooms Improvement Target Improvement Maximum Maximum Improvement Minimum Minimum Programming Benchmark New Construction  Garages Replacement/ New Construction Replacement/ New Construction Replacement/ NSF  NSM  GSF  GSM  NSF  NSM  GSF  GSM  NSF  NSM  GSF  GSM  NSF  NSM  GSF  GSM  Detached Units Attached Units 2 870 81 1,080  100 950 88 1,180  110 1,080  100 1,340  124 1,210  112 1,500  139   2 car 1-2 car 2/M 980 91 1,220  113 1,070  99 1,330  124 1,180  110 1,480  137 1,300  121 1,630  151   2 car 1-2 car 3 4 5  2 1,100  102 1,370  127 1,200  111 1,490  138 1,310  122 1,630  151 1,420  132 1,760  164   2 car 1-2 car 1,230  114 1,530  142 1,350  125 1,670  155 1,570  146 1,950  181 1,790  166 2,220  206   2 car 1-2 car 1,420  132 1,760  164 1,550  144 1,920  178 1,850  172 2,300  214 2,150  200 2,670  248   2 car 1-2 car                    870 81 1,080  100 950 88 1,180  110 1,200  111 1,490  138 1,440  134 1,790  166   2 car 1-2 car 2/M 1,050  98 1,300  121 1,150  107 1,420  132 1,350  125 1,670  155 1,540  143 1,920  178   2 car 1-2 car 3 4 5  3 4  4  4  4  4  4 1,230  114 1,530  142 1,350  125 1,670  155 1,500  139 1,860  173 1,650  153 2,050  190   2 car 1-2 car 1,330  124 1,650  153 1,450  135 1,800  167 1,730  161 2,150  200 2,020  188 2,500  232   2 car 1-2 car 1,420  132 1,760  164 1,550  144 1,920  178 2,020  188 2,510  233 2,490  231 3,090  287   2 car 1-2 car                    1,280  119 1,590  148 1,400  130 1,740  162 1,630  151 2,020  188 1,850  172 2,300  214   2 car 1-2 car 1,420  132 1,760  164 1,550  144 1,920  178 1,860  173 2,310  215 2,180  203 2,700  251   2 car 1-2 car                    1,490  138 1,850  172 1,620  150 2,010  187 1,940  180 2,410  224 2,180  203 2,700  251   2 car 1-2 car   1,560  145   1,930  179   1,700  158   2,110  196   2,030  189   2,520  234   2,350  218   2,920  271     2 car  1-2 car                    1,710  159 2,120  197 1,870  174 2,320  216 2,230  207 2,770  257 2,350  218 2,920  271   2 car 1-2 car                    1,920  178 2,380  221 2,100  195 2,600  242 2,690  250 3,330  309 3,270  304 4,060  377   2 car 1-2 car                    2,110  196 2,620  243 2,310  215 2,860  266 2,960  275 3,660  340 3,270  304 4,060  377   2 car 1-2 car Improvement Range  Replacement/New Construction Range    JENL (E1-E3)  JNCO (E4-E6)  SNCO (E7-E8)  CGO (O1-O3)  FGO (O4-O5)  E9/PRESTIGE  ISNCO (E9)  SO (O6)  IC SO (O6)  GO (O7+)  SCP GO (O7+)        48 AFI32-6002  20 NOVEMBER 2015  NOTE:  Detached homes are authorized two-car garages;
