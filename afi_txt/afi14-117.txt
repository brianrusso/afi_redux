TMP  Training  Program.  The  TMP  training  program  is  considered  Specialized  Training IAW  AFI  14-202,  Volume  1,  Intelligence  Training.    This  training  program  consists  of  three levels  (initial  training,  OJT,  and  PMT)  to  further  develop  an  individual’s  point  mensuration analytical  skills.    Successful  completion  of  initial  training  and  OJT  does  not  constitute certification. 3.2.  Air  Force  Precise  Point  Positioning  Program  (AFP4)  Training.  AFP4 training will be developed using the Instructional System Development process IAW AFPD 36-26, Total Force Development; AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional System Development; Air Force Handbook (AFH) 36-2235  Volume  1,  Information  For  Designers  of  Instructional  Systems  -  ISD  Executive Summary For Commanders And Managers, AFH 36-2235 Volume 2, Information for Designers of  Instructional  Systems,  AFH  36-2235  Volume  4,  Manager's  Guide  to  New  Education  and Training  Technologies,  AFH  36-2235  Volume  5,  Information  for  Designers  of  Instructional Systems Advanced Distributed Learning: Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, AFH 36-2235  Volume  6,  Informational  for  Designers  of  Instructional  Systems  Guide  to  Needs Assessment,  AFH  36-2235  Volume  9,  Information  for  Designers  of  Instructional  Systems Application  to  Technical  Training,  AFH  36-2235  Volume  10,  Information  for  Designers  of Instructional  Systems  Application  to  Education,  AFH  36-2235  Volume  12,  Information  for Designers of Instructional Systems Test and Measurement Handbook, and AFI 36-2201 (T-2). 3.3.  Initial  Training.  Initial training is the first required step toward AFP4 certification.  At a minimum,  training  will  cover  the  topics  established  by  NGA  as  Major  Graded  Areas,  Target Coordinate  Mensuration  Training  Program  defined  in  NGA  CONOPS  (T-1).    This  training exposes an individual to general target coordinate mensuration methods without regard to work center-specific mission or processes. 3.3.1.  Trainees will attend an initial training course held by the AFP4 Training Team at the 20th  Intelligence  Squadron  (T-2).    A  MTT  is  available  primarily  for  overseas  units.    MTT requests  must  be  submitted  by  the  MAJCOM  training  manager  to  AFP4  via  ACC/A2 designee (T-2). 3.3.2.  Initial training consists of a two-week course of instruction on various TCM methods followed by a final practical exercise and written exam (T-2). 3.3.3.  Personnel  are  required  to  successfully  complete  initial  training  at  least  once  in  their career.    If  a  significant  lapse  in  certification  occurs  and  the  work  center  POC  determines retraining is necessary, an individual may be required to repeat the initial training course (T-1). 3.4.  On  the  Job  Training  (OJT).  OJT  provides  the  repetition,  variety,  and  in-depth  training necessary  to  prepare  individuals  for  AFP4  certification.    OJT  is  typically  completed  at  an individual’s work center. 3.4.1.  All  students  must  successfully  complete  initial  training  prior  to  starting  the  OJT program (T-1). AFI14-117  15 DECEMBER 2016 23 3.4.2.  OJT  involves  completing  additional  training  datasets,  as  well  as  training  on  work center-specific procedures, tools, and processes (T-2). 3.4.3.  Individuals  must remain in  the certification training program  for at least  two months and  complete  all  training  requirements  prior  to  attempting  TMP  certification  (T-3).    If  the work  center’s  commander  deems  warranted  and  all  training  requirements  have  been completed,  early  certification  may  be  requested  by  having  the  commander  submit  a justification memorandum to the Director AFP4 for scheduling. 3.4.4.  To recertify, individuals do not  need to  re-accomplish  OJT.  However, repeating the OJT  training  is  recommended  if  there  is  a  major  difference  in  operational  software  or  the individual cannot demonstrate TMP proficiency. 3.5.  PMT.  Monthly PMT is required following certification and is designed to assist the analyst and work center in  maintaining analysts TCM  proficiency.  Datasets  and  validated answers are provided to all AFP4 Certified work centers on a monthly basis. 3.5.1.  Individuals  must  accurately  derive  coordinates  and  elevation  data  for  four  points,  in each certified method, and create one graphic on a monthly basis (T-2).  The work center will maintain copies of the target reports and graphics as documentation of PMT completion (T-3). 3.5.2.  Points dropped and graphics produced as part normal day-to-day duties may be used to satisfy the monthly PMT requirement.  This information will be tracked by the unit POC to ensure compliance with the intent of the monthly PMT program (T-2). 24 AFI14-117  15 DECEMBER 2016 Chapter 4 TARGET COORDINATE MENSURATION TMP CERTIFICATION PROGRAM 4.1.  AFP4  Certification  Team.  The  team  will  perform  all  individual  and  work  center certifications  for  TMP  (T-1).    Individual  certification  ensures  that  individuals  possess  a  high level  of  technical  skill  and  proficiency.    Work  center  certification  ensures  that  units  have  the necessary  tools,  procedures,  training  programs,  production  capability,  and  quality  control processes in place to assure mission accomplishment.  Only certified individuals will mensurate or  quality  control  the  coordinates  used  to  support  employment  of  coordinate-seeking  kinetic weapons  (T-1).    Only  TMP-certified  individuals,  using  a  certified  unit  process,  may  produce target  materials,  to  include:    mensurated  coordinates  used  for  planned/operational  targeting  or live-drop  training;  assign  JDPI  identifiers;  and/or  include  targeting  data  in  the  Modernized Integrated Data Base (MIDB) (T-1).  Additionally, the production or upload of associated JDPI Graphics  must  meet  established  joint  target  materials  standards  in  order  to  be  used  in  Joint Targeting Toolbox Electronic Target Folders or NGA's Target Management System (T-1). 4.2.  Individual TCM TMP Certification.  TMP-certified individuals will be proficient in work center  processes,  quality  review  processes,  and  fulfill  all  requirements  necessary  in  order  to maintain  certification  (T-1).    Only  certified  individuals  may  conduct  TCM  TMP.    This certification requirement cannot be waived.  While certification in all NGA-validated methods is ideal, at  a minimum, individuals must successfully demonstrate proficiency in the Direct Stand Alone/Digital  Point  Positioning  Database  (DPPDB)  Direct  method.    Refer  to  the  NGA Exploitation  Tool  Validation  Program  website  on  the  Secret  Internet  Protocol  Router  Network for  specific  information  regarding  validated  process  scenarios  and  imagery  requirements associated process:  http://www.geoint.nga.smil.mil/programs/validation/index.php (T-1). mensuration with each 4.2.1.  Certification Prerequisites.  Individuals must successfully complete initial training and OJT prior to certification (T-1). 4.2.2.  Certification.  TMP Certification consists of an “over-the-shoulder” evaluation, and a written or oral test that covers topics necessary for mission accomplishment.  If assigned to a work  center,  individuals  who  pursue  certification  will  also  be  evaluated  on  knowledge  of their work center’s local  procedures, as well as their ability to  perform  TMP processes that pertain  to  TCM.  (T-1).    At  the  conclusion  of  the  evaluation,  AFP4  will  determine  if individuals meet certification requirements or require further training and assessment (T-1).  At  AFP4  discretion,  individuals  who  do  not  demonstrate  acceptable  proficiency  on  a  task may be provided on-the-spot remedial training and immediate reevaluation or be required to reschedule  certification.    If  a  subsequent  individual  certification  visit  is  required,  a  waiting period of at least 60 days must be observed (T-1).  The following methods will be evaluated during TMP certification: 4.2.2.1.  Direct  Stand  Alone/DPPDB  Direct  derives  precise  and  accurate  coordinate  and elevation data directly from DPPDB (T-1). 4.2.2.2.  Registration  derives  precise  and  accurate  coordinate  and  elevation  data  via  the use of tie points to register a mono image with support data to stereo DPPDB (T-1). AFI14-117  15 DECEMBER 2016 25 4.2.2.3.  Multiple  Image  Geopositioning  derives  precise  and  accurate  coordinate  and elevation data by correlating multiple images without the use of DPPDB (T-1). 4.2.3.  Out-of-cycle certification.  In response to deployment tasks or special circumstances, work  centers  may  require  that  individuals  certify  or  recertify  outside  of  their  normal  cycle.  Out-of-cycle certification requirements will be submitted to the Director AFP4 and approved on a case-by-case basis to ensure that scheduling and funding are coordinated (T-2).  Out-of-cycle certifications are typically funded by the work center (T-2). 4.2.4.  PMT.    To  avoid  a  revocation  of  certification,  individuals  must  complete  monthly Precise  Point  Mensuration  (PPM)  PMT  (T-2).    Individuals  with  a  proficiency  gap  of  two months  but  less  than  12  months  will  be  restricted  from  performing  mensuration  duties  and must  be  evaluated  by  the  TMP  work  center  POC  to  determine  the  appropriate  course  of action  to  regain  proficiency  (T-2).    Individuals  with  a  proficiency  gap  of  more  than  twelve months must re-complete the certification process (T-2). 4.2.5.  Individual Certification Status.  TMP certification is valid for two years (T-2). 4.2.6.  Certification  Extensions.    TMP-certified  individuals  may  be  granted  a  certification extension  in  the  event  their  certification  expires  during  an  extended  absence  from  duty station  or  due  to  permanent  change  of  station.    Extensions  may  only  be  granted  for  the duration that would reasonably be required to make up the biennial certification and may not exceed one year.  Certification extensions are granted only if PMT is current.  Certification extensions  will  not  to  be  used  to  cover  lapses  in  work  center  execution  of  periodic certifications (T-2). 4.2.7.  Certification  is  not  required  for  individuals  who  perform  aimpoint  verification  or flying wing/unit-level  targeteers who derive points for training  and exercise purposes (does not  include  live  drops  on  range  targets).    Non-certified  individuals  may  also  verify coordinates  but  may  not  derive  mensurated  coordinates  for  use  in  the  employment  of coordinate-seeking weapons, contingency operations, or for inclusion in the MIDB. 4.2.8.  Pending  supervisor  approval  and  system  availability,  certified  individuals  at  non- certified  work  centers  may  maintain  certification  if  they  complete  the  required  proficiency maintenance.  Individuals contact the AFP4 Certification Team for further guidance. 4.3.  TMP Work Center Certification.  Work center certification is designed to promote work center  proficiency  through  adherence  to  approved  methods  and  the  application  of  established standards to ensure the accuracy of target coordinates. 4.3.1.  Requirements.    Organizations  requesting  a  TMP  work  center  certification  must  have documented processes in place that meet the standards set by NGA and the AFP4 (T-1). 4.3.2.  Certification  Process.    Organizations  requiring  initial  work  center  TMP  certification will coordinate with the AFP4 Certification Team to review work center PPM processes and training  tools  (T-2).    After  AFP4  review  and  approval,  organizations  will  request  AFP4 conduct  a  site  visit  in  order  to  validate  proper  program  employment  (T-2).    The  AFP4 Certification Team reviews work center programs and provides feedback.  TMP work center certification  will  only  be  granted  when  AFP4  is  satisfied  that  all  requirements  are  being fulfilled (T-2). 26 AFI14-117  15 DECEMBER 2016 4.3.3.  Work Center Recertification.  Work centers renew their certification when individuals assigned to the work center certify or recertify using that work center’s process.  The work center  certification  becomes  inactive,  if  no  individuals  certify  using  the  work  center’s processes for two years.  If a work center process changes significantly, the work center may be required to recertify (T-3). AFI14-117  15 DECEMBER 2016 27 Chapter 5 CDE QUALIFICATION PROGRAM 5.1.  CDE  Qualification  Program.  The  training  program  to  support  CDE  qualification  is considered specialized training IAW AFI 14-202, Volume 1, Intelligence Training.  This training program  consists  of  IQT  to  develop  an  individual’s  analytical  skills  in  the  Collateral  Damage Methodology.  To be qualified, a CDE analyst must complete the academic and practical portion of  a  JTS  accredited  qualification  program  and  pass  a  comprehensive  evaluation  that  meets  the requirements  of  CJCSI  3160.01B.    For  the  AF  CDE  qualification  program,  the  363  ISRG managed  CDE  IQT  meets  this  requirement.    Successful  completion  of  IQT  constitutes qualification  but  does  not  constitute  certification.    Once  qualification  is  completed,  it  does  not expire (T-1). 5.1.1.  CDE  IQT.  The  AF Collateral  Damage Estimation  Program  Manager (AF CDE/PM) will conduct an accredited CDE IQT course for designated CDE analysts (T-1).  The course will use academic and practical instruction based on JTS guidance and standards (T-1).  The AF CDE/PM will grant AF CDE qualification when analysts complete the required academic and practical portions of IQT and score 80% or better on both the CDM practical application and policy evaluations (T-1). 5.1.2.  CDE  IQT  MTT.    The  AF  CDE/PM  will  provide  an  MTT  with  CDE  IQT  capability that will travel to organizations with multiple analysts to be qualified (T-2).

Aimpoint  Verification—Act  of  visually  confirming  the  accuracy  of  an  assigned  joint  desired point  of  impact  (JDPI)  in  relation  to  the  actual  3-dimensional  geodetic  point  in  space  (e.g., reverse plot). Air  Tasking  Cycle—Air  tasking  cycle  provides  for  the  effective  and  efficient  employment  of joint air capabilities and forces.  This tool provides an iterative, cyclic process for the planning, apportionment,  allocation,  coordination,  and  tasking  of  tactical-level  weapons  and  capabilities within  the  overarching  strategy,  plans,  and  guidance  of  the  joint  force  commander.    The  tool 34 AFI14-117  15 DECEMBER 2016 focuses  joint  air  efforts  on  accomplishing  operational  requirements  and  develops  the  products needed to  build and execute the air tasking order and accomplish  assessment.  The cycle is  bi-directional,  iterative,  multi-dimensional,  sometimes  executed  in  parallel,  and  is  part  of  a  larger set of command and control processes.  It is built on a foundation laid by thorough intelligence preparation  of  the  battlespace  and  is  conducted  in  conjunction  with  the  joint  targeting  cycle.
