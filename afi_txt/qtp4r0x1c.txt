This QTP isdesigned to enhance 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level OJT of MRI personnel. This QTP isintended to be used by trainees, trainers, supervisors, and task certifiers.  Thispackage is available on computer disk, so you may reproduce copies as necessary;however, before initiating any training you should review your responsibilities--as asupervisor/trainer--for conducting on-the-job training (OJT) per AFI 36-2201,Developing, Managing, and Conducting Training.QTPs provide continuity to the trainee’s upgrade training.  The QTP moduleswere written to assist you in preparing for and conducting training. You must use theQTP modules for training when either: 1) the STS task is a core task (minimumqualification for the specialty); or 2) you have identified the STS task as arequirement of the trainee’s job.  Each module segments the major tasks intoteachable elements.  Your goal is to provide enough training and guidance so traineescan do all task related steps, without assistance, and produce a scan that meets localrequirements for speed and image quality.  QTPs also aid OJT task certifiers inevaluating the trainees demonstrated performance.  If you have local trainingrequirements not covered by a QTP module you should develop  “steps inperformance” and “performance checklists” that support and standardize those tasks.Accompanying this QTP is a qualification training progress record.This QTP record serves as a document to record the date trainee completes eachmodule.  All persons in qualification/upgrade training must have this QTP progressrecord filed in their OJT folder.  Use and annotation of this progress record is similarto current OJT documentation.  When you are satisfied the trainee meets standards, asprescribed in the QTP performance checklist, you must document and initial each taskcompletion date in column 2B of the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and the “datecompleted” column in the QTP progress record.  If a person is being recertified on atask that is supported by a QTP you must use that module to complete therecertification process.  It is not necessary to produce multiple hard copies of the QTPmodules; however, your workcenter requirements may require additional copies.Regardless, you should file the QTPs in an accessible location.Typically, you will manage each module by first training the tasks and then,evaluating performance.  Your local steps in performance may vary from the methodlisted in the QTP module.  If this is the case, you are authorized to make changes tothe first half of each module, (i.e. steps in task performance); however, the“performance checklist” is considered a standard and can not be altered.  You maytrain the QTP modules in any sequence; however, when conducting training use anorganized and methodical approach.  This will reduce your training time and enhanceyour efforts.When beginning any training process you should first, review the proceduresin each module with the trainee.  Second, direct the trainee to review the trainingreferences listed to prepare for task performance.  Third, go through the steps in taskIntroduction ______________________________________________ iiperformance with the trainee, allowing enough time to adequately train each step(some modules may take longer to teach). Forth, evaluate the trainees work at eachcritical step--using the performance checklist at this point will be helpful.  Fifth,evaluate the trainee’s performance and provide feedback on any areas forimprovement.  Finally, when the trainee has successfully completed the task you mustdocument and initial both the STS and the QTP progress record.  If the trainee doesnot accomplish the module, conduct follow-up instruction until the traineesuccessfully completes the task.The QTP project goal of the 381st Training Squadron, Sheppard AFB TX, isto publish a useable document for trainers and trainees. You are encouraged to sendin changes or revisions to the QTP.  A corrections/improvements letter is located onthe last page of this QTP.The inclusion of names of any specific commercial product, commodity, orservice in this publication is for informational purposes only and does not implyendorsement by the Air Force.Introduction ______________________________________________ iiiPageModule 1.
