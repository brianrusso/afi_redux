RAP is the CT program that defines the required mix of annual  sorties,  simulator  missions,  and  training  events  aircrew  shall  accomplish  to  sustain combat  mission  readiness  in  order  to  meet  DOC  tasked  requirements.    RAP  training requirements will be implemented via the MAJCOM published RTM.  (T-2). 1.7.1.  Basic Mission Capable (BMC).  A status that denotes a crewmember is receiving the minimum  training  required  to  be  familiar  with  all  missions,  but  only  required  to  be qualified/certified and proficient in some of the primary DOC mission requirements of their assigned or attached unit. 1.7.1.1.  The following aircrew will be designated as BMC:  (T-2). 1.7.1.1.1.  Active duty non-CMR aircrew member positions above the squadron level. 1.7.1.1.2.  Aircrew members who have a primary job performing wing supervision or staff functions that directly support flying operations. 1.7.1.1.3.  Aircrew  members  assigned  to  the  Formal  Training  Unit  (FTU),  United States Air Force Weapons School (USAFWS), and Operational / Developmental Test and Evaluation units. 1.7.1.2.  BMC  crewmembers  shall  be  able  to  attain  proficiency  and  if  required certification/qualification  in  30  days  or  less  for  those  missions/events  in  which  they maintain familiarization only. 1.7.1.3.  BMC aircrew will maintain all flight and ground currencies and accomplish all RAP designated training which affects BMC status.   Failure to  accomplish this  training results in regression to Non-BMC status (N-BMC).  (T-2). 1.7.1.4.  BMC  aircrew  members  may  deploy  and  participate  in  missions  that  they  are proficient and qualified in without additional training, as determined by the SQ/CC.   10  AFI11-2HH-60V1  8 APRIL 2015 1.7.2.  Combat  Mission  Ready  (CMR).  (T-2).    A  status  that  denotes  a  crewmember  is receiving  the  training  required  to  be  certified,  current  and  proficient  in  the  DOC  mission requirements of their assigned flying unit. 1.7.2.1.  The following aircrew will be designated as CMR:  (T-2). 1.7.2.1.1.  Combat  unit  active  duty  API-1/A  positions,  flying  squadron  commander (SQ/CC)  and  squadron  operations  officers  (SQ/DO).    If  a  unit  is  over-manned,  the SQ/CC  will  train  the  front  line  of  their  Unit  Manpower  Document  (UMD)  API-1/A positions to CMR and may elect to designate the overage as BMC.  (T-2). 1.7.2.1.2.  API-6/B  positions  not  assigned  to  the  flying  squadron  may  be  designated as  CMR  by  operations  group  commanders  (OG/CCs).    ANG/AFRC:    Any  aircrew member may be designated CMR/BMC at OG/CC discretion. 1.7.2.2.  CMR  aircrew  members  will  maintain  flight  and  ground  currencies  and accomplish  all  RAP  designated  training  that  affects  CMR  status.    Failure  to  complete training  or  maintain  currencies  will  result  in  regression  to  non-CMR  (N-CMR)  status.  (T-2). 1.8.  RAP  Policy  and  Management.  RAP  is  executed  IAW  this  instruction  and  the  current MAJCOM  RAP  Tasking  Memorandum.    The  RTM  takes  precedence  over  this  instruction  and may contain updated mission and event requirements not yet incorporated in this instruction. 1.8.1.  RAP Training Cycle.  The training cycle is defined by the RTM. 1.8.2.  RAP  Tasking  Memorandum.  The  RTM  identifies  BMC  and  CMR  training requirements  by  establishing  a  minimum  number  of  sorties,  events  and  special  capabilities that shall be completed based on aircrew experience levels.  Specific sorties and events listed in the RTM may not be identified in this volume and RTM guidance takes precedence. 1.8.2.1.  Sorties and events defined by the RTM are minimums and may not be reduced except  by  proration,  waiver  or  situations  as  stipulated  by  this  instruction  and  the  RTM.  (T-2). 1.8.2.2.  Each  RAP  sortie  will  accomplish  a  tactical  mission  scenario  or  a  basic  skills mission that supports the unit’s mission to receive credit as an effective RAP sortie.  (T-3). 1.8.2.3.  Units  will  follow  guidelines  for  RAP  sorties  and  events  with  minor  variances authorized.    SQ/CCs  may  use  variations  in  sortie  types  as  a  basis  for  end-of  cycle regression. in 1.8.3.  RAP Training Development.  Units will design a training program to achieve combat capability tasked  missions,  maintain  aircrew  proficiency  and  enhance  mission accomplishment  and  safety.    (T-1).    RAP  training  sorties  should  emphasize  either  over-arching  combat  skills  or  scenarios  that  reflect  procedures  and  operations  based  on employment  plans,  location,  current  intelligence,  and  opposition  capabilities.    Use  of procedures  and  actions  applicable  to  combat  scenarios  are  desired  (e.g.,  appropriate  use  of code  words,  authentication  procedures,  combat  tactics,  safe  recovery  procedures,  tactical deception,  in-flight  reports,  threat  reactions,  and  intelligence  briefing/debriefing).    Tactical training should include use of inert and live ordnance, threat simulators, countermeasures and dissimilar aircraft to the maximum extent possible. AFI11-2HH-60V1  8 APRIL 2015   11  1.8.4.

(T-3). 1.11.4.  API-6/8/B/D  flyers.    Units  should  provide  attached  API  6/8/B/D  flyers  adequate resources to maintain minimum training requirements.  However, API-6/8/B/D flyer support will not come at the expense of the flying squadron's primary mission.  If units cannot meet   12  AFI11-2HH-60V1  8 APRIL 2015 attached  flyer  requirements,  they  shall  request  relief  IAW  AFI  11-401,  as  supplemented.  Units  requiring  flying  hour  adjustments  for  attached  API-6/8/B/D  flyers  shall  request program changes IAW MAJCOM directives. 1.11.4.1.  For  FTU  only  wings,  API-6/B  crewmembers  will  maintain  instructor  status (optional  for  WG/GP  CC,  FCF  crewmembers).    These  wings  will  fly  API-1/6/A/B crewmembers as required by Program Flying Training (PFT).  (T-2). 1.11.4.2.  API-8/D (above wing level) rated personnel flying authorizations and Test Unit crewmembers will be IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM guidance.  They will fly the BMC rate; however, they are not required to complete BMC specific missions/events, or meet monthly RAP lookback requirements.  (T-2). 1.11.5.  CMR  crewmembers  have  no  maximum  sortie  requirement.    See  Table  1.2.  for minimum and maximum sortie requirements for other crewmembers.  Unique operations may require  crewmembers  to  fly  more  than  the  maximum  number  of  sorties  authorized.  Document details of these events in the member’s permanent training folder.

MQT  begins  at  the  FTU  and  provides  the  training necessary to initially qualify or re-qualify aircrew members to perform the unit mission.  Upon completion, aircrew members maintain Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. 3.1.1.  Method.    The  primary  method  of  completion  is  to  attend  the  appropriate  formal training course listed in the ETCA.  When attendance is not practical or no quotas exist, units may  request  a  waiver  to  conduct  in-unit  qualification  training.    Note:  Ensure  initial  NVG ground training is conducted IAW AFI 11-202V1. 3.1.2.  MQT Prerequisites.  Reference the current syllabus of instruction (SOI). 3.2.  Local  Mission  Qualification  Training.  LMQT  integrates  first  assignment  HH-60 crewmembers  into  their  first  operational  assignment  and  bridges  the  gap  between  MQT conducted  at  the  FTU  and  what  is  required  of  a  Combat  Mission  Ready  Airman.    LMQT  also provides those experienced crewmembers that PCS from another unit an introduction into daily flying operations and familiarization of the local flying area at the new unit. 3.2.1.  Method:  In-unit using MAJCOM approved Training Plans/SOI.  Approved Training Plans/SOI  are  posted  on  the  ACC/A3JT  Website  (https://acc.eim.acc.af.mil/org/A3/A3J-PR/A3JT/default.aspx).  An instructor will conduct all LMQT instruction in the respective crew position unless otherwise noted in the Training Plan/SOI.  (T-2). 3.2.2.  Prerequisites.  Qualified HH-60 crewmember. 3.2.3.  Restrictions:  Aircrew arriving from the FTU will not fly unsupervised until LMQT is complete.  (T-2).  Exception:  SQ/CCs may authorize limited flights provided members are current and specific LMQT training required for the sortie is complete. 3.2.3.1.  Aircrew  in  units  north  of  60  north  latitude  who  are  scheduled  to  complete LMQT during the summer months (April through September), have until 31 October to complete  the  required  night/NVG  training  events.    The  unit  commander  may  approve crewmembers that are not LMQT complete for night/NVG events as Mission Ready for local  area  flight  training  only.      Note:  Night/NVG  currency  will  be  gained  if  aircrew members are assigned TDY or deployed south of 60º North latitude.  (T-1). 3.2.3.2.  Complete LMQT no later than (NLT) 90 calendar days after the crewmember’s first  training  day  at  the  gaining  operational  unit  (ARC:  NLT  180  days  from  date  of  the first flight).  In unit training will begin no later than 45 days [90 days for the Air Reserve Component  (ARC)]  after  reporting  to  a  new  duty  station  or  unit.    First  Term  Airman Center (FTAC) training time does not count against the 90 day LMQT requirement.  (T-3). 3.2.4.  Aircrew  arriving  from  the  FTU  following  IQT/MQT  or  requalification  training  will maintain  BAQ  status  until  complete  with  MQT/LMQT  or  the  AETC  Instructor  Training Theater Indoctrination course and earn subsequent designation as CMR/BMC.   20  AFI11-2HH-60V1  8 APRIL 2015 3.2.5.  Personnel  that  PCS  as  a  CMR  or  BMC  aircrew  member  maintain  CMR/BMC  status upon  arrival  at  their  next  duty  station.    For  these  personnel,  LMQT  is  used  to  train  to  unit specific tasks but will not affect CMR/BMC status. 3.3.  TDY Aircrew Members.  Unit commanders will establish familiarization requirements for higher  headquarters  supervisory  personnel  and  Stan/Eval  personnel,  as  well  as  TDY  aircrew members  required to  conduct  specific  operational  missions  or  administer  training  or  evaluation flights.    (T-2).    These  crewmembers  will  familiarize  themselves  with  the  local  environment  to the maximum extent practical before their first flight. 3.4.  Mission  Certification.  The  Sq/CC  will  certify  crewmembers  as  BMC  or  CMR  upon completion of training requirements.  (T-2). 3.4.1.  Basic  Mission  Capable  Certification  (BMC).  Certification  as  BMC  requires  the following:  (T-2). 3.4.1.1.  Completion  of  all  BMC-related  ground  training  IAW  the  RTM.    Training missions may be flown before completing all items listed, provided grounding events are accomplished. 3.4.1.2.  Completion  of  all  BMC-related  flying  training  IAW  Tables  4.1,  4.2  and  the RTM.  SQ/CCs may allow crewmembers to fly unsupervised before all ground training is complete provided remaining ground training does not mandate supervision and will not affect mission accomplishment. 3.4.2.  Combat  Mission  Ready  (CMR)  Certification.  Certification  as  CMR  requires  the following:  (T-2). 3.4.2.1.  Completion of all CMR-related ground training IAW the RTM.  Individual will be current for all events which affect CMR status. 3.4.2.2.  Completion  of  all  CMR-related  flying  training  IAW  Tables  4.1,  4.2  and  the RTM.  Individual will be current for all events which affect CMR status. 3.4.2.3.  Qualification  and/or  certification  in  any  specialized  training  required  for  CMR status. 3.4.2.4.  Meet 1-month lookback at the CMR sortie rate. AFI11-2HH-60V1  8 APRIL 2015   21  Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  General.  This  chapter  combined  with  the  MAJCOM  RAP  Tasking  Memorandum  defines minimum ground and flying training requirements for BAQ, BMC and CMR crewmembers.  CT provides  aircrew  the  training  necessary  to  maintain  flying  proficiency  and  consists  of  two aspects.    The  first  involves  training  in  the  basic  flying  skills  necessary  to  ensure  the  safe operation  of  the  aircraft  (Non  RAP).    The  second  consists  of  specific  mission-related  training required to be proficient in the unit's assigned missions (RAP). 4.2.  Ground  Training.  Ground  training  will  be  accomplished  IAW  the  RAP  Tasking Memorandum, ancillary training requirements, and this AFI.  (T-2).  The RTM establishes event frequency, identifies grounding events, and reflects if mission status is affected. 4.2.1.  Units  may  credit  ground  training  accomplished  during  IQT/MQT/LMQT  toward  CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished.  Note:  Unit commanders will  determine  mobility  ground  training  requirements  for  aircrew  members  assigned  to Training and Test coded units or API-8/D positions.  (T-2). 4.2.2.  Event descriptions and amplifying guidance is listed in Attachment 2 of this AFI. 4.3.  Flying  Training.  Aircrew will accomplish flying training requirements applicable to their individual crew  position  IAW  Table  4.1,  Table  4.2,  and  as  specified  by  the  RTM.    BAQ-only aircrew  will  maintain  currency  in  applicable  events  noted  as  BAQ  in  flying  training  tables.  Failure  to  accomplish  flying  requirements  may  affect  BMC/CMR  status  and  require  additional training.  (T-2). 4.3.1.  Crewmembers  assigned/attached  to  Training  or  Test-coded  units  will  accomplish the BMC  requirements  as  shown  in  the  RTM  for  those  events  that  they  are  qualified/certified.  Failure to accomplish requirements will not affect instructor status, but will require training as  determined  by  the  SQ/CC.    Additionally,  the  SQ/CC  will  determine  which  requirements listed in Table 4.1 and Table 4.2 will be maintained by assigned/attached aircrew members.  (T-2). 4.3.2.  Event  descriptions,  requirements,  and  amplifying  guidance  are  listed  in  Attachment 3. Table 4.1.  Pilot Currencies (T-1).

Loss  of  currency  exceeding  6  months  but  less  than  36  months  for  instructor certified events results in loss of certification.  Crewmembers will accomplish training as directed by the SQ/CC and re-certification by an instructor.  (T-1). 4.6.2.4.  Loss  of  currency  exceeding  36  months  for  instructor  certified  events  results  in loss of certification.  Crewmembers will accomplish training as outlined in the Training Plan/SOI followed by recertification.  (T-1). 4.6.3.  Currency  for  Training  North  of    60°  North  Latitude.  Aircrew members assigned to units north of the 60° parallel will handle night/NVG currency as follows:  (T-1). 4.6.3.1.  Only  day  sortie/event  currencies  from  1  April  to  30  September  need  to  be maintained.  Consider all experienced crew members current for night sorties/ events on 1 October providing day currencies have been maintained.  Inexperienced aircrew members will regain night currency by demonstrating proficiency in delinquent sorties/events to an instructor. 4.6.3.2.  NVG  currency  does  not  need  to  be  maintained  from  1  April  through  30 September, however to remain BMC/CMR, currency will be regained by 31 October.  To regain  currency,  the  most  appropriate  instructors,  as  selected  by  the  SQ/CC  will  fly  an NVG  route.    Other  non-current  crew  members  will  regain  currency  by  demonstrating proficiency to an instructor. 4.6.4.  Requalification Training.

Aircrew may be regressed to N-BMC or N-CMR for one or more  of  the  reasons  listed  in  the  following  paragraphs.    Exception:    HQ  AETC  determines regression policy and guidance for FTU aircrew. 4.7.1.  While N-BMC/N-CMR, the SQ/CC will determine missions aircrew may perform and supervision required.  (T-1). 4.7.2.  Units  will  track  regression  of  all  aircrew  using  the  unit  certification  document  or approved unit developed product.  (T-2). 4.7.3.  Regression  for  loss  of  currency.  Currency  status  for  the  purpose  of  tracking  and reporting regression will be determined by units on the first duty day of each month. 4.7.3.1.  Aircrew delinquent for a ground training event affecting BMC/CMR status will be  regressed  to  N-BMC/N-CMR.    Crewmembers  will  accomplish  the  required  ground training IAW governing directives prior to recertification.  (T-1). 4.7.3.2.  Loss  of  Flying  Training  Currency.    Loss  of  currency  in  a  flight  training sortie/event  affecting  BMC/CMR  status  will  result  in  regression  to  N-BMC/N-CMR.  Crewmembers  will  regain  currency  in  the  delinquent  sortie/event  prior  to  being recertified as CMR.  (T-1).  Note: N-BMC/N-CMR crewmembers may fly unsupervised on CONUS and OCONUS missions if delinquent events are not flown, are not required for mission accomplishment, and do not result in loss in aircraft currency or qualification.  OG/CC approval is required for other than local, routine or non-contingency missions. 4.7.4.  Regression  for  Failure  to  Meet  RAP  Lookback.    1-month  and  3-month  RAP lookback sortie requirements (rates) will be defined in the RTM.  Both 1-month and 3-month sortie lookback totals  will  be calculated on the first duty  day of each  month for both  BMC and CMR aircrew.  Only designated RAP sorties and contingency operations sorties may be used to determine lookback.  (T-1). 4.7.4.1.  Lookback  computations  for  new  aircrew  members  begin  following  completion of LMQT.  New aircrew members who have been mission certified for less than 3 months will  meet  1-month  lookback  to  maintain  status  until  a  3-month  lookback  is  established.  (T-2).  SQ/CCs may apply probation rules if a new aircrew member fails to meet 1-month lookback while establishing 3-month lookback. 4.7.5.  Failure  to  Meet  1-Month  and/or  3-Month  Lookback.  If  a  BMC/CMR  aircrew member does not meet 1-month RAP lookback requirements, a review will be made of their 3-month RAP lookback requirements.  If the 3-month lookback has been met, aircrew may, at SQ/CC discretion, remain in BMC/CMR status.  If an aircrew member fails to meet the 3-month lookback requirement, SQ/CCs may either place the crewmember in probation status for one month or regress the crewmember to N-CMR/N-BMC.  (T-1). 4.7.6.  Probation.    If  SQ/CC  chooses  probation,  the  aircrew  member  will  reestablish  a  1-month lookback at the end of the probation period to remain BMC/CMR.  Failure to establish a 1-month lookback at the end of the probation period will result in regression to N-BMC/N-CMR.  (T-1). 4.7.7.  CMR/BMC  crewmembers  regressed  to  N-CMR/N-BMC  will  complete  a  SQ/CC-approved recertification program.  Upon completion of the program, crewmembers will meet 1-month lookback prior to recertification as CMR/BMC.  Missions and events accomplished AFI11-2HH-60V1  8 APRIL 2015   27  the  recertification  program  apply during requirements.  (T-1). toward  monthly  and training-cycle  RAP 4.7.8.  For aircrew members who do not meet lookback requirements throughout the training cycle, the SQ/CC may elect to initiate the following actions: 4.7.8.1.  Remove the aircrew member from active flying status. 4.7.8.2.  Remove the aircrew member from a CMR manning position. 4.7.8.3.  Place aircrew member in a commander directed training program to regain CMR status. Figure 4.1.  RAP Lookback Flow. 4.7.9.  Regression  for  failure  of  a  Periodic  Evaluation.  Aircrew  members  who  fail  a periodic evaluation will regress to N-CMR or N-BMC, as applicable.  BMC or CMR will be regained  upon  successful  re-accomplishment  of  evaluation  unless  additional  training  is deemed appropriate by the SQ/CC or SQ/DO.  (T-1). 4.8.  End-of-Cycle  Requirements.  Aircrew  who  fail  to  complete  RTM-defined,  end-of-cycle sortie  and/or  event  requirements  may  require  additional  training  depending  on  the  type  and    28  AFI11-2HH-60V1  8 APRIL 2015 magnitude of the deficiency.  In all cases, report training shortfalls IAW RTM guidance.  End-of-Cycle training requirements are based on the aircrew members experience level on the last day of the current training cycle.  (T-2). 4.8.1.  Failure to Meet End-of-Cycle Total RAP Sortie Requirements.  Aircrew failing to meet end-of-cycle total RAP sortie requirements may continue at CMR/BMC if both 1- and 3 month RAP lookback requirements are met and sortie deficiencies are deemed insignificant by the SQ/CC.  If the SQ/CC determines the sortie deficiency is significant or lookback is not met,  the  crew  member  will  regress  to  N-CMR/N-BMC.    To  regain  CMR/BMC  status, aircrew will complete a SQ/CC approved recertification program.  (T-1). 4.8.2.  Failure  to  Meet  End-of-Cycle  RAP  Event  Requirements.  Aircrew failing to meet end-of-cycle RAP event requirements will regress to N-BMC/N-CMR.  Prior to CMR/BMC recertification,  aircrew  will  complete  all  deficient  events  and  any  additional  training  as determined  by  the  SQ/CC  and/or  DO.    (T-1).    Remedial  events  may  count  towards  total requirements for the new training cycle. 4.8.3.  Failure  to  Meet  End-of-Cycle  Special  Capabilities/Qualifications.    SQ/CC  will determine if shortfalls warrant loss of Special Capability certification and regression to Non-CMR/Non-BMC.  (T-1). 4.9.  Proration  of  End-of-Cycle  Training  Requirements.  At the end of the training cycle the SQ/CC  may  prorate  training  requirements  for  crewmembers  when  Duty  Not  Including  Flight (DNIF), emergency leave, “non- flying” TDYs/exercises/deployments (ANG, AFRC: mandatory training  required  for  civilian  employment)  preclude  training  for  a  portion  of  the  training  cycle.  Ordinary  leave  will  not  be  considered  as  non-availability.    Extended  bad  weather  or  other environmental factors that preclude the unit from flying for more than 15 consecutive days may be  considered  as  non-availability.    Commanders  will  not  prorate  for  time  deployed  for contingency operations unless the individual(s) were assigned to non-flying positions.  (T-2). 4.9.1.  Proration  will  only  be  used  to  adjust  for  genuine  circumstances  of  training  non-availability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies.  (T-1). 4.9.2.  Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying during the training cycle.    Add  separate  cumulative  non-availability  events  together  for  the  total  approved proration.    Use  Table  4.3  to  determine  the  number  of  months  to  be  prorated  based  on cumulative calendar days of non-availability. 4.9.3.

These  training requirements are performed on an irregular basis as needed or desired. 5.8.1.  Pre-Deployment  Spin-up  Training.  Training  conducted  prior  to  deployments  or contingency operations (if time permits) designed to ensure crewmembers have the ability to conduct missions in support of the expected tasking.  Units are responsible for contacting the appropriate command or agency to determine expected mission requirements (e.g. 561 JTS, Unit  Prep  Message,  DOC  statement,  C-NAF  priorities,  etc.).    Training  will  be  tailored  to meet  tasking  requirements  and  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  tasks/procedures/equipment  not accomplished  or  utilized  during  daily  operations.    (T-2).    When  training  is  required  for  a system  not  available  to  crewmembers,  the  unit  commander  will  use  all  available  resources (e.g.,  Formal  Training  Unit  courseware,  Computer  Based  Training,  etc.)  to  accomplish required training.  Consideration should be given to a “bundled” academic and flying training program  incorporating  refresher  weapons  and  tactics  training,  aircrew  intelligence  training, verification planning exercise, and a CSAR. 5.8.1.1.  Training  Plan/SOIs  will  be  designed  by  the  unit  and  approved  by  the  SQ/CC.  Units  will  develop  a  process  to  document  individual  training  completion  prior  to AFI11-2HH-60V1  8 APRIL 2015   39  deployment/contingency operations.  OG/CCs will ensure participating aircrew are ready to deploy and are able to conduct all missions in support of expected tasks.  (T-3). 5.8.1.2.  If  a  crewmember  is  not  assigned  to  the  supported  squadron,  they  shall  receive spin-up training as determined by the SQ/CC.  The deploying SQ/CC will determine the amount of spin-up training required for each attached/augmenting member based on the level of proficiency, currency, qualification and experience.  The augmentee's SQ/CC is responsible  for  ensuring  the  spin-up  training  is  accomplished  prior  to  the  member’s deployment.  (T-3). 5.8.1.3.  Ground  Training.    Accomplish  ground  training  IAW  Attachment  2  of  this Instruction and Ground Training Requirements Table located in the current RAP Tasking memo.    Units  may  credit  ground  training  accomplished  during  IQT/MQT  toward  CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished. 5.8.1.4.  Flying Training.  Training will be tailored to ensure deploying crewmembers are current,  qualified,  and  proficient  in  expected  mission  taskings.    Special  consideration should  be  given  to  actual  CSAR  employment.    This  will  provide  the  opportunity  to practice/simulate flying,  and debriefing a  mission  within  a  specific  AOR.    This  mission  should  be  executed  utilizing current planning, briefing, and employment procedures within the AOR. requirements/procedures  associated  with  planning,   40  AFI11-2HH-60V1  8 APRIL 2015 Chapter 6 AIRCREW TRAINING RECORDS 6.1.  General.  This chapter specifies procedures for the management of aircrew training records and the documentation of in-unit training.  Documentation of training conducted at the FTU will be IAW AETC guidance.  Units executing AETC syllabus via SMT will utilize forms directed by the syllabus.  (T-2).  Note:  MAJCOMS may direct the use of different training documentation systems  (e.g.  GTIMS  or  other  electronic  programs),  forms  and  standards.    In  this  case,  the guidance  in  this  chapter  does  not  imply  the  need  for  duplicate  training  documentation  and MAJCOM-specific guidance takes precedence. 6.2.  Career  Training  Folder.  Units will maintain a career training folder for all assigned and attached  crewmembers.
