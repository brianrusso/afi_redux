As  stated  in  the  National  Security  Space  Strategy,  space  is  becoming increasingly “congested, contested, and competitive.”  A leaner, more agile Air Force operating in  and  through  a  highly  dynamic,  dependently  integrated  and  increasingly  contentious  space environment  demands  a  well-trained,  technically  proficient,  deliberately  developed  and purposefully utilized cadre of enlisted professionals in space systems operations. 1.2.  Policy  Linkages.  Figure  1.1.  Governance  for  Enlisted  Personnel  in  Space  Systems Operations,  illustrates  the  linkages  from  which  this  Air  Force  Instruction  is  derived  and supported. Figure 1.1.  Governance for Enlisted Personnel in Space Systems Operations.  1.3.  Enlisted Personnel in Space Systems Operations. 1.3.1.  Enlisted  personnel  perform  space  systems  operations  in  the  space  domain;  a  core operating  domain  of  the  Air  Force.    The  space  domain  is  a  direct  contributor  to  air,  land, maritime  and  cyberspace  operations.    Space  operations  are  conducted  in  all  domains  with terrestrial  and  sea-based  platforms,  aboard  space  lift  vehicles,  via  persistent  on-orbit constellations, and across the electromagnetic spectrum. 1.3.2.  Enlisted  personnel  in  space  systems  operations  deliver  space-related  effects  and capabilities  to  recipients  ranging  from  National  Command,  Control,  Communications  and Intelligence  (NC3I)  enablers  to  in-theater  warfighters  exploiting  protected  communications to commercial consumers of global navigation and timing products. AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 7 1.3.3.  Due to the technical nature of space operations, the broadening diversity of threats and the  complexity  of  the  future  battlespace,  the  development  of  space  systems  operations personnel  must  instill  a  culture  of  anticipation,  adaptation  and  agility.    This  is  essential  to maintaining  superiority  in  the  space  domain  and  supports  fighting  through  conflict  rather than conceding any capability. 1.3.4.  Enlisted  personnel  in  space  systems  operations  support  an  unprecedented  global reliance  on  available,  dependable  and  transparent  space  capabilities,  and  warfighter requirements to provide and sustain an integrated space situational awareness picture. 1.3.5.  The  space  domain  is  flattening.    The  vertical  environment  is  increasingly  saturated with “near space peers.”  Challenges to our ability to operate freely through space, recognize when  fighting  extends  to  space,  exploit  space-based  effects  at  a  time  and  tempo  of  our choosing  and  dictate  the  parameters  of  space  access  require  a  high  degree  of  technical expertise and application.     1.3.6.  The space domain is evolving.  With aging command and control and space systems being  refreshed  or  replaced  at  a  high  rate,  and  technical  advancements  and  innovations  in automation,  the  ability  to  keep  pace  with  the  quantum  evolution  of  space  operations  has fundamentally changed how we assess, educate, develop and employ space professionals. 1.3.7.  Today’s  1C6X1  specialty  must  present  forward  a  professional,  experienced, innovative and ready operational cadre that is:  1.3.7.1.  A  total  force,  deliberately  developed  and  efficiently  utilized  to  deliver  distinct, specific and expected capabilities;  1.3.7.2.  Purposefully  cultivated  to  articulate,  integrate,  decisively  direct  and  execute space tactics, techniques, and procedures;  1.3.7.3.  Positioned to most effectively employ and exploit the full range and spectrum of space systems operations;  1.3.7.4.  Postured and prepared to extend commander options with space-based solutions during peacetime, contingency and war and; 1.3.7.5.  Organized  and  equipped  to  sustain  our  nation’s  ability  to  rapidly  engage  and respond  to  existing,  emerging,  maturing  and  dynamically  evolving  opportunities  and threat environments in the space domain.   1.3.8.  Our  ability  to  provide  dominant  space  operations  is  underwritten  by  our  ability  to develop  1C6X1  personnel  along  an  anticipatable  career  path  concentrated  on  producing strong analytical  skills,  a high state of readiness,  relevant  experience, and a combination of space  enterprise  and  Air  Force  institutional  perspective.    Figure  1.2.  Career  Pyramid  for Enlisted  Personnel  in  Space  Systems  Operations  depicts  the  components  of  the  specialty’s development path.  8 AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 Figure 1.2.  Career Pyramid for Enlisted Personnel in Space Systems Operations.  AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 9 Chapter 2 1C6X1 CORE CAPABILITIES 2.1.  Primary 1C6X1 Mission Areas.  Our national security space capabilities are dependent on our  ability  to  access  and  operate  freely  in  or  through  space  at  the  time  of  our  choosing  while denying the adversary the same.  Space systems operations are diverse and dynamic.  Annex 3-14, Space Operations, prescribes four overarching space mission areas: Space Operations, Space Control,  Space  Support,  and  Space  Situational  Awareness  (SSA).    In  comparison,  national policy,  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  policy,  and  joint  doctrine  identify  four  mission  areas: space  force  enhancement;  space  support;  space  control;  and  space  force  application.    In  both cases,  all  mission  areas  are  underpinned  by  SSA.    NOTE:  Annex  3-14,  Space  Operations, divides  SSA  operations  into  the  following  three  components:  Intelligence,  Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR); Space Environmental Monitoring; and C2. 2.2.  Related  1C6X1  Mission  Areas.  Space  systems  operations  include  joint,  integrated  and interdependent capabilities that produce synergistic effects for the warfighter. 2.2.1.  Integrated  Air  and  Missile  Defense.    Missile  defense  operations  are  conducted  to attain  and  maintain  a  desired  degree  of  superiority  by  the  destruction  or  neutralization  of enemy  air  and  missile  forces.    Space  systems  operations  provides  the  sensor  data  to  the shooter capability. 2.2.2.  ISR.   ISR operations conduct strategic intelligence collection and provide multi- and all-source  intelligence  in  highly  contested,  communications-degraded  environments  across all domains.  Intelligence integration provides awareness of the operational environment for tactical, operational, and strategic commanders and decision makers. 2.2.3.  Integrated  Operations.    Integrated  operations  provide  focal  points,  reach-back capabilities  and  centers  of  excellence  for  the  employment  of  worldwide  joint  space  forces.  They enable space power integration into the range of military operations and provide direct support to air, space and cyberspace war-gaming.  Operations include but are not limited to C2  centers,  space  ranges,  space  aggressors,  Air  Operations  Centers  (AOC),  cyberspace operations, and national programs. 2.2.4.  Space  Test  and  Evaluation.    Space  Test  and  Evaluation  efforts  validate  and  enhance warfighter capabilities through testing and evaluation of space systems.  Airmen performing these  duties  are  responsible  for  planning,  executing  and  reporting  all  Force  Development Evaluation, tactics and concepts testing, and command-directed testing of space assets. 2.2.5.  Special Staff Positions.  Special staff positions exist at the group, wing, Numbered Air Force  (NAF),  Major  Command  (MAJCOM),  and  Air  Staff  levels.    These  unique  positions perform  various  functions  that  support  space  operations,  establish  policy,  and  provide guidance to space forces. 2.2.6.  Operations Support Functions.   1C6X1 personnel  also  serve in a variety of auxiliary duties  that  are  critical  to  operational  effectiveness,  mission  sustainment,  and  force management.    Support  functions  include  but  are  not  limited  to:    Space  Education  and Training;  Intelligence;  Plans  and  Programs;  Orbital  Analysis;  Quality  Assurance; Standardization  and  Evaluation;  Systems  Acquisition;  Systems  Engineering;  Systems 10 AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 Integration;  Systems  Test  and  Evaluation;  and  Weapons  and  Tactics.    Expertise  in  the associated primary mission area is prerequisite to many operations support functions. AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 11 Chapter 3 FUNCTIONAL ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE 1C6X1 AIR FORCE SPECIALTY 3.1.

Types of Work for Enlisted Personnel in Space Systems Operations.  Enlisted personnel in  space  operations  perform  highly  specialized  duties  covering  all  aspects  of  space  operations and  levels  of  war  (tactical,  operational,  and  strategic).    They  progress  through  the  following functional  roles  based  on  their  cumulative  training,  education,  experience  and  professional development:  4.1.1.  Tactical Operator.  Primarily focused on operating or supporting operation of a space weapon system  in  direct  support to  a tactical  mission.   The tactical  operator is  the broadest function  category  and  comprises  opportunities  for  personnel  in  the  specialty  to  obtain mission breadth and technical depth.   4.1.2.  Operational Integrator.  Subject matter expert in one or multiple mission areas that is focused  on:  developing  and  exercising  tactics,  techniques  and  procedures;  integrating  air, space  and  cyberspace  capabilities;  and  delivering  capabilities  and  effects  across  the  space enterprise.   4.1.3.  Strategic  Manager.    Enterprise  expert  in  all  facets  of  space  acquisitions,  operations, service and joint operations integration, and mission management. 4.1.4.  Senior  Leader.

Space  Systems  Operations  Tacticians  and  Technicians.  The  terms  “Tactician”  and “Technician”  delineate  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  commissioned  officers  in  the  Space Operations (13SX) and 1C6X1 specialties.  Both tacticians and technicians attend paralleling Air Force specialty awarding courses, are trained to a similar initial mission ready status, and often serve in comparable operational roles in order to gain a working knowledge of space operations and an initial exposure to crew operations.  This is necessary to give all space operators a solid operational foundation.  In order to most effectively and efficiently utilize the space operations cadre, distinguishable roles, responsibilities, professional development, and desired end states of tacticians and technicians are delineated to place each onto appropriate and relevant career paths.  Although  officer  and  enlisted  space  professionals  often  work  in  tandem,  tacticians  exploit  and technicians  employ  space  capabilities  through  separation  of  mission  roles  and  scopes  of leadership  responsibilities.    Figure  5.1.  (Space  Tacticians  and  Technicians)  shows  the competencies and relationships between 13SX (tacticians) and 1C6X1 (technicians).   Figure 5.1.  Space Tacticians and Technicians 5.2.  Duty Titles for Enlisted Personnel  in Space Systems  Operations.  To comply with AFI 36-2618, Enlisted Force Structure, Chapter 7, the following are the only authorized duty titles for the 1C6X1 career field.  When properly applied, duty titles facilitate a quick understanding of  AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 15 a  person’s  role  and  level  of  responsibility.    Standardized  duty  titles  support  purposeful  and deliberate  development  of  space  systems  operations  Airmen,  and  are  required  to  meet  the CSAF’s  vision  of  mentoring  via  Enlisted  Developmental  Teams.    Enlisted  duty  titles  will  be assigned based upon scope of responsibility and the preponderance of duties being performed.  A consistent,  standard  approach  is  important  to  ensure  the  terms  are  meaningful.    Higher  fidelity delineation  within  duties,  specific  missions,  systems,  roles  and  responsibilities  will  be distinguished through tailorable unit-derived duty descriptions, with unique experiences codified via Special Experience Identifiers (SEI).  Deviations from or alterations made to authorized duty titles  will  prevent  experiences  from  being  accurately  represented  in  Air  Force  professional development tools and databases.  The authority to waive adherence to authorized duty titles for the 1C6X1 specialty is AF/A3ST.  Figure 5.2. (Authorized Duty Titles for Enlisted Personnel in Space Systems Operations) depicts appropriate duty titles for each grade. Figure 5.2.  Authorized Duty Titles for Enlisted Personnel in Space Systems Operations. 5.2.1.  Operator.  Use for a space systems operations apprentice, student, trainee or helper.  It applies to non-prior service personnel in 3-level upgrade training prior to becoming mission ready.  For manning documents and performance reports, use the term “Operator.”  16 AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 5.2.2.  Technician.    The  enlisted  space  technician  is  the  backbone  of  the  space  enterprise.  Use for a mission ready  journeyman or specialist in the grades of airman basic to technical sergeant and personnel in 5-level upgrade that have been certified mission ready on a space weapon  system.    Career  Airmen  in  the  ranks  of  senior  airman  to  technical  sergeant  who retrain into and are awarded the space systems operations specialty, may be given the title of “technician”  while  in  5-level  upgrade  once  they  complete  all  required  on-the-job  training (OJT) or are certified mission ready in order to assume and reflect duties and responsibilities in  line  with  their  peers.    For  manning  documents  and  performance  reports,  use  the  term “Technician.” 5.2.3.  Supervisor.  Use for a mission ready craftsman or lead in the ranks of staff sergeant to technical  sergeant.    It  is  also  used  for  some  junior  enlisted  Airmen  and  Noncommissioned Officers (NCO) who are first line supervisors. Junior enlisted Airmen will not have the duty title  "Supervisor"  unless  they  are  at  least  a  senior  airman,  an  Airman  Leadership  School (ALS)  graduate,  and  supervise  the  work  of  others.    Career  Airmen  in  the  ranks  of  staff sergeant to technical sergeant who retrain into and are awarded the space systems operations specialty, may be given the title of “supervisor” while in 5-level upgrade once they complete all  required  OJT  or  are  certified  mission  ready  in  order  to  assume  and  reflect  duties  and responsibilities  IAW  AFI  36-2201,  section  6.7.1.

Superintendent.  For the purposes of duty title assignment in this AFI only, use for  a  CMSgt,  SMSgt  and  MSgt  that  is  the  senior  enlisted  leader  of  a  squadron-level equivalent  organization,  group-level  equivalent  organization,  joint  staff  or  joint operations  unit.    Squadron-level  equivalent  organizations  are  “centers,”  “institutions,” and  “agencies.”    When  appropriate,  organizations  with  subordinate  squadron-level organizations or direct responsibility for managing squadron-level organizations may be considered as group-level equivalent organizations.  In order to maintain the integrity of this  distinguished  duty  title,  use  of  the  term  “Superintendent”  will  be  reserved  for  only those positions with the highest span of control and scope of responsibility in a squadron-level equivalent or group-level equivalent organization.  Only SNCOs will hold the duty title  of  Superintendent.    For  manning  documents  and  performance  reports,  use  the  term “Superintendent.”   Note(s):  the  Joint  Functional  Component  Command  for  Space  is  considered  a  group-level equivalent  organization,  and  the  614  AOC  Combat  Operations  Division  is  considered  a squadron-level  equivalent  organization.    Therefore  “Superintendent”  is  authorized  for  these senior enlisted leader positions.   5.2.29.2.  Operations  Superintendent.    Use  for  a  SMSgt  or  MSgt  who  is  the  senior enlisted leader of the operations functions of a squadron.  Only SNCOs will hold the duty title of Operations Superintendent.

For  manning documents and performance reports, use the term “Career Fld Mgr.” NOTE:    Senior  Enlisted  Leader  (SEL).    Per  AFI  36-2109,  Chief  Master  Sergeant  of  the  Air Force  and  Command  Chief  Master  Sergeant  Programs,  unless  working  in  Reporting  Identifier 9E000  in  one  of  the  US  Unified  Commands,  Air  Force  enlisted  members  are  prohibited  from using the duty title “Senior Enlisted Leader.” It is a title commonly used to identify CCMs and their sister service equivalents within the joint environment. 5.3.  Duty Title (DTY) Codes.  For the 1C6X1 specialty, authorized duty titles may be reflected on  Unit  Manpower  Documents  (UMD)  in  lieu  of  the  “AFSC  Title"  (e.g.,  Journeyman, Craftsman,  etc.)  to  allow  the  user  to  identify  positions  by  unique  titles.    UMD  duty  titles  are associated  to  Manpower  Programming  and  Execution  System  (MPES)  DTY  codes.    MPES allows the Air Force to determine what skills are required for a position.  Management of MPES is outlined in AFI 38-201, Management of Manpower Requirements and Authorizations. 5.3.1.  DTY  codes  provide  the  CFM  and  MFMs  with  the  ability  to  identify  manpower authorizations by duties which provides a higher fidelity organizational structure.  A robust organizational  structure  gives  managers  greater  ability  to  analyze,  evaluate,  and  compare grade  allocations  to  the  specialty’s  ability  to  meet  and  sustain  tactical,  operational,  and strategic needs.   5.3.2.  Duty titles on Enlisted Performance Reports (EPR), duty history, etc. are established administratively via Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) action.  The UMD DTY code has  no  direct  connection  or  correlation  to  how  EPR  duty  titles  are  determined.    However, they  have  the  potential  to  erroneously  influence  the  duty  titles  that  are  applied  on  EPRs which  may  have  misleading  or  negative  impacts  to  aligning  Airmen  appropriately  for professional development. 5.3.3.  DTY codes assigned to duty titles are unique to each MAJCOM so UMDs reflecting similar duty titles may have differing DTY codes. 5.3.4.  When  MPES  DTY  codes  are  established  on  UMDs,  to  the  greatest  extent  possible, ensure  existing  personnel  are  assigned  to  positions  on  the  UMD  that  correctly  reflect  their primary duties.   5.3.5.  When  moved  between  authorizations,  to  the  greatest  extent  possible,  ensure  gained personnel are assigned to positions on the UMD that correctly reflect their primary duties.   AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 21 5.3.6.  When changes are made to manpower requirements, ensure the distribution of MPES DTY codes continues to reflect the organization’s needs. 22 AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 Chapter 6 1C6X1 AIR FORCE SPECIALTY CODE (AFSC) AWARD. 6.1.

They  are  established when  identifying  space  systems  operations  training,  skills  or  experience  as  critical  to  matching the right skills to the right place at the right time.  SEIs related to each space operations mission area are used to rapidly identify an already experienced resource to meet unique circumstances, contingency requirements or management needs.  They also provide a means to track individuals and identify positions requiring or providing unique experience or training that would otherwise be difficult to locate or identify.  SEIs will be managed IAW AFI 36-2101, (Classifying Military Personnel).    SEIs  have  been  established  in  the  AFECD  for  the  space  systems  operations specialty.  Most SEIs for space related duty are coded as Auto-Award within MilPDS allowing individuals serving in SEI-coded positions to be automatically awarded the SEI upon meeting the requisite  education,  training,  positional  certification,  skill  level,  and  number  of  months  of experience.  7.2.  Air Force Specialty Code Prefix.  The space systems operations specialty uses prefixes to identify specific requirements and individuals qualified to perform duty in the specific positions.  Prefix  award  is  managed  using  the  guidance  contained  in  Section  I  of  the  AFECD.    The following are the most commonly applied prefixes for 1C6X1 positions: 7.2.1.  Enlisted Force Development (D-Prefix).  Identifies positions on manpower documents and enlisted personnel serving in or qualified to serve in positions provided by the functional community during the Enlisted Developmental Team (EDT) panels. 7.2.2.  Contingency/War  Planner  (R-Prefix).    Identifies  positions  on  manpower  documents and  enlisted  Airmen  serving  in  or  qualified  to  serve  in  positions  requiring  functional  area expertise and training in contingency or war planning functions. 7.2.3.  Formal  Training  Instructor  (T-Prefix).    Identifies  positions  on  manpower  documents and enlisted Airmen serving in, qualified to serve in, or receiving formal instructor training to qualify to serve in formal training instructor positions. 7.3.  SPDP.  SPDP  is  an  AF-level  personnel  development  program  designed  to  build  space experts who thoroughly understand the medium of space, from concept to sustainment, including design, acquisition, fielding, operations, and maintenance.  The SPDP is a multi- faceted plan to ensure deliberate, purposeful individual development highlighted by expanded space education, training,  and  experience-building  opportunities.    The  elements  are  formalized  through  a  three-level  certification  program  to  create  and  manage  a  knowledgeable  cadre  to  meet  the  nation’s space needs and national security objectives.   7.3.1.  Policy.    Per  AFPD  36-37,  Space  Professional  Development,  credentialed  space professionals  are  expected  to  attain  appropriate  education,  training  and  experience commensurate  with  their  rank,  responsibilities  and  career  progression,  as  mandated  by approved  space  professional  certification  standards.    At  a  minimum,  SPDP  is  designed  to improve  joint  warfighting  knowledge  and  skills,  and  prepare  individuals  in  space-related duties to assume progressively higher levels of responsibility.  SPDP identifies, and certifies space  professionals’  skills.    Certification  provides  a  structure  to  systematically  characterize 26 AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 the  depth  and  breadth  of  skills  across  all  specialties  in  the  space  professional  community.  For  1C6X1  personnel,  SPDP  is  managed  IAW  AFI  36-3701,  Space  Professional Development Program. 7.3.2.  SPDP  Tiers.    The  three  tiers  of  SPDP  certification  are  tailored  for  the  Total  Force. Space  professionals  progress  from  a  foundation  of  technical  competency  (Tier  1),  through demonstrated  depth  of  knowledge  and  experience  in  application  (Tier  2),  to  extensive knowledge  and  experience  in  space  and  warfighting  operations  (Tier  3).  Criteria  for  the various  levels  are  tied  to  education,  training  and  experience.    For  1C6X1  personnel,  SPDP tiers directly relate to the “types of work” the member should be targeted to perform.  7.3.2.1.  Tier  1  –  Operator.    In  this  entry-level  phase  of  development,  space  systems operations technicians should focus on developing depth in their assigned space system.  Tier 1 is normally attained in conjunction with Combat Mission Ready (CMR) status (or equivalent, for those not required to be CMR). 7.3.2.2.  Tier 2 – Integrator.  In this mid-stage of development, space systems operations technicians  transition  to  first  line  supervisor  and  mid-level  leadership/management positions. 7.3.2.3.  Tier  3  –  Manager.    In  this  advanced-stage  of  development,  space  systems operations  professionals  apply  the  depth  and  breadth  of  experience  gained,  combined with leadership and management skills. 7.3.3.  Space Professional  Experience Codes (SPECs).  SPECs  provide: common identifiers that  enable  the  matching  of  space  skills  to  job  requirements;  identification  of  cumulative space  experience  based  on  duty  effective  dates;  common  space  experience  for  the  Total Force  and  any  specialty  or  functional  group;  applicability  to  positions  and  people  used  to establish space billet requirements and identify the experience gained while in the position; and  the  ability  to  track  a  broad  range  of  mission/functional  categories.    See  AFI  36-3701, Space Professional Development Program, for a breakout of all SPECs. 7.3.4.  Space Professional - Single Unit Retrieval Format (SURF).  The most common SPDP product  is  the  space  professional  SURF;  a  snapshot  of  each  individual’s  Air  Force  duty history  tailored  to  provide  relevant  data  such  as  SPECs  and  accumulated  time,  space education  completed  and  certification  level.    Management  of  Space  professional  SURFs  is outlined in AFI 36-3701, Space Professional Development Program. AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 27 Chapter 8 STRATEGY FOR TRAINING, EDUCATION, EXPERTISE AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (STEEP) 8.1.  Overview.  The  strategy’s  goals  are  to:  deliberately  develop  technical  depth  and  breadth through  space  training,  education  and  experience;  instill  an  operational  understanding  of  how space  capabilities  are  best  woven  into  joint  warfare;  cultivate  a  space  warfighter  culture;  and equip  the  specialty  to  strategically  integrate  capabilities  into  joint  warfighting  and  intelligence operations.    STEEP  executes  force  development  (FD)  by  connecting  training,  education,  and experience  opportunities  to  build  and  enhance  institutional,  occupational,  and  cross-functional competencies in individual Airmen.  It establishes a professional development model based on a combination  of  exposures,  experiences,  and  expertise  over  the  career  of  1C6X1  professionals, and  directly  supports  enterprise  and  institutional  force  development  programs  that  ensure  we have the right person, with the right education and training, in the right job, at the right time in their  career.    See  Figure  8.1.  (Strategy  for  Training,  Education,  Expertise  and  Professional Development).  Figure 8.1.  Strategy for Training, Education, Experience and Professional Development (STEEP).  28 AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 8.2.  Formal  Training.  Space systems operations technicians attend formal training courses as identified below.  Course descriptions, content and prerequisites are found in the Education and Training  Course  Announcements  (https://etca.randolph.af.mil).    Refer  to  the  AFECD  and CFETP  for  detailed  requirements  for  skill  level  upgrade.    Formal  training  covers  a  variety  of tasks  listed  under  specific  categories.    (See  the  1C6X1  CFETP,  Part  II,  Specialty  Training Standard,  for  detailed  tasks  and  references.)    Figure  8.2.  (1C6  Formal  Education  and  Training Delivery  Plan)  illustrates  the  progression  of  in-resident  and  correspondence  formal  instruction.  Following  completion  of  EUST,  1C6X1  personnel  are  developed  for  both  mission  depth  and space enterprise depth.  Space systems operations personnel require an intricate understanding of the weapon system(s) they  employ and the mission(s) they directly support,  as well as  a broad perspective  of  the  collective  relationships  and  effects  of  the  space  enterprise.    The  authority  to waive  formal  training  requirements  for  the  1C6X1  specialty  is  AF/A35  or  designated representative.   NOTE:  IAW AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel, for mandatory training requirements for  the  AFSC,  waiver  authority  equivalent  to  that  of  the  AFCFM  is  delegated  to  the  headquarters level Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command CFMs for their Reserve Component.  Figure 8.2.  1C6 Formal Education and Training Delivery Plan. 8.2.1.  EUST.    All  space  systems  operations  candidates  are  required  to  attend  EUST  in-residence as initial skills training for award of the 3-skill level.

The  authority  to  waive  7-skill  level  CDC  requirements  for  the 1C6X1 specialty is AF/A35. 8.2.4.  Education  and  Training  Documentation.    All  space  systems  operations  training, qualifications,  certifications,  and  evaluations  will  be  documented  IAW  all  applicable instructions. 8.2.4.1.  CFETP.  The CFETP is a comprehensive core education and training document that  identifies  life-cycle  education  and  training  requirements,  training  support  resources and  minimum  core  task  requirements  for  the  specialty.    This  plan  identifies  the mandatory skill level training that Airmen must receive during their military careers and provides a clear career path to success in all aspects of career field training.  Completion of EUST (Initial Skills Training) and CDCs (skill level upgrading) training objectives are outlined on the Specialty Training Standard and will be documented IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program. 8.2.4.2.  Core Tasks.   Core tasks identify the minimum  qualification requirement for all personnel  within  an  AFS,  regardless  of  duty  position.    Due  to  the  wide  range  of  space systems  operations  mission  areas,  weapon  systems,  and  duty  positions,  there  are  no designated  core  tasks  associated  to  the  AFSC  in  addition  to  the  education  and  training received through EUST and CDCs.     8.2.4.3.  Home  Station  Training.    Specific  tasks  and  qualifications  related  to  individual weapon  systems  and  duty  positions  are  trained  during  Initial  Qualifying  Training, Supplemental  Training,  Mission  Qualification  Training  and  other  non-AFSC  awarding training  required  to  meet  mission  ready  standards.    Home  station  training  will  be accomplished  and  documented  IAW  AFI  36-2201,  Air  Force  Training  Program  and other applicable supporting direction put into effect at the unit, group, wing, NAF, and/or MAJCOM levels.  Supporting documentation may add fidelity and be more but not less stringent than AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program. 8.2.4.4.  Technical sergeants and below.  An AF Form 623, On-the-job Training Record, will be maintained for all personnel serving in the rank of technical sergeant and below, IAW AFI 36-2201, 6.7.1.7. 8.2.4.5.  Exception  to  Policy.    To  meet  unique  requirements,  1C6X1  training  may documented in six-part folders (hardcopy or approved electronic equivalent) in lieu of an AF Form 623, On-the-job Training Record, so long as documentation remains IAW AFI 36-2201,  Air  Force  Training  Program,  and  that  MAJCOM’s  supporting  instruction(s).  Multiple methods of documentations (hardcopy and approved electronic equivalent) will 30 AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 not be utilized simultaneously by the 1C6X1 specialty.  Waiver authority is the AFCFM with approval from AF/A1DLT.  8.3.  Space  Professional  Development  Continuum.  Space  education  does  not  end  at  EUST.  Space professional development is a continual lifecycle of education and progressive experience management spread throughout a space systems operations career.  Development hinges on three areas:  depth  of  experience,  breadth  of  experience,  and  education  and  training,  as  depicted  in Figure 8.3. (Development Matrix for Enlisted Personnel in Space Systems Operations). 8.3.1.  Supplemental Space Education and Training.  1C6X1 personnel are offered a variety of  in-resident,  correspondence,  and  distance  learning  professional  education  and  training opportunities (on and off duty) to gain breadth and depth, maintain a high degree of subject matter  expertise,  and  supplement  perishable  knowledge  and  skills.    Education  and  training opportunities  include  self-study  of  technical  orders,  professional  papers,  computer-based training offerings, etc. 8.3.2.  Education  and  Training  for  Types  of  Work.    1C6X1  professionals  are  offered education  and  training  opportunities  that  are  targeted  for  application  in  specific  “types  of work.” Figure 8.3.  Development Matrix for Enlisted Personnel in Space Systems Operations.  AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 31 8.4.  NSSI.  NSSI  is  the  DoD’s  single  focal  point  for  space  education  and  training, complementing  existing  space  education  programs  at  the  Air  University  and  the  Air  Force Institute of Technology.   The  cornerstone of SPDP  is  a space education  continuum  of learning (CoL) that reinforces space cultural awareness throughout a space professional’s career.

Purpose.  Deliberate  force  development  advances  all  Airmen  through  a  career-long process carefully synchronizing the key components of education, training and experiences. It is dynamic  and  purposeful  by  design,  enabling  personnel  development  to  meet  occupational, operational,  institutional, and strategic leadership requirements.  Placing the right  people in  the right  place  at  the  right  time  is  an  imperative.    Reference  AFI  36-2640,  Executing  Total  Force Development,  and  AFRCI  36-2640,  Executing  Air  Force  Reserve  Force  Development,  for additional information. 10.2.  Methodology.  Enlisted deliberate development is realized through the guidance, direction and  execution  of  Functional  Advisory  Councils  (FAC)  and  EDTs.    Through  FACs  and  EDTs, enlisted career field leadership executes progression planning and succession planning to ensure Air  Force  specialties  are  effectively  equipped,  developed  and  sustained  to  provide  the  required capabilities to accomplish the mission. 10.3.  1C6X1 FAC Roles and Responsibilities: 10.3.1.  Overview.    FACs  prepare  senior  leaders  with  a  comprehensive  understanding  of functional, cross-functional and institutional personnel requirements pertaining to a particular career field and advises on management strategies to sustain and improve capabilities. 10.3.2.  FA.    IAW  AFI  36-2640,  Executing  Total  Force  Development,  FAs  establish,  chair and  convene  the  FAC  when  necessary.    FACs  are  convened  to  provide  strategic-level oversight  to  the  functional  community  under  their  guidance  and  support  the  force development and force structure management processes.  FA may delegate responsibility to the FM. 10.3.3.  AF/A3: 10.3.3.1.  Chairs  the  13SX/1C6X1  FAC  (may  delegate  this  responsibility  to  the  CFM) and determines FAC membership.  The 1C6X1 CFM should be a participating member in the FAC.   10.3.3.2.  Provides  guidance  to  13SX/1C6X1  FAC  membership  to  ensure  force development processes are in support of career field management and planning. 10.3.3.3.  Reviews recommendations as appropriate.   the  13SX/1C6X1  FAC findings  and  approves/disapproves 10.3.4.  CFM: 10.3.4.1.  Facilitates the FAC.  Summarizes the FAC’s recommendations, submits to the FM for consideration and, if applicable, forwards EDT approval to AFPC/DPAP. 10.3.4.2.  Ensures  the  FAC  validates  key  developmental  positions  (KDPs)  and  key leadership  positions  (KLPs)  and  coordinates  with  the  owning  manpower  office  to  code the positions with a D-prefix on the respective UMDs. 10.3.5.  FAC Members.   36 AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 10.3.5.1.  The FM determines FAC membership. 10.3.5.2.  The FAC should include the CFM and MAJCOM-level functional leadership as well as other key force development stakeholders. 10.3.5.3.  Certain  cross-functional  communities,  such  as  Communications,  Intelligence Operations  or  Cyberspace  Operations,  have  valid  force  development  requirements involving  Airmen  assigned the  space  systems  operations  functional  AFSC.  Representatives from these communities may attend applicable FACs with prior approval from the FM. to 10.3.6.  FAC Responsibilities. 10.3.6.1.  Validate  the  career  progression  roadmap  by  comparing  career  field  needs (requirements)  against  career  field  capabilities  (inventory),  providing  a  summary  of projected  requirements  (to  include  grade,  AFSC,  experience  level,  and  number  of  valid personnel authorizations that must be filled). 10.3.6.2.  Identify  developmental  goals  of  the  career  field.  Discussions  should  include topics  such  as  cross-functional  requirements  review,  releasing  Airmen  for  outside-the-AFSC  opportunities,  preparing  Airmen  for  institutional  Air  Force  leadership  positions, the role of diversity within the career field, and sustaining perishable skill sets. 10.3.6.3.  Determine  career  field  capability  to  satisfy  identified  requirements,  meet developmental  goals  and  perform  the  mission.    Any  capability  gaps  must  be  resolved through changes in progression plan, force management initiatives or EDTs.  10.3.6.4.  If  FAC  chair  responsibility  is  delegated,  the  FAC  provides  the  FM  a recommendation  for  executing  an  EDT.    A  recommendation  to  conduct  an  EDT  should only be provided if the FAC identifies either of the following conditions exist: KDPs are necessary to provide Airmen specific education, training or experience which cannot be obtained  through  normal  training/education,  progression  planning,  or  assignment processes; and/or KLPs (as defined in 1.2.2.) require Airmen to have specific education, training, experience, or performance qualifications. 10.3.6.5.  If  an  EDT  is  executed,  the  FAC  should  utilize  EDT  feedback  to  identify existing and potential career field capability gaps. 10.3.6.6.  Review CFETP for progression currency. 10.3.6.7.  Communicate  developmental  goals  to  the  career  field  through  an  updated career progression roadmap and direction to career field leadership.  Career feedback can be  accomplished to  MFMs  for dissemination, Webinars, or other similar process. information,  sending  emails through  posting 10.3.7.  FAC Establishment.  FACs should convene at least annually and should make every effort to be held in conjunction with other career field meetings where a majority of the FAC and  EDT  members  will  be  in  attendance.    Or,  the  FACs  may  be  held  virtually  (Defense Connect Online, Video Teleconference, etc.). 10.4.  1C6X1 EDT Roles and Responsibilities: 10.4.1.  Overview.    Development  Teams  (DTs)  are  the  responsibility  of  the  FA,  FM  and AF/A1.  The Air Force  relies on the DTs to  be the conduit between the force development AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 37 systems,  frameworks  and  policy  and  translate  these  into  career  vectors  for  individuals.  Specific DT guidance is addressed in AFI 36-2640, Executing Total Force Development, and AFRCI36-2640,  Executing  Air  Force  Reserve  Force  Development.    EDTs  provide  vectors based  on  projected  (or  anticipated)  aggregated  requirements  by  grade,  level,  and  position type.    A  vector  is  an  EDT’s  collective  recommendation  for  an  experience  level,  training  or education  opportunity,  or  position  type  for  an  Airman’s  next  or  subsequent  assignment.  EDTs  ensure  a  career  field’s  senior  leadership  becomes  familiar  with  Airmen  assigned  to their  functional  area  and  assesses  Airmen’s  qualifications  and  potential  for  future opportunities.    EDTs  must  be  executed  in  the  most  cost-efficient  manner  possible.    This includes taking full advantage of  remote capabilities, conducting EDTs in conjunction  with other  scheduled  meetings,  and  minimizing  the  need  for  AFPC  support  and  resources  to execute EDTs. NOTE:  The  Air  Force  Reserve  executes  their  Enlisted  Development  Teams  independently  of Active  Duty  RegAF.    Reference  AFRCI  36-2640,  Executing  Air  Force  Reserve  Force Development. 10.4.2.  AF/A3: 10.4.2.1.  Reviews  the  13SX/1C6X1  FAC  recommendations  of  whether  an  EDT  is warranted  and  new  Enlisted  Quarterly  Assignments  Listing  -  Plus  (EQUAL-Plus) advertisements  are  needed  to  facilitate  vector  requirements.    Recommendations  to  hold EDTs  and/or  create  additional  EQUAL-Plus  advertisements  will  be  forwarded  to AFPC/DPAP if approved. 10.4.2.2.  Develops charters for the 13SX/1C6X1 EDTs and reviews annually, revising as appropriate. 10.4.2.3.  Chairs the 13SX/1C6X1 EDTs (unless delegated to a designated representative) and determines EDT membership.   The enlisted  CFM may  execute the 1C6X1 EDT on behalf of the AF/A3. 10.4.2.4.  Approves  the  removal  or  cancellation  of  assignment  actions  for  Airmen ineligible for KDPs and KLPs upon recommendation by the CFM and AFPC. 10.4.3.  CFM: 10.4.3.1.  Consults  AF/A1P  and  AF/A1M  on  force  management  and  force  sustainment data analyses and execution. 10.4.3.2.  Identifies the career field’s KDPs and KLPs. 10.4.3.3.  Assigns  developmental  SEI  to  specific  types  of  positions  to  vector  enlisted Airmen.    For  example:  MFM  –  SEI  716;  AETC  Training  Manager  –  SEI  717; Superintendent  (Large  Squadron)  –  SEI  718;  Superintendent  (Small  Squadron)  –  SEI 719.  These SEIs will be utilized to identify Airmen vectored to key positions only, and are not associated with any special experience or training.  NOTE: SEIs 716 through 730 have been reserved specifically as developmental SEIs, and will be updated and removed by AFPC/DPAA. 10.4.3.4.  Schedules  EDTs,  as  necessary,  to  perform  succession  planning  for  KDPs  and KLPs. 38 AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 10.4.3.5.  Solicits  information  pertaining  to  enlisted  Airmen  being  considered  for  EDT vectoring.   10.4.3.6.  Prior  to  execution  of  the  EDT,  the  CFM  will  determine  the  eligibility  criteria (for  all  personnel  within  a  given  rank)  and  coordinate  with  AFPC/DPAPF  to  identify eligible personnel that will be considered for vectoring.  This allows the EDT to review current force capabilities in comparison to the career field requirements. 10.4.4.  Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC): 10.4.4.1.  (AFPC/DPAP)  Coordinates with CFMs (and CFM designated representatives) to provide access to personnel information necessary to conduct EDTs. 10.4.4.2.  (AFPC/DPAP)  Provides  guidance,  as  needed,  to  career  field  personnel responsible  for  loading  personnel  data  into  the  AFPC-established  developmental  team (DT) tool for use by EDTs.  in  conjunction  with 10.4.4.3.  (AFPC/DPAA3)  Utilizes  approved  EDT  vectors assignment  criteria  to  identify  eligible  candidates  to  fill  positions  upon  vacancy consistent with approved policy and needs of the Air Force.   10.4.4.4.  (AFPC/DPAA3)  Utilizes approved EDT vector lists to vet eligible volunteers for vectored  assignments,  and performs  assignment  action considering the most eligible volunteer from the EDT vector list.  If there are no eligible vectored volunteers, the most eligible vectored non-volunteer will be selected for the position.  If the EDT vector list is exhausted  and  a  vacancy  occurs  in  a  KDP  or  KLP,  AFPC  will  notify  and  work  closely with the CFM to determine the most effective means to fill the position.  Position vectors will remain valid until updated by CFMs through the EDT process.   10.4.4.5.  (AFPC/DPAA3)  Coordinates  with  enlisted  CFM  in  situations  where  Airmen assigned  or  projected  to  KLPs  are  ineligible  based  on  the  position  requirements.    Any discrepancies  will  be  reconciled  between  AFPC  and  the  CFM  (and  CFM  designated representatives).   10.4.4.6.  (AFPC/DPAA3)  Adds/deletes EDT SEIs to Airmen’s records after each EDT. 10.4.5.  Chiefs’ Group (AF/DPE): 10.4.5.1.  Utilizes EDT vectors to fill identified CMSgt positions upon vacancy consistent with needs of the Air Force. 10.4.5.2.  Publishes  EQUAL  Plus  advertisements  for  CMSgt  positions  identified  by CFMs through the EDT process and approved by FMs. 10.4.5.3.  Vets  volunteers  against  the  EDT  vector  list  and  selects  the  most  eligible volunteer.  If there are no volunteers, the most eligible Airman on the EDT vector list will be  selected  for  the  position.    All  discrepancies  will  be  reconciled  between  the  Chiefs’ Group and CFM. Position vectors remain valid until updated by CFMs through the EDT process. 10.4.6.  Enlisted  career  field  leadership  at  lower  levels  (i.e.,  supervisors,  flight  chiefs, squadron superintendents, etc.): 10.4.6.1.  Review and understand career field health and development goals. AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 39 10.4.6.2.  Review  capabilities  of  local  personnel  inventory  in  comparison  with  career field goals. 10.4.6.3.  Utilize  existing  resources  and  the  career  field  progression  plan  to  develop Airmen. 10.4.7.  EDT Members.    Ideally, the EDT  will be co-chaired by the 13S  CFM and the 1C6 CFM,  and  include  MAJCOM-level  functional  leadership,  and  other  career  field  strategic-level  senior  leaders  within  or  closely  related  to  the  1C6X1  specialty  (i.e.,  9G100  -  Group Superintendent, core 1C6X1 personnel serving in Special Duty, etc.).   10.4.7.1.  The CFM may execute the EDT on behalf of the FM.   10.4.7.2.  MSgt  EDTs  panels  typically  consist  of  chief  master  sergeants,  chief  master sergeant selects, senior master sergeants, and senior master sergeant selects.  10.4.7.3.  SMSgt  EDTs  panels  typically  consist  of  chief  master  sergeants  and  chief master sergeant selects.  10.4.7.4.  CMSgt  (1C600)  EDT  is  co-chaired  by  AF/A35  and  AFSPC/A2/3/6,  with  a panel typically consisting of three to five General Officers serving in positions related to or in direct support to space systems operations. NOTE:  EDTs  for  ranks  lower  than  master  sergeant  must  be  coordinated  with  AFPC/DPA  and approved by the FM. 10.4.8.  EDT Responsibilities.  EDTs will  understand career field  policies, plans, programs, training, and actions affecting career field management and development, and will take these matters into consideration when vectoring.  There are four distinct phases of EDT operations: planning, preparation, execution, and post execution.  The planning phase is where the EDT pre-work  begins.    The  CFM  initiates  the  process  by  delivering  an  official  message  to  the eligible personnel in the respective career fields. 10.4.8.1.  In the preparation phase of the EDT, the CFM will: coordinate with AFPC on the date and location of the EDT; coordinate with AFPC to identify Airmen eligible for vectoring;  designate  a  career  field  representative  to  coordinate  with  AFPC  on  all transactional  matters  (i.e.,  load  personnel  data  into  the  DT  tool);  and  solicit  input  and volunteer status from Airmen and their supervisors through vector worksheets. 10.4.8.2.  During  the  execution  phase,  the  CFM  will:  review  career  field  health  and developmental  goals;  review  identified  KDP/KLP  requirements  and  qualifications; review  personnel  records  of  the  identified  eligible  Airmen;  vector  qualified  Airmen  for KDP/KLPs based on requirements; if required, vector non-qualified Airmen to KDPs in order to obtain experience necessary to qualify them for KLPs; and determine if there are enough qualified Airmen in the inventory to meet projected vacancies in KLPs. 10.4.8.3.  During  the  post-execution  phase,  the  CFM  will:  provide  resulting  vectors  to AFPC/DPAA  and  AF/DPE;  provide  feedback  to  eligible  Airmen  and  their  supervisors; establish a method to provide aggregate feedback to the entire career field regarding the EDT  process,  career  field  goals  and  other  appropriate  information;  develop/maintain EDT minutes (required) to capture the overarching guidance, processes utilized, number of personnel vectored, and lessons learned from the EDT; and provide the FAC feedback to drive any needed changes to the career field progression plan or sustainment strategy.  40 AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 10.4.9.  EDT  Establishment.    An  EDT  will  only  be  established  and  executed  upon recommendation  by  the  FAC  and  approval  by  the  FM.    EDTs  are  scheduled  with consideration  given  to  the  timing  of  promotion  releases  for  the  designated  ranks.    Figure 10.1.  (Development  Team  Battle  Rhythm  for  Enlisted  Personnel  in  Space  Systems Operations) depicts the notional annual cycle.   Figure 10.1.  Development Team Battle Rhythm for Enlisted Personnel in Space Systems Operations.  10.5.  Deliberate  Development.  When  compatible  to  Air  Force  needs,  career-minded  Airmen should serve in a variety of duty positions that support the professional development of not only themselves, but those they serve.   10.5.1.  Mentoring.  Mentoring is an inherent responsibility of supervision and leadership and is  an  essential  ingredient  in  developing  well-rounded,  professional  and  competent  future leaders.  Mentors are advisors and guides who share knowledge, experiences, and advice in helping mentees achieve their career goals.  Space professionals are encouraged to be and to actively  seek  mentors  both  internal  and  external  to  their  chain  of  command.    Follow instructions for mentoring provided in AFMAN 36-2643, Air Force Mentoring Program.  10.5.2.  Progression  Planning.    Progression  planning  is  the  responsibility  of  the  CFM  and applies to all personnel in the career field.  For most AFSCs, the progression plan developed AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 41 through  the  Specialty  Training  Requirements  Team  and  the  Utilization  and  Training Workshop  is  sufficient  to  technically  develop  Airmen  in  the  ranks  of  airman  basic  through master sergeant.  The CFM utilizes input from the FAC and EDT to develop and adjust the career field progression plan as needed. 10.5.3.  Succession Planning.  Succession planning is the responsibility of EDTs and entails identifying KDPs and KLPs, and ensuring a bench of qualified candidates is available to fill those  positions.    Succession  planning  typically  happens  at  the  senior  master  sergeant  and chief master sergeant ranks. 10.5.4.  Developmental  Needs  Analysis  (DNA).    While  individual  records  of  performance may  be  compared  to  understand  and  trend  the  norms  within  the  specialty  (e.g.,  leadership positions,  mission  exposure,  education,  PME,  diversity  and  inclusion,  quality  force indicators,  etc.),  the  focus  must  be  to  derive  the  career  opportunities  that  are  in  the  best developmental  interest  of  the  individual  and  that  support  the  career  field’s  ability  to  fill existing/projected Air Force requirements.  The EDT is NOT a promotion board.  Therefore, records should not be scored in a fashion that may be perceived as a collective stratification, endorsement, or a promotion recommendation by the EDT.  10.5.5.  Vectoring.  The vectoring process aims at purposefully guiding the career growth of Airmen.  As  Airmen  develop  in  breadth  and  depth  of  technical  experience,  they  will  also progress through appropriate leadership positions and/or opportunities.  Assignment vectors are the EDT’s collective recommendation for an experience level or position type a member should  be  considered  for  during  the  upcoming  EDT  cycle  (12  months  following  board execution).  The vectors themselves DO NOT constitute an actual assignment, but are added fidelity  to  requirements  provided  to  HQ  AFPC/DPAA3  (Space  Assignment  Team).  Assignments are matched IAW AFI 36-2110 (Assignments).  Vector types for MSgt, SMSgt and CMSgt are listed in Figure 10.2. (Space Systems Operations Enlisted Development Team Vector Types). 42 AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 Figure 10.2.  Space Systems Operations Enlisted Development Team Vector Types.  AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 43 Chapter 11 ASSIGNMENTS AND CAREER BROADENING  11.1.  AB  thru  SMSgt  1C6X1  Assignment  Management.  IAW  AFI  36-2110,  Assignments, AFPC/DPAA3  manages  enlisted  assignments  for  space  systems  operations.    Several  factors influence  the  assignment  matching  process.    Figure  11.1  (Sample  1C6X1  Assignment  Process Considerations)  illustrates  a  sampling  of  the  factors  (not  all  inclusive)  that  help  determine requirements  and  priorities  of  positions  to  fill,  and  the  quantity,  eligibility  and  availability  of potential candidates. Figure 11.1.  Sample 1C6X1 Assignment Process Considerations.  11.2.  Broadening.  Space  systems  operations  professionals  should  pursue  opportunities  when available  and  appropriate  for  development,  both  within  the  specialty,  as  well  as  other institutional areas.  Professionals experienced in multiple space mission areas are better suited to serve  as  “operational  integrators”  and  “strategic  managers.”    Developmental  opportunities enhance leadership perspectives and prepare Airmen for “senior leader” roles. 11.3.  AF Developmental  Special Duty (DSD).  The Air Force has placed special emphasis on certain special duties based on their broad impact on Airmen, families and the future of the Air Force.  DSD is a deliberate eligibility and selection process that allows commanders to nominate their best performers for special duties that create, develop and care for Airmen.  The nominative process is based on a minimum quota for each major command that is levied every six months. instructor  duty, 11.4.  IST  Formal  Instructor.  For  3-level  awarding individuals in the ranks staff sergeant to master sergeant must be an approved candidate on the Air  Force  DSD  Nomination  list.    Vacancies  will  NOT  be  advertised  on  the  Assignments technical  school 44 AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 Management System (AMS).  Senior airmen and senior master sergeants are selected for 3-level awarding  technical  school  instructor  duty  via  AMS.    Candidates/applicants  for  IST  formal instructor duty must meet all qualifications.  HQ AETC and the hiring authority reserve the right to review and validate a member’s eligibility.  11.5.  Special  Duty  Release.  Release  from  the  1C6X1  career  field  to  accept  DSDs  and  other special  duty  assignments  is  supported  to  the  greatest  extent  possible.    AFPC/DPAA3  is responsible  for  managing  special  duty  assignments  for  1C6X1  personnel.    Approval  will  be granted on a first come, first served basis to eligible applicants.  The normal application process must be followed as specified for each special duty.  See the Special Duty Catalog (SPECAT) for special duty minimum requirements 11.5.1.  The  CFM  will  determine  the  total  number  of  SrA  -  SMSgts  permitted  to  serve outside  the  AFSC  each  fiscal  year.    AFPC/DPAA3  will  not  approve  requests  that  result  in dropping  any  1C6  skill-level  world-wide  manning  percentage  below  95%  without  CFM approval. Careful consideration must be given to timing and backfill actions when individual applicants are filling mission critical or one-deep duty positions. 11.5.2.  Eligible  applicants  must  meet  assignment  and  special  duty  requirements  as prescribed by AFI and AFPC policy.   11.5.3.  During  transition  periods  when  personnel  are  entering  and  returning  from  special duty, quotas may be exceeded with CFM approval.   11.5.4.  Professional  development  within  the  AFSC,  career  field  manning  and  skill-level health are primary factors when the CFM considers applications for extended absence from the space operations career field. 11.5.5.  With  the  exception  of  First  Sergeant  (8F000),  following  initial  special  duty  tour obligation  (normally  2-4  years),  all  follow-on  special  duty  commitments  and  extensions outside of the space systems operations career field must be approved by the 1C6X1 CFM.  Personnel serving as 8F000 may be extended and/or retained for a follow-on tour if they are selected  for  promotion  to  SMSgt  while  serving  as  a  First  Sergeant  upon  approval  of  the 8F000 CFM. 11.6.  CMSgt  Development.  Space  systems  operations  CMSgts  are  developed  and  utilized  in functional  (Career  Field  Management  track)  and  institutional  (Command  CMSgt  track)  duties that  prepare  them  for  key  developmental  and  key  leadership  positions  within  the  specialty  and Air  Force  at-large.    Figure  11.2.  (CMSgt  Development  Paths  for  Space  Systems  Operations) depicts the functional and institutional paths for the 1C600 CEM code.   AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 45 Figure 11.2.  CMSgt Development Paths for Space Systems Operations. 11.7.  CMSgt  Assignment  Management.  Per  AFI  36-2110,  Assignments,  Air  Force  Chief Master  Sergeant  Management  Office  (AF/DPE)  is  responsible  for  all  chief  master  sergeant assignments.  Chief master sergeants (including chief master sergeant selects) may be assigned in any AFSC or Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) code they possess or are qualified to be awarded.    JOHN W.

responsible  for  contributing  to  and  implementing  policies and  guidance/procedures  pertaining  to  his/her  functional  area(s)  (e.g.,  heads  of  functional  two-letter offices).  Air Force Specialty (AFS)—A group of manpower positions requiring common qualifications.  Each AFS has a title and a code. Air  Force  Specialty  Code  (AFSC)—A  combination  of  numbers  and  alpha  characters  used  to identify  an  AFS.  Officer  AFSCs  consist  of  four  characters;  enlisted  AFSCs  consist  of  five characters.  Alpha  prefixes  or  suffixes  are  used  with  the  numerical  codes  when  specific identification  of  position  requirements  and  individual  qualifications  is  necessary.  Refer  to  AFI 36-2101, Tables 1.1. and 1.2. for explanation of codes. Airman—Any US AF member (officer or enlisted; active, reserve, or guard; and civilians) who supports and defends the US Constitution and serves our country. 50 AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP)—Identifies  education  and  training requirements  for  every  career  field  to  prepare  Airmen  to  meet  mission  challenges.  Serves  as  a road map for career progression. Career Field Manager (CFM)—AF focal point for a designated career field within a functional community.  Serves  as  the  primary  advocate  for  the  career  field,  addressing  issues  and coordinating  functional  concerns  across  various  staffs.  Responsible  for  career  field  policy  and guidance. Must be appointed by the FM and hold the rank of chief master sergeant for enlisted Airmen. Competencies—Observable,  measurable  pattern  of  knowledge,  skills,  abilities,  behaviors,  and other characteristics needed to perform institutional or occupational functions successfully. Continuum  of  Learning  (CoL)—Career-long  process  of  individual  development  where challenging experiences are combined with education and training through a common taxonomy to  produce  Airmen  who  possess  the  tactical  expertise,  operational  competence,  and  strategic vision to lead and execute the full spectrum of AF missions. Critical  Leadership  Position—defined  as  a  unique  “no-fail”  position  with  distinguishing responsibilities  and  identified  education,  training,  experience,  or  performance  requirements which cannot be realized through normal progression planning and may not be prevalent in the majority of the career field.   Developmental  Vector—A  recommendation  from  a  DT/EDT  to  an  individual  and  his  or  her assignment team of an experience to be gained for the development of the individual (e.g., joint, Air Staff, Command, etc.). Education—Process of imparting general bodies of knowledge and habits of mind applicable to a  broad  spectrum  of  endeavors  to  intellectually  prepare  individuals  to  deal  with  dynamic environments  and  solve  ill-defined  problems  by  using  critical  thought  and  reasoned  judgment.  Education  programs  prepare  Airmen  to  anticipate  and  successfully  meet  challenges  across  the range of military operations and build a professional corps.  Further, they positively impact both recruitment and retention efforts. Enlisted  Development  Team  (EDT)—EDTs  provide  key  input  on  functional  progression  and succession  planning.  They  execute  enlisted  vectoring  and  identify  key  leadership  and developmental positions in their functional communities.  The CFM and EDT chair collaborates with AF/A1 and AFPC on enlisted force development and management programs. EQUAL—Provides  Airmen  a  listing  of  assignment  requirements  available  for  upcoming assignment cycles and allows Airmen the opportunity to align personal preferences to AF needs.

Force Development (FD)—A deliberate process of preparing Airmen through the CoL with the required  competencies  to  meet  the  challenges  of  current  and  future  operating  environments. Institutional  development  generally  results  in  leadership,  management,  enterprise,  and  warrior skill  proficiency.  Occupational  development  generally  results  in  flying  and  technical  skill proficiency. Functional  Advisory  Council  (FAC)—A  forum  of  functional  representatives  that  meets  to discuss  how  to  best  prepare  senior  leaders  with  a  comprehensive  understanding  of  functional, cross-functional,  and  institutional  personnel  requirements  as  they  pertain  to  a  particular  career field. Functional  Authority  (FA)—Senior  leaders,  to  include  Assistant  Secretaries  (SES),  Deputy Chiefs of Staff (three-star), and other selected HAF two-letter GO/SES-level leaders that provide corporate perspective of institutional requirements and force management and development. The FA  serves  as  a  final  authority  to  ensure  all  policies,  established  in  accordance  with  this document, are implemented within their functional community. FAs are supported by FMs who are supported by CFMs. Key  Developmental  Position  (KDP)—A  KDP  or  “unique  developmental  position”  is  used  to complement  leadership  qualifications.    These  positions  are  utilized  to  provide  experience necessary  for  KLPs  that  may  not  be  gained  through  the  normal  assignment  system.    The  CFM reviews and validates KDPs for relevance prior to each EDT. Key  Leadership  Position  (KLP)—A  KLP  or  “critical  leadership  position”  is  defined  as  a unique,  “no-fail”  position  with  distinguishing  responsibilities  and  education, training, experience,  or  performance  requirements  that  cannot  be  realized  through  normal  progression planning,  and  may  not  be  prevalent  in  the  majority  of  the  career  field.

Failure to have a qualified individual in this position could have severe consequences. Professional  Military  Education  (PME)—Critical  subset  of  developmental  education  that:  1) provides the nation with personnel skilled in the employment of air, space, and cyberspace power in the conduct of war, small scale contingencies, deterrence, peacetime operations, and national security;  2)  provides  AF  personnel  with  the  skills  and  knowledge  to  make  sound  decisions  in progressively  more  demanding  leadership  positions  within  the  national  security  environment; and  3)  develops  strategic  thinkers,  planners,  and  war  fighters.    In  addition,  PME  programs strengthen the ability and skills of AF personnel to lead, manage, and supervise. Progression Planning—career field planning designed to provide the proper education, training and experience necessary to develop the majority of the career field. Skill Level—An enlisted AFSC denoting an individual’s highest level of qualification. Enlisted personnel  must  complete  all  mandatory  training  requirements  as  outlined  in  AFI  36-2201,  the specialty description in the AFECD on the AFPC web site, and the applicable CFETP for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels. 52 AFI13-601  2 NOVEMBER 2015 Space  Professional  Functional  Authority  (SPFA)—The  SECAF-appointed  FA  for  the  Space Professional community.

This  involves  the  coaching  and  mentoring  of  Airmen, resulting in proficiency development.   Unit  Manpower  Document—The  UMD  is  the  primary  document  that  reflects  the  manpower required  to  accomplish  the  unit’s  mission.  It  is  a  computer  product  that  lists  unit  manpower requirements, both funded and unfunded, and is used to help manage manpower resources. The UMD  contains  many  data  elements  identifying  the  unique  attributes  of  a  position  including position number, AFSC, functional account code, work center, grade, number of authorizations, and personnel accounting symbol data. Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW)—CFMs use the U&TW process to develop and review training programs within an AFS or civilian occupational series. The goal of the U&TW process  is  to  develop  the  architecture  for  effective  life-cycle  training  to  be  provided  at appropriate points throughout a career path and to ensure that personnel  within the specialty or series are properly employed. Vector—The  EDT  collective  recommendation  for  an  assignment  level  (e.g.,  Joint  Staff, MAJCOM,  installation-level,  etc.),  training,  or  education  opportunity,  or  position  type  (e.g., superintendent,  special  duty,  etc.)  a  member  should  be  considered  for  in  his  or  her  next  or subsequent assignments.
