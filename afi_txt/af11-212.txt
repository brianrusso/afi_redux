Overview.  This  instruction  provides  guidance  and  responsibilities  to  Air  Force  aircrew munitions  requirements.    This  instruction  is  applicable  to  all  Air  Force,  ANG  and  AF  Reserve units  who  authorize,  allocate,  expend,  or  manage  aircrew  munitions.  MAJCOMs  may supplement this AFI as required, provided that the supplement is coordinated with AF/A5R-C to ensure overall compliance with this AFI. 1.1.1.  Aircrew  members  expend  munitions  during  combat,  training,  operational  readiness inspections,  weapons  competitions,  exercises,   Munitions management  and  loading  procedures  are  outlined  in  accordance  with  AFI  21-101,  Aircraft and  Equipment  Maintenance  Management,  AFI  21-201,  Conventional  Munitions Maintenance  Management,  and  AFI  25-101,  War  Reserve  Materiel  (WRM)  Program Guidance  and  Procedures.    Agencies  requiring  aircrew  type  munitions  will  assist  with forecasting  and  validating  munitions  requirements,  managing  unit  munitions  allocations, munitions expenditure reporting, and providing operational expertise. tests,  or  demonstrations. 1.1.2.  DoD  Instruction  3000.4,  DoD  Munitions  Requirements  Process  (MRP),  para  4.1, directs the Military Departments to establish munitions requirements, in accordance with the Guidance  for  Development  of  the  Force  (GDF)  and  Guidance  for  the  Employment  of  the Force  (GEF),  enabling  military  forces  to  perform  their  assigned  military  mission.    The munitions requirements shall: 1.1.2.1.  Address  the  operational  objectives  of  the  Combatant  Commanders  against potential  threats,  consider  logistics  capabilities,  retain  residual  capability  to  perform continuing  missions  and  support  Current  Operation/Forward  Presence  Requirements (CO/FPR)  at  the  end  of  any  major  combat  operation  (MCO)  and  identify  sufficient  test and training munitions to achieve and maintain readiness. 1.1.3.  The  Air  Force  develops  and  publishes  the  Total  Munitions  Requirement  (TMR)  to support MRP reporting responsibilities.  DoDI 3000.4 defines TMR as follows: 1.1.3.1.  Total Munitions Requirement:  The sum of war reserve munitions requirements and Training and Testing Requirement (TTR). 1.1.3.1.1.  War  Reserve  Munitions  Requirement:  The  sum  of  combat  requirements, strategic readiness requirements, and CO/FPRs. 1.1.3.1.1.1.  Combat Requirement: The quantity of munitions required to equip a specified  force  structure  to  perform  its  assigned  military  mission  and  to  meet Combatant Command (COCOM) objectives, including munitions needed for risk mitigation. 1.1.3.1.1.2.  Current Operation/Forward Presence Requirements (CO/FPRs):  The sum  of  the  munitions  required  to  arm  forces  to  conduct  current  operations  and meet  forward  presence  obligations.    Forward  presence  includes  Global  Naval Force Presence Policy and operations as directed by the President. 1.1.3.1.1.3.  Strategic Readiness Requirement:  The quantity of munitions needed AFI11-212  23 AUGUST 2013   5  to arm forces not committed to support combat operations in the assigned MCOs, as  well  as  those  in  the  strategic  reserve.    Includes  any  additional  munitions requirements generated from treaties or statutory obligations to allies. 1.1.3.1.2.  Training and Testing Requirement (TTR):  Munitions required to train the force and support Military Department programs ensuring that weapons and platforms deliver  the  intended  effectiveness  (can  be  stated  as  an  annual  requirement,  a  FYDP requirement, and/or projected life cycle of each munitions).  Surveillance, acceptance testing, and production losses of munitions items are accounted for in this category. 1.1.3.2.  AF/A5R-C  accomplishes  its  obligations  to  DoD  MRP  using  the  Non-Nuclear Consumables Annual Analysis (NCAA) process.  Procedures outlined in this AFI support this effort by defining the test and training requirement portion of the overall munitions requirements. 1.2.  Forecasting Aircrew Munitions Requirements. 1.2.1.  The Ready Aircrew Forecasting Tool (RAFT) is an automated program that calculates aircrew training munitions requirements.   RAFT utilizes authorized aircrew ratios from AFI 65-503,  USAF  Cost  and  Planning  Factors,  numbers of  Primary  Mission  Aircraft Inventory (PMAI),  Primary  Training  Aircraft  Inventory  (PTAI),  Primary  Development/Test Aircraft  Inventory  (PDAI),  ratio  of  actual  Combat  Mission  Ready  (CMR)/Basic  Mission Capable (BMC) aircrew and the required events listed on the Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) tasking  message.    Formal  Training  Unit  (FTU)  and  Weapons  School  (WS)  requirements are based on the number of students forecasted and funded in the Programmed Requirements Document  (PRD)  per  course and the  number/types  of  items  required  to  complete syllabus events.   FTU  and  WS are  given direct  support munitions  for instructor  performance demonstration  requirements.    RAFT  uses test  plan  munitions  requirements  to  capture  test requirements. 1.2.2.  The  RAFT  program  allows  for  the  rapid  consolidation  and  standardization  of  Major Command  (MAJCOM)  test  and  training  munitions  requirements  into  a  single  USAF reference  document.    This  consolidated  source  directly  supports  munitions  allocation decisions that are made  in  conjunction  with  actual  munitions inventory availability.  RAFT can  also  illustrate  the  potential  impact  on  training  munitions  as  a  result  of  force  structure adjustments. 1.2.3.  Only  Primary  Mission  Aircraft  Inventory  (PMAI),  Primary  Training  Aircraft Inventory (PTAI), and Primary Development/Test Aircraft Inventory (PDAI) aircraft garner munitions  authorizations.    Attrition  Reserve  (A/R)  and  Backup  Aircraft  Inventory  (BAI) aircraft are not used in requirements computations. 1.2.4.  ACC/A3TW will develop and validate training and combat fly-away requirements and capture test requirements for all users except those noted in 1.2.4.1.  These requirements will be  submitted  to  AF/A5R-C  and  the  OO-ALC/GHGMB  Munitions  Division’s  Global Ammunition  Control  Point  no  later  than  the  suspense  date  published  in  the  Peacetime Conventional  Ammunitions  Requirements instruction memorandum. forecast  submission (PCAR) 1.2.4.1.  HQ  Air  Force  Material  Command  (AFMC)  and  HQ  Air  Force  Special Operations Command (AFSOC) will develop and validate training and combat fly-away   6  AFI11-212  23 AUGUST 2013 requirements and capture test requirements for their commands. These requirements will be  submitted  to  AF/A5R-C  and  the  OO-ALC/GHGMB  Munitions  Division’s  Global Ammunition  Control  Point  no  later  than  the  suspense  date  published  in  the  Peacetime Conventional  Ammunitions  Requirements  (PCAR)  forecast  submission  instruction memorandum. 1.2.5.  The 505th Combat Support Group website on the AF Portal Agile Munitions Support Tool  (AMST)  module  will  be  used  to  submit  and  manage  Out-of-Cycle  Requests  (OOCR) and Allocation Transfer Requests (ATR). 1.2.6.  Munitions  are  forecasted  using  correct  major  category  and  requirement  codes  to identify their intended use.  Use of munitions for other than their intended purpose is strictly prohibited.  A complete  list  of major category  codes resides in  AMST under the Reference Lists module. 1.3.  Munitions/Missile Shortages. 1.3.1.  AF/A5R-C will determine munitions use category prioritization when physical assets are not available to support requirements.   This determination will be approved by AF/A5R and briefed by AF/A5R-C at the beginning of the annual munitions allocation conference.  As a general rule, category prioritization will be as follows: 1.3.1.1.  Homeland Defense. 1.3.1.2.  Combat Fly-Away. 1.3.1.3.  Combat requirements. 1.3.1.4.  AEF Spin-up 1.3.1.5.  Test support. 1.3.1.6.  Higher Headquarters tasking. 1.3.1.7.  MAJCOM approved Weapons School and FTU syllabi. 1.3.1.7.1.  For  munitions  items  that  are  less  than  100%  supportable,  A5R-C  in coordination  with  ACC/A3TW  will  establish  allocation  percentages  supporting Weapons School and FTU syllabi requirements above “normal” aircrew RAP training and  will  attempt  to  support  these  requirements  to  the  highest  percentage  possible commensurate with the total available for allocation. 1.3.1.8.  Unit RAP training. 1.3.1.9.  Host  unit  support  of  deployed  unit  training  (e.g.  RED  FLAG;  GREEN  FLAG, Weapons  Instructor  Course  (WIC)  support,  Weapons  System  Evaluation  Program (WSEP) support, etc). 1.3.1.10.

Test items may include spare items in order to meet restrictive range or test time tables,  however  these  additional  items  must  be  identified  as  spare  items  and  are  authorized for use only when a primary item can not be used.  If testing requires additional test items, test managers will submit an OOCR. 2.10.3.  Increased range, complexity and lethality of many weapons routinely require the use of  a  Telemetry  (TM)  Instrumentation  Kit  (TIK)  and/or  Flight  Termination  System  (FTS) during  developmental  and  operational  test  and  evaluation  as  well  as  testing  during sustainment.  The guidance for forecasting and programming for these assets is contained in AFI  99-120,  Forecasting  and  Programming  Munitions  Telemetry  and  Flight  Termination Systems, and must be strictly adhered to. 2.10.4.  Programs  on  OSD  oversight  will  send  copies  of  MAJCOM  request/OOCR  to AF/TEP and USAFWC for visibility and support resolution.   12  AFI11-212  23 AUGUST 2013 Chapter 3 AIRCREW MUNITIONS REQUIREMENTS/AUTHORIZATIONS 3.1.  Non-Expendable Captive Carry Aircrew Training Munitions. 3.1.1.  Captive Carry Aircrew Training Munitions/Missiles are used for practice attacks with air-to-air and air-to-surface training munitions that emulate weapons switchology and attack profiles.  Units do not forecast these requirements.  ACC/A3TW will determine requirements based  on  anticipated  wartime  tasking  and  established  standards  in  coordination  with MAJCOMs.    (Reference;  Attachment  2  for  the  Non-Expendable  Captive  Carry  Aircrew Munitions  Load  Factor/Standards.    (With  the  exception  of  RPAs,  this  does  not  apply  to AFSOC). 3.1.2.  WS  and  FTU  units  may  forecast  for  inert/dummy  items  for  classroom  training requirements.    However,  these  forecasts  will  be  limited  to  inert  bomb  bodies,  fuzes,  fin assemblies,  and  other  small  component  items.    Items  that  are  all  up  rounds  such  as,    Joint Standoff    Weapon,  Wind  Corrected  Munitions  Dispenser  ,  Joint  Air  to  Surface  Standoff  Missile,  Small  Diameter  Bomb,  Terminal  Guided  Missile,  Captive  Air  Training  Missiles, etc., are not forecasted. 3.2.  Non-Expendable Air Munitions Training Authorization for Load and Ground Crews. 3.2.1.  Units,  managers,  and  custodians  will  forecast  for  the  minimum  quantities  of  non-expendable  air  munitions  required  to  provide  realistic  munitions  production,  maintenance, and weapons load crew training.  Forecasts will be compiled using the Air Force Standard for Non-Expendable  Air  Munitions  Training  Authorizations  obtained  on  the  AF/A4LW Sharepoint page https://cs.eis.af.mil/afmunitions/default.aspx. 3.2.2.  The  non-expendable  training  munitions  standards  provide  basic  requirements  for weapons  load  crew,  sortie  generation  operations,  combat  munitions  maintenance  training, nuclear  weapon  loading,  maintenance,  and  handling  training,  exercises,  evaluations, inspections, and competitions. 3.2.2.1.  The  standard  explains  how  these  authorizations  are  established,  reviewed  and revised.    These  authorization  standards  are  the  primary  source  used  to  forecast  non-expendable air munitions for training. 3.2.3.  Justifications  referenced  in  other  validated  Air  Force  and  Higher  Headquarters directives  that  identify  munitions  requirements  may  be  included  in  requirements  forecasts and may exceed the Air Force standard requirements, if fully justified. 3.2.4.  The OPR for these standards is AF/A4LW.  Submit comments, changes and suggested improvements concerning this standard and these authorizations through command channels to  AF/A4LW,  1030  Air  Force  Pentagon,  Washington  DC  20330-1030  or  through  e-mail: AF/A4LW Workflow.  AF/A4LW will coordinate changes with all OPRs and OCRs. 3.3.  Expendable Training Munitions. 3.3.1.  Aircrew  training  munitions  authorizations  are  based  on  flying  training  sorties/events as  set  by  the  Ready  Aircrew  Program,  approved  syllabus  training,  Test  Requirements, AFI11-212  23 AUGUST 2013   13  Operational  Readiness  Inspections  (ORIs),  select  exercise/competitions,  and  special demonstrations. 3.3.2.  Aircrew  training  munitions  requirements  are  calculated  using  RAFT.    ACC/A3TW will provide MAJCOMs/units with individual copies of the RAFT program for their review prior  to  the  annual  ACC  Test/Training  Munitions  Working  Group  conference.    (Does  not apply to AFMC or AFSOC.) 3.3.3.  For effective training, some training events (i.e., chaff/flare/20-30mm ammo, etc) may require more than one expenditure/event to complete.  When expenditures per event are not defined  by  appropriate  training  guidance,  the  individual  RAFT  tables  will  be  the  source utilized to derive the munitions requirement.  This RAFT table value will be established with a  consensus  of  MAJCOM/Unit  representatives  at  the  annual  ACC  Test/Training  Munitions Working Group (TTMWG), or via email. 3.3.3.1.  In  the  event  a  consensus  cannot  be  reached,  AF/A5R-C  will  use  the  ACC approved number from the most current Realistic Training Review Board (RTRB) to set the  maximum  allowable  value.    AF/A5R-C  may  establish  lower  values  in  order  to manage limited stockpiles and/or to allow for more-timely positioning of WRM assets in the field. 3.3.3.2.  Use of common event  definitions (number of items  per event) will  help  ensure equitable sharing between all users, especially where assets are not 100% supportable for training. 3.3.4.  Additional munitions may be authorized for ORIs, selected exercises/competitions, or certain special demonstrations.  The office of primary responsibility (OPR) will forecast and send  their  requirements  to  ACC/A3TW,  HQ  AFMC,  or  HQ  AFSOC  for  inclusion  into  the annual  forecast.    OPRs  are  the  MAJCOM  Inspectors  General,  and/or  the  appropriate exercise/competition OPRs.  These OPRs are responsible for ensuring munitions allocations are transferred to the tasked units. 3.3.4.1.  Additional  munitions are not  authorized for RED FLAG, GREEN FLAG, AEF spin-up, or most deployment/exercises.  During these deployments/exercises, aircrews are completing normal training events at an alternate location.  Every attempt should be made to forecast these requirements at the location they will be used. 3.3.5.  AFMC  will  establish  Developmental  Test  Pilot  Aircrew  Training  Munitions requirements in  accordance  with  AFI  11-2FTV1,  applicable  Command  or  Center Supplements and Instructions or interim guidance provided in Operations Group FCIFs.  Test Wings  will  use  AFMC  Munitions  Forecasting  Tool  to  compute  requirements  based  on number of Aircrew Authorized.  Wings will submit requirements to HQ AFMC/A3/A4MW, through  Wing  OG,  for  validation  and  submission.    HQ  AFMC/A3  will  submit  the consolidated  operations  arena  requirement  to  HQ  AF/A5RC  for  validation  and  to  HQ ACC/A3TW for comment.  Once validated, A5RC will post copies of the AFMC Forecasting Tool for that particular year to the AF/A5RC section of AMST. 3.4.  Developmental  and  Operational  Test  Munitions  are required to support Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E), Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E), Tactics Developmental and  Evaluation  (TD&E)  as  well  as  other  test  projects  such  as  Weapons  System  Evaluation   14  AFI11-212  23 AUGUST 2013 Program  (WSEP),  Air  Force  SEEK  EAGLE  Program  (SK),  and  major  System  Design  & Development (SDD) tests. 3.4.1.  Responsible Test Organizations (RTO) must forecast for the munitions needed for all tests.    RTO/Major  System  Program  Offices  (SPO)  will  consolidate  standard  munitions  test requirements and forecast by organization.  Munitions required to support test requirements should  be  allocated  to  a  specific  test  plan  or  directive.    RTOs  should  forecast  munitions requirements by Complete Round Code (CRC) whenever possible in lieu  of the component Master National  Stock  Number (MNSN).  MNSNs may  only  be used  when a CRC has not been developed, suitable substitutes are not available or incorrectly catalogued, or when the CRC  would  not  be  appropriate  for  use.    Telemetry  (TM)  Instrumentation  Kit  (TIK)  and/or Flight  Termination  System  (FTS)  requirements  must  be  considered  and  programming  for these  items  will  be  accomplished  IAW  AFI  99-120.  Test  munitions,  TM,  TIK,  and  FTS requirements will be projected concurrently with the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). 3.4.1.1.  Test forecasts may include spin-up requirements to maintain aircrew proficiency throughout the fiscal year.  However, back-to-back test using the same munitions should not  require  two  sets  of  spin-up  munitions.    Spin-up  requirements  will  be  identified separately from actual test requirements via requirement code. 3.4.1.2.  Expedited procedures may be used in cases where short notice testing is required due to unique situations (i.e., safety, potential reliability issues, expedited integration due to possible combat, etc).  Test agencies are strongly encouraged to submit their requests at the earliest possible time.  Expedited procedures are not a substitute for planned tests on a known schedule. 3.4.1.3.  When  assets  are  provided  by  an  aircraft  or  weapons  SPO,  allocations  will  be loaded  IAW  AFI  21-201  para  7.22.    Additionally,  any  Air  Force-owned  assets (components) used in combination with SPO provided assets require a valid allocation. 3.5.  Combat  Fly-Away  Munitions.  Combat  Fly-Away  munitions  are  specifically  intended  to equip  bomber,  fighter,  airlift,  Combat  Search  and  Rescue  (CSAR),  and  Special  Operations Forces (SOF) aircraft with munitions that could be employed enroute to the deployed location or would  reduce  aircraft  regeneration  or  aircrew  preparation  time  upon  arrival  at  the  deployed location. 3.5.1.  Combat Fly-Away munitions are a fly to  the fight authorization.  Units will load-out what they are tasked to load-out in the Deployment Order (DEPORD). 3.5.1.1.  Units  are  not  authorized  to  expend  combat  Fly-Away  munitions  for  test  and training  requirements  without  prior  written  approval  from  their  parent  MAJCOM.  Procedures  for  obtaining  approval  are  contained  in  AFI  25-101,  War  Reserve  Materiel (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures. 3.5.1.2.  Units are not authorized to use/load-out combat Fly-Away munitions during Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) rotations or AEF aircraft swap-outs unless specifically tasked to do so by deployment/operational order, air tasking order, or by higher headquarters. 3.5.1.3.  Air-to-Air  missiles  required  to  support  Fly-Away  will  be  supported  by  the TAMP program and allocations distributed via AMST. AFI11-212  23 AUGUST 2013   15  3.6.  Combat  Munitions  Requirements.  Combat  munitions  requirements  are  computed  by AF/A5R-C  using  the  Non-nuclear  Consumables  Annual  Analysis  (NCAA)  process.    Normally, CONUS units do not garner combat munitions allocations.  However, when the NCAA process identifies  specific  MDS  that  are  tasked  to  fly  CONUS-CONUS  combat  sorties,  gaining  theater commanders  will  coordinate  the  pre-positioning  of  a  portion  of  their  combat  allocation  at  the tasked unit with ACC/A3TW and ACC/A4LW. 3.7.  Tactical  Air Missile  Program (TAMP).  The TAMP document defines the processes and policy for computing live Air-to-Air missile requirements for Test, WRM, and Fly-Away.  This program  is  managed  by  AF/A5R-C  and  is  part  of  the  NCAA.    The  TAMP  document  is augmented by AFI 99-108, and must be strictly adhered to. 3.7.1.  All USAF Captive Carry missile requirements will be computed by ACC/A3TW IAW the standards in Attachment 2 using the Captive Carry Missile Forecasting Tool (CCMFT).  ACC/A3TW will provide MAJCOMs/units with individual copies of the CCMFT results for their  review  prior  to  the  annual  ACC  Test/Training  Munitions  Working  Group  and  AFMC Test Munitions Requirements conferences. 3.7.2.  Fly-Away  tactical  missile  requirements  will  be  developed  by  ACC/A3TW  and finalized at the TAMP conference. 3.7.3.  As  appropriate,  tactical  AUR  AIM-9  missiles  include  one  TMU-72  coolant  tank (argon  bottle)  per  allocated  missile.  An  additional  allocation  of  two  TMU-72  coolant  tanks per  allocated  Category  “G”  missile  will  be  allocated  to  facilitate  quick  turn  of  the  missiles during  combat  operations.  An  additional  allocation  of  one  TMU-72  coolant  tank  per allocated Category “F” & “T” missiles will be allocated to facilitate quick turn of the missiles during Fly-Away and Homeland Defense operations. 3.8.  Afloat  Prepositioned  Fleet  (APF)  Munitions  Vessels.  APF  munitions  are  swing-stocks designated for pre-positioning on the Afloat Prepositioned Fleet (APF). 3.8.1.  APF  ship  reconstitution  has  highest  priority  for  munitions  allocations  during  the allocation  cycle  the  reconstitution  is  to  be  performed.    Munitions  required  to  support reloading efforts may not be available for allocation to other tasks. 3.9.  Foreign  Military  Operations  and  Training  Munitions.  Foreign  military  operations  and training munitions requests will be provided to ACC/A3TW for inclusion in RAFT. 3.10.  Current Operations.  Current operations munitions are required for daily operations, such as airlift flights over hostile areas, drug interdiction, or homeland defense (i.e., Operation Noble Eagle)  for  protection  of  AF  installations,  equipment,  personnel,  and  homeland  security operations.  These munitions are not expected to  be expended, except during the course of real world/daily operational situations. 3.11.  Standard  Air  Munitions  Package  (STAMP).  STAMP  munitions  are  swing-stocks designated  for  pre-positioning  at  STAMP  locations  within  CONUS  for  rapid  deployment  to combatant  commands.    Operational  flying  units  do  not  garner  munitions  allocations  under  this category.   16  AFI11-212  23 AUGUST 2013 Chapter 4 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 4.1.  Reporting  Requirements.  Munitions are managed on a fiscal year (FY) basis and require several reports.  Use of CRC, MNSN, Department of Defense Identification Code (DoDIC), and nomenclature for aircrew munitions reporting is mandatory.  Use MNSN or DoDIC only when a CRC is not applicable or established. 4.2.  Aircrew  Munitions  Forecast.  Units  assist  in  validating  their  aircrew  munitions  forecast based on RAP requirements, MAJCOM, and ACC/A3TW guidance. 4.3.  Munitions Expenditure Reports.  Wings will provide ACC/A3TW (or owning MAJCOM A3 for AFSOC and AFMC units) a Mid-Year and End-of-Year expenditure report.  Reports are required  for  aircrew  munitions  only.    Ground  munitions  expenditures  are  not  required.  ACC/A3TW will provide a standard report format that will be available on the NIPRNET web page  for  unit  use.    If  needed,  to  suit  individual  unit  needs,  A3TW  will  assist  in  providing additional  pages/formats  as  required.    Expenditure  totals  will  be  coordinated  between  unit operations  and  the  MASO  before  submission  to  ensure  expenditure  quantities  are  accurate.  Allocation  balances  will  reflect  any  OOCR  and  transfer  adjustments.    Separate  reports  are required  for  Category  “D”  and  “E”  expenditures.    Expenditure  data  release  authority  is  the OG/CC or equivalent.  Note; HQ AFSOC and HQ AFMC will provide a command expenditure report to ACC/A3TW for inclusion into the USAF report. 4.3.1.  The  Mid-Year  report  is  due  NLT  14  March  each  year.    The  report  will  reflect expenditure rates for all allocated munitions.  This report must include a plan of expenditure execution if the total expenditure is less than 40% percent of the allocation for the  year the report referenced.  A comments field on the report format will be provided for this purpose.  At  this  point,  units  must  consider  returning  portions  of  allocations  for  anything  less  than  a 25% expenditure rate. 4.3.2.  The  End-of-Year  report  is  due  NLT  14  October  each  year.  The  report  will  reflect expenditure rates for all allocated munitions.  This report must include a justification (alibi) if the  total  expenditure  is  less  than  70%  percent  of  the  allocation  for  the  year  the  report referenced.    The  justification  must  be  specific,  i.e.,  operations  driven  limitation  (include weapons,  range,  deployment  issues),  logistics  related  limitation,  safety  related  limitation, manufacturer  related  (items  scheduled  for  delivery  direct  from  vendor  but  not  received),  or depot/transportation related (items delay by depot work or transportation delays, etc). 4.3.3.  Off-station  expenditures  must  be  included  in  munitions  expenditure  reports.    Off station  expenditures  apply  to  those  munitions  expended  at  another  location  to  which allocations  have  been  transferred.   If  allocations  have  not  been  transferred,  expenditures should  be  counted  against  home  station.    Do  not  report  expenditures  for  units  from  other MAJCOMs operating at an installation on a temporary basis. 4.3.4.  ACC/A3TW  will  provide  a  synopsis  of  the  consolidated  expenditures  with  alibis  to AF/A5R-C NLT the end of the calendar year. 4.4.  Forecast,  Allocation,  Expenditure  Timelines.  The  following  timeline  is  provided  as information only and is subject to change.  A firm timeline will be published in the annual PCAR AFI11-212  23 AUGUST 2013   17  instruction  memorandum  published  by ALC/GHGMB) in coordination with AF/A5R-C and AF/A4WC. the  Global  Ammunition  Control  Point  (OO-Table 4.1.

Allocation Management. 5.1.1.  Units may be allocated munitions items  in more than one category.  Munitions must be issued and expended for their intended purpose as identified by the category code. (Note:  Aircrew  munitions  are  managed  on  Stock  Record  Account  and  are  not  issued  to  Custody accounts.    Categorization  of  an  asset’s  expenditure  by  Category  code  occurs  after  actual expenditure,  not  before.    Assets  are  allocated  for  an  specific  intended  purpose  and  must  be expended against the appropriate category code. 5.1.2.  Units  will  monitor  allocations  closely  to  ensure  authorized  and  prudent  use  of munitions.    In  some  cases,  aircrew  munitions  are  allocated  at  less  than  100%  of  a  unit’s requirement.  Assets must be expended wisely throughout the fiscal year to ensure effective aircrew training. 5.1.3.  Wing  Weapons  Officers  (WWO)  will  analyze  expenditure  rates  quarterly  to  identify potential  excess  allocations.    When  WWO  determine  they  are  unable  to  use  (expend)  any portion  of  their  fiscal  year  allocation(s),  the  allocation(s)  will  be  transferred  back  to  their MAJCOM for possible redistribution to other USAF units. 5.2.  Out-of-Cycle Requests (OOCR).  An OOCR is the vehicle for obtaining new, changing, or increasing  munitions  annual  allocations.    The  Wing  Weapons  Officer  will  submit  OOCRs through  the  MASO  in  accordance  with  AFI  21-201  and  MAJCOM-specific  guidance.    OOCR submitted before an operational unit expends 70 percent of their current allocation may be denied unless  there  is  substantial  justification.    OOCRs  that  cannot  be  supported  locally  will  be submitted  to  the  MASO  using  the  AMST  module  from  the  OO-ALC/GHGMB  Munitions Division website on the AF Portal. 5.2.1.  MAJCOMs  must  add  comments  to  OOCRs  submitted  by  their  units.    Comments should  address  as  a  minimum,  additional  supporting justification,  current  asset (allocations/expenditures /transfers and relevant condition code) posture for the item and why it cannot be supported from within the unit of MAJCOM.  The intent is to ensure that units have tried to source the allocation within their chain of command first.  If unsupportable at the  requesting  Unit/Wing,  the  owning  MAJCOM  will  attempt  to  source  from  other command/unit allocations before submitting the OOCR to A5R-C. 5.3.  Complete  Round  Code  (CRC)  Conversions.  CRC  conversion  requests  (example; changing  a  live  bomb  allocation  to  an  inert  configuration)  will  be  in  the  same  format  as  an OOCR with the exception of the following additional information: “From CRC” and “To CRC” and do not require OG/CC signature. 5.4.  Allocation  Transfer  Requests  (ATR).  ATRs  are  accomplished  to  transfer  an  allocation from one unit to another unit and they may be within or between MAJCOMs.  A common use for ATRs would be to transfer unit munitions to an exercise location for use by that unit during their participation.  Owning MAJCOMs may direct a transfer from a unit that is unable to expend their allocation to another unit, or to accomplish higher priority training. AFI11-212  23 AUGUST 2013   19  5.4.1.  Units will transfer aircrew allocations IAW the directions in AFI 21-201.  As a general rule, allocation transfers between commands are completed by the deployed unit MASO after coordination with the MAJCOM. 5.4.1.1.  The  deployed  unit  MASO  in  coordination  with  the  wing  weapons  officer  will ensure  the  unit  has  sufficient  allocations  to  support  exercise  requirements  and  pass allocations to the supporting unit MASO not later than 60 days (CONUS-to-CONUS) and 90  days  (OCONUS-to-CONUS  or  OCONUS-to-OCONUS)  before  the  exercise  begins.  Allocation  transfers  inside  these  timelines  may  jeopardize  munitions  support  due  to supply/transportation  timelines  associated  with  the  need  of  requisitioning/sourcing munitions assets.  Timely transfers aid munitions personnel at the exercise location with the  planning  and  scheduling  of  munitions  support.  Supporting/gaining  units  have  seven (7) days to notify the transferring unit of any support issues. 5.4.2.  Requests to accomplish an ATR will be submitted to the MASO by the wing weapons officer using the format in AMST. 5.5.  After  Action  Reports  (AAR).  The purpose of an AAR is  to  document a deployed unit’s expenditures,  and  to  assist  in  returning  remaining  allocations  back  to  the  unit’s  home  station (where  the  original  allocation  came  from).    It  serves  as  reconciliation  between  quantity transferred in from a deployed unit and the actual quantity expended by the deployed unit. 5.5.1.  AAR should be accomplished in AMST immediately following the event, but must be accomplished no later than 14 days following the event.   20  AFI11-212  23 AUGUST 2013 Chapter 6 RECORDS MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING 6.1.
