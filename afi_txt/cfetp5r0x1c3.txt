Upon completion of basic military training and assignment to an AF career field, all enlisted personnel are registered in a CCAF degree program and are afforded the opportunity to obtain an Associate in Applied Science degree. In order to be awarded, degree requirements must be successfully completed before the student separates from the Air Force, retires, or is commissioned as an officer.
