The procedures will not duplicate, alter,  amend,  or  be  less  restrictive  than  the  provisions  of  this  basic  AFI  and/or  flight  manual publications. OG/CCs will forward one copy for validation to HQ ACC/A3CA, and if applicable through 9 AF prior to releasing their supplement. 1.4.  Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Terms  . See Attachment 1. AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 7 Chapter 2 MISSION PLANNING 2.1.  Mission  Development/Planning.  The  Squadron  Operations  Officer  (DO)  or  Deployed Detachment  Commander,  if  applicable,  will  actively  direct  the  execution  of  the  units  flying schedule.  The  Detachment  Commander  may  delegate  authority  to  another  officer  under  their authority.  The  aforementioned  will  ensure  that  all  operations  personnel  provide  crews  with  the requisite support to plan and execute the mission. They will ensure crews/mission planners have no  barriers  to  mission  planning  and  ensure  that  every  mission  is  thoroughly  planned,  briefed, executed,  and  debriefed.  The  responsibility  for  mission  planning  is  shared  between  the  aircraft and mission crew  commanders  and/or designated Mission  Planning Cell (MPC). Together they will ensure the JSTARS flight profile is adequately planned and the crew is properly prepared for mission tasking and execution. 2.1.1.  Scheduling.  Peacetime  execution  of  the  squadron’s  flying  schedule  shall  focus  on accomplishment  of  AFI  11-2E-8V1,  E-8  Aircrew  Training,  currency,  Ready  Aircrew Program (RAP) requirements and AFI 11-2E-8V2, Aircrew Evaluation Criteria. 2.1.2.  Mission  Planning, Briefing and Debriefing. Mission  planning will be defined in  AFI 11-2E-8  V3,  116  ACW  SUP  1.  Briefings  and  debriefing  guides  can  be  found  in  the  unit supplement. 2.1.3.  The  Aircraft  Commander  (AC)  will  ensure  the  JSTARS  flight  profile  is  adequately planned and all flight and crew safety factors are considered. The Mission Crew Commander (MCC)  will  ensure  the  mission  crew  has  the  proper  materials  and  is  properly  prepared  for mission tasking and execution. 8 AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 Chapter 3 AIRCREW OPERATING PROCEDURES 3.1.  General  .  A PIC is designated for all flights on the flight authorization. PICs are: 3.1.1.  Responsible for the safe accomplishment of the flight. 3.1.2.

After  48  hours,  the  crew  must  be  launched,  released,  or  entered  into  pre-departure crew rest. Crew duty day begins when the crew is alerted for duty. 3.10.4.  Aircraft  Alert  Procedures.  Aircraft  will  be  prepared  for  alert  launch  IAW  T.O.  1E- 8C-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series Aircraft, E-8C, and unit supplement. AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 13 Chapter 4 FLIGHT CREW OPERATING PROCEDURES 4.1.  General  .  This  chapter  contains  operating  procedures  applicable  to  the  flight  crew.  This information is in addition to AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-401, and applicable MAJCOM supplements. 4.2.  Adverse Weather 4.2.1.  Icing Restrictions.  Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited (T-2). Prolonged operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be  avoided.  When  freezing  fog,  freezing  drizzle,  or  freezing  rain  is  forecast  or  reported, aircrew  will  confirm  with  supporting  weather  personnel  the  intensity  and  type  of  icing associated with the freezing precipitation. 4.2.1.1.  Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing precipitation as defined by AFI 11-202V3 (T-2). 4.2.1.2.  Freezing/frozen  precipitation  (freezing  rain,  drizzle,  snow,  fog,  or  temperatures near zero degrees Celsius, etc.) may cause ice or frost to accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When an aircraft requires deicing/anti-icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following: 4.2.1.2.1.  Flight crew will be familiar with and follow all procedures and restrictions in  T.O.  1E-8C-1,  Flight  Manual  and  T.O.  1E-8C-1-1,  Performance  Manual,  with respect  to  de-ice/anti-ice  procedures.  Further  guidance  is  provided  in  T.O.  42C-1-2, Anti-Icing, De-Icing, and Defrosting of Parked Aircraft. 4.2.1.2.2.  MIL-A-8243  Type  I  and  Type  II  de-icing  fluids  do  not  provide  any  anti- icing benefit, and therefore do not have holdover times. As a guide, for approved anti-icing  fluids,  crews  may  use  published  anti-icing  holdover  times  IAW  T.O.  42C-1-2 and  winter  season  holdover  tables  available  on  the  AFFSA  website.  Caution:  Using official snowfall/precipitation intensity reports will underestimate anti-icing holdover times.    The  guidelines  use  non-standard  terminology  and  definitions  regarding  the term  “snowfall  intensity.”    Until  the  tables  are  corrected,  the  snowfall/precipitation intensity  from  an  official  weather  observation  or  forecast  should  not  be  used  in conjunction with the published tables. 4.2.1.2.2.1.  The holdover time begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and is affected by intensity/type of precipitation, time, temperature, and type/dilution of mixture.  PIC  shall  use  this  information  to  determine  when  holdover  time  is exceeded and re-apply fluid if required. 4.2.1.2.3.  The PIC will ensure the following information (4-element code) is received from the deicing ground crew after anti-icing is complete: 4.2.1.2.3.1.  Element A. Element A specifies the type of anti-icing fluid (e.g. Type IV). 4.2.1.2.3.2.  Element  B.  Element  B  specifies  the  percentage  of  fluid  within  the fluid/water mixture (e.g. 75/25 is 75% fluid and 25% water). 4.2.1.2.3.3.  Element C. Element C specifies the time of the beginning of the anti-14 AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 icing  step.  All  holdover  times  are  based  on  this  value.  All  times  are  based  on Local (L) time. 4.2.1.2.3.4.  Element D. Element D specifies the date (day, written month, year). The date will be consistent with local time. 4.2.1.2.4.  In  all  cases,  PICs  or  their  designee  will  ensure  a  visual  inspection  is completed within prior to departure. 4.2.2.  Turbulence Restrictions. Do not fly in areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence. Every  effort  will  be  made  to  avoid  areas  of  reported  moderate  turbulence.  If  moderate turbulence is forecast along planned route of flight, the AC should determine the best altitude to  avoid  the  moderate  turbulence.  If  moderate  or  severe  turbulence  is  encountered,  the  AC will exit the conditions using the most expeditious method possible. 4.2.3.  Thunderstorm Avoidance. Pilots will neither file a flight plan route nor fly into an area of known or forecast thunderstorm activity when the weather radar is inoperative or unusable and thunderstorm activity cannot be visually circumnavigated IAW AFI 11-202V3 criteria. 4.2.4.  Temperature Correction.  IAW AFI 11-202V3 and the ACC Supplement. 4.3.  Takeoff and Landing. 4.3.1.  Pavement.  Runway/taxiway  length  and  width  limitations  are  defined  by  AFI  11-202V3,  ACC  Sup.  Crews  will  reference  the  Instrument  Flight  Rules  (IFR)  Supp,  Airfield Suitability  and  Restriction  Report  (ASRR)  and  the  T.O.  1E-8C-1-1,  Flight  Manual,  USAF Series Performance Data, E-8C Aircraft to determine the ability of the E-8C to land/taxi at an airfield based on planned operating weights. 4.3.2.  Runway  Length  for  Takeoff.  Takeoffs  will  be  initiated  from  the  beginning  of  the approved usable portion of the runway. Minimum runway length for takeoff is critical field length. 4.3.3.  Use of Overruns.  If  approach end overruns are available, stressed and authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for takeoff. Departure end overruns (if stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing if needed. 4.3.4.  Rolling  Takeoffs.      Should  be  made  whenever  critical  field  length  permits  and  IAW T.O  1E-8C-1  and  T.O.  1E-8C-1-1.  Aircraft  will  normally  takeoff  and  land  on  the  longest suitable runway. 4.3.5.  Takeoff and Landing Data. All takeoff and landing data will be computed by the FE IAW T.O. 1E-8C-1-1. The AC, CP, or an additional FE will check the takeoff and emergency return  data.  Computerized  Flight  Planning  Software  and  other  programs  approved  by  the OG/CC are approved for computing Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD). 4.3.5.1.  Use  of  Mission  Accomplishment  Method  for  calculating  TOLD.  Mission accomplishment is defined as using the benefits  of headwind and slope to accomplish a takeoff  and  landing.  Unless  otherwise  noted  on  the  applicable  chart  in  T.O.  1E-8C-1-1, crews will not use mission accomplishment methods to accomplish takeoffs or landings without  OG/CC  or  equivalent  approval.  Operational/contingency  operations  may  use mission accomplishment methods at the AC discretion, if the situation warrants. AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 15 4.3.5.2.  Mission  Accomplishment  Method  for  Obstacle  Clearance  will  only  be  used when  operational/contingency  missions  dictate  IAW  T.O.  1E-8C-1-1  and  AFMAN  11-217V1, Instrument Flight Procedures. 4.3.6.  Takeoff  Thrust  Setting.  All  peacetime  sorties  will  use  reduced  thrust  procedures  as described  in  T.O.  1E-8C-1-1.  See  AFI  11-2E-8,  Vol  3,  116  ACW  SUP  1  for  conditions allowing Takeoff Rated Thrust (TRT) takeoffs. 4.3.7.  Tailwind. Takeoffs and landings with a tailwind are not recommended. If operational necessity or Air Traffic  Control (ATC) considerations dictate, a tailwind takeoff or landing may be accepted IAW T.O. 1E-8C-1-1. 4.3.8.  RCR  (Runway  Condition  Report).  Aircraft  will  not  takeoff  or  land  when  reported RCR is  less than 10.  The OG/CC has the  authority to  waive the minimum  RCR to  7 when operational  necessity  warrants  (T-3).  Some  airports  may  report  the  average  RCR  value,  in this case the pilot will ask for the minimum RCR recorded on the runway. Aircrews will not conduct ground operations (taxi or towing) with RCR less than 7 (T-2). 4.3.9.  Crosswinds.  Unless  further  restricted  by  aircraft  gross  weight  or  emergency conditions, the following crosswind limits apply unless waived to aircraft limits by OG/CC. 4.3.9.1.  Maximum crosswind component (gust included) for takeoff or landing on a dry runway is 25 knots. 4.3.9.2.  Takeoff maximum crosswind on a wet runway is 20 knots. 4.3.9.3.  Landing maximum crosswind on wet runway is IAW T.O. 1E-8C-1-1. 4.3.9.4.  Maximum  crosswind  for  touch-and-go  operations  is  15  knots  for  an  IP  and  10 knots for a touch-and-go qualified AC. 4.3.10.  Departures.  AFI  11-202V3  permits  crews  to  depart  Visual  Flight  Rules  (VFR)  and climb to an IFR Minimum En Route Altitude (MEA) or conduct a VFR departure to join an IFR flight plan as a last resort for mission accomplishment. 4.3.10.1.  The  crew  becomes  solely  responsible  for  air  traffic  separation,  terrain  and obstacle clearance, and maintaining VFR cloud clearances until rejoining their IFR flight plan at the IFR MEA. There is no peacetime mission that requires use of this procedure in lieu of being able to  vertically clear all obstacles along the planned departure path  with one engine inoperative. 4.3.10.2.  This  procedure  will  not  be  used  in  lieu  of  meeting  a  required  climb  gradient (i.e.  obstacle  or  ATC)  without  OG/CC  or  higher  approval.  This  procedure  will  not  be used as a means to increase fuel loads for missions. 4.3.10.3.  Special  Departure  Procedures  (SDP)  use  and  certification  (IAW  AFI  11-202V3). 4.3.10.3.1.  E-8 crews are authorized to use SDPs. 4.3.10.3.1.1.  The  applicable  OG  will  determine  who  can  approve  the  use  of  a SDP. 4.3.10.3.1.2.  Crews  must  be  certified  to  use  SDPs.  The  E-8  SDP  Training  PPT dated  18  Dec  13  (or  newer  versions)  is  the  MAJCOM’s  approved  training 16 AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 material and is available from OGV. Upon completion of training the individual’s training folder will be appropriately annotated. 4.3.11.  Aircraft Category. The E-8 is a category D aircraft. Some landing configurations and gross  weight  combinations  will  require  the  use  of  category  E  minimums.  Refer  to  Flight Information Publication (FLIP) General Planning (GP) for guidance. 4.3.12.  Maximum  Landing  Gross  Weight.  Landing  gross  weight  will  not  exceed  247,000 pounds  under  normal  conditions.  Landing  at  gross  weights  greater  than  247,000  pounds during  an  emergency  is  at  the  discretion  of  the  AC.  If  mission  requirements  dictate,  the OG/CC  may  authorize  landings  over  247,000  pounds,  provided  all  other  landing requirements can be safely met. 4.3.13.  Landings.  All  landings  will  be  flown  so  as  to  touchdown  in  the  designated touchdown zone (1000-2000 feet). If it appears that the actual touchdown will occur beyond the first 1/3 or 3,000 feet (whichever is less) of the landing runway, initiate a go-around. 4.3.13.1.  All  normal  full  stop  landings  will  be  planned  to  not  exceed  the  normal  brake energy or landing distance limits. 4.3.13.2.  When  landing  on  a  dry  runway,  braking  may  be  delayed  until  runway remaining equals computed landing distance. 4.3.13.3.  Multiple  Full  Stop  Landings.  The  FE  will  determine  the  brake  energy  used during  landing  and  then  using  the  decision  speed  (V1),  without  headwind  correction, determine the brake energy for an abort during a subsequent takeoff. Do not takeoff until the combined energy after ground cooling is less than 40 million ft-lbs. If takeoff is made with brake energy above 10 million ft-lbs., air-cooling procedures will be followed. Note: FE  should  consider  brake  energy  accumulated  during  taxi  because  brake  application during taxi can add large amounts of heat to the brakes. 4.3.14.  Transition. Transition is defined as any approach or landing other than one to a full stop. 4.3.14.1.  Military,  Joint  Use  and  Civilian  Airfields.  IAW  AFI  11-202V3  aircrew  may conduct  transition  training  at  all  military,  joint  use  and  civil  (P)  airfields  within  the continental  United  States  that  meet  the  restrictions  found  within  this  publication. Conducting  transition  at  civilian  airfields  requires  WG/CC  or  higher  approval  and advanced permission from the airport manager or designated representative. 4.3.14.2.  ACs  will  ensure  transition  is  planned  during  ATC  hours  of  operation  and  in compliance with Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs) and bird restrictions. 4.3.14.3.  Flight crews should take bird strike potential into consideration when planning transition. 4.3.14.4.  Crews  should  notify  the  Supervisor  of  Flying  (SOF)  when  able  prior  to accomplishing unscheduled transition. 4.3.14.5.  Seat swaps during transition should be made on the downwind leg of either the IFR or VFR traffic pattern. 4.3.15.  Arresting Cables (does not include recessed cables). AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 17 4.3.15.1.  Do  not  land  on  approach  end  arresting  cables.  If  the  aircraft  lands  before  the cable, the crew should contact the tower to have the cable inspected. 4.3.15.2.  Do not takeoff or land on a runway with raised arresting gear reported as slack, loose  or  improperly  rigged  by  NOTAM,  Automated  Terminal  Information  Service (ATIS), or ATC. 4.3.16.  Airfield Certification. All pilots and staff mission planners will reference the Airfield Qualification program information as directed by AFI 11-202V3 and the ACC Supplement. In  addition,  they  will review the AMC  Airfield  Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) and  should  contact  HQ  AMC/A36  for  updates  to  airfield  operability  and  weight  bearing capability if required. The Airfield Suitability Help Desk (DSN: 779-3112) can answer most airfield questions 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. 4.4.  Airborne and Simulated Emergencies.  Pilots should notify the SOF or the controlling C2 agency  of  any  emergency  or  potentially  hazardous  situation  as  soon  as  practical.  No crewmember will use the term “emergency” when communicating with external agencies, until specifically  authorized  by  the  AC.  The  AC/IP  will  accomplish  the  final  approach  and  landing unless  the  situation  prevents/dictates  otherwise.  Simulated  emergency  procedures  practice  will be  terminated.  A  written  record  of  the  emergency  situation  will  be  provided  to  the  appropriate safety office as soon as possible. 4.4.1.  Fuel  Dumping.  Fuel  dumping  will  be  conducted  only  to  reduce  gross  weight  in  an emergency or for operational necessity. When circumstances permit, dump fuel above 5,000 feet AGL over unpopulated areas or in designated fuel dump areas. Avoid circling descents. Advise  the  appropriate  air  traffic  control  agency  of  intentions,  altitude,  and  location,  when beginning fuel  dumping  and when the operation has been  completed. Make the appropriate entry in the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. 4.4.2.  In-flight  Troubleshooting.  Aircrews  will  not  conduct  in-flight  troubleshooting  after tech  order  emergency  procedures  are  completed.  Once  a  malfunctioning  system  is  isolated, that system should not be used again unless essential for safe recovery. 4.4.3.  Simulated  Emergency  Procedures.  Simulated  emergency  procedures  are  flight  deck procedures where the normal configuration of the airplane is altered (i.e., an engine pulled to idle  to  simulate  the  loss  of  an  engine).  All  aircraft  systems  will  be  restored  to  normal operation prior to landing, except for simulated engine-out landings.   Flight crew “simulated emergency procedures” should not be used synonymously with “simulated emergency drills” accomplished by the mission crew. 4.4.4.  Prohibited Simulated Emergencies. 4.4.4.1.  Engine failure takeoff continued below 200AGL. 4.4.4.2.  Multiple or combined simulated emergencies. 4.4.4.3.  Three-engine  rudder  boost-out  operations  (one  engine  at  idle  and  rudder  boost off);  however,  three  engine  rudder  boost  out  procedures  may  be  practiced,  e.g.,  one engine at idle and rudder boost on. 4.4.4.4.  Practice actual engine shutdown, except during functional check flights (FCF). 4.4.4.5.  Practice approach to stall recovery. 18 AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 4.5.  Diverts  .  The  AC  will  ensure  Airfield  Ops,  the  SOF  or  the  controlling  C2  agency  are notified  as  soon  as  practical  and  request  assistance  coordinating  transportation,  security, classified storage, and lodging, as required. 4.6.  Fuel  Requirements and Optimization  . Flight planning and flight routes will be planned to  optimize  fuel  efficiency  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  while  ensuring  mission accomplishment.  Engine  start  times  should  normally  occur  no  earlier  than  30  minutes  prior  to takeoff. Missions may terminate after training is completed. 4.6.1.  The AC/FE are responsible for monitoring the fuel status and updating bingo time/fuel as appropriate for weather and mission status. 4.6.2.  Cruise. Crews will normally fly optimum altitude/long range cruise speed for en-route legs greater than one hour, weather and ATC permitting. 4.6.3.  Orbit. Orbit speeds will maximize Fuel/Mission  Radar Performance/Self Defense, as applicable. 4.6.4.  Missions should be planned to arrive overhead the destination/worst case alternate fix with  no  less  than  15,000  pounds  fuel,  or  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-202V3,  whichever  is greater. 4.6.4.1.  Minimum landing fuel is 12,000 pounds. If it becomes apparent the aircraft will land  with  12,000  pounds  of  fuel  remaining  or  less,  declare  “Minimum  Fuel”  and  land short of destination; or divert as required. 4.6.4.2.  Emergency landing fuel is 10,000 pounds. 4.6.5.  Aircraft  Ground  Refueling.  FEs  must  monitor  ground  refueling  when  qualified maintenance and or fuels personnel are not available or cannot provide assistance. 4.6.5.1.  Off-station  Ground  Refueling:  Defense  Fuel  Supply  Points  (DFSP)  located  on military installations should be used to procure aviation fuel to the max extent possible. 4.6.5.1.1.  When  DFSP  resources  are  not  available  use  Defense  Energy  Support Center  (DESC)  Into-Plane  contract  fuel  providers  to  the  maximum  extent  possible. When  using  the  DESC  Into-Plane  contract  location,  ensure  to  procure  the  correct contracted product. If the wrong product is purchased, then the unit will be charged a non-contract price.  If a non-contract vendor is used at a contract location units will be  charged  a  non-contract  price.  When  no  DESC  into-plane  contract  exists  at  a commercial  airport  location, units are authorized to  purchase fuel  and services from any  commercial  vendor  that  has  a  Merchant  Agreement  with  Multi  Service Corporation (MSC) that accepts the Air Card contract.  (DESC-I-31). 4.6.5.1.2.  A  list  of  DESC  into-plane  contract  merchants  for  each  contracted  airport location  can  be site (https://cis.energy.dla.mil/energy_cis/)  via  the  “Into  Plane  Contract  information System.” the  Defense  Logistics  Agency  web found  on 4.7.  Occupancy of Flight Crew Duty Positions  . 4.7.1.  The PIC will be at a set of flight controls during all critical phases of flight. This does not preclude a seat swap with another AC or IP if such is designated on the Form 4324 Flight Authorization. AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 19 4.7.1.1.  For  missions  with  more  than  two  qualified  and  current  pilots,  squadrons  may designate secondary (double asterisk) PIC on the Flight Authorization. If more than one secondary PIC is designated, the primary PIC will determine who will act as PIC if both secondary PICs are occupying pilot seats at the same time. 4.7.2.  Flight  below  10,000’MSL.  The  AC  will  ensure,  when  able,  that  all  flight  deck  seats are manned to assist in clearing during taxi operations and flight below 10,000 feet MSL. 4.7.3.  Crew  at  Their  Stations.  Crew  members  will  abide  by  AFI  11-202V3,  ACC  Sup regarding  absence  from  their  assigned  duty  station  and  occupying  their  duty  position  seats. During  flight,  if  either  pilot  leaves  the  flight  deck,  a  qualified  FE,  or  an  unqualified  FE supervised by an instructor FE or IP, must remain on headset. 4.8.  Air Refueling (AAR).  ATP-56(B) provides detailed explanations of AAR procedures. 4.8.1.  Copilots  (CPs) are authorized to  fly the aircraft up to  and including pre-contact  with any  AAR  qualified  pilot  in  the  left  seat.  Any  CP  may  conduct  AAR  under  IP  supervision. CPs may AAR under AC supervision provided both are certified and current  IAW AFI 11- 2E-8V1.  Copilots will not perform autopilot off AAR without IP supervision. 4.8.2.  Override  Boom  Latching,  or  Tanker  Manual  Operation  without  tanker  disconnect capability, will not be accomplished unless an actual fuel emergency exists. In the absence of mission operational directives, the OG/CC is the approval authority when a fuel emergency does not exist. 4.8.3.  AAR Rendezvous. The NAV will direct the rendezvous until 1 mile or when the pilots declare  visual  with  the  tanker.  On  P-sorties  without  a  NAV,  the  AC  is  responsible  for accomplishing the rendezvous. 4.8.4.  AAR Overrun. 4.8.4.1.  Crews may  attempt to  prevent  an overrun internally by slowing  to  no less than 275 KIAS. 4.8.4.2.  If the tanker falls below the 45-degree line on the weather radar for RV Delta, and  an  overrun  is  imminent,  the  NAV  will  advise  the  AC.  The  AC  will  conduct  the overrun IAW ATP- 56(B). 4.9.  Landing  Gear  and  Flap  Operations.  Before  actuation  of  the  gear  or  flaps,  the  Pilot Flying (PF) will call for the movement  of the gear or flaps as applicable. The Pilot  Not Flying (PNF) should normally verify appropriate airspeed and acknowledge the command by repeating it. 4.9.1.  The landing gear and flaps should normally be operated by the PNF on command of the PF. 4.10.  Aircraft Lighting. 4.10.1.  Exterior  lighting  will  be  operated  IAW  AFI  11-202V3,  AFI  11-218,  Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, and applicable T.O.s. 4.10.2.  During  combat/contingency  operations,  the  tactical  situation  may  dictate  the  use  of all, some or none of the aircraft exterior lights as determined by the SPINS, FCIF, and/or the 20 AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 AC. Lights-out operations during peacetime will be conducted in warning or restricted areas IAW AFI 11-202V3 unless a letter of agreement exists with the FAA. 4.10.3.  Aircraft  Interior  Lighting.  During  night  parking,  use  of  the  overhead  flight  deck lighting should be avoided until after the aircraft is chocked. 4.11.  Advisory  Calls.  These  calls  will  be  made  when  instrument  procedures  are  being  flown. Advisory calls confirm time critical information between the PNF and the PF. Strict adherence to advisory  calls  with  in-depth  pre-flight  planning  and  a  detailed  approach  briefing  during  low visibility  weather  conditions  greatly  enhances  crew  situational  awareness.  In  addition  to  the required advisory calls depicted in Table 4.1 and Table 4.2, the PF will acknowledge all flight parameter deviations as advised by the PNF. The NAV will back up the PNF and make advisory calls when necessary. Table 4.1.  Non-precision Approaches.

If the runway environment as defined in Air Force Manual 11-217V1 is in sight the PNF will provide a brief description of visual cues.  (i.e. “rabbit lights”, “red termination bars”, “threshold lights”, “runway”, etc.) 2.  PF will announce his/her intentions.  Intentions will be either to land, continue, or go-around.  Decision to continue or land will be IAW procedures outlined in Air Force Manual 11-217V1.  Above DH or prior to the VDP, no response is required unless PF has runway in sight. 3.  PF will announce his/her intentions.  Intentions will be either to land or go-around.  The decision  to land from this position will be IAW procedures outlined in Air Force Manual 11-217V1 and PF  should use extreme caution. 21  4.11.1.  Any  flight  crewmember  seeing  a  200  feet  deviation  in  altitude,  +15/-5  knots  in airspeed or a potential terrain/obstruction hazard, will immediately notify the PF. Deviations from prescribed procedures for the approach being flown will also be announced. 4.11.2.  The  NAV  will  announce  the  minimum  ground  speed  and  monitor  the  FMS  ground speed throughout the approach. 4.11.3.  The Flight Engineer will callout 100’, 50’ and 20’ using the pilot’s radio altimeter for all  landings.  Any  deviation  from  these  elevation  calls  will  be  briefed  during  the  approach briefing. 4.12.  Radio  Discipline.  There  is  no  confidentiality  regarding  aircraft  crew  communications, recorded  or  otherwise.  Crewmembers  are  expected  to  maintain  a  high  degree  of  cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times. 4.12.1.  Sterile  Cockpit.  Limit  conversation  to  that  essential  for  crew  coordination  and mission  accomplishment  during  taxi,  takeoff,  A/R,  approach,  landing,  and  any  flight  below 10,000 feet MSL. 4.12.2.  Aircraft  Interphone.  Flight  deck  crewmembers  will  monitor  the  flight  deck interphone  (FLT  net)  during  all  phases  of  flight.  One  flight  crew  member  will  monitor primary mission crew interphone during critical phases of flight. Navigators should monitor Net 8 and the FE should monitor the IMT. All crew members should monitor the IMT/MX net to the maximum extent possible. 4.12.3.  Command Radios. 4.12.3.1.  The PNF normally makes all ATC radio calls. 4.12.3.2.  In  terminal  areas,  all  flight  crewmembers  should  monitor  the  primary  radio unless  directed  otherwise.  The  PIC  will  designate  crewmembers  to  monitor  other  C2 frequencies as required 4.12.3.3.  The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary, and update the crew when the primary radio changes. 4.12.3.4.  Flight crew will monitor emergency frequencies IAW AFI 11-202V3. 4.12.3.5.  Use secure and jam resistant communications to the maximum extent possible in  a  threat  environment  and  limit  radio  transmissions  within  the  objective  area  to  those required for safety of flight or factors affecting force employment. 22 AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 4.12.3.6.  HF Communications. Confine message traffic to  essential operational matters. Perform an HF radio ground check before takeoff if the use of HF radio may be required for ATC or C2 communications. Establish HF contact before going out of UHF and VHF range. If unable to establish HF contact with the controlling HF station, and an alternate means of relay of ATC information in oceanic areas is not available, comply with FLIP. 4.12.3.7.  Air Refueling. 4.12.3.7.1.  Prior  to  one  mile,  the  NAV  is  normally  primary  on  the  AAR  radio  and pilots primary on ATC.  Guard slice may be removed from the AAR radio. 4.12.3.7.2.  At one mile, pilots normally take control of the AAR radio. 4.12.3.7.3.  Post AAR: Radios and Nets back to normal cruise/on-station settings. 4.13.  In-Flight Briefings.  Takeoff, air refueling, descent, approach, touch-and-go, and full stop briefings will be IAW the T.O. 1E-8C-1, AFMAN 11-217 V1 and AFI 11-202V3. 4.14.  Aircraft Taxi, Obstruction Clearance Criteria  . 4.14.1.  Do  not  taxi  an  aircraft  within  25  feet  of  obstructions  without  wing  walkers monitoring  clearance  between  aircraft  and  obstructions.  With  wing  walkers,  avoid  taxi obstructions  by  at  least  10  feet.  EXCEPTION:  IAW  AFI  11-218,  aircraft  may  taxi  without marshallers/wing walkers at home station along fixed taxi lines in parking lanes which have been  measured  to  ensure  a  minimum  of  10  feet  clearance  from  permanent  obstructions. Aerospace  Ground  Equipment  and  vehicles  are  considered  permanent  obstructions  when parked  in  designated  areas.  Parked  aircraft  are  not  considered  permanent,  and  25  feet  of clearance, or a wing walker, is required. The exception does not apply to obstructions within 25 feet while taxiing outside of parking. 4.15.  Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Avoidance.  Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD. Crews should: 4.15.1.  Carefully  review  airfield  layout  paying  particular  attention  to  taxi  routes,  turn requirements,  and  areas  for  potential  FOD.  Pay  attention  to  other  aircraft  with  engines running on parking aprons, adjacent taxiways, hammerheads, and arm/de-arm areas. 4.15.2.  Minimize power settings during all taxi operations. 4.15.3.  Avoid (when possible) 180-degree turns. 4.15.4.  Avoid  (when  possible)  taxi  operations,  which  would  position  an  engine  over  an unprepared  or  un-swept  surface.  If  it  becomes  necessary  to  position  an  engine  over  an unprepared  or  un-swept  surface,  the  engine  should  be  left  in  idle  (to  the  maximum  extent possible) until the engine is back over an improved surface. 4.16.  JTIDS  Altitude  De-confliction.  Errors of up to 2000 feet can exist between the altitude reported on JTIDS and the altitude reported by IFF. Crews must use extreme caution when using JTIDS tracks for traffic avoidance. 4.17.  Traffic  Alert  and  Collision  System  (TCAS).  It  is  imperative  to  follow  resolution advisories  (RAs)  to  obtain  the  aircraft  separation  computed  by  TCAS.  Failure  to  follow  the computed RA may increase the probability of a midair collision. AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 23 4.18.  Radio  Altimeter.  Set  the  radio  altimeter  dependent  upon  the  phase  of  flight.  For instrument approaches, set DH or MDA as applicable. Set 2,500 for en-route cruise per T.O. 1E-8C-1.  Any  crewmember  detecting  an  unanticipated  radio  altimeter  annunciator  light  will immediately notify the pilot flying. Terrain clearance and aircraft position must be verified. An immediate climb is warranted if uncertainty exists. 4.19.  Ground  Proximity  Warning  System  (GPWS).  While  flying  instrument  approaches, follow T.O. 1E-8C-1 guidance regarding GPWS alerts. All other GPWS alerts will be handled as follows: 4.19.1.  For operations in day VMC conditions, with terrain and obstacles clearly in sight, the PF will call runway and/or terrain in sight, state intentions and visually clear terrain. 4.19.2.  For  operations  at  night  or  in  IMC,  if  the  aircraft  position  cannot  be  verified, immediately  and  simultaneously  establish  a  climb  while  rolling  wings  level,  and  add maximum  power  until  the  “terrain”  warning  has  ceased  and  adequate  terrain  clearance  is verified. Do not delay pull-up for diagnosis of the low altitude warning. Failure to roll wings level  during  the  maneuver  described  above  will  decrease  stall  margin  and  climb  rates  at heavy aircraft gross weights. 4.20.  Formation.  The E-8 is authorized to fly the following formation procedures: 4.20.1.  AAR formation as described in ATP-56 and T.O. 1E-8C-1. 4.20.2.  As required to accomplish assigned special missions. 4.21.  Aircraft  Speed.  ACs  may  only  exceed  250  KIAS  below  10,000MSL  during  CONUS sorties  while  complying  with  the  restrictions  set  forth  in  AFI  11-202V3.  When  operating OCONUS, ACs will not exceed the speed authorizations of a foreign country unless required for defensive procedures. If 250 KIAS is exceeded below 10,000MSL for any reason, consideration will be given to increased bird strike hazard. 4.22.  Navigation. 4.22.1.  Inertial  Navigation  Unit  (INU).  The  Gyro  Compass  alignment  is  the  preferred method of alignment for continuation training missions unless time and conditions permit an Enhanced Interrupted Alignment (EIA) on one or more INUs. 4.22.1.1.  EIA is an optional method of INU alignment for operational missions. A strong understanding  of  the  limitations  and  benefits  of  EIA  is  recommended  before  using  this method. 4.22.1.2.  Only  one  INU  will  be  used  for  air  alignment  training.  The  other  INU  will  be available for navigation. 4.22.2.  Oceanic  Crossings.  Trans-Oceanic  crews  will  obtain  current  Atlantic/Pacific  Route messages  prior  to  flight.  Deployment  Planning  Cell  (DPC)  personnel  may  assist  with planning deploying/redeploying OCONUS sorties. Crews should be familiar with appropriate country over flight requirements such as diplomatic clearances, ICAO radio procedures, etc. 4.22.2.1.  The navigator is responsible to ensure an equal time point (ETP) is calculated between each in-flight refueling and the destination for oceanic crossings. The ETP is a point  along  the  route  at  which  the  aircraft  may  either  proceed  to  the  destination,  first 24 AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 suitable  airport,  return  to  departure  base  or  last  suitable  airport  in  the  same  amount  of time based on all engines operating. 4.22.3.  Due Regard. ACs should be familiar with the concept of due regard and be prepared to declare such if necessary. Due regard is defined as operational situations that do not lend themselves  to  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  flight  procedures,  such  as military contingencies,  classified missions, politically  sensitive missions, or certain  training activities.  Flight  under  “Due  Regard”  obligates  the  military  PIC  to  be  his  or  her  own  air traffic control (ATC) agency and to separate his or her aircraft from all other air traffic. See FLIP GP, Chapter 8 and AFI 11-202V3. 4.22.4.  Charts and Data. 4.22.4.1.  Navigational  charts  will  be  annotated  IAW  AFI  11-202V3,  MAJCOM  and local Supplements and T.O. 1E-8C-1. 4.22.4.2.  If an appropriate FLIP document is not available, NAVs will use a terrain chart to  monitor  the  aircraft  position  and  ensure  terrain  clearance  during  departures  and arrivals.  The  terrain  chart  should  be  an  ONC  or  larger  scale  chart  and  available  at  the NAV  station.  Crews  will  not  use  terrain  charts  to  build  their  own  obstacle  clearance departures. 4.22.4.3.  Crews  should  ensure  the  PCMCIA  data  card  is  current  for  every  flight. PCMCIA  cards  will  be  removed  prior  to  any  mission  system  being  zeroized  to  prevent inadvertently  deleting  the  data.    If  the  data  card  is  not  current,  the  flight  may  continue provided  all  waypoint  coordinates  are  cross-referenced  to  current  FLIP  products  or JMPS/CFPS products that were prepared using current DAFIF. 4.22.5.  Position  checks  will  be  made  as  required  to  comply  with  RNP  and  RNAV requirements listed below. 4.22.6.  The NAV will track all in-flight  clearances and maintain a flight  log  IAW AFI 11-202V3, MAJCOM Sup. 4.22.7.  Area Navigation (RNAV), Required Navigational Performance (RNP), and Reduced Vertical  Separation  Minimum  (RVSM)  Airspace.  All  E-8s  are  certified  to  operate  in  the following airspaces: BRNAV/RNAV 5, RNP 10/RNAV 10 and RVSM. 4.22.7.1.  RNP 10 is the legacy name for what is more accurately described as RNAV 10.  The ICAO has determined renaming all associated documentation to be cost-prohibitive, so all charting annotations will continue to be depicted as RNP 10.  True RNP airspace requires on-board performance monitoring and alerting, which the E-8 does not require.  ACC and the System Program Office have determined the E-8 navigation system meets the  applicable  civil  performance  standards  of  RNAV  10  when  operated  under  the direction of this regulation. 4.22.7.2.  Basic RNAV (BRNAV) is synonymous with RNAV 5. 4.22.7.3.  When operating in RNP 10 or BRNAV airspace, INU-only must be used as the primary navigation solution. The INU-only solution cannot be used longer than 7.5 hours from the time the INUs were commanded to the NAV mode or the last update, whichever is later. Refer to RNP 10/BRNAV Update and Contingency Procedures in this volume. AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 25 4.22.8.  RNP  10/BRNAV  Flight  Planning.  The  PIC  will  review  airspace  requirements  (i.e. specific RNP  level  and  contingency  actions, etc), verify the  aircraft  equipment  required for RNP 10/BRNAV is operational, and assess mission impact when flying in RNP 10/BRNAV airspace. 4.22.8.1.  Mission  Planning.  Crews  will  check  the  appropriate  NOTAM  and  FLIP products  to  determine  airspace  and  filing  requirements.  Crews  will  plan  appropriate update  points  along  the  route  of  flight  to  extend  the  RNP  10/BRNAV  time  limit  for  an additional 7.5 hours. 4.22.8.2.  En-route.  Both  INUs  must  be  operational  at  the  RNP-10  or  BRNAV  entry point.  Periodic  crosschecks  will  be  accomplished  to  identify  navigation  errors  and prevent inadvertent deviation from ATC cleared routes. Advise ATC of the deterioration or  failure  of  navigation  equipment  below  navigation  performance  requirements  and coordinate appropriate actions. 4.22.9.  RNP  10/RNAV  10  Airspace  Operations.  RNP  10  compliance  includes  navigation accuracy within 10 NM of actual position 95 percent of the time. The E-8C may operate in RNP 10 airspace when the following conditions are met: 4.22.9.1.  The  INU-only  navigation  mode  is  selected  for  the  primary  steering  solution. Other navigation modes may not be used for operations in RNP 10 airspace. 4.22.9.2.  Updates will be IAW RNP 10/BRNAV update and contingency procedures in this volume. 4.22.10.  BRNAV/RNAV  5  Airspace  Operations.  Compliance  includes  navigation  accuracy within  5NM  of  actual  position  95  percent  of  the  time.  The  E-8C  may  operate  in  BRNAV airspace when the following conditions are met: 4.22.10.1.  The  INU-only  navigation  mode  is  selected  for  the  primary  steering  solution. Other navigation modes may not be used for operations in BRNAV airspace. 4.22.10.2.  Updates will be IAW RNP 10/BRNAV update and contingency procedures in this volume. 4.22.10.3.  Updates  will  be  IAW  RNP/BRNAV  update  and  contingency  procedures  in this volume. 4.22.11.  RNP 10 4.22.11.1.  Crews  will  update  both  INU’s  while  in  ground  NAVAID  coverage  prior  to oceanic crossing to re-hack the 7.5 hour RNP 10/BRNAV time limit. Aircraft must exit RNP  10/BRNAV  airspace  7.5  hours  after  the  INU  systems  were  placed  in  NAV  mode after either a full gyrocompass ground alignment or an in-flight update. 4.22.11.2.  An  in-flight  update  may  only  be  conducted  on  one  INU  at  a  time  within coverage of an FAA/CAA approved radio-NAVAID. 4.22.11.3.  The  resulting  update  must  provide  a  position  that  agrees  with  the  position provided by the radio-NAVAID plus or minus 0.3 NM. 26 AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 4.22.11.4.  After the first INU successfully completes an in-flight update and its position accuracy  is  verified,  the  second  INU  may  be  updated  and  its  position  compared  to  the first INU, or the radio-NAVAID. 4.22.11.5.  Another  update  will  occur  when  within  ground  NAVAID  coverage  after oceanic crossing. Additionally, update the INU before the position drifts five miles from the actual position. 4.22.11.6.  Contingencies.  Crews  will  notify  ATC  any  time  the  instruments  required  in the  MEL  for  RNP  10/BRNAV  airspace  are  lost,  and  coordinate  a  new  clearance  if required 4.22.12.  Post  Flight.  Document  malfunctions  or  failures  of  RNP/BRNAV  required equipment,  including  the  failure  of  this  equipment  to  meet  RNP/BRNAV  tolerances,  in  an AFTO Form 781. 4.22.13.  Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM is  applied  is  considered  special  qualification  airspace.  Both  the  aircrew  and  the  specific aircraft  must  be  approved  for  operations  in  these  areas.  IRC  currency  establishes  IRC certification for E-8C aircrew. All E-8’s are approved for unrestricted use in the full RVSM envelope.  Refer to FLIP GP and the following guidance for RVSM requirements: 4.22.14.  RVSM  Equipment.  Primary  altimeters,  the  autopilot  (to  include  the  altitude  hold function), the altitude alerter, and the IFF transponder must be fully operational before entry into  RVSM  airspace.  Should  any  of  this  equipment  fail  before  entering  RVSM  airspace, request a new clearance so as to avoid this airspace. 4.22.14.1.  Autopilot.  The  autopilot  shall  be  engaged  during  level  cruise  except  when circumstances  such  as  the  need  to  re-trim  the  aircraft  or  turbulence  procedures  require disengagement. 4.22.14.2.  Altimeters.  Crosscheck to  RESET)  before  or immediately  upon  entry  to  RVSM  airspace.  The  PIC  will  ensure  that  readings  of  all altimeters are recorded and retained for use in contingency situations. the  altimeters  (STBY 4.22.14.3.  Should  any  of  the  required  equipment  fail  after  entry  into  RVSM  airspace, immediately notify ATC and coordinate a plan of action. 4.22.15.  RVSM  Operations.  Continuously  monitor  systems  and  crosscheck  altimeters  to ensure they  agree  ± 200 ft. Aircrews should limit  climb  and descent  rates to  1,000 feet  per minute when operating in  the vicinity of other aircraft to  reduce potential  effects  on TCAS operations. 4.22.16.  Post Flight. Document malfunctions or failures of RVSM required equipment in the AFTO Form 781, including the failure of equipment to meet RVSM tolerances. 4.23.  Bird/Wildlife  Aircraft  Strike  Hazard  (BASH)  Programs.  BASH  programs  are centralized  base  efforts  that  provide  information  cross-feed,  hazard  identification,  and  a consolidated course of action. BASH programs are developed and executed by host base Safety and  Bio-environmental  offices  and  approved  by  host  base  commanders.  Some  airfields,  i.e. Army, do not have BASH programs and will not set a Bird Watch Condition  (BWC), requiring crews to use all available resources to determine local bird conditions AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 27 4.23.1.  Mission  Planning:  ACs  will  reference  the  Avian  Hazard  Advisory  System  (AHAS) website  (http://www.usahas.com)  within  24  hours  of  mission  execution  to  determine forecast bird strike potential at takeoff, transition and landing bases for ORM purposes. 4.23.2.  Flight:  The  AC  will  obtain  the  airfield’s  actual  BWC  from  ATIS,  tower,  SOF, airfield operations or pilot assessment. Crews may request an AHAS update within an hour of  proposed  takeoff  or  landing  via  C2  agencies  to  get  live  data  with  trend  information. Aircrews will comply with the following restrictions: 4.23.2.1.  BWC Low – No operating restrictions. 4.23.2.2.  BWC  Moderate.  Initial  takeoffs  and  final  landings  are  authorized  only  if  the departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Flight crews should consult with the SOF prior to landing or departing. Continuation training is restricted to low approaches at or above 2,000 AGL.  VFR traffic patterns and IFR circling approaches are prohibited. 4.23.2.3.  BWC Severe (BWCS). All takeoffs and landings are prohibited IAW AFI 11-202V3. Waiver authority for non-emergency landing is local OG/CC or SOF. 4.23.2.4.  If the SOF authorizes a waiver for a full stop, the AC will fly an ILS or a visual approach  using  the  best  available  glide  path  guidance.  If  a  non-precision  approach  is required due to the inability to fly an ILS or visual approach, the AC will limit the time spent flying at or below MDA by planning a constant rate descent to arrive at the MDA at, or just prior to, the VDP. If a circling approach is required, the AC will fly the circling maneuver at the highest possible altitude up to VFR pattern altitude and limit time spent flying at the circling MDA. 4.23.2.5.  The AC is the final authority regarding the conduct of a full stop landing during bird  watch  condition  severe  if  the  recovery  is  necessitated  by  an  in-flight  emergency. Time  permitting,  the  SOF  should  provide  an  advisory  call  to  the  emergency  aircraft regarding the actual bird conditions being observed at the airfield. 4.23.2.6.  All  waivers  for  a  full  stop  landing  at  Robins  AFB  during  BWCS  will  be documented in the daily SOF log. 4.23.3.  ACs  are  the  final  authority  and  may  delay  takeoffs  and  arrivals  due  to  BWC. Coordinate delays through appropriate C2 authority. 4.23.4.  Following  a  bird/wildlife  strike,  pilots  should  land  as  soon  as  practical  for maintenance  evaluation  or  if  at  an  outbase,  a  visual  inspection  by  the  PIC.    If  there  is  no damage to the aircraft, the PIC may elect to continue the mission.  After mission completion, record the bird strike in the AFTO 781 and complete and turn in to maintenance debrief both sides of 116 ACW Form 5. If the landing is off station, turn in the Form 5 to the local Safety office (if available) and maintenance debrief /116 ACW Safety office upon return to Robins. 4.24.  Functional  Check  Flights  (FCFs)  and  Operational  Check  Flights  (OCFs).  FCFs and OCFs  will  be  accomplished  IAW  AFI  21-101,  Aircraft  and  Equipment  Maintenance Management, and the OG supplement. 4.24.1.  Requirements. An OCF is designed to check mission equipment/software builds and will be performed upon request, normally when: 4.24.1.1.  Aircraft are returned following depot modifications and/or C checks. 28 AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 4.24.1.2.  The first flight after a software release. 4.24.1.3.  The  116  AMXS  determines  an  OCF  should  be  performed  due  to  extensive Primary Mission Equipment (PME) maintenance. 4.24.2.  Scheduling.  Specific scheduling responsibilities are as follows: 4.24.2.1.  The requestor of the OCF (normally ACNS/F, MXS, or XP) will develop and provide  an  OCF  checklist.    The  requestor  will  deliver  the  OCF  checklist  to  OSS schedulers during the applicable scheduling meeting and to OGV for awareness. 4.24.2.2.  ACNS/F,  Det  2  and/or  Northrop  Grumman  will  supply  OSS  the  full  name, rank,  social  security  number  and  security  clearance  information  on  non-116  ACW personnel requesting to fly on the OCF sortie. 4.24.3.  Crew Manning. The SQ/DO will determine the crew manning as required. The MCC is  responsible  for  acquiring  the  applicable  OCF  checklist  from  the  SQ/DO.  The  MCC  will ensure all necessary checklists are completed, and write an OCF report. 4.24.4.  Software OCF. ACNS/F will provide information to the SQ/DO or MCC on specific Deficiency  Reports  (DR)  included  in  the  new  software  version.  The  MCC  will  ensure  the corrections for these DRs are tested for operational suitability. Some can be verified during ground  test,  but  others  will  require  flight  test.  The  OCF  report  will  specifically  list  passed and failed Discrepancy Reports (DRs) along with reasons for any failures. 4.24.5.  Reports. Crewmembers will provide all relevant findings to the MCC. After an OCF is  completed,  the  MCC  will  send  an  after  action  report  to  OGV  and  MXG/QA.  OGV  will forward discrepancies to OG/CC. 4.25.  Participation  in  Aerial  Events.  See  AFI  11-209,  Aerial  Event  Policy  and  Procedures, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplements. Aerial events must be sanctioned and approved by the appropriate military authority and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 4.26.  Aircraft  Security.  The  E-8  is  designated  a  security  priority  Protection  Level  2,  or equivalent  resource.  The  AC  is  responsible  for  ensuring  aircraft  security  is  provided  at  the destination  and  any  en-route  stops.  Guidance  can  be  found  on  aircraft  security  and  preventing and resisting aircraft piracy (hijacking) of E-8 aircraft in AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft  Piracy  (Hijacking),  AFI  31-101,  The  Air  Force  Installation  Security  Program,  FAA NOTICE 7110.422 and other specific MAJCOM security publications. Aircrews will not release information concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public. 4.27.  Suspected  Laser  Response/  Exposure.  Aircrews  should  recognize  the  laser  may  be associated with a weapon posing a greater threat and initiate appropriate evasive action. If a laser threat  exists  in  vicinity  of  an  airfield  of  intended  arrival  or  departure,  Aircrew  Laser  Eye Protection  (ALEP)  devices  should  be  donned  prior  to  descent  from  cruise  altitude,  or  prior  to takeoff,  as  applicable.  Doffing  of  ALEP  devices  after  departing  a  defined  laser  threat  area  or after landing is left to discretion of the aircraft commander. The following procedures should be implemented immediately following suspected laser exposure. 4.27.1.  Look away from laser source; do not remove ALEP devices. 4.27.2.  Transition to aircraft instruments and turn away from the threat. AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 29 4.27.3.  If exposed pilot is flying the aircraft, transfer control to unaffected pilot. 4.27.4.  Assess  visual functionality.  If visual disturbance persists for more than 60 seconds, declare in-flight emergency and return to base as soon as practical. 4.27.5.  Notify command and control agency of suspected laser incident. 4.27.6.  Avoid rubbing eyes. 4.27.7.  If  vision  returns  to  normal  and  there  is  no  pain  within  3-5  minutes,  the  AC  will consider the value of continuing the mission against potential loss of an aircrew member who may have sustained eye damage. The AC will determine whether or not to return to base. 4.27.8.  Upon  return  to  base,  accomplish  intelligence  debrief  and  report  suspected  laser exposure  incidents  IAW  procedures  outlined  in  AFI  11-301  Volume  4,  Aircrew  Laser  Eye Protection (ALEP). 4.27.9.  Aircrew  who  suspect  exposure  to  laser  radiation  from  either  friendly  or  hostile sources should report to Flight Surgeon’s Office or nearest emergency room where they can be examined by an ophthalmologist immediately upon landing. 4.27.10.  For  continued  flight  in  areas  of  known  or  suspected  lasing  activity,  crews  should obtain ALEP from Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE).  Pilots will use Block 0+ if available.  Other crewmembers with window access and scanning duties may use Block 0 or Block 0+ if available. 4.28.  Use  of  Bose  Headsets  .  The  Bose  ANR  Aviation  X  headset,  model  #AHX-32-02,  has been tested under Field Service Engineering Report (FSER) 05-0252 and is approved for use on the E-8C.  Bose ANR Aviation X headset models #AHX-34 and AHX-36 are not compatible and are not approved for use on the E-8C. 4.28.1.  The  AHX  32-02  is  not  compatible  with  the  MBU-13P  Aircrew  Chem  Mask.

General.  Potential adversary use of CBRNE weapons against a friendly airfield presents a serious  threat  to  flying  operations.  Although  the  most  effective  way  for  aircrews  to  avoid  this threat is to be airborne before those weapons are detonated or dispersed and then land at a field that has not been contaminated, all personnel must be prepared to operate from  a field that has come under CBRNE attack. 6.2.  Mission  Preparation.  Be  aware  of  the  status  of  the  CBRNE  environment  at  the  planned launch and recovery airfields, potential divert bases, and throughout the area in which the sortie may fly. Know the current and forecast surface wind direction and the MOPP level in effect for relevant sectors of the airfield. Don appropriate aircrew chemical defense equipment (ACDE) or Ground  Crew  Ensemble  (GCE)  to  match  the  appropriate  MOPP  level  (reference  AFMAN  10- 100, Airman’s Manual) and carry individual protective equipment (IPE) as required. 6.3.  Stepping  to  Fly  and  Aircraft  Preflight.  This may entail donning ACDE or transitioning from GCE to ACDE. Take precautions to protect aircrew from injury and or contamination while in transit from the squadron facility to the aircraft. If possible, transport aircrew in a vehicle that provides  overhead  cover  (enclosed  vehicle).  If  aircrew  travel  on  foot  is  unavoidable,  choose  a route that takes maximum advantage of available overhead cover (sun shades, buildings, etc.) to avoid  agents  that  may  be  settling  from  the  air.  If  extra  aircrew  members  are  available  for preflight  duties,  consider  assigning  them  to  do  so  wearing  GCE.  This  will  allow  the  aircrew actually flying to minimize exposure. 6.3.1.  Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) Prior to Engine Start. If Alarm Red occurs during the step or preflight process, take cover and don appropriate MOPP. This may require use of the  ground  crew  mask.  A  hardened  aircraft  shelter  (HAS)  provides  optimum  protection,  if available. Use caution if entering a HAS that contains aircraft and/or equipment. Close doors after  entry.  If  a  HAS  or  other  overhead  cover  is  not  immediately  available,  accept  the  best rapidly reachable cover. 6.4.  Engine  Start  to  Takeoff.  If  a  HAS  is  available,  use  it  to  minimize  exposure  time  by accomplishing  aircraft  pre-flight  and  engine  start  procedures  inside  it  (if    local    procedures permit) and by delaying taxi time as long as possible prior to takeoff. 6.4.1.  Aircraft Launch to Survive (LTS). Units will develop local procedures to provide this option  to  the  commander.  In  general,  aircraft  may  LTS  any  time  after  engine  start  if  they have  sufficient  fuel  and  safe,  expeditious  access  to  a  runway.  This  option  may  only  be practical for aircraft that are near EOR prior to takeoff or that have just landed. 6.4.2.  Alarm Red Prior to Taxi. If in a HAS, the normal procedure is to shut down. Engine noise  may  preclude  effectiveness  of  normal  alert  notification  procedures,  so  ensure  ground personnel are aware of the alarm warning, assume proper MOPP, and close HAS doors. Use hand signals if necessary. 6.4.3.  Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) After Taxi. Units typically establish procedures for this contingency depending on whether additional protection is available along the taxi route 34 AFI11-2E-8V3  31 AUGUST 2017 (empty HAS, for instance). Ideally, ground crew sheltering in such a HAS would be available to assist in normal engine shutdown procedures and to close HAS doors. If protection is not available,  the  best  option  may  be  LTS.  Maintain  contact  with  Command  and  Control  (C2) entities (Wing Operations Center, Maintenance Operations Center, Supervisor of Flying, etc.) to ensure unity of effort in the overall plan. 6.5.  Takeoff to Landing. 6.5.1.  Contamination. If Chemical Warfare (CW) agent contamination has occurred prior to takeoff, then flying the aircraft will dissipate the agent to some degree. The total amount of dissipation  will  be  greater  with  lower  flight  altitudes  and  longer  flight  times.  Because  the agent  may have  entered  wheel  wells, flaps,  etc.,  consider flying in  landing  configuration to increase airflow to these areas. In any circumstances, merely flying the aircraft is unlikely to achieve complete decontamination. 6.5.2.  Preparing  to  Land.  Aircrew  should  remain  aware  of  the  status  of    primary    and alternate landing locations. Do not attempt to land during Alarm Red situations unless there is no other option. Follow C2 directions and either hold or divert. If mission needs preclude divert,  hold  until  the  Alarm  Red  (or  theater  equivalent)  has  cleared  or  become  an  Alarm Black.  Prior  to  landing,  gain  awareness  of  contaminated  sectors  of  the  airfield  and  of current/forecast surface winds.  Use this information in conjunction with C2 direction to plan a  route  from  landing  to  engine  shutdown.  The  liquid  deposition  phase  following  a  CW airburst attack can extend up to 1 hour. If landing during Alarm Black, expect a contaminated environment and MOPP 4. 6.6.  Landing  to  Engine  Shutdown.  Take  advantage  of  any  protection  available,  minimizing taxi  time  and  distance.  Maintain  contact  with  C2  in  order  to  remain  aware  of  unexploded ordnance  and/or  damage  to  airfield  movement  surfaces.  If  a  HAS  is  available  and  local procedures permit, accomplish engine shut-down and post-flight procedures there. If Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) occurs between landing and engine shutdown, considerations are similar to those discussed in the engine-start-to-takeoff section. 6.7.  After  Engine  Shutdown.  Don  appropriate  MOPP  if  not  already  worn.  If  circumstances permit, accomplish normal post-flight inspection procedures. If the aircraft is not contaminated, close doors, hatches, and windows. If there is any suspicion of personnel contamination, aircrew will  process  through  an  aircrew  contamination  control  area  (ACCA).  Accomplish  maintenance debriefings under cover to the maximum extent possible.  MARK C.
