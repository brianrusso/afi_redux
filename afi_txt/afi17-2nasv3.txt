MAJCOM/A3TB  uses  the  unit’s  last  programmed  ASD  when  initially  determining execution/flying  hour’s  programs  for  the  current  and  future  years.  Units  will  update  ASD annually  to  reflect  the  unit’s  best  estimate  of  the  optimum  sortie  duration  after  considering historical  experiences, changes in  missions, deployments, etc. The formula to  calculate ASD is ASD = # of weapon system hours employed divided by number of sorties. Basic Mission Capable (BMC)—The status of a crew member who has satisfactorily completed IQT and MQT to  perform  the unit’s basic operational missions, but  does not  maintain Mission Ready (MR)/CMR status. Crew member accomplishes training required to remain familiarized in all and may be qualified and proficient in some of the primary missions of their weapon system BMC requirements. These crew members may also maintain special mission qualification. Campaign—A  series  of  related  major  operations  aimed  at  achieving  strategic  and  operational objectives within a given time and space. Certification—Designation  of  an  individual  by  the  certifying  official  as  having  completed required training and/or evaluation and being capable of performing a specific duty. Combat  Mission  Ready  (CMR)—A  crew  member  who  has  satisfactorily  completed  IQT  and MQT,  and  maintains  certification,  currency  and  proficiency  in  the  command  or  unit  combat mission. Continuation  Training  (CT)—Training  which  provides  crew  members  with  the  volume, frequency,  and  mix  of  training  necessary  to  maintain  currency  and  proficiency  in  the  assigned qualification level. Crew Commander (CCC)—Serves as the command authority for NAS operations and provides command oversight  for operations floor personnel as well as enforcing policies and procedures to ensure successful mission accomplishment. Crew  Information  File  (CIF)—A  collection  of  publications  and  material  determined  by  the MAJCOM and unit as necessary for day-to-day operations. Crew Position Indicator (CPI)—Codes used to manage crew positions to ensure a high state of readiness is maintained with available resources. Crew—The personnel and positions necessary to conduct cyberspace sorties. A NAS crew must be composed of the minimum required personnel defined in this document. Crew  member—Individuals  who  conduct  cyberspace  operations  or  computer  network exploitation and are typically assigned to a specific weapon system. Currency—A  measure  of  how  frequently  and/or  recently  a  task  is  completed.  Currency requirements should ensure the average crew member maintains a minimum level of proficiency in a given event. Cyber (adj.)—Of or pertaining to the cyberspace environment, capabilities, plans, or operations. Cyberspace Operations  (CO)—The employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace.   18 AFI17-2NASV3  10 FEBRUARY 2017 Cyberspace—A  global  domain  within  the  information  environment  consisting  of  the interdependent  network  of  information  technology  infrastructures  and  resident  data,  including the  Internet,  telecommunications  networks,  computer  systems,  and  embedded  processors  and controllers. Cyberspace Crew Commander-Attack (CCC-A)—Serves as the command authority for NAS crew  operations  and  is  responsible  for  execution  and  monitoring  of  all  operations  and  is  the unit’s focal point for mission tasking from the tasking authority. The CCC is responsible for the review, approval and execution of all operations under his/her purview.

Deviation—Performing  action(s)  not  in  sequence  with  current  procedures,  directives,  or regulations. Performing action(s) out of sequence due to unusual or extenuating circumstances is not  considered  a  deviation.  In  some  cases,  momentary  deviations  may  be  acceptable;  however, cumulative deviations will be considered in determining the overall qualification level. Event—An item that occurs or is encountered that initiates a process requiring a set of tasks to be accomplished. Multiple events may be completed and logged during a sortie (be it operational sortie or a training sortie) unless specifically excluded elsewhere in this instruction. Instructor—An  experienced  individual  qualified  to  instruct  other  individuals  in  mission  area academics  and  positional  duties.

Mission  Ready—A  crew  member  who  has  satisfactorily  completed  IQT  and  MQT,  and maintains certification, currency and proficiency in the command or unit operational mission. Mission  Window—This is  a window of opportunity and direction for  a tactical  commander to conduct  operations.  A  Mission  Window  is  bounded  (start  by/finish  by)  to  give  a  tactical commander  the  authorized  and  suspense  timing  available  to  plan  and  prosecute  mission. Deviations from the assigned Mission Window will be approved by the tasking authority. Qualification—Designation  of  an  individual  by  the  unit  commander  as  having  completed required training and evaluation and being capable of performing a specific duty. Ready  Cybercrew  Program  (RCP)—RCP  is  the  formal  continuation  training  (CT)  program that provides the baseline for squadrons to use in developing a realistic training program to meet all  DOC  statement  tasked  requirements  as  well  as  specific  NAF  mission  prioritization.  RCP defines  the  minimum  required  mix  of  annual  sorties,  simulator  missions,  and  training  events AFI17-2NASV3  10 FEBRUARY 2017 19 crew  members  must  accomplish  to  sustain  mission  readiness.  These  programs  have  clearly defined  objectives  and  minimum  standard  that  enhance  mission  accomplishment  and  safety.  RCP  sorties  are  tracked.  In  order  to  be  effective,  each  mission  must  successfully  complete  a sufficient  number  of  events  applicable  to  that  mission  type,  as  determined  by  the  squadron commander.
