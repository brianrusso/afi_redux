CCAF is one of several federally chartered degree-granting institutions; however, it is the only 2-year institution exclusively serving military enlisted personnel. The college is regionally accredited through Air University by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) to award AAS degrees designed for specific Air Force occupational specialties and is the largest multi-campus community college in the world. Upon completion of basic military training and assignment to an AF career field, all enlisted personnel are registered in a CCAF degree program and are afforded the opportunity to obtain an Associate in Applied Science degree. In order to be awarded, degree requirements must be successfully completed before the student separates from the Air Force, retires, or is commissioned as an officer. See the CCAF website for details regarding the AAS degree programs at http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/.  B10.1.  CCAF Degree Requirements.  All enlisted airmen are automatically entered into the CCAF program. Prior to completing an associate degree, the 5-level must be awarded and the following requirements must be met:       Semester Hours Technical Education...................................................................................24 Leadership, Management, and Military Studies ..........................................6 Physical Education .......................................................................................4 General Education ....................................................................................15* Program Elective ......................................................................................15* Total:  64   *Note: The Emergency Management degree requires 18 semester hours (SH) of general education (addition of a 3 SH general education elective) and 12 SH of program elective. B10.1.1.  Technical Education  (24 Semester Hours):  Completion of the career field apprentice course satisfies some semester hours of the technical education requirements.  A minimum of 24 semester hours of Technical Core subjects/courses must be applied and the remaining semester hours applied from Technical Core/Technical Elective courses. Some academic degree programs have specific technical education requirements. Refer to the CCAF General Catalog for specific degree requirements for your specialty.  B10.1.2.  Leadership, Management, and Military Studies  (6 Semester Hours):  Enlisted Professional Military Education (EPME) and/or civilian management courses. B10.1.3.  Physical Education (4 Semester Hours):  This requirement is satisfied by completion of Basic Military Training. B10.1.4.  General Education (15 Semester Hours):  Applicable courses must meet the criteria for application of courses to the General Education Requirements (GER) and be in agreement with the definitions of applicable General Education subjects/courses as provided in the CCAF General Catalog.   B10.1.5.  Program Elective (15 Semester Hours):  Satisfied with applicable Technical Education; Leadership, Management, and Military Studies; or General Education subjects/courses, including natural science courses meeting GER application criteria.

(Example:  b and 1b) A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a  subject common to several tasks.  This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.  This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.  (Example “3c/X”).  Lower code (3c/2b) indicates a task trained to a level lower than required.  This triangle symbol indicates a QTP is available for the given task.        This triangle symbol indicates the QTP is under development for the given task.   Specific tasks not identified with a symbol or proficiency code key (blank) indicates no training is provided in the course or CDC.  Major commands and/or units may establish scale values and combat training as dictated by mission requirements.
