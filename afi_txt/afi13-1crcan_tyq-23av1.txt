Complete  a  GEQ  within  6  months  following  completion  of  IQT  IAW ACC/TRSS  Det  9  guidance/policy.    Notify  flight  commander  or  supervisor  and Directorate of Operations Training (DOT) when this GEQ has been completed/submitted. 1.3.  Training.  Operations  training  is  designed  to  progress  crew  members  from  IQT  (Basic Course  or  Requalification  Training)  through  MQT,  to  CT,  as  applicable.    A  qualification  is awarded  to  individuals  upon  the  successful  completion  of  IQT,  MQT,  or  Requalification Training (RQT).  Personnel can be qualified: BQ, BMC, and CMR. 1.3.1.  IQT (Chapter 2).  IQT provides the training needed to qualify for basic crew duties in an  assigned  crew  position  without  regard  to  the  unit’s  mission.    Upon  completion  of  IQT, individuals attain a BQ status. 1.3.1.1.  BQ individuals have completed an evaluation and are qualified to perform basic crew  positional  duties.    The  Squadron  CC  (SQ/CC)  determines  those  missions  that  BQ crew members may perform unsupervised. 1.3.1.1.1.  DRU BQ crew members are fully qualified in the unique mission that their unit performs. 1.3.1.2.  BQ is a prerequisite for MQT. 1.3.1.2.1.  BQ is not a long-term qualification status (except for DRU crew members) and  waiver  authority  to  remain  BQ  resides  with  MAJCOMs  (ACC/A3C,  USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3C for USAFE-AFAFRICA units or PACAF/A3/6C for PACAF units) 1.3.2.  MQT (Chapter 3).  MQT provides crew members the advanced training necessary to qualify  to  perform  the  command  or  unit  mission  in  an  assigned  crew  position.    Crew members  maintain  BQ  status  until  completion  of  MQT.    Upon  completion  of  MQT  and associated  Stan/Eval  requirements,  IAW  AFI13-1  Vol.  2,  individuals  are  designated BMC/CMR.    MQT  is  not  required  for  attached  Wing  personnel  unless  required  by  unit leadership. 1.3.3.  BMC/CMR.    BMC  and  CMR  training  requirements  and  currencies  are  outlined  in Chapter 4 or the RTM. 1.3.3.1.  BMC.  BMC designated crew members have primary jobs or staff functions that directly  support  the  MDS  mission.    BMC  crew  members  will  maintain  familiarization with  all  unit  core  missions.    They  may  also  maintain  proficiency  and  qualification  in some of the unit core missions.  BMC crew members must be able to attain CMR status in 30 days or less. (T-3). 1.3.3.1.1.  BMC  crew  members  may  participate  in  any  mission  for  which  they  are proficient  and  qualified,  without  additional  training,  as  determined  by  the  SQ/CC.  Failure  to  complete  BMC  required  training  results  in  regression  to  non-BMC  (N-BMC) status. 1.3.3.2.  CMR.  CMR  crew  members  maintain  currency  and  proficiency  in  all  core missions of the unit to which they are assigned or attached.  CMR entails accomplishing the  minimum  required  training  requirements  for  crew  members  to  be  qualified  and proficient in all of the primary missions tasked for their duty position. AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 13 1.3.4.  CT (Chapter 4).  CT provides crew members with the volume, frequency, and mix of training  necessary  to  maintain  proficiency  in  the  assigned  qualification/certification  level.  RAP  is  the  combat  coded/DOC-tasked  unit  CT  program  designed  to  focus  training  toward needed combat/contingency skills.  A crew member’s CT/RAP requirements are based on the crew member’s current experienced or inexperienced status.  When a crew member changes experience levels, training requirements will be prorated from the date of experience change. (T-3).  Specific RAP requirements are issued by MAJCOMs via the RTM. 1.3.5.  Unqualified  (UQ).    UQ  crew  members  fall  under  one  or  more  of  the  following categories: 1.3.5.1.  Downgraded  for  being  Non-Current  (Non-Combat  Mission  Ready  (NCMR), Non-Basic Mission Capable (NBMC)) longer than 180 days. 1.3.5.2.  Downgraded for a demonstrated lack of ability. 1.3.5.3.  Downgraded for failure to meet standards during a periodic evaluation or at the Commander’s  discretion  following  a  Commander-directed  downgrade  IAW  AFI  13-1 Vol. 2. 1.3.6.  Crew  member  Experience  Level.    Crew  member  experience  levels  are  designed  to indicate  to  unit  commanders  how  much  training  crew  members  need  to  maintain  CT/RAP requirements  and  therefore  proficiency.   Crew  members  will  be  designated  either “Inexperienced”  or  “Experienced.”  (T-3).  Unit  commanders  will  consider  previous  crew BMC2 experience when designating an experience level.  Should the unit commander opt for an early “experienced” level designation, a waiver request will be submitted within the parent Wing chain of command. (T-3).  Squadron Directorate of Operations Training (DOT) offices will document the crew member’s status IAW Chapter 8. (T-2). 1.3.6.1.  An experienced Air Battle Manager (ABM) will: 1.3.6.1.1.  Have one year in the AFSC (13BXX) after award. (T-3). 1.3.6.1.2.  If CRC is the first assignment: 1.3.6.1.2.1.  Have performed as a CMR/BMC ABM at the CRC for a period of 24 months. (T-3). 1.3.6.1.2.2.  Have  at  least  60  career  controlled  events  (live/virtual/constructive) while performing in a CMR/BMC/BQ status ABM in the CRC with at least 50% live/virtual events. (T-3). 1.3.6.1.3.  If designated experienced from another Battle Management Command and Control  (BMC2)  system  (Airborne  Warning  and  Control  System  (AWACS),  Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), Battle Control Center (BCC), or Modular Control Equipment (MCE)): 1.3.6.1.3.1.  Have performed as a CMR/BMC ABM at the CRC for a period of 3 months. 1.3.6.1.3.2.  Have  at  least  8  controlled  events  (live/virtual/constructive)  as  a CMR/BMC/BQ ABM in the CRC with at least 50% live/virtual controlled events. (T-3). 14 AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 1.3.6.1.4.  If  designated  inexperienced  from  another  BMC2  system  (AWACS, JSTARS, BCC, MCE): 1.3.6.1.4.1.  Have performed as a CMR/BMC ABM at the CRC for a period of 6 months. 1.3.6.1.4.2.  Have  at  least  60  career  controlled  events  (or  flying  sorties)  while performing in  a  CMR/BMC/BQ  status,  of  which  a  minimum  of  12 (live/virtual/constructive)  must  be  as  an  ABM  in  the  CRC  with  at  least  50% live/virtual controlled events. (T-3). 1.3.6.2.  An experienced Weapons Director (WD) will: 1.3.6.2.1.  Have one year in the AFSC (1C5X1D) after award. (T-3). 1.3.6.2.2.

(T-3). 1.3.6.3.  An  experienced  Air  Surveillance  Technician/Interface  Control  Technician /Surveillance Technician (AST/ICT/ST) will: 1.3.6.3.1.  Have one year in the AFSC (1C5X1) after award. (T-3). 1.3.6.3.2.  Have performed in that particular position, as CMR/BMC at a CRC, for a period of 6 months. (T-3). 1.3.6.3.3.  Have at least 60 career event operations performing duties in a CMR/BMC status, of which a minimum of 12 (live/virtual/constructive) must be in the CRC with at least 50% live/virtual) event operations. (T-3). 1.3.7.  Upgrade/Specialized  Training  (Chapter  5).    Upgrade/Specialized  training  is  training in any special skills necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned mission that is not required by every  crew  member.  Upgrade/Specialized  training  is  normally  accomplished  after  a  crew member  is  assigned  CMR/BMC  status  and  is  normally  in  addition  to  CMR/BMC requirements.    Unless  otherwise  specified,  CMR/BMC  crew  members  may  hold  special certifications as long as all training requirements, as applicable, are accomplished. 1.3.7.1.  Instructor/evaluator crew members are trained to instruct and/or evaluate duties associated  within  their  crew  positions.    Instructor/evaluator  crew  members  maintain CMR/BMC  status.  Instructors  may  perform  instructor  duties  as  long  as  they  are CMR/BMC, have a current  instructor qualification and are current  in  the event  they are instructing.    Instructors/evaluators  who  become  NCMR/NBMC  may  be  allowed  to continue academic and/or crew training device instructor duties with Group Commander approval.  ANG units and DRUs will request approval from ACC/A3C. 1.4.  Training Concepts and Policies. AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 15 1.4.1.  Training  programs  are  designed  to  achieve  the  highest  degree  of  combat  readiness consistent with flight safety and resource availability.  Training balances the need for realism against  the  expected  threat,  crew  capabilities,  and  safety.    This  volume  provides  training guidelines and policies to be used with  operational  procedures specified in  other applicable flying/operations publications. 1.4.2.  Air  Control  Squadron  (ACS)  Commanders  and  Director  of  Operations  will  have  or obtain  the  13B3D  AFSC  (Non-waiverable).  CRC  Commanders  and  DOs  will  maintain  a CRC ABM qualification. (T-2).     1.4.3.  Training  missions  are  designed  to  successfully  achieve/accomplish  unit  tasked missions, roles/capabilities, maintain proficiency, as well as to enhance safety.  RAP training missions are to emphasize combat/contingency skills through missions/scenarios that reflect procedures  and  operations  based  on  employment  plans,  locations,  current  intelligence,  and opposition  capabilities.    Units  are  to  train  using  procedures  and  actions  applicable  to combat/contingency scenarios (e.g. appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures, combat tactics, safe recovery procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions, intelligence briefings and debriefings). 1.4.4.  Crew  member  Supervision.    The  following  personnel  must  be  under  the  direct supervision  of  an  instructor/evaluator  when  performing  mission  positional  duties/tasks.  (T-3). 1.4.4.1.  Unqualified crew members. 1.4.4.2.  Crew members performing events in which they are non-current, unqualified or not certified. 1.4.4.3.  Crew members performing MQT, except as permitted in Chapter 3. 1.4.4.4.  Crew members downgraded to NCMR/NBMC. 1.4.5.  Medical Clearance (DD Form 2992). 1.4.5.1.  All  ABMs  must  maintain  a  current  qualification  and  medical  clearance documented  on  an  DD  Form  2992,  Medical  Recommendation  for  Flying  or  Special Operational Duty, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management. (T-2). 1.4.5.2.  All  1C5Ds  must  maintain  a  current  qualification  and  medical  clearance documented  on  a  DD  Form  2992,  IAW  AFI  48-123,  Medical  Examinations  and Standards. (T-2). 1.4.5.3.  Individuals without a valid medical clearance as annotated on a DD Form 2992 will not perform live operations. (T-2).

Personnel  going permanent  change of station  (PCS) or TDY to  a unit with  the same system of record may be continued in their previous training phase/qualification/certification, following local orientation and selected training, if applicable.  The completion date and test scores of written local area procedures examinations are documented IAW Chapter 8. (T-3). 1.5.  Ready Aircrew Program Policy and Management. 1.5.1.  The RTM when published, is  used in  conjunction with  this volume and may  contain updated requirements and definitions not incorporated in this volume.  The RTM is reviewed by  the  MAJCOM  throughout  the  training  cycle.    In  the  absence  of  an  RTM  and  for  non- combat coded units, crew members/individuals accomplish  the CT requirements outlined in unit supplements. 1.5.2.  Qualification/experience  levels  are  defined  by  a  total  number  of  RAP  events  and broken down into event types (Chapter 4). 1.5.3.  Progression from BMC to CMR requires: 1.5.3.1.  Lookback at CMR mission/event rate. 1.5.3.2.  Qualification  in  all  missions/events  and  any  specialized  mission/event  training required for CMR. 1.5.3.3.

Commanders  ensure  crew  members  are  trained  to  fill  authorized/required  crew positions per unit type code (UTC). 1.8.2.  Supervisors may assign crew members to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, safety board member, etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of crew member tasking, proficiency, currency, and experience. (T-3). 1.8.2.1.  Duties that would result in a crew member regressing to NCMR status are not to be performed. 1.8.3.  For  inexperienced  crew  members,  supervisors  will  make  every  attempt  to  limit  non- mission duties to those related to combat/unit mission training activities. (T-3). 1.8.4.  Crew  members  will  not  perform  long-term  duties  that  detract  from  their  primary duties of training for or performing the unit combat/specified mission. (T-3). 1.9.  Supplements/Waivers. 1.9.1.  Supplements. 1.9.1.1.  MAJCOMs  will  coordinate  their  supplements  to  this  instruction  with  HQ USAF/A3TY  before  publication.    MAJCOM/A3s  will  approve  MAJCOM  supplements.  Supplements will not contain procedures that are contrary to this instruction.  Copies of MAJCOM-level  supplements,  after  approved  and  published,  will  be  provided  by  the issuing  MAJCOM  to  HQ  USAF/A3TY,  HQ  ACC/A3C  the  user  MAJCOM,  and NGB/A2/3/6/10Y OPRs. 1.9.1.2.  Units  will  coordinate  their  supplements  with  the  next  higher  Group,  as applicable,  prior  to  MAJCOM  approval.  (T-3).    MAJCOM  OPRs  will  approve  unit supplements. (T-2).

This chapter outlines the conduct of IQT within the CRC.  IQT will normally be conducted  during  formal  syllabus  courses  at  the  CRC  Formal  Training  Unit  (FTU)  (607  ACS) whenever  possible.    IQT  may  be  conducted  at  the  operational  units  IAW  provisions  of  this chapter.    This  in-unit  IQT  will  be  conducted  using  appropriate  formal  FTU  syllabus,  flow programs, and requirements. 2.1.1.  Any individual who has been unqualified in the CRC for longer than 60 months must accomplish  IQT.  (T-2).    All  individual  crew  members  are  required  to  meet  IQT  syllabus standards. 2.2.  Authority. 2.2.1.  MAJCOM  approved  syllabi  (ACC/AETC  dual-signed)  lay  out  IQT  requirements  for each  duty  position.    Course  syllabi  do  not  take  precedence  over  the  guidance  in  this  AFI, unless  otherwise  stated;  however,  units  will  conform/adhere  to  the  grading  criteria, academic/performance it specifically conflicts with this AFI. (T-2). training  standards,  and  general/specific instructions  unless 2.2.1.1.  CRC IQT syllabi and course training documents are jointly developed by ACC TRSS, Detachment 9 and the FTU. 2.2.1.1.1.  ACC  TRSS,  Detachment  9  and  the  607  ACS  are  responsible  for developing, maintaining, and updating the syllabi (with oversight of ACC/A3CG and AETC/A3ZA),  academic  lessons,  and  academic  courseware  for  the  lessons  outlined in  the  IQT  syllabi.    The  syllabi  are  reviewed  IAW  ACCI  36-2252,  Air  Combat Command (ACC) Operations Training Publications, for ACC syllabi and AETCI 36-2221,  Flying  Training  Course  Publications  Development,  for  AETC/ACC  dual-signed syllabi to account for weapon system changes, course critiques, or other data that  necessitate  earlier  review.    ACC  TRSS  Det  9  documents  the  results  of  the syllabus  review  and  forwards  a  copy  of  the  documentation  to  ACC/A3CG, NGB/A2/3/6/10YG, USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3CO, AETC/A3ZA, 552 ACG, and ACC TRSS. 2.2.1.1.2.  Course training documents include everything required to conduct the IQT program.    The  training  package  includes  lesson  plans,  student  guides,  academic lessons,  block  tests,  and  Individual  Mission  Grade  Sheets  to  document  training results. 2.2.2.  IQT is accomplished using MAJCOM-approved syllabi. IQT is primarily conducted at the CRC FTU, but may also be conducted at the operational units if required.  IQT conducted at  the  operational  units  will  follow  the  IQT  time  limitation  requirements  outlined  in  this instruction.  IQT conducted at the FTU will follow the time limitation requirements outlined in the applicable syllabus. 2.2.3.  Elimination  Procedures.    Units  will  follow  IQT  elimination  procedures  outlined  in specific  course  syllabi  and  the  guidance  outlined  in  this  instruction.  (T-3).    TEB  process  is 20 AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 outlined in Attachment 5 and AFI 11-402 for aircrew members subject to Flying Evaluation Boards. 2.3.  Prerequisites.  Prior  to  entering  CRC  formal  training,  trainees  must  meet  Air  Force Education  and  Training  Course  Announcements  (ETCA)  selection  prerequisites  at  site  (T-2):  https://etca.randolph.af.mil/. 2.3.1.  Commanders  may  enter  newly  assigned  personnel  awaiting  a  security  clearance  into IQT,  but  may  not  give  training  that  involves  classified  information,  nor  conduct  live operations. 2.4.  Training Requirements. 2.4.1.  The  unit  DO  and  COT  review  the  records  of  newly  assigned  personnel  to  ensure  an appropriate course of training.  Experience and previous qualifications in the mission design series (MDS) are considered in determining the specific training track to be followed. 2.4.2.  Requalification.  If  a  crew  member  is  UQ  for  less  than  60  months,  the  COT  will determine  if  the  crew  member  will  be  entered  into  requalification  training  or  IQT.  (T-3).  After  a  records  review,  establish  a  tailored  training  program  for  individuals  based  on previous  CRC  experience  in  other  Battle  Management  Command  and  Control  (BMC2) systems and forward to DO for review.  The COT records the review IAW  Chapter 8. The DO ensures the COT provides the appropriate academic and/or positional training.  The COT may  use  MAJCOM  approved  IQT  syllabi,  MQT  materials,  and  other  locally  developed training  materials  to  conduct  requalification  training.    Requalification  training  is  used  to requalify: 2.4.2.1.  Crew  members  that  have  become  UQ  due  to  loss  of  currency  exceeding  180 days, or 2.4.2.2.

At  the  SQ/CC’s  discretion,  individuals  with  specific  prior  experience  or  positional qualifications can be entered into a tailored training program developed by the COT, rather than  a  formal  IQT  course,  to  prepare  them  for  their  initial  qualification  evaluation.    All tailored training plans are approved by the SQ/CC. 24 AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 3 MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING 3.1.  General.  This chapter outlines MQT required to qualify personnel to perform crew duties during CRC operational and training missions.  MQT is used to upgrade crew members from BQ to CMR/BMC status so as to accomplish the unit mission.  Crew members are to complete MQT for each positional qualification (i.e. a qualified ST is selected for upgrade to AST will complete MQT for the AST position following completion of AST IQT).  MQT is designed to be flexible to the dynamic changes and unique missions of the units covered by this instruction. 3.1.1.  MAJCOMs ensure MQT completion using MAJCOM-approved program.  Units using these  approved  programs  will  follow  the  guidance  within  the  applicable  course  control documents. (T-3). 3.1.1.1.  Units  will  develop  local  MQT  programs,  approved  by  MAJCOM,  if  higher headquarters developed programs are not provided. (T-2). Units using an academic test, the passing score will be 85 percent. (T-3). 3.1.2.  Prerequisites.  At  the  CRC,  individuals  must  possess  a  current  CRC  qualification  in order to be entered into MQT. (T-3). 3.1.3.  Elimination  Procedures.    Units  will  follow  MQT  elimination  procedures  outlined  in specific  course  syllabi  and  the  guidance  outlined  in  this  instruction.  (T-3).

MQT is completed IAW the appropriate CCDs in addition to the following. 3.2.1.  Personnel  who  complete  IQT  at  the  FTU  enter  MQT  NLT  20  calendar  days  (30 calendar days for ANG) after signing into their unit. 3.2.1.1.  Personnel who complete IQT at the FTU and subsequently attend FTAC at their home unit, will enter MQT the first duty day after completing the FTAC program. (T-3). 3.2.1.2.  Personnel  who  complete  IQT  at  the  operational  unit,  achieving  BQ  status  for their  duty  position,  are  immediately  (not  later  than  the  next  duty  day  or  next  Regular Schedule Drill (RSD) for ANG) released back to DOT and entered into MQT. 3.2.2.  Time  Limitations. All  trainees must complete MQT requirements  within 60 calendar days  (120  calendar  days  for  ANG)  of  entering  MQT.  (T-3).    Upon  completion  of  the  last block of MQT, the trainee is released to Stan/Eval to complete an evaluation IAW AFI 13-1 Vol. 2, Stan Eval. Individuals who fail their evaluation will return to DOT to complete all AT and then be re-released to Stan/Eval.  Failure of the trainee to complete MQT requirements within  the  above  time  constraints  results  in  the  COT  pursuing  actions  outlined  in  the following decision matrix and outlined in the flowchart at Attachment 3.  Trainees continue to train while the training extension request is being staffed. 3.2.2.1.  Upon reaching the 60th calendar MQT day (120th calendar MQT day for ANG), the trainee who does not complete MQT requirements is referred to the unit commander who is authorized to grant a 15 calendar day extended training period. AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 25 3.2.2.1.1.

Normal annual leave will not be considered as non-availability.  Exception: ANG members who were mobilized under Title 10 12302 or 12301d authority can have training requirements prorated for the period of leave accrued/taken under Title 10 status. individual 4.6.1.  Proration  is  based  on  cumulative  days  of  non-availability  in  the  training  cycle.  Use Table  4.1  to  determine  the  number  of  months  to  be  prorated.    Crew  members  start continuation  training  the  month  following  completion  of  MQT  and  receiving  initial 28 AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 CMR/BMC certification.  Crew members that become CMR/BMC after the beginning of the training cycle accomplish a prorated share of existing training cycle TRs for the remainder of the  period  beginning  with  the  first  day  of  the  following  month.    Training  accomplished during IQT/MQT is not counted toward CT requirements. 4.6.2.  All  training  requirement  events  are  rounded  down  to  the  next  whole  number  when prorating; however, no requirement may be prorated below 1. 4.6.3.  When  a  crew  member  changes  experience  levels,  training  requirements  are  prorated from  the  first  day  of  the  month  following  experience  certification.    When  a  crew  member achieves “Experienced” certification, their annual training requirements will be based on the experienced requirements in the RTM. 4.6.4.  Prorating of requirements are documented IAW Chapter 8. Table 4.1.  Proration Chart.  4.6.5.  Proration Example.  TSgt Garnett was granted 17 days of emergency leave in January and  attended  Non-Commissioned  Officer  Academy  (NCOA)  in-residence  from  March through  April  for  56  consecutive  calendar  days.    Using  the  numbers  from  Table  4.1,  TSgt Garnett would be authorized a total of two months proration (for the 73 cumulative proration days) from his/her training cycle. 4.7.  CMR/BMC  Regression.  NCMR/NBMC  crew  members  are  not  authorized  to  perform crew duties unless under instructor/evaluator supervision.  Downgraded crew members must be recertified,  in  writing,  by  the  SQ/CC  or  designated  representative  upon  completion  of  required tasks to return to status. 4.7.1.  Crew  members  shall  be  regressed  to  NCMR/NBMC  status  for  one  or  more  of  the following reasons (T-3): 4.7.1.1.  Failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph 4.8. 4.7.1.1.1.  To  regain  CMR/BMC  status  crew  members  will  follow  guidance  in paragraph 4.8.4. (T-3). AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 29 4.7.1.2.  Failure to complete training cycle CT/RAP requirements. 4.7.1.2.1.  To  regain  CMR/BMC  status  crew  members  will  follow  guidance  in paragraph 4.9.3.2. (T-3). 4.7.1.3.  Receiving an overall Q-3 on a QUAL or MSN evaluation IAW AFI 13-1 Vol. 2. 4.7.1.3.1.  To  regain  CMR/BMC  status  crew  members  will  complete  requirements identified on the AF Form 8 and successful reevaluation. 4.7.1.4.  At SQ/CC direction. 4.7.1.4.1.  Regaining CMR/BMC status will be IAW SQ/CC direction. 4.8.  Lookback.  Lookback  is  a  management  tool  used  to  determine  and  monitor  CMR  crew member proficiency during the training cycle. Lookback requirements are accomplished during a 3-month sliding window.  Lookback requirements are outlined in the RTM. 4.8.1.  Lookback does not apply to BMC or BQ crew members. 4.8.2.  DNIC/DNIF crew members’ training accomplishments on virtual/constructive systems will count towards lookback requirements. (T-3). 4.8.3.  Lookback  requirements  are  accomplished  during  a  3-month  sliding  window  and  are based on the experience level attained during the lookback period.  The COT will calculate the 3-month lookback no later than the 1st day of the month or ANG RSD. (T-3). 4.8.3.1.  Example.    SrA  Jones  (an  active  component  inexperienced  ICT)  participated  in two  event  operations  in  June  and  four  event  operations  in  July.    If  SrA  Jones  had  a  3-month lookback requirement of 9 events, he/she would need to participate in three event operations during the month of August in order to stay CMR. 4.8.3.2.  Lookback computations for newly qualified crew members begin the first of the next  month  following  completion  of  INIT  QUAL/MSN  Eval,  as  applicable,  and  3  full months of CMR status.  Computations for crew members being restored  to  CMR status will start the month following return to CMR status. (T-3). 4.8.3.2.1.  Example.    Capt  Garza  completed  INIT  QUAL/MSN  on  17  July.  Capt Garza’s lookback computations will not begin until 1 November.  Even though Capt Garza’s  lookback  does  not  start  until  1  November,  any  CT  accomplishments accumulated  from  17  July  –  31  October  are  counted  toward  annual  training requirements. 4.8.4.  Failure  to  Meet  3-Month  Lookback.    If  a  CMR  crew  member  fails  to  meet  the  3- month lookback requirement, commanders may: 4.8.4.1.  Regress the individual to NCMR status or 4.8.4.2.  Remove the individual from a CMR manning position or 4.8.4.3.  Initiate action to remove the crew member from active status or 4.8.4.3.1.  Place  the  crew  member  in  probation  status  for  1  month  (30  days).    If  the commander chooses probation, the crew member is required to reestablish a 3-month lookback by the end of the probation period to remain CMR. 30 AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 4.8.4.4.  Example.  SrA  Jones  (an  active  component  inexperienced  ICT)  participated  in one event operation in June, four event operations in July, and three event operations in August.    In  this  example,  SrA  Jones  did  not  meet  the  requirement  of  9  events  for  an inexperienced  ICT.    With  a  commander  approved  probationary  period,  SrA  Jones  must complete  two  event  operations  in  September  in  order  to  remain  CMR  after  his/her probation  period  expires.    The  completion  of  these  two  events  would  reestablish  SrA Jones’s lookback and prevent him/her from going NCMR. 4.8.5.  Crew  members  that  regress  to  NCMR  status  for  less  than  6  months  will  complete SQ/DO-approved  training  consisting  (as  a  minimum)  of  the  following  before  returning  to CMR status. (T-3). 4.8.5.1.  Monitored  by  an  instructor  for  a  minimum  of  two  control  events  for  weapons personnel,  two  link  events  for  ICT,  or  two  event  operations  for  all  others  or  until  such time the instructor recommends the individual be returned to CMR status.  Live, virtual, or constructive events may be used to meet these requirements IAW TR tables. 4.8.5.2.  Upon completion of the training and instructor recommendation (documented on an ACC Form 206 or MAJCOM equivalent), the SQ/CC returns the individual back into CMR/BMC status. 4.8.5.3.  The  missions  and  events  accomplished  during  the  training  may  be  credited toward a crew member’s 3-month lookback and total mission/event requirements for the training cycle. 4.8.6.  If a crew member is NCMR/NBMC for more than 6 months, the COT accomplishes the downgrade action to UQ status  after SQ/CC approval.   COT documents  the downgrade and enters them into requalification training with subsequent requalification evaluation. 4.8.7.  Document all actions IAW Chapter 8. 4.9.  Continuation  Training  (CT)    Requirements.  The  CT/RAP  training  cycle  consists  of academic and positional training requirements. 4.9.1.  The  SQ/DO  is  responsible  for  oversight  of  training  crew  personnel  on  the  general procedures and preparation for executing the unit’s DOC-tasked mission and any applicable operations plans. 4.9.2.  Academic Training Requirements.  The intent of the academic portion of CMR/BMC continuation training is to keep day-to-day training relevant and current with the unit’s DOC-tasked missions as well as dynamic real-world  contingency environment and ever-changing tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures.    Recommended  academic  topic  areas  and  hours  are  in Table 4.2. 4.9.2.1.  The  unit  COT  develops  an  academic  CT/RAP  Training  Plan  based  on  the review,  update,  and  expansion  of  existing  IQT/MQT  materials,  the  inclusion  of  RTM training  areas,  as  well  as  the  introduction  of  current  theater  interest/focus  areas.    The COT  also  includes  in  the  academic  training  plan  any  higher  headquarters  training inputs/guidance.  The proposed plan is submitted to the SQ/DO NLT 15 days prior to the start of the next training cycle for approval. AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 31 Table 4.2.  Academic Hours.  4.9.2.2.  The  COT,  with  the  approval  of  the  SQ/DO,  is  authorized  to  adjust  the  training plan throughout the training cycle to meet a dynamic operational training environment or to address any negative trends. 4.9.2.3.  The  COT  ensures  documentation  of  academic  CT/RAP  training  IAW  Chapter 8. 4.9.3.  Positional Training Requirements. The intent of the positional portion of CMR/BMC continuation training is to keep crew members proficient in the skill sets outlined in AFI 13-1 CRC (AN/TYQ-23A) Vol. 3, Operating Procedures – Control and Reporting Center (CRC).  Positional  TRs  are  to  be  accomplished  with  a  full  operations  crew  to  the  maximum  extent possible. 4.9.3.1.  The  COT  ensures  CMR/BMC  individuals  meet  positional  training  cycle requirements as outlined in the RTM for that training cycle. 4.9.3.1.1.  The  COT  ensures  documentation  of  positional  CT/RAP  training  IAW Chapter 8. 4.9.3.1.2.  Crew  members  may  accomplish  RAP/currency/lookback  by  using  any AN/TYQ-23A  version,  an  ACC/A3CG-approved  like  system,  an  ACC/A3CG-designated  approved  AN/TYQ-23A  simulator  (BC3  Mobile  Training  Suite  (MTS) executing  operations  IAW  AFI  13-1  CRC  series  instructions  and  applicable  TTP), AN/TPS-75, or AN/TSQ-147. 4.9.3.2.  Failure to Meet Positional Training Requirements. 4.9.3.2.1.  Unless waived IAW paragraph 4.4, crew members who fail to accomplish positional training requirements are regressed to NCMR/NBMC status. 4.9.3.2.2.  Unless waived, the crew member remains NCMR/NBMC until all overdue positional training requirements are accomplished or the crew member accomplishes appropriate/specific training, as directed by SQ/CC. 32 AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 4.9.3.2.3.  Unless specifically waived  IAW  paragraph 4.4, all training requirements for the previous training cycle must be completed before  events  are credited toward the next training cycle. (T-3). 4.9.3.2.4.  Squadron  Commanders,  via  TDRs,  must  inform  applicable  MAJCOM through their chain of command as soon as a potential training shortfall may result in individuals not meeting their training cycle requirements IAW  paragraph 1.2.6.5.1. (T-2). 4.9.4.  SQ/DOs  ensure  virtual/constructive  missions  are  accomplished  in  the  most  effective manner  possible  and  where  live  missions  are  deficient/insufficient.    Virtual/constructive missions/scenarios  increasingly  stress  a  more  difficult  tactical  scenario  as  individual  crew members  and  crews  become  more  proficient.    Finally,  virtual/constructive  missions  stress skills  or  situations  that  are  not  normally  controlled  under  live  conditions  (e.g.,  aircraft emergencies, multiple tankers in different airspaces). 4.9.4.1.  Virtual  missions  include  those  accomplished  through  any  of  the  following environments:  Virtual  Warfighting  System  (ViWS),  Distributed  Training  Operations Center (DTOC), and any other Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) entity (i.e. Virtual Flags, Fleet Synthetic Training – Joint (FST-J), etc.). 4.9.5.  CT-CMR/BMC Positional TRs are expressed in terms of the following events. 4.9.5.1.  Event  Operations.    An  event  operation  is  logged  for  training  accomplished during the following: live flying, virtual/constructive missions, MTEs, or Joint Exercises (JE).  To receive credit,  members sit on position a minimum  of 1 hour, or until  desired learning objectives have been met.  Log an event operation and, if applicable, a mission type (ITE),  Electronic Attack/Electronic Protection (EA/EP), or Link Event).  To the maximum extent possible, units  are  to  train  using  Tactical  Chat  (TC)  throughout  the  event  operation.    Whenever possible, a full operations crew is to be integrated with the event. Integrated  TACS  Event (Identification (ID)  Scenario, 4.9.5.1.1.  Units are given the discretion of employing available opportunities to meet practical  TRs,  however,  to  log  an  event  operation,  the  crew  member  must  actively engage/enter data into the system. (T-3). 4.9.5.2.  Controlled  Event.    A  controlled  event  includes  control  of  any  of  the  following mission  types:  counterair,  counterland,  air  refueling  (A/R).    A  controlled  event  is conducted in the environment listed in the associated training tables, found below, from check-in to hand-off or until the criteria for swapping controllers is met IAW paragraph 4.9.5.2.7. 4.9.5.2.1.  A  controlled  event  (ABM/WD)  may  be  credited  when  the  following criteria are met: 4.9.5.2.1.1.  Briefed the mission. 4.9.5.2.1.2.  Took radar/radio control of the aircraft performing the mission. 4.9.5.2.1.3.  Accomplished at least one of the following, counterair, air refueling, or counterland mission. 4.9.5.2.1.4.  Debriefed the mission. AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 33 4.9.5.2.2.  ABM/WDs may credit more than one type mission or training event during combined missions.  For instance in the course of a Large Force Exercise (LFE), if an ABM/WD  controls  counterair  and  a  refueling,  then  that  ABM/WD  may  log  a counterair  mission  and  air  refueling  mission,  with  one  controlled  event  along  with any other completed training requirements (i.e. Link, Integrated TACS, etc.). 4.9.5.2.2.1.  Example 1 (Same Mission Sets).  Capt Johnson, an ABM, controls a counterair  mission,  followed  by  an  air  refueling  event,  then  another  counterair event.    Capt  Johnson  receives  credit  for  one  controlled  event  along  with  one counterair event and one air refueling event (for the sub categories). 4.9.5.2.2.2.  Example  2  (Different  Mission  Sets).    Lt  McFadden,  an  ABM, controls a counterair mission, followed by an air refueling event, then a Personnel Recovery (PR) event.  Lt McFadden receives credit for one controlled event along with one counterair event, one air refueling event and one PR event (for the sub categories). 4.9.5.2.2.3.  Example  3.    TSgt  Dargan,  a  WD,  controls  a  counterair  mission, followed  by  an  air  refueling  mission.    After  meeting  the  criteria  to  swap controllers SSgt Gates then assumes control of the aircraft after the refueling and completes another counterair mission.  The result of this mission would be TSgt Dargan  would  receive  credit  for  one  controlled  event,  a  counterair  event  and  an air refueling event.  SSgt Gates would receive a controlled event and a counterair event if all "swapping controller" requirements are met (requisite brief, execution, and debrief). 4.9.5.2.3.  Counterair  Event.    The  ABM/WD  directs  at  least  one  flight  of  aircraft conducting air-to-air tactics against a dedicated adversary.  The WD will control the flight from check-in to hand-off, or until the criteria for swapping controllers is met. (T-3).  A flight contains at least two aircraft. 4.9.5.2.4.  Air  Refueling  (A/R)  Event.    The  ABM/WD  provides  control  to  an aircraft/flight  conducting  A/R  IAW  AFI  11-214,  Air  Operations  Rules  and Procedures.    The  ABM/WD  must  provide  the  appropriate  level  of  control  to  an aircraft, or flight of aircraft (where flight integrity is maintained) that rendezvous with a tanker/cell (or fighter simulating a tanker). (T-3).  During A/Rs the ABM/WD may credit one A/R mission per set of receivers or single receiver. 4.9.5.2.5.  Counterland  Event.    ABM/WDs  must  mission  plan,  brief  and  debrief  the conduct  of  the  counterland  scenario  including  coordination  with  external  agencies. (T-3).    The  ABM/WD  directs  at  least  one  flight  of  aircraft  conducting  counterland tactics against a ground objective.  The ABM/WD will control the flight from check-in  to  the  prosecution  of  at  least  one  objective,  or  until  the  criteria  for  swapping controllers is met. (T-3).  4.9.5.2.5.1.  A counterland mission normally includes the following elements: 4.9.5.2.5.2.1.  Airspace  management.  Assigning  altitude  blocks  and/or  safe deconfliction between aircraft (manned/unmanned). 4.9.5.2.5.2.2.  Target Area Brief: Air or ground picture and the objective area. 34 AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 4.9.5.2.5.2.3.  Dynamic/Deliberate  Tasking:  Updated objective. or pre-planned 4.9.5.2.5.2.4.  Mission  Report  (MISREP):  Mission  results  documented  and passed. 4.9.5.2.6.  Personnel Recovery/Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) Event. 4.9.5.2.6.1.  Manages/positions executing preplanned  or  real-time  PR/CSAR  plan  to  include  control  or  coordination  of PR/CSAR air support and Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD). participants  while PR/CSAR 4.9.5.2.6.2.  Manages  PR/CSAR  airspace  in  the  PR/CSAR  area,  if  tasked.  Assigns  altitude  blocks  and  establishes  deconfliction  plan  between  aircraft  to include manned/unmanned assets. 4.9.5.2.6.3.  Establishes/executes the PR/CSAR communications plan. 4.9.5.2.6.4.  MISREP: Mission results documented and passed. 4.9.5.2.7.  Swapping  controllers.    After  a  minimum  of  two  passes  or  a  knock  it off/terminate  during  counterair  employment,  A/R,  counterland  missions,  or  CSAR missions, controllers may hand off control of the mission to another controller so that more than one individual may log a controlled mission for a single set of activity. 4.9.5.2.7.1.  For  counterair  employment  missions,  each  controller  must  control fighters  from  fights  on/vulnerable  time  through  terminate/knock-it-off  using briefed control level. (T-3). 4.9.5.2.7.2.  For  A/R  missions  each  controller  must  meet  the  minimum  A/R mission requirements in order to log a controlled mission. (T-3). 4.9.5.2.7.3.  For  counterland  missions  the  ABM/WD  must  control  the  flight during the prosecution of at least one ground objective. (T-3). 4.9.5.2.8.  MC/SL certified ABMs may control one side of a mission (4v4 or less) and still  perform  MC/SL  duties  and  may  credit  a  controlled  event  and  event  operation.  The  MC/SL  certified  ABM  will  not  control  when  simultaneous  missions  are underway. (T-3). 4.9.5.3.  ID Scenario. Plan, execute and debrief the identification of airborne targets and execute tactical action, IAW the rules of engagement (ROE).  A spectrum from simple to complex ID scenarios should be exercised depending on training objectives; however, all ID scenarios will include a defined ID matrix and associated/defined ROE. (T-3). 4.9.5.3.1.  ID  scenarios  are  to  be  conducted  with  a  full  operations  crew  as  often  as achievable. 4.9.5.3.2.  The employment of an air defense artillery fire control officer (ADAFCO) and  associated  supporting  missile  batteries  outlined  in  AFTTP  3-1  CRC  are  to  be integrated when feasible. 4.9.5.4.  Integrated  TACS  Event  (ITE).    An  ITE  is  an  event  where  a  CRC  crew (ADAFCO  when  applicable)  plans  and  executes  operations  using  voice  and/or  datalink AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 35 (i.e.  transmit  and  receive  Link  messages  to  any  lateral/vertical  C2  entity)  while conducting CRC assigned missions. 4.9.5.4.1.  ITEs  are  conducted  with  a  full  operations  crew  to  the  maximum  extent possible. 4.9.5.5.  Electronic Attack/Electronic Protection (EA/EP).  An EA/EP event occurs when a  live  or  simulated  system  conducts  EA  against  the  AN/TPS-75  radar,  communications equipment,  or  other  equipment  which  requires/allows  the  crew  to  take  appropriate  EP actions.  Mutual interference from another AN/TPS-75 radar is not considered an external EA  source  and  does  not  constitute  credit  for  EA/EP.  Efforts  are  to  be  made  to  include EA/EP within ITEs. 4.9.5.5.1.  EPTs  also  perform  EP  events.  EP  includes  the  actions  taken  to  protect personnel,  facilities,  and  equipment  from  any  Electronic  Warfare  (EW)  attack  that may degrade, neutralize, or destroy friendly combat capability. (T-3). 4.9.5.6.  Link Events.  The environments listed in the training tables with respect to Link Events include live and virtual; however, constructive data being transmitted over either of these link environments meets annual training requirements. 4.9.5.6.1.  The ABM and WD credits one Link event each time they perform in their CMR/BMC  duty  position  and  a  Link  interface  is  functioning.  The  Link  event involves the sending and/or resolution of command/information messages. 4.9.5.6.1.1.  The ABM (SL certified) will be involved in duty related tasks such as ensuring  the  section  is  prepared  to  operate  within  the  link,  sending  or  resolving command messages, and coordinating with the MC. (T-3). 4.9.5.6.2.  The Air Surveillance Technician  (AST) credits one  Link  Event each time they set up, establish and monitor/maintain links IAW the Operational Tasking Data Link  (OPTASK  LINK)  with  a  minimum  of  one  hour  on  position  or  when  mission objectives have been met. 4.9.5.6.2.1.  The  AST  was  engaged  in  duty  related  tasks  such  as  ensuring  the surveillance  section  is  prepared  to  operate  within  the  link,  entering/exiting/ maintaining picture, designing/implementing/monitoring  filters,  directing  the  surveillance  section  and coordinating with AST (or equivalent) at linked units. ensuring current the link, a air 4.9.5.6.3.  The  ICT  credits  one  Link  Event  each  time  they  perform  in  their CMR/BMC  duty  position  and  they  meet  the  following  criteria:  Sets  up,  establishes and monitors/maintains links IAW the OPTASK LINK for a minimum of one hour or when mission objectives have been met. 4.9.5.6.4.  The ST credits one link event each time they perform in their CMR/BMC duty position and conduct air picture maintenance in a datalink environment. 4.9.6.  Training Event Definitions. 4.9.6.1.  Tactical  Chat  (TC).    Develop  familiarization  and  habit  patterns  with  TC hardware  and  software  while  employing  chat  capability  for  coordination,  targeting,  and training TTPs. 36 AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 4.9.6.2.  Procedural Control.  Utilization of procedural control (point outs from a fix, self-reporting,  etc.)  to  provide  deconfliction  of  two  or  more  flights  or  agencies  adjacent  in time,  space,  or  altitude.    If  simulated,  three  or  more  entities  are  required  for  credit.    At least one flight must be under ABM/WD control to log the event. (T-3). 4.9.6.3.  Dynamic  Targeting  (DT).    Dynamic  targeting  is  the  active  process  of identifying,  prosecuting,  and  effectively  engaging  emerging  targets.    The  primary  focus of dynamic targeting is the prosecution of Joint Forces Commander (JFC) designated and prioritized time sensitive targeting (TST) and functional component-critical targets. 4.9.7.  Communications  Jamming  Training.    This  paragraph  is  applicable  to  all  operations personnel  who  use  any  form  of  radio  communication.    Operations  personnel  will  be thoroughly  familiar  with  communications  jamming  (COMM  JAM)  procedures,  such  as recognition, reporting, and resolution. (T-3). 4.9.7.1.  Training  in  the  live  COMM  JAM  environment  is  to  not  only  emphasize operation and use of jam  resistant radios  through local  flying/employment  training with HAVE  QUICK  T-nets  but  also  the  use  of  brevity,  chattermark,  and  other  procedures.  Operations  personnel  need  to  periodically  train  with  other  participants  during  COMM JAM  for  those  occasions  when  the  anti-jam  (AJ)  mode  is  inoperative  or  not  available.  However, great care must be used to ensure realism in developing the tactics, techniques, and procedures to be used, as operating in a less than realistic COMM JAM environment may result in negative training event. intensity/frequency/duration 4.9.7.2.  Jamming JAM environment  considers  the  simulated  threat  and  training  objectives.    Jamming  sources may  include  cassette  recordings,  manual/automatic  jammers,  or  inherent  simulator jamming  equipment.    Ensure  jam  resistant  radio  failures,  synchronization  loss,  etc.,  are not unrealistically emphasized. in the simulated  COMM 4.9.7.3.  SQ/DO or designated representative ensures sufficient communications jamming training occurs to adequately prepare personnel to operate in a communications jamming environment. 4.10.  Currency/Regaining Currency. 4.10.1.  Currency.  See the RTM for currency requirements for all crew positions.  Positional currencies are established to ensure crew members maintain a minimum level of proficiency in  a  given  event  and  the  ability  to  safely  conduct  the  event.    If  a  crew  member  loses  a particular  currency,  that  event  may  not  be  performed  except  for  the  purpose  of  regaining currency.    To  regain/re-establish  currency,  events  must  be  accomplished  under  the supervision  of  an  instructor  or  Stan  Eval  Examiner  (SEE).   Instructors  must  be qualified/certified and current in all events they are instructing. (T-3).  If the instructor deems the event successful, he/she will document on an ACC Form 206 (or MAJCOM equivalent) then the COT will restore currency and document IAW Chapter 8. (T-3). 4.10.1.1.  Example.  SSgt  Smith  (a  CMR  ICT)  completed  an  event  operation  on  1  Nov.  She  would  then  need  to  complete  another  event  operation  on  or  before  31  Dec  (60 calendar  days)  in  order  to  remain  current.  If  she  does  not  fulfill  this  requirement,  she would be required to be supervised. AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 37 4.10.1.2.  Personnel  with  multiple  qualifications  must  maintain  “Event  Operations” currency (when applicable).  Event operations conducted in one position will not count in a separate crew position. (T-3). 4.10.1.2.1.  Events accomplished by ABMs who are certified as SLs and/or MCs only need to count accomplished events once. 4.11.  Unqualified  (UQ).  Unqualified is the status to which the unit commander downgrades a qualified individual for failure to maintain proficiency. 4.11.1.  The  SQ/CC  directs  the  downgrade  of  a  CMR/BMC  qualified  individual  to unqualified (UQ) status when the individual fails any positional evaluation, fails to complete a  periodic  evaluation  by  the  expiration  date,  fails  to  regain  BMC/CMR  status  within  180 days,  or  the  SQ/CC  determines  an  individual  to  be  non-proficient.    When  an  individual  is downgraded to UQ status, one of the following occurs: 4.11.1.1.  Direct  trainee  entry  into  requalification  training  for  30  days  IAW  paragraph  2.4.2 as required or 4.11.1.2.  Take  appropriate  administrative  action  IAW  Attachment  5,  AFI  36-2101, and/or AFI 11-402. 4.12.  Unit Certification Program.  Unit-unique positions will be given a certified status. (T-3). Certification  training  will  be  normally  conducted  within  the  owning  operational  or  training squadron  of  the  individual  receiving  the  training.    If  insufficient  squadron  resources  exist, missions  and/or  available  instructors,  certification  training  may  be  conducted  at  a  separate squadron.    The  certification  training  will  be  conducted  using  the  approved  training  syllabus.  When  applicable,  each  unit  develops  and  implements  a  training  program  for  all  unit  certified positions  IAW  MAJCOM/NAF/Group/unit  directives  and  document  the  certification  IAW Chapter 8. 4.12.1.  Requirements for Special Certifications. 4.12.1.1.  Training IAW Chapter 5 and applicable training guides (if available). 4.12.1.2.  Annual training requirements IAW the RTM and this AFI as applicable. 4.13.  Multi-Qualified/Certified Personnel. 4.13.1.  SQ/CCs  may  multi-qualify/certify  personnel  who  demonstrate  the  knowledge  and proficiency position qualifications/certifications.    Multiple  qualifications/certifications  provide  unit  commanders the flexibility to address a dynamic training environment and increase combat capability. to  maintain  multiple required skills CRC duty 4.13.1.1.  Multi-qualified CMR/BMC personnel must achieve the performance standards and  academic  TRs  for  each  position,  however,  when  the  academic  requirements  are identical, they need only be accomplished once. (T-3). 4.13.1.2.  Upon  completing  an  INIT  QUAL  for  a  secondary  qualification,  complete documentation IAW paragraph 8.3.1.6. Additionally, ensure the documentation reflects both a primary duty position and all other qualifications as secondary duty positions. 4.13.1.2.1.  A  separate  AF  Form  4142,  Individual  Annual  Training  Record,  must  be maintained for each duty position in which an individual holds a qualification. (T-2). 38 AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 4.13.1.3.  For  secondary  qualifications,  only  50%  of  “secondary”  positional  training requirements must be accomplished. (T-3).  4.13.2.  Multiple  system-qualified  personnel  are  only  required  to  meet  CT/RAP  TRs  as  if qualified on a single system with the additional guidance below. 4.13.2.1.  Events  accumulated  while  TDY,  to  include  contingency  operations,  may  be logged as CT events and may count toward training cycle events. AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 39 Chapter 5 UPGRADE/SPECIALIZED TRAINING/CERTIFICATIONS 5.1.  General.  This chapter outlines/establishes the minimum eligibility criteria and the training requirements for upgrade and specialized training. 5.1.1.  Upgrade/specialized training, for the purposes of this instruction, is defined as specific academic  and  positional in  a supervisory/higher  crew  position  that  has  as  a  prerequisite  and/or  a  current/previous qualification in another crew position (or experience level) within the same weapon system. to  qualify/certify  crew  members training  required 5.2.  Requirements.  Upgrade  training  requirements  provide  crew  members  with  the  academic, crew,  positional,  and/or  control  activity  needed  to  attain  a  supervisory/higher  level  of  crew certification/qualification.  MAJCOM-approved certification training programs are available via the Learning Management System (LMS). 5.3.  Waivers/Extensions.  Waiver  approval  authority  for  upgrade  requirements/prerequisites  is IAW paragraph 1.9.2. 5.4.  Instructor  Upgrade.  Instructor upgrade training prepares crew members for qualification as an instructor in their present crew position. 5.4.1.  Prior to nomination for instructor upgrade, crew members must be qualified/certified in the crew position in which they are selected to instruct. (T-3). 5.4.1.1.

General.  The  Mission  Training  Program  is  an  integral  part  of  the  overall  BMC2  training effort.  The simulation program is designed to provide a spectrum of training events to exercise individuals,  single  units,  and  multi-unit  configurations  in  a  high-  fidelity  virtual  battlespace.  This  training  program  utilizes  a  combination  of  mission  training  materials  and  a  full  scope  of MTEs. 6.1.1.  The MTP provides the CRC with a controlled and standardized event that can be used as  a  basis  for  valid  assessment  of  mission  crew  performance.    It  is  incumbent  upon commanders  at  each  echelon  of  command  to  support  this  training  activity  for  peak  unit combat readiness. 6.1.2.  Unit  COTs  are  to  seek  out  opportunities  to  train  with  elements  of  the  ground  TACS and  Airborne  Elements  of  the  TACS  (AETACS),  as  well  as  other  services.    Units  are  to participate in Command sponsored exercises to the maximum extent possible. 6.2.  Categories  of  MTEs.  These  events  are  categorized  by  the  number  of  participating  units and the level of effort within each unit.  There are three categories of MTEs. 6.2.1.  Category  I  (CAT  I).    Training  which  exercises  crew  positions  of  a  single  unit  (no external  participants/agencies).    The  scope  may  vary  from  positional  training  for  a  single section to involvement of an entire operations crew. 6.2.2.  Category  II  (CAT  II).    Small  scale  DMO  events  interfacing  the  CRC  with  a  DMO capable  weapons  system  to  execute  TTPs  and  focused  mission  type  training.    The  MTE includes an operational data link with at least two data link capable units participating when possible.  CAT II also includes training with other external agencies and is not limited to the DMO environment. 6.2.3.  Category  III  (CAT  III).    Multiple  external  agencies  usually  on  Distributed  Mission Operations  Network  (DMON)  or  Joint  Training  Exercise  Network  (JTEN).    Large  scale training exercises interfacing crews into a multi-unit distributed scenario.  The MTE includes an operational data link with at least two data link capable units participating.  The training emphasis  is  centered  on  accomplishing  the  interactions  which  are  essential  to  CRC operations and must include interfacing with another element of the TACS. (T-3).  This may include  a  higher  headquarters  element  and  at  least  one  other  Air  Force  or  joint/combined service element.  Units are encouraged to participate in large scale joint exercises i.e. Virtual Flags  (VF),  Fleet  Synthetic  Training-Joint  (FST-J)  events,  Joint  Kill  Chain  Events, Warfighter Focused Events (WFE), Red Flag, etc. 6.3.  Mission  Materials.  The  training  materials  provide  the  weapons  system  and  crew information  necessary  for  unit  personnel  to  perform  their  mission  essential  tasks.    These materials  include  contractor-generated,  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  generated,  and  unit generated products.  Guidelines for the integration of mission materials into the execution of the CRC functions are set forth in AFI 13-1CRC (AN/TYQ-23A), Vol. 3 and the applicable TTPs. 46 AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 6.4.  Simulation.  The CRC simulation  program  is  a means to  provide  effective training  on the mastery of key skill sets without the requirement of multiple live combat assets in the scenario.  The simulation events are broken into these basic areas: 6.4.1.  Individual Training.  Training designed for individuals to achieve a proficiency level to  fulfill  IQT  and  MQT  requirements.    CT  enhances  and  hones  initial  skills  to  achieve  a maximum level of proficiency in preparedness for combat. 6.4.1.1.  Simulation events consist of virtual and constructive entities.  Virtual entities use actual  weapons  system  operators  in  their  MDS  simulators.    Constructive  entities  are simulated entities that may or may not  be  actual  operators using simulation  models and communications  to  replicate  a  participating  platform  or  agency.    Computer  generated forces  are  simulated  entities  built  within  the  constructive  simulator  that  act  as  a  self-adjusting force against the trainer’s virtual entity. 6.4.2.  Single  Internal  Unit  Training.    Personnel  or  crews  are  trained  in  a  simulated operational  environment  to  enhance  cohesion  and  to  refine  coordination  between  the Operations  crew  members  and  the  unit’s  supporting  functions.    Communications  and simulation data are internally generated and distributed. 6.4.3.  Multi-Unit  External  Training.    The  participating  TACS  elements  and  CAF  aircraft units  train  to  perform  as  an  integrated  force.    The  two  major  network  backbones  used  to support  these  complex  simulation  events  are  the  DMON  or  the  JTEN.    MTEs  are  to  be conducted using the DMON to the maximum extent possible. 6.4.4.  DMO is a Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) directed readiness initiative to train warfighters.    The  DMO  vision  is  to  provide  warfighters  routine  in-garrison  access  to multiple,  simultaneous,  and  large/small  training  or  mission  rehearsal  events  within  a  true joint  force  environment  while  avoiding  the  traditional  expense  and  disruption  of  having  to assemble  assigned  units  and  opposing  forces  for  training  at  a  common  and  observable physical location.  The primary objective underpinning DMO is enabling warfighters to train as they would expect  to  fight,  maximizing the combat realism  available in modern visually immersive simulators that cannot be replicated in expensive traditional live training.  DMO capability  within the CRC enables a mission  crew, small  teams, or individuals to  train  in a stand-alone  or  networked  mode  with  other  DMO  participants  through  a  full  range  of composite force employment options. 6.5.  Principles of Mission Training Events.  MTEs are based on five established principles of learning. 6.5.1.  Function.  Train as a functional section, complete operational crew or as an integrated CRC.    MTEs  are  sufficiently  complex  to  allow  realistic  training  regardless  of  the  level  of participation.  Each element can receive, process, and take action on all essential information generally available within the platform. 6.5.2.  Realism.    Simulate  the  real  environment.    In  order  to  get  maximum  training,  the inputs,  interactions,  and  outputs  from  the  CRC  strive  for  realism.    Realistic  actions  are essential  in  order  to  maximize  the  transfer  of  training  to  actual  operations.    During  MTEs, personnel perform their functions just as they would in combat.  The exercise “White Cell” team observes and records crew performance. AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 47 6.5.3.  Stressors.  Train the mission crew to operate under stress.  The mission crew is trained to  effectively  handle  a  variety  of  stressful  situations  as  well  as  to  develop  and  keep  a  high level  of  proficiency  in  operations  execution  and  platform  interface.    Simulation  of  the battlespace  permits  control  of  the  LFE  or  contingency  theater  operations  training  situations introduced to operations not normally met in day-to-day training. 6.5.4.  Feedback.    Provide  the  participants  with  immediate  knowledge  of  mission  crew performance  in  order  to  improve  overall  performance.    Crew  members  being  trained  are furnished  feedback  from  the  mission  execution  results.    Detailed  performance  records  are kept  by  the  exercise  “White  Cell”  team  to  allow  the  team  to  systematically  assess participation,  identify  specific  problems,  capture  lessons  learned,  debrief  the  mission  crew, and provide positional trend analysis. 6.5.5.  Frequency.    Exercise  mission  crews  regularly  and  frequently.    An  effective  MTP requires that training events are held regularly and frequently.  Operational personnel are to continue  to  practice  in  handling  a  variety  of  battle  management  situations  if  they  are  to develop  and  maintain  a  high  level  of  proficiency  and  flexibility  in  the  use  of  operational skills and procedures. 6.6.  MAJCOM MTP Responsibilities. 6.6.1.  Supervise, select, schedule, coordinate, monitor, and direct CAT IIIs among assigned units. 6.6.2.

Follow guidance stipulated in unit OIs for DMO missions (if available). 6.10.7.  Coordinate  with  all  units  to  ensure  unit  training  objectives  are  implemented  in  the simulation  scenario  and  all  internal/external  units  training  objectives  are  understood  to maximize training for all exercise participants (CAT II & CAT III). 6.10.8.  Ensure MTE objectives are met. 6.10.9.  Ensure  an  After  Action  Report  is  produced  in  accordance  with  Figure  6.1  and submitted through channels to ACC/A3CG or USAFE-AFAFRICA /A3CO NLT ten working days following the end of an exercise. 6.11.  Exercise  Conduct.  There  are  three  phases  in  the  conduct  of  an  exercise:  planning, execution, and assessment. 6.11.1.  Exercise  Planning.    A  large  part  of  the  planning  process  is  to  determine  the  CRC mission essential competencies (MEC) to be demonstrated within the MTE prior to the start of the simulation exercise. MECs are the DMO higher-order individual, team, and inter-team competencies that fully prepare the operations crew for successful mission completion under adverse  conditions  and  in  a  non-permissive  environment.    They  are  demonstrated  in  the context of a high-fidelity simulated mission, under wartime conditions.  During the exercise, training  emphasis  may  be  placed  on  either  the  functional  interaction  of  the  participating elements  or  the  reactions  to  changing  situations  within  the  individual  units.    Also, commanders  may  emphasize  specific  parts  of  an  exercise  to  determine  strengths  and/or weaknesses,  and  to  identify  areas  requiring  additional  training.    The  planning  phase  of exercise  implementation  requires  that  exercise  personnel  at  all  echelons  check  MTE  Air Tasking  Orders  (ATO),  Airspace  Control  Order  (ACO),  Tactical  Operations  Data (TACOPDAT), OPTASK LINK, Enemy Order of Battle (EOB), Operations Plans (OPLAN), Operations  Orders  (OPORD),  and/or  the  exercise  description  in  detail  to  make  sure  they understand  the  exercise  content,  objectives,  and  requirements.    Thorough  pre-exercise briefings  are  an  integral  part  of  the  planning  phase.    Prior  to  the  exercise,  simulation personnel  are  to  be  briefed  on  the  training  objectives  and  MSEL  for  the  dynamically generated or scripted stress situations to be injected into the exercise.  Refer to Figure 6.4 for an example stress input sheet. 6.11.2.  Exercise Execution.  For effective training, unit personnel execute the exercise in the same  manner  in  which  they  would  operate  in  combat.    The  training  benefits  derived  from high-fidelity  simulations  are  directly  related  to  the  willingness  and  ability  of  simulation personnel to inject realism into MTE play.  For unit personnel to receive top benefit from an MTE,  it  is  necessary  for  the  White  Cell  to  be  familiar  with  the  agencies/positions  they  are simulating  and  to  be  as  realistic  as  possible  when  employing  simulation  techniques.    Sim drivers  are  encouraged  to  respond  and  react  as  if  under  real  combat  operations.    The simulated  environment  draws  responses,  reactions,  and  activities  from  the  participants  that are identical to an actual combat environment and requires strong command level support. 6.11.3.  Exercise  Assessment.    Exercise  assessment  is  a  program  for  measuring  operational effectiveness in each functional area and the crew as a whole in mission execution.  Data is collected by each element that takes part in an exercise.  The exercise debriefing log or any automated  tracking  program  can  be  used  to  record  data.    Proper  assessment  of  the  data AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 51 collected  during  exercises  serve  as  a  basis  for  identifying  execution  trends,  deficiencies, operational weaknesses, and other areas that need more training.  Post-exercise debriefings, attended by key simulation team personnel, are used during the exercise assessment phase as a means for identifying those areas that need more training. 6.11.4.  Exercise  Conduct.  The  briefing,  conduct,  and  debriefing  are  the  three  required functions  to  support  the  training  requirements  for  an  MTE  to  advance  MEC  skills  and knowledge. 6.12.  General.  The  MTE  provides  a  way  to  train  unit  personnel  and  may  be  conducted  either independently  or  in  conjunction  with  other  elements  of  the  TACS  and  CAF.    Through  the repetitive use of MTEs, simulated scenarios are set up in a realistic interactive environment that develops  the skills  of Airmen to  execute flawlessly without hesitation in  situations likely to  be encountered in real tactical operations.  Personnel taking part in these MTEs clearly understand their duties. 6.13.  Training Objectives.  The training objectives for the CRC MTEs are to: 6.13.1.  Execute MECs effectively in a Joint Tactical Air Operations (JTAO) battlespace. 6.13.2.  Provide training in the collection, transmission, receipt and processing of operational and intelligence reports. 6.13.3.  Direct  the  decentralized  execution  of  air  operations,  to  include  both  defensive  and offensive mission activities. 6.13.4.  Perform  weapons  control  functions,  as  directed  by  the  Air  Operations  Center (AOC)/CRC. 6.13.5.  Conduct  the  collection,  display,  evaluation,  and  reporting/telling  of  air  surveillance information. 6.13.6.  Coordinate and interface the identification function with other operations elements in the accomplishment of the classification function. 6.13.7.  Coordinate  defensive  actions  through  the  ADAFCO  to  the  associated  ADA  Fire Direction Center (FDC). 6.13.8.  Interpret  and  publish  supplemental  prearranged  Operational  Data  (OPDAT)  in  US Message Text Format (USMTF). 6.13.9.  Provide link interface training of both internal and external circuits in the execution of the OPTASK LINK. 6.13.10.  Exercise the processing and exchange of the simulated link data. 6.14.  MTE  Scheduling.  The SQ/DO is ultimately responsible for the scheduling of all MTEs.  The SQ/DO may delegate MTE scheduling duties to the Operation Plans and Exercises branch. 552 ACG units coordinate MTE participation through 752 OSS/OSO; other units may  use PEX or  other  MAJCOM  approved  scheduling  tools  to  schedule  participation  in  DMO  events.    The intermediate headquarters when necessary will assist in the coordination and support for the units during larger virtual exercises if needed. (T-3). 6.15.  Mission  Commander  Responsibilities.  The  mission  commander  is  responsible  for preparing the crew to complete the MTEs using the briefing and debriefing guides. 52 AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 6.16.  Simulation  Team  (White  Cell)  Responsibilities.  The  team  is  to  portray  the  various external  agencies  and  information  sources  that,  for  reason  of  practicality  or  economy,  do  not actively take part in the MTE. 6.16.1.  The  team  coordinates  requirements  and  actions  among  the  exercise  participants.  Members  are  selected  for  their  knowledge  and  experience  in  the  areas  and  functions  to  be simulated. 6.16.2.  The  team,  under  the  guidance  of  the  Simulation  Supervisor  (for  smaller  training events) or the Exercise Director (for larger or full crew training events), plan and execute a MSEL in order to facilitate the flow of events while ensuring all training objectives are being accomplished in an efficient manner. 6.16.3.  Prior to beginning a MTE, the team members assume their positions and check their equipment and communications for proper operation.  Following the exercise, the simulation team  collects  and  passes  all  pertinent  information  obtained  in  the  event  to  the  Simulation Supervisor or the Exercise Director. 6.16.4.  All  simulation  team  members are to  familiarize themselves with  unit OIs  for DMO prior to the event (if available). 6.17.  Exercise  Simulation.  External  agency  simulation  consists  of  those  inputs  that  would normally be received from non-participating agencies.  The following list describes the functions of some of the external agencies that may be simulated. (Not all inclusive) 6.17.1.  ADA weapons simulation provides for the input of Army air defense weapons status information. 6.17.2.  Pilot  simulation  is  performed  on  the  Instructor  Operator  Stations  (IOS)  with  the simulation drivers realistically responding to ABM/WD instructions. 6.17.3.  Wing  Operations  Center  (WOC)  simulation  personnel  perform  those  functions normally  done  by  the  operations  staff  at  various  air  base  WOCs.    The  simulation  team normally  performs  all  WOC  functions  during  MTEs.    During  warfighter  exercises  and Virtual  Flags,  a  White  Force  cell  at  705  CTS,  Distributed  Mission  Operations  Center (DMOC) or other distributed locations can provide WOC simulation for the exercise. 6.17.4.  Air  Traffic  Control  (ATC)  simulation  involves  interaction  between  ATC  agencies such  as  control  towers,  Federal  Aviation  Administration/International  Civil  Aviation Organization  (FAA/ICAO)  centers,  radar  approach  control  (RAPCON),  and  other  facilities which  process  flight  data.  In  some  instances,  multi-user  Tactical  Chat  or  instant  messaging system may be used. 6.18.  Briefings  and  Debriefings.  MTE  briefings  and  debriefings  will  be  conducted  IAW  the procedures described in this instruction and AFI 13-1CRC (AN/TYQ-23A) Vol. 3. (T-3). Figure 6.1.

This needs to be specified in the tasking message and clearly communicated to all sections during the pre-MTE conference calls.  Ensure the exercise tasking letter specifies the onsite and offsite testing times, and ensure everyone agrees to it, during the pre-MTE conference calls.     However we never pre-tested segment 3.  We need to pre-test the segment we intend to use prior to the MTE.  other units and USAFE to determine if there is an accurate ATO for this segment.

Training impact:  The overall training value for this exercise was excellent. Mission planning was effective and units were in constant contact throughout the months leading up to this MTE.  Required information was effectively passed between the Tactical Operations Center (TOC) and the Unit Command Center and the participating units.  This allowed all units to effectively train at all positions. 6.  CRC Simulation Critique:  Review all aspects of the exercise areas and critique each area.

MAJCOMs  may  use  separate  chapter  supplementation  or  publish  a  combined basic  publication  which  includes  supplemental  guidance.    If  the  combined  method  is  used, MAJCOM-specific  guidance  follows  the  applicable  paragraph  in  the  basic  volume  with  the appropriate MAJCOM acronym inserted after the paragraph number. AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 59 Chapter 8 OPERATIONS TRAINING DOCUMENTATION 8.1.  Introduction.  Documentation  of  academic  and  positional  training  accomplishments provide a current record of an individual’s training throughout their career.  This information is vital  for  an  accurate  assessment  of  the  individual’s  currency,  lookback,  training  cycle  TRs,  as well  as  overall  experience  level.    Units  with  access  to  Patriot  Excalibur  (PEX),  LMS,  or  other MAJCOM-approved program will use these along with any unit methods to document academic and positional training accomplishments. (T-2). 8.2.  Operations  Training  Records  Maintenance.  Unit  DOT  maintains  operations  training records for all assigned/attached 13B/1C5 personnel. 8.3.  Forms.  This instruction prescribes the use of AF Form 4141, AF Form 4142, and refers to the  AF  Form  8,  Certificate  of  Aircrew  Qualification,  which  is  prescribed  by  AFI  13-1  Vol.  2. Instructions for completing these forms are contained within the electronic form and this chapter.  Units with access to PEX, LMS, or other MAJCOM-approved programs will use the applicable program  as  the  primary  system  of  documentation.    For  units  that  use  a  system  of  record  (i.e. PEX,  LMS, or other MAJCOM-approved system) for tracking qualifications and certifications, the  AF  Form  4141  or  AF  Form  4142  generated  using  that  system  may  omit  items  that  are  not functional  in  that  program,  if  those  items  are  tracked  in  the  same  system  elsewhere  and  are available for viewing and modification by unit leadership. 8.3.1.  AF  Form  4141,  Individual’s  Record  of  Duties  and  Experience  Ground  Environment Personnel.  DOT maintains a training history on all operations personnel to record significant occurrences  during  an  individual’s  training.    The  COT  will  use  these  instructions  in conjunction  with  the  ACC/A3CG-provided  LMS  Training  Documentation  (TD)  table  for completing the AF Form 4141 within the LMS. (T-2).  Units using PEX or other MAJCOM- approved programs will use these instructions in conjunction with the programs’ functions to complete the AF Form 4141.  Instructions for completing AF Form 4141 are in Attachment 6.  The following events must be recorded (T-3): 8.3.1.1.

Assigned/attached personnel possessing a 13BXX/1C5X1/1C5X1D AFSC who maintain CMR/BMC qualification or certification. 8.3.2.1.2.  A  separate  AF  Form  4142,  must  be  maintained  for  each  duty position/qualification or certification an individual holds. (T-2). 8.3.2.2.  Completed AF Form 4142s are maintained IAW paragraph 8.4. 8.3.3.  AF  Form  8,  Certificate  of  Aircrew  Qualification.  This  form  is  primarily  used  by Stan/Eval  to  record  evaluations;  however,  the  COT  uses  it  to  certify  completion  of  any additional training requirements that result from evaluations.  The instructor completing the additional training (or last training event if more than one) will notify the COT, or NCOIC if COT  is  not  available,  that  additional  training  is  complete  (along  with  providing  supporting mission grade sheet  documentation).  (T-2).    The COT or NCOIC as noted above, will sign and date the “Date Additional Training Completed” block in Section II of the AF Form 8. (T-2).  Specific guidance for completing the AF Form 8 is contained in AFI 13-1 Vol. 2. 8.4.  Permanent Training Record.  DOT maintains a permanent training record for all assigned and attached personnel.  DOT uses individual 6-part folders and identifies each folder by typing the  individual’s  last  name,  first  name,  and  middle  initial  in  capital  letters  on  a  standard  size folder  label.  This  label  is  affixed  to  the  folder’s  tab.    Folders  must  bear  the  “Privacy  Act” statement  and  a  “For  Official  Use  Only”  label/stamp  on  both  sides  of  the  folder.  (T-2).    The training  officer  may  pencil  in  additional  information  on  the  label  (e.g.,  rank,  crew,  director designator).    Tests  or  test  answer  sheets  are  not  filed  in  this  folder.    Current  AF  Form 4141/Training  History  and  AF  Form  4142  may  be  kept  in  a  separate  binder  or  maintained electronically  on  an  approved  system  (PEX,  LMS,  etc.)  for  ease  of  record  keeping,  but  forms will  be  returned  to  the  permanent  training  records  prior  to  the  individual’s  PCS.  (T-3).  The permanent training record is organized as follows: 8.4.1.  The Section I, Qualification Data.  This section contains the current copy of AF Form 4141/Training History and AF Form 4142. Place the AF Form 4141/Training History on the left  side  and  AF  Form  4142  on  the  right  side  of  Section  I.    A  DD  Form  2861,  Cross-Reference, can be used to reflect the location of the information. AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 61 8.4.2.  The  Section  II,  Personal  History.   This  section  contains  any  other  current records/documents  pertaining  to  qualifications,  certifications  or  proficiency,  to  include waivers.    Within  this  section,  DOT  also  maintains  ACC  Form  206s  (or  MAJCOM equivalent)  for  training  accomplished  within  the  last  year  (return  to  status  following NCMR/NBMC, additional training as a result of an evaluation, IQT or MQT, etc.). After one year,  these  ACC  Form  206s  (or  MAJCOM  equivalent)  are  moved  to  Section  IV  and maintained IAW paragraph 8.4.4. 8.4.2.1.  System-specific  task/task  qualification  or  the  computer-generated  product  (e.g. Difference Training), is maintained in this section or in a database.  All other information will be filed in chronological order (with most recent on top). (T-3). 8.4.3.  The  Section  III,  Medical  Qualification/Medical  Waivers.    This  section  includes  a current  copy  of  the  DD  Form  2992,  Medical  Recommendation  for  Flying  or  Special Operational  Duty,  for  all  13BXD  and  1C5X1D  personnel.    A  DD  Form  2992  placing  an individual  on  DNIC  status  is  also  kept  during  the  DNIC  period.    When  applicable,  the  AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record, is placed behind the current DD Form 2992.  In addition, medical profiles that affect operational status will be filed in this section. (T-3).    Sensitive  medical  history  or  other  records  of  a  personal  medical  nature  will  not  be maintained in this file (non-waiverable).  If medical documentation is sensitive, a memo for record, signed by the commander, is placed in this section.  After an individual is placed on DNIC status, DOT will keep the DD Form 2992 during the DNIC period (30 days or more), and annotate the AF Form 4141/Training History. (T-3). 8.4.4.  The  Section  IV,  Training  History.    This  section  includes  certificates  from  AETC courses,  MAJCOM  formal  courses,  and  any  formal  ground  environment  training.    This material is filed chronologically with the most recent on top and kept as a permanent part of this folder.  Also contained are the commander’s justification for late entry into IQT.  Upon PCS, all computerized products must be converted to hardcopy and placed in the appropriate section. (T-3). 8.4.4.1.  All  ACC  Form  206s  (or  MAJCOM  equivalent)  moved  here  from  Section  II following the first year will be maintained in this section for a minimum of one more year (longer periods of ACC Form 206 (or MAJCOM equivalent) maintenance as directed by the SQ/CC or SQ/DO are authorized).  These ACC Form 206s (or MAJCOM equivalent) will be filed behind all the historical information noted above. (T-3). 8.4.5.  The Section V, Miscellaneous Experience.  This section contains completed AF Form 4141/4142  and  control  experience  forms  from  other  commands.    File  these  forms chronologically with the latest date on top as a permanent part of the training folder. 8.5.  Transfer  of  Records.  Upon reassignment (PCS/Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) only),  an  individual  will  hand  carry  the  permanent  records  to  the  gaining  unit.  (T-3).    If  the losing  and  gaining  units  are  using  PEX,  LMS,  or  other  MAJCOM-approved  program,  transfer the individual’s records IAW the program’s parameters. 8.5.1.  Where available, the information required by AF Form 4141/4142 will be maintained within  the  PEX,  LMS,  or  other  MAJCOM-approved  program  IAW  MAJCOM  guidance (instead  of  hardcopy).  (T-3).    If  using  PEX,  LMS,  or  other  MAJCOM-approved  program units will use the specific program’s parameters to transfer the records.  If the individual is 62 AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 PCSing  to  a  unit  that  does  not  have  PEX,  LMS,  or  other  MAJCOM-approved  program access,  print  a  hardcopy  of  the  individual’s  AF  Form  4141/Training  History,  place  this hardcopy in the six-part training folder and have the individual hand carry the folder to next unit. 8.6.  Training  Deficiency  Reports  (TDR).  This  paragraph  prescribes  the  method  for  units  to submit training deficiency reports.  Units are required to provide training status IAW paragraph 1.2.6.5.1. 8.6.1.  A  unit  commander  submits  a  TDR  to  identify  problems  beyond  the  unit’s  ability  to resolve that may prevent the unit or individual(s) from satisfying academic or positional TRs.  TDRs identify  known or potential training problems  to  higher headquarters for information and  management  purposes.    TDR  identified  issues  are  to  be  resolved  at  the  lowest  level  of command.  TDRs may be submitted at any time during the training period. 8.6.2.

MAJCOM and NAF personnel are examples of attached personnel. Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC)—A  crew  member  who  has  satisfactorily  completed  IQT  and MQT, is  qualified in  some aspect  of the unit mission, but  does not  maintain CMR status.   The crew  member  must  be  able  to  attain  full  qualification  to  meet  operational  taskings  within  30 days.  This status also applies to those individuals who are assigned to a unit that does not have a DOC tasking.  BMC crew members do not maintain CMR status due to duty assignment or other reasons as determined by the appropriate authority. Basic  Qualified  (BQ)—A crew member who has satisfactorily completed IQT and is qualified to  perform  crew  duties  within  the  unit.    The  member  must  perform  at  the  minimum  frequency necessary to meet lookback/currency. Certification—1)  Procedure  used  to  document  competency  in  a  particular  task.  Not interchangeable  with  “qualification,”  which  requires  AF  Form  8  documentation.  2)  A  formal indication of an individual’s ability to perform a task to required standards. 3) The formal action of completing/signing documentation taken by a certification official, i.e., “the unit commander certified the AF Form 8”.

Constructive—Constructive  entities  simulate  real  world  or  virtual  systems  automatically,  or manually driven by an operator or a white force  - personnel supporting distributed training that operate  as  training  aids  for  warfighters  accomplishing  readiness  training.    Models  and simulations  that  involve  simulated  people  operating  simulated  systems.    Real  people  stimulate (make inputs) to  such simulations.  Constructive simulations can also  be used to  model natural processes without human involvement (e.g. weather). Currency—Currency  is  associated  with  specific  training  requirements  and  is  a  Commander’s tool  established  to  ensure  crew  members  maintain  a  minimum  level  of  proficiency  in  a  given event. Difference Training—Difference training is accomplished for crew members qualified in a duty position assigned or transferring to a CRC/DRU with specialized/unique equipment or following significant upgrades to the unit’s current system. Distributed  Mission  Operations  (DMO)—A  training/exercise  environment  that  uses  virtual and  constructive  entities  to  conduct  mission  training  from  individual  operator  training  through LFE  scenarios.    DMO  encompass  DTOC/  Air  Reserve  Component  Network  (ARCNet)/Virtual Warfighting System (ViWS) and any other DMO entity (i.e. Virtual Flag, FST-J, etc.). AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 71 Distributed  Training  Operations  Center  (DTOC)—Provides  daily  training.    Full  Spectrum DMO support from  small-scale to  large force scenarios.  Most events  are  individually focused, but  capable  to  support  multi-player  events  with  mission  planning  and  white  force  support.  Current  and  qualified  pilots  use  simulation  tools  and  communications  to  replicate  participating aircraft. Evaluation—1)  The  procedure  to  determine  the  effectiveness  of  the  performance  of  an instructional product or process in order to ascertain specific causes for the effectiveness or lack of it, and to make decisions appropriate to the extent of the effectiveness.  Evaluation of formal courses  includes  field  evaluation  and  internal  evaluation.  2)  The  review  and  analysis  of qualitative  or  quantitative  data  obtained  from  design  review,  hardware  inspection,  testing  or operational  use  of  equipment.  3)  The  positional  and  written  examinations  used  to  determine proficiency as prescribed by governing directives. Event  Operation—A  term  used  to  describe/capture  training  tasks  by  crew  position  that  once accomplished may be logged/credited toward the crew member’s continuation training cycle or RAP training event requirements. Experienced—A category of crew members associated to crew position, and defined by one or more of the following criterion:  AFSC, type of qualification, amount of time the individual has been qualified. Extended Training Period—Training period designed for individuals who fail to progress into the next phase of training. Inexperienced—A category of crew members that do not meet the criterion required to establish experienced status. Initial  Qualification  (INIT  QUAL)—The  first  evaluation  given  to  determine  an  individual’s Basic Qualification (BQ) status. Instructor—Experienced  CMR/BMC  individual  qualified  to  instruct  the  operations  duties  of  a designated crew position(s). Initial  Qualification  Training  (IQT)—Provides  the  training  needed  to  qualify  for  basic  crew duties in an assigned crew position without regard to the unit’s  mission.  Graduates of IQT are awarded BQ (NCMR/NBMC) status after successful completion of an evaluation. Learning  Management  System—An  Air  Combat  Command  approved  training  management system  used  to  provide  online  courseware  and  tracking  of  training  accomplishments  for  the ground  command  and  control  units.    It  provides  a  myriad  of  training  management  reports  on individual training accomplishments and is accessible via the internet to all users. Mission Evaluation (MSN)—An evaluation given after MQT to certify an individual as CMR. Mission—Department  of  Defense  definition:    The  task,  together  with  the  purpose,  that  clearly indicates  the  action  to  be  taken  and  the  reason  therefore.    In  common  usage,  especially  when applied to lower military units, a duty assigned to an individual or unit, a task.  For the purpose of  this  AFI,  a  more  detailed  explanation  of  this  term  applies:    A  mission  includes  briefing, controlling and debriefing.  Briefings include training objectives.  Controlling consists of taking radio  and  radar  control  of  aircraft  and  accomplishing  one  or  more  types  of  missions,  such  as counterair,  air  refueling,  counterland,  and  active  air  defense  scrambles.    Debriefing  occur  with 72 AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 the  pilots  (and  instructor  where  applicable).    The  brief/debrief  may  be  accomplished  via telephone/radio; however, face-to-face briefs provide optimum training. Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Specific training designed to prepare crew members to perform duties/tasks in support of a unit mission or tasking. Non-Combat Mission Ready/Basic Mission Capable (NCMR/NBMC)—The status of a crew member:  1)  who  failed  to  meet  lookback;  2)  who  failed  to  complete  training  cycle  CT/RAP requirements; 3) downgraded at the direction of the commander. Positional  Training—Hands-on  training  resulting  from  performance  of  duties  in  assigned positions. Proficiency—A  measure  of  how  well  a  task  is  completed.    A  crew  member  is  considered proficient when they can perform tasks at acceptable levels of speed, accuracy, and safety. Prorating—A process used to determine a crew member’s training requirement proportionately based on approved consideration to include TDY (including contingency operations), medically disqualified/DNIC, or emergency leave status for more than 30 days. Qualification—A  status  assigned  to  a  crew  member  after  completion  of  specific  positional training  and  the  accomplishment  of  an  evaluation  resulting  in  the  generation  of  AF  Form  8 documentation. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP)—RAP is a MAJCOM specific Continuation Training program that applies to CMR crew members.  RAP guidance is issued either by memorandum to combat coded/DOC-tasked units or this AFI to non-combat coded units.  It is intended to focus training toward  current  and  relevant  combat  skills.    The  MAJCOM  RTM  provides  positional  event requirements outlined in Chapter 4 for combat coded units. Regular Schedule Drill (RSD)—For the purpose of this instruction, a RSD is the 2 day period per month ANG personnel spend on duty, the RSD is 1 full ANG drill weekend. Requalification Training—Training for crew members who are designated UQ who 1) fail any positional evaluation, 2) fail to complete a QUAL MSN by the scheduled date, 3) fail to regain currency  within 180 days, (N/A/  following Aerospace Expeditionary  Force (AEF) deployment) or 4) who are determined by the unit commander to be non-proficient. Training Period—A specific amount of time to accomplish a prescribed phase of training. Training Cycle—A specifically defined period associated with defining, tracking, reporting, and documenting continuation/RAP  Training requirements. The training cycle is  1 October through 30 September. Unqualified—The  status  of  an  individual  who:  1)  Downgraded  for  being  non-CMR/non-BMC (NCMR/NBMC) greater than 6-months or 2) Downgraded for a demonstrated lack of ability or 3)  Downgraded  for  failure  to  meet  standards  during  a  periodic  evaluation  or  at  Commander discretion following a Commander-directed downgrade Upgrade  Training—Specific  academic  and  positional  training  required  to  qualify  in  a supervisory/higher  crew  position  that  has  as  a  prerequisite,  a  current/previous  qualification  in another crew position (or experience level) within the same weapon system. AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 73 Virtual—Involves warfighters operating simulated systems.   Virtual  simulations  inject  human- in-the-loop in a central role by exercising motor control skills (e.g., flying an airplane), decision skills  (e.g.,  committing  fire  control  resources  to  action),  or  communication  skills  (e.g.,  as members of a C4I team). Virtual Warfighting System (ViWS)—The pilot position in a Mission Training Center (MTC) that  dynamically  simulates  flight  characteristics.  Used  for  normal,  emergency,  and  instrument procedures, to include safety of flight, warfighting tasks, and skill integration training (see, AFI 36-2251).  DMO time is only counted if a unit has a MTC.  74 AFI13-1CRCAN_TYQ-23AV1  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 Attachment 2 INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING TIME LIMITATIONS FLOWCHART Figure A2.1.

General.  The  purpose  of  this  attachment  is  to  establish/outline  procedures  to  be  taken when  personnel  not  subject  to  Flying  Evaluation  Boards  outlined  in  AFI  11-402  fail  to  make satisfactory progress in initial qualification, mission qualification, or continuation training.  This attachment  only  applies  to  personnel  (officer  and  enlisted)  assigned  to  a  CRC,  not  subject  to Flying  Evaluation  Boards  outlined  in  AFI  11-402.    The  complete  rights  of  personnel  are contained in this attachment.  A TEB is not required for individuals in training for secondary or beyond qualifications. A5.1.1.  The TEB is an administrative, fact-finding proceeding designed to ensure the quality control  of  the  CRC/DRU  force.    Board  members  examine  an  individual’s  professional qualification for CRC/DRU related duties and evaluate/determine potential for use in future operations. A5.2.  Policy.  Per AFI 36-2626, Airman Retraining Program, Air Force policy is to retain and retrain  only  those  Airmen  who  have  demonstrated  the  ability  to  successfully  complete  training and  whose  past  record  clearly  justifies  further  training.    IAW  training  syllabi  elimination procedures,  utilization  of  the  administrative  actions  outlined  in  this  attachment  are  based  upon failure  of  an  individual  to  attain  a  duty  qualification,  failure  to  re-qualify,  or  to  maintain proficiency levels outlined in this instruction.  These procedures are not  meant to replace or be used in place of punitive disciplinary action and are not a substitute for action under the UCMJ, state military law, or other administrative directives. A5.3.  TEB  Convening  Authority.  The  TEB  convening  authority  is  the  organization  at  the Group  level  or  above  with  the  authority  to  direct  a  unit  commander  to  establish  a  TEB.    The commander/organization  having  a  command  relationship  with  the  unit  conducting  the respondent’s  training  has  convening  authority/jurisdiction  for  establishment  of  the  TEB.    The convening  authority  for  ACC  active  duty  units  is  the  552  ACG  Commander.    The  convening authority  for  ACC-gained  units  and  for  DRUs  is  ACC/A3C.    The  convening  authority  for PACAF  and  USAFE-AFAFRICA  units  are  PACAF/A3/6C  and  USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3C, respectively  (notify  NGB/A2/3/6/10Y  for  ANG  personnel  as  applicable).    The  TEB  convening authority  may  be  delegated  to  the  unit  commander  on  a  case-by-case  basis  by  the  unit commander’s next higher authority.  The commander initiates the TEB process by forwarding a TEB request to the convening authority for review/action. A5.3.1.  Appeal  Authority.    The  appeal  authority  for  the  TEB  process  outlined  in  this attachment  is  the  convening  authority.    In  cases  in  which  the  unit  commander  is  the convening authority, the appeal authority is the commander/organization having a command relationship with the unit conducting the member’s training. A5.3.2.  Cause.    Failure  of  a  crew  member  to  attain  or  maintain  qualification  in  a  crew position and/or failure to meet required standards when enrolled in an upgrade course. A5.3.3.  Respondent.
