Start the Engine and Check Test for Hydraulic Leaks o o  o o o   o o o o o  o o o o o  o o o Secure all loose articles in cab (they might interfere with operation of the controls or hit the operator in a crash). Start the engine. Test for hydraulic leaks. If the vehicle has hydraulic brakes, pump the brake pedal three times. Then apply firm pressure to the pedal and hold for five seconds. The pedal should not move.  If it does, there may be a leak or other problem. Brake system. Test parking brake. Fasten safety belt. Set parking brake (power unit only). Release trailer parking brake (if applicable). Place vehicle into a low gear. Gently pull forward against parking brake to make sure the parking brake holds. Repeat the same steps for the trailer with trailer parking brake set and power unit parking brakes released (if applicable). If it doesn't hold vehicle, it is faulty; get it fixed. Test service brake stopping action. Go about 5 miles per hour. Push brake pedal firmly. "Pulling" to one side or the other can mean brake trouble. Any unusual brake pedal "feel" or delayed stopping action can mean trouble. If the trainee finds anything unsafe during the vehicle inspection, get it fixed. Federal and state laws forbid operating an unsafe vehicle. Check vehicle operation regularly: Instruments. Temperature gauges. Pressure gauges. Ammeter/voltmeter. o o   Mirrors. If the trainee sees, hears, smells, or feels anything that might mean trouble, he/she should check it out. Safety inspection. Document any discrepancy on AF Form 1800.  Sign-off AF Form 1800 to signify accomplishment of inspection.
