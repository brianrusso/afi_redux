General.  This  instruction  provides  guidance  to  protect  and  sustain  the  lives  of  aircrew members and AFE personnel during counter CBRN operations, and is complemented by AFI 11-301, Volume 3, Aircrew Flight Equipment Contingency Operations. 1.1.1.  Increased  mobility-demands  and  bare  base  deployments  require  greater  attention  be given to multi-unit cohesiveness and team effort.  Sharing collective resources mandates the need  for  standardizing  equipment,  training,  and  procedures.    It  is  likely  that  units  will  be responsible  for  processing  aircrew  not  assigned  to  them,  (e.g.  NATO  Nations,  other  DOD agencies, etc.).  For the purpose of this manual, an aircrew is defined as anyone (non-ground crew personnel) who arrives at the entrance of the ACCA needing assistance.  A sample of applicable  aircrew  (not  all-inclusive)  would  be  aircrew/pilots  of  Fighter,  Airlift,  Rotary aircraft  (to  include  foreign  partners),  Aeromedical,  Battlefield  Airmen,  and  Distinguished personnel. 1.1.2.  AFE  personnel  must  be  ready  and  capable  of  assisting  any  uninjured  aircrew  who arrive  at  their  shelter  or  ACCA  (injured  aircrew  will  be  directed  to  the  hospital).    (T-1)  Creative  resourcefulness  is  necessary  for  operating  within  an  ever-changing  theater  of operation. 1.2.  Delegation  of  Authority.  Pursuant  to  Headquarters  Air  Force  Mission  Directive  1-54, Deputy  Chief  of  Staff,  Operations,  HQ  USAF/A3X  delegates  to  HQ  USAF/A3XI  career  field management  responsibilities  for  Air  Force  Specialty  Codes  (AFSC)  1P0XX,  Aircrew  Flight Equipment (AFE).  In this capacity, HQ USAF/A3XI will establish policy guidance from the Air Staff,  which  addresses  all  related  resources  and  training.    Additionally,  HQ  USAF/A3XI  will provide  technical/functional  input  to  Air  Force  Personnel  Center  Civilian  Personnel  officials regarding  General  Schedule  (GS)  1601/1670  and  Wage  Grade  (WG)  4818  career  field management  matters.    HQ  USAF/A3X  also  delegates  to  HQ  USAF/A3XI  the  responsibility  of oversight and standardization of unit level training programs supporting upgrade training.  (T-1) 1.3.  Supplements and Waivers. 1.3.1.  MAJCOMs  and  Field  Operating  Agency  (FOA)  Functional  Managers  (FM)  may supplement this instruction for their unique programs IAW AFI 33-360.  Supplements must be routed for coordination prior to certification and approval to the OPR of this publication, HQ USAF/A3XI, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1480.  (T-1) 1.3.2.

Chemical Warfare.  The United States is a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons.  The  convention  does  allow  quantities  of  chemical  warfare  materials  for  research  purposes.    In order  to  deny  an  enemy  any  battlefield  advantage  from  the  use  of  chemical  weapons,  US  Air Forces shall be capable of conducting and sustaining essential operations in a chemical warfare agent (CWA) contaminated environment.  (T-1) 3.1.1.  General.    CWAs  are  classified  based  upon  persistency  and  physiological  effects.  Persistent, semi-persistent, and non-persistent describes the duration effectiveness of CWAs.  Physiological classification describes chemical agents according to their effect on the body.  The six major types are nerve, blood, blister, choking, psychochemical, and irritant. 3.1.2.  Persistent  and  Semi-Persistent  Agents.    These  agents  are  used  to  impede  the  use  of critical terrain, channelize the attacking force, or contaminate materiel.  Persistent and semi-persistent  agents  produce  casualties  (immediate  or  delayed)  when  the vapors  are inhaled  or the  agent  contacts  the  skin.    Additionally,  they  contaminate  materiel  and  degrade  unit efficiency.    Persistent  and  semi-persistent  agents  force  personnel  into  higher  levels  of mission-oriented  protective  posture  (MOPP),  which  results  in  degraded  operational capabilities and decreased morale.  Examples of persistent and semi-persistent agents include HD (distilled mustard), VX, TGD (thickened GD [soman]), GF (cyclosarin), and GB (sarin). 3.1.3.  Delivery.    CWAs  may  be  disseminated  using  mortars,  artillery,  rockets,  mines, aircraft, aerosol generators, missiles, and covertly by special operations forces or terrorists. 3.2.  Biological  Warfare  (BW).  The  U.S.  will  not  use  biological  agents,  including  toxins, regardless of source or manner of production, or other methods of biological warfare under any circumstances.  The U.S. will strictly limit its biological and toxin research program to defensive measures, such as production of vaccines, antidotes, treatment, and protective equipment.  U.S. policy  is  in  accordance  with  the  1925  Geneva  Protocol  and  the  1972  Biological  Weapons Convention, both of which the U.S. has ratified.  However, U.S. Air Forces must be prepared to mitigate an enemy’s use of biological warfare agents (BWAs).  (T-0) in   BWAs  are  classified 3.2.1.  General. three  general  categories:  pathogens (microorganisms), toxins, and bio-regulators/modulators.  Many BWAs are more toxic than chemical agents are and may cause casualties at lower dose levels.  They can be spread more easily over a wide area and are effective at lower exposure levels.  Incubation periods vary from  hours  to  weeks.    Some  agents  kill,  while  others  incapacitate.    Some  agents  are contagious,  while  others  are  not.    Vaccinations,  prophylaxis,  and  medical  treatment  after sickness are effective only for some agents, not all. 3.2.2.  Differences  between  Biological  and  Chemical  Weapons.    Biological  and  Chemical Weapons  attacks  differ  in  several  ways.    Chemical  agents  are  all  manufactured,  non-living poisons,  whereas  BWAs  are  either  microorganisms  or  chemicals  produced  by  biological organisms.  Biological agents are generally more toxic than chemical agents are and require smaller  amounts  to  cause  illness  or  injury.    It  is  difficult  to  detect  and  identify  the  large number of biological agents.  Most agents do not create a surface contamination hazard or a AFMAN11-301  22 JULY 2016   9  post  dispersal-aerosolizing  problem.    The  exceptions  are  those  disseminated  as  spores.  Although biological and chemical defenses  are similar, significant differences influence  the planning and preparation for BW. 3.2.2.1.  Wide  Area  Coverage.    A  biological  weapon  can  create  an  aerosol-generated hazardous  environment  over  a  much  larger  area  than  a  chemical  weapon  with  the  same amount of agent (by weight) due to the high toxicity of biological agents. 3.2.2.2.  No  Off-Gassing.    The  only  evaporation  from  pathogens  is  water.    Although toxins  are  organic  chemicals,  their  vapor  pressures  are  so  low  that  they  are  unable  to create  a  vapor  hazard.    The  high  efficiency  particulate  air  (HEPA)  filters  found  in collective protection systems are effective in providing protection against these biological agents. 3.2.2.3.  Numerous  Potential  Agents.    Because  of  the  numerous  categories  of  potential biological  agents,  pathogens  and  toxins  cannot  be  easily  grouped  for  developing  a common detection technology. 3.3.  Radiological  Particles.  Significant  amounts  of  radioactive  material  may  be  deposited  on surfaces  after  the  use  of  a  nuclear  weapon,  a  Radiological  Dispersal  Device  (RDD)  (a  “dirty bomb”  is  a  common  term  for  an  RDD)  or  after  a  nuclear  reactor  malfunction.    Military operations  in  these  contaminated  areas  will  require  an  evaluation  of  the  potential  hazards  and may require protective actions and contamination mitigation.  Operations could result in military personnel  receiving  radiation  exposure  or  contact  with  particulate  contamination,  which  would require processing through an ACCA.  (T-0) 3.3.1.  Nuclear radiation.  Nuclear radiation is characterized as initial or residual.  The initial radiation is produced within one minute of the event.  Residual radiation, also referred to as delayed fallout, occurs over a period.  Fallout is composed of radioactive particles from the bomb and material from the surface of the earth that is carried into the air by the explosion.  The  larger  particles  return  to  the  earth  within  24  hours,  but  the  smaller  dust  particles  may take several months to fall.  For the purposes of AFE and ACCA processes/procedures, the “R” and the “N” in CBRN represent the same threat. 3.4.  Decontamination  versus  Contamination  Mitigation.  The  terms  “decontamination”  and “decontaminate” carry an expectation by an aircrew.  For instance, if a technician tells an aircrew to  “decontaminate  their  gloves  by  wiping  them  with  a  bleach  soaked  towelette”,  the  aircrew would, after wiping their hands as told, expect their gloves to now be “decontaminated”.  While bleach will actually neutralize hazardous agents, the amount of time it takes (which differs based on  the  make-up  of  the  contaminated  material)  is  not  conducive  to  AFE,  ACCA  and  flying operations.    Additionally,  detection  capabilities  do  not  detect  to  low  enough  levels  to  ensure safety of aircrew.  Finally, the agents used to neutralize hazardous material could have negative effects on the flight worthiness of the aircrew equipment.  These factors have led to the need to use  the  term  “contamination  mitigation”  in  lieu  of  the  term  “decontaminate”.    As  AFE professionals  working  in  an  ACCA,  we  mitigate  the  negative  effects  of  human  contact  with hazardous material. 3.5.  Contamination  Mitigation.  In  an  effort  to  mitigate  particle  cross  contamination  and reduce risk, aircrew and flight equipment must be handled appropriately.  Mitigation procedures   10  AFMAN11-301  22 JULY 2016 will  not  degrade  the  performance  of  personnel,  but  may  have  negative  effects  on  the  flight worthiness of flight equipment.  (T-1) 3.6.  Types  of  Decontaminates.  There  are  three  general  types  of  decontaminants—natural, standard, and miscellaneous.  There are also developmental decontaminants that are being tested and evaluated. temperature. 3.6.1.  Natural  Decontaminants.    There  are  multiple  natural  decontaminates,  the  following information  discusses  weathering,  winds,  and   Weathering  gradually decomposes Chemical Biological (CB) agents by aeration, hydrolysis, and evaporation.  The time necessary  for decontamination by weathering depends on the persistency of the agent, its  composition,  climatic  conditions,  and  the  type  of  surface.    Although  weathering  is  the easiest method of decontamination, persistency of an agent is difficult to predict.  Therefore, mission  deadlines, weather conditions, or  hazards to  unprotected  personnel may require the use of a faster method of decontamination.  Additionally, winds rapidly disperse the vapors of the chemical agents while high temperatures speed up the change of state for liquid vapor (evaporation) and hasten the dispersion of chemical agents in the air. 3.6.2.  Standard Chemical Decontaminants.  There are multiple chemical decontaminants; the following information discusses Super Tropical Bleach (STB), High Test Bleach (HTB), and Household  bleach.    Refer  to  AFTTP  (I)  3-2.60,  CBRN  Decontamination:  Multiservice Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear Decontamination; Appendix C for mixing requirements. 3.6.2.1.  STB is a decontaminating agent for most Chemical Warfare (CW) agents.  STB is  a  mixture  of  chlorinated  lime  and  calcium  oxide  in  a  white  powder  form.    STB,  in  a dissolving  solution,  may  be  substituted  for  household  bleach.    When  manufactured,  it contains  30  percent  available  chlorine.    Because  of  this  chlorine  content,  a  protective mask  and  gloves  should  be  worn  when  handling  STB.    STB  decomposes  slowly  in storage;  this  decomposition  is  easily  recognized  by  the  chlorine  odor.    STB  may  cause serious  degradation  of  electronic  equipment,  it  is  corrosive  to  most  metals,  and  it  is injurious to most fabrics.  Mixing STB with water facilitates its distribution. 3.6.2.2.  High-Test  Bleach  (HTB)  or  High  Test  Hypochlorite  (HTH).    HTH  is  a  bleach material typically found in granular or tablet form, containing a minimum of 70 percent calcium hypochlorite.  The compound contains a higher percentage of chlorine than STB and  is  more  corrosive.    Therefore,  HTH  cannot  be  used  for  the  decontamination  of individuals  and  personal  protective  material  unless  diluted/dissolved  to  safe  solution level. 3.6.2.3.  Household Bleach.  Household bleach is 2 to 6 percent sodium hypochlorite in water.    ACCA  operations  require  5  percent  chlorine  solution,  which  allows  household bleach  to  be  used.    Read  product  labels  to  ensure  exact  percentage  of  bleach.    (T-2)            NOTE – Units that comply with an Aircraft Radiological Recovery Plan established for their base are exempt from the radiological aspects of this manual. AFMAN11-301  22 JULY 2016   11  Chapter 4 AIRCREW CBRN OPERATIONS 4.1.  CBRN  Defined.  Operations  that  include  CBRN  materials,  either  individually  or  in combination.    Collectively  known  as  weapons  of  mass  destruction  (WMD),  CBRN  replaces "Nuclear,  Biological,  or  Chemical  (NBC)"  when  used  in  reference  to  operations  or  incidents limited  to  WMD  issues.    Toxic  Industrial  Chemicals  or  Toxic  Industrial  Materials  (TIC/TIM) and Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) are considered part of the "C" in "CBRN". 4.2.  ACBRN  Training.  AFE  AFECTIs  will  utilize  lesson  plans  from  LL04  to  train  aircrew members on all aspects of ACBRN.  (T-1) 4.2.1.  All deployable AFE personnel will be trained in ACCA operation, management, and aircrew processing procedures using the ACCA Station Attendant Master Lesson Plan from the  USAF  AFE  SharePoint®.    All  AFE  units  (to  include  non-operational  units)  should possess  or  have  access  to  at  least  one  set  of  training  ACBRN  equipment  and  a  processing system.  Units will coordinate procurement of assets with their owing MAJCOM.  (T-2) 4.2.2.  Maintenance  and  Ground  Support  Personnel  Training.    Sortie-generating  specialists require  specific  training  on  launch  and  recovery  of  aircrew  in  a  CBRN  environment.    AFE will provide “Train the Trainer” method training to these individuals only when tasked, using guidelines  and  procedures  established  in  section  4.7.11  of  this  instruction.    It  is  the responsibility of Maintenance personnel to request training.  (T-2) 4.3.  Equipment.  Ensure  the  full  Basis  of  Issue  (BOI)  for  ACBRN  operations  is  available  for each aircrew member deployable to a CBRN threat area.  Aircrew will be sized, fitted and issued required equipment; refer to AFI 11-301 V2 for BOI and options for ACBRN equipment.  (T-2) 4.3.1.  Units  will  comply  with requirements.  (T-2) theater-specific  reporting instructions  for  ACBRN 4.3.2.  Unit AFE personnel will maintain individual aircrew sizing information in the Flight Equipment Records Management System (FERMS) or equivalent.  (T-2) 4.4.  Medical  Concerns.  AFE  supervisors  must  be  aware  of  and  ready  to  combat  the physiological  and  psychological  effects  of  ground  and  aircrew  personnel  operating  in  CBRN Individual Protective Equipment (IPE).  Awareness of these concerns and individual familiarity with protective equipment are essential toward optimizing performance. 4.4.1.  Physiological  Effects.    Heat  stress  can  be  a  significant  thermal  burden  for  personnel wearing CBRN equipment.  Heat stress can influence human cognitive activity, which could be  critical  in  an  ACCA  or  flying  situation,  requiring  efficient  and  error-free  performance.  Personnel must adapt to wearing CBRN equipment and adhere to work/rest cycles and fluid replacement guidelines as outlined in AFTTP 3-4, Airman’s Manual.  (T-2) 4.4.2.  Psychological Effects.  Supervisors must always be aware of the psychological effects personnel experience when they are wearing protective clothing.  These effects may include claustrophobia,  apprehension,  paranoia,  disorientation,  distorted  bodily  sensations, hallucinations, confusion, and panic.  Frequent training in IPE reinforces familiarization and confidence  in  proper  donning  procedures.    IPE  training  should  also  reduce  the  adverse   12  AFMAN11-301  22 JULY 2016 physical and psychological effects associated with repeated or prolonged wearing of IPE.  (T-2) 4.5.  Safety.  ACBRN  defense  clothing  is  designed  to  absorb  and  contain  liquid  and  vapor agents.  Therefore, the safety of individuals wearing ACBRN defense clothing is influenced by the  following  factors:    Exposure  levels,  ambient  temperature,  wind,  humidity,  moisture, inclement weather, physical exertion, anxiety, stress, and individual health. 4.5.1.  Exposure  Levels.    The  level  of  contamination  encountered  by  aircrew  members  is determined by the concentration, type of agent or toxin, and exposure time.  Although direct contact  with  CBRN  hazards  represents  the  greatest  danger  to  aircrew  and  AFE  personnel, vapor exposure is more likely. 4.5.2.  Aircrew  are  strictly  prohibited  from  conducting  contamination  mitigation  procedures on  other  aircrew  members  or  assisting  other  aircrew  members  with  doffing  of  dirty ensembles unless specifically directed by the attendant while in the processing line.  (T-2) 4.6.  Aircrew  Sheltering.  Sheltering  is  divided  into  two  distinct  categories:    Collective Protective  (COLPRO)  sheltering  and  non-protective  sheltering.    Aircrew  and  AFE  personnel may be exposed to one or more of these types of sheltering during operations, depending on the location. 4.6.1.  COLPRO  Sheltering.    Over-pressurization  keeps  contaminants  out  of  the  shelter  to provide a Toxic Free Area (TFA) for personnel to rest and prepare for operations.  In some cases,  the  ACCA  processing  line  is  incorporated  into  these  structures,  in  other  cases  the ACCA processing line will “end” at the entrance to one of these facilities.  These shelters are most often used in areas or environments where sheltering must be provided in the attack or threat area.  They may also be used to provide sheltering for key operations in the threat area such  as  a  functional  workstation,  AFE,  a  battle  staff,  or  a  flight  operations  section.    Types include  Survivable  Collective  Protection  System  (SCPS),  Joint  Expeditionary  Collective Protection  (JECP),  Transportable  Collective  Protection  System  (TCPS),  interconnecting KMU-450,  and  the  Simplified  Collective  Protection  Equipment  (SCPE).    The  following information should be helpful in recognizing the options that might be available to personnel during various operations. 4.6.1.1.  SCPS.  These hardened shelters use 65-cm thick walls, are buried, and have been reinforced with steel and earthen coverings to provide protection in an actual threat area.  They have been designed to offer various levels of protection against 500-kg bombs at 2 meters and direct hits from artillery and bombardment.  These structures, like other over-pressurized  facilities,  have  capacity  limitations  and  cannot  be  relocated  during  times  of conflict. 4.6.1.2.  TCPS/JECP.    This  system  integrates  over-pressurized  bladders,  filters,  and blowers into pre-existing tents  and structures.   It allows individuals the ability to  safely process  into  these  tents  by  providing  over-pressurization  of  the  structure  as  well  as airlock entryways.  However, it does not provide hardened protection.  The advantage of this system, over a buried structure, is its mobility. 4.6.1.3.  SCPE.    Like  the  TCPS,  SCPE  (M2OE1/XM28)  is  an  inflatable  bladder  that converts a pre-existing structure, room, or tent into a contamination free area.  With its air lock  entryway,  the  SCPE  like  other  collective  protection  systems  has  been  designed  to AFMAN11-301  22 JULY 2016   13  allow clean entry processing.  While large enough for over-pressurizing a small room or battle  staff  quarters,  it  is  not  typically  large  enough  to  house  or  accommodate  sleeping arrangements for more than a few people.  Benefits associated with collective protection shelters are their ability to maintain operations within the contaminated threat area, their close proximity to duty stations, and the minimized need for transporting personnel out of the threat area.  The over-pressurized shelter system with the best processing rate is the TCPS.    TCPS  are  capable  of  processing  a  maximum  of  12  aircrew  members  per  hour.  Because these facilities or systems have inadequate processing capabilities and shortfalls, AFE personnel must have alternative processing solutions available.  (T-2) 4.6.1.4.  Non-Protective Sheltering.  Does not provide protection against liquid or vapor chemical agent threats.  However, overhead protection lessens exposure to liquid agents, while  not  protective  against  vapors,  is  considered  a  form  of  chemical  agent  protective sheltering.    Additionally,  shelters  providing  protection  from  the  natural  elements increases  the  effectiveness  of  both  personnel  and  ensembles  in  a  chemical  threat environment.    Therefore,  while  these  facilities  are  considered  a  non-protective  shelter, they do enhance CBRN operations.  When personnel are transported away from the threat area  and  processed  using  open-air  procedures,  a  pressurized  system  is  not  necessary.  Coordinating an ACCA under bare base conditions must be done in unanimity with other deployment considerations.  The coordination, planning, and establishment of an open-air ACCA  are  discussed  in  detail  later  in  this  chapter.    The  location  of  non-pressurized sheltering is also important.  Shelters, rest stations, and toxic free work areas should not be attached or located within 200 yards of any ACCA.  The establishment and location of these  shelters  should  prevent  them  from  being  moved  during  changes  in  local  wind direction or being exposed to contaminant build-up from any ACCA/CCA.  (T-2) 4.6.1.5.  Open-Air  Processing.    The  deployed  location  will  be  divided  into  sectors  or zones  to  aid  in  identifying  ground  attacks  locations  and  chemical/biological  response.  When  a  portion  of  the  base  becomes  contaminated,  the  Wing  leadership  will  determine which  sector/zone  will  remain  in  MOPP  4  and  which  sectors/zones  can  be  reduced  in MOPP.  EM personnel are responsible for determining the location of the Contamination Control Area (CCA) based on the information gathered after the attack.  The Emergency Operations  Center  (EOC)  or  CBRN  Control  Center  is  responsible  for  notifying  the ACCA Manager after an attack and to direct the team to the current location of the CCA.  Upon notification from the EOC, the ACCA Manager will notify all AFE sections outside of  the  affected  area  to  dispatch  to  the  ACCA  location  (as  required).    Factors  such  as attack location and ACCA location will influence AFE personnel response times.  (T-2) 4.6.1.5.1.  The ACCA is designed to be mobile and collocated ideally near the CCA and medical treatment facility.  Operating under typical constraints, the ACCA shall be  assembled  and  ready  to  process  aircrew  within  one  hour  of  notification.    (T-2)  NOTE:  Assembly  time  is  dependent  upon  location  of  ACCA,  relative  to  the proximity of responding AFE personnel. 4.6.1.5.2.  The ACCA  will be covered or stored indoors when not in  use,  to prevent contamination of equipment during attacks.  (T-2) 4.6.1.5.3.  ACCA  station  components  will  be  systematically  packed  in  container,  in order to aid attendants in assembly and response time.  (T-2)   14  AFMAN11-301  22 JULY 2016 4.6.1.6.  Hardened  Facilities.    Due  to  space  availability  of  hardened  facilities,  ACCA operations  accomplished  in  a  hardened  facility  should  follow  the  intent  of  the  ACCA placards, but  may differ slightly. The AFES at hardened  facility locations will establish location specific procedures as required.  (T-2) 4.7.  ACCA Staffing and Personnel Actions.  AFE personnel shall ensure work/rest cycles are planned and implemented to necessitate sustained CBRN operations IAW AFTTP 3-4, Airman's Manual.  AFE personnel will refer to this manual for guidance on wear times, proper work/rest requirements, and fluid replacement guidelines.  (T-2) 4.7.1.  Consider  how  stress,  fatigue,  physical  condition,  sleep,  exposure,  fear,  dehydration, and injury, may affect your ability to sustain operations. 4.7.2.  Ensure technician accountability and availability.  (T-2) 4.7.3.  Ensure  "clean"  areas  (determined  by  EM)  are  established  and  ready  to  support operations.  These include over-pressurized shelters and off site TFAs.  (T-2) 4.7.4.  Establish  expedient  means  to  disperse  resources  to  ACCAs,  shelters,  and  other mission essential locations.  Consider pre-positioning items based on coordination with EM. 4.7.5.  Coordinate  with  Intelligence,  CBRN  Control  Center  Emergency  Support  Function (ESF-5), and deployed commanders to determine ACBRN equipment wear requirements for sortie support. 4.7.6.  Ensure re-supply procedures are established and copies of deployed asset inventories, to include aircrew sizing information, are available.  (T-2) 4.7.7.  Ensure “bug-out” location and procedures are identified.  (T-2) 4.7.7.1.  Ensure  squadron  leadership  and  all  AFE  personnel  are  aware  of  alternate location  and  required  actions.    During  the  “bug-out”  planning  stage,  supervisors  must consider  mission  support  requirements,  mission  types  and  availability  of  personnel  as major  factors  to  continue  mission  support.    Disbursement  of  equipment  is  an  effective way to prepare for post bug-out operations.  (T-2) 4.7.8.  Ensure  coordination  is  established  with  Transportation  personnel  (AFSC  2T1X1)  to shuttle aircrew during ACCA operations.  (T-2) 4.7.9.  Ensure lines of communication are established between the EOC, Unit Control Center (UCC), ACCA Manager, collective facilities and other ACCA team members.  (T-2) 4.7.10.  Report  all  damage  and  contamination,  IAW  AFPAM  10-219  Volume  3,  Civil Engineer  Contingency  Response  and  Recovery  Procedures,  to  squadron  UCC  or  EOC personnel.  Include information on damage to AFE equipment, facilities, and personnel. 4.7.11.  Movement  of  aircrew  during  Post-Attack  (Dispersal  Period).    Mission  essential launch and recovery will resume as directed by the UCC (MISSION ESSENTIAL ONLY).  (T-2) 4.7.11.1.  If covered vehicles are not available, aircrew will remain in shelters or covered areas until conditions permit transportation.  If this is not possible, aircrew will wear the plastic  overcape  and  overboots  while  transiting  open  areas.    The  aircrew  overcape  will AFMAN11-301  22 JULY 2016   15  only be worn during the liquid dispersal period when aircrew movement requires them to move to/through an area that does not provide overhead protection.  (T-2) 4.7.11.2.  If  worn,  the  plastic  overboots  and  overcapes  will  not  be  removed  until  the aircrew member is ready to enter the aircraft, building or vehicle.  The unique entry and exit  procedures  for  each  aircraft  will  determine  the  specific  point  at  which  these  items will  be  removed.    Use  of  the  overcape  for  an  extended  period  may  contribute  to  heat stress,  increased  carbon  dioxide  or  static  buildup,  and  may  lead  to  decreased  aircrew performance.  Constant surveillance of personnel wearing the overcape is important.  (T-2) 4.7.11.3.  The  procedures  assume  maintenance  personnel  have  prepped  the  ladder, canopy, doors, hatches and seal areas for aircrew entry. 4.7.11.4.  Aircrew member will remove overcape.  (T-2) 4.7.11.5.  Crew chief secures the overcape for proper disposal. 4.7.11.6.  Crew  chief  will  remove  overboot  by  cutting  down  back  of  overboot;  the unprotected foot will be placed on the aircraft’s boarding ladder/step and not the ground.  (T-2) 4.7.11.7.  Crew  chief  will  then  secure  the  overboot  for  disposal,  repeat  with  other  foot.  (T-2) 4.7.11.8.  Reverse  the  above  procedures  after  the  aircraft  has  landed  to  aid  the pilot/aircrew with safely exiting the aircraft. 4.7.11.9.  Specific  procedures  must  be  established  between  AFE  and  maintenance  to ensure  overstock/resupply  of  overboots  and  overcapes  are  on  hand  for  continued operations.  (T-2)  Additionally, supplies of overboots, overcapes, and batteries may need to be placed in locations where crewmembers will be located.  Placement of these assets in these locations will ensure the crewmembers have replacements if items are damaged, lost, etc.  Ensure these considerations are part of all local exercises.  (T-2) 4.7.11.10.  Transportation  personnel  (AFSC  2T1X1)  are  responsible  for  transporting aircrew  to/from  aircraft.    Aircrew  will  be  transported  via  covered  vehicles  to  the maximum extent possible.  Transporting personnel will mitigate contamination by patting down  exposed  interior/exterior  of  vehicle  after  aircrew  exit.    To  aid  in  off  gassing, transport aircrew with windows open to the maximum extent possible (venting method).  (T-2) 4.7.11.11.  If  possible,  aircraft  canopies,  hatches,  and  doors  should  remain  closed  until immediately prior to aircrew entry.  They will be closed immediately after entry or strap-in and remain closed during all ground operations.  Limiting personnel on the aircraft is a key element of contamination avoidance.  (T-2) 4.7.12.  Contamination Control.  After the attack, the most  likely means of exposure comes from  physical  contact  with  objects  that  were  exposed  during  the  attack.    All  personnel  will remain aware of the possible presence of contamination and avoid unnecessary contact with any surface.  (T-2)   16  AFMAN11-301  22 JULY 2016 4.7.13.  ACCA  Manager  directs  the  preparation  of  the  ACCA  for  aircrew  personnel  and equipment,  as  directed  by  the  EOC.    The  manager  will  use  Attachment  3  to  guide  ACCA operations and the following paragraphs for required manpower to process aircrew members through  the  ACCA.    NOTE:    Utilize  AFI  11-301  Volume  3  for  specific  UTC  tasking guidance and total UTC manpower requirements to sustain ACBRN operations.  (T-2) 4.7.13.1.  The ACCA Manager has overall authority for the entire ACCA; however, in an ideal situation they will appoint one of the ACCA attendants to oversee the Vapor Hazard Area  (VHA)  while  the  manager  is  focused  on  the  Contact  Hazard  Area  (CHA).    This approach will provide the maximum level of supervisory attention to each critical part of the ACCA.  (T-2) 4.7.13.2.  For  optimum  aircrew  processing,  the  ACCA  is  designed  for  eleven  AFE personnel (nine AFE Station Attendants, one ACCA Manager, and one VHA Supervisor).  This  manpower  standard  is  based  on  processing  one  aircrew  at  a  time  for  each  station, and is necessary to support the dynamic nature of ACCA operations. 4.7.13.2.1.  If  the  requirement  exists  to  process  two  aircrew  simultaneously  at  each station, the manning requirement would double at each station. 4.7.14.  The ACCA Manager will report start and completion of ACCA processing to UCC or  EOC  (as  required/capable).    In  addition,  the  ACCA  Manager  will  be  prepared  to  report additional information as requested (suspected contamination, names of aircrew, etc.).  (T-2) 4.7.15.  Coordinate  security  of  the  ACCA  with  Security  Forces  as  directed  by  the  base support plan/EM.  Communicate any threat to security personnel, EOC and the UCC. 4.7.16.  Placards for ACCA operations can be obtained from the USAF AFE SharePoint®. AFMAN11-301  22 JULY 2016   17  Chapter 5 AIRCREW CONTAMINATION CONTROL AREA (ACCA) OPERATIONS 5.1.  Purpose.  The guidance contained in this chapter identifies coordination and procedures for ACCA  Managers  as  well  as  general  ACCA  information.    The  primary  focus  of  AFE  is  to generate  aircrew  to  conduct  operations  in  a  CBRN  environment.    AFE  procedures  include recognizing vulnerabilities and opportunities to protect personnel, working safely and effectively in  a  contaminated  environment,  and  understanding  and  operating  an  ACCA.    Accomplish preparatory  and  planning  actions  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  a  CBRN  environment  on  the  AFE function.  Identify preparatory actions by performing an operating location vulnerability analysis.  This  analysis  should  consider  the  types  and  effectiveness  of  available  shelters,  possible  time required in shelters, and equipment needs. 5.1.1.  The purpose of the ACCA is  to  provide contamination  mitigation and provisions for processing  aircrew  into  a  TFA.                          NOTE:    Units  shall  conduct/manage  ACCA operations until an appointed 9ALCW UTC arrives.  The AFE Superintendent shall maintain control of the 9ALCW UTC personnel and equipment.  (T-2) 5.2.  ACCA. 5.2.1.  Aircrew.    All  personnel  performing  flight  duties  wearing  ACBRN  equipment  are aircrew.    There  are  many  specialties/configurations  associated  with  flight  duties;  including Helicopter, Battlefield Airmen, Fighter, Mobility Platform Aircrew, and Aeromedical.  Some of  these  configurations  do  include  use  of  the  Joint  Service  Lightweight  Integrated  Suit Technology  (JSLIST)  and  Joint  Service  General  Purpose  Mask  (JSGPM).    The  procedures are written to support any configuration that may show up for processing at the ACCA. 5.2.1.1.  Sister Services.  All personnel performing flight duties in ACBRN equipment, as mentioned above, from other US services and departments are also considered aircrew. 5.2.1.2.  Foreign  Military  Aircrew.    AFE  shall  be  prepared  to  process  all  of  the specialties/configurations  listed  above  from  partnered  foreign  militaries.    Although  the configurations used in foreign militaries are quite different from DoD equipment, annual NATO Exercise TOXIC TRIP has proven AFE procedures, as written, can support any of these configurations.  (T-2) 5.2.1.3.  AFE.  AFE personnel will ensure plans are developed with CE/EM to determine how  to  process  ACCA  Manager/s  and  attendants.    Plans  may  evolve  based  on  the decision to destroy, repack, or leave the ACCA assembled.  (T-2) 5.2.1.4.  Mission  Requirements.    ACCA  is  for  the  processing  of  aircrew  only;  all  other personnel will be processed through the CCA by CE/EM.  (T-2) 5.2.2.  The  ACCA  Manager  will  obtain  as  much  information  from  outside  agencies  as possible  to  establish  an  effective  and  efficient  ACCA  process  and  re-supply.    The  ACCA manager will work closely with EM to ensure support agencies are prepared to assist ACCA operations to solidify the success of the ACCA.  (T-2) 5.2.3.  For  open  air  ACCAs,  a  minimum  spacing  requirement  of  10  yards  between  stations will be maintained at all times.  However, ACCA Managers may consult with EM personnel   18  AFMAN11-301  22 JULY 2016 regarding  spacing  adjustments  when  location  or  number  of  aircrew  processing  impact operational capacity.  (T-2) 5.2.4.  ACCA  processing.    The  ACCA  placards  are  designed  to  provide  attendants with  the general intent of associated steps, as opposed to specific steps for every configuration.  Such methodology  places  emphasis  on  the  attendant’s  ability  to  manage  each  station  effectively through an increased awareness of the flight equipment they may encounter (e.g. three glove system versus some foreign one glove systems).  Attendants are encouraged to communicate with aircrew and shelter manager when processing unfamiliar flight equipment. 5.2.5.  Contact Hazard Area (CHA).  Is a defined room, space, or area within the boundary of the  ACCA  to  identify  and  contain  contact  hazards.    Use  absorbent  materials  to  contain  the chemical,  biological,  or  radiological  hazard  and  use  chlorine  solutions  to  mitigate  the chemical or biological agents. 5.2.6.  CHA/VHA  Transition  Point.    The  location  within  the  ACCA  where  aircrew  moves from the CHA into the VHA.  At this transition point, an identifiable demarcation line shall be used to differentiate the CHA and VHA.  (T-2) 5.2.7.  Vapor  Hazard  Area  (VHA).    Is  where  only  the  possibility  of  a  vapor  or  inhalation hazard exists.  The purpose of a VHA is to separate all airborne hazards before they process into a TFA.  Over-pressurized systems use vapor locks to prevent off-gassing hazards from getting any further into the shelter.  In open-air processing, the VHA is a large open space.  This assists in reducing vapors.  The further a crewmember travels and the larger the volume of air flow in the VHA, the greater the contamination diminishing effect. 5.2.8.  TFA.  This area should not contain a hazard.  While operating in this area, there is no need for respirators or protective clothing.  In open-air processing, however, locate the TFA main personnel rest  area outside the defined boundary of the ACCA and at least 200 yards away.    Shifting  wind  direction  or  the  accumulation  of  contaminated  materials,  (potential hazard effects from off-gassing or agent re-suspension), or the noise associated with general ACCA  operations,  necessitates  the  need  for  locating  the  TFA  away  from  the  ACCA  in  an open-air  environment.    With  over-pressurized  buildings,  the  TFA  will  be  determined  based on the system.  (T-2) 5.2.8.1.  Establishing  the  TFA.    Deployed  Superintendents  shall  have  awareness  of  the TFA  location,  through  coordination  with  EM  and  wing  leadership;  to  ensure  processes are  established  with  Transportation  personnel  (AFSC  2T1X1)  for  aircrew  exiting  the ACCA.  (T-2) 5.2.9.  Entry and Exit Control Points (ECP).  The ACCA entry point is located at Station 1, and  the  exit  point  is  located  at  Station  9,  thus  ensuring  an  effective  traffic  flow.    Establish ECP  procedures  to  document  attendance,  exposure,  and  historical  aspects  of  ACCA operations. 5.3.  ACCA  Planning.  EOC  shall  establish  open-air  ACCA  and  TFA  facilities/processes through EM and wing leadership coordination, with adequate lead-time prior to a CBRNE threat.  AFE personnel shall be effectively prepared for rapid repositioning and multi-place operations.  (T-2) AFMAN11-301  22 JULY 2016   19  5.3.1.  All aircrew arriving at the ACCA are presumed contaminated, and will be processed thru the ACCA.  (T-2) 5.3.2.  Aircrew  returning  from  a  contaminated  area  shall  notify  commanders  of  possible contamination.   Commanders  shall  then  advise  AFE  personnel  to  initiate  ACCA decontamination procedures.  (T-2) 5.3.3.  Rapidly  changing  conditions,  alarm  postures,  mission  requirements,  CBRN  threat analysis,  Intelligence  information,  24-hour  a  day  operations,  inspection  and  maintenance workloads, will all affect AFE’s ability to plan and sustain ACCA operations. 5.3.4.  Aircrew Preparation.  Prior to mission step, aircrew must be briefed that all items in their  possession  will  be  surrendered  and  may  be  destroyed  upon  processing  through  an ACCA.  This can be mitigated by leaving flight materials (i.e., maps, data transfer case, etc.) in  the  aircraft.    Classified  material  will  be  separately  stored  at  ACCA  until  the  appropriate personnel retrieve them.  (T-2) 5.4.  ACCA  Manager.  The  Manager  is  the  focal  point  for  conducting  ACCA  operations,  and shall be the most qualified AFE individual per shift.  The ACCA Manager shall coordinate with EM  and  the  CBRN  Control  Center  concerning  ACCA  operations.    For  responsibilities,  see Attachment 2, ACCA Managers Actions.  (T-2) 5.4.1.  Duties included, but are not limited to, site location selection and management, AFE technician  Station  assignments,  ensuring  ACCA  is  fully  supplied,  monitoring  work/rest cycles,  up  channeling  status  to  Chain  of  Command  (CoC),  and  assisting  attendants  as necessary.  The Manager shall also coordinate waste disposal with EM, medical aid with first responders and classified material handling with Intelligence.  (T-2) 5.4.2.  ACCA  Manager  duty  location.    Within  ideal  manning  conditions,  there  will  be  a Manager  assigned  to  both  the  CHA  and  VHA.    During  solo  Manager  Operations,  the Manager  will  remain  in  the  CHA,  and  communicate  with  the  VHA  attendant  at  the demarcation line (station 6).  (T-2) 5.4.3.  Processing classified material.  The ACCA Manager shall pre-coordinate with Intel to determine  the  extent  and  level  of  possible  classified  materials,  and  how  to  mitigate  the amount brought to the ACCA.  When possible, the classified material owners shall retrieve it at  the  ACCA  ECP  or  at  the  aircraft.    The  Manager  shall  not  prevent  aircrew  arriving  with classified material from processing.  Station 1 attendant shall place the material in a lockable container (at the appropriate step) and secure the container until the owner can take positive control.  (T-2) 5.4.4.  Handling sick/contaminated personnel.  First Responders will be notified upon initial signs  of  suspected  personnel.    First  Aid/Buddy  Care  shall  be  administered  while  First Responders  are  in  route.    Pre-coordination  with  medical  personnel  on  the  process  of transferring contaminated personnel will expedite their medical care.  (T-2) 5.4.5.  Handling  contaminated/possibly  contaminated  flight  equipment.    Since  detection capabilities  are  limited,  all  processed  items  will  be  treated  as  contaminated.    Coordination with EM is imperative to determine procedures to segregate items (e.g. munitions, classified, combustible)  in  a  holding  area  for  disposal.    AFE  shall  develop  plans  to  replace  discarded flight equipment to meet mission requirements.  (T-2)   20  AFMAN11-301  22 JULY 2016 5.4.6.  After the last aircrew processes through the ACCA, the ACCA Manager will: 5.4.6.1.  Ensure  classified  materials  have  been  collected  and  relinquished  to  the  owning agency.  (T-2) 5.4.6.2.  Through  coordinated  efforts  with  EM,  determine  whether  the  ACCA  will  be packed  back  into  storage  for  future  use,  or  identified  as  contaminated  waste  and destroyed.  (T-2) 5.4.6.3.  Ensure  plans  are  developed  with  EM  to  determine  how  to  process  ACCA Manager and attendants.  Plans may evolve based on the decision to destroy, repack, or leave the ACCA assembled.  (T-2) 5.5.  General ACCA Processing Procedures. 5.5.1.  Detailed training and procedures are located on the USAF AFE SharePoint®.  Ensure guidance is incorporated into Technician Training prior to ACCA set-up in order to provide adequate and effective processing.  (T-2) 5.5.2.  Processing  placards.    Units  may  print  placards  in  color  with  large  font  to  assist readability.  Placards provide guidance for the attendant and aircrew during processing, while aiding foreign aircrew with the general intent of each station. 5.5.2.1.  Pictograms  serve  as  a  quick  reference  to  identify  equipment  removed  at  each station  and  are  invaluable  during  multi-national  ACCA  efforts.    During  multi-national combat operations, AFE technicians cannot assume they will be tasked to only assist US personnel. 5.5.3.  SOCKS, CHEMICAL PROTECTIVE (500 EA. PER ROLL) NSN 8415-01-040-3169 or  equivalent.    These  socks  (also  known  as  tube  socks)  will  be  required  for  use  throughout the ACCA.  (T-2) 5.5.3.1.  At  a  minimum,  socks  will  be  placed  on  the  aircrew’s  feet  when  their  boot  is removed.  However, socks may be used to protect hands if the aircrew’s glove comes off, or may be used by the attendant as a barrier between their hands and a contaminated item.

The  protection  of Aircrew  members  and  their  aircraft  is  of  utmost  importance  during  attack  situations.    The enemy’s  use  of  CBRN  agents  has  the  potential  to  degrade  flight  operations  unless  aircraft maintenance  and  aircrew  members  are  well  trained.    Effective  contamination  avoidance measures are implemented, and the installation has proactive attack response procedures in place regarding the protection of aircraft. 6.1.1.  Use of ACBRN  ensemble is  directed by the installation Command and Control (C2) based  on  the  MOPP.    As  required,  ACBRN  ensemble  is  either  worn  or  available  in  the  D-Bag,  depending  on  the  current  threat.    The  ACBRN  ensemble  provides  limited  protection against liquid agent.  ACBRN ensemble is only intended for flying operations.  Aircrew will wear  the  GCE  during  non-flying  operations  (to  include  aircrew  not  on  the  flying  schedule, performing pre-fight duties for stepping aircrew).  Aircrew will be aware of CCA and ACCA processing procedures for both ACBRN ensemble and GCE.  (T-2) 6.1.2.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  aircrew  to  deploy  with  their  GCE  for  use  in  the  AOR. AFE shall not be responsible for maintaining GCE issued to aircrew.  (T-2) 6.2.  ACBRN Ensembles. 6.2.1.  AFI 11-301 Volume 2 establishes the basis-of-issue for the different types of ACBRN ensemble authorized/issued/maintained to USAF aircrew. 6.2.2.  Sister & Foreign Services ACBRN Ensembles.  AFE must be prepared to accept and safely  process  all  US  aircrew/operators.    Although  there  may  be  many  different  ensembles across the services, the contamination mitigation techniques in this manual are sufficient to address all of them.  (T-2) 6.3.  ACBRN  Equipment  Donning  Procedures.  ACBRN  ensembles  should  be  donned  IAW applicable  guidance  for  the  specific  type  of  equipment.    A  donning  procedures  guide  can  be found at the USAF AFE SharePoint® site.  This guide is provided to aid units in developing a donning checklist.  Information found in technical orders takes precedence.           NOTE:  The Common Access Card (CAC) must be placed UNDER the CB protective layer.  This will aid in keeping it clean.  (T-2) 6.3.1.  While  typical  donning  procedures  use  common  AFE  terms  (i.e.,  AERP),  units  may tailor donning procedures to meet the needs of the aircrew (e.g. don the M50/MBU-13/P in lieu of the AERP mask). 6.3.2.  The  donning  guide  assumes  the  aircrew  member  is  wearing  their  personal  socks, underwear, and t-shirt. 6.3.3.  References to the CWU-66/P or Coverall are made to indicate the CB protective layer.  If JPACE/JSLIST (or equivalent) is used, apply the procedures similarly. 6.3.4.  To  provide  maximum  protection,  the  intent  of  the  donning  order  given  should  be followed.   22  AFMAN11-301  22 JULY 2016 6.3.5.  The  use  of  CWU-43/P  and  CWU-44/P  aramid  underwear  (or  equivalent  authorized underwear) is authorized during extremely cold weather and may be used in lieu of the cotton underwear. 6.4.  Personal Contamination Mitigation. 6.4.1.  Personal  Contamination  Mitigation  is  vital.    Accomplish  personal  contamination mitigation  as  soon  as  contamination  is  present  or  suspected.    Take  appropriate  response actions, include  accomplishing  self-aid  and  buddy  care  checks  for  IPE/AFE contamination.  Use M295 decontamination kits (or equivalent) as required. to 6.4.2.  When  aircrew  identify  contamination  is  present,  they  must  immediately  accomplish personal  decontamination  procedures,  report  the  presence  of  contamination  to  the  UCC  or EOC, and plan to process through an ACCA when appropriate.
