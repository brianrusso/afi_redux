The mission of the Air Force Art Program (AFAP) is to preserve a visual record of the Air Force experience in operations, events, and  other  activities  and  make  artworks  available  to  the  broadest  audience  possible.  AFTAP provide  a  guidance  for  all  Air  Force  owned  artwork  and  owns,  administers,  and  manages  a central  collection  of  artwork  known  as  the  Air  Force  Art  Collection.    The  artwork  within  the inventory also serves as an educational medium, informing the military and civilian communities of  Air  Force  Roles  and  Missions,  history,  and  engender  context  of  both  past  and  present.  The Collection  is  centrally  administered  at  Headquarters  Air  Force.  Its  holdings  are  exhibited  to inform  internal  and  external  audiences  about  Air  Force  missions  and  capabilities.  Although predominately  paintings,  the  collection  also  contains  drawings,  textile  art,  sketches,  and sculptures. The Air Force Art Collection does not include artifacts and other historical property covered by AFI 84-103, U.S. Air Force Heritage Program. 1.1.1.

(T-2).  AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 5 1.4.4.  Coordination of Commander requests for professional artists to visit their installations under  the  auspices  of  the  AFAP.  Send  such  requests  with  a  description  of  the  planned activities to the AFAP. AFAP will determine whether funds are available before coordinating the activities planned for the artist(s) visit.(T-1). 1.4.5.  Field  commands  and  units  may  arrange  for  artists  to  visit  their  installations independently of the AFAP administered visitations program. AFAP is not obligated to fund these visits. 1.4.6.  When  an  artist  or  owner  donates  an  original  artwork  portraying  the  Air  Force  or  a piece  of  previously  unregistered  art  portraying  the  Air  Force  is  discovered,  send  AFAP  an image (e.g., a negative, transparency or electronic image). This helps to assess it for possible inclusion  in  the  Air  Force  Art  Collection.  AFAP  reserves  the  right  to  reject  a  submitted artwork. If the artwork is in color, the reproduction must also be in color. AFAP also obtains biographical  information  about  the  artist  and  background  about  the  artwork.  2.2.5.  Send AFAP a copy of the appointment memorandum with their address and phone number. 1.5.  Accountable  Officer  Responsibilities.  Commanders  or  directors  of  organizations authorized to display original artworks of the Air Force Art Collection must designate by a DD Form 577 (Appointment/Termination Record – Authorized Signature) an accountable officer as custodian of artwork prior to any selection of artwork. (T-1). Accountable officers: 1.5.1.  Obtain a signed loan agreement at the time of the loan accepting responsibility of the artwork and forward a copy of the agreement and inventory to AFAP. (T-1). 1.5.2.  Serve  as  their  organization’s  point  of  contact  for  requesting  or  returning  artwork  to AFAP. The requesting agency or organization must have funds available to pay for packing and shipping of artwork selected.  Accountable officers will contact AFAP to return artworks no longer wanted.(T-1). Again, the agency or organization will pay for packing and shipping back to AFAP.  For both shipping and receiving artwork AFAP will provide the accountable officer  an  updated  inventory.  The  organization  returning  the  artwork  will  incur  shipment costs. 1.5.3.

Make certain the accession number entered on each artwork matches the number on the inventory printout. 1.5.5.4.  Ensure that an identification tag is on the front of the artwork. It will include the title, artist, accession number, and Property of the Air Force Art Program. 1.5.5.5.  Annotate  in  ink  on  the  inventory  listing  any  discrepancies  or  changes  noted about the artwork or frame (See Paragraph 2.3.3, for loss, theft, or damaged procedures). 6 AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 1.5.5.6.  Sign the last page of the inventory to acknowledge continued responsibility for the artworks listed and return one signed copy to SAF/AAO,  1435 Air Force Pentagon, Room  5D855,Washington  DC  20330-1435  or  fax  a  copy  to  (703)  697-6531,  DSN  227. Call  (703)  697-6629,  DSN  227  to  confirm  receipt  of  the  fax.  Call  before  emailing  an inventory. 1.5.5.7.  Arrange the appointments of new accountable officers when necessary including when art custodian PCS, PCA, or when organizations reorganize.(T-2). 1.5.5.8.  The  commander  appoints  additional  on-site  personnel  to  help  oversee  artworks displayed at dispersed locations. 1.6.  Other Artwork.  Organizations that acquire or maintain works of art not accepted into the Air Force Art Collection must comply with AFI 51-601. AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 7 Chapter 2 MANAGEMENT OF AIR FORCE ART 2.1.  Acquiring  Artwork  .    The  AFAP  acquires  most  of  the  art  in  the  Air  Force  through donations on invitational orders from the Secretary of the Air Force. Historically official portraits of the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force were commissioned as a result of competitive bidding, however the program no longer commissions artwork of any type. Normally artists, corporations, associations, heirs, or individuals donate art  to  the Air Force, in accordance with AFI 51-601. 2.1.1.  The AFAP does send artists to visit military and humanitarian locations where the AF is  involved  to  document  activities.    While  artists  are  not  required  to  provide  paintings  in exchange for traveling on a documentation trip, a trip report describing the amenability of the trip  and  mission  to  the  creation  of  art  is  required.  The  attachment  of  photographs  and/or reference sketches to these reports is strongly recommended. 2.1.2.  The  art  program  contacts  artists  through  various  illustrator  and  aviation  art associations. The associations act as juries to ensure the highest quality and accuracy of art is donated to the program. The AFAP has the authority to not accept the art into the collection. 2.1.3.  To merit acceptance into the Air Force Art Collection, an  artwork must contribute to the  historical  significance  of  the  collection  (see  Paragraph  1.1)  and  meet  recognized professional  standards.  AFAP  determines  if  artworks  meet  these  standards  and  controls  all accessioning  of  artwork  into  the  program.  When  an  artist  or  owner  donates  an  original artwork, AFAP processes the gift for Secretary of the Air Force acceptance. This process has been delegated to the Administrative Assistant from the Secretary of the Air Force. 2.1.4.  For  all  artwork,  AFAP  reserves  the  right  to  reject  a  submitted  artwork.  Donated artwork will follow the requirements and procedures for conditional and unconditional gifts, as appropriate, outlined in AFI 51-601. Artwork, like all other gifts accepted per AFI 51-601, necessitate the owner giving up all title and rights to the donated property. All artwork should be  accompany  by  an  offer  letter  (see  Attachment  1).  If  a  piece  of  donated  artwork  is  not accepted into the AFAP by SAF/AAO, installation commanders may still be able to  accept the gift for their local use pursuant to AFI 51-601. If both a local command and AFAP reject the gift, the artwork will be returned to the artist. 2.1.5.  MAJCOM commanders, or their designees, and commanders of FOAs and DRUs may accept artwork per to AFI 51-601, within the limits of delegated authority. When an artist or owner  donates  an  original  artwork  portraying  the  Air  Force,  or  a  piece  of  previously unregistered  art  portraying  the  Air  Force  is  discovered,  MAJCOM/HO  will  send  AFAP  a reproducible image (e.g., a jpeg, negative, transparency or electronic image) to help assess it for  possible  inclusion  into  the  Collection.  If  the  artwork  is  in  color,  the  reproduction  must also be in color. AFAP also requires biographical information on the artist and background of the artwork. 2.1.6.  If  AFAP  accepts  an  item  donated  to  a  field  organization  into  the  Air  Force  Art Collection, the organization may keep possession of it locally if desired and agreed upon by AFAP.  If  a  donated  artwork’s  value  exceeds  that  authorized  for  acceptance  in  the  field, AFAP processes the gift for the Secretary of the Air Force’s acceptance. 8 AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 2.1.7.  Artwork accepted as gifts and not included in the Air Force Art Collection as well as those  commissioned  by  field  organizations,  are  controlled  and  accounted  for  locally  (see Paragraph 1.6). 2.2.  Accessioning  and  Cataloging  .    All  artwork  accepted  into  the  AF  art  program  will  be given an accession number and cataloged into the web based database. The database owners are the principals in the program at the Pentagon location. The Pentagon office may make additions, modifications,  and  deletions  regardless  of  the  artwork’s  location.  However,  delegates  at MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs do have access to the system. The delegates are limited to making changes to the database for their location only. 2.2.1.  Each piece of artwork is given an accession number based on when it was input in the database, not when it was painted. The format for the unique accession number is year first, followed by when it was cataloged into the system. For example, 2003.005 shows that AFAP cataloged the artwork in 2003 and it was the fifth item accessioned that year. An older form of accession number which has been changed in the database but which may still appear on the artwork is  number accessioned followed by the  year,  e.g. 105.57. The new format  (and the way it would appear in the database) would be 1957.105  – the 105th item catalogued in 1957. Whenever the old  format appears on the painting, it should be replaced with the new format. Accountable officers are authorized to perform this task in the field. 2.2.2.  Each  piece  of  artwork  will  have  an  identification  label  on  the  front  of  it  (whenever possible) with the accession number, title, artist, and Property of the United States Air Force. The  identification  labels  will  be  1  inch  tall  and  5  inches  long.  The  labels  may  be  metal  or plastic and will be affixed with double sided tape. Labels will be provided by AFAP. 2.2.3.  When  cataloging  the  document,  the  individual  will  put  the  unique  accession  number on  the  back  lower  left  and  lower  right  sides  of  the  item  in  script  at  least  three  inches  tall. They will also adhere on the back (or in the case of sculptures in an inconspicuous location) of the artwork warning stickers that say: “Do Not Move without Notifying the Air Force Art Program, 703-697-6229.” See Attachment 2 for a copy of the sticker. 2.2.4.  Cataloging  information  includes  the  accession  number,  the  name  of  the  artist,  the location  of  the  art  work,  and  a  point  of  contact,  It  also  includes  any  relevant  shipping information, the medium, the size (framed and unframed), signature information, Copyright information,  the  thumbnail  picture,  a  controlled  vocabulary  category,  the  date  input,  a description of the artwork, and the estimated value of the artwork (default value is $2,000). In  addition,  the  database  includes  information  about  damage,  maintenance,  restoration,  and conservation activities. 2.2.5.  Biographical  information  is  also  included  in  the  database  and  should  be  updated periodically.  Biographical  updates  will  routinely  occur  prior to  major  Air  Force Presentations, historically held biennially. 2.2.6.  Any  time  that  the  artwork  is  moved,  its  new  location  must  be  updated  into  the database. At this time, it is advisable to put accession numbers in current format and current AFAP  stickers  on  the  back  of  the  painting  and  annotate  whether  the  painting  needs restoration or not.  AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 9 2.3.  Control  of Artwork  . The function of the program is to ensure as broad dissemination of Air  Force  artwork  as  possible  within  its  span  of  control.  Availability  must  be  balanced  with stewardship of the art. AFAP does this first by lending its artwork to MAJCOMs, DRUs, FOAs, and civilian installations while balancing it with annual audits through inventories. 2.3.1.  Loaning Air Force Art.  Since the Air Force Art Collection is limited, its holdings can be exhibited only in  officially designated public  access  areas, such  as offices and reception areas. AFAP will not loan artworks indefinitely or long-term to private individuals or private organizations,  or  for  display  in  private  quarters.  Certain  General  Officers  Quarters  are eligible for loans. Borrowers must return artworks to AFAP in the same condition as loaned, without  alterations.  They  will  not  remove  artworks  from  their  frames.  Only  AFAP  will arrange for cleaning, repairing, or restoring artworks. The following locations are eligible for loans from the collection: 2.3.1.1.  The offices of the Secretary of Defense, including Assistant Secretaries. 2.3.1.2.  The offices of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 2.3.1.3.  The offices of the Secretary of the Air Force, including the Under Secretary and Assistant Secretaries. 2.3.1.4.  The offices of the Air Force Chief of Staff, Vice Chief of Staff, Assistant Vice-Chief of Staff and all HAF offices. 2.3.1.5.  The offices of Deputy Chiefs of Staff and Assistant Chiefs of Staff. 2.3.1.6.  The offices of the Chief of Air Force Reserve. 2.3.1.7.  The offices of the Air National Guard Director. 2.3.1.8.  The offices and headquarters of MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders. 2.3.1.9.  MAJCOMs  reserve  the  right  to  request  waivers  to  allow  Numbered  Air  Force Headquarters and wings to display art. AFAP will render final approval of request. 2.3.1.10.  Public  exhibit  areas  maintained  at  the  Pentagon,  the  National  Museum  of  the USAF, the Air Force Academy, and Air Force Field Museums. 2.3.1.11.  The  official  residences  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  the  Secretary  of  the  Air Force, the Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, the Air Force Chief of Staff, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force and the Chief Master Sargent of the Air Force. 2.3.1.12.  The National Air and Space Museum (NASM), other government agencies and public exhibits as deemed appropriate by AFAP. 2.3.1.13.  Occasionally,  AFAP  will  support  single-theme  exhibits  in  military  or  civilian settings. If artworks must be withdrawn for loan to support an exhibit, AFAP will try to provide prior notice and pay for return shipments. 2.3.2.  Inventory.  Previously  AFAP  and  its  designated  custodians  would  conduct  a  yearly inventory of all artwork.   Upon movement  of any  artwork it is the responsibility of AFAP and its designated custodians to update the information in the database. This was previously done by manually entering the information into the database.  Now, with the introduction of passive  RFID  chips  which  are  placed  on  each  piece  of  art,  inventory  proceeds  quicker  and 10 AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 more  accurately.  Currently  AFAP  conducts  an  annual  inventory  of  the  Air  Force  Art Collection.  AFAP  will  provide  accountable  officers  a  complete  inventory  of  all  artwork assigned  to  their  account.  Accountable  officers  and  AFAP  will  confer  to  resolve  any discrepancies. Accountable officers will receive annually a listing of Air Force Art assigned to them. They will have 30 days from receipt of the inventory to complete it. Generally this should be completed by  the end of each fiscal  year—specifically by September 30, of each year.    If  an  extension  is  required,  they  will  notify  the  AFAP  with  an  estimated  date  of completion. With the assistance of accountable officers, a physical inventory is conducted to: 2.3.2.1.  All  commands,  DRUs,  and  FOAs  will  use  the  AF  art  database  as  the  official record for the location and assignment of Air Force Art. 2.3.2.2.  Verify the artworks current location and condition. 2.3.2.3.  Ensure “Do Not Remove Without Notifying AFAPO” stickers and the accession numbers  (approximately  2-3  inches  tall  using  a  visible  marker)  are  affixed  on  the  back lower right and left corner of each painting. 2.3.2.4.  Ensure that an identification label is on the front of each piece of artwork. 2.3.2.5.  Make certain the accession number entered on each artwork matches the number on the inventory printout. 2.3.2.6.  Annotate  in  ink  on  the  inventory  listing  any  discrepancies  or  changes  noted about the artwork or frame (See Paragraph 2.3.3 for loss, theft, or damaged procedures). 2.3.2.7.  Verify the last page of each inventory/loan agreement is signed to acknowledge continued  responsibility  for  the  artwork  listed  on  loan.  The  inventory  is  sent  to  AFAP, 1435 Air Force Pentagon, Room 5D855, Washington DC 20330-1435. 2.3.2.8.  All  commands,  DRUs,  and  FOAs  will  use  the  AF  art  database  to  reconcile survey results. AFAP is responsible for the final  updating  of records to include deletion of lost, stolen, or damaged artwork. 2.3.3.  Lost, Stolen or Damaged Artwork.  The Air Force Art Collection contains valuable property and is subject to control and monitoring as an Inspector General (IG) special interest item. 2.3.3.1.  If theft or vandalism is suspected, immediately contact security forces as well as the organization’s accountable officer and AFAP. 2.3.3.2.  Immediately report loss or damage to an Air Force Art Collection artwork to the organization’s accountable officer, who must promptly notify AFAP. Identify the artwork by  its  title,  artist,  and  accession  number,  and  give  all  circumstances  known  about  the artwork’s disappearance or damage. 2.3.3.3.  AFAP  provides  law  enforcement  agencies  images  and  descriptions  of  the artwork needed to conduct an investigation. 2.3.3.4.  The  accountable  officer  is  responsible  for  the  lost,  stolen,  or  damaged  artwork and  must  review  the  circumstances,  complete  a  written  Report  of  Survey  (ROS),  and forward  the  report  to  AFAP  within  the  allotted  time  as  outlined  in  AFMAN  23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property. (T-1). AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 11 2.3.3.5.  AFAP will arrange for repairing and restoring damaged artworks. 2.3.3.6.  In  the  event  the  artwork  is  stolen  or  irreparably  damaged,  AFAP  will  delete  it from  the  active  file.  If  the  artwork  is  lost,  it  will  remain  visible  in  the  database  in  the event that the item is located eventually. It will be annotated in the comments line that it has been lost, misplaced, or stolen. 2.4.  Report  of  Survey  (ROS).  Air  Force  artwork  is  considered  controlled  inventory.  AFI  23-111,  Material  of  Government  Property  in  Possession  of  the  Air  Force,  has  been  extensively revised  to  require  that  property  custodians  be  appointed  in  writing  by  a  Wing  or  Group Commander  (or  equivalent)  for  managing  government  property.    Please  refer  to  AFMAN  23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property, for what to do when artwork is lost, unaccounted for,  damaged  beyond  repair  or  stolen.    AFMAN  23-220,  Chapter  4,  General  Procedures  for Processing a ROS (DD FORM 200) outlines the procedures to take when filling out an ROS is necessary.    See  Attachment  3  and  “Air  Force  Art  Collection  Reports  of  Survey  Authorities” letter. 2.5.  Display  and  Storage.  Artwork  is  a  valuable  asset  and  resource  and  must,  therefore,  be displayed  and  stored  in  accordance  with  established  art  conservation  guidelines.  These guidelines, to include avoiding temperature and humidity extremes, exposure to ultraviolet light, and  safe  transfer  of  artwork  from  one  location  to  another  (including  the  proper  wrapping  of artwork) will be reviewed within AFAP , MAJCOMs, and DRUs periodically.  This will reflect any recommendations that may have been made by art conservators and restorers. Accountable officers and AFAP are expected to use reasonable care in the display and storage of items. See Paragraph 1.3.4.2 and 1.3.4.3 for examples.(T-1). 2.6.  Artist Visits to Air Force Activities.  Professional artists who visit Air Force installations generally create artwork for the Air Force Art Collection. Unless specifically commissioned by a local  organization  (see  Paragraph  2.7.4),  artists  are  not  contractually  required  to  produce  or donate artwork as a precondition to visit an installation. 2.6.1.  AFAP schedules trips for artists who create artworks for the Air Force Art Collection. 2.6.2.  Prior  to  finalization  of  an  artist’s  trip,  AFAP  coordinates  with  an  appropriate  art society to select an artist or identify an independent artist. Coordination is then made with the MAJCOM, FOA or DRU History Office as appropriate for visits to subordinate units within their  command.  In  addition,  AFAP  coordinates  with  Public  Affairs  Officers  (PAO)  as appropriate.  Artists  travel  on  invitational  travel  orders  usually  in  an  equivalent  grade  of  O-6/GS-15. 2.6.3.  AFAP  coordinates  with  base  personnel  identified  to  assist  with  the  artist  visit  for quarters,  local  transportation,  and  necessary  clearances  for  artists  to  sketch  or  photograph base activities. 2.6.4.  AFAP  is  not  obligated  to  fund  field  command  and  unit  artist  visit  requests independently from the program’s activities.    12 AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 2.7.  Value  of  Artworks.  Accepting  a  work  of  art  entails  responsibility  for  controlling  and reporting it as an asset of the organization and, in some cases, reporting a donation to the Internal Revenue  Service  (IRS)  in  accordance  with  the  US  Code  Title  26  (Internal  Revenue  Code). Organizations  must  record  any  artwork  valued  at  any  value  at  the  time  the  Air  Force  takes custody.(T-1). AFAP will determine the fair market value of an artwork as follows: 2.7.1.  If an artist or other owner donates an artwork without using it for a tax deduction, its monetary value is based on the costs of travel, the materials used, and time spent creating the artwork  (which  will  vary  depending  on  the  artist’s  status  in  the  art  world).  These  must  be stated in the letter or equivalent instrument offering the work to the Air Force. 2.7.2.  If the artist or owner intends to claim the value of a donated artwork as a tax deduction value of $250 or more, a qualified professional appraisal must accompany the letter of offer. The  donor  organization  must  ascertain  that  the  appraisal  presents  all  relevant  facts  as identified  in  the  Standard  Federal  Tax  Reports  (SFTR)  and  provide  the  IRS  with  a contemporaneous written acknowledgment of its appraised value. 2.7.3.  If a donated artwork was previously purchased or commissioned by a corporation or person,  the  donation  letter  should  identify  the  original  purchase  price  and  date.  If  recently purchased, this price will be the fair market value (if the cost is within reason and there is no appearance of intent to defraud). If bought several years ago, an appraisal may be needed to set the current value. 2.7.4.  If an organization requests an artist visit an installation to create an artwork, this may constitute a valid commission (procurement contract) for the artist’s services. In this case, an agreed-upon  price  would  be  used  as  the  cost  basis  for  the  artwork.  If  the  artist  agrees  to accept only travel, transportation, lodging and/or per diem, the value of the artwork will be based  on  these  items  plus  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred.  Under  circumstances  of  a commission,  the  artist’s  time  cannot  be  considered  as  charitable  donation  and  used  as  an income tax deduction. 2.7.5.  Contracting for the services of a professional appraiser may be necessary to determine the value of older artworks. 2.8.  Financial  Reporting.  AFAP  will  provide  the  fair  market  value  or  best  estimate  of  Air Force artworks  as of 30 September in  a Supporting Schedule  as explained in  DFAS  5010.32R, General Accounting and Finance Systems at Base Level. This report goes to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS-DE/ADR) by 15 October annually. 2.8.1.  AFAP reports all artworks in the Air Force Art Collection. 2.8.2.  Organizations report works of art worth more than $250 that are not in the Air Force Art Collection. 2.8.3.  AFAP follows the guidance in DFAS-DE 7010.1-R for capitalization and depreciation criteria. 2.9.  Reproduction  of  Artworks.  Many  of  the  art  pieces  in  the  Air  Force  Art  Collection  are subject  to  copyright  and  may  not  be  reproduced  without  the  copyright  owner's  permission. Individuals  wishing  to  reproduce  artwork  in  the  Collection  shall  submit  a  written  request  to AFAP. Each request will be handled on a case-by-case basis, and permission may or may not be granted  depending  upon  the  circumstances  of  the  request,  any  restrictions  (copyright  or AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 13 otherwise)  that  may  apply  to  the  artwork,  and  the  rights  the  Air  Force  may  have  in  the  work based on a prior agreement (e.g., royalty-free license). In addition, while AFAP may assist with coordinating a reproduction request with an artist or owner, AFAP does not guarantee permission to reproduce the artwork will be obtained. 2.9.1.  Reproduced  artwork  must  not  be  altered,  nor  shall  it  be  overprinted.  Users  will identify  artworks  by  title,  artist  name,  and  the  notation  “Courtesy,  U.S.  Air  Force  Art Collection.”(T-1). 2.9.2.  Requests to use or reproduce artwork in the Air Force Art Collection for commercial use may require additional considerations not specifically outlined above. 2.10.  De-accessioning Artwork.  Artwork may be disposed of because of irreparable damage or theft.  AFAP members may also evaluate artwork and determine that it does not align with the AFAP mission. Excess artworks acquired as an unconditional gift may be transferred to other Air Force,  DoD,  or  government  agencies,  or  disposed  through  the  servicing  Defense  Logistics Agency (DLA). Transfer or disposal of artworks acquired as conditional gifts will depend on the terms of the original instruments of offer and acceptance and must comply with the provisions of AFI 51-601 and DoD 4160.21-M. In all cases, local inventory records will reflect any transfer or disposal  actions.  The  AFAP  will  ensure  that  the  database  is  updated  to  reflect  the  items  de-accessioned. 2.11.  Transporting  and  Shipping  of  Artwork.  AFAP  will  coordinate  and  approve  all transportation of artwork. Artwork will not be transported by personal vehicle from one location to  another  nor  will  individuals  be  allowed  to  carry  artwork  on  government  conveyances  (e.g. MilAir) unless they are members of the AFAP staff or unless AFAP has approved this mode of transportation. To return artwork to the AFAP or to transfer it to another MAJCOM/DRU/FOA, the custodian will contact AFAP to coordinate shipping. 2.11.1.  If the artwork is being transported to another organization outside of the custodian’s chain  of  command,  he  will  notify  AFAP  prior  to  shipping  and  inform  AFAP  of  tracking information. The recipient organization will notify AFAP when they receive the artwork and let AFAP know its location to ensure a proper chain of custody. AFAP  will ensure that the database is updated to reflect the correct location of the artwork. 2.12.  Termination  or  expiration  of  artwork  loan  . AFAP may terminate or allow expiration of artwork loans. Such action may be executed to reassign artwork to another project, including but  not  limited  to  conservation  or  restoration;  study  or  display;  secure  artwork  from  non-compliance with loan agreement terms such as negligent or willful misuse.  AFAP may initiate immediate  repossession  and/or  recall  of  all  artworks  on  loan  to  an  organization  at  the organization’s  expense  or  possible  judicial  or  initiate  criminal  prosecution  as  applicable  and appropriate.

Do Not Remove.   AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 17 Attachment 3 GUIDANCE ON CONDUCTING AN ROS FOR LOST, DAMAGED, OR STOLEN ARTWORK A3.1.  A Report of Survey is normally done when art custodians discover art is lost, damaged or stolen. While the overall procedure is similar throughout, the results will be different depending on whether artwork is lost, damaged (deliberate or accidental), or stolen. A3.1.1.  The Director of Operations SAF/AAO approves ROS of artwork valued at $10,000 or less. A3.1.2.  Artwork greater than $10,000 the ROS will be approved by the Deputy SAF/AA.(T-1). A3.1.3.  Air  Force  organizations  should  not  file  for  a  ROS  until  SAF/AAO  authorizes  the organization. A3.1.4.  SAF/AA is the final appellate authority for ROS appeals. A3.2.  Normally  damage  and  loss  becomes  apparent  during  the  annual  inventories.  The procedure begins as follows: A3.2.1.  If the artwork is lost/missing A3.2.1.1.  The  art  custodian  will  assume,  unless  there  is  overwhelming  evidence  to  the contrary,  that  missing  artwork  has  been  misplaced  or  relocated.  As  soon  as  he  realizes that  the  artwork  is  missing,  he  will  conduct  a  complete  inventory  of  artwork  in  his custody. A3.2.1.2.  If he finds the item in a different place, he will update the database to reflect its current location. He will have an art custodian in that room or branch sign for the artwork and complete a DD577 if such a form is not yet on file. He will also advise the head of that  organization  about  the  proper  protocol  for  moving  art  within  the  organization  or command. A3.2.1.2.1.  If,  after  a  complete  inventory  of  the  area  for  which  he  has  custody,  he does not locate the artwork, he will ask all other offices/divisions on the base to see if they have the artwork. They are to send him an email either verifying or denying this. They  are  required  to  respond.  A  nonresponse  will  NOT  be  taken  as  a  “no.”  The offices will have 30 days to respond. A3.2.1.2.2.  If,  after  receiving  a  negative  response  that  the  artwork  is  on  base,  the custodian  will  contact  the  MAJCOM  custodian.  The  MAJCOM  custodian  will  send out  a  request  to  all  units  within  the  MAJCOM  asking  if  they  have  seen  or  have  the artwork. He will require a response. A nonresponse will not be taken as a “no.” The field units have 30 days to respond. A3.2.1.2.3.  If a field unit has the artwork, the MAJCOM custodian will notify the art custodian. At the discretion of the MAJCOM, the artwork may be either returned to the original owner (organization with the artwork “on the books”) or retained on base. If it is retained on base, the database will be updated to reflect the new location. If it is returned, it will be assigned to the MAJCOM until it is received at the lower level. 18 AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 A3.2.1.2.4.  If a field unit has the artwork, the MAJCOM custodian will notify the art custodian. At the discretion of the MAJCOM, the artwork may be either returned to the original owner (organization with the artwork “on the books”) or retained on base. If it is retained on base, the database will be updated to reflect the new location. If it is returned, it will be assigned to the MAJCOM until it is received at the lower level. A3.2.1.2.5.  If a field unit has the artwork, the MAJCOM custodian will notify the art custodian. At the discretion of the MAJCOM, the artwork may be either returned to the original owner (organization with the artwork “on the books”) or retained on base. If it is retained on base, the database will be updated to reflect the new location. If it is returned, it will be assigned to the MAJCOM until it is received at the lower level. A3.2.1.2.6.  If a field unit has the artwork, the MAJCOM custodian will notify the art custodian. At the discretion of the MAJCOM, the artwork may be either returned to the original owner (organization with the artwork “on the books”) or retained on base. If it is retained on base, the database will be updated to reflect the new location. If it is returned, it will be assigned to the MAJCOM until it is received at the lower level. A3.2.1.2.7.  If  the  item  is  not  located  at  the  base  or  MAJCOM  level,  the  base  will notify the AFAP and begin the Report of Survey Process. A3.2.1.3.  Report of Survey process for lost art A3.2.1.3.1.  The  organization  that  is  listed  as  having  possession  of  the  artwork  will initiate  the  ROS  and  that  commander  (or  equivalent)  or  appointing  authority  will appoint  an  investigating  officer  to  locate  the  artwork  according  to  AFMAN  23-220, Chapter 4. A3.2.1.3.2.  The  investigator  will  spend  60  days  researching  and  searching  for  the artwork. If he finds it, it will be returned to the custodian. If he does not, he will draft a Report of Survey. A3.2.1.3.2.1.  Each ROS will have a unique descriptor assigned to it, typically the year of the investigation and the number of ROS that went before it. For example, the fourth investigation of 2015 would be ROS 2015-004. A3.2.1.3.2.2.  Each  ROS  will  include  a  description  of  what  happened;  how  he investigated; and recommendations to prevent a recurrence of the action. A3.2.1.3.2.3.  The  ROS  will  be  submitted  to  AFAP.  Once  it  is  submitted  to AFAP,  the  AFAP  will  mark  the  case  closed,  remove  the  artwork  from  the custodian’s history, and put it in the database file: AAO/Pentagon/ Lost, Missing, Stolen/ N/A. On the comments line will be the ROS number. A3.2.1.4.  If  the  artwork  is  later  recovered,  the  AFAP  will  be  notified  and  the  database updated to reflect its current location. A3.2.2.  If the artwork is damaged or vandalized: A3.2.2.1.  Because it is the policy of the AFAP to display artwork to the public, the art is at a greater risk of damage than if it were safely locked behind closed doors. There will be normal wear and tear on artwork if it is displayed over a long enough period of time – AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 19 frames break, painting may begin to flake, artwork may be accidentally exposed to water or fire damage. A3.2.2.2.  If the damage is normal “wear and tear,” the accountable officer will notify the AFAP. If the artwork can be repaired locally (new frame, new glass) and does not affect the  integrity  of  the  artwork,  at  the  discretion  of  the  AFAP  the  artwork  may  be  repaired locally. No ROS is necessary. A3.2.2.3.  If the damage is more extensive than routine “wear and tear,” the accountable officer will notify the AFAP. It will be returned to the AFAP for repair and conservation. If  the  cost  to  repair  versus  the  value  of  the  artwork  does  not  justify  repairing  the  item, AFAP  will  remove  it  from  inventory,  de-accession  the  item,  and  have  it  destroyed through DLA in accordance with their rules and guidelines. No ROS is necessary. A3.2.2.4.  If  the  artwork  is  damaged  through  vandalism,  the  accountable  officer  is required to submit a Report of Survey. A3.2.2.4.1.  Upon  receipt  of  the  ROS,  the  AFAP  will  remove  the  item  from  the database. A3.2.2.4.2.  In  the  event  an  item  is  vandalized  in  a  civil  location  (museum, association, etc.), the custodian will contact the police. The police report, which will be sent to the AFAP, will constitute the ROS for that organization. The item will be returned to the AFAP and may be removed from inventory. A3.2.2.5.  The accountable officer will notify the wing commander (and the AFAP) about the damage. A3.2.2.5.1.  Willful  (or  gross)  negligence  is  the  intentional  performance  of  an unreasonable  act  in  disregard  of  a  known  risk,  making  it  highly  probable  that  harm will  be  caused.  Willful  negligence  usually  involves  a  conscious  indifference  to  the consequences.  In  instances  of  willful  negligence,  Accountable  Officers  will  request the base/wing commander appoint an officer to perform a Report of Survey. (T-1). A3.2.2.5.2.  The officer will investigate the nature of the negligence, determine who is  responsible  for  the  negligence  (if  possible),  and  take  corrective  action  to  prevent further  damage.  This  may  include  removing  the  item  from  the  location  where  the damage occurred and returning it to the AFAP. A3.2.2.5.3.  The investigating officer will have 30 days to produce the ROS. If more time is required, he may submit an interim report at the end of the 30 days. A3.2.2.5.4.  If the artwork can be restored and the individual(s) can be determined, he will be responsible for the cost of restoration. A3.2.2.5.5.  The  investigating  officer  will  provide  the  Report  of  Survey  to  the Accountable  Officers  and  to  the  AFAP.  The  report  will  include  the  nature  of  the damage, the individual, and recommendations to prevent a recurrence. A3.2.2.5.6.  Depending on how severely the artwork is damaged, it is either restored or taken off the books permanently. A3.2.2.5.7.  Sometimes  the  borderline  between  simple  negligence  and  willful negligence  is  not  readily  determined.  When  damage  occurs  through  any  kind  of 20 AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 negligence, the Accountable Officer will remind the organization in possession of the artwork is a privilege and basic standards of care of expected. These include keeping artwork away from copiers, microwaves, coffee areas (or other areas where food and beverages are prepared and consumed). A3.2.2.5.8.  Penalties  for  willful  negligence  will  be  more  severe  than  simple negligence. A3.2.2.5.9.  No  ROS  is  required  for  simple  negligence.  A  description  of  what occurred and why will be sufficient. A3.2.2.6.  The  wing/base  commander  will  appoint  an  individual  to  investigate  how  the damage occurred, whether there were sufficient  protections in place (or whether normal protections were disregarded) to have prevented the damage, the date, time and location of the damage, and who is responsible for the damage or vandalism. A3.2.2.7.  The investigator will have 30 days from notification to conduct the survey. If he  has  not  identified  the  individual,  he  will  generate  an  interim  report  describing  his progress to date. A3.2.2.8.  If the individual is identified, he will be liable for civil and criminal penalties, up  to  the  maximum  allowed  by  the  UCMJ  or  civil  law.  The  penalty  will  be  assessed based on the assigned value of the artwork. It is important to note that financial restitution does not restore the artwork. Once vandalized, that piece of AF history is forever gone. The investigating officer will submit copies of the ROS to the accountable officer and to the  AFAP.  The  final  report  will  include,  if  necessary,  proactive  recommendations  to prevent the situation from recurring. (T-1). A3.2.3.  Report of Survey for stolen artwork A3.2.3.1.  There  will  always  be  an  incident  report  (Report  of  Survey,  police  report) whenever artwork is stolen. A3.2.3.2.  If  artwork  was  in  a  civil  location  (museum,  association)  and  it  is  stolen,  the custodian will immediately call the police to investigate the theft. A3.2.3.2.1.  Civil law will apply in the event that the thief is apprehended. A3.2.3.2.2.  If the  artwork is  not  recovered, it will  be put  on the  FBI’s watchlist  for stolen artwork. A3.2.3.2.3.  Artwork must clearly be stolen (versus lost or misplaced) for it to be put on the FBI’s watchlist. A3.2.3.3.  If the item was at a military location when it was stolen, the action officer will contact both the base police and the wing commander as soon as they know about it. A3.2.3.3.1.  The wing commander will appoint an investigator to perform a Report of Survey. A3.2.3.3.2.  The  base  police  officers  will  have  primary  responsibility  for  the investigation, including  arresting the offender(s)  if the artwork is located. Offenders will be processed and tried in accordance with the relevant military or civil laws. AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 21 A3.2.3.3.3.  The  role  of  the  investigator  for  the  ROS  is  to  talk  with  the  individual reporting  the  theft  (approximate  date,  time,  anything  suspicious,  etc).  He  will  also determine if there were any reasonable steps that the Accountable Officer could have taken to prevent the theft. A3.2.3.3.4.  The ROS will be submitted within 30 days of the report of the theft to the Accountable Officer and AFAP. In addition, the police report will be included as an attachment to the ROS. A3.2.3.3.5.  Once AFAP receives the ROS, it will be removed from active inventory. If the artwork is recovered in good condition, it will be put back into active rotation. A3.2.3.3.6.  If  the  artwork  is  recovered  but  damaged,  it  will  be  returned  (following any trial where it may be needed as evidence) to AFAP for disposition. A3.2.4.  Investigating Officer for Reports of Survey A3.2.4.1.  The investigating officer for the Report of Survey should be at minimum either a  major  (or  O-3  equivalent),  a  master  sergeant  (E-7)  or  equivalent,  or  a  GS-5  (or equivalent). A3.2.4.2.  During the ROS period, the investigator’s sole responsibility will be collecting data,  attempting  to  locate  the  missing  (or  damaged)  item,  preparing  the  report,  and making recommendations to prevent a recurrence of the action. A3.2.4.3.  The investigator will develop the facts in the case which will logically lead to the findings and recommendations(s): A3.2.4.3.1.  The investigator must interview any persons with knowledge of the case if  they  are  in  the  immediate  area.  This  includes  the  person(s)  who  may  have  lost, damaged, or destroyed the property. A3.2.4.3.2.  Obtain  written  statements  from  persons  interviewed.  These  statements will be sworn in and attested to. A3.2.4.3.3.  Attach  witness  statements  to  the  ROS.  They  must  substantiate  the statements and the findings and recommendations of the investigator. A3.2.4.3.4.  Ensure that all witnesses are identified by first name, middle initial, last name,  rank  or  grade,  SSN,  organization  to  which  assigned,  and  if  applicable  the address of the witnesses. A3.2.4.3.5.  Include  a  statement  that  will  indicate  how  the  witness  is  (or  was) involved in the case or how the witness has knowledge of the situation.(T-1). A3.2.4.3.6.  Indicate  in  block  9  (Circumstances)  of  the  DD  Form  200  whether  any laws or directives or procedures were violated. A3.2.4.3.7.  Attempt  to  communicate  with  witnesses  not  in  the  immediate  area  and obtain  written  statements  which  the  witness  will  certify  as  being  true  and  correct  to the best of the knowledge and belief of the witness, or request that the witness prepare a statement and swear to it in front of a notary public or military official authorized to administer oaths. AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 A3.2.4.3.8.  Complete  blocks  9  (Circumstances  in  the  case  and  the  investigator's findings and recommendations) and 10 (Corrective Actions) on the DD Form 200. A3.2.4.3.9.  Ensure  that  the  findings  and  the  recommendations  are  supported  by  the testimony  of  persons  involved  and  that  the  testimony  leads  logically  to  the  findings and recommendation. A3.2.4.3.10.  Include DOD Form 200 when completing a ROS.  It may  be located at the http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/forms/eforms/dd0200.pdf following address:   22  AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 23 Attachment 4 COMPLETING A DD FORM 200 A4.1.  Date  initiated  (YYYYMMDD).  This  is  the  date  that  an  investigating  officer  was appointed to engage in the Report of Survey A4.2.  Inquiry investigation number. Because the reports of survey for artwork are significantly different from normal ROS’s, the ROS number does NOT have to be sequential for the base. It DOES  have  to  be  sequential  for  the  Report  of  Survey  for  lost,  missing,  damaged,  or  stolen artwork. The number must include the year, the sequential number of art investigations, and the base/wing in question. A4.3.  Date  Loss  Discovered  (YYYYMMDD):  The  date  of  loss  should  be  as  close  to  the  real date as possible. However there are instances where the loss was discovered many years ago and there was no action taken on it or an ROS was not completed. If unsure as to when the loss first occurred,  use  the  date  that  the  Accountable  Officer  discovered  the  artwork  was  missing,  lost, stolen, or damaged. A4.4.  National  Stock Number:  Artwork is  not  part of the National  Stock program.  The unique identifier will be the item’s accession number. A4.5.  Item Description: Name of the painting, the artist, and – whenever possible – a thumbnail of the painting. A4.6.  Quantity: One. A4.7.  Unit  Cost:  This  will  be  based  on  the  assessed  value  that  the  AFAP  has  assigned  it. Generally it will be valued approximately $2000; however contact the AFAP for the value it has assigned it. A4.8.  Total Cost: Item 6 times Item 7. A4.9.  Circumstances  under  which  the  property  was  (choose  one:  Lost/  Damaged/  Destroyed): Choose whether the property was lost, damaged or destroyed. Provide a narrative as to how the Accountable Officer came to find out that the item required a ROS. This includes who had it last, when it was last seen, why they went looking for it, how it was damaged/destroyed, etc. Multiple pages are fine. A4.10.  Actions  Taken  to  Correct  Circumstances  Reported  in  Block  9  and  Prevent  Future Occurrences: It may well be that the Accountable Officer has taken reasonable measures and that items are still accidentally damaged or destroyed. If there are no reasonable corrective measures, none need to be reported. A4.11.  The investigator will complete blocks 1-11. A4.12.  The  Accountable  Officer  will  complete  block  12,  checking  “Responsible  Officer (Property Record Items). A4.13.  Appointing Authority: The individual who appointed the investigator will sign blocks 13 and  14.  Generally  there  will  not  be  a  financial  liability  officer  appointed  or  a  legal  review required. A4.14.  Approving Authority: See block 13 24 AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 A4.15.  Financial Liability Officer: This will not be required. The cost to repair damaged artwork or the assessed value of the artwork (if it is destroyed) will only be assessed in cases of willful negligence or theft. A4.16.  Individual  Charged:  In  the  event  that  an  individual  is  charged  for  theft  or  malicious damage to the artwork, he will complete the form. A4.17.  Accountable  Officer:  The  ultimate  accountable  officer  will  be  the  AFAP  which  will adjust the property records. However the local accountable officer will sign the document. The document  number  changed  is  the  accession  number;  his  name,  address,  telephone  number, signature, and date signed will be included. AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 25 Figure A4.1.

The Air Force Art Program’s philosophical belief is that artwork should be on display and not  tucked  away  in  a  storage  facility.  Therefore,  art  is  located  at  more  than  100  locations worldwide. As a result, the program relies heavily on its custodians and accountable officers to protect, safeguard, display, and promote Air Force art. A5.2.  Naturally this can affect the degree of oversight that the program can control. AFAP relies on the professionalism of the Air Force historians who serve as the chief accountable officers of each location, in accordance with AFI 84-101, Historical Products, Services, and Requirements, Section 1.4.2.11 (Manage the command museum program and Air Force art holdings). A5.3.  Accountable Officer training enhances the ability to manage holdings and some methods are: A5.3.1.  Attending the annual meeting of the Air Force Historians A5.3.1.1.  Brief on the art program, inventory methods and requirements, and issues and opportunities available. A5.3.1.2.  Meet  the Accountable Officers and Custodians and solicit feedback on issues at the base and MAJCOM level. A5.3.1.3.  Encourage  interchanges  among  the  historians  to  seek  best  practices.  Best practices at one location may not be the case at another location because of staffing, size, or culture. However there should be a free exchange of ideas so AFAP can identify issues and develop solutions to remedy the problems in conjunction with Accountable Officers /custodians A5.3.1.4.  Provide  handouts,  briefing  charts,  and  other  information  for  custodians/ Accountable Officers A5.3.2.  Develop  CBE  (computer  based  education)  modules  on  AF  art  custodianship; performing  inventories;  proper  maintenance  of  artwork;  developing  a  report  of  survey;  and using the database. With the implementation  of the new RFID system,  accountable officers will be trained in how to use the hardware and software. A5.3.3.  Arrange  a  teleconference  with  AFAP  staff  in  the  event  that  other  training  methods are unavailable. their A5.3.3.1.  Accountable  officers  will, responsibilities. It will be left to the Accountable Officers’ discretion how often and the best method of providing this training. their  custodians in turn, train in A5.3.3.2.  The  teleconference  will  be  conducted  in  three  discrete  time  slots  to  take  into account the worldwide dispersion of AF art (e.g. 0800-1600 EST; 1600-2400 EST; 0001-0800 EST). This will help ensure the broadest possible availability of training. A5.3.3.3.  If it turns out  that there are few people for the training exercise in one of the three groups, it will be subsumed into one of the other groups. A5.3.4.  Obtain  onsite  training  and  feedback  when  AFAP  goes  TDY  to  the  Accountable Officer’s organization. AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 28  AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 29 Attachment 6 THE RFID SYSTEM A6.1.  The RFID system is an inventory method using radiofrequency identification tags which are connected to the AF Art Database. The goal of the RFID is to speed up inventory procedures, ensure that items which go missing are more easily found, and to ensure that the AF art database is  as  close  to  being  accurate  as  possible.  The  RFID  will  notify  the  system  when  artwork  is moved. A6.2.  It  is  critical  that  the  information  in  the  database  align  with  the  information  in  the  RFID reader. The initial scanning should make the database as correct as possible. A6.3.  When the data from the database does not match the data on the back of the artwork (or no data is available), the artwork will be set aside until elements can be aligned. A6.4.  At  the  time  an  RFID  sticker  is  attached,  artwork  will  be  examined  to  replace  all missing/incorrect  identification  labels  and  property  stickers.  If  artwork  is  missing  an identification tag at the time the RFID label is attached, it will be annotated and  a label will be provided to the Accountable Officer within 60 days of the inventory. If the artwork is missing a property sticker, it will be provided within 30 days of the inventory. During the inventory, if any additional data is missing, such as an image of the artwork, the size, the medium, or description, best efforts will be made by the AFAP (or the Accountable Officers) to provide the information. The database will be updated with the best available information at the time the RFID sticker is attached. A6.5.  No  items  will  be  shipped  out  after  the  RFID  is  in  place,  unless  the  artwork  has  been scanned and assigned an RFID number. When an organization which is not the AFAP receives the  artwork,  they  will  scan  it  into  the  system  so  that  locations  will  be  immediately  updated. When they transfer the artwork, they will scan it before shipping it elsewhere. It will be scanned upon receipt. A6.6.  It is expected that it will be several years before all artwork in the program is successfully scanned into the system and the system updated. The system will be beta tested using artwork in the Pentagon. If it is successful, this will serve as the annual inventory for that year. In addition to  the unique RFID identifier, the AFAP  will ensure that the title and accession  number match the  picture  in  the  database  (if  there  is  no  picture,  they  will  remove  the  painting  for  scanning). They  will  also  ensure  that  the  “Do  Not  Remove”  stickers  are  on  the  artwork,  the  location  is correct, and that the accession number is visible on back of the painting. If not, they will correct the situation. The database will automatically notify the AFAP when an annual inventory needs to be completed. A6.7.  Annual inventories should be significantly less time consuming, since the AFAP (or their accountable officers) can just “wand” the artwork to  see if it has an RFID sticker and is  in  the location the database says it is supposed to be. This will eliminate significant amounts of labor and reduce the opportunities for errors. A6.8.  Following beta testing at the Pentagon, the AFAP will go to the MAJCOMs to implement the program offsite. They will train the MAJCOM Accountable Officers in how to use the RFID system. In turn, the MAJCOM Accountable Officers will train their subordinate units. 30 AFI84-104  20 JULY 2017 A6.9.  At the MAJCOM, the AFAP and MAJCOM Accountable Officers will engage in the same verification methods mentioned above – checking title, accession number, and photos against the artwork.  MAJCOM  Accountable  Officers  will  get  their  own  RFID  gun  and  RFID  reader  to upload  information  into  the  database  for  future  inventories.  When  initial  RFID  inventory  is completed and all anomalies have been rectified, they will have completed the inventory. They will receive notice when it is time to perform it again. A6.10.  If  artwork  is  listed  as  being  in  the  database  and  is  not  scanned  or  located,  a  Report  of Survey will be performed and the database updated to reflect that it is lost/stolen/or destroyed.
