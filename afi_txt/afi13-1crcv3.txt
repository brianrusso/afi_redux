General  Purpose.  This  instruction  establishes  responsibilities,  policies  and  procedures applicable  to  all  Air  Control  Squadrons  (ACS), Test  Squadrons  (TS),  and  Field  Training  Units (FTU)  that  employ  or  train  utilizing  TYQ-23  Modular  Control  Equipment  (MCE).  The remaining  unit  instructions  contain  detailed  procedures  and  criteria  for  the  evaluation  of individuals assigned operations duties by specific systems. 1.1.1.  Scope. This instruction outlines the procedures applicable to the conduct of operations of  the  Control  and  Reporting  Center  (CRC),  normally  equipped  with  the  MCE  weapons systems.  With  the  complementary  references,  this  volume  prescribes  standard  operating procedures  for  all  CRC  operations  crews  and  all  management  levels  concerned  with  the operation of CRC equipment. 1.1.1.1.  In the absence of additional guidance, CRC mission crews operating equipment other than MCE equipment will use this volume as baseline for conduct of operations, at the discretion of the deployed Commander (CC), Major Command (MAJCOM), or other authorities. 1.1.1.2.  This  instruction  does  not  provide  tactics,  techniques,  or  procedures  (TTP)  for employing  the  CRC  in  a  combat  environment.  Guidance  on  tactical  employment  of  the CRC can be found in AFTTP 3-1, Theater Air Control Squadron (TACS) and AFTTP 3-3, Theater Air Ground System (TAGS) and related volumes. 1.2.  Mission  Crew  Responsibility.  This  volume,  in  conjunction  with  other  governing directives, prescribes procedures for employing the CRC under most circumstances.   It is not a substitute for sound judgment.  Procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished IAW theater  guidance.    Deviations  will  be  reported  through  the  Operational  Chain-of-Command Tactical Control (TACON) authority (T-3). 1.3.  Waivers. 1.3.1.  Waiver  authority  for  requirements  of  this  volume  will  be  IAW  AFI-33-360, Publications  and  Forms  Management.    Waiver  requests  must  come  from  commanders  (or civilian directors) of the affected unit seeking relief from compliance through the command chain  up  to  the  appropriate  tier  approval  authority  (i.e.,  Tier  0,  1,  2,  3)  (or  publications approval authority if non-tiered).  See AFI 33-360 for definition of Tier Ratings. 1.3.2.  Waiver requests may be sent via email or memorandum, and include the following: 1.3.2.1.  Reference and text of the specific requirement for which the commander/director is requesting a waiver. 1.3.2.2.  Rationale for the waiver: Explain which of the following three reasons IAW AFI 33-360, apply and describe why: 1.3.2.2.1.  The cost of compliance creates unacceptable risk to a higher priority task; 1.3.2.2.2.  The expected cost of compliance outweighs the benefit; AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010   7  1.3.2.2.3.  Personnel  cannot  comply  with  the  requirement  due  to  a  lack  of  resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower). 1.3.2.3.  Time period or circumstance for which the waiver is required. 1.3.2.4.  Risk  mitigation measures the  requesting  commander will implement  during the waiver period. 1.3.2.5.  Impact if waiver is disapproved. 1.3.2.6.

The Squadron/Unit Director of Operations (DO) directs the execution  of  the  unit’s  operations  schedule.    The  DO  ensures  that  all  operations  personnel provide  crews  with  the  requisite  support  to  plan  and  execute  their  mission.    The  DO  ensures crews/mission  planners  have  no  barriers  to  mission  planning  and  ensure  that  every  mission  is thoroughly planned, briefed, executed, and debriefed. 2.1.1.  Mission  Planning  Options.    The  DO  normally  chooses  from  three  mission  planning profiles  when  executing  the  daily  in-garrison  operating  schedule  or  the  Air  Tasking  Order (ATO)  cycle:  prior-day  mission  planning,  same-day  mission  plan/execute,  and  Mission Planning Cell (MPC) operations. 2.1.1.1.  Prior-day  mission  planning.  Mission  planning  is  held  the  duty  day  prior  to execution. This option is preferred for Mission Training Exercises (MTE). 2.1.1.2.  Same-day mission planning. Mission planning is held the same duty day as the operation event. This option is preferred for 24-hour operations in the absence of a MPC. 2.1.2.  Mission  Planning  Cell  (MPC)  operations.  Mission  planning  is  conducted  by  a dedicated MPC in accordance  with Section 2.9  and Attachment  6 of this instruction. This option is preferred for 24-hour operations when manning is available. 2.1.2.1.  The  intent  of  mission  planning  is  to  ensure  the  crew  is  properly  prepared  to execute the tasked mission, to have on hand all applicable mission materials, and debrief and capture applicable lessons learned. The use of slides, forms, or other administrative products  is  a  means  to  the  end  of  preparing  the  crew,  but  is  not  necessary  in  order  to conduct mission planning. 2.2.  Responsibilities.  As  the  Officer  in  Charge  (OIC),  the  responsibility  for  mission  planning rests  with  the  Mission  Crew  Commander  (MCC).    Operations  crews  may  perform  their  own mission planning or units may utilize MPCs in order to meet mission planning requirements.  In any  case,  qualified to  perform  mission  planning  and/or briefings/debriefings.  Units develop specific procedures to ensure all mission crew members are thoroughly prepared for each duty shift or event. individuals  are  designated 2.3.  Forms  and  Logs.  The  DO  ensures  AF  Form  4145,  Daily  Activity  Log,  AF  Form  4146, Mission Briefing Guide, DD Form 1972, Joint Tactical Air Strike Request, DD Form 1975, Joint Tactical Air Reconnaissance/Surveillance Request, and Forward Air Control – Close Air Support (FAC  CAS)  9-Line  Briefing  Form  are  readily  available  to  meet  operational  requirements  in support of CRC daily operations. Note:  FTUs will use only AF Forms 4145 and 4146 (T-2). 2.3.1.  AF  Form  4145,  Daily Activity Log. The MCC or DO designee is  responsible for the Daily  Activity  Log.  The  form  is  required  to  be  completed  and  signed  at  the  completion  of each  operations  crew  shift  and  forwarded  to  the  DO  for  approval  and  signature.  The  daily activity log provides a complete summary of all crew operations for a particular shift and is an important tool for data correlation and analysis. AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010   9  2.3.2.  AF  Form  4146,  Mission  Briefing  Guide.  Use  the  Mission  Briefing  Guide  to  brief missions, record mission results, and serve as a record of unit control activities. Air Weapons Officers/Weapons  Directors  (WDs)  use  the  form  for  all  control  activities  conducted  and forwarded to the MCC or crew leader for review and attach to AF Form 4145, Daily Activity Log. 2.3.3.  Operations  Logbook.    The  operations  logbook  is  the  official  record  of  events  that occurred  during  UCC  activation  for  major  theater  operations  and  real  world  contingency operations  or  in-garrison  live  training  missions  (if  manning  allows,  DMO  and  simulated missions can also be logged).  The purpose is to maintain an accurate and detailed record of all significant events pertaining to operations occurring during each crew shift or event.  Of primary  importance  are  specific  events  that  may  result  in  subsequent  investigations.  Secondarily, information contained in the logbook may result in significant lessons learned.  The BSC will ensure that the operations logbook is properly maintained IAW Attachment 5 (T-2). 2.3.3.1.  The  operations  logbook,  while  not  a  mission  planning  document,  will  be reviewed  prior  to  assumption  of  mission  operations  responsibility  for  pertinent information  regarding  equipment  status,  lessons  learned,  and  other  pertinent  mission information from previous days in connection with current mission operations (T-3). 2.4.  Briefings/Debriefings.  As  the  OIC,  the  MCC  briefs/debriefs  all  crewmembers  to  ensure safe/effective  mission  accomplishment.    Local  briefing  guides  (developed  IAW  Attachment  3 and Attachment 4 of this instruction) will be used to provide a reference list of items that apply to a particular mission and will be used as the basis for briefings/debriefings (T-3).  Brief items in  any  logical  sequence;  and  those  items  formally  documented  in  publications,  such  as  local operations  standards,  may  be  briefed  as  “standard.”   All  crew  members  attend briefings/debriefings  unless  specifically  excused  by  the  MCC  unless  local  procedures  dictate otherwise. 2.4.1.  In-Garrison  (Training)  Operations.    While  the  CRC  is  in-garrison,  the  unit  is  less likely to be conducting 24-hour operations.  Mission planning is oriented toward the event or scenario.  Note that the event or scenario can be a live-fly event (fighter support), a tactical data link (TDL) exercise, a MTE, or any other scheduled training event. 2.4.2.  Contingency  (24-hour)  Operations.    While  the  CRC  is  conducting  contingency  or exercise  operations  on  a  24-hour  basis,  mission  planning  is  oriented  towards  the  duty  shift coming on at the time of the Step Briefing.  During 24-hour operations, the MCC coming on shift  or  the  MPC  Chief  coordinates  with  the  current  on-position  MCC  to  gather  situational awareness on the current operation and conducts mission planning to cover the period of the duty shift.  In most 24-hour operations, only a crew step brief is conducted prior to positional change-over. 2.4.3.  Debriefings.    Regardless  of  using  in-garrison  or  contingency  operations  mission planning  guidelines,  the  MCC  conducts  a  crew  debrief  to  capture  lessons  learned  and improve crew and system effectiveness.  Once an MPC chief has been appointed, the MPC chief is responsible for tracking lessons learned and briefing them to follow-on crews as soon as possible after the crew event.   10  AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010 2.5.  Mission  Briefing  Requirements.  The  squadron  CC,  as  applicable,  may  waive requirements contained in this paragraph if deemed necessary to accomplish a specific mission. 2.5.1.  In-Garrison Operation Briefings.  During in-garrison operations the planning/briefing sequence is 1) Pre-mission planning, 2) Section specialized briefings, and 3) Step brief.  The pre-mission briefing normally takes place after the crew reports on the day of the scheduled missions.    Specialized  briefings  are  conducted  as  required  by  each  section  to  cover  unique requirement within that section (e.g., surveillance section).  The step brief is conducted when and where the situation and timing allows for the sole purpose of capturing and disseminating any last minute or developing information critical to the mission crew.  It can be conducted one-on-one, by section, or to the entire crew. 2.5.2.  Contingency  Operation  Briefings. the planning/briefing sequence is generally the same as in-garrison operations, but can be limited to  a  step  or  on-position  briefing.    The  MCC  determines  the  briefing  requirements  and  is supported by the MPC. contingency  operations,   During 2.5.3.  Crew  Planning.    MCCs  use  Attachment  3  and  Attachment  4  and  locally  generated crew aids as guides to plan and brief the applicable items to the crew. Note:    Units  develop  and  document  guidance  for  items  that  are  commonly  briefed  as “standard.”    The  purpose  of  unit  or  local  standards  is  to  reduce  the  briefing  time  of administrative  tasks  to  allow  for  concentration  on  the  mission.    In  no  case  do  these procedures  relieve  the  operations  crew  of  the  responsibility  to  comply  with  USAF directives.    Operations  crews  use  these  procedures  unless  conditions,  objectives  or execution dictate the MCC/MPC Chief to brief as “non-standard.” 2.6.  Mission Planning Task Overview.  The following items are accomplished during mission planning by the MPC or applicable duty functions if the MPC is not operational. 2.6.1.  MCCs  ensure  mission  activities  are  planned  according  to  applicable  checklists  and guides. 2.6.2.  Objectives.    MCCs  develop  crew  objectives  for  the  event  or  duty  shift.    Air Surveillance  Officers  (ASO)  and  Senior  Directors  (SD)  develop  objectives  that  support  the crew objectives within their sections. 2.6.3.  MCC,  SD,  ASO,  Interface  Control  Technician  (ICT)  and  Battle  Staff  Coordinator (BSC)  and  CC  develop  a  communication  plan  to  ensure  accomplishment  of  mission requirements. 2.6.4.  The  DST  coordinates  all  computer  software  requirements.    Minimum  software requirements will be IAW local operating procedures (T-3).  Database inputs from individual sections should be provided to the DST well prior to the step brief. 2.6.5.  The  ASO,  Air  Surveillance  Technician  (AST),  or  their  designated  appointee  obtains equipment  status  from  the  appropriate  Maintenance  Operations  Center  (MOC)/Job  Control (JC).  During contingency operations the BSC is the point of contact with the MOC/JC and will record all statuses in the logbook (T-3). 2.6.6.  The  MCC  assesses  impact  of  equipment  limitations  and  adjust  tasking  as  necessary.  The MCC conducts a final review of mission crew planning. AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010   11  2.6.7.  Details on mission planning flow can be found in Appendix 3 and Appendix 4 of this instruction. 2.6.8.  For  local  live  flying  training  operations,  the  Air  Weapons  Officer  (AWO)/Weapons Director (WD) will coordinate to receive a briefing from the flight leads of all missions to be controlled (T-3). 2.7.  Local  Checklists/Crew  Aids.  Locally  produced  checklists  and  crew  aids  include  as  a minimum: 2.7.1.  Mission planning checklists (as required). 2.7.2.  Briefing guides (as required). 2.8.  Theater Procedures/Crew Aids.  Units specifically tasked to support an area of operations (AO) will develop theater procedure crew aids (classified/unclassified) and make them available to the crew upon deployment to the theater (T-3).  As a minimum, these aids will include (T-3): 2.8.1.  Communications plans. 2.8.2.  Crew positional actions/procedures. 2.8.3.  ID criteria and procedures (ID Matrix) 2.8.4.  Rules of Engagement (ROE). 2.8.5.  Link Architecture 2.8.6.  Equipment  set-up  and  management  (if  using  equipment  different  than  unit  has ingarrison). 2.8.7.  Callsign list of applicable units, aircraft, etc. 2.8.8.  Other information deemed necessary by the host unit. 2.9.  Mission  Planning Cell  (MPC).  Successful mission accomplishment is a direct result of a clear  and  concise  understanding  of  the  CRC  role  in  supporting  and  achieving  the  training  or campaign  objectives  that  can  be  achieved  through  mission  planning.    Upon  anticipation  or receipt of a real-world  or exercise alert,  warning, or execute order, the unit CC should activate the MPC.  The CRC MPC is the single point of contact for planning, tactical level coordination, and debriefing.  The MPC provides the staff and the mission crew with the most current mission execution  information  derived  from  all  available  sources.    The  ANG  CRC  MPC  function  is accomplished  by  the  duty  crew.    The  MPC  should  be  implemented  for  MTEs  to  develop, exercise and validate unit planning TTPs (T-3). 2.9.1.  When  manning  is  available  and  daily  shift  rotations  prevent  the  duty  crew  from conducting their own mission planning, the unit DO appoints the MPC Chief and ensures the MPC is manned.  MPC manning can be tailored in size, composition, functions, or grade to meet mission requirements.  Specific MPC duties and responsibilities are outlined in AFTTP 3-1CRC and Attachment 6 to this document. 2.9.2.  MPC Manning.  The MPC should contain personnel tailored to the particular mission being  conducted. During operations using a full  complement of duty  crew, an MPC should include (Table 2.1):   12  AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010 Figure 2.1.  MPC Manning.

This information is in addition to AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures; AFTTP 3-1.26,  Tactical  Employment  of  the  Theater  Air  Control  System  (TACS);  AFI  13-1  CRC  Vol.  1 Control and Reporting Center—Training;  AFI 13-1 CRC Vol.2, Control and Reporting Center Evaluation Criteria, and the current syllabus for the respective crew positions.  Not all positions have additional information. 3.1.1.  FTUs  will  adhere  to  paragraphs  3.2,  3.9,  and  3.10  and  subparagraphs  3.6.1  and 3.14.2.5 (T-3). 3.2.  Operations Management. 3.2.1.  The ACS/FTU/TS unit Commander (CC) and Director of Operations (DO) will be an Active  Component  Air  Force/Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  field  grade  officer  rank  and  will possess a 13B3D Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) (T-2). The CRC CC/DO is designated to perform  duties  of  the  Battle  Staff  (BS).    Each  unit  also  has  an  Operations  Superintendent manned  by  a  Chief  Master  Sergeant  possessing  a  1C500  AFSC.    The  Operations Superintendent  minimum  grade  requirement  for  the  TS/FTU  will  be  a  Senior  Master Sergeant possessing a 1C591 AFSC (T-3). 3.2.2.  The  DO  is  responsible  for  ensuring  operations  personnel  are  trained,  equipped,  and available to execute the tasks associated with the unit’s mission.  The DO creates, manages, and executes a daily schedule assigning duties to assigned personnel. 3.2.3.  During  daily,  in-garrison  training  operations,  the  DO  performs  the  duties  of  the  BS, and  establishes  procedures  for  managing  daily  operations  normally  handled  by  the  Unit Command Center (UCC). 3.3.  CRC Mission.  The operational mission of a CRC is to provide the Joint/Combined Forces Air Component Commander (J/CFACC) with the means to direct and execute air operations. The CRC provides the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) the primary interface for centralized command  of  BMC2  agencies  from  all  the  services  contributing  to  the  air  campaign  plan.  The CRC may be responsible for: 3.3.1.  Battle  Management  Command  and  Control  (BMC2).  The  CRC  BMC2  mission  is supported by the Modular Control System (MCS). The MCS is the equipment that provides the interoperability systems/components that enable CRC operators to make tactical decisions in the battlespace. communications connectivity, and the visual displays, 3.3.1.1.  Battle Management (BM). The Command and Control (C2) of air operations in a decentralized execution mode, by managing, disseminating, and assigning mission tasks defined  in  appropriate  tasking  orders.  This  also  includes  using  ground  and  airborne sensors to provide surveillance coverage in an assigned area. 3.3.2.  Surveillance.  Surveillance  functions  include  detection,  identification,  classification, and  tracking  of  airborne  objects.  CRC  sensors  (organic  and  netted),  detect  and  provide cueing  to  engage  hostile  manned  and  unmanned  aircraft  as  well  as  some  cruise  missiles.   14  AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010 Additional surveillance functions include electronic protection (EP) and the recognition and reporting of electronic attack (EA). 3.3.2.1.  Combat Identification (CID).  The CRC has the capability to disseminate timely, accurate,  and  relevant  identification  information  to  allow  engagement  of  hostile  targets and  avoid  fratricide.    In  addition  to  organic  system  capabilities  that  support  lack-of-friendly  and  presence-of-friendly  characterization i.e.,  Identification,  Friend,  or Foe/Selective  Identification  Feature  (IFF/SIF),  other  capabilities  and  information  from other  CID  capable  systems/assets  are  used  to  provide  the  CRC  a  positive  identification (PID) capability. 3.3.3.  Weapons  Control.  The  CRC  supports  and/or  coordinates  offensive  and  defensive counter  air  (OCA/DCA),  air  interdiction  (AI),  air  refueling  (AR),  close  air  support  (CAS), combat  search  and  rescue  (CSAR),  search  and  rescue,  high  value  airborne  asset  protection (HVAA), suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses (S/DEAD), electronic warfare (EW), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), special operations, and the direction of air defense artillery (ADA) systems in theater air defense (TAD). 3.3.4.  Combat  Airspace  Management.  The  CRC  provides  airspace  management  in  the implementation  of  the  Airspace  Control  Order  (ACO).  These  tasks  include  pre/post-strike force  marshalling  and  recovery  (referred  to  functionally  as  Check-In/Out),  en-route  tactical flight  following  in  expeditionary  environments,  control  in  support  of  ground  forces  (e.g., Troops in  Contact  (TIC)  support)  and  Continental  United  States  (CONUS)  air defense/homeland security support. 3.3.5.  Tactical  Data  Link  (TDL)  Management.  The  CRC  consolidates  organic  and nonorganic  sensors  into  the  common  tactical  picture  (CTP)  for  distribution  over  TDLs. Under the direction of the AOC’s Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO), the CRC manages the theater TDL architecture within its assigned operational area. The CRC supports Link 11, Link  11B,  Link  16,  Situational  Awareness  Data  Link  (SADL),  and  North  Atlantic  Treaty Organization (NATO)  Link 1. The CRC can act  as data forwarder and transmit  the CTP  to theater C2 nodes to include lateral, joint, and combined agencies in addition to the AOC. 3.4.  Tailored Equipment Configuration.  The CRC equipment is designed to be deployed in a configuration that meets the mission tasking. This results in a flexible system package capable of meeting a broad spectrum of operational mission profiles. The CRC uses scalable unit type codes (UTCs) to support combatant commander mission requirements. UTCs are capability focused to accomplish the assigned mission and consist of manpower and/or equipment. CRC UTCs can be tailored  based  on  the  theater  operational  mission  and  provide  an  efficient  means  to  deliver  the right  amount  of  capability  to  the  warfighter.  The  current  CRC  executes  BMC2  capabilities through  employment  of  deployed  UTCs.  It  executes  Battlespace  Awareness  (BA)  capabilities through  employment  of  Deployable  Radar  (DR)  UTCs.  Associated  communications,  vehicles, and  support  equipment  are  resident  with  the  UTCs.  Detailed  descriptions  of  the  UTCs  are contained in the CRC Mission Capability (MISCAP) statements. 3.4.1.  The  CRC  is  subordinate  to  the  AOC  and  provides  an  organic  communications capability  in  support  of  its  functions.    The  CRC  deploys  with  up  to  four  MCS  Operations Modules  (OMs),  two  AN/TPS-75  Radars,  Tri-Service  Tactical  Communications  System (TRI-TAC) communications equipment, Theater Deployable Communications (TDC), JTIDS AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010   15  Module (JM) and supporting equipment.  CRCs can extend radar coverage through the use of multiple sensors and remoting techniques, while the JMs support data link transmission. 3.4.2.  An additional augmented capability for the CRC is the use of non-organic radar access (NORA) which allows the CRC to access non-AN/TPS-75 Radars such as civilian air traffic control  radars  or  other  host  nation  tactical  radars  to  further  expand  radar  coverage  areas.  However, mission planning must be conducted since not all civil and other tactical RADARS may  work  using  the  NORA  (T-3).    Additional  equipment  such  as  AN/TRC-215,  Remote Radio  Secure  Voice  System  (RRSVS)  is  required  to  fully  and  successfully  integrate  non-organic radars and communications (for control of aircraft) for those sensors located Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) from the CRC. 3.5.  Mission  Crew  Manning.  A  CRC  mission  crew  is  defined  below  (Table  3.1  and  Table 3.2).  Positional  descriptions  highlight  the  specific  positional/crew  duties  and  responsibilities. Unit commanders may tailor crews to meet mission requirements. The Air Defense Artillery Fire Control  Officer  (ADAFCO)  is  assigned  to  CRC  once  the  Area  Air  Defense  Commander  or designated  representative  validates  the  positions.  Currently,  three  crews  are  required  for  a  full CRC (all core UTCs utilized). This is expected to increase to four crews in FY 2010. The three mission  crews  and  battle  staff  are  comprised  of,  but  not  limited  to,  the  following  optimum manning by grade per position: Table 3.1.

An  MCC  or  DO  determines  the crew  minimums  for  Mission  Training  Exercises  (MTE),  and  contingency  operations  as  the mission demands, specified in local operating standards. 3.5.4.  Where less than a full crew is employed and no MCC is available, the senior ranking individual  is  designated  the  Senior  Ranking  Officer  (SRO)  and  assumes  the  duties  of  the MCC as far as mission planning and execution are concerned. 3.5.4.1.  The  SRO  will  sign  the  AF  Form  4145  in  place  of  the  MCC  at  the  end  of  the appropriate duty shift (T-3). 3.5.4.2.  The SRO will not sign the AF Form 4145 as the DO unless normally authorized to do so as the designated DO (T-3). 3.6.  Crew Rest.  Parent/Deployed Operations Group Commander may waive all or any part of a crew  rest  period  (T-3).    Crew  members  will  enter  crew  rest  a  minimum  of  eight  hours  before show time (T-3).  Crew rest normally begins 1.5 hours after debrief.  If any crewmember must perform duties past the 1.5 hour period, crew rest does not begin until post-positional duties are completed (T-3). 3.6.1.  Minimum crew rest period is eight hours.  This provides the crew a minimum of eight hours of uninterrupted rest.  If crew rest is interrupted so that an individual cannot  get  eight hours of uninterrupted rest, the individual must be afforded eight more hours of uninterrupted rest  (T-3).    Any  interruption  must  be  made  only  under  the  most  exceptional  circumstances (T-3).   18  AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010 3.7.  Mission  Crew  Duty  Sections.  The  operational  duties  of  the  Mission  Crew  are  divided among three broad sections. 3.7.1.  Battle  Staff.  Battle  management  is  accomplished  by  the  Battle  Staff  (BS),  which consists  of  the  following  positions:    CC,  MCC,  and  BSC.  The  BS  maintains  maximum flexibility,  responsiveness,  and  timeliness  in  the  application  of  ACS  resources.  The  BS reviews  headquarters  guidance  and  directives,  monitors  status,  develops  courses  of  action and  implements  the  guidance  as  directed  by  the  AOC.  Chapter  4  details  the  duties  and responsibilities of the Battle Staff positions. 3.7.2.  Weapons.  The  weapons  section  conducts  the  weapons  control  mission  and  combat airspace control functions under the supervision of the MCC. The weapons positions are the SD, WD, AWO, and Air Defense Artillery Fire Control Officer (ADAFCO) (when assigned). Chapter 5 details the duties and responsibilities of the weapons positions. 3.7.2.1.  Army  Air  Defense  Artillery  (ADA)  asset  employment  will  be  coordinated  and directed through the ADAFCO (T-3). 3.7.2.2.  Three  ADAFCOs  will  be  required  once  the  CRC  has  been  tasked  with  Region Air Defense Commander (RADC)/Sector Air Defense Commander (SADC) duties IAW theater directives (T-3).  The ADAFCO(s) are assigned to the CRC and execute as part of the  CRC  mission  crew.    The  ADAFCO(s)  are  assigned  a  scope  and  necessary communications  in  order  to  execute  the  ADA  mission.  The  ADAFCO  coordinates  with the SD. 3.7.3.  Surveillance. The surveillance section conducts the surveillance and data management operations  and  some  airspace  control  and  battle  management  functions  while  under  the supervision of the MCC. The surveillance section is comprised of the ASO, AST, ICT, DST, EPT, and ST. Chapter 6 details the duties and responsibilities of the surveillance positions. 3.8.  Common  Mission  Crew  Responsibilities.  Regardless  of  duty  position  section,  the Mission  Crew  members  share  some  common  duty  responsibilities  and  tasks  in  addition  to  the position-specific  responsibilities  outlined  in  the  appropriate  chapters  of  this  instruction.  These include: 3.8.1.  Know the Commanders’ intent and J/CFACC mission statement. 3.8.2.  Attend crew briefing/debriefing and participate as required. 3.8.3.  Configure and operate the Operator Console Unit Workstation (OCUWS) and Voice Communications  Access  Sub-unit  (VCAS)  IAW  the  N-series  checklists  to  meet  mission requirements.  If  certified  to  use  a  system  other  than  V5  (e.g.,  BC3),  then  configure  and operate the console of that system IAW with applicable checklists and technical orders (TO). 3.8.4.  Read and interpret mission information on the OCUWS or other relevant scope/work stations. 3.8.5.  Read  and  initial  all  items  in  the  Operations  Information  File  (OIF)  read  file  prior  to assuming the duty position for the assigned tour of duty. 3.8.6.  Use  and  control  classified  materials  IAW  established  security  procedures;  employ information  assurance  (e.g.,  OPSEC)  procedures  as  required  by  regulations.  Authenticate voice transmissions as needed. AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010   19  3.8.7.  Locate  and  report  safety  hazards  in  and  around  the  OM,  AN/TPS-75  van  and  other workspace  areas.  Use  safety  equipment  as  necessary  and  implement  unit-level  emergency procedures IAW checklists. 3.8.8.  Prepare  and  conduct  a  positional  changeover  briefing  with  the  oncoming  mission crewmember  prior  to  departing  position  IAW  the  positional  changeover  briefing  guide  and unit checklists, if applicable. 3.8.9.  Obtain  eight  hours  of  crew  rest  between  shifts.  If  combat/contingency  operations prohibit proper crew rest, the Squadron CC/DO develops a plan to ensure crew members are capable of safely operating in their crew positions. 3.8.10.  Review  Operations  Plan  (OPLAN),  ATO,  ACO,  Operational  Tasking  (OPTASK) LINK, Special Instructions (SPINS), ROE, Tactical Operations Data (TACOPDAT), Theater Missile Defense (TMD) Plan, lessons learned, aeronautical charts and other mission-specific documents.  Be  familiar  with  coordinate  systems  to  be  employed,  geographical  references (GEOREFS) and conduct area familiarization in the unit’s operating location. 3.9.  Local  Operating  Procedures  (LOP).  Each  unit  will  create  squadron  operating  standards which will further define local procedures for operating in the in-garrison, training environment (T-3).    Theater  or  contingency  SPINS  define  operating  procedures  for  use  in  the  theater  or contingency environment. In the absence of instructions for the CRC contained in the SPINS, the deployed unit will develop operating standards for use in the theater or contingency environment (T-3). 3.9.1.  The DO will sign the LOP and will file it in the Operational Information File (T-3). 3.9.2.  The DO will ensure that the LOP is reviewed every 18 months (T-3). 3.9.2.1.  The DO will sign a memorandum for record (MFR) which certifies the LOP for the next 18 month period (T-3).  Only one MFR may be used to extend the period for the LOP. 3.9.2.2.  Interim  changes  may  be  made  to  the  LOP  which  do  not  cause  the  LOP  to expire.Interim Changes (ICs) will be integrated into the LOP at the next 18 month review period (T-3).  No MFR may be used to extend an LOP with ICs attached. 3.9.3.  Individual  templates  for  weapons  and  surveillance  specialized  briefs  should  be included in the LOP. 3.10.  Voice  Tape  Recording.  Tape  recording  live  missions  is  essential  to  provide  necessary information  concerning  aircraft  accidents,  aircraft  emergencies,  and/or  any  event  resulting  in  a subsequent  investigation.  Tape  recording  also  provides  a  valuable  asset  in  determining  lessons learned for the development of TTPs. 3.10.1.  General.  Various  types  of  tape  recorders  are  available  to  the  CRC  to  satisfy  tape recording  requirements.  Primary  recorders  used  by  the  CRC  are  the  recorder/reproducer (R/R) equipment in the OM and individual cassette tape voice recorders. 3.10.2.  Priorities for Recording Assignments. 3.10.2.1.  The  MCC  determines  which  positions  are  to  be  recorded;  however,  the  MCC may  delegate  this  task  (e.g.,  to  the  SD).    The  priority  of  recording  transmissions  is mission  dependent.    Prioritization  will include  at  a  minimum  the  primary  control  guard   20  AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010 and  primary  aircraft  control  channel  (T-3).    Standard  prioritizations  are  listed  in Attachment 8. 3.10.3.  Operating Responsibilities and Procedures. 3.10.3.1.  All  missions  involving  the  control  of  live  aircraft  will  be  recorded  (T-3).    If there is no R/R or other recording capability available, annotate the fact in the operations logbook, and notify the MCC or DO. 3.10.3.2.  The  DST  prepares  the  recorder  and  manages  the  loading,  unloading,  storage, and  labeling  of  tapes.    The  MCC/SRO  will  ensure  that  the  tape  is  started  prior  to  the assumption of daily duties or ops normal call (T-3). 3.10.3.2.1.  At  the  FTU,  Current  Operations  manages  the  storage  and  labeling  of tapes.  Loading and unloading is the responsibility of equipment checkout personnel and Instructor WD respectively.  The MCC (or Weapons Instructor at the FTU) will ensure  that  the  tape  is  started  prior  to  the  assumption  of  daily  duties  or  ops  normal call (T-3). 3.10.3.3.  Change recording tapes at the end of the mission crew shift change. 3.10.3.4.  Perform  checks  of  the  recorder  at  mission  crew  shift  change  to  ensure  full operation. 3.10.3.5.  Ensure the following is annotated in the operations logbook at the beginning of each duty shift: 3.10.3.5.1.  Tape number. 3.10.3.5.2.  Start number point, if applicable (for voice cassette recorder). 3.10.3.5.3.  Date and ZULU time. 3.10.3.5.4.  Name of individual changing tape (when applicable). 3.10.3.6.  Mark each complete tape with the following: 3.10.3.6.1.  Tape number. 3.10.3.6.2.  Date and time of tape stop. 3.10.3.7.  Ensure  tapes  are  marked,  handled,  and  stored  IAW  DoD  Directive  5200.1R, Information Security and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. 3.10.3.8.  Notify  the  ASO  of  recording  malfunctions.  At  the  FTU  notify  Current Operations. 3.10.4.  Tape Retention. Retain recording tapes for 48 hours for in-garrison training and 30 days  during  combat/contingency  operations.  Recording  tapes  containing  information concerning  an  aircraft  accident/incident  will  be  identified,  marked,  and  retained  separately out of normal rotation usage until the incident is resolved or for a minimum of six months. The MCC or higher authority may direct a tape or tapes be retained for a specific reason. In such  a  case,  mark  the  tape  appropriately  with  the  requester’s  name,  rank,  duty  title, organization, and disposition instructions and retain out of normal rotation usage. 3.11.

The CRC is a highly flexible system with many individual sensor  components  providing  separate,  supporting  capabilities  to  the  overall  system.  Individual components  may  fail  during  operations,  leaving  other  components  intact  and  providing  limited overall capabilities. Refer to Attachment 7 for tactical data reporting of degraded operations. 3.12.1.  Operating  with  limited  radar  capabilities.    Not  every  function  of  the  CRC  requires the use of active radar or IFF/SIF interrogation.  A loss of organic primary or secondary radar can come about either by design (tailored configuration) or by equipment outage. 3.12.1.1.  The MCC must report loss of primary/secondary radar to HHQ (AOC) or unit BS through reporting channels whenever such outage occurs as the result of mechanical failure (T-2).   It  is  the judgment of the MCC or SD on duty to  determine whether live-flight  activity  can  continue  with  degraded  sensors  or  whether  the  CRC  must  terminate activities  until  radar  functions  are  restored  (T-3).    When  subordinate  to  an  AOC  or similar HHQ structure, the MCC will make a recommendation to the AOC based on his or her sound judgment before ceasing operations (T-3).  The MCC will inform the CC of subsequent decisions/actions taken (T-3). 3.12.1.2.  When  the  CRC  is  conducting  weapons  control  operations,  the  SD  will  advise the  MCC  of  the  impact  of  primary  or  secondary  sensor  loss  to  the  safety  of  flight, weighing  the  risk  factor  of  the  mission  involved  against  the  benefits  of  continued operation in degraded conditions (T-3). 3.12.2.  Operating  with  no  radar  capabilities.    If  neither  the  primary  nor  secondary  radar  is functioning,  the  MCC  and  SD  will  determine  whether  advisory  control  is  possible  (T-3).

Battle Staff Overview.  Overall Battle Management (BM) is the responsibility of the Battle Staff (BS) under the direction of the commander. The BS is ultimately responsible for execution of the ATO/ACO under the TACON of the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) through the Chief of Combat Operations (CCO). Supervision of the Mission Crew under the direction of the Commander is normally delegated to the MCC. This paragraph does not apply to FTUs. 4.2.  Battle  Management  (BM)  Responsibilities.  BM  is  the  allocation  or  reallocation  of assigned  assets  for  operations  against  the  enemy  (direct  or  supporting).    BM  is  accomplished through  the  coordination  and  integration  of  the  weapons  and  surveillance  sections.    The  AOC assigns  areas  for  each  BMC2  agency  with  the  ability  to  perform  battle  management  functions.  For  each  BMC2  agency’s  assigned  area,  the  BMC2  agency  (i.e.,  AWACS  or  CRC)  provides control, management, and identification/classification of all airborne tracks, defense of friendly assets, and prosecution with assigned weapons of designated targets entering the assigned area, and  connectivity  with  other  BMC2  elements.    The  assigned  areas  are  known  as  the  Battle Management  Areas  (BMA).    The  BS  and  mission  crew  should  expect  to  be  delegated  the authority  to  operate  in  a  decentralized  execution  mode.    This  authority  may  come  at  any  point during mission operations and therefore is a critical planning objective. 4.2.1.  Battle  Staff.    The  BS  consists  of  the  following  positions:  CC,  normally  the  unit commander and/or the unit DO and the MCC and Battle Staff Coordinator (BSC).   The BS performs the following BM roles and responsibilities: 4.2.1.1.  Maintain maximum flexibility, responsiveness, and timeliness in the application of assigned resources. 4.2.1.2.  Receive  and  understand Commander’s (J/CFACC) guidance and intent. the Joint/Combined  Force  Air  Component 4.2.1.3.  Ensures that the JFACCs plan for CRC operations is executable. 4.2.1.4.  Review AOC guidance and directives, monitor status, develop courses of action and implement guidance as directed by the AOC. 4.2.1.5.  Review  the  mission  objective  and  equipment  status  and  provide  directions  for execution to all operations/support sections. 4.2.1.6.

The  Weapons  section  conducts  the  weapons  control  function  and, under the supervision of the MCC, some TDL management, combat airspace control and battle management functions. The Senior Director (SD) leads Weapons and directs their activities. The SD supervises the Air Weapons Officers (AWO) and Weapons Directors (WD) who perform the weapons  control  and  battle  management  functional  duties.  When  assigned,  an  Air  Defense Artillery Fire Control Officer (ADAFCO) is considered part of the Weapons section. 5.1.1.  The weapons section at the FTU is incorporated in locally established procedures and uses this section as a reference for daily operations and training in congruence with the rest of the document. 5.2.  Weapons  Control  Responsibilities.  Weapons  control  is  the  control  of  offensive  and defensive  counter  air  (OCA/DCA),  air  refueling  (AR)  missions,  dynamic  targeting  (DT), coordination of, combat search and rescue (CSAR) operations, reconnaissance, airlift, electronic attack  (EA),  special  operations,  emergency  aircraft  assistance,  and  direction  of  ADA  Systems. The weapons section is responsible for managing and employing the assigned weapons systems IAW  governing  OPORD,  ATO/ACO,  SPINS  and/or  other  theater  directives.  It  requires  a thorough knowledge of friendly and enemy system capabilities and an understanding of doctrine for the correct and proper application of force at the decisive time and place. 5.2.1.  The Weapons section are subject matter experts in the areas of ROE, theater SPINS, area  familiarization,  and  are  intimately  familiar  with  the  documents  listed  in  Appendix  6, Section A.6.2. 5.2.2.  Weapons control also involves the control of non-kinetic applications of force, such as electronic warfare (EW), tactical reconnaissance (tac recce), show of force (SOF) and show of presence (SOP), etc. 5.3.  Tactical Data Link (TDL) Management.  Data link management is the digital display and transfer of battle management data and commands. It includes operation of the MCE computer, communications  systems,  and  MCE  supporting  databases.  In  the  Weapons  section,  it  involves the use of data link messages to provide surveillance, targeting, and C2 orders through the digital interface  to  provide  maximum  situational  awareness  with  a  limited  amount  of  verbal communication.  Weapons  operators  should  be  proficient  in  the  use  of  weapons  specific  link control functions. 5.4.  Combat  Airspace  Management  Responsibilities.  Airspace  management the implementation of the ACO while providing safe passage advisories to airborne assets within the AOR.    The  Weapons  section  is  familiar  with  ACO  elements  to  include  tanker  anchors,  transit boulevards, air routes, and other ACM to safely and efficiently route aircraft through the AOR in route to their designated working areas.  These ACMs may be required to be created dynamically with the use of Restricted Operating Zones (ROZ), High Density Air Control Zones (HIDACZ), Missile Engagement Zones (MEZ), and so on, and requires flexibility and attention to detail to manage. is AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010   39  5.5.  Battle  Management  (BM)  Responsibilities.  Battle  Management  is  the  allocation  or reallocation  of  assigned  assets  for  operations  against  the  enemy  (direct  or  supporting).  The Weapons  section  exercises  battle  management  by  adjusting  and  managing  tanker  flow,  routing tactical  and  strategic  airlift  through  working  areas,  performing  DT  from  on-call  assets,  and providing recommendations to HHQ on the application of correct assets to dynamic tasks as the ATO cycle progresses. 5.6.

The Surveillance section conducts the surveillance and the tactical data link (TDL) management operations and, under the supervision of the MCC, some airspace control  and  battle  management  functions.    The  ASO  leads  the  surveillance  section  and  directs their  activities.    The  Surveillance  section  at  the  FTU  is  incorporated  in  locally  established procedures and uses this section as reference for daily operations and training. 6.1.1.  As  the  section  most  intimately  involved  with  the  employment  and  use  of  the equipment, the ASO is responsible to the MCC for the reporting and tracking of equipment status and coordinating with the BSC during outages or interruptions. 6.1.2.  Several  duty  positions  involved  with  the  operation  and  employment  of  CRC equipment are assigned to the Surveillance section: AST, DST, ICT, EPT, and the ST. 6.2.  Surveillance  Responsibilities.  The  Surveillance  section  performs the  surveillance function:  the  detection,  tracking,  identification,  and  reporting  of  airborne  entities  within  the CRC’s  assigned  operational  area,  region  or  sector.  Tracking,  ID  and  reporting  procedures  are determined  by  the  J/CFACC  for  the  theater  and  outlined  in  the  appropriate  theater OPLAN/OPORD. 6.2.1.  The  ASO  divides  the  CRC  operational  area  into  sub-areas  and  assigns  an  ST  to conduct surveillance within that airspace. 6.2.2.  Tracks not easily identifiable by the published SPINS and ID plan are referred to the MCC by the ASO for action by HHQ, typically the AOC. 6.3.  Tactical Data Link (TDL) Management.  The data link management is the digital display and  transfer  of  battle  management  data  and  commands.  It  includes  operation  of  the  Modular Control Equipment (MCE) computer, communications systems, and MCE supporting databases. Data  link  management  also  consolidates  sensor  inputs  into  a  recognizable  air  picture  for distribution  over  TDL  and  forwards  that  picture  to  the  AOC  and/or  adjacent  C2  agencies.  The data link management function can be divided into two main responsibilities: 6.3.1.  Database  Management.  Database  management  is  the  loading,  editing,  and display of operations-area relevant points, tracks, and geometry corresponding to active Airspace Control Measures (ACM) IAW the published ACO. Database management is primarily  performed  by  the  DST.    Additionally,  the  DST  acts  as  the  first  contact  for reporting  and  troubleshooting  of  any  equipment  failures,  including  radios,  Operator Console Unit Work Stations (OCUWS), and the Recorder Unit (RU). 6.3.2.  TDL  Management.  TDL  Management  is  the  reception  (from  organic  AN/TPS-75 detection  and  additional  external  sensors),  processing,  and  forwarding  of  the  CRC recognizable  air  picture  (RAP)  to  the  AOC  and  other  BMC2  nodes  to  include  lateral  joint agencies.  TDL Management is primarily performed by the ICT under the supervision of the ASO. 6.4.  Electronic  Protection  Technician  (EPT).  The  EPT  is  responsible  for  implementing appropriate EP actions through the use of the AN/TPS-75 RADAR system displays and switch   48  AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010 actions to ensure optimal performance of the RADAR(s). The EPT section develops the EMCON plan during mission planning and recommends changes as appropriate. 6.5.  Combat  Airspace  Management  Responsibilities.  Airspace  management the implementation  of  the  ACO  while  providing  safe  passage  advisories  to  airborne  assets.    The Surveillance section ensures active ACMs are properly displayed and coordinates the activation and deactivation of ACMs with the SD and MCC.  The Surveillance section is aware of ACMs involved  in  the  identification  process  such  as  known  enemy  airspaces  (point  of  origin  [POO] criteria), minimum risk routes (MRR), safe passage routes, etc. is 6.6.  Battle  Management  (BM)  Responsibilities.  Battle  management  is  the  allocation  or reallocation  of  assigned  assets  for  operations  against  the  enemy  (direct  or  supporting).    The Surveillance  section  is  aware  of  basic  BM  information  to  include  friendly  air  routes, identification  of  friendly  airbases,  basic  capabilities  and  limitations  of  aircraft  to  provide elements of the identification plan (to include ISR assets such as Rivet Joint). 6.7.

General.  The primary method of submitting reports is through an automated system; voice serves as a backup method. 7.1.1.  ICT instructor cadre performs this function at the FTU. 7.2.  Tactical Data Link Operations. 7.2.1.  Link Maintenance.  TDL is maintained as dictated by the JICO and re-established as soon  as  practicable  IAW  theater  circuit  prioritization,  if  lost.    The  controlling  agency  is notified of the loss of the link. 7.2.2.  Termination.    TDLs  are  normally  terminated  only  after  receiving  operational  release from the appropriate controlling authority. 7.2.3.  Emergency Termination. When possible, the controlling authority should be notified if emergency termination of a link becomes necessary or likely. 7.3.  Joint and Air Force Reporting.  Forward reports, such as those listed below (Table 7.1), by  voice,  SIPRNET,  or  text  to  the  appropriate  higher  echelon,  as  required  by  appropriate directives.    Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  publications,  Air  Force  Instructions,  and  appropriate OPORDs/OPLANs established reporting requirements.  The following are representative reports that may be required; this is not all-inclusive and is dependent on mission requirements or theater directives.  All reports must be completed IAW applicable directives (T-0). Table 7.1.  Joint and Air Force Reporting. Report Situation Report (SITREP) OPR CC  Operational Report - 3 (OPREP -3)  CC  Status of Resources  CC/BSC  Purpose Inform AOC of operational plans, unit readiness degradation, and operational situations/summaries, and ultimately keep the JCS, and as appropriate, the CCs of unified and specified commands, the services, and other interested agencies informed of significant situations.  The SITREP may be used to report operational problems, limiting factors, recommended or intended courses of action, and other items not reported elsewhere. It should only report changes in the situation since submission of the last report.  Specific reporting times may be submitted at the originator's discretion or higher echelon authority (HEA) direction.  The OPREP-3 is used by any unit to provide the JFC and appropriate CCs with immediate notification of any incident or event where national interest is not indicated or has not been determined.  The SORTS report is used to provide authoritative   66  AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010 and Training System (SORTS)  Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) 1 Report  In-Flight Report (INFLIGHTREP)  CC/BSC  SD  Intelligence Report (INTREP)  Intel  Intelligence Summary (INTSUM)  Intel  *Electronic Attack Data Message (EDAT)  EPT/AST/ MCC/SD  SD/ ADAFCO  Alert Status for Air and Ground Alerts (ACSAMSTAT) Report, (SAMSTATREP), and SAM Tactical Order (STO) identification, location, and resource information on units and organizations of the U.S. and of designated foreign armed forces.  The NBC-1 is used to provide the observer's initial report giving basic data on a nuclear, biological, or chemical attack.  The INFLIGHTREP is used to report mission results and/or information of tactical or intelligence value.  The voice message is used by pilots/aircrews to give a broad assessment of mission accomplishment and/or any other tactical information sighted of such importance and urgency that the delay, if reported by normal debriefing would negate the usefulness of the information.  The INTREP is used to provide for the joint exchange of information obtained through tactical collection efforts.  The INTREP provides timely information regarding events that could have an immediate and significant effect on current planning and operations, or information that may be of timely interest at the national level.  The INTSUM is used to provide a brief summary of information of intelligence interest covering a specific period of time, as specified by the JFC.  The INTSUM provides a summary of the enemy situation in forward and rear areas, enemy operations and capabilities, and weather and terrain characteristics.  The INTSUM reflects the intelligence staff officers' interpretation and conclusions as to enemy capabilities and probable courses of action.  The EADAT is used to report EA strobe data in the absence of a data link message. Communications Jamming is reported to Intel by the MCC/SD to be forwarded to the AOC via a Joint SIR.  The ACSAMSTAT is used to report the availability and alert status of air defense aircraft and the SAMSTATREP is used to report the availability of friendly SAMs for the management of the joint operations area (JOA) air defense by the AADC.  The STO is used to report the specific Firing Unit (FU) launcher Alert States (AS) states, as well as and ID and engagement authorities for all air breathing threats (ABTs), Cruise Missile threats (CMs), Unmanned Aerial System threats (UAS), Anti-radiation Missile AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010   67  *ABT/TBM Engagement Reports  *Spectrum Interference Resolution (SIR)  Mission Report (MISREP) Tactical Director (TD)/ SD/ ADAFCO  MCC threats (ARM), and Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBMs.) The ABT/TBM Reports will be as complete as possible and submitted to the next higher headquarters upon request or within 30 minutes of initial engagement. PATRIOT fire units will hardcopy all engagements to aid in reporting.  A unit affected by a SIR incident begins an investigation to identify the source and submits a SIR report within 24 hours of the incident.   MCC/SD  The MISREP is used to report mission results and items of intelligence interest in all tactical roles.  The MISREP message is filled out to provide timely reports of mission results (e.g. BDA) and all other intelligence information obtained during post-flight debriefing.  The MISREP is used to report specific results of non-imagery recorded tactical combat missions and sightings made along ingress and egress routes (observed threats/suspicious activity, electromagnetic activity), and overall mission effectiveness.  The MISREP may be used to retransmit or amplify an in-flight report and is submitted to the tasking agency, the requesting unit/agency, and to other interested organizations.   68  AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010 Chapter 8 ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS 8.1.  General.  This  chapter  establishes  the  requirements  and  provides  guidance  for  the maintenance of required publications, records, forms, briefings and documentation. 8.2.

Maintain  forms  a  minimum  of  60  days and  dispose  of  those  records  in  accordance  with  the  Air  Force  Records  Disposition  Schedule (RDS)   Contact supporting records managers for approval as required. located  at  https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. 8.3.  Forms  Requirements.  The  DO  ensures  AF  Form  4145,  Daily  Activity  Log,  AF  Form 4146,  Mission  Briefing  Guide,  DD  Form  1972,  Joint  Tactical  Air  Strike  Request,  DD  Form 1975,  Joint  Tactical  Air  Reconnaissance/Surveillance  Request,  and  FAC  CAS  9-Line  Briefing Form are readily available to meet operational requirements in support of CRC operations. 8.3.1.  AF  Form  4145,  Daily  Activity  Log.  The  MCC  or  crew  leader  is  responsible  for  the Daily  Activity  Log.  The  form  is  required  to  be  completed  and  signed  at  the  completion  of each  operations  crew  shift  and  forwarded  to  the  DO  for  approval  and  signature.  The  daily activity log provides a complete summary of all crew operations for a particular shift and is an important tool for data correlation and analysis. 8.3.2.  AF  Form  4146,  Mission  Briefing  Guide.  Use  the  Mission  Briefing  Guide  to  brief missions, record mission results, and serve as a record of unit control activities. WDs/AWOs use the form for all control activities conducted and forwarded to the MCC or crew leader for review and attachment to AF Form 4145. 8.4.  Operations  Checklists  and  Crew  Aids.  Operations  checklists  are  lists  of  actions  that require mandatory, sequential compliance. 8.4.1.  Three categories of check lists: Normal Checklists (N), Emergency Checklists (E), and Quick Reaction Checklists (Q). 8.4.1.1.  Normal  Checklists  (N)  are  used  for  equipment  power  up/down  and  normal operations and employment. 8.4.1.2.  Emergency  Checklists  (E)  are  used  for  events  that  immediately  threaten personnel, equipment, or aircraft with death, injury or destruction. Emergency checklists are denoted by a banded border. 8.4.1.3.  Quick  Reaction  Checklists  (Q)  are  used  for  situations  that  require  prompt response, but which do not constitute emergency situations. 8.4.2.  Crew Aids are a standard set of documents to facilitate mission execution.  Crew aids are black on white background and contain charts, diagrams, lists, indexes, guides and other unclassified  reference  information  deemed  useful,  but  strict  compliance  is  not  required.  Crew  aids  are  issued  for  specific  duty  positions  (e.g.,  WD,  MCC)  and  are  organized  by distribution  groups.    The  groups  are;  I-Indexes,  X-Emergency  Guides,  D-Directories,  P- AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010   69  Planning Guides, G-General Guides, M-Mission Guides, J-Joint Operations, W-Weapons, S-Surveillance. 8.4.2.1.  The crew aids can be distributed in any manner deemed appropriate by the DO. They  can  be  made  available  on  position  or  each  crewmember  may  be  provided  an individual copy. 8.4.2.2.  All checklists and crew aids are distributed over the HQ ACC/A3YG website, on the AF Portal. The checklists and crew aids are designed to be incorporated into standard 4"x 7" flight crew checklist plastic binders. 8.4.2.3.  Operations  checklists  will  be  available  to  each  operations  crewmember  before declaring the CRC operational or limited operational during peacetime operations (T-3).  During wartime operations, the CRC will not delay activation of operations to satisfy this requirement;  however,  checklists  and  crew  aids  should  be  available  for  operator  use  as soon as possible after declaring the CRC operational or limited operational (T-3). 8.4.2.4.  HQ ACC/A3CG will be responsible for maintaining the checklists and crew aids on HQ ACC/A3CG website, on the AF Portal and will provide the instructions for their use IAW this directive. 8.4.2.5.  Recommended changes to checklists and crew aids will be made using AF Form 847  and  submitted  through  appropriate  channels  (T-3).    HQ  ACC/A3CG  will  review, incorporate  approved  changes  and  post  on  HQ  ACC/A3CG  website,  on  the  AF  Portal.  ACC/A3CG will notify the units of specific changes via separate memorandum/message. 8.4.2.6.  It  is  the individual operations crewmember’s responsibility to  ensure they have and  use  the  current  checklists  and  crew  aids.    The  DO  can  authorize  the  creation  of checklist  and  crew  aid  supplements,  to  include  local  procedures,  as  needed.    The supplements will be IAW the existing format (T-3). 8.4.3.  Administrative  Requirements.  Prepare  and  maintain  operations  checklists  IAW  the following administrative guidelines: 8.4.3.1.  Checklists and crew aids should be incorporated into standard 4"x 7" flight crew checklist binders for use in the OM. 8.4.3.2.  Each  unit  will  develop  internal  review  procedures  to  ensure  current  checklists are  in  use  (T-3).    The  review  will  be  verified  in  writing  (T-3).    All  checklists  will  be reviewed annually (T-3). 8.4.3.2.1.  The first page of each checklist and crew aid binder will contain the date of the last review and the initials of the reviewer (T-3).  The reviewer’s initials signify the checklists and crew aids are current.  All checklists and crew aids will be marked IAW DoD Directive 5200.1-R (T-0). 8.4.3.3.  The checklist titled, “Controlling A/C Emergency”, banded in black will be the first checklist in any binder (T-2). 8.4.3.4.  Checklists  and  crew  aids  will  be  in  the  front  of  the  binder  and  separated  from other material,  if  combined with  other operational  guides or documents, such as locally developed handbooks (T-3).   70  AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010 8.4.3.5.  Personnel  manning  an  operations  position  must  have  in  their  possession  the checklists as indicated by the checklist matrix listed in Attachment 9 (T-3). 8.5.  COMSEC  Requirements.  The  MCC,  through  individual  sections,  ensures  required COMSEC  materials  (Voice  Callsign  List,  codes  and  authenticators)  are  available  to  operations crews.  COMSEC material not maintained in the OIF will be signed out from the unit COMSEC custodian  (T-3).    Issue,  protection,  and  disposition  of  COMSEC  material  will  be  IAW  DoD Directive 5200.1R, AFI 31-401, and Air Force Cryptographic Operational General (AFKAG)-1 (T-0). 8.5.1.  This function is performed by Current Operations at the FTU. 8.6.  Operations  Information  File  (OIF).  The  OIF  is  required  to  ensure  that  information essential  to  the  conduct  of  operations  or  emergency  conditions  are  available.  The  read  file portion  of  the  OIF  centralizes  significant,  time  sensitive  issues  and  procedures  that  are disseminated  to  operations  personnel.  Procedures  for  maintenance  of  the  OIF  are  contained  in applicable  MAJCOM  directives.  The  MCC  (or  DO/ADO  at  FTUs)  is  responsible  to  ensure  all crew members read and initial items contained in the read file. 8.7.  Operations Logbook. 8.7.1.  The Operations logbook is the official record of events that occurred during any live operation, exercise (live or simulated).  The purpose is to maintain an accurate and detailed record of all significant events pertaining to operations occurring during each crew shift.  Of primary  importance  are  events  that  may  result  in  subsequent  investigations.    The  DO  will ensure  the  Operations  Logbook  is  properly  maintained  (T-3).    The  following  procedures apply for all logbooks: 8.7.1.1.  Maintain the logbook in a permanently bound book such as a ledger or a journal. 8.7.1.2.  Classify the logbook SECRET since it contains information concerning actual or exercise  alert  warnings  and  states  of  preparedness,  system  capabilities,  and  other classified  data.    The  logbook  will  be  marked,  handled,  and  stored  IAW  DoD  Directive 5200.1R,  Information  Security  Program  Regulation,  AFI  31-401,  Information  Security Program Management (T-0). 8.7.1.3.  Make entries in the logbook in  black or blue ink.  Do not  erase  entries made in the  logbook.  Correct  errors  in  entries  by  lining  through  the  entry,  placing  individual’s initials at the end of the entry, and re-entering correct information on the next line. 8.7.1.4.  Open  the  logbook  at  0001Z  or  at  the  beginning  of  the  duty  day  and  close  it  at 2400Z or the end of the duty day. Use ZULU time for all entries. 8.7.1.5.  If a change in ZULU day occurs during the tour of duty, close the logbook and reopen it at that time. 8.7.1.6.  When  opening  and  closing  the  logbook  for  the  ZULU  day  or  changing  crews, include the operational crew identifier in the sign-on/off duty line. 8.7.1.7.  It is not necessary to record information  that has already been noted in another authorized document or has been recorded unless it is deemed appropriate for clarity and understanding. AFI13-1CRCV3  21 JANUARY 2010   71  8.7.1.8.  When  using  the  logbook  it  is  not  necessary  to  record  information  that  has already been noted in another authorized document or system or has been recorded unless it is deemed appropriate for clarity, understanding or classification. 8.7.1.8.1.  Time of each entry (using ZULU time). 8.7.1.8.2.  The MCC or DO Designee available will sign at the beginning and end of the  tour  of  duty  (indicating  the  time  on/off  duty  with  a  legible  rank  and  signature) certifying all entries are accurate and reflect a complete record of the tour of duty (T-3). 8.7.1.8.3.
