Knowledge Overview.  5.1.1.  The AF uses a variety of oversized cargo M-series trucks.  The primary purpose varies by vehicle type.      5.1.1.1.  The  primary  purpose  of  the  2-1/2  ton  6  x  6  oversized  cargo  M-series  truck  is primarily  airdrop  recovery  procedures  that  require  the  use  of  vehicles  built  for  adverse terrain.    Other  oversized  cargo  M-series  truck  serve  a  variety  of  purposes  (passenger movement, cargo movement, emergency services support, etc.)  5.2. Overview of Training and Requirements.  5.2.1.  Training objectives:  5.2.1.1.  Given lectures, demonstrations, hands-on driving session and a performance test, trainees will be able to perform operator’s inspection and complete the performance test with zero instructor assists.  5.2.1.2.  Train  and qualify each trainee in  safe operation and preventive maintenance of the various oversized cargo M-series trucks.  5.2.1.3.  This training will ensure the trainee becomes a qualified oversized cargo M-series operator—an operator who has the knowledge and skills to operate an oversized cargo m-series truck in a safe and professional manner.  5.2.2.  Desired learning outcomes:  5.2.2.1.  Understand  the  safety  precautions  to  be  followed  pre-,  during-,  and  post- operation of the oversized cargo M-series trucks.  5.2.2.2.  Understand the purpose of the oversized cargo M-series truck and its role in the mission.  5.2.2.2.1.   Purpose  various  based  on  vehicle  type  (cargo  movement,  passenger movement, emergency services support, etc.).  5.2.2.2.2.   Role  in  the  mission  (Unit/Base/Community  (during  natural  disasters)/Air Force). 5.2.3.  Oversized Cargo M-Series Truck Design.  The design of an oversized cargo M-series truck varies depending on the vehicle type.  Refer to the manufacturer’s operator’s manual for additional information on the specific oversized cargo M-series truck being operated, and to the data plate for safe load capacity guidance.  The oversized cargo M-series truck normally can be identified by the following characteristics:  5.2.3.1.  2-1/2  and 5 Ton Trucks:  5.2.3.1.1.   2.5 ton or 5 ton refers to the maximum payload the vehicle can carry under the worst cross-country conditions.  Under ideal highway conditions, it can carry twice as much.     5.2.3.1.2.   The 6X6 designation means the vehicle has six wheel ends and all six are capable of driving. 5.2.3.1.3.   The truck body provides 270 cubic feet of cargo space.  The side racks have built-in troop’s seats for troop transport. 5.2.3.1.4.   Use either diesel or JP-8 for fuel.  JP-8 should only be used in an emergency and should be mixed with diesel as soon as possible. 5.2.3.1.5.   Tire pressure is checked and adjusted automatically by the CTIS (Central Tire Inflation System). 5.2.3.1.6.   Controls and indicators.  See Table 5.1.      Table 5.1.  2-1/2 and 5 Ton Oversized Cargo M-Series Truck Controls and Indicators.

Located on the right rear side of the cab, it is the plug-in point for an external power service required  to  slave  start  vehicle  when  batteries have become discharged.   5.2.3.2.  The 6x6 System (if applicable).  A vehicle equipped with six wheel drive (6x6) has  the  ability  to  use  all  six  wheels  to  power  itself.    This  increases  traction  which  may enable the operator to safely drive over terrain and road conditions that a conventional two wheel drive (2x2) or four wheel drive (4x4) drive vehicle cannot. 5.2.3.2.1.   Power is supplied to all six wheels through a transfer case or power transfer unit.  6x6 vehicles allow the operator to select different drive modes as necessary. 5.2.3.2.2.   Refer to the manufacturer’s operator’s manual for information on shifting procedures and maintenance.  5.2.3.2.3.   On some 6x6 models, the initial shift from 2x2/4x4 to 6x6 while the vehicle is moving can cause a momentary clunk and ratcheting sound.  These sounds are normal as the front drivetrain comes up to speed and is not cause for concern.   5.3. Vehicle Inspection.  5.3.1.  Pre-trip vehicle inspection test.  Use Attachment 2 as a walk around guide along with AF Form 1800.  5.3.1.1.  The following items must be checked when the vehicle is picked up:    5.3.1.1.1.

Rigging is applying wire rope in various tackle combinations to raise or move loads. Rigging involves  installing the necessary  equipment  to  use the  available effort (AE), and it may or may not produce MA.  5.7.3.1.  Rigging Fundamentals.  5.7.3.1.1.   Fall line.  5.7.3.1.1.1.  A fall line is the winch line that runs from the source of effort to the first block in the tackle.  5.7.3.1.1.2.  There is only one fall line in a simple tackle system.  The amount of force that must be exerted on the fall line relative to the AE must be considered in every problem. 5.7.3.1.1.3.  The  fall  line  force  must  be  less  than  the  capacity  of  the  effort  to accomplish the recovery.        Figure 5.75.  Terminology of Simple Tackle.   5.7.3.1.2.   Return line.  5.7.3.1.2.1.  A return line is a winch line rigged between the block or the winch line from the sheave of a block to the point where the end of the line is attached.  This force is always the same as the fall line force.  5.7.3.1.3.   Dead line.  5.7.3.1.3.1.  A dead line is a line used to attach blocks or other equipment to the load or to an anchor.  To determine the dead line force, multiply the fall line force by the highest number of winch lines supported by the dead line. 5.7.3.1.4.   Fleet angle. 5.7.3.1.4.1.  Achieving even winding of the winch cable on the drum is important for wire rope life and winch operations.  This is best accomplished by working with the proper fleet angle.  5.7.3.1.4.2.  Figure 5.76. displays the wire rope running from a fixed sheave, over floating sheaves, and then onto the surface of a smooth drum.  The fleet angle is defined as the included angle between two lines. 5.7.3.1.4.2.1.  One line is drawn through the middle of the fixed sheave and the drum and perpendicular to the axis of the drum.  5.7.3.1.4.2.2.  A second line is drawn from the flange of the drum to the base of the groove in the fixed sheave.        Figure 5.76.  Fleet Angle.   5.7.3.1.4.3.  There are left and right fleet angles, measured to the left and right of the centerline of the sheave.  The fleet angle should be restricted when wire rope passes over a fixed sheave and onto a drum.  5.7.3.1.4.4.  For the most efficient method and best service, the angle should not exceed 1½ degrees, for most vehicles.  Refer to the equipment operator’s manual for specific information on fleet angles.   Note:    Although  many  vehicles  have  winches  that  can  safely  operate  at  higher  fleet  angles, maximum stability and performance is achieved at lesser fleet angles.  5.7.3.2.  Mechanical Advantage (MA) of tackle.  5.7.3.2.1.   MA  is  needed  whenever  the  load  resistance  is  greater  than  the  AE.  The amount of MA needed is estimated by dividing the load resistance by the AE.  The MA of any simple tackle system is equal to the number of winch lines supporting the load or  the  number  of  winch  lines  that  become  shorter  as  power  is  applied  to  the  winch (Figure 5.77.).  The lines can be attached directly or indirectly through a block.    5.7.3.2.2.   Placement  of  the  block  is  critical  to  gaining  MA.    The  block  must  be attached to the movable load and effort applied in the opposite direction to divide the effort equally over the two lines.  The arc over the lines indicates lines that support the load (Figure 5.77.).  Note:  The 1-to-1 ratio shown has an arc over only one line indicating the block is simply changing the direction of effort.  No MA is gained in this configuration.  Figure 5.77.  Winch Line(s) Mechanical Advantage.   5.7.3.3.  Determine Line Forces:  5.7.3.3.1.   The  following  example  shows  how  to  compute  various  line  forces.    A disabled vehicle had a load resistance of 14 tons (28,000 pounds).  The AE is a winch with  a  maximum  capacity  of  5  tons  (10,000  pounds).    What  MA  must  be  rigged  to recover this vehicle?  What are the line forces?       Figure 5.78.  Determine Line Forces.       Figure 5.79.  4-to-1 Mechanical Advantage.   Note:  If field expedient slings are used as  deadlines, refer to  FM 5-125 to determine sling leg forces.  Field expedient slings are considered slings that are constructed using materiel not part of the recovery vehicle’s BII.   5.7.3.4.  Methods of Rigging:  The rigging techniques used depend on terrain, the type of vehicle,  and  the  distance  between  the  recovery  vehicle  and  the  disabled  vehicle.  Manpower, backup, and lead methods for rigging techniques are discussed below.  5.7.3.4.1.   Manpower method.  The manpower method is used when the winch cable and  other  rigging  equipment  are  lightweight  and  can  be  carried  easily  by  the crewmembers to where they are needed.  This method depends completely on Soldier manpower.  5.7.3.4.2.   Backup method.  The backup method is used when the recovery vehicle can be safely positioned within 20 to 25 feet of the disabled vehicle.   5.7.3.4.2.1.  Pull out enough main winch cable to attach to the disabled vehicle.  5.7.3.4.2.2.  Place the main winch snatch block in the loop of the cable and attach the block to the disabled vehicle.  5.7.3.4.2.3.  Back  up  the  recovery  vehicle,  allowing  the  main  winch  cable  to  be spooled from the winch drum until sufficient cable is removed to obtain maximum winch capacity.  5.7.4.  Cab Raising/Lowering Guidelines for the LMTV (if applicable).    5.7.4.1.  Raising/lowering  cab.    Raising/lowering  the  cab  should  only  be  performed  by qualified and safety minded personnel before procedure.  Note:    Warning  –  Engine  compartment  and  accessories  may  be  extremely  hot  when  engine  is running or has been running recently. Use caution around engine when cab is raised. Failure to comply may result in injury to personnel.  Engine compartment contains a partially exposed fan blade.  Use  extreme  caution  around  front  of  engine.  Failure  to  comply  may  result  in  injury  to personnel.  5.7.4.2.  Raising Cab.  5.7.4.2.1.   Step 1.  Remove quick release pin (1) from switch box cover (2).  5.7.4.2.2.   Step 2.

Note:  Switches must be held in operating position while conducting the raise cab function.       Figure 5.81.  Raising Cab Switch Box (continued).    5.7.4.2.4.   Step 4.  Position and hold CAB switch (5) to RAISE until cab is fully raised.  5.7.4.2.4.1.  Warning – Never raise cab while occupied or when parked uphill on a steep grade.  Failure to comply may result in serious injury or death to personnel.  Ensure both doors are securely closed before cab is raised. 5.7.4.2.4.2.  Do not allow personnel near cab when cab is being raised.  Failure to comply may result in serious injury or death to personnel or damage to equipment.   5.7.4.2.4.3.  Remove all loose objects from cab before raising the cab.  Failure to comply may result in damage to equipment.  Cab height is higher than normal when raised.  Ensure area above and in front of cab is adequate before raising the cab.  Note:  Use backup hydraulic pump if temperature is below  -25° F (-32° C) or if pressing CAB switch does not accomplish step 4.      Figure 5.82.  Raising Cab Switch Box (continued).   5.7.4.3.  Lowering Cab.   5.7.4.3.1.   Step 1.  Position NORMAL OPERATION/AIR TRANSPORT switch (4) to NORMAL OPERATION.  Note:    Warning  –  Ensure  both  doors  are  securely  closed  before  cab  is  lowered.  Do  not  allow personnel near cab when cab is being lowered. Failure to comply may result in serious injury or death to personnel or damage to equipment.      Figure 5.83.  Switch Box.    5.7.4.3.2.   Step  2.    Position  and  hold  CAB  switch  (5)  to  LOWER  until  cab  is  fully lowered.  Note:  Switches must be held in operating position while conducting the various functions.  If the NORMAL OPERATION/AIR TRANSPORT switch is on air transport mode, the cab ride height limit  switch  is  deactivated  and  the  rear  leveler  cylinders  will  completely  retract.  When  the NORMAL OPERATION/AIR TRANSPORT switch is  positioned in  NORMAL OPERATION, the cab will raise automatically to its preset ride height when the master power is ON or the engine is running. If the ignition is on while lowering the cab, it will lower but will automatically raise up to its preset ride height. The rear cylinders will not stay lowered completely.  Use backup hydraulic pump if temperature is below -25° F (-32° C) or if pressing CAB switch does not accomplish step 2.      Figure 5.84.  Switch Box (continued).   5.7.4.3.3.   Step 3.

Start the engine. Test for hydraulic leaks. If  the  vehicle  has  hydraulic  brakes, pump the brake pedal three times. Then apply firm pressure to the pedal and hold for 5 seconds. The pedal should not move.  If it does, there may be a leak or other problem. Brake system. Test parking brake. Fasten safety belt. Set parking brake. Gently  pull  forward  against  parking brake to make sure the parking brake holds. If it doesn't hold vehicle, it is faulty; get it fixed. Test service brake stopping action. Go about 5 miles per hour. Push brake pedal firmly. "Pulling" to one side or the other can mean brake trouble. Any  unusual  brake  pedal  "feel"  or delayed  stopping  action  can  mean trouble. If  the  trainee  finds  anything  unsafe during  the  Vehicle  inspection,  get  it fixed.  Federal  and  state  laws  forbid operating an unsafe vehicle.

Final Air Brake Check  o o o o   o o o o Check air compressor drive belt condition and tightness (if compressor is belt driven). Check  manual  slack  adjusters  on  S-cam brakes.  Note:  Vehicles with automatic slack adjustors still must be checked. Park on level ground and chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes so the operator can move the slack adjusters. Use gloves and pull hard on each slack adjuster that it can be reached. Check  slack  adjuster,  more than  1-inch indicates  adjustments  required  (vehicles  with too much brake slack can be very hard to stop).  Adjust it or have it adjusted. Check  brake  drums  (or  discs),  linings,  and hoses. Test low pressure warning signal. Shut  the  engine  off  when  the  vehicle  has enough  air  pressure  so  that  the  low  pressure warning signal is not on. Turn the electrical power on. Step  on  and  off  the  brake  pedal  to  reduce  air tank pressure. Low air pressure warning signal should come on before the pressure drops to less than 60 psi in the air tank with lowest pressure.   that the  spring  brakes  come  on Check automatically. Chock the wheels. Release  the  parking  brakes  when  enough  air pressure is built up. Shut the engine off. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce the air tank pressure. "Parking brake" knob should pop out when the air  pressure the  manufacturer's specification. Check rate of air pressure buildup Refer  to  manufacturer’s  recommendation  for average buildup time.   If  not  within  recommended  time,  the  air pressure  may  drop  too  low  during  driving operations. Test air leakage rate. falls to  o o o o o  o o  o  With a fully-charged air system (typically 125 o o o o  o o  o o o o o psi). Turn-off the engine. Release  the  service  brake  and  time  the  air pressure drop. The loss rate should be less than 2 psi in one minute for single vehicles. Not less than 3 psi in 1 minute for combination vehicles. Then  apply  90  psi  or  more  with  the  brake pedal. After  the  initial  pressure  drop,  if  the  air pressure falls more than 3 psi in 1 minute for single vehicles. Not more than 4 psi for combination vehicles. Check air compressor governor cut-in and cut-out pressures. Air  compressor  should  start  at  about  100  psi and stop at about 125 psi. Run the engine at a fast idle. Air governor should cut-out the air compressor at about the manufacturer's specified pressure. Engine idling, step on and off brake to reduce air tank pressure. Compressor  should  cut-in  at  manufacturer's specified cut-in pressure.   o       Test parking brake:  Stop the vehicle; put the parking brake on; gently pull against it in low gear to determine if parking brake will hold. Test service brakes. Wait for normal air pressure. Release the parking brake. Move  the  vehicle  forward  slowly  (about  5 mph). Apply the brakes firmly using the brake pedal. Note any vehicle "pulling" to one side, unusual feel, or delayed stopping action.
