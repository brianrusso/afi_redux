General.  Although CCT and STO personnel are separate and distinct Air Force Specialties with unique skill sets and capabilities, they do maintain some similar skill sets. These skill sets are defined as the capability to shoot, move (to include tactical methods of insertion/extraction), and  communicate  during  all  Special  Tactics  (ST)  missions.  Additionally,  all  CCT  and  STO personnel  are  required  to  be  world-wide  deployable,  trained  in  basic  mobility  processes  and operational deployment planning. 1.2.  Policy.  This  instruction  identifies  the  training  requirements  for  CCT  and  STO.  It establishes a benchmark set of training events for commanders to use to increase/maintain depth of  knowledge  and  quantify  task  proficiency  (results  of  training).  Establishment  of  this benchmark  allows training to  be accomplished at  each organizational  level  and to  be evaluated under  comparison  for  effectiveness  while  allowing  for  unit  -unique  training.  Unit  commanders may institute more demanding training criteria to meet mission requirements, and must develop lesson  plans  for  unit-unique  training  requirements,  but  as  a  minimum,  must  report  against  this published standard. Submit proposed changes through  your chain of command to AF/A3O -AS Workflow (SMPT: AF/A3OS.worflow@pentagon.af.mil) on AD Form 847. 1.3.  Program Goals.  The Air Force CCT and STO training program ensures all CCT and STO obtain and maintain the qualification and proficiency needed to  effectively perform  their unit’s mission.  Programs  should  strive  to  fully  prepare  CCT  and  STO  forces  for  wartime  and operational success. Safe, relevant, realistic and thorough training is the best way to prepare for combat  and  other  operational  missions.  The  end  state  of  CCT  and  STO  training  is  complete operational  success  on  the  battlefield  and  objective  areas,  the  fulfillment  of  the  Joint  Forces Commanders intent, and the safe and honorable return from each mission. 1.4.  Waiver  Authority.  Unless  otherwise  specified  in  this  instruction,  HQ  USAF/A3O  -A  is the waiver authority for this instruction. Request waivers to the basic guidance in this instruction through  applicable  training  channels  to  the  MAJCOM/A3  or  equivalent.

Overview.  This  chapter  outlines  the  minimum  requirements  for  qualification  training  and requalification  training  for  CCT  and  STO.  Commanders  will  ensure  CCT/STO  Airmen completing  qualification  and  requalification  training  meet  the  requirements  of  this  chapter. Performance  of  duties  not  directly  related  to  qualification  or  requalification  training  should  be minimized. 2.2.  General  Requirements.  The  primary  method  for  initial  qualification  is  to  complete  the appropriate formal training courses listed in the 1C2 CFETP. Special Tactics Officers must meet all of the initial entry requirements as outlined in the Officer Classification Directory for 13DXB AFSC. Combat Controllers must meet  the initial entry  requirements as outlined in  the Enlisted Classification Directory for 1C2X1. 2.3.  Requalification.  Before  entering  requalification  training,  each  CCT/STO  must  have previously  met  initial  qualification  training  IAW  paragraph  2.2  of  this  document.  CCT/STO airmen requalifying after a five-year break from the career field must attend applicable portions (minus phase I formal dive and freefall training) of the Advanced Skills Training Course (ASTC) at  the  Special  Tactics  Training  Squadron  (STTS)  and  receive  an  initial  STAN/EVAL  IAW AFI13-219 Volume II prior to becoming mission ready IAW paragraph 3.3 of this instruction. AFI13-219V1  23 FEBRUARY 2009   9  Chapter 3 MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING 3.1.  Overview.  This  chapter  establishes  the  minimum  training  requirements  for  completing initial mission ready qualification. 3.2.  General  Requirements.  The  primary  method  of  mission  qualification  is  to  complete  the ASTC  and  unit  specific  training.  Upon  completion  of  unit  specific  training,  CCT/STO  will complete  an  initial  STAN/EVAL  IAW  AFI  13  -219  Volume  II.  At  a  minimum,  unit  specific training will include: 3.2.1.  Initial assignment interview. 3.2.2.  MAJCOM and unit missions and command relationships. 3.2.3.  Operational Risk Management (ORM). 3.2.4.  Mobility procedures and training. 3.2.5.  Review of local publications to include operating instructions and the establishment of a Special Tactics Information File (STIF). 3.2.6.  Completion of required ancillary training. 3.3.  Mission Ready.  CCT/STO are considered mission ready when all of the following apply: 3.3.1.  All requirements in paragraph 3.2 above are met. 3.3.2.  Commanders  assess  that  individuals  are  sufficiently  proficient  to  perform  mission tasks as indicated in the applicable Specialty Training Standard (STS) and this AFI. 3.3.3.  Individuals are not medically restricted from performing the required duty (i.e. duties not involving flight (DNIF)).   10  AFI13-219V1  23 FEBRUARY 2009 Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  Overview.  The  continuation  training  program  provides  CCT/STO  with  the  volume, frequency  and  mix  of  training  necessary  to  maintain  proficiency  in  the  assigned  qualification level. 4.2.  General  Requirements.  Individual  proficiency  may  require  a  greater  number  of  events. Commanders will ensure operators receive sufficient continuation training to maintain individual proficiency.  All  training  requirements  are  derived  from  mission  guidance  letters  (MGL)  and correspond  to  mission  essential  task  lists  (METLs)  and  formal  school  syllabus  training requirements.  Any  training  that  does  not  specifically  support  MAJCOM  and  unit  METLs  or formal school training should be questioned and reviewed by the unit commander. 4.3.  Training  Tasks.  Training  tasks  allow  for  objective  measurement  of  unit  core  task proficiency.  Each  of  the  ST  core,  supporting  and  collateral  tasks  has  associated  training  tasks with  defined  and  measurable  conditions  and  standards.  Each  training  task  has  a  discreet  task identifier which will be loaded in Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) that allows unit commanders  to  effectively  track  unit  training  and  measure  readiness  in  the  unit.  Required training tasks reflect those skills identified by the lead MAJCOM for ST (AFSOC) as critical to all  ST  forces  and  must  be  accomplished  within  the  designated  time  period  to  retain  currency. Unit  commanders  select  and  prioritize  training  tasks  based  upon  the  unit’s  assigned  or  likely missions.  While  unit  commanders  may  mandate  more  stringent  conditions/standards/frequency for the training tasks published within this instruction, they may not impose less stringent ones. 4.3.1.  Currency and Proficiency Training. Proficiency training is conducted to increase skill and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. Currency training is conducted to ensure competence in designated skills and qualifications. The CCT and STO Training Task (Attachment  3)  outline  the  required  condition,  standard,  and  (Attachment  4)  outlines frequency  necessary  to  maintain  currency  and  proficiency.  Frequency  standards  are  based upon a floating 365-day calendar. NOTE: Frequency standards for currency may not be the same as frequency standards for pay-related training items. 4.3.1.1.  Senior CCT and STO fulfilling key staff positions are required to maintain only those  training  currencies  as  outlined  in  Attachment  2  to  this  instruction.  Key  staff personnel are defined as those assigned to MAJCOM staff or higher positions, and others as identified by the MAJCOM, that would not normally be considered required to deploy as an ―operator‖. All CCT/STO assigned to AETC are also considered to be in key staff positions. 4.3.1.2.  If  an  individual  does  not  accomplish  a  given  task  (Attachment  4)  within  the specified  time  period,  the  individual  will  become  non-current  and  must  accomplish  the task  in  the  presence  of  a  trainer  or  certifier  who  is  qualified  in  that  task  in  order  to become current again. 4.3.1.3.  Decertification and Retraining. If the individual is found to be non-proficient in a particular task then the individual will be decertified in that task. Decertification will be annotated in  the individual’s AF  Form  623,  Individual Training Record.  The individual will  be  retrained  and  recertified  to  meet  the  TCS  for  the  applicable  line  item  and  any AFI13-219V1  23 FEBRUARY 2009   11  local,  MAJCOM  and/or  Air  Force  guidance.  Manage  task  certification  and  de-certification IAW AFI 36 -2201 Volume 3, and the applicable CFETP. Airmen that fail to meet the skill level standards IAW the CFETP will be reclassified to a new skill level or AFS  IAW  AFI  36-2101,  Classifying  Military  Personnel  (Officer  and  Enlisted).  Prior  to the  member’s  retraining/recertifying  the  individual  will  not  perform  any  operational missions. 4.3.1.4.  Ancillary tasks: Conduct general Air Force ancillary training IAW AFI 36-2201 Volume  1,  Guidance  Memorandum  on  Ancillary  Training.  Attachment  3  contains standard ARMS identifier codes to be used to track ancillary training for CCT/STO. 4.4.  Core  Skills.  Train in order to be 100 percent successful in  executing tasked missions. ST units  must  be  experts  at  employing  priority  core  skills  in  combat  and  when  called  upon  to perform other missions. CCT and STO have many skills to maintain, and unit commanders must strive for balance in core skill proficiency. Also, whenever possible, tailor and focus training for known or projected missions. Listed below are the core skills for Combat Controllers. Core skills are  those  most  essential  to  accomplishing  the  ST  mission  sets  and  therefore  receive  highest training priority: 4.4.1.  Combat Control Core Skills: 4.4.1.1.  JTAC  Operations/Fire  Support  planning,  guidance  and  control.  Fire  support training should involve difficult battlefield air operations scenarios as well as classroom academics.  Look  for  opportunities  to  train  with  a  variety  of  aerial  attack  platforms  (i.e. bombers,  fighters,  gunships,  helicopters  and  UAVs.)  Incorporate  fire  support  planning, especially  in  the  joint  environment.  Additionally,  conduct  classroom  and  field  training aimed at increasing CCT understanding and proficiency in ―weapons effects‖ especially with emerging munitions. Training in Naval Gunfire and Artillery direction is the lowest fire direction skill priority -- train in these skills as opportunities present themselves. 4.4.1.2.  Air  Traffic  Control.  Maximize  use  of  ATC  simulators.  Integrate  as  many  core skill  training  events  as  possible  into  the  simulator  scenarios  (i.e.  ATC,  JTAC,  CFF  and assault zone operations). 4.4.1.3.  Assault  Zone  (AZ)  Operations.  Train  to  and  practice  airfield  operations  and planning. Make use of exercises and AZ activities for training opportunities. Train with Contingency Response Group (CRG) elements when able on common ―open the airbase‖ skills.  Look  for  opportunities  to  train  in  airfield  seizure  operations  with  joint  force counterparts. 4.4.1.4.  C2  Communications.  Ensure  combat  controllers  are  communications  experts with  each  assigned  radio,  including  state-of-the-art  data  transmission  and  machine-to-machine technology. 4.4.1.5.  Combat/Tactical  Operations  (shoot/move/communicate).  Train  in  field  skills, small  unit  tactics,  light  and  heavy  weaponry,  close  quarter  battle  and  immediate  action drills both mounted and dismounted. 4.4.1.6.  Tactical Survey/Assessment. Train and maintain assault zone assessment/tactical survey  skills.  Additionally,  train  for  mounted  armed  reconnaissance  and  surveillance operations.   12  AFI13-219V1  23 FEBRUARY 2009 4.4.1.7.  Combat  Search  and  Rescue  Operations  (CSAR).  Include  SAR  Security  Team (SST) TTPs in CSAR training events. 4.4.1.8.  Small  Unmanned  Aerial  Systems  (SUAS)  Operations.  Train  on  unit  assigned SUAS. Where possible include them in core skill training events. 4.4.1.9.   Limited Weather Observation. Weather training should be included in all assault zone and air traffic control core skill training events. 4.4.1.10.  Demolitions. World events have forced demolition training back to a core skill requirement  for  all  CCT/STO.  Train  to  be  proficient  with  SOF  counterpart  demolition equipment and TTPs. 4.4.2.  Special Tactics Officer (STO) Training. STOs are first and foremost combat leaders, train  and  employ  them  for  this  role.  Simultaneously,  STOs  must  be  thoroughly  trained  in planning, coordinating and working in an Operations Center (STOC, TOC, JOC, AOC, etc.) Provide  both  the  academic  training  and  practical  experience  to  ensure  STOs  succeed  at  the C2  level.  STOs  need  to  be  familiar  with  all  ST  mission  sets.  Recommend  all  STOs  get initially  certified  as  JTACs  and  receive  training  in  CSAR/PR  operations  as  part  of  ST Advanced  Skills  Training.  Commanders  will  ensure  that  all  of  their  assigned  STOs  receive training  and  exposure  to  CSAR/PR  mission  sets  –  especially  officers  in  ST  units  with assigned PJs who have the greatest opportunity and most pressing need for this training. 4.5.  Supporting Task Training. 4.5.1.  Employment  and  Movement  Skills  Training.  CCT/STO  use  a  variety  of  tactical movement  methods  in  order  to  get  to  the  fight.  Every  effort  should  be  made  to  maintain proficiency  in  these  areas,  but  at  a  minimum  CCT/STO  need  to  be  mission  ready.  When advance  notice  is  available  for  deployments  that  indicate  a  specific  employment  method  is probable,  units  should  make  every  effort  to  become  more  proficient  in  this  employment method. 4.5.1.1.  Tactical primarily HMMWV/GMVs,  ATV/bikes  and  when  applicable,  non-standard  (HI-LUX-type) vehicles. Land  Vehicle  Movement/Convoy  Operations, 4.5.1.2.  Overland/Global  Positioning  (GPS)/Map  &  Compass  Navigation,  Moving  Map and Falcon View. 4.5.1.3.  Helo/Air  Assault  Operations/Alternate  Insertion  Extraction  (AIEs)  (primarily fast rope, rope ladder, airland). 4.5.1.4.  High  Altitude  Low  Opening  (HALO)  and  Static  Line  (SL)  Parachuting Operations. 4.5.1.5.  Amphibious/Over the Beach (OTB) Operations. 4.5.1.6.  Combat (SCUBA) Diving/Swimmer, Open and Closed Circuit. 4.5.1.7.  High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) Parachuting Operations. 4.5.2.  Environmental  Training.  Critical  to  success  is  the  ability  to  move  and  operate  in  a variety  of  environments.  Conduct  environmental  training  in  conjunction  with  core  skill training  and  when  opportunities  present  themselves.  The  priorities  for  training  in  each AFI13-219V1  23 FEBRUARY 2009   13  environment  will  be  determined  by  each  STS  commander  based  on  current/projected taskings,  operator  environmental  experience  levels  and  training  opportunities.  Conduct CBRN  training  as  part  of  both  environmental  and  core  skills  training.  CCT/STO  top environmental training priorities (NOT in order of precedence) are: 4.5.2.1.  Urban. 4.5.2.2.  Mountain/High Altitude. 4.5.2.3.  Cold Weather/Arctic. 4.5.2.4.  Desert. 4.5.2.5.  Water (especially water rescue). 4.5.2.6.  Jungle. 4.5.3.  Operational  Preparation  of  the  Environment.  OPE  is  another  mission  area  getting increased attention and emphasis -- especially in the GWOT environment. Look for training opportunities to expand expertise and capabilities in this growth area. 4.5.4.  Planning.  Absolutely  essential  to  ST  operations  is  the  ability  to  plan  tactical operations. We have had great success with the proven concept of having those that execute an operation play a key role in planning it. Ensure planning skills and techniques are taught, practiced and developed at all levels  -- including joint planning skills and procedures. Each squadron  will  maintain  a  training  program  in  Special  Tactics  Operation  Center  (STOC) operations. 4.6.  Collateral  Tasks.  These  tasks  are  not  necessarily  primary  functions  of  CCT/STO,  but based on their inherent capabilities they are able to accomplish these missions. Training on these events  is  the  lowest  priority  unless  assigned  to  a  unit  that  has  one  of  these  mission  areas  as  a documented task (i.e. 6th SOS). 4.6.1.  Foreign Internal Defense (FID). 4.6.2.  Humanitarian Operations. 4.7.  Tasks,  Conditions,  and  Standards  (TCS).  TCSs  identify  what  is  required  (the  task), under what conditions the task is required to be accomplished (the condition), and how the task is to be accomplished or what the required results are (the standard). Attachment 4 describes the TCSs associated with each training event.   14  AFI13-219V1  23 FEBRUARY 2009 Chapter 5 UPGRADE AND ADVANCE QUALIFICATIONS 5.1.  Overview.  Upgrade  training  (UGT)  leads  to  award  of  the  higher  skill  level  or  special qualification  and  is  designed  to  increase  skills  and  abilities.  AFSC  UGT  requirements  are outlined  in  this  AFI  and  the  1C2  CFETP.  CCT  must  also  meet  the  minimum  requirements outlined  in  AFI  36-2201  Volume  3,  AFI  36  -2101,  the  Officer  Classification  Directory  (OCD) and the Enlisted Classification Directory (ECD). 5.2.  General  Upgrade  Requirements.  CCT  must  complete  all  mandatory training requirements as outlined in their CFETP for award of 3-5-7-9 skill levels. Waiver requirements are described in AFI 36-2201 Vol 3. The basis for the go/no go criteria that the trainee is held to for passing for certification will be in the TCS for the applicable task line number. The Air Force has  set  the  standard  of  3c  IAW  the  qualitative  requirements  proficiency  code  key  from  the specialty  training  standard  as  a  base  requirement  for  the  go/no  go  criteria.  All  CCT/STO maintaining mission ready status must keep current OJT records. Key staff positions as identified in paragraph 4.3.1.1 of this instruction in the rank of E-7 or above for CCT and all STO that are not maintaining mission ready status are not required to maintain current OJT records. CCT/STO will keep training records in a caretaker status to facilitate rapid transition to operational status when assignments change. 5.2.1.  Timelines for upgrade training are determined by unit commanders but must meet the minimum requirements in AFI 36-2201 Volume 3. 5.2.2.  Prior  Service/Sister  Service  accessions  personnel  who  have  completed  all  UGT requirements  may  have  their  time  in  upgrade  training  requirement  waived  for  award  of  5  -level. Commanders may request waivers from HQ USAF/A3O -AS through the 720 OSS and MAJCO M functional manager. 5.2.3.  Task trainers will meet prerequisites outlined in AFI 36 -2201 Volume 2. Trainers will maintain proficiency on all tasks, train only on those tasks they are qualified and current in as documented  in  their  Air  Force  Form  623.  Each  trainer  must  attend  the  Air  Force  Training Course  and  be  recommended  by  their  supervisor.  Trainers  are  selected  based  on  their experience  level  and  ability  to  provide  instruction  to  the  trainees.  They  must  receive  an evaluation  by  another  unit  trainer  prior  to  being  qualified  as  a  trainer.  At  a  minimum, prospective trainers will watch a performance based training task and teach a trainee using a lesson  plan  under  the  control  of  a  qualified  trainer  prior  to  receiving  their  evaluation.  Task certifiers are not required for CCT/STO CFETP items as determined by the Air Force Career Field Managers. 5.2.4.  Task certifiers are required for certain advanced skill qualifications covered by other AFIs  such  as  JTAC  upgrades.  For  these  events,  task  certifiers  will  be  trained  and  certified IAW AFI36-2201 Volume 2 and identified by letter from the unit commander. 5.3.  Advanced  Qualifications:  All  CCT/STO  possessing  advanced  qualifications  will  receive an initial evaluation by a qualified and current trainer and will be assigned in writing by the unit commander.  Dive  supervisor,  static  line  jumpmaster  and  military  freefall  jumpmaster  require attendance at an Air Force or MAJCOM approved formal course of instruction. Other sources of training such as a civilian equivalent course must be approved by the MAJCOM/A3. AFI13-219V1  23 FEBRUARY 2009   15  5.3.1.  Other  advanced  qualifications  are  obtained  through  in-unit  upgrade  following established  MAJCOM  guidelines.  The  AF  Form  803,  Report  of  Task  Evaluations,  or  Stan Eval Evaluator guides will be used to document task qualification if the item is not located in the  AFSC-specific  Job  qualification  Standard  (JQS).  The  AF  Form  1098,  Special  Task Certification  and  Recurring  Training  will  be  used  to  identify  and  document  items  that require  periodic  recurring  evaluation.  All  jumpmaster  qualifications  require  aeronautical orders  to  be  published  and  maintained  in  the  individuals  Aviation  Resource  Management (ARM)  training  folder  as  indicated  in  chapter  six  of  this  instruction.  Commanders  will authorize diving and demolition duty by publishing M-series orders. Where special orders are not appropriate, commanders will appoint individuals in writing. 5.3.2.  Skills not common to all operators in the unit and used in operational missions will be tracked on an in-house generated product known as a letter of X’s’. Units will develop their own letter of X’s based on their mission needs. This  product  is  not  an official document to annotate skill qualifications but an expedient tool for mission planning and team assignment. 5.3.3.  Joint  Terminal  Attack  Control  (JTAC)  initial  training,  evaluation,  currency  and advanced  qualifications  and  documentation  (instructor/evaluator)  will  be IAW  AFI  13  -112 Volume  1,  Joint  Terminal  Attack  Controller  (JTAC)  Training  Program  and  AFI  13-112 Volume  2,  Joint  Terminal  Attack  Controller  (JTAC)  Standardization/Evaluation  Program and Chapter 6 of this instruction.   16  AFI13-219V1  23 FEBRUARY 2009 Chapter 6 DOCUMENTATION 6.1.  Overview.  The  AF  Form  623  is  the  primary  document  for  annotating  initial  and  upgrade training.  Mission  essential  currency  training  requirements  are  normally  documented  in  the Aviation  Resource  Management  System  (ARMS).  JTAC  training  is  documented  in  a  JTAC training folder IAW AFI 13-112 Volume 1 and AFI 13-112 Volume 2. 6.2.  General  Requirements.  Procedures for the documentation of training are outlined below. If  guidance  for  documentation  in  this  instruction  conflicts  with  existing  or  newly  published instructions,  the  governing  AFI  will  take  precedence.  Specifically,  AFI  36-2201  Volumes  1-3 mandate  various  training  and  documentation  requirements  utilizing  prescribed  forms.  AFI  13-112 Volume 1 and AFI 13-112 Volume 2 govern JTAC training and documentation, and AFI 11-410,  Personnel  Parachute  Operations,  and  11-402,  Aviation  and  Parachutist  Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, govern ARMS documentation requirements and procedures. 6.3.  Air Force Form 623.  The primary document for annotating initial and upgrade training is the AF Form 623. CCT in the rank of E-6 and below and STO in the rank of O-4 and below that are  not  assigned  to  key  staff  positions  (STO  only)  as  identified  in  paragraph  4.3.1.1  of  this instruction are required to maintain AF Form 623. The AF Form 623 is divided into tabs which are labeled at the bottom of the cover page. Each label should start with the top tab and run form left to right. 6.3.1.  Tab 1 – CFETP. Maintain the 1C2X1 CCT/STO CFETP at tab 1. AF Form 797,  Job Qualification Standard Continuation Sheet, will be maintained behind the CFETP. This form is used to list training tasks not listed in the CFETP, such as tactics, techniques, equipment and/or employment methods. 6.3.2.  Tab  2  -  AF  Form  623a,  On-the-Job  Training  Record  Continuation  Sheet.  This  form (or  equivalent)  is  used  for  those  comments  specified  by  AFI  36-2201.  Initial  evaluations, break  in  training,  lack  of  training  capability  or  situations  interfering  with  a  members  UGT will  be  documented.  Individuals  in  upgrade  training  (UGT)  will  file  Extension  Course Institute (ECI) Form 9, Volume Review Exercise, and ECI Form 34, Certification of Course Completion, on top of the CFETP. Remove these forms when UGT is complete. 6.3.3.  Tab 3 – Ancillary Training. Ancillary training reports (i.e. ARMS or Web Application products) are maintained under this tab. However, UTM and/or Aviation Resource Managers may track ancillary training in ARMS or STARTS/ST Web and place a memorandum behind the  tab  indicating  the  action.  AF  Form  1098,  will  be  placed  behind  the  ancillary  training report. This form is used to record recurring training to include re-certification for tasks not tracked  in  ARMS,  examples  are  range  control  officer,  Mobile  Microwave  Landing  System (MMLS), coxswain etc. 6.3.4.  Tab 4 - AFSOC Form 10, Individual Dive Record. Individuals may document training on  AFSOC  Form  10,  US  Navy  Dive  Reporting  System  (DRS)  print  out  or  ARMS  report posted in this tab. If not maintained in this tab, indicate using a memorandum where the data is maintained. AFI13-219V1  23 FEBRUARY 2009   17  6.3.5.  Tab 5 -AF Form 803, Task Evaluation Form.

ARMS  Reports.  The Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) is the official Air Force approved database for tracking all mission essential training tasks for CCT/STO operators IAW  AFI  11-401,  Aviation  Management,  and  AFI  11-421,  Aviation  Resource  Management. ARMS are a versatile tool that provides commanders, team leaders, supervisors, and individuals with a record of ground/jump/flying training accomplishments and a measurement of currencies. The Aviation Resource Manager will: 6.4.1.  Monitor, maintain, and update the ARMS database with  the current  Task  Identifiers, frequency and volume requirements within this publication based on an annual training cycle (Jan– Dec). 6.4.2.  Maintain  and  update  Unit  Training  Accomplishment  report  (TAR)  to  reflect  current training in ARMS. 6.4.3.  Track Operator’s training and provides ARM products on an ―as needed‖ basis. At a minimum ARM personnel will maintain a copy of the Individual Training Summary (ITS) or other  ARMS/Browser  training  products  on  each  active  aircrew/jump  member  assigned  to their respective unit on a monthly basis. Upon PCS/PCA, a copy of the most current ITS will be placed in the member’s 6-Part ARM training folder (listed below) for individual to hand-carry to  next  unit of assignment. Upon arrival,  they must turn in  their ARM  training folder within  10  days  of  assignment  to  the  unit  ARM  personnel.  ARM  personnel  must  ensure  the ARMS database is updated according to the Individual Training Summary once the HARM office has in processed the member. 6.4.4.  Maintain ARM training folder on each active aircrew/jump member assigned. Ensure each folder has a Privacy Act sticker. Using a 6 -part folder, the items to be contained are as follows: 6.4.4.1.  Part 1 - In/Out  Processing (Checklist, PCS Orders, PCS ITS, Pay Briefing, and other documents, as needed.). 6.4.4.2.
