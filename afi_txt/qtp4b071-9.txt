Criterion Objective: Notes: Given a source of ionizing radiation and installation inventory, determine hazards presented to workers and general public successfully completing all checklist items with NO trainer assistance. Identifying sources of ionizing radiation typically fall on the installation radiation safety officer (IRSO), and requires a technician to do no more than consult the radioactive material inventory maintained by the IRSO.  Under some circumstances a technician may be required to identify new hazards that will need to be reported to the IRSO.  New sources may be reported from a shop supervisor or identified during routine or special surveillance.  The purpose of this objective is not to measure radiation levels, as that is performed elsewhere.  Instead it is meant to determine if radiation is present, and how it is produced; either from radioactive material, such as Cs-137, or from another process, such is in an an x-ray tube head.      1 AFQTP 4B071-9                                                                                Craftsman Training Guide:  Ionizing Radiation    TASK STEPS  1.  Determine if device/material contains radioactive material or  produces radiation through other means.1 2.  Identify device/material on RAM inventory.2  3.  Record all pertinent information if necessary.3  4.  Determine potential population at risk.4    LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:       NOTES:  1.  Devices containing radioactive material should be labeled with radioactive sticker and isotope contained within.  Serial number of source and equipment will be recorded to compare to the inventory.  2.  X-Ray tubes should be labeled with a radiation sticker, if KvP and mA settings are not labeled on machine, other sources of intel should be used, such as an interview with the operator.  3.  If device/material is not listed on the installation inventory, record all pertinent information to report to IRSO.  This includes, but is not limited to:   Manufacturer   Model   Serial number of device   Source isotope, activity, and date activity was measured   Serial number of radiation source (if applicable)   Machine parameters (KvP, mA, duration of exposure) (if applicable)   Using organization   Location: Bldg #, Room # for both use and storage areas (if different)  4.  Take in to consideration operators/users, adjacent rooms and areas, and if area is accessible by the general public.  This is necessary when determining priority for special surveillance.     2  AFQTP 4B071-9                                                                                Craftsman Training Guide:  Ionizing Radiation  TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS                                    STS Line Item 4.9.2.6:  Identify radiological/nuclear hazards 1.

Measurement points typically include:   At the operator’s location inside the X-ray room   Outside the door to the X-ray room   Exposure room door   In adjacent waiting areas and/or offices   On the other side of the wall from the chest cassette holder   Along exterior of walls, focusing on the door area   Locations above and below the room, if occupied   Film pass through opening  2.  Device Settings   Use a high kilovolt peak (kVp) setting that is appropriate for the exposure.   Use the highest  milliamperes (mA) setting that is appropriate for the exposure  3.  Take measurements at each location of interest:   Tube head oriented for a table shot (vertical position pointed downward toward the table)   Tube head oriented for a chest X-ray (horizontal position pointed at the wall, source to film distance of 72 inches)   3 feet above floor   30 cm (12 inches) from surface for radiation fields penetrating surfaces (like walls)  4.  The technician should take the shot in the same manner they would for that type of x-ray  5.  Calculate and check to see that no location exceeds standards:   Consider occupancy factors (length of time someone might stay at that location)   To find the yearly exposure, find the number of films exposed per week (see formula below)     Standard is 100mr/yr    Also need to consider radiation exposures in radiation worker areas.       6.  Survey results shall include:   A description or drawing of each measurement location   Measured dose or contamination levels at each location   The type, model number, serial number and calibration date of the instrument   Name of individual performing the survey   Date and time of the survey and applicable comments  7.  Use a high kilovolt peak (kVp) setting that is appropriate for the exposure.  Formula: scatter reading (mR/hr) × number of films/wk × sec/film mR/wk =XAnnual = T  ×   (50 wkyr3600 sec/hrn) × [∑i=0Xi(survey)mAsi(survey)] × Wi    XAnnual  = Total annual exposure in mR/yr for a single location (all configurations) T = Occupancy Factor:  fraction of time spent at surveyed locations (NCRP 147, etc.) i = information specific to a particular machine configuration (i.e., chest film, etc.) Xi(survey) = Measured Integrated Exposure in mR for specific location/configuration mAsAnnual = mAs setting for measured shot (from radiation technician) W = Workload:  Average Total mAs per week mAs/wk for specific configuration.
