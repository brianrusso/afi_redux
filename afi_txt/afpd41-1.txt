BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCEAIR FORCE POLICY DIRECTIVE 41-115 APRIL 1994Health ServicesHEALTH CARE PROGRAMS ANDRESOURCESNOTICE: This publication is available digitally on the SAF/AAD WWW site at: http://afpubs.hq.af.mil.If you lack access, contact your Publishing Distribution Office (PDO).OPR: HQ USAF/SGH  (Col Harry F. Laws II)  Certified by:  HQ USAF/SG(Lt Gen Alexander M. Sloan)Pages: 8Distribution: F1. The Air Force depends on its Medical Service to help maintain a fit and vital force, save life and limb,prevent undue suffering, and preserve military strength during contingencies.  As much as possible, theAir Force Medical Service (AFMS) must also care for authorized beneficiaries who are not on active duty.This directive outlines policies needed to carry out these responsibilities.2. The AFMS will use resources efficiently while making sure people get appropriate health care--fromthe right source and for the proper amount of time.  The  Air  Force will also use these resources to pro-mote health and a healthy environment,  and to support the goals and objectives of the AFMS.3. In delivering health care, the AFMS will meet or exceed Federal or state requirements and industrystandards.4. The AFMS will make sure military medical units are ready to respond to contingencies.5. The organizational structure and environment within the AFMS will promote personal developmentand career satisfaction for its personnel.6. Following are established responsibilities and authorities:6.1. The Office of the Air Force Surgeon General (HQ USAF/SG) provides policies governing healthcare, delivery of health services, and medical readiness.  HQ USAF/SG determines and validatesresource requirements, and allocates resources to complete AFMS missions.  HQ USAF/SG alsoensures AFMS’s readiness, evaluates resource use and policy, and offers the Air Force’s medical viewson policies or       legislation to the Department of Defense (DoD).6.2. Major command (MAJCOM) surgeons allocate resources to military treatment facilities (MTF)to make sure personnel are organized, trained, and equipped for peace and war.  MAJCOM surgeonsguide and monitor the MTFs to obtain the best  health care possible with available resources.  Theyalso help collect and    report data to higher headquarters.2   15 APRIL 19946.3. MTF commanders are responsible for all MTF resources and collections.  They identify needsand manage resources to care for eligible people under priorities prescribed by law.  Through theMAJCOM surgeons, they also identify unresourced  patient needs and priorities to HQ USAF/SG.They make sure medical personnel are trained and other resources are available for contingencies inpeace and war.6.4. HQ USAF/REM and NGB/SG develop and maintain standards for medical readiness within theirrespective components.7. This policy applies to HQ USAF/SG, MAJCOM surgeons’ offices, Air Force MTFs, and the AirReserve’s medical components.8. See Attachment 1 for measures of compliance to this policy.9. See Attachment 2 for a listing of terminology.10. See Attachment 3 for a listing of related directives and instructions.ALEXANDER M. SLOAN,  Lt General, USAF, MCSurgeon General   15 APRIL 19943Attachment 1MEASURING COMPLIANCE WITH POLICYA1.1. HQ USAF/SG will measure success in making efficient use of medical resources by evaluatingefficiency as measured by the Cost Per Medical Work Unit (MWU) and the overall rate of expendituregrowth through the use of Expenditure Targets.  Also, the overall health of personnel will be measured bythe noneffectiveness rate.A1.1.1. The Air Force can collect information on the Cost Per MWU (attachment 1) from the Medi-cal Expense and Performance Reporting System, Retrospective Case Mix Analysis System(RCMAS), and the Operating Budget Ledger (OBL).  Specifically, financial obligation informationwill be derived from Program Element Code (PEC)       87792 (Station Hospitals and Clinics) and PEC87711 (Medical Centers) of the  OBL.  The Cost Per MWU using PECs 87792 and 87711 reflect thosecosts most closely associated with the delivery of health care.  The Air Force will measure Cost PerMWU as a ratio of costs to MWUs generated.A1.1.2. To determine the health status of the forces on active duty, HQ USAF/SG can use the RCS:HAF-SG(M)7118, Report of Patients, which shows the number of bed days per 1,000 active dutymembers.  It will display this noneffectiveness rate as monthly lost days per 1,000 active duty mem-bers.  The goal is a downward trend, which reflects fewer noneffective  days lost to hospitalizationAttachment 2.A1.1.3. After the Air Force has established Expenditure Targets (ET) or spendline Attachment 3,obligation information can be collected from the CHAMPUS Catchment Area Billing Report and theOperating Budget Ledger (OBL).  The ET will involve establishment of a predetermined budget(combination Direct Care and CHAMPUS dollars) for the health services provided to a defined popu-lation (eligible beneficiaries as derived from the Defense Medical Information System (DMIS) for agiven time period (fiscal year).  The Air Force will measure a percentage deviation (plus or minus)from the established targets.4   15 APRIL 1994Figure A1.1. Sample Metric of Cost per Medical Work Unit (MWU).Figure A1.2.

Thisnumber is the average CW for all patients and reflects the average relative resource consumption perpatient.  This is a numeric way to calculate the complexity and level of resource intensity of the caredelivered.Case Weight (CW).—An adjustment to the diagnostic related group (DRG) relative weight to accountfor individual patient differences within the same DRG.  Differences could be a prolonged length of stayor a transfer in or out of a facility.  For example, an uncomplicated DRG 9, Spinal Disorders and Injuries,has a CW of 3.2092, but a prolonged complicated DRG 9 might have a CW of 15.1824 or higher.Diagnostic Related Group (DRG).—A set of related diseases and disorders of the body.  There are over500 DRGs that encompass all diagnostic categories and diagnoses.Diagnostic Relative Weight.—Based on historical cost data, each diagnostic related group (DRG) isassigned a numeric value that reflects the relative resource consumption for that DRG.Dollars/Relative Case Mix Index.—This ratio provides the cost of the overall patient load adjusted forthe average complexity of care needed.  Improvements, such as more efficient use of money for the samecomplexity of cases, or for providing care to more complex cases with the same amount of money, arereflected in a downward trend.Relative Case Mix Index (RCMI).— Changes in current medical practice may dictate change indiagnostic related group (DRG) weights.  DRG weights are periodically adjusted to reflect these changes,limiting the ability to compare case mix indexes (CMI) over time.  DoD Health Affairs provides anadjustment factor that statistically corrects each adjustment back to a base year, thus allowing comparisonover time.  The RCMI is the CMI divided by this adjustment factor.   15 APRIL 19947Attachment 3RELATED DIRECTIVES AND INSTRUCTIONSImplementing PublicationsTitle 10 U.S.C. 8013, Secretary of the Air Force,Designee Program,  April 6, 1991 Public Law 97-174, Veterans’ Administration and Department of Defense Health Resources Sharing andEmergency Operations Act Policy Guidelines on the DoD Coordinated Care Program, May 4, 1992DoD Instruction 6010.12, Military-Civilian Health Service Partnership Program,  October 22, 1987 DoD Directive 6010.13, Medical Expense and Performance  Reporting System for Fixed Military Medi-cal and Dental Treatment Facilities, February 3, 1986 DoD Instruction 6010.15, Third Party Collection Program , March 7, 1991DoD Directive 6010.17, National Disaster Medical System, December  28,1988DoD Instruction 6010.18, CHAMPUS Health Care Finder and Participating Provider Program, Novem-ber 9, 1989  DoD Directive 6015.5,  Joint Use of Military Health  and Medical Facilities and Services, February 5,1981DoD  Instruction  6015.20,  Changes  in  Services  Provided  at  Military  Medical  Treatment  Facilities,December 3, 1992DoD Instruction 6025.12, Use of Joint Healthcare Manpower Standards , March 1994DoD Directive 6310.7, Medical Care of Foreign Personnel  Subject to the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-zation Status of Forces Agreement, December 18, 1962DoD Directive 6480.5 Military Blood Program June 16, 1972Interfacing Publications DoD Manual 7110.1-M With Change 1,  Department of Defense Budget Guidance Manual,  May 1990DoD Manual 7220.9-M, Department of Defense Accounting Manual, October 1983JCS Pub 4-02, Doctrine for Health Service Support in Joint Operations, No ChangeVolume I, Annex F,  War and Mobilization Plan, July 1988Policy and Guidance and Joint Commission on the  Accreditation of Healthcare  Organization’s Accredi-tation Manual, No ChangeInterfacing Departmental PublicationsAFI 10-201, Status of Resources and Training Systems (SORTS), (formerly AFR 55-15) AFI 10-401, Operation Plan and Concept Plan Development and Implementation, (formerly AFRs  28-3,28-4, 28-5AFPD 32-40, Disaster Preparedness, (formerly AFR 355-1)8   15 APRIL 1994AFPD 38-1, Organization, (formerly AFR 26-2)AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower  Requirements, (formerly AFRs 25-5 and 26-1, Volume 3)AFM 67-1, Volume V, Air Force Medical Materiel Management System, No ChangeNOTE:Other related policies are in AFPDs 41-2, Medical Support, and 44-1, Medical Operations.
