Applying the Snow and Ice Control Plan (S&ICP). 1.1.1.  Ground  Support.  Installations  with  over  150  millimeters  (6  inches)  of  average annual  snowfall  will  maintain  a  S&ICP  and  form  a  snow  and  ice  control  committee (S&ICC).  For  installations  which  receive  less  than  150  millimeters  (6  inches)  of  average annual  snowfall, the installation commander will create plans  and committees to  meet  their specific needs. (T-1) 1.1.2.  Aircraft Support.  Specific anti-icing/deicing procedures for aircraft maintenance are maintained  in  the  technical  orders  (TO)  for  each  type  of  aircraft.  A  forum  similar  to  the S&ICC should be used to coordinate the aircraft  anti-icing/deicing  program.  Note:  Aircraft anti-icing/deicing  products  and  general  procedures  are  listed  in  TO  42C-1-2,  Anti-Icing,Deicing and Defrosting of Parked Aircraft. 1.2.  Snow  and  Ice  Control  (S&IC)  Objective.  Begin  runway  S&IC  operations  removal  just prior  to,  or  at  the  onset  of,  snowfall  or  icing  conditions  to  provide  continuous  bare  pavement. Installations  without  a  flying  mission  will  establish  when  S&IC  operations  should  begin according  to  mission  requirements.  The  snow  control  center  (SCC),  command  post,  Airfield Management (ATCT)  must  maintain  close communications at all times. (T-3) (AM),  and  Air  Traffic  Control  Tower 1.3.  Supporting  the  Mission.  Maintain  continuous  mission  capability  by  removing  snow  and ice from airfield and base pavements. Judge the success of the program by the safe movement of aircraft and vehicles during inclement winter weather. 1.4.  Prioritizing  Snow  Removal.  S&IC  from  all  paved  surfaces  typically  cannot  be accomplished  simultaneously;  therefore,  three  priorities  are  established  to  ensure  S&IC operations  are  accomplished  in  order  of  relative  mission  importance  and  publicized  to  avoid misunderstandings among base agencies. Priorities can be changed when directed by the S&ICC chair,  in  the  best  interest  of  flight  safety  and/or  airfield  mission  requirements.  Joint  basing priorities will be determined during the S&ICC meeting. (T-1)  Maps will be color-coded in the following  manner:  Priority  1:  Red;  Priority  2:  Yellow;  Priority  3:  Green.  (T-2).  For  safe operation  of  vehicles  and  equipment,  establish  a  primary  access  route  to  and  from  the  airfield. (T-2).  Establish  priorities  in  accordance  with  the  following  guidelines.  (T-2).  (Note:  Priority areas  may  be  different  for  those  bases  without  an  active  airfield.  Joint  base  operations  will comply  with  this  instruction  as  much  as  possible,  taking  into  account  multiple  missions  and/or runways. (T-1) The S&ICP should be flexible to allow for separate mission operations: (T3) 1.4.1.  Priority 1 (Red): 1.4.1.1.  Primary active runway and associated underrun/overrun. 1.4.1.2.  Primary runway accesses to taxiways and alert facilities. 1.4.1.3.  Apron accesses to taxiways. 1.4.1.4.  Aircraft rescue and firefighting equipment lanes. AFI32-1002  22 JANUARY 2015   5  1.4.1.5.  Access roads to and from emergency facilities, e.g., hospital and fire emergency services, special weapons/ammunition storage facilities, aircraft refueling points, aircraft arresting systems and other primary mission facilities. 1.4.1.6.  For  safe  operations,  establish  Navigational  Aids  (NAVAIDS)  for  the  primary active  runway  and  associated  access  roads  to  and  from  the  runway  and  to  emergency facilities, e.g., hospital, fire emergency services. 1.4.2.  Priority 2 (Yellow): 1.4.2.1.  Secondary runways and associated underrun/overrun, and taxiways. 1.4.2.2.  Aircraft parking aprons and remaining aircraft movement areas. 1.4.2.3.  Access roads to secondary mission facilities and primary base streets. 1.4.2.4.  NAVAIDs and/or associated access roads not categorized as Priority 1. 1.4.3.  Priority 3 (Green): 1.4.3.1.  All  other  areas,  including  military  family  housing.  Privatized  family  housing (PFH) area S&IC obligations will be determined during the S&ICC meeting and will be in accordance with ground lease, operating agreement and other military family housing privatization (MFHP) transaction documents. 1.5.  Using  References  and  Resources.  All  S&IC  activities  that  affect  the  environment  must comply  with  AFPD  32-70,  Environmental  Quality.  (T-2)  Allowance  Standard  (AS)  464,  Civil Engineer  –  Operations  Flight  Support  Equipment,  and  AS  010,  Vehicles  Owned  by  the  United States  Air  Force  for  Permanent  Bases,  help  determine  the  type  and  amount  of  equipment authorized for S&IC. Federal  Aviation Administration Advisory Circular (FAA AC) 150/5200- 30C,  Airport  Winter  Safety  and  Operations,  and  FAA  AC  150/5220-20,  Airport  Snow  and  Ice Control  Equipment,  use  abrasives  (sand)  only  in  emergency  conditions  to  improve  traction  on airfield  surfaces.  Guidance  on  pollution  prevention/best  management  practices  (P2/BMP)  is available  at  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  website  for  Pollution,  Prevention,  Best Practices, and Conservation: http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/tpol.html. If possible, S&IC vehicle operators  should  review  the  “Snow  and  Ice  Control  Techniques”  training  available  at  the  Air Force  Civil  Engineer  Center  (AFCEC)  Civil  Engineer  Virtual  Learning  Center  (VLC): https://afcesa.csd.disa.mil.  Installations  that  receive  more  than  900  millimeters  (36  inches)  of average  annual  snowfall,  as  stated  in  the  surface  observation  climatic  summary  maintained  by the  local  weather  flight  or  supporting  operational  weather  squadron  (for  the  entire  reporting period), will earn a manpower variance  for S&IC  (see AFI 38-201, Management of Manpower Requirements  and  Authorizations).  Use  this  earned  manpower  to  hire  extra  workers.  (T-3) Installations may also use service contracts to augment their snow removal team, as approved by the Base Civil Engineer (BCE).   6  AFI32-1002  22 JANUARY 2015 Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Give higher priority to training after winters with below-average snowfall. Provide the following: 3.1.1.1.  VLC  training:  https://afcesa.csd.disa.mil.  Ensure  each  member  of  the  S&IC team reviews the training course “Snow and Ice Control Techniques” at least once prior to  the  beginning  of  the  snow  season.  The  service  provider  will  ensure  snow  removal operators  are  adequately  trained,  the  training  is  documented,  and  training  is  reviewed annually. (T-3) 3.1.1.2.  Formal classroom lectures, discussion periods, and Web-based training. (T-3) 3.1.1.3.  Provide  hands-on  operation  training  for  all  S&IC  equipment.  Perform  practice runs  with  the  equipment  using  typical  operation  scenarios.  Substitute  water  for  liquid deicers to reproduce realistic operations. (T-3) 3.1.1.4.  Contracted  operations  must  be  familiar  with  the  S&ICP  and  will  follow  the requirements of the specific S&ICP for the installation as approved by the BCE. (T-3) 3.1.1.5.  Instruct  all  operators  on  effective  and  efficient  anti-icing/deicing  methods  with minimal  product  use.  Instruction  must  cover  product  usage  issues,  personal  safety, P2/BMPs,  environmental  impact,  and  impact  on  aircraft,  weapon  systems,  and  airfield infrastructure. (T-3) 3.1.1.6.  Tabletop  exercises  using  miniature  equipment  on  airdrome  layouts  to  simulate operations and reduce training costs. (T-3) 3.1.1.7.  Operator  maintenance  responsibilities,  including  fuel,  fluid,  supply  locations, repair techniques, and heavy equipment maintenance reporting procedures. (T-3) 3.1.1.8.  Instruct the  operators  on  communication  procedures  and  right-of-way information. Each operator must be trained on the procedures to follow if the radio signal is lost between the operator, snow control, the ATCT, and the airfield snow removal lead. (T-3) 3.1.1.9.  Details of the S&ICP, emphasizing the order of priorities. (T-3) 3.1.1.10.  Conduct  both  a  daytime  and  nighttime  airfield  and  base  familiarization  tour, highlighting  locations  where  problems  are  likely.  The  airfield  and  base  familiarization tour  should  identify  such  obstructions  as  aircraft  airfield  lighting  systems,  aircraft arresting cables and recessed arresting systems,  aircraft fuel  hydrant  and  valve pits, fire hydrants,  railroad  crossings,  utility  holes,  curb  and  gutter  systems,  and  any  other obstructions  that  may  be  covered  and  difficult  to  see  during  snow  removal  operations.   (T-3) 3.1.1.11.  Define the following information: duty location, duty hours, duty uniform, shift schedules, and notification procedures. (T-3)   14  AFI32-1002  22 JANUARY 2015 3.1.1.12.  Permit  attendance  at  technology-sharing  seminars  and  workshops  with  other military  bases  and  governmental  agencies  (e.g.,  Snow  Symposium  in  Buffalo,  New York). (T-3) 3.1.2.  Safety and Health. 3.1.2.1.  Units must comply with all vehicle licensing, personal protective equipment, and medical  requirement  policies.  All  equipment  operators,  military  or  civilian,  must  meet minimum  training  requirements  before  licensing.  Employ  over-hires  early  enough  to allow time for medical clearance examinations and operator training. (T-3) 3.1.2.2.  S&IC  operations  and  working  conditions  are  hazardous.  Anticipate  damage  to snow equipment and attachments due to hidden obstructions; damage can be minimized by  educating  operators  ahead  of  time  on  these  hidden  hazards.  Ensure  all  personnel comply with established safety procedures when operating deicing equipment. (T-3) 3.2.  Snow Removal Readiness.  All equipment must be mechanically sound and operational by 1  September.  Equipment  status  must  be  available  for  the  pre-season  meeting.  Heated  storage facilities should be used to increase equipment life, reduce maintenance costs, and ensure rapid response. (T-3) 3.2.1.  Perform  pre-season  operational  checks,  including  practice  runs  that  resemble  real winter  operations  as  closely  as  possible.  Report  all  discrepancies  to  logistics  (vehicle maintenance) for corrective actions. (T-3) 3.2.2.  Install, inspect, and perform operational tests on all snow control radios. (T-3) 3.2.3.  Conduct  run-up  and  operational  checks  when  the  temperature  drops  below  freezing. (T-3) 3.2.4.  Adjust  and  calibrate  all  S&IC  equipment  attachments.  Load  ballast  and  install  tire chains (if necessary) prior to S&IC operations. (T-3) 3.2.5.  Equip  each  vehicle  with  required  support  materials  such  as  shovels,  shear  pins,  ice scrapers, fire extinguisher, and tool kits as required. (T-3) 3.2.6.  Use  wear-resistant  tungsten  carbide  cutting  edges  to  reduce  maintenance.  (T-3)  CAUTION:  Tungsten  carbide  cutting  edges  may  be  incompatible  with  some  in-pavement lighting fixtures. 3.2.7.  Use  broom  cores  with  steel  or  poly  bristles,  or  a  combination  of  both.  (T-3) CAUTION:  Loss  of  steel  bristles  increases  foreign  object  damage  potential,  so  minimize loss by trying various brands and storing snow brooms indoors.  It  is  not  necessary or cost-effective to replace steel bristles with poly bristles until after they are worn down. Magnetic sweepers should be used to remove steel bristle residue from the airfield. 3.2.8.  Place  vehicle  call  signs,  airfield  and  base  maps,  snow  removal  priorities,  operator manuals, and/or spreader settings in the equipment for the operator’s reference. (T-3) 3.3.  Obtaining Materials  and Parts.  The heavy repair superintendent procures adequate shop stocks  of  S&IC  supplies  by  15  September  each  year.  Establish  minimum  levels  for  each  item, arrange for on-call items, and identify shortages by 31 May each year. (T-3) AFI32-1002  22 JANUARY 2015   15  3.4.  Protecting  Air  Force  Property.  The  heavy  repair  superintendent,  in  conjunction  with representatives  from  AM,  flying  operations,  aircraft  maintenance  and  other  organizations deemed appropriate, specifies "safety zones" around key assets and includes this information in the S&ICP. Snow removal vehicles will not operate within these safety zones.  (T-2) 3.4.1.  Environment.  The  heavy  repair  superintendent  works  cooperatively  with  the  asset management  flight  chief  to  ensure  applications  of  anti-icing/deicing  products  are  in accordance  with  local,  state,  and  Clean  Water  Act  (CWA)  SW  provisions.  The  military family housing privatization project owner (MFHP PO) must comply with all applicable laws including CWA SW provisions. (T-0) The Air Force assumes no enforcement or supervisory responsibilities. The MFHP PO will be liable for all costs associated with compliance.  (T2) 3.4.2.  Infrastructure.  Infrastructure  crews  mark  all  obstructions  that  could  damage  or  be damaged by S&IC equipment. During the pre-season inspection, emphasis must be placed on marking  drainage  culverts,  catch  basins,  manhole  covers,  fire  hydrants,  airfield  lighting, electrical/electronic equipment enclosures, parking lot edges, curbs, and roadway drop-offs. (T2) 3.4.3.  Airfield  Lighting.  Non-metal  markers  may  be  used  to  identify  taxiway  lights.  FAA AC  150/5345-53C,  Airport  Lighting  Equipment  Certification  Program,  provides  the  name and address of marker manufacturers (these manufacturers do not supply markers suitable for identifying  taxiway  lights  buried  in  snow).  If  you  experience  excessive  damage  to  in-pavement taxiway lights, consider purchasing "snowplow-resistant" lighting. Also watch for corrosion  and  deterioration  of  underground  cables  that  may  result  from  long-term  or excessive use of non-urea ice control products. 3.4.4.  Facilities.  S&IC  equipment  operators  will  maintain  sufficient  clearance  around facilities  to  prevent  damaging  the  facility  and/or  snow  removal  equipment.  Operators  will observe the safe clearance distances as specified in the installation’s S&ICP.  (T-2) 3.5.  Streamlining  Operations.  Civil  engineer  personnel  should  be  aware  of  snow  removal physical  constraints.  Bumper  blocks,  elevated  utility  manholes  in  pavements,  congested  or enclosed  parking  arrangements,  lack  of  road  shoulders,  and  dead-end  or  cul-de-sac  streets  can severely  hamper  operations.  Minimize  these  adverse  conditions  through  continuous  and coordinated  communication.  The  programs  flight  chief  and  chief  of  the  project  management element  shall  coordinate  maintainability  checklists  and  drawings  for  upcoming  projects  with operations flight S&IC equipment operators.  (T-3) 3.6.  Establishing  the  Snow  Control  Center  (SCC).  The  SCC  is  a  focal  point  for  all  S&IC activities. Equip the SCC with: 3.6.1.  At least two class “A” telephone extensions for calling snow removal personnel. (T-1) 3.6.2.  At  least  one  radio  transceiver  or  remote.  A  dedicated  net  channel  should  be established for snow removal communications, when possible. (T-1) 3.6.3.  Dispatch boards displaying the nomenclature, vehicle registration numbers, operator, vehicle status, radio call sign, vehicle’s dispatched location, and any comments. (T-1) 3.6.4.  Airfield  and  main  base  maps  with  color-coded  priorities,  status,  and  runway  surface conditions. (T-1) 3.6.5.  Personnel rosters showing duty status and recall information. (T-1)   16  AFI32-1002  22 JANUARY 2015 3.6.6.  Charts identifying current weather conditions and the forecast. (T-1) 3.6.7.  Alternate  sources  of  equipment  and  personnel  to  support  contingencies.  Include instructions  for  renting  equipment  or  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  mutual  support agreements with regional active or reserve units. (T-1) AFI32-1002  22 JANUARY 2015   17  Chapter 4 SNOW AND ICE CONTROL OPERATIONS 4.1.  Maintaining  Communications.  All  personnel  operating  in  the  controlled  movement  area will  maintain  two-way  radio  communication  with  the  ATCT.  Radios  equipped  with  headsets may  be  used  to  offset  the  high  noise  levels  generated  by  snow  removal  equipment.  ATCT requests  to  clear  off  the  runway  must  allow  enough  time  for  the  snow  team  supervisor  to physically check the entire runway. The S&ICP must outline specific procedures when the radio signal  is  lost  between  the  ATCT  and  a  snow  removal  vehicle  operator.  All  operators  must  be trained in these specific procedures.  (T-3) 4.2.  Facility  Managers.  Facility managers or OPR are tasked with clearing snow from around their facility using shovels, small rotary blowers, or small tractor-mounted plows. This includes removing snow from areas around aircraft hangars and shelters, grounding points, parked aircraft (within  defined  safety  zone),  NAVAIDs,  the  aircraft  arresting  system  building,  and  other  areas that  cannot  safely  be  cleared  using  larger  snow  removal  equipment.  Facility  managers  are responsible  for  clearing  snow  from  nearby  fire  hydrants  and  the  faces  of  all  facility  signs. Facility managers will use only approved deicing chemicals near the airfield. (T-3) 4.3.  Airfield  Ice  Control.  The BCE will select  individuals in  the S&IC  chain  of command to make airfield pavement deicing decisions. Selection will be based on duty position, experience, and  environmental  awareness.  The  decision  to  use  ice  control  chemicals  will  be  based  on  the weather  forecast,  flying  schedule, and environmental considerations. The SCC should  carefully monitor  both  use  and  issue  of  ice  control  chemicals  and  log  the  quantities  and  locations  used. Refer to paragraph 5.4. (T-3) 4.3.1.  Ice-Control  Products.  Use  only  installation-approved  products  on  the  airfield  for anti-icing/deicing.  Consult  your  installation’s  asset  management  flight  chief  to  ensure products comply with all federal, state, and local environmental policies. Hazardous material purchases  and  accumulation  of  expired  shelf  life  materials  should  be  minimized.  (T-3) CAUTION: The National  Stock Number  for ice control product  is  a  generic stock  number encompassing  all  anti-icing/deicing  chemicals.  Installations  must  ensure  all  deicing chemicals are compatible when purchasing additional products. 4.3.2.  Anti-icing/Deicing  Products  Storage.  Anti-icing/deicing  products  should  be  stored in  an  enclosed  shelter,  if  possible.  A  properly  stored  anti-icing/deicing  product  reduces degradation  caused  by  exposure  to  the  weather.  Storing  solids  or  abrasives  under  shelter prevents moisture absorption that may freeze the stockpile in cold weather. (T-3)  Liquid ice-control  products  stored  in  tanks  must  comply  with  AFI  32-7001,  Environmental Management. (T-1) Potassium acetate product should be stored in polyethylene or stainless-steel tanks. Use of potassium acetate as an anti-icing agent is recommended as an excellent means of reducing total product usage. (T-3) 4.3.3.  Environmental  Impact.  Minimize  use  of  ice  control  product  to  protect  the environment, aircraft and weapon systems, and airfield infrastructure, weapon storage areas, missile alert and launch facilities, and to control the cost of airfield deicing activities. 4.3.3.1.  Minimize  the  use  of  glycol-based  products.  Urea-based  Anti-icing/deicing products will not be used on Air Force installations. Rely on alternative materials that are   18  AFI32-1002  22 JANUARY 2015 safer  for  the  environment,  such  as  potassium  acetate,  sodium  formate,  and  sodium acetate.  Excessive  glycol  and  urea  use  could  degrade  waterways.  CAUTION:  Ensure potassium  acetate  is  used  as  recommended  by  the  manufacturer.  There  are  documented cases  of  potassium  acetate  causing  increased  groundwater  contamination  and  adversely effecting underground electrical circuits where the insulation is in poor condition. 4.3.4.  Abrasives.  Use abrasives (sand) as necessary to improve traction on airfield surfaces. Excerpts from FAA AC 150/5200-30C for abrasives use is stated in paragraphs 4.3.4.1 and 4.3.4.2. (T-2) 4.3.4.1.  All  sands do not  perform  the same.  In  general,  the  greater the quantity of sand applied,  the  greater  the  increase  in  traction.  Fine  sands  show  superior  performance  on warmer  ice  (>20  Fahrenheit  [°F]  [-7  Celsius  (°C)]),  while  coarser  sands  show  superior performance  on  colder  ice  (<15  °F  [-9  °C]).  For  the  purpose  of  this  guidance,  sand retained on a #30 sieve is  considered “coarse,” and sand passing through a #30 sieve is considered “fine”. 4.3.4.2.  Table 4.1 provides the standard gradation for sand. Friction-improving material applied  to  airfield  pavements  will  consist  of  washed  granular  particles  free  of  stones, loam, clay debris,  and chloride salts or other corrosive substances. The pH of the water solution  containing  the  material  must  be  approximately  neutral  (pH  7).  Material  must meet the following gradation using standard sieves conforming to American Society for Testing  and  Materials  (ASTM)  E11,  Standard  Specification  for  Woven  Wire  Test  Sieve Cloth and Test Sieves. Table 4.1.  Standard Gradation for Sand. Sieve Designation 0.04 Percent by Weight Passing 100 8 16 50 80 97–100 30–60 0–10 0–2 4.4.  Snow  Clearing  Principles.  Snow  clearing  principles  outlined  in  FAA  AC  150/5200-30, Airport Winter Safety and Operations shall be employed.  (T-0) 4.5.  Snow Disposal.  The S&ICP will specify how and where large quantities of snow are to be disposed.  Two common approaches are as follows: 4.5.1.  Melting  Pits  or  Portable  Melters.      At  those  locations  where  large  snow  fall  events occur, CE should consider the installation of melting pits or procurement of portable melters as an efficient and economical solution to expensive snow hauling. 4.5.2.  Identifying Disposal Sites.  If there is insufficient space for storing snow near areas to be cleared and no melting or flushing means are available, hauling to a disposal site may be necessary. If deemed necessary, the disposal site should be selected before winter sets in and  AFI32-1002  22 JANUARY 2015   19  identified  in  the  S&ICP.  The  selection  process  should  at  least  consider  the  following:  (1) disposal sites do not compromise aircraft operations, airfield NAVAIDs, airfield traffic, and ATCT operations such as ATCT line-of-sight requirements; (2) sites have adequate drainage capability;  and  (3)  sites  offer,  if  required,  environmental  mitigation  of  captured  chemicals.
