(Note:  All  references  to  “days”  in  this  publication  are  to  “calendar days” unless specifically noted otherwise.) 1.3.1.  Initial  Qualification  Training  (IQT).  This  training  is  necessary  to  qualify  aircrew for  duties  as  a  FP  or  I-2  ICSO  in  the  T-1A  aircraft.  See  Chapter  2  for  IQT  program requirements. (T-2). 1.3.2.  Mission Qualification Training (MQT).  This training is necessary to upgrade T-1A FPs to IPs, and T-1 I-1 ICSO candidates who are CRS qualified to T-1 I-1 mission qualified INs  [instructor  navigator  (ICSO)].  In  this  phase,  upgrades  are  only  accomplished  with  a MAJCOM-approved syllabus. See Chapter 3 for MQT program requirements. (T-2). 1.3.3.  Continuation  Training  (CT).  This training ensures qualified aircrew maintain their proficiency and currency in T-1A aircraft. It provides minimum ground and flight training for aircrew  while  also  developing  the  instructor  force  and  certifying  aircrew  in  unit  and  local AFI11-2T-1V1  15 JULY 2015   9  area  requirements.  Individual  aircrew  CT  requirements  are  based  on  unit  assignment  as inexperienced or experienced. See Chapter 4 for CT program requirements. (T-2). 1.3.3.1.  Experienced  or  Inexperienced  Designation.  Squadron  commanders  will designate all pilots and CSOs as experienced or inexperienced as follows: 1.3.3.1.1.  Experienced. T-1A aircrew who meet the following criteria are designated as experienced after squadron commander certification: (T-2). 1.3.3.1.1.1.  IPs  certified  as  MR  with  150  rated  hours  primary  or  instructor military  flight  time  in  the  aircraft  and  600  hours  total  rated  military  fixed-wing time  and  ICSOs  certified  as  MR  with  a  previous  major  weapon  system  (MWS) instructor rating and 50 rated hours instructor flight time in the T-1A or, (T-2). 1.3.3.1.1.2.  IPs  certified  as  MR  with  250  rated  hours  primary  or  instructor military  flight  time  in  the  aircraft  and  450  hours  total  rated  military  fixed-wing time and ICSOs certified as MR with 250 rated hours primary flight time and 100 rated  hours  instructor  flight  time  in  the  T-1A.Note:  For  the  purpose  of  this instruction, the wing commander, vice wing commander, OG commander, deputy OG  commander,  squadron  commander,  and  squadron  DO  are  designated  as experienced pilots/CSOs. (T-2). 1.3.3.1.2.  Inexperienced. Aircrew who do not qualify as experienced or who are not certified as such by the squadron commander are considered inexperienced. Aircrew designated  as  inexperienced  will  progress  through  a  program  managed  by  the  flight commander to develop sound flying and instructional skills. Flight commanders will tailor each program based on the individual’s past flying experience and performance during IQT and MQT. No time limit is established to transition from inexperienced to experienced. (T-2). 1.3.4.  Specialized  Training.  This  training  is  necessary  to  carry  out  the  unit’s  assigned missions  but  is  not  required  of  every  crewmember.  One  example  of  specialized  training  is functional  check  flight  (FCF)  pilot.  Individuals  recognized  by  the  unit  will  accomplish appropriate formal course training to qualify personnel in these specialized areas, or comply with locally developed syllabi and squadron-developed training programs. (T-2). 1.4.  Training Concepts and Procedures. 1.4.1.  Squadron  commanders  will  ensure  training  programs  are  designed  to  achieve  the highest  degree  of  qualification  and  proficiency  consistent  with  flight  safety  and  resource availability. (T-2). 1.4.2.  Unless  specifically  directed,  the  squadron  commander  determines  the  level  of supervision  required  to  accomplish  in-flight  training.  If  the  mission  objectives  include introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, an IP and ICSO may be required.  If  mission  objectives  require  direct  supervision,  a  squadron  supervisor  may  be warranted. (T-2). 1.5.  Training Records and Reports.  Units will: 1.5.1.  Maintain an aircrew training folder for each assigned or attached aircrew member. The training folder includes records of individual training to include TI, BIP, specialized training, and  certifications  and  is  maintained  according  to  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1;  AFI  11-202,   10  AFI11-2T-1V1  15 JULY 2015 Volume  2,  Aircrew  Standardization/Evaluation  Program;  and  the  RDS.  (T-2).    AF  Form 4348s  and  any  training  not  yet  completed  are  the  only  documents  required  in  the  training folder. (T-2). 1.5.1.1.  For  each  certification  listed  on  the  squadron  letter  of  Xs,  units  will  maintain documentation on an AF Form 4348 according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2. (AF Form 4348 is prescribed in AFI 11-202, Volume 2. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out  the  form.)    Once  training  that  requires  a  certification  is  complete,  the  signed  4348 becomes  the  source  document  for  the  completion  of  that  training.  Once  the  signed  AF Form  4348  is  placed  in  the  training  folder,  corresponding  training  records  may  be removed at the unit’s discretion. (T-2). 1.5.1.2.  Certification documents maintained in other locations (supervisor of flying, etc.) must also be annotated on the AF Form 4348. (T-2). 1.5.2.  Use  AF  Form  4293,  Student  Activity  Record,  to  document  training  and  any  unusual occurrence that could affect student progress. Instructors should annotate areas of difficulty. See Attachment 2 for instructions on filling out AF Form 4293. (T-2). 1.5.3.  Document  training  in  ARMS  using  the  forms  specified  in  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1. Track the following information for all aircrew, as applicable: (T-2). 1.5.3.1.  Ground training dates accomplished and expiration dates. (T-2). 1.5.3.2.

The squadron commander certifies aircrew training  and certification items appropriate for the unit’s missions on a monthly Letter of Xs according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1. See Attachment 4 of this instruction for a sample Letter of Xs. (T-2). Note: The squadron DO may accomplish the monthly review and certify the Letter of Xs if the squadron commander is not available. 1.12.  Fuel Conservation.  It is the responsibility of all aircrew to conserve fuel to the maximum extent possible. Individual crewmembers and supervisors at all levels will manage aviation fuel as  a  limited  commodity  and  precious  resource.  Fuel  optimization  is  considered  throughout  all phases of mission planning and execution. Once the objectives of training are complete, sorties are terminated at the earliest opportunity. Adherence to average sortie duration is not the driving factor of whether to land the aircraft or continue the mission.   12  AFI11-2T-1V1  15 JULY 2015 Chapter 2 INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING 2.1.

This  chapter  outlines  the  minimum  training  considered  necessary  to  maintain  a viable  T-1  aircrew  corps  to  meet  mission  demands.  Judicious  scheduling  of  CT  is  required  to develop  aircrew and  ensure training standardization. Sufficient flying hours are included in  the annual  FHP  to  allow  every  qualified  aircrew  member  to  accomplish  all  events  and  currencies listed in this chapter. Squadron commanders will ensure the squadron FHP is managed to afford all aircrews ample opportunity to complete required CT. (T-2). 4.2.  Training Cycle.  Semiannual CT training cycles are 1 January to 30 June and 1 July to 31 December. Semiannual requirements are reviewed at the end of each cycle. 4.3.  CT Administration. 4.3.1.  Meetings. 4.3.1.1.  Squadron  commanders  will  direct  and  supervise  quarterly  CT  meetings  for aircrew  members.  (T-2).  The  purpose  of  these  meetings  is  to  discuss  standardization, safety, mission-related topics, instructional techniques, grading practices, and to increase general  knowledge.  A  CRM  topic  or  scenario  should  be  discussed  in  each  CT  meeting referring to core concepts from AFI 11-290. (T-2). 4.3.1.2.  Attendance  at  CT  meetings  is  mandatory.  (T-2).  Squadron  commanders determine the conditions that will excuse attendance. (T-2). The unit determines a method to  track  attendance  as  part  of  the  go/no-go  process  for  flight.  (T-2).  Individuals  not available for CT meetings will read the meeting minutes or be briefed by  an operations supervisor before their next flight. 4.3.2.  Requirements.  Minimum  requirements  are  identified  in  this  chapter,  but  units  may direct  additional  training  in  a  supplement  to  this  instruction  as  necessary  for  individual requirements. (T-2). ID sorties are the primary means for building and maintaining instructor force  proficiency.  Squadron  commanders  will  develop  ID  sortie  profiles  that  detail  the minimum events and currency maneuvers T-1 aircrew must accomplish on each sortie. (T-2). 4.3.3.  Prorating  End-of-Cycle  Requirements.  At  the  end  of  the  training  cycle,  the squadron commander may prorate training requirements according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, for aircrew members who were not available for flying duties. 4.3.3.1.  Prorate only to adjust for genuine circumstances of training nonavailability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies. (T-2). 4.3.3.2.  Base  prorating  on  consecutive  days  of  nonflying  in  the  training  cycle  (applies separately  for  each  period  of  nonflying).  Use  the  prorating  allowance  in  Table  4.1  to determine the number of months to be prorated based on each period of consecutive days of nonflying. (T-2). 4.3.3.3.  If  IQT  is  reaccomplished,  restart  the  individual’s  training  cycle  at  a  prorated share following IQT completion. (T-2).   18  AFI11-2T-1V1  15 JULY 2015 4.3.3.4.  Round  off  prorated  numbers  resulting  in  fractions  of  less  than  1/2  to  the  next lower whole number, but do not prorate any requirement below 1. (T-2). 4.3.3.5.  For  prorating  purposes,  newly  assigned  or  converted  aircrew  and  aircrew achieving qualification after the 15th of the month should be in CT on the 1st day of the following month. (T-2). Events and sorties for the remainder of the training cycle may be prorated.  (T-2). Table 4.1.  Prorating Allowance. I T E M 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 A   B   Consecutive Days of Nonflying Months of Proration 0 - 15 16 - 45 46 - 75 76 - 105 106 - 135 136 - 165 166 - 180 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 4.3.4.  Failure to Complete Annual and Semiannual CT Requirements: 4.3.4.1.  Aircrew  members  who  fail  to  maintain  physiological  and  medical  certification, ground  training,  or  flying  training  requirements  according  to  Table  4.4  are  placed  in NMR  or  non-basic  aircraft  qualified  (N-BAQ)  status,  as  applicable.  Note:  Instructor certification is not automatically lost for failure to complete flying training requirements according to paragraph 3.9.2. They will not fly in the new training cycle until a review is  completed  to  determine  the  cause  of  the  deficiency  and  if  additional  training  is required. 4.3.4.2.  The OG commander (AETC/A3V for MAJCOM flight examiners) is reviewing and waiver authority. (T-2). The reviewer should consider the type and magnitude of the deficiency  and  the  individual’s  experience  level  to  determine  if  additional  training, increased  supervision,  or  a  waiver  to  the  previous  training  cycle  requirements  is warranted. Document waivers, with justification, in the individual’s training folder. (T-2). 4.3.4.3.  Refer  to  AFI  11-402,  Aviation  and  Parachutist  Service,  Aeronautical  Ratings and Aviation Badges, for guidance on aviation suspension. 4.3.5.  Multiple  Qualifications.

Aircrew  Categories  and  Training  Requirements.  All  aircrew  members  will maintain minimum requirements according to AFI 11-202, Volumes 1 and 2; AFI 11-2T-1, Volume 2; and this instruction.  For initial crediting of flying training event currencies, each applicable event listed in Table  4.3 is accomplished during TI or prior to MR certification. AFI11-2T-1V1  15 JULY 2015   19  Additionally,  there  is  not  a  requirement  to  establish  a  reference  date  for  semiannual  sortie and event requirements listed in Table 4.4 prior to MR certification. 4.3.6.1.  IPs  and  INs  (ICSOs).  Squadron  commanders  may  assign  BMC  IPs  to  MR training  status  upon  completion  of  TI  and  squadron  commander  instructor  certification. BMC  ICSOs  may  be  assigned  MR  status  upon  completion  of  MQT  and  squadron commander  instructor  certification.  In  addition  to  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1,  training requirements, MR aircrew must accomplish recurring ground training; semiannual sortie and event; and currency requirements prescribed in Tables 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 to maintain MR status. 4.3.6.2.  FPs.  Squadron  commanders  may  assign  FPs  to  BAQ  training  status  upon completion  of  TI.  In  addition  to  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1,  training  requirements,  BAQ aircrew  must  accomplish  recurring  ground  training  prescribed  in  Table  4.2,  currency requirements  prescribed  in  Table  4.3,  and  semiannual  EP/CRM  training  prescribed  in Table 4.4. 4.3.6.2.1.  Restrictions.  FPs  may  not  fly  simulated  EPs,  touch-and-goes,  traffic pattern  stalls,  formation,  airdrop,  low-level,  air  refueling  (AR)  or  AI  events  without an IP occupying a pilot seat. 4.4.  Periodic Emergency Procedures and Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training: 4.4.1.  All pilots, to include FPs and senior officer pilots, will accomplish semiannual EP and CRM simulator training based on experience level, as described in  paragraph  1.3.3 and as prescribed  in  Table  4.4.  All  CRS  CSOs  accomplish  annual  EP  and  CRM  training  as prescribed in Table 4.4. Accomplish the mission in the simulator with a certified simulator instructor (CSI). According to AETCI 11-203, Civilian Flying Training Simulator Instruction Program,  if  there  is  not  a  CSI  available,  a  simulator-certified  T-1A  IP  may  administer  the simulator mission. IPs may take credit for an EP and CRM simulator when administering the simulator. If semiannual or annual requirements are not met, aircrew will not fly until EP and CRM  training  is  accomplished.  Note:  Pilot  weather  category  (PWC)  requirements  may  be met during EP and CRM simulator training (see paragraph 4.8). Note: Experienced IPs may log semiannual EP and CRM simulator events with a qualified ICSO occupying the copilot seat. 4.4.2.  Because  of  local  emergency  scenarios,  a  locally  generated  simulator  EP  and  CRM instructor  guide  is  used  when  administering  the  simulator.  The  simulator  mission  must include: (T-2). 4.4.2.1.  All critical action procedures and selected noncritical action emergencies. 4.4.2.2.  A cross section of thrust-deficient situations. 4.4.2.3.

At  least  one  CRM  practice  scenario  will  be  briefed,  accomplished,  and debriefed, using CRM core concepts from AFI 11-290. 4.4.3.  All  crew  positions  must  attend  a  CRM  refresher  each  calendar  year.  Track  this training in ARMS. 4.5.  TI  Training  (NA  for  ICSOs).  The local  pilot upgrade process  starts with  TI.  During TI, skills learned during IQT and MQT are applied to the local flying environment. New pilots will fly  a  local  familiarization  mission  prior  to  the  specific  TI  category  missions.  The  local familiarization  mission  will  focus  on  local  departure,  military  operating  areas,  recovery,  and pattern  operations.  The  local  familiarization  mission  should  be  designed  to  ensure  pilots  are familiar  with  general  local  flight  conditions  prior  to  TI  training.  Specific  TI  category  missions will emphasize local constraints, review common pilot errors, and highlight use of local anchors and tracks, routes, and bases. 4.5.1.  Pilots  in  TI  fly  with  assistant  flight  commanders  and  above,  check  pilots,  or experienced pilots designated by the squadron commander. 4.5.1.1.  (479  FTG  only)  Pilots  will  fly  all  TI  sorties  with  experienced  instructors,  of “like” crew position, as designated by the squadron commander. (T-2). During TI, both the new and experienced pilots occupy the pilots seats, unless noted otherwise. 4.5.2.  Pilots will not perform instructor duties or the unit mission prior to completing TI. 4.5.2.1.  Pilots  will  accomplish  the  CSO-modified  aircraft  differences  training  prior  to operating CSO-modified aircraft during TI. 4.5.3.  TI is recorded in the training folder. 4.5.4.  TI sorties are logged as training support sorties and may meet CT requirements during the period in which they are flown. As a minimum, fly the following missions: 4.5.4.1.  Local familiarization (must be flown first and may be flown in combination with any of the specific category missions). 4.5.4.2.  Transition. 4.5.4.3.  High-level navigation (should be flown as an out and back). 4.5.4.4.  Low-level navigation or airdrop (may be flown single-ship or formation). Note: A  CRS  qualified  ICSO  may  occupy  the  copilot  seat  on  single-ship  only  low-level navigation; however, an experienced IP will occupy the jump seat. 4.5.4.5.  AR (does not apply to NAS Pensacola T-1 operations). 4.5.5.  When applicable,  these missions may be combined if all training objectives are met. TI  sorties  include  normal  operations  and  emergency  situations  in  the  local  area  such  as diversions, single runway operations, and emergency airfields. 4.5.6.  After  successfully  completing  all  TI,  the  squadron  commander  may  certify  the  new pilot as MR or BAQ, as applicable..  (Additional sorties and requirements to become MR or BAQ are at the discretion of the squadron commander.) AFI11-2T-1V1  15 JULY 2015   21  4.5.7.  PIT  squadron  commanders  may  tailor  TI  for  previous  MR  IPs  directly  gained  from SUPT  squadrons;  however,  at  a  minimum,  a  local  familiarization  sortie  must  be accomplished.  (T-2). 4.5.8.  Squadron  commanders  may  tailor  TI  for  FPs;  however,  at  a  minimum,  a  local familiarization sortie must be accomplished. (T-2). 4.5.9.  Squadron commanders may waive TI for pilots that remain at the same base in which they completed MQT. (T-2). 4.6.  BIP  Program.  (Note:  PIT,  key  wing  personnel  [wing  commanders,  wing  vice commanders, OG commanders, and OG deputy commanders], and former T-1 pilots with Naval Flight Officer/UCT experience are exempt from this program.) 4.6.1.  Following TI, flight commanders or the chief pilot will assign each new IP to a highly qualified BIP who will monitor the new IP’s performance and provide guidance in all areas of job requirements, until the new IP has instructed through each category of training. (T-2). 4.6.2.  To accommodate different experience levels of new IPs, there are long and short BIP courses.  The  BIP  short  program  is  for  new  IPs  with  previous  instructor  experience  or extensive  MWS  experience.  The  BIP  long  program  expands  on  the  short  program  and  is mandatory for first-assignment IPs and recommended for individuals who have not instructed or  have  limited  MWS  experience.  The  squadron  commander  will  designate  which  program new  IPs  enter  based  on  their  performance  during  IQT,  MQT,  TI,  and  previous  experience. (T-2). 4.6.3.  The  training  prescribed  in  Attachment  5  is  the  minimum  required.  Squadron commanders should tailor each individual’s BIP program and provide additional training, as required. 4.6.4.  Sponsor sorties are logged as training support sorties and may meet CT requirements during the period in which they are flown. 4.7.  Night Flying. 4.7.1.  Night  Definition.  For  purposes  of  T-1A  CT,  night  is  defined  as  that  period  of darkness occurring from the end of evening civil twilight until the beginning of morning civil twilight.  Night  certification  events  and  CT  requirements  may  only  be  credited  under  the constraints of this definition. For purposes of logging “night time” on the AFTO Form 781, Arms Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, see AFI 11-401. 4.7.2.  Night Certification (Pilot only). 4.7.2.1.  Night certification consists of a dedicated training sortie with a night-certified IP or CSIP and spatial disorientation training accomplished in a MAJCOM-approved spatial disorientation  training  device.  Note:  Spatial  disorientation  training  accomplished  in conjunction with the pilot’s most recent physiological training satisfies this requirement. Accomplish  all  night  training  before  the  first  night  student  or  unit  mission  sortie.  The night  certification  sortie  is  a  transition  sortie  emphasizing  spatial  disorientation,  night instruments,  local  area  (transition  out  base),  traffic  pattern  procedures,  and  visual references.  The  night  certification  sortie  includes  the  following  maneuvers:  a  simulated single-engine  pattern  and  landing,  no-flap  pattern  and  landing,  tactical  overhead  pattern and landing, and a circling approach.   22  AFI11-2T-1V1  15 JULY 2015 4.7.2.2.  Pilots  may  log  ID  sorties  in  conjunction  with  the  night  certification  sortie.  See paragraph 4.13.3.1. 4.7.3.  Night  Certification  (CSO  only).  Night  certification  consists  of  accomplishing  an instructor-led night orientation of the aircraft interior lighting system and discussion of night operating procedures, restrictions, and techniques. 4.7.4.  Night Restrictions.  Pilots who are not night certified will not fly at night (as defined by AFI 11-401) without a night-certified and current IP occupying a pilot seat in the aircraft.  Touch-and goes are not accomplished at night with a CSO in the right seat. 4.7.5.  Documentation.  Record night certification on an AF Form 4348 in the training folder and document on the Letter of Xs. (T-2). 4.8.  PWC Certification.  (See AFI 11-2T-1, Volume 3, for PWC operational requirements and information.)  PWC  certification  is  designed  to  reduce  the  exposure  of  pilots  with  limited experience  to  risks  inherent  during  periods  of  low  ceiling  and  visibility.  Before  PWC  1 certification, pilots will demonstrate knowledge and proficiency in a simulator to a current PWC 1  pilot  (flight  commander  or  above).  When  calculating  total  time  for  the  purpose  of  PWC designation,  do  not  include  student,  undergraduate  pilot  training  (UPT),  or  “other”  flight  time. Squadron  commanders  will  certify  pilots  PWC  1  on  an  AF  Form  4348  and  document  on  the Letter of Xs. (T-2). 4.8.1.  PWC  1.  Qualified T-1A pilot designated as “experienced” (see  paragraph  1.2.3.1). (T-2). 4.8.2.  PWC 2.  All other qualified T-1A pilots. (T-2). 4.9.  Uncontrolled (Nontowered) Airfield Certification.  See AFI 11-2T-1, Volume 3. Record the certification in the training folder and document on the Letter of Xs. (T-2). 4.10.  FCF  Certification.  See  paragraph  A3.6  for  FCF  aircrew  requirements.  Record  the certification on an AF Form 4348 in the training folder and document on the Letter of Xs. (T-2). 4.11.  AI Certification (479 FTG only): 4.11.1.  ICSO.  (T-2).  AI  certifies  ICSOs  in  two-ship  (live  and  simulated)  AI  operations  of the  CSO  equipment  in  the  modified  T-1A.  Individuals  entered  in  AI  certification  training must  be  mission  qualified.  AI  certification  for  ICSOs  consists  of  a  minimum  of  ground training  (academics);  one  T25  mission  (A/A  mission);  and  one  T-1A  sortie  (A/A  mission). Note: Training certifies the ability for an ICSO to operate and instruct during AI operations missions in any student or instructor position of modified T-1A aircraft. 4.11.1.1.  A/A  Academics  (Mandatory).  (T-2).  Instructor-led  courses  covering:  AI geometry;  air-to-air  communication;  weapons  employment;  intercept  procedures;  APG-70  function;  APG-70  operation;  T-1A  concept;  T-1A  restrictions;  mission  planning; student  errors  and  solutions;  A/A  TACAN  operation;  pilot/CSO/copilot  intercept  CRM; blue air roles and responsibilities; red air roles and responsibilities; and local procedures. 4.11.1.2.  T25 Simulators.  (T-2). 4.11.1.2.1.  Simulator 1: APG-70 operation and basic intercepts. 4.11.1.3.  T96 Simulators (Two planned, one minimum).  (T-2). AFI11-2T-1V1  15 JULY 2015   23  4.11.1.3.1.  Simulator 1: Mission scenario. 4.11.1.3.2.  Simulator  2:  Student  A/A  mission  scenario.  The  mission  consists  of  the candidate instructing a certified AI ICSO acting in the role of “student.” 4.11.1.4.  Aircraft  Sorties  (Two  planned,  one  minimum).  Note:  Candidate  may occupy  the  copilot  or  CSO  and  jump  or  instructor  seats  for  the  aircraft  sorties.  This enables maximum certification training, to include IPs during dedicated A/A sorties. 4.11.2.  Pilot.  AI  certifies  IPs  in  the  T-1A  AI  mission.  AI  certification  training  is administered by an AI-certified IP occupying the right seat and upgrade or AI-certified ICSO occupying the jump seat/I-1 crew position. An AI-certified or upgrade ICSO directs AIs from the  CSO  console  to  effect  IP  AI  certification  training.  AI  certification  for  IPs  consists  of  a minimum  of  ground  training  (academics),  one  T25  (over-the-  shoulder  A/A  observation mission), and one T-1A flight (A/A mission). 4.11.2.1.  A/A  Academics  (Mandatory).  (T-2).  Instructor-led  courses  covering:  AI geometry;  air-to-air  communication;  weapons  employment;  intercept  procedures;  APG-70  function;  T-1A  concept;  T-1A  restrictions;  mission  planning;  student  errors  and solutions;  A/A  TACAN  operation;  pilot/CSO/copilot  intercept  CRM;  blue  air  roles  and responsibilities; red air roles and responsibilities; and local procedures; etc. 4.11.2.2.  T96 Simulators. 4.11.2.2.1.  Simulator  1:    Basic  intercepts  and  APG-70  function.  The  intent  of  the mission  is  for  pilot  orientation  and  familiarization  of  the  AGP-70  function  and required CSO interaction to  operate the radar. Training does not  require  proficiency in operating the APG-70. 4.11.2.3.  Aircraft Sorties  (Two planned, one minimum).  (T-2). Note: Sortie consists of an A/A-certified IP in the right seat; ICSO in the jump seat; and candidate ICSO and A/A certified ICSO occupying the CSO and instructor seats, in any combination. AIs are accomplished by the candidate or instructor occupying the CSO seat. 4.11.2.3.1.  Sortie 1: Basic or student A/A mission (mandatory). 4.11.2.3.2.  Sortie 2: Basic or student A/A mission. 4.12.  Ground  Training  Requirements.  Ground training accomplished during  IQT, MQT, TI, and  BIP  may  be  credited  toward  CT  requirements  for  the  training  cycle  in  which  it  was accomplished.  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1,  and  Table  4.2  establish  aircrew  ground  training requirements. 4.12.1.  Units  will  ensure  all  aircrew  attend  CRM  training  which  builds  on  the  basic  CRM skills taught in undergraduate and formal training units (FTU). (T-2). This is a calendar year requirement  and  is  tracked  in  ARMS.  Dual-qualified  pilots  will  accomplish  CRM  in  their primary  aircraft.  Briefings  and  debriefings  include  the  core  curriculum  of  CRM  training according to AFI 11-290 and applicable MAJCOM guidance. 4.12.2.  Refer  to  the  ETCA  web  page  at  https://etca.randolph.af.mil/  for  ancillary  ground training requirements.   24  AFI11-2T-1V1  15 JULY 2015 Table 4.2.

Aircrew noncurrent for water survival training are limited to over-water operations to remain within gliding distance of land. 4.13.  Flying Training.  All aircrew will maintain currency requirements as applicable in Table 4.3  and  sortie/event  requirements  shown  in  Table  4.4.  The  OG/FTG  commander  or  equivalent (AETC/A3V  for  MAJCOM  FEs)  is  waiver  authority  for  these  requirements.  (T-2).  Document waivers  in  the  individual’s  training  folder.  All  maneuvers  are  flown  according  to  Air  Force instructions, directives, policies, and flight manuals. 4.13.1.  Restrictions.  Aircrew  will  not  fly  sorties,  events,  mission,  and  currency  items  in which they are not qualified, current, and certified. 4.13.2.  Currency and Recurrency.  Unless otherwise restricted, aircrew may log currencies during any sortie or mission if the maneuver or item is demonstrated. Noncurrent individuals will not perform that sortie, mission, or event except for the purpose of regaining currency. Unless  otherwise  specified,  supervisory  requirements  pertaining  to  recurrency  may  be satisfied  in  the  flight  position  that  offers  best  control  of  the  mission,  as  determined  by  the squadron commander. (T-2). See Table 4.3 for T-1A currency requirements. AFI11-2T-1V1  15 JULY 2015   25  4.13.2.1.  Landing  Currency  (Pilot  only).  Landing  currency  is  required  to  maintain basic aircraft qualification. (T-2). Currency is regained by flying at least three satisfactory landings  with  a  current  IP.

Semiannual  Sortie/Event  Requirements.  Table  4.4  establishes  the  minimum semiannual sortie/event requirements for all MR IPs and ICSOs. FPs and senior officer pilots are required to meet currency requirements prescribed in  Table  4.3 and EP/CRM simulator event requirements of Table 4.4. (T-2).   28  AFI11-2T-1V1  15 JULY 2015 4.13.3.1.  ID Sorties.  All experienced SUPT and PIT IPs will fly a minimum of one ID sortie  dedicated  to  each  syllabus  category  of  training  per  semiannual  period:  transition, navigation, formation, air drop (AD), and air refueling. Inexperienced IPs will fly two ID sorties.  All  UCT  IPs  will  fly  a  minimum  of  one  ID  sortie  dedicated  to  each  syllabus category  of  training  per  semiannual  period:  navigation,  air  operations,  and  AI,  as applicable. ICSOs will fly a minimum of one ID sortie per semiannual period dedicated to  each  syllabus  category  of  training  per  semiannual  period:  navigation,  low-level navigation,  air  operations,  and  AI  (AI-certified  only).  Use  Table  4.5  as  a  guide  to establish  squadron  ID  sortie  profiles.  The  remaining  ID  sorties  may  be  flown  in  any syllabus  category  and  should  be  tailored  to  meet  developmental  requirements,  as determined by the squadron commander as applicable. (T-2). ICSOs qualified in both the I-1  and  I-2  position  must  accomplish  a  minimum  of  one  ID  sorties  in  each  applicable category of training in each position. 4.13.3.1.1.  Logging ID Sorties.  ID sorties are not logged on formal training syllabus missions. (T-2). For purposes of CT, an aircraft sortie is defined from initial takeoff to full-stop landing. Due to differences in average T-1A sortie duration compared to that of other undergraduate MDSs, if aircraft sortie duration exceeds 2.0 hours, each pilot  or CSO may log up to two ID sorties. During dedicated ID sorties, plan for no more (for  example,  AR/AD, transition/formation,  AI/low-level  navigation).  Provided  they  are  not  administering the MQT instruction, ICSOs occupying the Jump or co-pilot seat may log ID sorties with ICSO MQT being conducted in the I-2/S-2 positions and vice versa. two  profiles  on  one  aircraft  sortie than 4.13.3.1.1.1.  UCT IPs. UCT IPs may log low-level navigation and AI ID sorties with  an  ICSO  occupying  the  copilot  seat.  All  other  ID  sorties  are  flown  with another IP. 4.13.3.1.1.2.  I-2 ICSOs. I-2 ICSOs may log I-2 currency from either the I-2 or S-2 seat provided there is a current and qualified I-2 ICSO in the other seat (I-2 or S-2).  I-2  ICSOs  may  log  this  currency  with  ICSO  MQT  or  undergraduate  CSO training occurring in the S-1 seat. 4.13.3.2.  Semiannual Sortie Events.  Events, when accomplished, may be dual logged. For  example,  a  single-engine  precision  approach  may  log  single-engine  precision approach, precision approach, and instrument approach. Currency may also be updated if flown according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1; AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules; and this publication. 4.13.3.2.1.  Events may be logged during formal training syllabus missions when the pilot demonstrates the maneuver. 4.13.3.2.2.  Student  Events.  Log  student  events  based  on  the  number  of  events flown  and  instructor-student  ratio.  Log  one  student  event  for  each  formal  training syllabus  event  flown.  More  than  one  student  event  may  be  logged  for  each  total sortie. Table 4.4.  Minimum T-1A Semiannual Sortie/Event Requirements (T-2).

All BIP sorties  are  flown  with  the  assigned  BIP,  flight  USEMs,  or  supervisors  (assistant  flight commander or  above) in  the new  IP’s  chain  of  command. These flights  further develop the  new  IP’s  flying  proficiency  and  instructional  techniques.  A  minimum  of  one  BIP sortie is flown in any category of training (transition, navigation, AR, AD, or formation). During  the  sortie,  BIPs  will  discuss  instructional  techniques,  planning  profiles,  student progress,  grading  practices,  pitfalls  to  avoid,  local  flying  policies,  and  common  student errors. Document all sorties and debriefings in the new IP’s BIP record. A5.2.2.2.  Sponsor  Sorties.  BIPs,  flight  USEMs,  or  any  supervisor  (assistant  flight commander or above) in the IP’s chain of command will fly sponsor sorties with the IP’s students to ensure effective technique and instruction. (T-2). A5.2.2.2.1.  A minimum of one sponsor sortie is flown (in any  category  of training) after  the  students  have  had  sufficient  exposure  and  influence  to  the  new  IP’s techniques. BIPs may  actively fly with  the new  IP’s students  or observe the new  IP from the jump seat. A5.2.2.2.2.  Document all sorties and debriefings in the new IP’s BIP record. (T-2). A5.3.  BIP  Program  Completion.  After  completion  of  all  ground  and  flying  training requirements, squadron commanders will certify program completion. Place BIP training records in the IP’s training folder. (T-2).    44  AFI11-2T-1V1  15 JULY 2015 Attachment 6 PILOT INSTRUCTOR TRAINING RE-BLUE PROGRAM A6.1.  Re-Blue Program.  The purpose of the Re-Blue Program is to increase the quality of PIT instruction.  This  is  accomplished  by  giving  PIT  IPs  the  opportunity  to  interact  and  fly  with undergraduate flying training (UFT) student pilots in all categories of flying and ground training instruction.  IP  re-bluing  should  be  accomplished  at  the  discretion  of  the  squadron  commander after considering manning, PFT, and other constraints. PIT IPs who have not flown with a T-1A UFT student within 2 years prior to their IP letter should spend a week flying with UFT students between  6  months  to  1 year  of  receiving  their  IP  certification  at  PIT.  Additionally,  all  PIT  IPs should spend a week flying with UFT students after instructing at PIT for 3 years. A6.2.  PIT IP Responsibilities.  PIT IPs: A6.2.1.  Contact  the host squadron point of  contact  to  determine  additional requirements or documentation. A6.2.2.  Are current in all requirements and training events prior to traveling to the UFT host squadron. A6.2.3.  Report to the host squadron DO. A6.2.4.  Sample as many different categories of flying and ground training as possible while at the host squadron. A6.2.5.  Bring  back  AFTO  Form  781  extracts  and  documentation  required  for  logging  CT training at home station. A6.3.  Host Squadron Responsibilities.  Host squadrons: (T-2). A6.3.1.  Utilize the PIT IP to the maximum extent possible after consulting with the PIT IP. The PIT IP should be treated and scheduled like any other “line IP.” Schedule the PIT IP for student sorties over CT sorties to maximize training objectives. A6.3.2.  Schedule  at  least  one  local  familiarization  sortie  to  acquaint  the  PIT  IP  with  local procedures and pattern or area references. A6.3.3.  Attempt to fly the IP with students in all categories and varying proficiency levels so he or she can get an accurate picture of the UFT environment.  AFI11-2T-1V1  15 JULY 2015   45  Attachment 7 BREAK-IN-TRAINING PROGRAM A7.1.  Recent  UFT  T-1A  Graduates.  UFT T-1A graduates who will exceed 30 days between class graduation and follow-on flying training (FTU, PIT) are authorized to fly additional T-1A aircraft training sorties after graduation. The purpose of these sorties is to maintain proficiency, not experience new maneuvers or complete upgrades. A7.2.  FTU/PIT-Bound  Graduates.  At  their  discretion,  FTU/PIT-bound  graduates  may participate  on  a  noninterference  basis  (sorties  will  not  be  generated  solely  for  BIT  purposes). Graduates may fly with an IP or CSIP approximately once a week in a variety of categories, with special  emphasis  on  instrument  training  and  CRM.  Makeup  sorties  are  not  required  due  to unavailability.  Unlimited  aircrew  training  device  sorties  are  authorized  on  a  space  available basis. A7.3.  Graduate Pilots.  Graduate pilots may occupy any seat and should attempt to accomplish one landing per sortie. Graduate CSOs may occupy the jump or S-2 seat.To ensure a safe level of proficiency is maintained, graduates must complete life support/aircrew flight equipment training and boldface testing according to Table 4.2 and local directives. MQF testing is not required. A7.4.  Logging Training.  Log all training according to AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-202, Volume 1. Instructors may log events according to this instruction. A7.5.  Orientation  Sorties.  Wing  commanders  may  authorize  orientation  sorties  for  any graduate in any wing or group aircraft according to AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-401/AETC Sup (for example, a T-1A graduate awaiting T-6 PIT may be authorized orientation sorties in the T-6).
