This  Chapter  provides  guidance  in  planning  and  scheduling  nuclear  airlift missions.    OPSEC  is  essential  at  all  times  and  in  all  mission  correspondence.    Nuclear  airlift mission  success  relies  upon  reliable,  qualified,  and  prepared  aircrews  and  support  personnel during  all  phases  of  a  mission  (from  planning  through  execution).    As  a  critical  function  of reliability, crew morale is essential to enduring nuclear airlift mission success. 2.2.  Planning  and  Scheduling  Criteria.  Nuclear  surety,  national  security,  and  mission compliance  with  Weapon  System  Safety  Rules  (WSSR)  are  the  most  important  considerations when scheduling a mission. 2.2.1.  Aircrews should transport nuclear cargo by the most efficient route while complying with diplomatic clearance requirements.  When possible, minimize unnecessary landings, air refueling and handling of nuclear cargo. 2.2.1.1.  618 AOC (TACC) mission planners and Aircraft Commanders will  refer to the requirements in the DoD FCGictectSpecial Weapons Overflight Guideictect(SWOG). (T-0). 2.2.1.2.  618  AOC  (TACC)  mission  planners  will  ensure  missions  transporting  nuclear cargo  are  planned  to  avoid  heavily  populated  areas  when  practical.  (T-2)    This consideration  should  not  cause  such  an  additive  amount  of  additional  flight  time  to generate additional air refueling events or unnecessary crew requirements. 2.2.2.  Mission planners, squadron/unit Nuclear Airlift Monitor (NAM), aircrew, shipper, and receiver personnel will coordinate on all scheduled operations and sequences of events. (T-2) 2.2.3.  Plan  missions  to  ensure  on-loading  and  off-loading  of  nuclear  cargo,  ground  crew operations,  and  convoy  movement  times  occur  during  daylight  hours.    Exceptions  to  this policy must be approved by the US installation wing commander, or for MUNSS locations, MUNSS  commander  and  host  nation  installation  commander.    The  US  installation  wing commander,  or  for  MUNSS  locations,  MUNSS  commander  and  host  nation  installation commander, must approve any exceptions to this policy. (T-1) 2.2.4.  618  AOC  (TACC)  mission  planners  will  avoid  scheduling  more  than  one  nuclear-laden aircraft to transit the same airfield each day.   More than one mission may be scheduled to the same location in one day if approved by the US installation wing commander, or for MUNSS locations, the MUNSS commander and host nation installation commander. 2.2.5.  618 AOC (TACC) mission planners will ensure all primary and supporting installation agencies  are  coordinated  with  when  determining  Crew  Replacing,  Staging,  and  Swapping sequence of events (SOE) and procedures for a particular mission. (T-2)  See paragraph 2.12 for additional execution guidance. 2.2.6.  Aircrew  scheduling  requirements/limits  directed  in  AFI  11-2C-17,  Vol  3,  C-17 Operations  Procedures,  and  Volume  1  of  this  instruction  apply.    Due  to  the  critical importance  of  safely  transporting  nuclear  cargo,  the  portion  of  any  mission  from  the 12 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 beginning  of  Crew  Duty  Day  (CDD)  until  the  aircrew  is  no  longer  required  per  DoD  S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108, is further restricted as follows: 2.2.6.1.  When  nuclear  cargo  is  airlifted,  the  Aircraft  Commander  will  ensure  all  PNAF duties are accomplished within the PNAF CDD. (T-1)  When PNAF duties are complete or  the  PNAF  CDD  has  expired,  aircrew  may  only  perform  non-nuclear  ground/flight duties within the remaining Crew Duty Time (CDT) IAW AFI 11-2C-17, Vol 3. (T-1) 2.2.6.1.1.  Basic  PNAF  CDD.    Limited  to  16+00  hours  (regardless  of  crew composition). (T-1) 2.2.6.1.2.  Augmented PNAF CDD.  Limited to 20+00 hours for missions scheduled for aerial refueling (A/R) or a C17 mission using the extended range tank in lieu of an A/R. (T-1)  If  a scheduled A/R is  canceled  after  crew  alert  and the crew  was alerted for a 20-hour crew duty day, Aircraft Commanders will ensure the PNAF CDD does not exceed 20+00 hours. (T-2) 2.2.6.1.3.  In order to  remain within prescribed crew-duty day limitations, 618 AOC (TACC)  mission  planners  should  consider  increasing  aircraft  performance  speeds (within allowable limits) to minimize the need for duty-day waivers. 2.2.6.2.  Basic  and  Augmented  PNAF  CDDs  include  ground  time  for  loading  and offloading  of  nuclear  cargo  and  terminates  when  the  aircrew  is  no  longer  required  per DoD  S-5210.41-M_AFMAN  31-108.  (T-1)    Additionally,  the  Aircraft  Commander  will develop a work-rest plan to mitigate Operational Risk Management (ORM) factors. (T-1) 2.2.6.3.  The  18  AF/CC  is  the  waiver  authority  for  PNAF  scheduling  requirements  and CDD  limits  associated  with  this  instruction.    The  18  AF/CC  may  issue  a  CONOPS  to waive standing or known mission execution requirements.  Waivers may be requested by either the operating wing or the 618 AOC (TACC). 2.2.6.4.  618  AOC  (TACC)  mission  planners  and  Aircraft  Commanders  will  ensure adequate ground time is available for proper crew rest prior to executing a nuclear airlift mission segment. (T-1) 2.2.6.4.1.  Before  home  station  departure  or  crew  replacement,  stage,  or  swap,  618 AOC  (TACC)  mission  planners  and  Aircraft  Commanders  will  ensure  crew  duty periods  do  not  exceed  16+00  hours  unless  crews  are  afforded  a  minimum  of  24+00 hours ground time prior to alerting for a nuclear airlift mission. (T-1) 2.2.6.4.2.  During non-nuclear PNAF mission segments (no nuclear or nuclear-related cargo transported, on loaded, or offloaded), 618 AOC (TACC) mission planners will ensure the CDT is  planned  IAW AFI 11-2C-17,  Vol 3 requirements. (T-2)  Aircraft Commanders  will  ensure  these  segments  are  not  planned  to  exceed  a  basic  16+00 hour CDD unless ground time at the nuclear loading location is at least 24+00 hours prior to executing a nuclear PNAF mission segment. (T-2) 2.2.6.5.  Ground  Operations.    Required  ground  operations  vary  greatly  depending  upon the cargo type, quantity, and overall complexity  of the operation.  Therefore, 618 AOC (TACC) mission planners will develop the mission itinerary with detailed input from the operating squadron/unit prior to publishing the Mission Setup Message. (T-2) AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 13 2.2.6.5.1.  Remain  Over  Night  (RON).   Aircrew  fatigue  and  morale  have immeasurable impacts on nuclear surety.  Crew rest locations should be selected not only for mission requirements, but also to provide a suitable atmosphere for crew rest. 2.2.6.5.2.  To ensure crew and installation support personnel are focused solely on the offload  operation,  PNAF  missions  should  normally  be  scheduled  to  crew  rest  at  the conclusion  of  a  nuclear  airlift  segment.    Note:    If  custodial  installation  aircraft support  is  inadequate  for  RON  conditions  between  offload  and  onload  operations,  a repositioning leg is authorized to a suitable installation. 2.2.6.5.2.1.  Normal ground time between arrival and departure is 17+15 hours.  If both an offload upon arrival and onload prior to departure are scheduled, ground time should be a minimum of 20+15 hours.  618 AOC (TACC) mission planners may  adjust  ground  time  to  satisfy  known  mission  requirements;  however, minimum ground time will not be less than 16+30 hours. (T-1) 2.2.6.5.2.2.  618  AOC  (TACC)  mission  planners  will  ensure  PNAF  missions carrying  nuclear  cargo  are  not  scheduled  to  RON  at  en  route  locations.  (T-1)  With  the  exception  of  emergency  divert  situations,  618  AOC  (TACC)  mission planners and Aircraft Commanders will ensure nuclear laden aircraft only RON at installations with adequate support. (T-1) 2.2.6.5.2.3.  USAFE/A3/10  approval  is  required  to  RON  with  nuclear  cargo aboard (Hot RON) in the USAFE Area of Responsibility (AOR). 2.2.6.5.2.4.  Refer to the DoD FCG SWOG for additional RON guidance. 2.2.6.5.3.  En  route  Stop  (Non-RON).    Normal  ground  time  for  loading  and offloading  is  3+15  hours.    Planners  will  adjust  this  time  based  on  the  type  and quantity  of  cargo  being  transported,  ground  support  available,  and  anticipated complexity of on/offload procedures. (T-2)  Do not increase ground or flight times to avoid delays or decrease times to remain within PNAF CDD constraints. 2.2.6.6.  Pre/Depositioning Mission Segments. 2.2.6.6.1.  PNAF missions will not be planned to flow from or into another equal or higher priority mission without approval of the 18 AF/CC. (T-2)  During planning or execution, 618 AOC/TACC coordination with the operating OG/CC is required for all other mission changes on pre/depositioning segments (e.g. assigning aircrew/aircraft for a follow-on mission). (T-2) 2.2.6.6.2.  Due to stringent maintenance preparation requirements for mission aircraft, 618 AOC/TACC will only schedule the minimum number of legs required to position an aircraft to the first onload location. (T-2)  If a prepositioning stop is required, 618 AOC  (TACC)  mission  planners  will  ensure  the  en  route  location  is  capable  of providing the necessary support requirements. (T-2) 2.2.6.6.3.  PNAF  missions  will  be  scheduled  to  crew  rest  at  the  conclusion  of  a nuclear  airlift  mission  prior  to  returning  to  home  station  or  other  follow  on  non-nuclear mission tasking. (T-2)  The PNAF Aircraft Commander may request a quick-turn or an early return to home station through normal channels. 14 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 2.2.6.6.4.  On  depositioning  legs  without  nuclear  or  nuclear-related  cargo,  the operating  airlift  wing  may  return  the  aircraft  and  crew  to  home  station  on  training time.    If  the  operating  wing  elects  to  operate  on  training  time,  the  Aircraft Commander will coordinate their intentions with 618 AOC (TACC)/XOC prior to the depositioning  leg.  (T-2)    Once  notified  of  the  requested  training,  618  AOC (TACC)/XOOOD planners will facilitate the aircrew mission request; changes to the Mission  Setup  Message  are  not  required.  (T-2)    When  requested  by  the  operating wing,  training  time  should  be  planned  into  Mission  Setup  Message  prior  to  mission launch from home station to minimize coordination efforts during the nuclear airlift-tasked portion of the mission. 2.2.7.  Schedulers, planners, and operating aircrew must also consider the following: 2.2.7.1.  DoD  Foreign  Clearance  Guide  (FCG),  at  https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil  or http://www.fcg.pentagon.smil.mil, which also includes a Classified Supplement. (T-0) 2.2.7.2.  Host military command restrictions. (T-0) 2.2.7.3.  Airfield restrictions, operating hours, Prior Permission Required (PPR), etc. (T-2) 2.2.7.4.  User capability (hours of operation, security, etc.). 2.2.7.5.  DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108. (T-0) 2.2.7.6.  Deconflict  mission  itinerary  with  non-support  messages  IAW  AFI  21-203, Nuclear Accountability Procedures. (T-2) 2.2.7.7.  Planning  considerations  found  in  DoDI  4540.05,  DoD  Transportation  of  US Nuclear Weapons. (T-0) 2.3.  Air Refueling (A/R). 2.3.1.  A/R should be planned to reduce  ground  exposure of nuclear cargo at  bases without established  authorized  weapons  storage  areas  (WSA)  and  to  avoid  the  increased  safety  and security  risks  inherent  in  additional  approaches,  landings,  takeoffs,  and  departures.    Plan these  missions  to  be  accomplished  non-stop  between  onload  and  offload  installations.  618 AOC (TACC) mission planners will ensure PNAF missions are only planned to conduct A/R in  order  to  arrive  at  intended  destinations  and  suitable  alternates  with  required  contingency fuel. (T-1). 2.3.2.  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOOOD  mission  planners  will  coordinate  with  618  AOC (TACC)/XOOKS  for  tanker  support.  (T-2)    618  AOC  (TACC)/XOPSA  will  coordinate altitude  reservations  with  the  appropriate  altitude  reservation  facility.  (T-2)    Plan  a  backup 24(cid:173)hour slip in tanker support and altitude reservations, if applicable. 2.3.2.1.  Mission  planners  will  include  the  following  information  in  the  tanker  request and A/R supplement: 2.3.2.1.1.  Airborne or manned ground spares for each primary tanker. (T-2) 2.3.2.1.1.1.  618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD mission planners will determine the best course of action to satisfy requirements for each mission segment. (T-2)  Mission planners  will  coordinate  the  information  with  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOOKS  for AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 15 planning. (T-2) 2.3.2.1.1.2.  A/R  planners  should  coordinate  spare  tankers  at  a  separate  location outside  the  primary's  weather  pattern.    618  AOC  (TACC)/DDO3  will  ensure notifications,  restrictions,  and  requirements  are  passed  to  the  operating  tanker wing(s). (T-2) 2.3.2.1.1.3.  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOOOD  mission  planners  will  provide  the operating tanker crew a briefing concerning mission OPSEC, SWOG routing, and other relevant restrictions via secure means. (T-1) 2.3.2.1.1.4.  To  minimize  en  route  times  and  CDD,  use  single  primary  and alternate tankers for each planned A/R to the maximum extent possible.  Mission planners  and  tanker  units  will  only  split  the  planned  offload  of  fuel  across multiple  tankers  if  a  single  tanker  is  incapable  of  providing  the  total planned/required offload. (T-2) 2.3.2.1.1.5.  A  single  KC(cid:173)10  tanker  may  backup  two  KC-135  tankers  if  the offload  is  sufficient  and  does  not  exceed  A/R  performance  charts.    A  different refueling  altitude  and  routing  along  the  altitude  reservation  (ALTRV)  or  A/R track may need to be coordinated and approved before substituting a KC-135 with a KC-10. 2.3.2.1.2.  SWOG restrictions apply to the tanker(s) when refueling. 2.3.3.  To  prepare  for  the  unlikely  event  of  an  unsuccessful  A/R,  PNAF  support  bases  and pre-coordinated  emergency  divert  locations  identified  in  the  Mission  Setup  Message  will stand by to support emergency diverts until released by 618 AOC (TACC)/XOC. (T-2) 2.3.3.1.  Mission  planners  will  ensure  the  pre-coordinated  emergency  divert  location  is prepared  to  receive  a  nuclear-laden  aircraft  in  the  event  of  an  emergency  divert.  (T-2) Wing commanders at these designated bases will ensure the capability to provide security for potential emergency diverts of nuclear-laden aircraft IAW the Mission Setup Message and  DoD  S-5210.41-M_AFMAN  31-108.  (T-0)    Should  the  A/R  be  aborted,  618  AOC (TACC)  will  notify  the  pre-coordinated  emergency  divert  location  and  confirm  host nation notification/coordination. (T-1) 2.3.3.2.  618  AOC  (TACC)    should  not  attempt  to  contact  the  aircrew  in  flight  to determine the successful completion of an A/R event.  However, 618 AOC (TACC)/XOC may contact the aircrew if successful A/R confirmation is not received after 15 minutes past  the  planned  end  of  A/R  time.    After  the  A/R  is  successfully  completed,  618  AOC (TACC)/XOOOD  planners  or  XOCG  will  notify  the  appropriate  pre-coordinated emergency  divert  location  to  release  ground  support  personnel.  (T-2)    In  all  instances, 618 AOC (TACC)/XOC will contact the aircrew immediately in order to transmit high-priority messages or emergency orders. (T-2) 2.3.4.  The Aircraft Commander will cancel a planned A/R event at the earliest opportunity if he/she  determines  it  is  not  required  for  mission  accomplishment.  (T-1)    The  Aircraft Commander’s decision is final. 2.3.5.  A/R over open ocean areas at least 12 nautical miles (NM) off shore. (T-0) 16 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 2.3.5.1.  Aircraft  Commanders  will  accomplish  air  refueling  events  as  safely  and efficiently as possible. (T-1) 2.3.5.1.1.  Aircraft  Commanders  will  only  accomplish  those  maneuvers  required  for transferring the mission required fuel. (T-1)  Example:  Receiving the required onload from the primary tanker only.  Additional events during A/R beyond those necessary to  onload  required  fuel,  including  training  by  tanker  and/or  receiver  crews,  are prohibited at all times. 2.3.5.1.2.  Aircraft  Commanders  will  not  conduct  A/R  upgrade  training  on  missions carrying nuclear cargo (T-1) 2.3.5.1.3.  If  the  designated  PNAF  Aircraft  Commander  is  a  current  Instructor  or Evaluator, they may refuel from either seat, regardless of who is occupying the other seat. 2.3.5.2.  Current  and  qualified  PNAF  Aircraft  Commander  certified  pilots  may  perform air  refueling  on  nuclear  cargo-laden  missions,  provided  the  designated  PNAF  Mission Aircraft Commander is occupying the other seat. (T-1) 2.3.5.3.  PNAF  Aircraft  Commander  upgrade  candidates  (C-17A  Instructor  Pilot  or higher) entered in the formal PNAF Aircraft Commander training program may air refuel nuclear-laden aircraft provided the designated PNAF Mission Aircraft Commander is an Instructor Pilot or higher and is occupying the other seat. (T-1) 2.3.6.  The  Aircraft  Commander  will  provide  the  post-A/R  report  to  the  controlling  C2  cell via appropriate means within 15 minutes after completing an A/R. (T-2) 2.3.7.  To minimize crew fatigue and negative nuclear surety implications, aircrews will only accomplish one offload of nuclear cargo after an A/R segment. (T-1) 2.4.  Mission Planning/Coordination. 2.4.1.

(T-1) 2.5.4.2.4.  PNAF Courier Officer Listing 2.5.4.3.  Information  may  be  added  or  modified  as  long  as  messages  are  in  standard format (Attachment 3). 2.5.5.  Distribution of Mission Setup Message 2.5.5.1.  618  AOC  (TACC)  mission  planners  will  ensure  Mission  Setup  Messages  are distributed to the operating unit, all stations (including pre-coordinated emergency divert itinerary,  Command  and  Control  entities, locations) identified  on the  mission 18 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 participating  MAJCOMs  and  combatant  commands,  Air  Force,  Joint  Staff,  and  the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). (T-2) 2.5.5.2.  Requests to receive Mission Setup Messages will be directed to HQ AMC/A3N. 2.5.5.2.1.  HQ AMC/A3N will forward approved requests to 618 AOC/XOOOD with the correct SIPR organizational and/or individual email addresses. 2.5.5.2.2.  Organizations  or  individuals  approved  for  receipt  of  the  Mission  Setup Message will annually validate approval by the end of each fiscal year (FYXX) with the applicable MAJCOM. (T-2) 2.5.6.  Mission  Setup  Message  (Station  Support  Requirements  Acknowledgement  and  24-Hour Confirmation): 2.5.6.1.  All  stations  listed  on  the  mission  itinerary  will  send  an  acknowledgement  of ability  to  support/non-support  the  mission  itinerary  and/or  the  applicable  special requirements listed in Part II of the Mission Setup Message. (T-2) 2.5.6.1.1.  The  Acknowledgement  of  Station  Support  Requirements  message  will follow a standard format.  (AF Form 527D) (T-2) 2.5.6.1.2.  Paragraph  7  of  the  Mission  Setup  Message  will  indicate  when  an acknowledgement message must be transmitted or received by mission planners, the operational  unit, and 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG-DDO2.  618 AOC (TACC) mission planners  will  provide  three  working  days  for  stations  to  acknowledge  receipt  of  an original Mission Setup Message. (T-2) 2.5.6.1.3.  A  station  only  needs  to  send  acknowledgement  for  the  most  current Mission Setup Message, i.e., when a change to a Mission Setup Message is released before a station has sent the acknowledgement for the previous message. 2.5.6.2.  All en route stations will send a 24-Hour Confirmation of Support Requirements message, along with pre-coordinated emergency divert locations as listed in the mission itinerary.  (T-2)    A  station  with  multiple  itinerary  entries  on  the  same  day  may  be combined  on  one  24-Hour  message.    A  station  with  a  single  entry  spanning  two consecutive days and no additional entries on the second day need only send one 24-Hour message. 2.5.6.2.1.  The 24-Hour Confirmation of Support Requirements message will follow a standard format.  (AF Form 527E)  (T-2) 2.5.6.2.2.  Mission  planners  will  ensure  the  24-Hour  Confirmation  of  Support Requirements  message  is  transmitted  to  the  operational  unit  and  618  AOC (TACC)/XOCG-DDO2 no later than 24-hours prior to station arrival. (T-2)  Mission planners will  ensure receipt of the confirmation message during an official duty day if the 24-hour period falls on a non-duty day. (T-2)  618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG-DDO2 will make a final voice confirmation of support with the 24-Hour POC identified on the acknowledgement and confirmation messages. (T-2) 2.5.6.2.3.  A  station  is  only  required  to  send  a  24-Hour  Confirmation  of  Support message for the most current Mission Setup Message.  (T-2)  For example, a Mission AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 19 Setup Message change is released before a station has sent the 24-Hour Confirmation for the previous message. 2.6.  Changes to Mission Setup Message. 2.6.1.  Changes  to  Mission  Setup  Messages  should  be  kept  to  a  minimum.    If  changes  are absolutely necessary, the following guidance applies: 2.6.1.1.  618  AOC  (TACC)  mission  planners  will  coordinate  and  distribute  all  changes IAW paragraph 2.5.5. and acknowledged IAW para 2.5.6. (T-2) 2.6.1.2.  618  AOC  (TACC)  mission  planners  will  use  separate  messages  for  each message change. (T-2)  Planners should include a clear statement advising the reason for the change and clearly identify information that is altered from the previous message. (T-2) 2.6.1.3.  618  AOC  (TACC)  mission  planners  will  ensure  message  changes  are  not generated  solely  to  correct  non-critical  typographical  errors.  (T-2)    Write-in  changes  to Mission Setup Messages are not permitted. 2.6.2.  Requesting Changes to the Mission Setup Message. 2.6.2.1.  Wing Commanders will submit Mission Setup Message change requests to 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD for coordination. (T-2) 2.6.2.2.  Stations will send a request for change to the Mission Setup Message submitting a non-support acknowledgement message.  (T-2) 2.6.2.3.  618  AOC  (TACC)  mission  planners  will  not  accept  requests  to  adjust  the mission itinerary by greater than 2 hours within 10 days of mission execution. (T-2) 2.6.2.4.  Missions  enter  the  execution  phase  24-hours  prior  to  scheduled  home  station departure.  Missions  are  considered  complete  after  the  last  active  leg  of  the  mission itinerary.    618  AOC  (TACC)  mission  planners  will  automatically  issue  changes  to  the Mission Setup Message for the following conditions: 2.6.2.4.1.  Mission  is  delayed  more  than  2  hours  by  maintenance,  weather,  or  other factors.  (T-2) 2.6.2.4.2.  Change  to  cargo  information  that  does  not  impact  the  itinerary  or  timing beyond 2 hours. (T-2) 2.6.2.4.3.  Aircraft Divert (T-2) 2.6.2.4.4.  618 AOC (TACC) mission planners will not issue Mission Setup Message changes solely to cancel an A/R. (T-2) 2.6.3.  Waiver  authority  is  618  AOC  (TACC)/CC.    Note:  618  AOC  (TACC)/CC  will  deny waiver requests that do not contain the following information: 2.6.3.1.  Name, grade, unit and title of requester. (T-2) 2.6.3.2.  Date of request. (T-2) 2.6.3.3.  Mission number of affected mission. (T-2) 2.6.3.4.  Detailed reason the change is necessary. (T-2) 20 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 2.6.3.5.  Date and time the required change was discovered. (T-2) 2.6.4.  When changes to the itinerary are necessary after a mission is in execution, 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG-DDO2 will coordinate with 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD mission planners to publish  changes  to  the  Mission  Setup  Message  and  forward  to  the  aircrew  with  an information copy to the operating wing. (T-2)  To avoid mission delays, voice confirmation of  changes  between  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOCG-DDO2  and  the  aircrew  are  acceptable,  but should be used as a last resort.  Mission planners will transmit changes to the Mission Setup Message to all stations and the operating wing using the format provided in  Attachment 3. (T-2) 2.7.  Additional Airlift Requirements. 2.7.1.  If  changes  to  nuclear/nuclear-related  cargo  are  approved  before  a  mission  is  in execution,  mission  planners  will  coordinate  changes  to  the  Mission  Setup  Message  IAW procedures outlined in paragraph 2.6. (T-2) 2.7.2.  Attachment  2  identifies  handling  requirements  for  various  types  of  nuclear  and nuclear-related  materials.    The  Service  Logistic  Agent  (SLA)  will  schedule  nuclear  and nuclear-related  cargo  missions  via  the  Nuclear  Ordnance  Shipping  Schedule  (NOSS).    618 AOC  (TACC)/XOOOD  and  AFGSC/A4  Det  5,  NCP  will  coordinate  any  changes  to  the SAAM  Airlift  Request.  (T-2)    618  AOC  (TACC)/XOOOD  and  the  SLA  will  accomplish coordination as soon as additional cargo is identified. (T-2) 2.7.3.  Only nuclear cargo identified in the Mission Setup Message and Airlift Request may be accepted by the Courier.  (T-1) 2.7.3.1.  If  a  discrepancy  is  identified  between  the  nuclear  cargo,  the  Mission  Setup Message,  or  the  Airlift  Request,  contact  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOOOD  planners  via  the Consolidated  Control  Center  (CCC).    618  AOC  (TACC)  will  immediately  contact  the SLA to resolve any discrepancies. (T-2)  The SLA will review all mission documentation and  identify  to  618  AOC  (TACC)  acceptable  actions  (i.e.    transposed  serial  number, wrong line number, etc.)  The SLA will determine if the nuclear cargo should be accepted by AMC Courier or remain at the shipping unit and transported on a future mission.  The Courier retains the ultimate authority to accept or deny nuclear cargo. 2.7.3.2.  The SLA and 618 AOC (TACC) will issue an updated Airlift Request and new Mission Setup Message if the discrepancy is resolved and the decision is made to proceed with  nuclear  cargo  transport.  (T-2)    The  aircrew  will  not  depart  without a  hard  copy  of the modified Airlift Request and Mission Setup Message. (T-2) 2.7.3.3.  If  a  discrepancy location,  affected Commanders and the Courier will resolve the issue prior to offloading nuclear cargo. (T-2)    All  involved  personnel  should  strongly  consider  security  and  excessive  exposure  of nuclear cargo when resolving discrepancies at an offload location. the  arrival/offload is identified  at 2.7.4.  Cargo: 2.7.4.1.  Opportune cargo may be transported on unsanitized positioning legs.  However, the planned route of flight should not be adjusted solely to accommodate the movement of opportune cargo. AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 21 2.7.4.2.  Nuclear  cargo  can  only  be  scheduled  and  airlifted  if  a  corresponding  loading procedure  is  published  in  T.O.  1C-17A-16-1,  Loading  and  Air  Transport  of  Nuclear Weapon  Cargo.    Accident/incident  response  or  emergency  nuclear  airlift  operations (ENAO) may require the use of non-standard procedures to load nuclear cargo; however, appropriate  Technical  Order  procedures  will  be  used  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.  The 18 AF/CC is not authorized to waive this requirement for PNAF operations. (T-0) 2.7.4.3.  Unused space aboard nuclear cargo missions may be used for opportune cargo if: 2.7.4.3.1.  The user approves the transportation of general cargo. 2.7.4.3.2.  The opportune cargo does not generate additional landings. 2.7.4.3.3.  The  added  weight  will  not  adversely  affect  fuel  requirements,  aircraft center of gravity (CG), loading operations, etc. 2.7.4.3.4.  The cargo is  compatible with  nuclear  or nuclear-related cargo.  618 AOC (TACC)  mission  planners  and  aircrew  will  use  the  hazardous  material  compatibility chart  available  in  AFMAN  24-204  (I),  Preparing  Hazardous  Materials  for  Military Air  Shipments,  to  determine  compatibility  requirements  of  nuclear  cargo,  major assemblies, and nuclear components with other explosive and hazardous materials. 2.7.4.3.5.  The cargo’s dimensions will not cause additional handling or movement of nuclear  cargo.    The  Aircraft  Commander  will  ensure  nuclear-related  and  opportune cargo are loaded in a manner that preserves the ability to jettison nuclear cargo. (T-1)  Note:  Time  permitting,  aircrews  should  jettison  general  cargo  and  unclassified nuclear-related  cargo  (in  order  of  precedence)  before  jettisoning  classified  nuclear-related cargo. 2.7.4.3.6.  The  cargo  will  not  generate  additional  security  measures  associated  with aerial port onload and offload operations. 2.7.4.3.7.  The cargo is  thoroughly searched  and  sanitized before loading  aboard the aircraft. 2.7.4.3.8.  The cargo is properly stored in a secure manner following sanitization . 2.7.4.4.  Aircraft  Commanders  will  ensure  foreign  nationals  (non-US  persons/citizens) are not utilized to load or offload nuclear or nuclear-related cargo. (T-0) 2.7.4.5.  Aircraft  Commanders  will  ensure  foreign  nationals  are  not  utilized  to  load  or offload general cargo when nuclear and/or nuclear-related cargo is present. (T-0) 2.8.  Passengers, Mission Essential Personnel, and Flying Crew Chief. 2.8.1.  Passengers: 2.8.1.1.  Once  the  aircraft  is  sanitized,  Aircraft  Commanders  will  ensure  passengers  are not  transported  until  all  nuclear  cargo  legs  are  complete  or  aircraft  sanitization  is  no longer required. (T-0)  After the last nuclear cargo sortie, passengers may be transported on  any  mission  segment  in  which  the  aircraft  is  empty  or  only  carrying  general  or unclassified nuclear-related cargo. 2.8.1.2.  When  nuclear  and/or  classified  nuclear-related  cargo  is  aboard,  only  the following passengers may be carried as necessary to accomplish the PNAF mission: 22 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 2.8.1.2.1.  Couriers,  shipper  escorts,  permissive  action  link  (PAL)  teams,  authorized inspectors, flying crew chiefs, and security forces personnel authorized in the Airlift Request  or  by  separate  message.    Responsible  commanders  of  identified  personnel will ensure personnel lists are provided to the operating wing a minimum of ten days prior to home station departure. (T-2) 2.8.2.  Mission Essential Personnel (MEP): 2.8.2.1.  MEPs  must  meet  the  basic  requirements  outlined  in  AFI  11-2C-17V3,  C17 Operations  Procedures,  AMCI 11208,  Tanker/Airlift  Operations,  and  AFI  11-401, Aviation  Management.    (T-2)    Commanders  at  all  levels  will  minimize  extraneous personnel on nuclear missions and inside nuclear mission exclusion areas. (T-2) 2.8.2.1.1.  Individuals  requesting  MEP  authorization  will  provide  the  approving authority,  their  Social  Security  Number  (SSN),  security  clearance,  Personnel Reliability  Assurance  Program  (PRP)  status,  specific  mission  for  which  MEP  is requested, and reason for participating in the mission. (T-2)  Commanders will notify the  operating  wing  a  minimum  of  ten  days  prior  to  mission  execution  identifying MEP’s  that  require  escort  by  the  PNAF  crew.  (T-2)    This  provision  ensures  escort officials  are  properly  added  to  the  aircrew  composition  and  are  prepared  to  execute their duties IAW the mission plan.  MEPs should be kept to a minimum. 2.8.2.1.2.  Commanders  will  ensure  MEP  procedures  and  approval  is  IAW  AFI  11-401,  Aviation  Management.  (T-2)    Commanders  will  ensure  MEP  authority  is  not used  as  blanket  approval  on  all  nuclear  airlift  missions  nor  does  it  constitute personnel travel clearance required by the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG). (T-2)    AMC/A3  will  approve  inspector  and  observer  lists  after  prior  coordination  with AMC/A3N.   Inspector/Observer lists may  remain valid for a maximum  of one  year.  Commanders  will  ensure  Inspector/Observer  lists  are  renewed  annually  or  when personnel changes dictate. (T-2) 2.8.2.1.3.  Classify requests appropriately if a specific mission or location is included.  Approve  requests  for  MEP  based  on  security  clearance,  need-to-know,  space available on the aircraft, and valid in-flight or ground duty to perform. 2.8.2.1.4.  Commanders  will  ensure  individuals  requesting  MEP  authorization  to observe  onload  and  offload  operations  without  a  specific  in-flight  duty  are  not approved if any other transportation is available. (T-2) 2.8.2.1.5.  Commanders  of  tasked  operating  wings  and  NAFs  may  authorize  MEP status  for people under their command.  Commanders will ensure MEP status of all other individuals is authorized and approved by AMC/A3. (T-2) 2.8.2.1.6.  Commanders  will  ensure  AMC/A3  validated  MEP  letters  are  transmitted via message from AMC/A3N, and approved by the owning PNAF Operations Group Commander. (T-2) 2.8.2.2.  The PNAF Operations Group Commander is the final authority of MEP status on nuclear  airlift  missions  operated  by  their  wing  IAW  AFI  11-401.    MEPs  must  be  on official orders, and fall into one of the following categories: AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 23 2.8.2.2.1.  Commanders,  supervisors  of  PNAF  aircrews  and  related  programs:    Vice commanders,  operations  group  commanders,  deputy  operations  group  commanders, and PNAF squadron/unit commanders and operations officers. (T-2) 2.8.2.2.2.  PNAF certified aircrew  flight examiners from  the operating PNAF parent wing or MAJCOM. (T-2) 2.8.2.2.3.  Chiefs  of  Safety  and  Nuclear  Surety  Managers  (NSM)  from  the  parent wing and MAJCOM performing Nuclear Surety Staff Assistance Visits (NSSAV) or augmenting Functional Expert Visits (FEV). (T-2) 2.8.2.2.4.  AMC  nuclear  operations  staff  personnel  performing  FEVs,  augmenting NSSAVs, or escorting authorized DVs.  Crewmembers  and  guests  are either part of the crew or on MEP status, but not both for any given mission day. (T-2) 2.8.2.2.5.  MAJCOM  inspector  general,  Air  Force  Inspection  Agency  (AFIA),  Air Force  Safety  Center  (AFSEC),  DTRA,  US  Strategic  Command  (USSTRATCOM), and  AMC  Nuclear  Surety  office inspectors  and  augmentees  conducting inspections/observations.    Note:    AFIA,  AMC/IG,  DTRA,  USSTRATCOM,  and AMC/SEW  offices  are  responsible  for  distributing  and  maintaining  current authorization  letters.    When  changes  occur,  updated  letters  will  be  signed  and digitally  distributed  to:    AMC/A3N,  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOOOD,  618  AOC (TACC)/XOCG and 4 AS/DOOMS. (T-2) 2.8.2.3.  MEP authorizations (individual orders or MAJCOM/NAF message) will include the following information: approval authority, security clearance, SSN, mission number, and reason for participating on the mission.  Transmit  classified mission information  or MEP coordination via secure means (i.e. SIPRNet, Secure Fax, STE, VOSIP, etc.). (T-2) 2.8.2.4.  The  operating  squadron/unit  will  brief  persons  traveling  as  MEP  (Aircraft Commanders will brief MEPs when joining the mission en route).  Briefing items should include  but  are  not  limited  to  mission  specific  information  required  to  accomplish  the assigned  task.    Commanders  will  ensure  briefings  cover  applicable  safety  and  security standards  as  well  as  emergency  procedures.

The  Courier  will  ensure  MEPs  are  positively  identified  by  a  service  or  agency official identification card. (T-2) 2.8.2.6.  The  Courier  must  verify  the  MEP’s  PRP  status  prior  to  executing  the  tasked mission.  (T-2)    Certified  individuals  must  have  an  appropriate  annotation  in  their  MEP authorization.  (T-2)    A  valid  Two-Person  Concept  (TPC)  team  must  escort  individuals not certified under PRP. (T-2) 2.8.2.7.  Commanders will ensure MEP travel orders identify the MEP approval authority and are presented to the aircrew before mission execution. (T-2) 2.8.2.8.  MEP authority provides direct access to the mission aircraft without processing through passenger service section; therefore, the aircrew is responsible for manifest and anti-hijacking  procedures for MEPs.  The  Loadmaster will annotate  all MEPs not  listed on  the  AF  Form  4327A,  Crew  Flight  Authorization,  on  a  DD  Form  2131,  Passenger Manifest. (T-2) 24 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 2.8.2.9.  MEPs  on  PRP  status  and  designated  by  the  Courier  may  be  authorized unescorted entry into the restricted area around the aircraft.   MEPs certified under PRP and knowledgeable in the task to be performed may be used as part of a two-person team. 2.8.2.10.  MEP  verification.    Aircraft  Commanders  will  not  allow  anyone  to  fly  on  a nuclear mission unless they are convinced of the person's identity and the legality of their authorization. (T-1) 2.8.2.10.1.  If  there  is  any  doubt  or  suspicion,  regardless  of  rank  or  position, diplomatically but firmly deny access to the aircraft and cargo. 2.8.2.10.2.  Unless  personally  known,  do  not  accept  a  single  set  of  orders  as  MEP authorization.    Confirm  orders  through  appropriate  channels.    For  example, MAJCOM  IG,  AFIA,  AFSEC,  DTRA,  and  AMC  Nuclear  Surety  inspectors  are identified on  a Master  Inspector  List/Letter included in  the Nuclear Mission  Kit.    If required,  the  Aircraft  Commander  will  contact  outside  agencies  to  assist  in  MEP verification. (T-2) 2.8.3.  Flying  Crew  Chiefs  (FCC).    Flying  crew  chiefs  are  not  normally  required  on  PNAF missions.  FCCs will be scheduled on nuclear missions at  the discretion of the PNAF wing commander (if required). (T-2) 2.8.3.1.  FCCs  need  not  be  PRP-certified,  but  must  possess  a  minimum  final  Secret security  clearance.  (T-2)    Ensure  PRP  status  is  noted  on  the  aircrew  entry  authority  list (EAL). 2.8.3.2.  FCCs  will  attend  the  squadron/unit's  nuclear  mission  briefing.  (T-2)    The Nuclear  Airlift  Monitor  or  designated  representative  will  individually  brief  the  FCC before attending the nuclear mission briefing.

(T-2)  Do not  provide  FCCs  sole  custody  of  the  Nuclear  Mission  Kit  or  aircrew  side-arms.  Exception:    When  aircraft  servicing  and  maintenance  is  required,  FCCs  may  seal unsanitized and empty nuclear mission aircraft.  The Aircraft Commander will ensure the mission aircraft is re-sanitized before subsequent loading of nuclear cargo. (T-2) 2.9.  PNAF Structure. 2.9.1.  The PNAF is composed of specially selected and trained aircrews assigned to PNAF-certified  wings  that  have  successfully  completed  an  initial  nuclear  surety  inspection  with  a “Ready”  rating,  and  continue  to  meet  recurring  inspection  and  training  requirements associated with nuclear surety standards. 2.9.2.  PNAF-certified  wings  will  maintain  a  prescribed  number  of  qualified  aircrews  as determined by their respective MAJCOM. (T-1) In addition to CJCSI reporting requirements, the PNAF Wing Commander will notify the 18 AF/CC, AMC/A3R and AMC/A3N when the PNAF  crew  force  falls  below  the  wing’s  Designed  Operational  Capability  (DOC)  required AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 25 levels.  (T-2)    Attached  crewmembers  may  be  PNAF-qualified  and  counted  towards  the number of crews at the squadron/unit commander's discretion. 2.10.  PNAF Aircrew Qualification and Certification. 2.10.1.  Flying  Qualifications:    Crewmembers  who  occupy  a  primary  PNAF  crew  position when nuclear cargo is airlifted will be qualified according to AFI 11-2C-17V2, C-17 Aircrew Evaluation  Criteria,  and  current  in  both  the  mission  aircraft  and  recurring  PNAF  training requirements  IAW  AFI  11-2C-17V1,  C-17  Aircrew  Training  and  AFI  11-237,  Nuclear Weapons Airlift Training (to be replaced by AFI 13-527, Nuclear Airlift Training).

(T-0)    PNAF  Certified  refers  to  PNAF  Copilot  or  PNAF Loadmaster  Certification.    Officers  must  be  PNAF  Copilot  Certified  before  entering  a formal PNAF Courier or PNAF Aircraft Commander Qualification upgrade.  (T-1) Note:  PNAF Courier and Aircraft Commander Qualification training does not constitute “training with nuclear cargo” as PNAF certification is a prerequisite for either crew position.  2.10.3.7.1.  PNAF  Certified  Copilots  in  formal  upgrade  to  PNAF  Courier  or  PNAF Aircraft  Commander  may  occupy  and  perform  duties  in  a  primary  crew  position  on nuclear missions as long as the individual satisfies the following: 2.10.3.7.1.1.  Current for the weapon type designated for logistics transport (T-1) 2.10.3.7.1.2.  Directly supervised by a qualified PNAF Courier or PNAF Aircraft Commander Instructor counterpart (T-1) 26 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 2.10.3.7.2.  PNAF  Copilot  or  Loadmaster  Trainees  are  authorized  access  to  nuclear cargo missions for the sole purpose of observing certified personnel perform required tasks. (T-1) 2.10.4.  PNAF Training.  Crewmembers in training for PNAF certification/qualification must be interim or formal certified under PRP, have a minimum final SECRET security clearance with  Restricted  Data  (RD)/Formerly  Restricted  Data  (FRD)  and  accomplished  PNAF academic and Nuclear Surety training. (T-2) 2.10.5.  PNAF Evaluations.  Crewmembers on Interim PRP may receive PNAF evaluations.  Commanders will ensure initial  crewmember  evaluations  are not  accomplished on missions carrying nuclear cargo. (T-2) 2.10.6.  PNAF  Certification.    PNAF  squadron/unit  commanders  will  certify  each  nuclear airlift  qualified  crewmember,  including  themselves,  senior  ranking  commanders,  and attached  crewmembers.  (T-2)    Following  OG/CC  review,  the  Wg/CC  will  approve  all crewmember certifications. (T-2)  Document all certifications in the Review and Certification Board  minutes  IAW  AFI  11-202V2,  Aircrew  Standardization/Evaluation  Program,  the appropriate  MAJCOM  supplement,  and  on  the  individual  crewmember’s  AF  Form  4324, Aircraft  Assignment/Aircrew  Qualification  Worksheet 11-2C-17V1.  Crewmembers  will  not  perform  PNAF  duties  with  nuclear  cargo  until  certification  is approved by the Wg/CC. (T-2) IAW  AFI 2.11.  Aircrew Complement.  Use Table 2.1. for minimum aircrew complement on nuclear and nuclear-related cargo airlift missions. Table 2.1.  Aircrew Complement. Crew Position1, 2, 3 PNAF Aircraft Commander PNAF Courier4 PNAF Co-Pilot PNAF Loadmaster Additional PNAF Certified Crewmember5 C-17 1 1 1 2 1 Notes: Note 1.  PNAF qualified and certified in accordance with paragraph 2.10. Note 2.  Non-PNAF flight examiners will not administer evaluations on PNAF missions. (T-2) Note 3.  Squadron/unit commanders will ensure the appropriate crew complement is assigned to meet mission requirements IAW applicable portions of this instruction and AFI 11-2C-17, Vol 3. (T-2) Note 4.  List authorized Couriers in the Mission Setup Message.  Do not annotate on the flight authorization. Note 5.  An additional PRP-certified crewmember will be assigned on missions requiring the Two-Person Concept (TPC). (T-2) 2.12.  Aircrew Replacement, Staging, and Crew Swap. 2.12.1.  Do not replace PNAF crewmembers unless absolutely necessary.  Avoiding Courier replacement is especially critical due to briefing requirements, letters of introduction, Courier AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 27 identification,  and  custody  receipt.    See  Chapter  6  for  specific  procedures  if  a  Courier  is replaced. 2.12.2.  Aircrew  Staging.    Pre-position  PNAF  aircrews  at  forward/en  route  locations  to maximize  performance    in  large  scale  (multi-mission)  movements  or  to  satisfy  aircraft support requirements.  This practice eliminates pre-and de-positioning legs.  It may involve swapping  aircrews  at  an  en  route  location  with  nuclear  cargo  aboard,  but  will  not  involve handling  of  nuclear  cargo  at  the  en  route  location  used.    All  planned  stage  crews  will participate  in  the  pre-departure  briefing  at  home  station  IAW  paragraph  3.2.  (T-2)    During execution,  crewmembers  will  brief  counterparts  on  unique  mission  aspects  not  covered during the pre-departure mission briefing. (T-2) 2.12.2.1.  In order to satisfy aircraft support requirements and/or reduce the overall CDD of some PNAF aircrew members, 618 AOC (TACC) mission planners may elect to pre-position the aircraft from a staging location with only a portion of the designated PNAF aircrew.  Regardless of  when the nuclear  cargo is  onloaded,  re-consolidating the PNAF aircrew  (J-Coded  crewmembers)  at  the  onload  location  is  authorized  to  minimize  the need for a CDD waiver for the entire PNAF aircrew. (T-2) 2.12.3.  Crew  Swap.    A  crew  swap  is  defined  as  using  pre-positioned  aircrews  or  aircrew members to initiate or complete a nuclear mission.  618 AOC (TACC) mission planners and the operational unit should consider all options before implementing crew swap procedures, which should primarily be used to avoid or minimize excessive crew duty-day waivers. (T-2) 2.12.3.1.  A  pre-positioned  aircrew  may  perform  pre-flight  actions,  pre-position  the aircraft,  and  onload  nuclear  cargo  via  normal  procedures  when  used  prior  to  mission departure.    The  pre-positioned  crew  will  transfer  custody  of  the  cargo  and  mission responsibilities to another operating crew to execute the primary mission segment. (T-2)  Transfer  of  custody  and  mission  responsibilities,  if  required,  will  occur  at  an  en  route location with a pre-positioned crew and security to utilize the available crew duty-day of both operating crews.  (T-2) 2.12.3.2.  A pre-positioned aircrew, if required after mission arrival, will accept custody of nuclear cargo and mission responsibilities from the primary crew prior to performing cargo offload, post-flight actions, and aircraft re-positioning (as necessary). 2.12.3.3.  Additional  crews,  either  swapped  or  pending  swap,  will  not  deadhead  with nuclear cargo aboard. (T-2) 2.12.3.4.  Mission  planning.    Mission  planners  will  ensure  all  primary  and  supporting installation  agencies  are  coordinated  with  when  determining  Crew  Swap  SOEs  and procedures for a particular mission. (T-2) 2.12.3.4.1.  Unit mission planners will ensure the appropriate number of PNAF crews are scheduled to complete the mission. (T-2) 2.12.3.4.2.  Create a separate EAL for each crew.  All crewmembers from each crew will  be  listed  on  each  EAL.  (T-2)    Commanders  will  ensure  EALs  designate  each respective  crew’s  Aircraft  Commander  and  Courier  as  Sole  Vouching  Authority (SVA).  (T-2)    Example:    One  EAL  will  annotate  the  upload  crew’s  Aircraft Commander/SVA  and  the  other  will  annotate  the  main  operating  crew’s  Aircraft 28 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 Commander/SVA.    Commanders  will  ensure  both  EALs  list  all  crewmembers assigned to the upload and operating crews. (T-2)  Crews should depart home station with only their crew’s EAL. (T-2) 2.12.3.4.3.  Create one set of crew orders that includes all crews.  Commanders will ensure  appropriate  remarks  are  included  on  the  aircrew  orders  that  indicate when/where  the  transfer  of  Aircraft  Commander  responsibilities  will  occur.    Each crew will depart home station with the same set of  crew orders. (T-2) 2.12.3.4.4.  IAW paragraph 3.2, each participating mission aircrew will participate in the home-station pre-departure briefing. (T-2)  During execution, crewmembers will brief  counterparts  on  unique  mission  aspects  not  covered  during  the  pre-departure mission briefing. (T-2) 2.12.3.5.  During mission execution, the primary Courier should consider out-processing the  originating  aircrew  unless  required  for  mission  execution  or  to  minimize  weapon exposure time. Note:  Mission requirements may warrant the use of pre-positioned PNAF crewmembers to augment a download operation without requiring an entirely new/full aircrew complement.  In these circumstances, crew swap procedures are not required. (T-2) 2.12.3.6.  PNAF  crews  will  use  AMC/A3N  developed  checklist(s)  to  aid  in  crew  swap mission planning and execution. (T-2) AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 29 Chapter 3 PREDEPARTURE REQUIREMENTS 3.1.  Aircrew  Mission  Planning.  Aircrew  mission  planning  has  an  immeasurable  effect  on nuclear surety.

This Chapter outlines en route operational procedures to be used by aircrews and command  and  control  centers  (CCC).    Included  are  procedures  for  communications,  cargo loading and offloading, aircraft emergency diverts, and crew rest. 4.2.  Special Considerations When Transporting Nuclear Cargo. 4.2.1.  Aircraft transporting nuclear cargo are prohibited from approaching within an unsafe distance to an unfriendly border.  Commanders will ensure that positive measures are used to prevent  overflight  or  landing  in  unfriendly  territories  or  countries  where  such  actions  are prohibited. (T-0)  Refer to the SWOG for additional information. 4.2.2.  When  practical,  PNAF  Aircrews  will  avoid  overflight  of  heavily  populated  areas during missions with nuclear cargo-laden. Approach, landing, and takeoff tracks are excluded from this limitation.  The Aircraft Commander should comply with air traffic control (ATC) normal  routings  when  a  request  to  avoid  heavily  populated  areas  would  place  aircraft  in greater danger by conflicting with traffic in crowded airspace.  Beware of ATC instructions that  may  cause  flight  into  unauthorized  areas.    Do  not  reveal  the  purpose  of  the  mission merely to proceed via flight-planned route. 4.2.3.  Aircrew members will not consume alcoholic beverages within 12 hours of crew show time on active legs carrying nuclear cargo. (T-1) 4.2.4.  Current  and  qualified  PNAF  Aircraft  Commander  certified  pilots  may  perform  the takeoff and landing on nuclear cargo-laden missions, provided the designated PNAF Mission Aircraft  Commander  is  occupying  the  other  pilot  seat.  (T-1)    Exception:  PNAF  Aircraft Commander  candidates  (Instructor  or  higher)  entered  in  the  formal  PNAF  Aircraft Commander training program may accomplish takeoffs and landings provided the designated PNAF Mission Aircraft Commander (pilot-in-command) is an Instructor pilot or higher and is occupying the other seat. (T-1) 4.2.5.  Aircrew  members  and  associated  personnel  will  strive  to  minimize  the  time  nuclear cargo  is  exposed  outside  secure  storage.  (T-1)    Coordinate  fully  with  support  agencies, shippers, and receivers.  Keep them informed of mission progress and intentions. 4.2.6.  When nuclear cargo is aboard, do not land early unless absolutely necessary and base agencies  have  been  notified.    (T-1)    If  a  takeoff  at  the  published  departure  time  would generate an early arrival (due to unexpected en route winds, etc.), stay on the ground where security  is  known  and  established.    The  Aircraft  Commander  will  coordinate  with  proper CCC  and  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOOOD  for  later  takeoff  time.    If  an  early  arrival  cannot  be avoided  en  route,  ensure  mission  requirements  are  passed  to  the  arrival  base  and  are completely understood.  The Aircraft commander or Courier will obtain official confirmation (names,  initials,  etc.)  from  the  arrival  destination  to  indicate  that  updated  requirements  are understood and will be coordinated.  At a minimum, ensure security forces are notified and can  provide  required  support.   Inform  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOC  and  618  AOC (TACC)/XOOOD of the early arrival. AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 35 4.2.7.  Security Alternate Fuel.  When fuel planning for nuclear and nuclear-related mission segments,  include  sufficient  fuel  (10,000  pounds  for  C-17)  to  permit  departure  from destination  and  climb  to  an  appropriate  altitude  to  level  off  with  "required  overhead"  fuel.  List this fuel in the "stored fuel" on the appropriate fuel planning form according to AFI 11-2C-17V3.    Security  alternate  fuel  is  designed  for  all  missions  to  allow  the  Aircraft Commander  the  option  of  departure  from  an  immature  or  deteriorating  security  situation.  This is in addition to all other required fuel.  Do not offload nuclear or nuclear-related cargo to allow for security alternate fuel.  General cargo should be offloaded to allow for security alternate fuel. (T-1) 4.2.8.  Flight  Planning.    Enter  "hazardous  cargo,"  "inert  devices,"  or  both  if  applicable  and the mission number in the "remarks" section of the DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, or in the "other information" section of the DD Form 1801, DoD International Flight Plan.  (T-0 ) Note:  LLCs with line numbers and certain Type 3 trainers and JTAs are hazardous cargo. 4.2.9.  On  air  refueled  mission  segments  transporting  nuclear  or  nuclear-related  cargo,  use the pre-coordinated emergency divert location designated in the Mission Setup Message if at all  possible.    If  a  different  emergency  divert  location  is  necessary,  inform  the  controlling CCC as soon as possible so the duty controller can advise the new emergency divert location.  Before  takeoff,  the  Aircraft  Commander  must  ensure  the  new  emergency  divert  location confirms security is available. (T-2) 4.2.10.  Aircraft Firefighting Support Requirements when transporting, loading or unloading nuclear cargo or nuclear-related cargo: 4.2.10.1.  On-Scene  Coordinators  (OSC)  will  ensure  fire  protection  is  provided  during engine starts, servicing, taxi, takeoff and landing IAW TP 20-11 or Engineering Liaison Office Publication 1 (ELO-1) for host nation fire departments. (T-0) 4.2.10.2.  At  Air  Force  bases,  do  not  display  hazardous  cargo  placards  (explosives category 1.1, etc.).  The host determines use of placards at other bases. 4.3.  Aircraft Preparation. 4.3.1.  Do  not  service  or  perform  aircraft  maintenance  during  nuclear  cargo  loading  or unloading  operations  (concurrent  servicing).    Refer  to  AFI  91-115  for  specific  aircraft maintenance requirements and considerations.  The nuclear cargo convoy will not normally depart the storage site until the aircraft is serviced, security is established, and the aircrew is ready for loading. (T-1) 4.3.2.  Aircrews  will  ensure  appropriate  T.O.  1C-17A-16-1  and  T.O.  1C-17A-9,  Loading Instructions,  preloading  checklists  are  complete  prior  to  commencing  onload  of  nuclear cargo. (T-1) 4.3.3.  The  OSC  and  Aircraft  Commander  and  will  ensure  fire  protection  requirements directed  in  TP  20-11  are  satisfied  prior  to  conducting  loading,  offloading  and  servicing operations with nuclear cargo on board. (T-0) 4.3.4.  Commanders or designated representative (e.g. On-Scene Coordinator) will ensure the necessary aerospace ground equipment (AGE) and support equipment is prepositioned at the designated  parking  area  before  aircraft  arrival.  (T-2)   Commanders  or  designated representative  will  ensure  the  equipment  is  inspected  for  serviceability,  fully  serviced,  and 36 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 sanitized before placement  at  the parking area. (T-1)  Ensure AGE equipment is  positioned so it does not block taxi routes or aircraft avenues of exit. 4.4.  Two-Person  Concept  (TPC).  See  AFI  91-104,  Nuclear  Surety  Tamper  Control  and Detection  Program,  for  TPC  and  no-lone  zone  guidance  and  DoD  S-5210.41-M_AFMAN  31-108, Volume 3, Enclosure 9 for exclusion area guidance. 4.4.1.  Aircrews  will  apply  the  TPC  when  airlifting  nuclear  cargo.  (T-0)    As  the  Sole Vouching Authority (SVA), the Courier will ensure an exclusion area is established, aircrew and  security  personnel  are  briefed  on  exclusion  area  procedures  and individual responsibilities,  and  enforce  TPC.  (T-0)    While  it  is  the  Courier’s  primary  responsibility, compliance  and  enforcement  are  everyone's  concern  regardless  of  who  has  physical possession of nuclear cargo.  Note:  An individual may enter a lavatory within an exclusion area without continuous direct observation by the remaining TPC team. 4.4.2.  Individual  TPC  team  members  must  be  certified  under  their  respective  service-directed PRP and thoroughly briefed on the location of the exclusion area. (T-0)  They must be familiar with the safety and security requirements of the task to be performed. (T-0) The TPC team must be a minimum of two PRP-certified individuals. (T-0)  Two interim certified individuals will not form a TPC team. (T-0) 4.4.3.  A TPC team will escort persons not certified under PRP and comply with applicable escort ratios IAW AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, and DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108.  (T-0)    Non-PRP  individuals  will  be  kept  to  a  minimum,  taking  into  account  the  nuclear cargo,  mission  complexity,  crew  work/rest  cycles,  expected  visitor  activity,  and  ability  to effectively control all visitors. (T-0)  It is the Courier’s responsibility to ensure anyone who has access, understands and complies with the rules in the exclusion area. 4.4.4.  Two-Person Concept for Inspectors: 4.4.4.1.  Upon proper identification and authentication of inspector’s EAL, PRP-certified inspectors may be authorized unescorted entry into the restricted area by the Courier. 4.4.4.2.  PRP-certified  inspectors  will  not  form  a  TPC  team  with  crewmembers  or personnel  receiving  the  inspection.  (T-0)    PRP-certified  inspectors  will  form  an independent  TPC  team  to  ensure  the  inspection  doesn’t  impact  the  performance  of aircrew duties. (T-0) 4.5.  Cargo Acceptance and Transfer. 4.5.1.  The  Courier  will  accept  and  transfer  custody  of  nuclear  cargo  IAW  T.O.  11N-45-51 and  Chapter  6  of  this  regulation.  (T-0)    Only  nuclear  cargo  identified  in  the  Mission  Setup Message and Airlift Request may be accepted and handled.  If cargo differs from the Mission Setup Message and Airlift Request, follow procedures IAW paragraph 2.7.3. 4.5.2.  Aircrew  will  not  accept  opportune  or  non-nuclear  cargo  on  PNAF  SAAMs  without prior  MAJCOM  coordination  through  the  SLA.  (T-1)    The  SLA  will  indicate  approval  of additional  cargo  by  providing  618  AOC  (TACC)  an  updated  SAAM  Airlift  Request.  Updated cargo information identified in the SAAM Airlift Request will be incorporated into a change to the Mission Setup Message. (T-2) 4.5.3.  Custody and Physical Possession.  Possession occurs at the pre-determined point when the aircrew or receiver “takes” physical control of each item of cargo.  Munitions personnel AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 37 assisting  in  aircrew  loading  operations  do  so  under  the  control  of  and  on  behalf  of  the Courier.    Before  transfer  of  custody  occurs,  the  Courier,  shipper/receiver,  and  Senior  SF representative (SNCO or Officer) will agree where each piece of cargo is to be relocated in case of attack or emergency, irrespective of who has custody e.g., during loading operations, if cargo chains are removed, the cargo may be brought on board for defense. (T-1)  Refer to AFI 21-205 (C/FRD) for additional guidance. 4.6.  Loading  and  Offloading  Procedures.  Commanders  will  ensure  nuclear  cargo  is  only loaded  on  a  mission  capable  aircraft  serviced  and  prepared  for  loading.  (T-1)    The  Aircraft Commander  and  aircrew  are  responsible  for  safe  and  proper  loading  of  nuclear  cargo.    The Aircraft  Commander  will  personally  monitor  all  loading  operations  of  nuclear  cargo  by  direct reference  to  T.O  1C-17A-16-1  or  T.O  1C-17A-16-1CL-1.  (T-1)    Note:    Do  not  load  nuclear cargo on PNAF aircraft unless a loading procedure is published in T.O 1C-17A-16-1. 4.6.1.  The  primary  Loadmaster,  in  coordination  with  the  Aircraft  Commander,  will  direct loading, tie down, load distribution, and shipping preparation of nuclear cargo. (T-1)  During loading operations, the primary Loadmaster may transfer responsibilities to another certified PNAF Loadmaster to accomplish some or all primary Loadmaster responsibilities. (T-1) 4.6.2.  Use T.O. 1C-17A-16-1 or T.O. 1C-17A-9 procedures for loading and offloading.  The appropriate T.O. by type of cargo is specified in T.O. 11N-45-51A (S-RD) and Attachment 2.  No  deviations  to  these  T.O.  procedures  are  authorized.    Commanders  will  ensure  weapons are configured for shipment IAW the appropriate weapons dash-1 T.O. before presenting to aircrew for logistics transport. (T-0) 4.6.3.  The Aircraft Commander and primary Loadmaster will ensure all personnel involved in  the  loading  operation  understand  their  duties  before  each  onload  and  offload.  (T-1)  Shippers  or  receivers  may  be  asked  to  assist  with  loading  operations.    The  Aircraft Commander will ensure shippers or receivers are thoroughly briefed and comply with AMC aircrew procedures while cargo is in aircrew custody or physical possession. (T-1) 4.6.4.  Use  nuclear  weapon  protective  covers  as  much  as  possible  to  minimize  visual exposure.  Host installations shall consider prohibiting restricted area photography for force protection  or  OPSEC  concerns.  (T-0)   If  local  installations  prohibit  photography, Commanders  should  consider  incorporating  procedures  in  the  installation  defense  plan  for photography authorization requests. 4.6.5.  Aircrew  may  touch  nuclear  cargo  as  necessary  to  facilitate  onload,  offload,  and inflight  duties  IAW  T.O.  1C-17A-16-1,  T.O.  1C-17A-9,  and    T.O.  11N-45-51A  (S-RD).  Crew members should avoid excessive handling of nuclear cargo.  Handle only one item or package of nuclear cargo at a time.  When hand-carrying, use both hands if practical. 4.6.6.  Forecast or actual inclement weather (high winds, ice storms, etc.): 4.6.6.1.  Onload  and  offload  can  be  delayed  due  to  local  policies  or  the  Aircraft Commander's judgment. 4.6.6.2.  Do  not  load  nuclear  cargo  containing  explosives  when  an  electrical  storm  is within 10 miles unless cargo would be safer inside aircraft.  (T-0) 38 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 4.6.6.3.  During  the  shipper’s  brief,  the  Courier  and  MASO  will  coordinate  procedures establishing  custody  and  security  of  nuclear  cargo  when  the  aircraft  is  partially on/offloaded and weather has temporarily ceased operations. (T-2) 4.6.7.  To minimize aircraft noise during loading operations, the Aircraft Commander should utilize the ground power unit (GPU) as the primary source of aircraft power.  At a minimum, the  GPU  should  be  connected  to  provide  a  backup  source  of  aircraft  power.    The  Aircraft Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) should primarily be used in the following situations: sufficient GPU  is  not  available,  required  for  avionics  cooling,  or  required  to  heat  the  aircraft  during cold weather operations. 4.6.8.  Crew members will maintain a 30-inch space between general or nuclear-related cargo and the nearest nuclear cargo. (T-1) 4.6.9.  The  primary  Loadmaster  will  identify  and  brief  the  aircrew  which  cargo  can  and cannot be jettisoned.  (T-1)  This is a physical determination with reference to limitations of AFMAN  24-204(I),  T.O.  1C-17A-16-1  or  T.O.  1C-17A-9.    Note:  AFMAN  24-204(I)  is applicable to general cargo only and does not apply to nuclear weapon major assemblies and nuclear components packaged and shipped IAW T.O. 11N-45-51 and it’s supplements. 4.7.  Ground Emergencies. 4.7.1.  Anyone observing an unsafe act or condition during any ground phase of the nuclear cargo  mission  will  immediately  stop  the  operation.  (T-0)    Correct  the  condition  before operations  are  resumed.    Report  all  ground  emergencies  to  the  OSC.    While  the  Aircraft Commander  retains  responsibility  for  the  aircraft,  the  OSC  is  responsible  for  coordinating incident  response  actions  and  will  integrate  into  the  installation  Incident  Command  System (ICS) structure. (T-1) 4.7.1.1.  The  Aircraft  Commander  will  coordinate  with  the  OSC  to  contact  the  local safety  office  and  evacuate  non-essential  personnel  as  briefed  when  an  accident  occurs during the loading of nuclear cargo and the case is dropped but intact. (T-0)  Do not ship items which have been exposed to abnormal conditions unless specifically authorized. (T-0) 4.7.1.2.  In the event  nuclear cargo is dropped or damaged during handling and the case is  ruptured,  personnel  involved  in  the  loading  operation  will  take  the  following immediate actions: 4.7.1.2.1.  Coordinate  emergency  actions  through  the  OSC,  security  forces,  and  fire department.    Notify  tower  or  ground  control  requesting  them  to  notify  the  local support United States EOD team immediately and declare a ground emergency. (T-0) 4.7.1.2.2.  Evacuate  nonessential  persons  upwind  a  minimum  of  2,500  feet,  if possible, or as briefed. (T-0) 4.7.2.  Security Emergencies.  Coordination and planning prior to mission arrival and during initial communications between the aircrew and Senior Security Forces Representative (SSR) are essential to ensure security of nuclear cargo.  Aircrew members and associated personnel will adhere to Nuclear Weapon Security Standards. (T-0) AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 39 4.7.2.1.  If  confronted  with  hostile  force,  deadly  force  is  authorized  to  protect  nuclear cargo.  Resist any attempt by a hostile force to capture nuclear cargo to the fullest extent possible. 4.7.2.2.  Consider any attack on aircraft loaded with nuclear cargo, including a hijacking attempt, as an attack against nuclear cargo. 4.7.2.3.  Should  hostages  be  used  to  gain  access  to,  as  cover  for  removal,  or  to  thwart recovery  of  nuclear  cargo,  the  welfare  and  safety  of  hostages  should  be  considered  in determining  actions  to  be  taken.    However,  Commanders  will  ensure  the  presence  of hostages  do  not  deter  taking  decisive,  prompt,  and  effective  action  that  includes  using deadly force to prevent unauthorized access, removal or recovery of nuclear cargo. (T-0) 4.7.2.4.  If  attacked  during  a    PNAF  logistics  movement,  aircrew  and  associated personnel should take the following actions: 4.7.2.4.1.  If  attack  occurs  during  an  onload  or  offload,  respond  IAW  the  pre-coordinated security response plan.  If the decision is made to load the nuclear cargo on  board  the  aircraft,  conduct  the  operation  as  expeditiously  and  safely  as  possible.  Refer to AFI 21-205, Command Disable System (C/FRD) for additional guidance. 4.7.2.4.2.  If the Aircraft Commander determines the aircraft is airworthy and the taxi and departure routes are safer than remaining in place, consider making an immediate takeoff with the cargo IAW previously coordinated security response plans. 4.7.3.  Some weapons are equipped with a command disable system (CDS). 4.7.3.1.  CDS  codes  and  at  least  one  individual  knowledgeable  in  CDS  procedures  will remain on the aircraft until Type I security is established after arrival and when ropes and stanchions are removed until departure. (T-0) 4.7.3.2.  CDS is the only disablement procedure authorized for PNAF aircrews. (T-0) 4.7.3.3.  Commanders will ensure CDS authorization, protection of codes, and procedures for execution are IAW T.O 11N-45-51 and AFI 21-205 (C/FRD). (T-0) 4.8.  Procedures  for  Cross-load  Transfer  of  Nuclear  Cargo.  An  aircraft  change  may  be necessary  during  a  nuclear  airlift  mission  due  to  maintenance  or  other  unforeseen  problems.  This could occur at home station, en route, or at an emergency divert location.  Aircraft change may  require  a  cross-load  of  the  nuclear  cargo  to  keep  it  moving  to  its  final  destination.    If  a cross-load transfer is required, the following procedures will help ensure a safe, secure transfer of nuclear cargo from one aircraft to another.  In the interest of safety and security, refer to the following guidance when conducting nuclear cargo cross-load operations: 4.8.1.  Whenever possible, cross-loads should be performed by personnel who are trained and certified IAW AFI 21-204, Nuclear Weapons Maintenance Procedures in the performance of handling  and  transportation  tasks.  (T-1)    In  emergency  or  contingency  situations  where  no certified handling personnel are present, PNAF aircrew are authorized to conduct cross-load operations IAW AFI 91-115. (T-1) 4.8.2.  Aircraft Commanders will ensure cross-loads of nuclear cargo do not  begin  until  the replacement aircraft has been fully configured, undergone preflight actions, fueled, sanitized, and appropriate security requirements are in place. (T-1) 40 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 4.8.3.  One Courier will maintain custody of the nuclear cargo throughout the cross-load. (T-1)  Couriers will ensure any transfer of custody occurs before the cross-load begins or after the cross-load is complete. (T-1) 4.8.4.  PNAF  aircrew  will  ensure  the  safest  and  most  secure  environment  for  any  nuclear cargo involved in the cross-load. (T-1)  Use nuclear weapon protective covers (if available) to  minimize  visual  exposure.    PNAF  aircrews  will  remove  protective  covers  immediately prior to inspecting weapons and conducting loading/offloading operations (when the aircrew takes possession of each weapon). (T-2) 4.8.5.  Use a single Protection Level 1 (restricted) area around both cross-load aircraft to the maximum  extent  possible.    The  receiving  aircraft  will  be  sanitized  IAW  Chapter  5 requirements before the Type-I restricted area is expanded around both cross-load aircraft. 4.8.6.  The  Aircrew  is  responsible  for  directing  the  cross-load  operation  and  will  work closely  with  the  base  commander  or  OSC,  shipper  or  receiver,  munitions,  security, intelligence, and transportation personnel to execute the operation. (T-1) 4.8.7.  The  Aircraft  Commander  and  Courier  will  conduct  briefings  with  all  personnel participating in the cross-load operation. (T-1)  The briefings will provide an overview of the cross-load operation and direct specific individual responsibilities and requirements.  Before the  operation,  the  Courier  officer  will  brief  security,  cargo,  and  no-lone  zone  requirements and the Primary Loadmaster will brief loading/offloading duties. 4.8.8.  The  Courier  will  coordinate  with  the  SSR  to  ensure  security  requirements  are understood and security is adequate before commencing the cross-load operation. (T-1)  The Courier will also ensure no-lone zones are briefed and understood by all participants. (T-1) 4.8.9.  Use T.O. 1C-17A-16-1 or T.O. 1C-17A-9 procedures for loading and offloading.  The appropriate T.O. by type of cargo is specified in T.O. 11N-45-51A (S-RD) and Attachment 2.  No  deviations  to  these  T.O.  procedures  are  authorized.    Weapon  configurations  will  be directed for shipment IAW the applicable weapon dash-1 T.O. (S-RD). 4.8.10.  If a PNAF aircrew is required to conduct a cross-load of nuclear cargo and transfer custody  to  another  PNAF  aircrew,  both  PNAF  Aircraft  Commanders  will  agree  which aircrew  is  responsible  for  accomplishing  each  phase  of  cross-load  operation.    Unless circumstances  dictate  otherwise,  the  outgoing  PNAF  aircrew  should  conduct  the  cargo download and the new PNAF aircrew should conduct the cargo upload.  Transfer of physical possession will be thoroughly briefed and understood by all aircrew members engaged in the operation.  The new Courier will assume custody of the nuclear cargo by signing of the DD 1911. (T-1)  Couriers will ensure all authorized personnel assisting with the operation clearly understand who is  in  charge of each piece of  cargo/weapon  and its disposition  at  all times. (T-1) 4.8.10.1.  The  primary  Loadmaster  of  the  new  aircraft,  with  coordination  from  the Aircraft  Commander,  will  direct  the  nuclear  cargo  movement  operation  to  the  new aircraft. (T-1) 4.9.  Departure Procedures. 4.9.1.  Destination Support Confirmation. AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 41 4.9.1.1.  PNAF Aircraft  Commanders will not  takeoff with  nuclear cargo on board until all destinations and identified emergency divert locations acknowledge they are capable and ready to provide pre-coordinated security requirements. (T-1) 4.9.1.2.  Before  beginning  each  day's  operation,  the  PNAF  Aircraft  Commander  will contact the MAJCOM CCC to confirm the status of stations scheduled to be transited that day. (T-2)  CCC will review the mission folder to ensure all stations on the day's itinerary have confirmed security and support requirements. (T-2)  If security is questionable or a 24-hour  confirmation  message  has  not  been  received,  CCC  will  immediately  attempt  to confirm security and hold departure to the suspect station until security is confirmed. (T-2)  If the 24-hour confirmation message is not available, MAJCOM CCC will contact the destination  base  directly.    If  required,  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOOOD  can  provide  base contacts and telephone numbers. 4.9.2.  Engine-Start  Notification.    Before  engine-start,  the  PNAF  aircrew  will  contact  the controlling agency (ground or tower) and provide the following information:  aircraft parking location,  approximate  engine-start  time,  and  hazardous  cargo  is  on  board  the  aircraft.  (T-1)  The PNAF Aircraft Commander will ensure a minimum of one Major Crash Vehicle (MCV) is available for engine start  IAW T.O. 11N-20-11. (T-0)  Reference T.O. 11N-20-11 for all other fire-fighting requirements. 4.9.3.  Release of Security.  When directed by the  Aircraft Commander, the Courier officer will  direct  security  guards  to  remove  any  barriers  outlining  the  restricted  area.  (T-0)    The security  force  will  maintain  surveillance  of  the  aircraft  until  it  is  airborne  and  remain available  for  recall  30-minutes  thereafter,  or  as  otherwise  coordinated  in  the  Mission  Setup Message. (T-0) 4.9.4.  Departure Message: 4.9.4.1.  Once  airborne,  the  aircrew  will  contact  the  CCC  via  any  means  necessary (ACARS, radio, phone patch, etc) and provide an updated departure time and estimated time of arrival (ETA). (T-1) 4.9.4.2.  CCC will notify destination point of contact (identified in their acknowledgment message)  by  the  most  expeditious  means  available  and  pass  aircraft  type,  mission number, tail number, and ETA. (T-1)  Insist security forces be notified.  If CCC is unable to  contact  destination,  they  will  advise  the  Aircraft  Commander.  (T-1)    The  Aircraft Commander will make the final decision to land or divert to a pre-coordinated emergency divert location. (T-1)  If there is a reasonable doubt the security of nuclear cargo could be jeopardized  if  the  aircraft  lands,  divert  to  a  suitable  alternate  that  can  provide  security.  Note:    OPSEC  procedures  are  extremely  important  during  this  process.    Make  every effort  to  avoid  "signatures"  of  a  nuclear  cargo  mission.    Avoid  discussions  that  could reveal the purpose of the mission. 4.9.4.3.  For  missions  with  brief  en  route  times  or  several  quick  stops  that  would  make departure  calls  to  destinations  impractical,  CCC  should  contact  destinations  before  the aircraft departs and provide required information. (T-2) 4.10.  CCC Coordination. 42 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 4.10.1.  PNAF aircrew will advise 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG of mission progress to include all ETA changes of 15 minutes or more. (T-1)  618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG will relay relevant aircrew mission updates to the arrival destination’s C2 agency as soon as possible. (T-1) 4.10.2.  Releasing Pre-coordinated Emergency Divert Locations. 4.10.2.1.  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOOOD  will  develop  Mission  Setup  Message  support requirements for applicable pre-coordinated emergency divert locations. (T-2)  Bases will be  tasked  to  support  the  unlikely  event  of  an  emergency  divert  for  any  reason  (e.g. Weather, A/R, maintenance, etc.).  618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD will coordinate with the operating unit during mission planning to establish standby posture requirements and key time points/related mission milestones (completion of A/R, ETP passage, etc.). (T-2) 4.10.2.2.  The  Aircraft  Commander  will  contact  the  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOCG-DDO2 after  sequencing  key  time  points/related  mission  milestones.  (T-2)    Upon  concurrence with  the  Aircraft  Commander,  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOCG-DDO2  will  contact  the  pre-coordinated  emergency  divert  location  command  post  to  release  installation  standby requirements. (T-2) 4.10.3.  Aircraft Divert.  The Aircraft Commander will inform 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG as soon  as  possible  after  coordinating  any  divert  with  air  traffic  control  agencies.  (T-1)    618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG will notify the pre-coordinated emergency divert location, appropriate en route agencies, host nation authorities, and original destination to advise them the aircraft is diverting. (T-1) 4.11.  Arrival Procedures. 4.11.1.  In-Flight Notification: 4.11.1.1.  At least 30-minutes prior to the ETA, the PNAF aircrew will contact one of the following C2 agencies to confirm the arrival base is ready for aircraft arrival (in order of preference):  (1) Command Post, (2) Base Operations, or (3) Control Tower.  The aircrew should request the coordinating C2 agency relay the updated ETA to appropriate support agencies,  as  well  as the  Security Acknowledgment Message. the  single  point-of-contact identified in 4.11.1.2.  If  the  arrival  base  does  not  have  hazardous  cargo  information,  request  the following  be  relayed  immediately  to  the  crash-fire  protection  agency  and  other  support agencies as appropriate: 4.11.1.2.1.  Aircraft call sign, type, and mission number. 4.11.1.2.2.  ETA. 4.11.1.2.3.  DoD explosives hazard class and division. 4.11.1.2.4.  Request for special handling (isolated parking, security, etc.). 4.11.1.2.5.  Line numbers (if requested). 4.11.1.3.  On  legs  with  no  hazardous  cargo  aboard,  pass  the  call  sign,  mission  number, and any special requests to the appropriate agency at least 30-minutes before ETA. 4.11.2.  Taxi and Parking.  It is the Aircraft Commander's responsibility to make host airfield operations  aware  of  the  need  for  isolated  parking.  (T-1)  It  is  a  host  base  responsibility  to AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 43 ensure the taxi route and parking spot meet the quantity-distance separation requirements of AFMAN 91201,  Explosives  Safety  Standards,  and  T.O.  11N(cid:173)45(cid:173)51A  (S-RD).  (T-1)    An explosive/nuclear-laden  aircraft  is  classified  as  an  above  ground  unbarricaded  storage magazine. 4.11.3.  Arrival  Message.    Contact  CCC  with  unclassified  arrival  information  as  soon  as possible after landing.  CCC will dispatch arrival message. (T-2)  The Aircraft Commander will ensure land times have been transmitted to appropriate C2 facilities as soon as possible after landing (verify via local AMCCs/CPs or confirmation the aircraft’s automated reporting system has sent both and ‘On the Deck’ and ‘In Blocks’ notifications). (T-2)  If notification is in question or has not been sent, contact CCC with unclassified arrival information as soon as possible after landing.  CCC will dispatch arrival message. (T-2) 4.11.4.  Security.    Immediately  upon  block-in,  Courier  designated  aircrew  members  will deplane.  (T-1)    Keep  aircraft  doors  closed  and  delay  preparation  for  nuclear  cargo  transfer until  security  is  established  IAW  DoD  S-5210.41-M_AFMAN  31-108  requirements.  (T-0)  Note:    If  Security  Forces  do  not  meet  the  aircraft,  the  Courier  must  decide  whether  the nuclear  cargo would be  more secure  airborne. (T-0)  Consider such factors as:  fuel aboard, weather,  local  air  traffic  density,  local  security  threat,  and  prospects  for  obtaining  proper security  support  within  a  reasonable  time.    If  necessary,  depart  destination  base  and  orbit overhead until assured of proper security support or divert. 4.11.4.1.  The  Courier  and  designated  security  forces  representative  will  review  pre-coordinated  security  requirements.    Confirmation  of  date-time-groups  (DTGs)  on applicable  Security  Briefing  Worksheets  and  local  threat  assessments  constitutes acknowledgement  of  required  briefing  information  (see  paragraph  5.10).  (T-2)    The Courier and security forces representative should only brief information that differs from the pre-coordinated security briefings.  Examples of required briefing updates include but are  not  limited  to:    schedule  changes,  maintenance  problems,  evacuation  points,  or  any other  situation  that  affect  loading  times,  convoy  times,  or  security  status.  (T-2)    The Courier and security forces representative will ensure all questions about forms or cargo is resolved before accepting cargo. (T-2) 4.11.4.2.  Ensure  all  agencies  supporting  the  mission  are  informed  of  the  sequence  of ground operations. 4.11.5.  On-Scene Coordinator.  The Aircraft Commander or Courier will meet the OSC after security is established. (T-2) 4.12.  Divert to Alternate Airfield. 4.12.1.  Refer to the SWOG for additional guidance on divert locations, unscheduled landing, and inadvertent overflight procedures.  If controlling CCC determines security at destination is inadequate, contact aircrew by the most expeditious means and direct divert to a location with adequate security. (T-1)  If security is questionable, a decision to continue to destination should be based on host-theater logistics and Security Forces concurrence. 4.12.2.  If  pre-coordinated  emergency  divert  locations  cannot  be  used  or  as  listed  in  the SWOG,  alternate  locations  may  be  considered  according  to  the  SWOG  priority  and  the following: 44 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 4.12.2.1.  Be under US military control. 4.12.2.2.  Have adequate security.  DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108  and the SWOG contain additional information on security guidance for PNAF emergency diverts. 4.12.2.3.  Should  have  a  nuclear  storage  capability.    Consider  the  type  of  cargo  to  be handled,  e.g.    Army  units  are  not  certified  to  handle  and  maintain  Air  Force  nuclear weapons.   Every  attempt should be made to  store nuclear cargo on the  aircraft while at non-nuclear  emergency  divert  location  or  at  a  location  without  nuclear  storage  capacity during entire ground time. 4.12.3.  Ensure the route to be flown to the divert location is compatible with the SWOG. (T-0) 4.12.4.  If aircraft maintenance is the cause or a contributing factor for an emergency divert, consider  maintenance  capability  at  the  alternate  location.    Security  support  and  possible nuclear storage capability are the most important factors. 4.12.5.  If  the  divert  location  is  in  CONUS  or  a  US  military  base  in  a  foreign  country,  use procedures in the SWOG as well as the following additional guidance: 4.12.5.1.  The  aircrew  should  direct  the  controlling  CCC  to  relay  hazardous  cargo information  and  coordinate  arrangements  for  security,  storage,  etc.    To  the  max  extent possible, the Aircraft Commander should provide a 30(cid:173)minute in-flight notification prior to arrival. 4.12.5.2.  If  unable  to  contact  CCC  or  if  CCC  cannot  contact  alternate  base,  during  the 30-minute notification, the aircrew should request security forces meet the aircraft upon arrival. 4.12.6.  If the airfield is in a foreign country, but not under US military control, the Aircraft Commander  should  contact  the  controlling  CCC  and  relay  the  aircraft  call  sign,  mission number, aircraft type, airport of intended landing, ETA, and reason for the emergency divert.  In coordination with the 618 AOC (TACC), Aircraft Commanders should request assistance from  nearest  Air  Force  base,  American  Embassy,  or  consulate.    Landing  in  any  foreign country  with  nuclear  weapons  on  board  is  extremely  sensitive  and  should  be  handled  as discreetly  as  possible  with  the  agency  controlling  the  field.  Aircraft  Commanders  should make every effort to keep the mission as inconspicuous as possible while still protecting the nuclear cargo.  Use procedures in the DoD FCG to protect the sensitivity, which states, "US military  aircraft  are  sovereign  instrumentalities.”    Under  international  law,  military  aircraft are State aircraft and are therefore, entitled to the privileges and immunities accorded to State aircraft consistent with international custom and practice, and in the absence of stipulations to  the  contrary,  these  immunities  include:      exemption  from  duties  and  taxation;  immunity from  search,  seizure,  and  inspections  (including  customs  and  safety  inspections);  and immunity from other exercises of jurisdiction by the host nation over aircraft, and personnel, equipment, or cargo aboard aircraft.  Note that once personnel, equipment, and/or cargo are no longer on the aircraft, different legal standards may apply. 4.12.6.1.  Air Force Aircraft Commanders will not  authorize search, seizure, inspection, or  similar  exercises  of  jurisdiction  enumerated  above  by  foreign  authorities  except  by direction of Air Force headquarters or the American Embassy in the country concerned. AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 45 (T-0)  Diplomatically,  but  firmly,  deny  any  access  to  aircraft  by  foreign  officials  and attempt to have US officials in the country resolve the problem. 4.13.  Emergency  Procedures.  During  any  emergency,  aircrew  must  take  every  precaution  to protect lives and property. (T-0)  The following emergency procedures apply: 4.13.1.  Pass  the  following  information  to  appropriate  ATC  agency  and  request  it  be communicated to the divert location: (T-1) 4.13.1.1.  Aircraft call sign, nature of the emergency and landing intentions. 4.13.1.2.  Aircraft position and ETA to destination. 4.13.1.3.  Number of personnel aboard. 4.13.1.4.  Fuel aboard. 4.13.1.5.  Hazardous cargo is aboard. 4.13.2.  Make a 30-minute prior-to-arrival radio call to the destination base to include: (T-1) 4.13.2.1.  Line numbers (if base is under U.S. control-or understands T.O. 11N-20-11). 4.13.2.2.  Location of the cargo. 4.13.2.3.  A  statement  that  "negative  hazardous  cargo  is  aboard"  when  aircraft  carries inert devices only. 4.13.2.4.  A  description  of  the  physical  appearance  and  location  in  the  aircraft  of  inert devices when mixed loads of hazardous material and inert devices are aboard. 4.13.3.  If  an  emergency  requires  an  immediate  landing  and  the  Aircraft  Commander  must choose  between  communication  security  and  flight  safety,  safety  takes  precedence.  (T-1)  Classified information may be disclosed only to the extent necessary for safety of flight. 4.13.4.  Jettisoning Nuclear Cargo.  In an emergency, the Aircraft Commander bears a moral obligation to jettison cargo or crash-land in a location where he/she estimates will cause the least  amount  of  damage.    The  Courier  is  responsible  for  the  activation  of  CDS  equipped items before jettisoning or crash landing.  (T-1)  The aircrew will record the coordinates of each piece of jettisoned cargo.  Observe jettison restrictions in the SWOG. (T-0) 4.13.5.  Lightning  Strikes.    Any  time  an  aircraft  transporting  nuclear  cargo  is  struck  by lightning  or  has  a  significant  static  discharge  that  could  affect  the  nuclear  cargo  or components, inspect cargo and take the following actions: 4.13.5.1.  If there are signs of damage, land as soon as possible where a USAF EOD team is available and can provide initial evaluation of weapons condition.  Isolate aircraft with cargo  aboard  and  request  USAF  EOD  support.    If  USAF  EOD  support  is  not  available then  request  support  from  the  nearest  Service  EOD  team  that  can  provide  initial evaluation of the weapons condition.  Initiate official request for USAF EOD support to the weapons custodial installation for USAF EOD support. 4.13.5.2.  If there are no signs of damage, continue the flight to the scheduled destination and have the weapons inspected by USAF EOD team and nuclear weapons personnel as soon as possible. 46 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 4.13.5.3.  File  an  accident,  incident,  or  deficiency  (AID)  report  IAW  AFMAN  91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports. (T-1) 4.14.  Border Clearance Procedures. 4.14.1.  Purpose.  To give aircrews border clearance procedures when carrying nuclear cargo or warheads, LLCs, and classified nuclear support materiel. 4.14.2.  Policy  and  Procedures.    Border  clearance  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Aircraft Commander. 4.14.2.1.  Use general border clearance procedures in AFI 11-2C-17V3, C17 Operations Procedures. 4.14.2.2.  Prepare cargo manifests (DD Form 1385, Cargo Manifest) for customs officials on all cargo.  The shipper will supply manifests for unclassified non-nuclear cargo. (T-2)  Loadmasters  will  prepare  manifests  for  nuclear  cargo  and  other  classified  cargo.  Loadmasters  will  designate  cargo  on  manifests  as  classified  ordnance,  classified electronics  equipment,  classified  test  equipment,  or  similar  wording  and  annotate  the number  of  units,  weight,  and  cubic  displacement  (in  feet).  (T-2).    Loadmasters  will ensure cargo manifests do not associate cargo with nuclear material. (T-2) 4.14.2.3.  Waivers  of  Customs  and  Quarantine  Boarding.    If  required,  the  Aircraft Commander  will  provide  appropriate  agents  a  waiver  from  Customs  and  Quarantine Boarding  and  Examination  using  verbiage  outlined  in  Attachment  4.2.  (T-2)    Prepare customs paperwork using appropriate organizational letterhead. (T-2) 4.14.3.  The  Aircraft  Commander  will  request  US  customs  and  agriculture  quarantine inspectors  accept  a  waiver  for  boarding  and  examination  of  aircraft  based  on  the  cargo classification (T-2) 4.14.3.1.  If  the  waiver  is  denied  and  the  aircraft  is  at  an  en  route  location,  the  Aircraft Commander will request a “permit to proceed” to the final destination.  (T-1) 4.14.3.2.  If the waiver or “permit to proceed” is denied, the inspectors will comply with entry control guidance IAW DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108 and be escorted using a TPC  team.    (T-0)    Ensure  that  all  serial  numbers,  as  a  minimum,  are  covered  before letting  the  inspectors  board  to  get  a  full  customs  and  quarantine  clearance.    If  possible, cover all weapons completely. 4.14.4.  Do  not  allow  foreign  customs  or  other  local  government  officials  on  board  the aircraft.  If they insist on boarding, refuse entry in the most diplomatic, but positive manner.  Situation depending, the Aircraft Commanders will contact the Base Commander (if on a US military base) or the Air Attaché (if on a non-US base) and request assistance.  In all cases, notify CCC as soon as possible. (T-1) 4.14.5.  When  filing  a  flight  plan  to  a  base  that  does  not  have  customs  or  agriculture quarantine  inspectors  readily  available,  request  customs  and/or  agriculture  inspectors  meet the  aircraft  by  contacting  the  arrival  base  command  post/AMCC.    Determine  hours  of operations of customs facilities and comply with any requirements for advance notification.  In  a  divert  situation,  provide  as  much  lead-time  as  possible  to  arrange  for  customs  and agriculture inspectors. AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 47 4.15.  Crew  Rest  Procedures.  Before  entering  crew  rest  at  an  en  route  station,  the  Aircraft Commander  will  ensure  the  aircraft  is  sealed  (when  required)  and  a  sequence  of  events  is distributed  to  appropriate  support  agencies  for  follow-on  operations.  (T-2)    Reference Attachment  4.3  and  4.4.    Provide  command  post  and  618  AOC  (TACC)  contact  information during crew rest in the event of an emergency. 4.16.  Itinerary Deviation. 4.16.1.  As  soon  it  is  determined  a  mission  will  deviate  from  the  published  itinerary,  the Aircraft  Commander  will  notify  CCC  and  provide  updated  ETA’s  for  remaining  en  route stations  on  that  day’s  itinerary.  (T-1)  CCC  will  immediately  notify  destination  points  of contact  and  appropriate  diplomatic  clearance  authorities  by  telephone  and  provide  updated information.  (T-2)    Passing  timely  and  accurate  information  to  affected  destinations  is extremely important to mission accomplishment.. 4.16.2.  If  a  mission  deviates  by  two  or  more  hours  from  last  published  itinerary,  the  CCC will coordinate with  the  Aircraft Commander  and XOOOD to  disseminate a Mission  Setup Change  Message  (Attachment  3).  (T-2)    Using  secure  communications,  the  CCC  will transmit the updated information to the following agencies (at a minimum):  identified POCs at  bases  scheduled  to  be  transited,  pre-coordinated  emergency  divert  locations,  tanker  units (if applicable), appropriate en route and C2 agencies, any agency with a need to know. (T-2)  The Aircraft Commander will delay departure until CCC receives positive confirmation from affected stations remaining on the mission itinerary.  If the aircrew coordinates and changes directly with the shipper or receiver, advise CCC. 4.16.3.  Mission Change Message: 4.16.3.1.  618  AOC  (TACC)  will  coordinate  the  Mission  Change  Messages  with  the Aircraft  Commander.  (T-2)    If  necessary,  CCC  may  adjust  ground  times  to  return  a mission to its original itinerary.  Do not sacrifice proper crew rest to return to the original schedule.    However,  CCC  should  do  not  perpetuate  small  delays  by  using  originally planned ground times if less time provides adequate crew rest. 4.16.3.2.  The Aircraft Commander will relay revised information to CCC. (T-2)  CCC is responsible  for  checking  times  for  conflicts  with  other  missions,  notifying  the  pre-coordinated divert location, tanker unit (if applicable), appropriate en route agencies, and remaining  bases.    The  mission  planning  section  will  draft  and  send  any  message  traffic required.  (T-2)    The  Aircraft  Commander,  CCC,  and  associated  agencies  will  take appropriate  measures  to  ensure  classified  information  is  not  compromised  when communicating mission updates. 4.16.3.3.  The  CCC  should  reference  Attachment  3  of  this  regulation  when  developing changes  to  the  Mission  Setup  Message.    At  the  outset  of  each  message  change,  CCC should  briefly  and  clearly  identify  the  major  changes  contained  within.  CCC  should classify  changes  to  the  Mission  Setup  Message  consistent  with  the  original  message, IAW  SWOG  guidance,  or  as  required.    CCC  should  incorporate  hazardous  cargo information  if  changed  from  the  previous  Setup  Message.    Changes  to  diplomatic overflight information will normally be directed by the SWOG or contained in applicable Letters-of-Agreement (LOA). 48 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 4.16.3.4.  Include  all  addressees  in  the  Mission  Setup  Message  including  the  aircrew’s current location, divert locations, and remaining bases.  Omit stations already transited. 4.16.4.  Unscheduled  Hot  RON.    Mission  delays  may  force  the  aircrew  to  execute  an unscheduled  Hot  RON.    If  it  becomes  apparent  the  crew  is  unable  to  proceed  to  the  next destination  and/or  unable  to  complete  the  offload  within  remaining  CDT,  the  Aircraft Commander will immediately contact the CCC and request authority for either: (T-1) 4.16.4.1.  An extension to crew duty day. 4.16.4.2.  Permission to offload cargo and attempt the mission at a later time. 4.16.4.3.  Permission  to  Hot  RON  at  current  location,  emergency  divert  location,  or destination  airfield.    The  Aircraft  Commander  will  not  proceed  to  destination  if  the mission  is  estimated  to  arrive  without  sufficient  time  to  complete  offload  (if  one  is planned)  unless  destination  base  has  confirmed  through  CCC  they  can  support  the  Hot RON.  At USAFE bases, USAFE/A3/10 approval is required for a Hot RON. (T-1)  CCC will coordinate Hot RON requests through USAFE/A3/10NM. (T-1) AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 49 Chapter 5 SECURITY 5.1.  General.  Security standards for nuclear cargo, aircraft sanitization, EALs, and emergency security actions are listed in DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108.  Security standards for PL 1, 2, and 3 area entry control, marking, and security requirements are located in AFI 31-101. 5.2.  Threat  and  Vulnerability.  When  nuclear  cargo  is  outside  secure  storage  areas,  it  is susceptible  to  accidental  damage  and  terrorist  attack.    Personnel  should  take  every  action  to reduce the time nuclear cargo spends outside a secure storage area. 5.3.  Types  of  Security.  The  degree  of  security  protection  varies  according  to  the  cargo identified  for  transport.    DoD  security  requirements  are  broken  into  two  categories:    Type  I security and Type II security.  Refer to DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108 for a full description of Type I and Type II security requirements.  Refer to AFI 31-101 for a full description of PL 1, 2, and 3 security.  Note:  When discussing security requirements with another service, a detailed description may be necessary. 5.4.  Protection  Standards.  Nuclear  cargo  requires  Type  I  security.    Aircrew  will  ensure security meets DoD and Air Force standards when transporting nuclear cargo. (T-0) 5.5.  Type  I  Exclusion  Area  Procedures.  Entry  into  an  area  containing  nuclear  cargo  will  be controlled IAW DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN31-108 (T-0).  Aircrew will comply with following guidance regarding exclusion areas procedures: 5.5.1.  Type I Entry Control and Authority.  All personnel requiring entry into the exclusion area will be on an EAL IAW DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108. (T-0)  To enhance control and  limit  access  to  the  area,  commanders  will  ensure  EALs  list  the  minimum  number  of personnel required for mission accomplishment. (T-2)  The Courier will ensure all EALs are retrieved from the entry controller prior to aircraft departure. (T-2) 5.5.2.  During planned nuclear logistics movements, personnel and vehicles requesting entry into  the  exclusion  area  will  be  processed  by  security  personnel  prior  to  aircraft  arrival  and placed into a sanitized/secure holding area. (T-0) This process streamlines ground times and allows the Courier to quickly validate personnel and equipment requiring access to the area. 5.5.3.  Every  effort  should  be  made  to  streamline  operations  but  not  at  the  cost  of  surety.  Emphasis is on safety, surety, efficient ground times, and minimal exposure of nuclear cargo. 5.5.4.  Convoy Arrival at Aircraft.  The Aircraft Commander will ensure the aircrew is ready to conduct loading operations as soon as the convoy arrives. (T-2)  The Courier will ensure the  exclusion  area  is  large  enough  to  accommodate  the  safe  maneuvering  of  vehicles transporting nuclear cargo. (T-2) 5.5.5.  Exclusion area procedures will comply with DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108, Vol 3  (T-0)    No  person  shall  raise,  lower,  or  change  any  part  of  the  exclusion  area  without explicit  coordination  and  approval  from  the  Courier  officer  and  designated  host  security forces representative. (T-0) 5.5.6.  Contraband  is  defined  in  DoD  S-5210.41-M_AFMAN  31-108.    PNAF  aircrews transporting  nuclear  cargo  are  authorized  government  issued  and  personal  cell  phones, 50 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 computers, other electronics devices, and other general cargo.  Aircrew should minimize the number of devices used to accomplish the mission and will comply with AFMAN 91-201 or specific Nuclear Certification Impact Statement requirements. (T-2)  The Courier remains the ultimate authority for all equipment  allowed to  be in  the exclusion  area.  Commanders will ensure government and personal electronic devices meet the following requirements: (T-1) 5.5.6.1.  Government  issued  cell  phones,  computers,  and  other  electronic  devices assigned  to  C-17  aircrew  are  authorized  for  use  on  board  the  aircraft  if  the  systems perform a unique, mission-essential function.  However, if a system performs a backup or redundant function, it should not be used unless the primary system(s) are not functioning properly.  If not required for mission accomplishment, Aircraft Commanders will ensure the  equipment  is  turned  off,  battery  removed  (if  possible),  and  remains  stowed  when nuclear cargo is on board the aircraft. (T-1) 5.5.6.2.  Personal  cell  phones,  computers,  and  other  electronic  devices  carried  by  C-17 aircrew  are  authorized  for  use  on  board  the  aircraft  if  the  government  issued  electronic equipment  is  not  functioning.    If  not  required  for  mission  accomplishment,  the  Aircraft Commander  will  ensure  the  equipment  is  turned  off,  battery  removed  (if  possible),  and stowed when nuclear cargo is on board. (T-1)  If the battery cannot be removed, Aircraft Commanders  will  ensure  the  item  is  placed  in  an  approved  Radio  Frequency  Shielded Bag and stowed. (T-1) 5.6.  Sanitized  Aircraft.  Sanitize  aircraft  before  carrying  nuclear  cargo  at  the  most  logical station,  normally  at  the  first  onload  location.    Sanitization  can  also  be  accomplished  at  an  en route station  when several  stops are made before onloading nuclear  cargo.  When approved by the  Aircraft  Commander  and  Courier  officer  and  coordinated  with  host  base,  Type  II  security may  be  dropped  for  an  empty  aircraft  during  RON.    When  the  aircraft  is  defined  as  a  PL3 resource,  host  base  Security  forces  will  provide  random  checks  on  the  aircraft.  (T-0)    Before loading  nuclear  cargo,  the  Courier  will  ensure  the  aircraft  is  sanitized,  a  restricted  area established, and Type I security provided. (T-0) 5.6.1.  Sanitization  Procedures.    Aircrews  will  conduct  a  thorough  visual  inspection  and appropriate  aircraft  dash-1  preflight  or  through-flight  inspection  to  search  for  explosives, suspicious devices or packages, or unauthorized persons. (T-0)  When available, an explosive detection  dog  (EDD)  or  portable  explosive  detection  devices  will  be  used  to  sanitize  the aircraft  and  crew  baggage.    Do  not  delay  the  mission  if  an  EDD  is  not  available.    If  a suspicious device or explosives are found during the aircrew search, cordon off the area and request  support  from  the  nearest  military  EOD  unit.    During  periods  of  inclement  weather, crew bags may be sanitized on board the aircraft. 5.6.2.  If an alternate aircraft is required to complete a mission transporting nuclear cargo, the Courier will ensure the new aircraft is sanitized. (T-0) 5.6.3.  Providing  Type  II  security  on  a  sanitized  aircraft  maintains  the  sanitization,  and precludes  the  need  to  re-sanitize  before  loading  nuclear  cargo.    Note:    Consider  removing Type II security if extended servicing or maintenance is required.  If Type II requirements are removed at any time, re-sanitize the aircraft before onloading nuclear cargo. (T-0) 5.6.3.1.  The Courier will seal sanitized aircraft when the aircrew is not present. (T-0) AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 51 5.6.3.2.  Type II security will be maintained for sanitized aircraft (not required if aircraft is parked in a designated "PL1" restricted area) e.g., an AFGSC alert area. (T-0) 5.6.3.3.  Only the aircrew (not including the crew chief) are authorized unescorted access to the aircraft. (T-0) 5.6.3.4.  The  Courier  will  inform  Security  personnel  if  Type  II  security  material  is  on board the aircraft. (T-2)  Note:  The aircrew should not request security support merely to guard the Nuclear Mission Kit or classified mission material. 5.7.  Emergency  Diverts  of  Nuclear-Laden  Aircraft.  CONUS  and  OCONUS  bases  should handle  emergency  diverts  using  support  plan  (SPLAN)  procedures  for  receiving  nuclear-laden aircraft.  The pre-coordinated emergency divert location will maintain standby forces to receive nuclear-laden aircraft IAW an SPLAN that complies with current DoD and Air Force guidance. (T-0) 5.8.  Sealing  Aircraft.  Under  normal  conditions,  the  Aircraft  Commander  should  consider sealing nuclear mission aircraft during crew rests and extended en route delays.  During RONs at normal  AMC  maintenance  airfields,  sealing  is  at  the  discretion  of  the  Aircraft  Commander.    If sealing for security purposes, an SF representative should verify seal numbers when the aircraft is  sealed  and  re-opened.    If  sealing  for  maintenance  or  non-security  purposes,  the  Aircraft Commander  should  make  every  effort  to  comply  with  host  base  security  procedures.    As  a minimum, two aircrew members should verify all seals and record the seal number. (T-1)  Each time the aircrew or other authorized persons enter the aircraft, the Courier will ensure the aircraft is resealed before departing. (T-1)  Reference DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108 for additional sanitization procedures/requirements. 5.8.1.  Before  the  aircraft  is  sealed,  aircrew  will  tape  interior  emergency  escape  hatches, paratroop  doors,  maintenance/ditching  hatches,  etc.,  to  provide  evidence  of  forced  or unauthorized  entry  (T-2).    The  aircrew  will  also  ensure  the  crew  entrance  door(s)  and  any under floor access are closed and sealed using a serialized security seal.  (T-2) 5.8.2.  After  the  crew  door  is  sealed,  the  Courier  will  ensure  the  area  is  wiped  clean.  (T-2)  The Courier will  provide the seal number to SF and command post. (T-2) 5.8.3.  Before opening  a  sealed  aircraft, the Courier or designated representative will verify the  seal  number  and  inspect  seals  inside  the  aircraft  according  to  DoD  S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108. (T-0) 5.8.4.  In  the  event  of  forced  entry  or  evidence  aircraft  seals  have  been  tampered  with,  the Aircraft Commander/Courier should take the following actions: 5.8.4.1.  Ensure all evidence remains untouched. (T-0) 5.8.4.2.  When the aircraft is  empty, the  Aircraft  Commander will report the incident  to base  command  post  who  will  notify  SF,  EOD,  and  the  Office  of  Special  Investigations (OSI). (T-1) The Aircraft Commander should request an immediate investigation. (T-1) 5.8.4.3.  When nuclear cargo is on board, Aircraft Commanders will report the incident to base  command  post  who  will  notify  SF,  EOD,  and  the  Office  of  Special  Investigations (OSI). (T-1)  The aircrew will assume the weapon has been tampered with and comply with  procedures  outlined  in  DoDM  3150.08,  Nuclear  Weapon  Accident  Response Procedures  (NARP),  DoDI  3150.10,  DoD  Response  to  U.S.  Nuclear  Weapon  Incidents, 52 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 and  AFI  10-2501,  Air  Force  Emergency  Management  Program.  (T-0)    The  Aircraft Commander should request an immediate investigation. (T-0) 5.8.4.4.  After  investigation  is  complete  and  aircraft  is  released  by  EOD  and  security forces, perform a thorough preflight and send appropriate reports IAW AFMAN 91-221. 5.9.  Security  Acknowledgment  Letter.  Security  acknowledgment  letters  are  a  means  of transferring  security  responsibility  to  host  base  security  forces.    Couriers  may  use  the  letter  in Attachment 4.4. after determining security requirements while the crew is not at the aircraft. 5.10.  Security Briefing Worksheet.  Tasked locations identified in the Mission Setup Message (Primary and Divert locations) will develop and coordinate a security briefing (AF Form 527A) with the Aircrew Courier.  (T-2)  Host base SF units will coordinate with AFOSI (as applicable) to  obtain  local  threat  assessment  information  for  events  that  may  impact  the  tasked  mission.  Security briefings will include a unique Date Time Group (DTG) and may only be distributed via secure means.  IAW AFI 21-203, all coordination will be completed NLT two duty days prior to home-station mission departure. AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 53 Chapter 6 CUSTODY TRANSFER PROCEDURES 6.1.  General.

This  Chapter  describes  procedures  for  reporting  and  solving  problems encountered  on  nuclear  airlift  missions  and  for  identifying  outstanding  host  base  support  to nuclear airlift missions. 9.2.  Special  Assignment  Airlift  Mission  Report  (SAAMREP).  This report is used to correct deficiencies  in  equipment,  procedures,  or  support.    It  is  a  way  to  monitor,  evaluate,  and continually improve operational policies and procedures.  The Aircraft Commander may submit a  report  on  a  mission,  or  the  squadron/unit  nuclear  airlift  monitor  may  submit  a  report  when multiple missions encounter the same problem. 9.2.1.  SAAMREPs  should  not  be  used  in  place  of  other  reports  (e.g.,  hazard  reports,  Dull Sword/OPREP-3 reports, material deficiency reports) or command operational reports, such as AMC Form 43, AMC Transient Aircrew Facilities Comment, or AMC Form 54, Aircraft Commander's Report on Services/Facilities. 9.2.2.  PNAF units will ensure SAAMREPs are prepared IAW the message format illustrated in Attachment 5.1. (T-2)  SAAMREPS should include enough details to identify deficiencies and  clearly  indicate  problem  areas.    As  a  minimum,  SAMREPs  should  include  names, organizations, dates, times, and locations that pertain to the suspected deficiency.  The report should  be  written  with  sufficient  detail  to  stand alone  and  include  a  statement  in  the  report that the OSC was informed of the problem.  PNAF units should separate reports by problem area and location to assist in timely resolution.  When a SAAMREP is the result of multiple missions  encountering  the  same  problem,  the  report  should  indicate  who  at  the  identified location was informed of the problem. 9.2.3.  PNAF units will classify SAAMREPs if necessary. (T-0) 9.2.4.  Report Processing: 9.2.4.1.  The squadron/unit NAM will ensure reports are prepared IAW Paragraph 9.2.2. (T-2)  Significant problems that are resolved on the spot through aircrew involvement or at squadron/unit level may be submitted as reports “FOR DOCUMENTATION ONLY.”  In  these  cases,  label  the  report  “FOR  DOCUMENTATION  ONLY,”  assign  it  a  unit number, and file it with  other SAAMREPs.  Send a copy of the report to AMC/A3N to facilitate MAJCOM monitoring of the entire PNAF. 9.2.4.2.  The  squadron/unit  commander  must  endorse reports  generated  “FOR DOCUMENTATION  ONLY”  and  submit  to  the  parent  Wing  and  MAJCOM.  (T-2)  Information  addressees  on  up-channeled  reports  include:  AMC/A3N,  618  AOC (TACC)/XOOOD,  AMC/SEW,  the  parent  wing  NSM,  SEW,  and  PNAF  squadron/unit.  The commander or operations officer of the base where the problem occurred must be an information addressee on report. (T-2) 9.2.4.3.  The  wing  Nuclear  Surety  Manager  reviews  the  report  and  determines  Wing Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). 66 AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 9.2.4.4.  Within  14  days  of  mission  completion,  the  squadron/unit  NAM  will  submit reports  to  AMC/A3N  for  MAJCOM  review.  (T-2)    If  follow-on  action  is  required, AMC/A3N will take responsibility for the initial report and notify subordinate levels. 9.2.5.  Each level should act on reported problems within 5 duty days from receipt.  Include all previously addressed information addressees on correspondence related to the problem. 9.2.6.  For  documentation  purposes,  Commanders  or  responsible  agencies  at  all  levels  will maintain a SAAMREP log or file and indicate the date received, the agency the report was sent to and date, and brief comments about its status. (T-2) 9.2.7.  Completed  SAAMREPs  should  be  submitted  to  HQ  AMC/A3N with  all  other  levels includes as information addressees (refer to Attachment 5.2).  If AMC/A3N is the final action agency, send the response to the initiating squadron/unit, with all other levels as information addressees.  AMC/A3N will forward the completed SAAMREP to AMC/SEW and 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD  for  review  of  recommended  actions.    AMC/SEW  will  determine  if  the report should be forwarded to the AMC Nuclear Surety and Operations Council (NSOC) for command level oversight of recommended actions. 9.2.8.  The  squadron/unit  NAM  is  responsible  for  monitoring  the  SAAMREP  coordination process and updating the individual who submitted the report on the final resolution. (T-2) 9.2.9.  The  squadron/unit  NAM    will  maintain  SAAMREPs  for  2-years  from  the  month  of close-out. (T-2) 9.2.10.  The  squadron/unit  NAM  should  maintain  mission  debrief  records  and  "FOR DOCUMENTATION ONLY" reports on file so the unit can effectively determine if a recent problem was not an isolated incident and warrants a separate SAAMREP. 9.3.  AF  Form  527F,  Checklist  for  Nuclear  Mission  Support.  To  recognize  outstanding  host base  supports  of  nuclear  airlift  missions,  PNAF  units  should  submit  AF  Form  527Fs  to AMC/SEW  for  consideration.    AMC/SEW  awards  the  Annual  Nuclear  Surety  Certificate  of Appreciation. 9.3.1.  The Aircraft Commander or designated unit representative should complete AF Form 527F covering each DoD installation that supports his or her aircraft while carrying nuclear and nuclear-related cargo. 9.3.2.  The  Aircraft  Commander  or  designated  unit  representative  should  not  use  AF  Form 527F in lieu of the SAAMREP or other reports to identify and solve problems. 9.3.3.  The  Aircraft  Commander  or  designated  unit  representative  will  classify  AF  Form 527F  according  to  Mission  Setup  Message  only  if  the  base  being  rated  is  not  on  the numerical  listing  of  bases  published  by  AMC/A3N.  (T-0)  When  using  the  numerical designation for base location, be sure the narrative does not contain classified information. 9.3.4.  If possible, provide a copy of AF Form 576F to the OSC.  Do not include location or numerical listing on that copy. 9.3.5.  Squadron/unit  NAM  will  provide  copies  of  the  AF  Form  527F  to  AMC/SEW  and A3N within 14 days of mission completion. (T-2) AFI13-526V1  30 AUGUST 2016 67 Chapter 10 REPORTING NUCLEAR MISHAPS 10.1.  General.  Aircrews  are  responsible  for  initiating  mishap  reports  should  a  mishap  occur involving  nuclear  and  nuclear-related  cargo  in  their  custody.    Reportable  events  involving nuclear cargo range from a condition that could degrade nuclear safety to the loss or destruction of  nuclear  cargo.    These  events  require  a  report  IAW  AFMAN  91-221,  Weapons  Safety Investigations  and  Reports  and  are  categorized  as  nuclear  accidents,  incidents,  or  deficiencies (AID).
