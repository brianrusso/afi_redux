This publication implements Air Force Instruction 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.  This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive core-training document.  It identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources and minimum core task requirements for the Security Forces (SF) specialty.  This CFETP provides all SF personnel [active duty, reserve and Air National Guard (ANG)] a clear career path to success. 2.  This CFETP consists of two parts; both parts of the plan assist supervisors in planning, managing and controlling training within the career field. 2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan.  Section B identifies career field path progression information, duties and responsibilities and training strategies.  Section C associates each skill level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, training, education, experience and other).  Section D indicates resource constraints (for example; funds, manpower, equipment and facilities). 2.2.  Part II includes the following:  Section A contains the Specialty Training Standard(s) supervisors will use to certify training.  Section B course objective list/training standards (Not Used).  Section C identifies available support materials provided by Air Force Handbooks (AFHs), Security Forces Training Reference Guides (SFTRG) and electronic Tactics, Techniques and Procedures Guides (e-TTPG).  Section D identifies where supervisors can find and determine resources available to support training, including both mandatory and optional courses.  Section E is reserved to identify major command (MAJCOM) unique training requirements.  Unit level supervisors and trainers use Part II to identify, plan and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  The core  Specialty Training Standard (STS) for AFSC 3P0X1, Appendix A; Military Working Dog STS (AFSC 3P0X1A) Appendix B; and Combat Arms (AFSC 3P0X1B) Appendix C, identify the duties, tasks and technical references required to support unit training; establish Air Education and Training Command (AETC) training requirements; identify core/wartime tasks; and identify correspondence course requirements. 3.  CFETP guidance ensures individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their careers.  This plan will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.  At the unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. 1        ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS    EXPLAINED Advanced Training (AT).

Purpose.  Career field managers, commanders, training managers, supervisors, trainers and the training wing use this CFETP to plan, develop, manage and conduct an effective career field training program.  This plan outlines the training individuals in AFSC 3P0X1/A/B must receive to develop and progress throughout their careers.  It identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and continuation training requirements.  Initial skills training is the  AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force, retraining into this specialty or lateral training into either the A or B shred-out.  AETC provides this training at Lackland AFB TX for AFSC 3P0X1/A/B. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, CDCs and exportable training courses required for award of the 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task    performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It provides the performance skills/knowledge training required to do the job.  The CFETP also serves the following purposes: 1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct and evaluate a career field training program.  It also helps supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career. 1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in these specialties and recommends training/education throughout each phase of an individual's career. 1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training and the training delivery method. 1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints which impact implementation of desired career field training program. 2.  Use.  MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs) and supervisors at all levels will use this plan to develop comprehensive and cohesive training programs for each individual in these specialties. 2.1.  AETC training personnel develop/revise formal resident and exportable training based on requirements established by users and documented in Part II of this CFETP.  They will also work with the Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM) to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  The MFMs will ensure MAJCOM training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial skills and upgrade requirements.  OJT, resident training, contract training or exportable courseware/courses satisfy identified requirements.  MAJCOMs must identify MAJCOM developed training to support this AFS for inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate training already available. 2.3.  Headquarters, Air Force Security Forces Center (HQ AFSFC) develops publications on specific SF subjects, procedures or equipment.  MAJCOMs or local units select and localize these publications to fit their needs. 3.  Coordination and Approval.  HQ AF/A4SX and HQ AFSFC/FGT develops this CFETP.  The approval authority is AF/A7SM, the AFCFM.  MFMs and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training  requirements.  The AETC Training Pipeline Manager will initiate an annual review of this document by the AFCFM,  AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy. 4            SECTION B - CAREER FIELD PROGRESSION AND INFORMATION Specialty Description.

SECTION D – RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS There are currently no resource constraints.  This area is reserved. SECTION E – TRANSITION TRAINING GUIDE There are currently no transition training requirements.  This area is reserved. 16        PART II SECTION A - SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD (STS) 1.  Implementation.  These STSs will be used for technical training provided by AETC. 2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, the STS at appendices A (Core STS), B (MWD STS) and C (Combat Arms): 2.1.  Lists the most common tasks, knowledge and technical references (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level in column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference). 2.2.  Specialty-wide Core and Wartime Tasks.  The tasks identified in column 2 indicate core tasks by skill level, for the specialty.  As a minimum, trainees must complete applicable core tasks for skill level upgrade as indicated by the skill level annotated in column 2.  If units encounter situations where training constraints exist (for example, lack of equipment, training areas, etc.), specific waiver action must be submitted through their MAJCOM functional  manager, to the AFCFM (AF/A7SM) and if approved, documented in unit and individual training records. MAJCOMs determine the method to record training constraint waivers for their subordinate units.  Wartime tasks are              those tasks that must be taught when courses are accelerated in a wartime environment and are identified in the column on the far left of the STS by an asterisk (*).  In response to a wartime environment, only tasks identified with an asterisk in this column will be taught in the SF Apprentice Course. 2.3.  Provides certification for OJT.  Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements. 2.4.  Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements.  Column 4 shows the proficiency to be demonstrated by the graduate upon completion of the resident and correspondence courses. 2.5.  Qualitative requirements.  A proficiency code key is used in each STS to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses. 2.6.  Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201.  Use the core STS (Appendix A) for all SF personnel.  In addition, use the Military Working Dog Handler and Combat Arms STS (Appendices B and C respectively) for personnel awarded the appropriate shred or other SF personnel who are performing duties (in a limited capacity) in those areas.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply: 3.  Documentation.  Document and certify completion of training using the electronic Air Force Training Record (AFTR).  Identify duty position requirements for every duty position within a unit or organization.  As a minimum, complete the following areas of the JQS:  Training Start, Training Complete, Trainee Initials, and Trainer Initials. 3.1.  Transcribing from old CFETP.  Use only the STS from the new CFETP to identify and certify all past and current qualifications.  For those tasks previously certified and required in the current duty position, evaluate current qualifications and when verified, recertify using the current date as the completion date and enter trainee’s and supervisor’s initials (no training is taking place).  When transcribing previous certification for tasks not required in the current duty position, carry forward only the previous completion dates of certification.  If and when transcribed    tasks become duty position requirements, recertify using standard certification procedures.  The person whose initials appear in the trainer block during the transcription process must meet the requirements of their role. 3.2.  Decertification and Recertification.  When an Airman is found to be unqualified on a previously certified duty position task, the supervisor deletes the previous certification.  Appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form 623A, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, as to the reason for decertification.  The supervisor will initiate retraining on this task by entering a new training start date.  Once the retraining is complete, enter a new training complete date and both the trainer and trainee must enter their initials. 4.  Training Standard.  Tasks are trained to the “go/no go” level.  “Go” means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy, timeliness and correct use of procedures. 17               5.  Promotion Testing.  The core STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  Do not use the Military Working Dog Handler or Combat Arms STS.  Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  All SF personnel will be tested on core SF skills only, regardless of duty position.  Core SF personnel who retrain into one of the shreds ARE NOT exempt from taking the SKT.  Develop only one test for each grade.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog.  Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment in the United               States Air Force.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve. 6.  Report unsatisfactory performance of individual course graduates to 37 TRG/DOS, Lackland AFB, TX, using AF Form 1284, Training Quality Report (TQR).  Please reference specific STS paragraphs.  Additionally, a customer service information line has been installed for the supervisors’ convenience.  For a quick response to problems, call the Customer Service Information Line, DSN 473-2917, anytime day or night. Section B – Course Objective List. Section B, not used.  This area is reserved. Section C – Support Material. OJT Support materials consist of Air Force publications (AFI, AFMANs, AFHs), SF Training Reference Guides, Army Field Manuals, Technical Orders (T.O.) and TTP Guides.  These documents contain comprehensive information on SF subjects, procedures or equipment.  Use these publications for qualification or sustainment training, or skills/knowledge enhancement.
