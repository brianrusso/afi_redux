Purpose.  The purpose of this instruction is to provide USAF guidance and direction on the education and training of Airmen conducting air advising activities and operations  with partner nations. 1.2.  General.  The core mission of the air advisor is to impart professional aviation knowledge and skills to foreign security forces (FSF) in order to improve their airpower capabilities to meet both  U.S.  and  partner  nation  objectives.    Air  advising  consists  of  the  following  five  basic activities:  assessing, training, advising, assisting, and equipping.  Additional information about air  advisors  can  be  found  in  AFI  10-4201,  Volume  3  (V3),  Air  Advising  Operations  and  Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-4.5, Air Advising. 1.2.1.  The  USAF  organizes,  trains,  and  equips  Airmen  to  conduct  air  advising  activities  in support  of  combatant  commander  (CCDR)  theater  campaign  plans  (TCPs)  and  global campaign  plans,  commander  Air  Force  Forces  (COMAFFOR)  campaign  support  plans (CSPs), and associated security cooperation country plans to  execute missions governed by Titles 10 and 22 of the U.S. Code. 1.2.1.1.  Security  Cooperation  (SC)-related  activities  and  missions  executed  by  air advisors include, but are not limited to, security assistance (SA), security force assistance (SFA),  security  sector  assistance  (SSA),  foreign  internal  defense  (FID),  building partnerships  (BP),  building  partner  capacity  (BPC),  building  partner  aviation  capacity (BPAC), aviation  enterprise development  (AED), and other engagements as directed by appropriate facilitate  humanitarian assistance/disaster  relief  (HA/DR),  counter  drug  (CD),  counter  transnational  organized crime  (CTOC),  counterterrorism  (CT),  stability  operations,  and  other  irregular  warfare (IW) activities. efforts  help advising authorities.   Air 1.2.2.  Air advisor education and training provides Airmen with a foundational capability to successfully  engage  with  FSF  counterparts  inside  a  partner  nation.    It  emphasizes  the  right mix  of  language,  regional  expertise,  and  culture  IAW  AFI  36-4001,  Air  Force  Language, Region,  and  Culture  Program.    It  also  develops  air  advisor  core  knowledge  and  skills,  and required  fieldcraft/force  protection  skills  to  plan,  execute,  and  assess  SC-related  missions across the range of military operations in support of U.S. national interests. 1.2.3.  Air advisor education and training programs develop and maintain different levels of proficiency  for  effective  air  advisor  employment.    Air  advisor  education  and  training  is tailored to provide Airmen the necessary knowledge and skills to perform their duties in any operating environment (i.e., permissive, uncertain, and hostile environments). 1.2.4.  Air  advisor  education  and  training  programs  ensure  Airmen  assigned  to  conduct  air advisor duties obtain and maintain requisite training.  These programs: 1.2.4.1.  Support  pre-deployment  training  for  Airmen  tasked  through  the  Global  Force Management process to fill recurring and emergent mission taskings supporting CCDR. AFI10-4201V1  25 JUNE 2015   5  1.2.4.2.  Support  mission-ready  training  for  designated  air  advisor  forces/units  that execute SC missions in support of CCDR objectives. 1.2.4.3.  Support Airmen tasked to conduct other SC missions and activities as required. 1.2.5.  Documents  associated  with the  Graduate  Program Requirements Document (GPRD), which addresses student production for courses sponsored by  Air  Education  and  Training  Command  (AETC),  and  the  Air  Advisor  Education  and Training Program Guidance Letter (PGL), which prioritizes student production. instruction this include 1.2.5.1.  SOF students attending AETC-sponsored courses are included in the GPRD. 1.2.5.2.  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Command  (AFSOC)  determines  student production at AFSOC education and training venues. 1.2.5.3.  The  Education  and  Training  Course  Announcements  (ETCA)  website  at https://etca.randolph.af.mil  provides  general  information  on  General  Purpose  Force (GPF) air advisor and combat aviation advisor (CAA) courses and locations. 1.3.  Key  Definitions  and  Terms.  Attachment  1  contains  a  glossary  of  references  and supporting information, to include  abbreviations,  acronyms,  and terms used in  this publication.  This  document  does  not  include  a  complete  list  of  multi-Service  and  USAF  brevity  terms  and acronyms that may be applicable to air advisors. 1.3.1.  Air Advisor:  An Airman specially trained and educated to apply aviation support and operational  expertise  to  assess,  train,  advise,  assist,  and  equip  partner  nations  in  the development, sustainment, and employment of their aviation enterprise to meet their national security needs, in support of U.S. interests.  This includes both GPF and Special Operations Forces (SOF) personnel. 1.3.2.  Designated  Air  Advisor  Forces/Units:    Those  forces  and/or  units  with  air  advising designed  operational  capability  (DOC)  statements  and  mission  essential  tasks  (MET).  Designated air  advisor forces/units  have readiness requirements for personnel, training,  and equipment,  if  applicable,  and  report  those  requirements  in  status  of  resources  and  training system (SORTS) and defense readiness reporting system (DRRS).  Personnel assigned to the air  advising  mission  in  designated  forces/units  are  required  to  accomplish  air  advisor education  and  training  at  the  Advanced  or  Basic  level  prior  to  reporting  ready  for  the  air advisor mission. 1.3.2.1.  Designated air advisor forces/units that require the Advanced level of air advisor training  include  those  assigned  to  conduct  BPC/SFA  as  a  primary  mission  such  as Mobility  Support  Advisory  Squadrons  and  Contingency  Response  Group  air  advisor branches. 1.3.3.  Expeditionary  Air  Advisor  Forces:    Those  individuals,  teams,  or  units,  who  are  not aligned  with  an  air  advising  DOC  statements  or  MET.    Consequently,  expeditionary  air advisor forces have no specific readiness requirements for personnel, training, and equipment and do not report such requirements in SORTS and DRRS.  Expeditionary air advisor forces are required to accomplish air advisor education and training at the Advanced or Basic level to serve in an expeditionary air advisor capacity. 1.3.4.  Air Advising Augmentees:  Those forces, not defined as air advisors, but who support air advising activities.  Air advising augmentees require some level of training as determined   6  AFI10-4201V1  25 JUNE 2015 by  applicable  theater  requirements  and/or  the  supported  organization.    Note:    See  AFI  10-4201V3  paragraph  3.3.3.2.  for  minimum  training  requirements  for  an  air  advising  team composition. 1.3.5.  When using this instruction, the following terms apply: 1.3.5.1.  Must, will, or shall indicate a mandatory requirement. 1.3.5.2.  Should  is  normally  used  to  indicate  a  preferred  or  recommended  option  or method of accomplishment. 1.3.5.3.  May indicates an acceptable or satisfactory method or option. 1.3.5.4.  Note  indicates  operating  procedures,  techniques,  etc.,  which  are  considered necessary to emphasize. 1.4.  Scope.  This  instruction  prescribes  USAF  procedures  and  responsibilities  for  planning, scheduling, resourcing, managing, and executing air advisor education and training. 1.4.1.  This instruction governs all USAF air advisor education and training to meet mission-ready  requirements  for  Airmen  assigned  to  designated  and  expeditionary  air  advisor forces/units    and  those  selected  for  temporary  expeditionary  taskings.    The  portion  of  air advisor  education  and  training  developed  to  specifically  meet  GCC-mandated  pre-deployment  training  requirements  (e.g.,  force  protection/fieldcraft)  is  subject  to  USAF expeditionary skills training guidance and oversight. 1.4.2.  Aircrew  qualification  and  maintenance  certification  programs  for  USAF  personnel operating/maintaining non-USAF aircraft in support of SC are governed by applicable 11- or 21-series instructions and/or guidance by the governing authority.  MAJCOMs may develop guidance  addressing  the  air  advisor  education  and  training  for  aircrew  and  maintenance personnel. 1.5.  Applicability. 1.5.1.  The  policies  and  requirements  in  this  instruction  apply  to  all  Airmen  specifically assigned and/or tasked to perform duties as an air advisor in support of USAF SC missions, Airmen who support air advising activities, and USAF organizations conducting air advisor education and training. It also defines Headquarters (HQ) USAF and USAF major command (MAJCOM) authorities and responsibilities related to air advisor education and training. 1.5.2.  GPF,  SOF,  government  civilians,  and  contractors  pursuant  to  a  contractual relationship  may  serve  as  USAF  air  advisors.    Military  members  and  civil  servants overseeing  contractors  acting  as  air  advisors  must  assure  that  contractors  do  not  perform inherently governmental duties or engage in personal services as part of the air advisor duties performed. 1.5.2.1.  Contractors adhere to the requirements of the governing contract.  Every attempt shall be made to integrate the education and training requirements in this instruction and methods for funding these requirements into contracts for air advisors. 1.6.  Air Advisor Education and Training Course Guidance.  Airmen conducting air advising missions will be qualified at the minimum level required per unit MET or as a result of specific mission  task  requirements  (T-1).    Air  advisor  training  levels  are  defined  in  this  instruction  as either the Basic, Advanced, or CAA.  MAJCOMs conducting  air advisor education and training AFI10-4201V1  25 JUNE 2015   7  will  develop  syllabi  in  accordance  with  these  levels  and  the  education  and  training  standards specified  in  this  instruction.    MAJCOMs  possessing  designated  forces/units  will  establish  air advisor  continuation  training  requirements  and  may  supplement  pre-deployment  training requirements established in this instruction for their assigned forces (T-1). 1.6.1.  Airmen  requiring  air  advisor  education  and  training  may  complete  other  approved military  branch,  government  agency,  or  partner  nation  education  and  training  courses  that meet the requirements published in this instruction.  HQ AETC/A3Q serves as the approval authority for GPF seeking this option, and AFSOC serves in this capacity for SOF. 1.6.2.  GPF  education  and  training  enables  GPF  air  advisors  to  operate  independently  of, integrate with, or augment USAF SOF advisors. 1.6.3.  SOF  advisors  are  unique  in  that  they  generally  fill  SOF-specific  requirements  and operate in sensitive, austere environments under the control of the theater special operations command  (TSOC),  a  joint  special  operations  task  force,  or  another  SOF  command  and control element. 1.7.  Air Advisor Scheduling Priorities.  The annual Air Advisor Education and Training PGL provides  MAJCOMs  conducting  air  advisor  education  and  training  with  a  forecast  of requirements for the execution year to facilitate programming, scheduling, and allocation of air advisor courses.  It also serves as the means to determine funding levels. 1.7.1.  The  following  priority  levels  shall  be  used  to  determine  training  requirements  that emerge after the PGL has been determined: 1.7.1.1.  Priority 1:   Contingency operations for USAF, other services, U.S. government (USG), and contractor personnel who are acting as air advisors per CCDR direction.  A named operation like Operation ENDURING FREEDOM is an example of this category of education and training. 1.7.1.2.  Priority  2:    Designated  forces/units  whose  specific  mission  is  to  engage  with partner  nation  counterparts  in  support  of  SC  activities  that  are  linked  to  COMAFFOR CSPs or CCDR TCPs.  Examples of this category of education and training include: 1.7.1.2.1.  Air Force Special Operations Air Warfare Center (AFSOAWC). 1.7.1.2.2.  571st and 818th Mobility Support Advisory Squadrons (MSAS). 1.7.1.2.3.  Contingency  Response  Group/Contingency  Response  Forces  (CRG/CRF) air advisor branches. 1.7.1.2.4.  Inter-American  Air  Forces  Academy  (IAAFA)  instructors  serving  as  a designated  force  for  security  assistance  team  (SAT)/mobile  training  team  (MTT) augmentation. 1.7.1.2.5.  U.S. Air Forces Central Command Air Warfare Center (AAWC). 1.7.1.2.6.  Other USAF organizations identified as designated air advisor forces/units. 1.7.1.3.  Priority  3:    Expeditionary  air  advisors  whose  mission  includes  engaging  with partner  nation  counterparts  in  support  of  SC  activities.    Examples  include:    USAF personnel tasked to support offices of security cooperation in U.S. embassies and similar SC programs along with country-specific SC programs such as:   8  AFI10-4201V1  25 JUNE 2015 1.7.1.3.1.  USAF Afghanistan-Pakistan Hands (AFPAK Hands). 1.7.1.3.2.  Extended training service specialists (ETSSs). 1.7.1.3.3.  USAF  international  health  specialists  (IHS),  medical  embedded  training teams  (ETTs),  medical  MTTs,  and  other  health  professionals  tasked  to  perform  air advising activities. 1.7.1.3.4.  AFSOC aircrew, medical personnel, and other Service support personnel. 1.7.1.3.5.  National Guard State Partnership Program (SPP). 1.7.1.3.6.  820th Base Defense Group personnel supporting air advising activities. 1.7.1.3.7.  USAF SATs/MTTs or other SATs/MTTs supporting SC missions. 1.7.1.3.8.  Defense  Language  Institute  English  Learning  Center  (DLIELC),  Defense Institute for Medical Operations (DIMO), and  USAF School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) instructors tasked to deploy in an air advising capacity. 1.7.1.3.9.  C-MAJCOM/C-NAF staff members typically assigned to Air Force Forces A5I  and  A5X  divisions  and  expected  to  conduct  campaign  support  and  country planning and/or perform air advising activities. 1.7.1.4.  Priority  4:    Other  military  branches,  other  USG,  and  contractor  personnel  who are  deploying  in  an  aviation  or  aviation  support  capacity  to  conduct  SC/BP/SFA activities.    This  category  also  includes  partner  nation  personnel  performing  air  advisor duties. 1.7.1.5.  Priority 5:  All other government/Service personnel requiring SFA education and training  not  related  to  air  advisors  (e.g.,  U.S.  Army  personnel  in  country-specific  SC programs, such as AFPAK Hands). 1.7.1.6.  Priority  6:    U.S.  government  organizations  or  individuals  seeking  specific education and training, such as fieldcraft/force protection courses, to operate more safely and  effectively  in  an  unfamiliar  environment.    This  category  is  used  for  personnel  that, while not conducting an SC/BP/SFA mission, could benefit from courses offered at an air advising venue.  Examples include Airmen tasked to deploy to a hostile environment for duties not directly related to air advising. 1.7.2.  In  the  event  that  education  and  training  venue  capacity  cannot  accommodate  all customers within a given priority level, AF/A3O will adjudicate. 1.7.3.  The  MAJCOM  functional  manager  for  the  applicable  air  advisor  education  and training (i.e., HQ AETC/A3Q for GPF and AFSOC for SOF) approves out-of-cycle requests for  education  and  training  if  within  the  capacity  of  applicable  air  advisor  education  and training venues.  If requirements exceed capacity, the governing MAJCOM has the following options: 1.7.3.1.  Request  the  MAJCOM  requiring  out-of-cycle  training  provide  additional funding/resources to meet the requirement. 1.7.3.2.  Submit  an  estimate  of  the  resources  needed  to  meet  the  requirements  to AF/A3OM for consideration. AFI10-4201V1  25 JUNE 2015   9  1.7.3.3.  Grant an exemption/waiver as detailed in paragraph 1.7. 1.7.3.4.  When feasible, rearrange the air advisor education and training schedule or make other adjustments to accommodate the out-of-cycle request. 1.7.3.5.  Disapprove the request. 1.8.  Exemptions and Waivers. 1.8.1.  Unless specified or otherwise delegated elsewhere in this instruction, AF/A3OM is the waiver  authority  for  this  instruction.    IAW  AFI  33-360,  specific  waiver  authorities  are outlined  using  the  Tier  “(T-X)”  nomenclature  [e.g.,  “(T-0)”,  “(T-1)”,  etc.]  throughout  the instruction. 1.8.2.  Course Syllabus Waivers and Exemptions. 1.8.2.1.  Exemptions  may  be  granted  when  other  education  and  training  or  experience meets or exceeds a specific air advisor syllabus requirement or set of requirements. 1.8.2.2.  A  waiver  applies  when  the  appropriate  agency  authorizes,  on  a  case-by-case basis, a request to deviate from an approved syllabus or course requirement. 1.8.2.3.

Common Training Standards for SFA Missions. 3.1.1.  Common SFA Training Standards.  To meet DoD requirements for SFA training, the joint community has established recommended SFA training standards, codified in a standard list  of  knowledge,  skills,  abilities,  and  attitudes  (KSAAs),  that  consist  of:  (1)  individual-enabling tasks/skills; (2) collective-enabling tasks; and (3) developmental tasks. 3.1.1.1.  DoD Directive 5100.01, Functions of the Department of Defense and Its Major Components,  requires  the  Services  to  organize,  train,  and  equip  forces  to  contribute unique service capabilities to conduct SC and SFA activities. 3.1.1.2.  The  master  task  list  (MTL)  of  common  training  standards  for  SFA  enables  the Services to accurately identify, track, manage, and certify individuals who possess all or an  applicable/necessary  portion  of  the  SFA  individual,  collective,  and  developmental KSAAs. 3.1.2.  Air Advisor Education and Training Standards.  This instruction establishes levels of air advisor education and training consistent with applicable recommendations in the DoD’s Guidance  on  Common  Training  Standards  for  Security  Force  Assistance  and  includes additional USAF-specific air advisor training requirements.  These air advisor education and training  standards  provide  the  mechanism  by  which  the  USAF  meets  applicable  DoD  SFA training requirements. 3.2.  Air Advisor Education and Training Levels. 3.2.1.  USAF  air  advisors  are  trained  at  the  Basic,  Advanced,  and  CAA  levels.    See  Table 3.1.    Air  Advising  Education  and  Training  Levels,  for  further  description  of  each  training level. 3.2.1.1.  Basic Level.  The Basic air advisor education and training level is designed for Airmen tasked to conduct advising missions with limited scope, complexity, or duration in  a  permissive  environment.    An  Airman  may  be  tasked  to  perform  basic  air  advising activities in support of an expeditionary advisor team, as an augmentee to an advanced or SOF  advisor  team,  or  as  a  result  of  being  assigned  to  a  unit  with  a  BPC/SFA  MET  in addition to its primary mission. 3.2.1.1.1.  Regional experience and language capability are not essential to a Basic air advisor qualification.  However, due to mission requirements, personnel who possess regional  experience  or  language  capability  may  be  tasked  to  perform  basic  advisor duties when required. 3.2.1.2.  Advanced Level.  The Advanced air advisor education and training level enables Airmen  to  perform  duties  in  either  a  permissive,  uncertain,  or  hostile  environment.  Graduates  possess  in-depth  training  that  incorporates  additional  air  advisor  skills, language, regional expertise, culture, planning, assessment, and force protection/fieldcraft skills. These skills prepare an air advisor to develop a partner nation’s aviation enterprise and conduct more complex tasks, with a larger scope, on a more frequent basis, or for a AFI10-4201V1  25 JUNE 2015   15  long  duration.    Advanced  air  advisors  specialize  in  regional  expertise  and  culture  and maintain  language  proficiency  appropriate  to  their  operating  environment.    Unit commanders  will  ensure  air  advisors  have  an  appropriate  languge  capability  for  the mission assigned (T-2).  If an advisor is in a language coded billet the minimum Defense Language  Proficiency  Test  (DLPT)    score  should  be  no  lower  than  a  1/1.    The commander  will  base  language  requirements  upon  the  BP/BPC/SFA  Air  Advisor Operations  Mission  Essential  Task  (MET)  and  supported theater  requirements.  Advanced air advisors  are assigned to  designated forces/units  with  a primary  BPC/SFA MET (T-2). 3.2.1.3.  CAA level.  The CAA education and training level meets all SFA requirements and air advisor course graduates at this level possess/demonstrate the KSAAs required to perform  SOF-related  air  advisor  duties.    CAAs  maintain  the  highest  language,  regional expertise, and culture proficiency per SOF-directed requirements. Table 3.1.

Augmentees  supporting  air  advising  activities,  not  addressed  in  Basic,  Advanced,  or CAA  air  advisor  education  and  training,  require  some  level  of  training  as  determined  by applicable theater requirements and/or the supported organizations. 3.4.  Air Advisor Education and Training Methods. 3.4.1.  Air  advisor  education  and  training  may  be  offered  in-residence  at  an  air  advisor training school or via a mobile training team at a location convenient to the customer. 3.5.  Air Advisor Education and Training KSAAs. 3.5.1.  MAJCOMs  conducting  air  advisor  education  and  training  will  develop  air  advisor course material that ensures graduates meet the KSAAs corresponding to each level. AFI10-4201V1  25 JUNE 2015   17  3.5.2.  Paragraph 3.6 (below) lists each of the KSAAs in text format.  The level of knowledge required in each of these areas is consistent with the corresponding conditions and standards in  the  DoD  Guidance  on  Common  Training  Standards  for  Security  Force  Assistance.    The KSAA  list  is  all  inclusive.    To  determine  the  KSAA  applicability  by  air  advisor  level  and required  skill,  see  Table  3.2:    Air  Advisor  Education  and  Training  Level  Qualitative Requirements. 3.6.  Determining  Requirements  for  Air  Advisor  Training.  The  following  examples  are designed to describe a situation and analyze training requirements based on complexity/scope of air advisor task, operating environment, and the primary/secondary nature of the advisor duties. 3.6.1.  Owning MAJCOMs will conduct a thorough analysis of the mission requirements that govern their designated air advisor unit taskings.  The mission analysis will evaluate both air advisor  mission  complexity  and  the  operating  environment.    Based  on  this  analysis,  the training requirements will be defined as either Basic, Advanced, or CAA.  Personnel meeting the  qualitative  requirements  in  Table  3.2.  and  any  additional  unit-  or  MAJCOM-required training shall be reported as mission ready (T-3). 3.6.1.1.  Example analysis: 3.6.1.1.1.  Designated  Air  Advisor  Forces/Units  (primary  BPC/SFA  MET).    A CONUS-  or  OCONUS-based  unit  has  the  primary  task  to  conduct  air  advising activities with FSF units.  These missions routinely require an air advisor to operate in  a less-developed country that has no indigenous US  military presence  or support, and  missions  require  FSF  qualification  training  on  a  complex  task.    Missions  could also  include  operational-level  advising  on  organizing,  training,  and  equipping  FSF aviation  forces.    Advanced  air  advisors  may  also  support  the  development  or restructuring  of  the  FSF  aviation  enterprise  in  accordance  with  theater  campaign plans and overall U.S. regional strategies. 3.6.1.1.2.  Designated  Air  Advisor  Forces/Units  (additional  BPC/SFA  MET).    A theater-based USAF unit has the task to conduct  routine mil-to-mil engagement in a permissive environment with a locally-based FSF unit that has similar mission and/or capability.    These  units  have  a  small  cadre  of  assigned  personnel  qualified  as  air advisors to lead and participate in partner nation engagements as an additional duty.  The tasks often involve simple/basic interoperability and shared training.  Advisors at this level generally do not provide qualification-level training to the FSF. 3.6.1.1.3.  Expeditionary Air Advisor Forces.  Expeditionary air advisors are Airmen that fill temporary duty positions as an air advisor external to their normal duties or unit of assignment.   These Airmen operate for short durations in  small teams,  as  an augmentee to a designated air advisor force/unit, or as part of a larger expeditionary air advisor unit for longer durations. 3.6.1.1.4.  Air  Advisor  Augmentees.    Airmen  who  support  air  advising  activities  on an  as  needed  basis  without  an  enduring  requirement  for  air  advisor  training.    Air advisor augmentees require some level of training as determined by applicable theater requirements and/or supported organization.    18  AFI10-4201V1  25 JUNE 2015 3.7.  Air Advisor KSAAs. 3.7.1.  Air Advisor KSAAs.  For more detail on the specifics of each KSAA and applicable air  advisor  training  requirements  refer  to  DoD  Memo:    Guidance  on  Common  Training Standards for Security Force Assistance.  The common SFA standards are guidance, offer a set  of  benchmarks  to  identify  and  train  Airmen  to  conduct  SC  events,  and  articulate  to planners  the  capabilities  and  skill  sets  required  when  requesting  forces.

Overview.  This  chapter  discusses  air  advisor  mission  qualification  training  (MQT), continuation training, specialized training, and recertification training. 4.2.  MQT.  MAJCOMs with designated air advisor forces/units will ensure these units develop a MQT program that are designed to ensure personnel are mission ready and fully trained in unit-specific air advisor requirements (T-1).  Note:  AFSOC’s advisor MQT is completed through the CAA pipeline. 4.3.  Continuation  Training.  MAJCOMs  with  designated  air  advisor  forces/units  will  set standards for continuation training that are designed to ensure individuals maintain proficiency in applicable air advisor KSAAs (T-1). 4.4.  Specialized  Training.  While  priority  is  placed  on  course  material  that  meets  air  advisor education  and  training  standards,  MAJCOMs  are  authorized  to  build  syllabi  and  provide specialized training in addition to the courses associated with each air advisor training level. 4.4.1.  Examples  of  specialized  training  include  advanced  language  education  and  training, education  and  training  on  specialized  skills  and  programs,  aircraft  qualification  training, alternative weapons familiarization training, or advanced weapons qualification training. 4.4.2.  In  order  to  allow  a  previously  trained  air  advisor  to  deploy  elsewhere,  an  individual trained  in  one  language,  regional  expertise,  or  culture  may  receive  specialized  training  in another language, regional expertise, or culture. 4.4.3.  USAF  officers  preparing  to  serve  as  defense/air  attachés  and  regional  affairs strategists receive specialized training to cover specific air advisor responsibilities (e.g., core air  advisor  KSAAs)  not  addressed  elsewhere  in  their  education  and  training.    HQ AETC/A3Q,  in  coordination  with  SAF/IA,  determines  the  need  and  assists  in  developing associated training requirements if necessary. 4.4.4.  Specialized  courses  may  also  meet  previously-discussed,  MAJCOM-directed continuation training requirements. 4.5.  Requalification Training. 4.5.1.  MAJCOMs conducting air advisor education and training will develop requalification standards that meet mission requirements (i.e., Basic, Advanced, CAA) and take into account previous qualification and experience level of the air advisor. 4.5.2.  Previously qualified Basic air advisors upgrading to Advanced or CAA will attend the full Advanced or CAA course (T-1). 4.5.3.  Individuals who have not served in an air advisor capacity or have not conducted air advisor  education  and  training  in  over  24  months  require  requalification  training  prior  to conducting air advising activities (T-1). AFI10-4201V1  25 JUNE 2015   25  Chapter 5 AIR ADVISOR INSTRUCTOR TRAINING 5.1.

ADL  is  an evolution  of  distributed  learning  that  emphasizes  collaboration  on  standards-based  versions  of reusable  objects,  networks,  and  learning  management  systems,  yet  may  include  some  legacy methods and media.  ADL is structured learning that takes place without requiring the physical presence  of  an  instructor.    Although  the  USAF  uses  the  term  advanced  distributed  learning, some federal  agencies and DoD components may  use the term  distance learning.  These terms refer to the same basic concept. Advise—For  purposes  of  this  instruction,  the  term  advise  applies  to  the  act  of  communicating professional  knowledge  and  skills  to  foreign  service  forces  personnel.    The  act  of  advising   32  AFI10-4201V1  25 JUNE 2015 consists of five basic activities:  assessing, training, advising, assisting, and equipping.  Advising involves the practical application of operational doctrine and TTPs in a partner nation and may be  in  the  form  of  direct  support  that  may  or  may  not  include  combat.    Advising  is  real-world, situation-specific, and may directly implicate the U.S.  in  a given partner  nation contingency or operation.  Generally, the step from training to advising requires approval of the U.S. President. Air Advising—A category of related activities that provides the basic operational methods used by USAF personnel to work with partner nations to develop, sustain, and employ their aviation enterprise to meet their national security needs, in support of U.S. interests.  In essence, it is the act  of  communicating  professional  knowledge  and  skills  to  partner  nation  personnel.    Air advising occurs within the following five core tasks:  assessing, training, advising, assisting, and equipping. Air Advising Activities— For the purpose of this instruction, are defined as security cooperation efforts  conducted  in  support  of  combatant  commander  and/or  COMAFFOR/TSOC  objectives across the range of military operations. Air  Advising  Augmentees—Those  forces,  not  defined  as  air  advisors,  but  who  support  air advising  activities.    Air  advising  augmentees  require  a  level  of  training  as  determined  by applicable theater requirements and/or supported organization. Air  Advisor—An  Airman  specially  trained  and  educated  to  apply  aviation  support  and operational expertise to assess, train, advise, assist, and equip partner nations in the development, sustainment, and employment of their aviation enterprise to meet their national security needs, in support  of  US  interests.    This  includes  both  Conventional  and  Special  Operations  Force personnel. Airmen—For  purposes  of  this  instruction,  applies  to  all  ANG,  AFRC,  Regular  Air  Force,  and government civilian USAF personnel. Airpower Capabilities—For purposes of this instruction, includes all air, space, and cyberspace capabilities that are associated with a partner nation’s military-oriented aviation enterprise. Allocation—A class seat reserved for a specific program user at their request. Assess—Assessment  is  (1)  a  continuous  process  that  measures  the  overall  effectiveness  of employing  joint  force  capabilities  during  military  operations;  and  (2)  determination  of  the progress  toward  accomplishing  a  task,  creating  an  effect,  or  achieving  an  objective.    For  the purposes  of  this  instruction,  the  term  assess  is  one  of  five  basic  advisor  activities.    In  this capacity,  it  refers  to  measuring  the  effectiveness  of  security  cooperation  at  the  strategic, operational, and tactical level.  It similarly refers to determining progress toward accomplishing security cooperation objectives, effects, and tasks.  More specifically for the air advisor, it refers to  developing  an  executable  and  assessable  event-level  plan  and  after-action  report  with appropriate linkages to operational-level plans.  Finally, it refers to an air advisor responsibility to assess a partner nation’s aviation capabilities. Assist—For purposes of this instruction, the term assist applies to the act of providing support or aid to partner nation personnel executing specific missions.  Assisting is one of five basic advisor activities.  Assisting is a form of direct support that may or may not include combat.  Generally, the  step  from  advising  to  assisting  requires  approval  of  the  U.S.  President  when  the  tasks  are performed in conjunction with real-world military operations. AFI10-4201V1  25 JUNE 2015   33  Aviation  Enterprise—The  sum  total  of  all  air  domain  resources,  processes,  and  culture, including personnel, equipment, infrastructure, operations, sustainment, and air mindedness. Aviation  Enterprise  Development  (AED)—Defines  the  plans,  programs,  and  activities undertaken to develop the system of systems necessary for a nation to optimize employment of national  aviation  resources.    The  total  aviation  resource  capacity  and  capability  of  a  nation  is defined  by  the  sum  total  of  all  air  domain  resources  including  humans,  aircraft,  processes  and infrastructure in both the civilian and military/security sectors.  Modern standards that function to  provide  efficient,  safe  and  effective  employment  of  national  aviation  resources  calls  for infrastructure  development  that  considers  the  civilian  aviation  sector  and  the  military/security aviation  sector  of  a  nation  as  mutually  supportive  systems  of  an  integrated  air  domain  in developing nations. (Air Force Global Partnering Strategy) Building  Partnerships  (BP)—BP  Joint  Capability  Area.  The  ability  to  set  the  conditions  for interaction with partner, competitor, or adversary leaders, military forces, or relevant populations by  developing  and  presenting  information  and  conducting  activities  to  affect  their  perceptions, will, behavior, and capabilities. (Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review Report, January 2009) Building Partner Capacity (BPC)—Assisting domestic and/or foreign partners and institutions with  the  development  of  their  capabilities  and  capacities—for  mutual  benefit—to  address  US national  or  shared  global  security  interests.  (Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  Policy Memorandum, Joint Capability Areas).  An outcome of Security Force Assistance activities, it is the development of capabilities and capacities among foreign partners for the mutual benefit of the partner and US  national  or shared global security interests.  This  definition is derived from the Tier III JCA of “building the capabilities and capacities of partners and institutions but is not defined in Joint Publications or other DOD Issuances.  (SFA Lexicon and Framework) Certification—A  formal  indication  of  an  individual’s  ability  to  perform  a  task  to  required standards. Combat  Aviation  Advisor  (CAA)—The  CAA  is  a  combat  aviation  advisor  specifically organized  to  assess,  train,  advise  and  assist  foreign  aviation  forces  in  the  employment  and sustainment  of  their  own  assets  in  both  peace,  war  and,  when  necessary,  integrate  those  assets into  joint,  multi-national  operations.  A  principal  objective  of  CAA  advisory  operations  is  to facilitate the availability, reliability, safety, and interoperability of partner nation or participating nation aviation resources to support combined Special Operations Forces.  (definition extracted from AFSOCI 16-101V3, Combat Aviation Advisor (CAA) Operations) Continuation  Training—Additional  training  beyond  the  air  advisor  training  levels  with emphasis  on ensuring designated force  air advisors remain  current  and qualified to perform  air advisor duties. Counterinsurgency (COIN)—Comprehensive civilian and military efforts designed to simultaneously  defeat  and  contain  insurgency  and  address  its  root  causes.  (JP  3—24, Counterinsurgency) Designated  Air  Advisor  Forces/Units—  Those  forces  and/or  units  with  air  advising  designed operational capability statements and mission essential tasks.  Designated air advisor forces/units have  readiness  requirements  for  personnel,  training,  and  equipment,  if  applicable,  and  report those  requirements  in  status  of  resources  and  training  system  and  defense  readiness  reporting   34  AFI10-4201V1  25 JUNE 2015 system.  Personnel assigned to the air advising mission in designated forces/units are required to accomplish air advisor education and training at  the Advanced or Basic level  prior to reporting ready for the air advisor mission. Educate—The act of instructing and/or studying that is focused on creative problem solving that does  not  provide  predictable  outcomes.    The  act  of  educating  encompasses  a  broader  flow  of information to the student and encourages exploration into unknown areas and creative problem solving. Education  and  Training  Course  Announcements  (ETCA)—A  website  that  provides information  on  USAF  education  and  training,  to  include  MAJCOM  procedures,  fund  cite instructions,  reporting those  formal  courses  conducted, administered, or managed by USAF MAJCOMs. instructions,  and listings  for Equip—For  purposes  of  this  instruction,  the  term  equip  applies  to  the  act  of  furnishing  or provisioning  partner  nation  personnel  for  service  or  action.    Equipping  is  one  of  five  basic advisor activities.  Individuals performing air advisor may be expected to facilitate the transfer of U.S.  defense  articles  and  services  under  security  assistance  programs  to  eligible  partner  nation aviation units. Expeditionary  Air  Advisor  Forces—  Those  individuals,  teams,  or  units,  who  are  not  aligned with  an  air  advising  designed  operational  capability  statements  or  mission  essential  tasks.  Consequently,  expeditionary  air  advisor  forces  have  no  specific  readiness  requirements  for personnel, training, and equipment and do not report such requirements in status of resources and training  system  and  defense  readiness  reporting  system.    Expeditionary  air  advisor  forces  are required to accomplish air advisor education and training at the Advanced or Basic level to serve in an expeditionary air advisor capacity. Exemption—For  purposes  of  this  instruction,  the  term  exemption  applies  and  may  be  granted when other training or experience meets or exceeds a specific air advisor syllabus requirement or set of requirements. Fieldcraft—For purposes of this instruction, the term fieldcraft applies to an area of air advisor education  and  training  focused  on  KSAAs  of  a  force  protection  and/or  expeditionary  nature.  These KSAAs are required to enable graduates to safely and effectively perform their duties in the  expected  operating  environment,  while  protecting  their  equipment  and  other  resources.  Additionally, fieldcraft education and training is typically tailored to meet the requirements of an anticipated deployed location, threat, mission, and/or duty assignment.

The  act  of  training encompasses the set of events or activities presented in a structured or planned manner through one  or  more  media  for  the  attainment  and  retention  of  required  KSAAs.    For  purposes  of  this instruction,  training  is  one  of  five  basic  advisor  activities.    Individuals  performing  air  advisor activities may be expected to train partner nation military aviation forces to operate and sustain indigenous airpower resources and capabilities.  This training enables foreign aviation forces to accomplish a variety of airpower functional tasks, roles, and missions and can provide a doctrinal or  procedural  foundation  for  military  operations  and  activities.    Training  can  be  used  to  close specific gaps in foreign skills and to raise the partner nation level of competency. Uncertain  Environment—Operational environment in which host government forces, whether opposed to or receptive to operations that a unit intends to conduct, do not have totally effective control  of  the  territory  and  population  in  the  intended  operational  area.
