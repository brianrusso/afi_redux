Evaluating Food Service. The Food Service officer (FSO) uses one copy of AF Form 1038, FoodService Evaluation Record, to rate food service operations quarterly. Keep a copy of the checklist untilthe next evaluation. See the checklist at Attachment 2. 1.2.  Five-Year Facility and Equipment Improvement Plan. The purpose of the five-year program isto provide a comprehensive, phased improvement program that serves as a management tool for the FoodService officer. The objective is to achieve comparability with generally accepted commercial food ser-vice standards. Achievement of the objective is dependent on a well-planned program of identifying facil-ity deficiencies and efficient use of limited funds in implementing the program. All new projects orfacility upgrade projects must be reviewed and approved by the Major Command (MAJCOM) and Head-quarters, Air Force Services Agency, Air Force Food Service Branch (HQ AFSVA/SVOHF). FSOs areencouraged to use the Food Service Annual Operations & Maintenance Budget spreadsheet. 1.3.  Guest Feedback. Use AF Form 27, Food Service Customer Survey, base, or MAJCOM approvedform to get feedback from your guests. Make forms available to all dining facility guests. The diningfacility manager should respond to guest’s concerns, usually with a telephone call. Make notes of the con-versation on the backside of the form used and file for future reference. 1.3.1.  The FSO must establish a forum to discuss food service issues with base Essential StationMessing (ESM) guests formerly, Subsistence-in-Kind (SIK) guests. As a minimum, attempt to haveESM representatives from each organization, Military Public Health, the Prime Vendor, and HealthPromotions officials attend the meeting. Use results from the meeting to improve the Food Serviceprogram. 1.4.  Recommendations for Improvement. Let your MAJCOM counterpart know if you have sugges-tions to improve the Air Force Food Service management program. 1.5.  Revisions to Air Force Menu. Make revisions for the following reasons only satisfy the prefer-ences of your guests with due validation, provide choices to accommodate religious observances, and addculturally diverse, specialty meals, or increase menu variety. 1.6.  Posting Menus. Post menus in locations where your guest can see them when entering the servicearea. Post the price of each item. 1.7.  Computer Malfunction. Food Service managers and cashiers must be aware of contingency plansto be used in the event that computers or point of sales (POS) are down. Keep a complete set of manualforms and current Sales Item Listing on hand in case automated operations cease. Recommend the follow-ing options when POS or computers are down: 1.7.1.  If only one of several POS system is not functioning, route all Basic Allowance for Subsistence(BAS) and guests paying cash through the operating registers and all meal card guests through a sec-ond line to sign AF Form 79, Headcount Record. AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 200571.7.2.  Use adding machines or hand calculators to determine the amount of each purchase by guestspaying cash. Also, total the amount of each purchase by meal card guests unless this will slow the linespeed beyond a tolerable rate. 1.7.3.  As a last resort, revert to the standard Department of Defense (DoD) meal rates. 1.7.4.  For ESM customers at all locations, the facility manager will use 40% of the current meal costallowance. Contact HQ AFSVA/SVOHF for the current meal cost allowance. 1.7.5.  At automated locations, the dining facility manager manually inputs the ESM and cash data inSales Entry when the system comes back up. The facility manager must track food items consumed.Take the number of servings prepared and subtract the number of servings leftover or discarded. Thiswill provide the amount to sell for manual sales items. Exact procedures can be found in the CorporateFood Service (CFS) Handbook. 1.8.  Menu Item Pricing. At automated dining facilities, the recipe cost and selling price is calculated forindividual portions of each menu item. Each price is based on current inventory item numbers and pur-chase prices. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF, commonly referred to as Corporate Food Service (CFS), maintains allfiles, which contain recipes, inventory items, portion sizes, and sales items. Complete details of all stan-dard recipes and methods used by Air Force activities are found in the Air Force Food Service RecipeSystem, distributed by Headquarters, Air Force Services Agency, Contractor Support Branch (HQAFSVA/SVSDA). 1.8.1.  The automated pricing system adds an additional 20% to the basic cost per portion of all itemsserved in Appropriated Fund (APF) food activities. This addition is intended to cover condiments andshortening that are not recipe ingredients and food preparation losses from spillage, burning, dis-carded, etc. Do not charge for condiments, gravy, or sandwich toppings. 1.9.  Who Can Eat in Appropriated Fund Dining Facilities. See AFI 34-239, Food Service Manage-ment Program, attachment 9. 1.10.  Emergency Situations. Installation commanders can allow off-base civilians, noncombatant evac-uees, and family members evacuated from other Department of Defense (DoD) installations to eat in thebase dining facilities during emergencies. 1.10.1.  During disaster or emergency conditions, these instructions apply to all Food Service activi-ties: 1.10.1.1.  The installation commander provides the Mission Support Group Commander with astatement in writing describing the emergency and the persons to whom it is essential that the AirForce furnish food for a limited time. 1.10.1.2.  Use AF Form 79 to record signatures and collect cash. 1.10.1.3.  Collect cash from persons able and required to pay for meals. Ask those persons unableto pay for meals to sign AF Form 79 as receiving a meal without charge. 1.10.1.4.  If it is not feasible to obtain signatures, the Mission Support Group Commander certifiesthe number of meals furnished and takes credit for the meals served. Give written justification forservice of meals without charge or signatures. Keep documentation supporting the entries on AFForm 1119-1, Manual Monthly Monetary Report (RCS: HAF-SVS(M)9122). The FSO will8AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 2005forward all documentation to the MAJCOM and HQ AFSVA/SVOHF for approval. This proce-dure applies only to all personnel involved in disasters or emergencies. 1.10.1.5.  At automated locations, the dining facility manager manually inputs the ESM and cashdata in Sales Entry for that day. Find exact procedures in the Corporate Food Service (CFS) Hand-book. This procedure applies only to all personnel involved in disasters or emergencies. 1.11.  Special Operational Rations for Major Disasters and Emergencies. Food Service operationsare authorized to purchase and store Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) in support of major disasters and emer-gencies. Purchase a maximum of a 2-day supply of MREs per ESM patron (example: 100 ESM membersx 3 meals per day x 2 days = 600 MREs purchased to support this requirement). Units requiring theserations will contact HQ AFSVA/SVOHF before ordering any MREs for this purpose. 1.12.  Unannounced Spot-Check of Cashier. Use AF Form 282, Unannounced Spot-Check of Cash-ier, at least monthly to spot check each cashier function to make sure cashiers are using proper proceduresin cash collection and forms control. Prepare one copy and send to Food Service officer for review andcorrective action. 1.13.  Funds Protection. See AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program and the Installa-tion Security Plan (ISP) for funds protection in a Food Service facility. AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 20059Chapter 2  GUEST IDENTIFICATION 2.1.  Identifying Dining Facility Guests.  2.1.1.  At Corporate Food Service (CFS) bases, ESM guests use DD Form 714, Meal Card, or DDForm 2, Armed Forces of the United States Geneva Conventions Identification Card commonlyrefer to as a Common Access Card (CAC) for identification. The cashier enters the meal card numberor social security number into the cash register. 2.1.2.  At automated bases, an individual's social security number (SSN) is used from DD Form 2 toverify the meal card entitlement. The accountant inputs this data in the main dining facility computerdatabase using Frequent Buyer (FB). If the guest's number is not in the Frequent Buyer database, thecashier obtains their name, rank, squadron, telephone number, and SSN. The cashier records thisinformation legibly on AF Form 1469, Essential Station Messing (ESM) Invalid Entitlements Log.The facility manager will turn in the form(s) to the accountant every day. The accountant mustresearch each signature on the AF Form 1469, to ensure that only those authorized ESM receive mealsat government expense. The accountant will make corrections daily in the FB database to ensure theinformation is current. The Food Service accountant normally keeps this record on file with ESM reg-isters. 2.1.3.  ESM personnel not on leave or temporary duty (TDY) status may use their meal card from theirpermanently assigned base to eat at other Air Force bases. The FSO will include instructions to beused by visiting ESM members in the cashiers' procedures. 2.1.4.  Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corp (ROTC) students in training status are identified byDD Forms 714 (stamped ROTC), training rosters, or special orders. 2.1.5.  Enlisted personnel of the Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard on training status are iden-tified by DD Form 2AF (RES). At automated locations, input the name and entire SSN of eachReserve and Guard member into the Frequent Buyer database for the point of sales (POS). This devel-ops a report that eliminates the need for these guests to sign an AF Form 79. 2.1.6.  Members of other active duty services stationed on or attached to a non-automated base use DDForms 714 with "COMMON SERVICE" stamped in bold letters across the front. 2.1.7.  Enlisted members of the Reserve forces and National Guard in annual training status show thecashier a copy of their TDY orders. All reserve forces receive standard rate (type S) BAS. The codeson orders may read FG, the standard rate of BAS for enlisted or FH rations in kind not available. Referto AFI 34-239, attachment 9, for special circumstances. 2.1.8.  Personnel in a TDY status must present identification and a copy of their orders if they are notpaying the standard rate. 2.1.9.  Members of Reserve forces and National Guard of other services (e.g., Army National Guard,Marine Reserves, etc.) are no longer cross-billed. However, continue to process these guests at thecash register as described above. 2.1.10.  Active duty Air Force Office of Special Investigations TDY members identify themselves tocashiers using the DD Form 1173, US Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card.Block 11 of the card will indicate that the member is active duty. 10AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 2005Chapter 3  CONTROL OF SIGNATURE FORMS AND CASH 3.1.  Forms.  3.1.1.  Control of Headcount Records. Use AF Form 1254, Register of Headcount Record, to controlthe receipt and issue of AF Form 79, Headcount Record. 3.1.1.1.  The Food Service accountant prints the forms, assigns the serial numbers in numericalorder, and stores them in a locked area. The Food Service accountant enters the serial numbers innumerical order on the first column of the applicable AF Form 1254. Make entries on the AFForm 79’s serial number in blue or black ink or stamped. 3.1.1.2.  If issuing a single form, have the receiver sign and date the AF Form 1254 opposite theassigned number. 3.1.1.3.  If issuing a block of numbered forms, draw a diagonal line through the signature columnfrom the top line of the first number issued down and across to the bottom line of the last numberissued. 3.1.1.4.  The issuing official picks up AF Form 79. Upon completion, enter the date returnedacross from the serial numbers that apply on AF Form 1254. Investigate any missing serial num-bers. Enter the amount of cash collected for each sheet in the appropriate columns. 3.1.1.5.  After all forms are checked for accuracy, the person picking up the forms and money (ifapplicable) signs in the "cash received" column of AF Form 1254. 3.1.2.  The Food Service accountant travels to dining facilities, obtains funds and controlled formsusing AF Form 1305, Receipt for Transfer of Cash and Vouchers to document the transfer ofresponsibility. 3.1.2.1.  The individual collecting cash from dining facilities, consolidates the collection and pre-pares DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher. They turn in the consolidated cash to theaccounting and finance officer who assigns a voucher number to DD Form 1131 and closes out thetransaction. Record the voucher number in the last column of AF Form 1254 opposite the numberof each AF Form 79 supporting the turn-in not later than two workdays after receiving it fromfinance. 3.1.3.  Headcount Record. AF Form 79 is the basic record used for collecting and accounting for cashreceived from the sale of meals by cash and ESM customers. It is also used to identify personnelserved and support headcount. All manual operations will use this form regardless of the type of facil-ity. Automated bases will use this form as defined in paragraph 1.7. Make all entries on the AF Form79 in black or blue ink. 3.1.3.1.  The cashier obtains only one signature from each person for each meal consumed. If sec-ond servings are available, they are considered part of the same meal. Except at automated facili-ties, patrons will sign AF Form 79 as follows: 3.1.3.2.  An ESM member assigned to the base enters a payroll signature, grade, and last four dig-its of the meal card number or social security number. AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 2005113.1.3.3.  An Air Force transient enters a payroll signature, grade, and a short abbreviation of theparent organization (such as 482 CSS). Enlisted members of other services use their branch of ser-vice, instead of meal card numbers. Change the social security number column to read "Org" (fororganization) if the form is used for transients. 3.1.3.4.  Individuals on common service status sign the AF Form 79 marked for their branch ofservice and enter short abbreviations of their unit organization (such as 41NFBN) instead of mealcard numbers. Change the social security number column to read "Org" if used for common ser-vice personnel. 3.1.3.5.  Individuals on cross-service status sign the AF Form 79 marked for their category. Theyenter short abbreviations of their organization instead of meal card numbers. Change the socialsecurity number column to read "Org." 3.1.3.6.  If the total number of ESM meals served averages less than 100 meals a day, use the sameform for the whole day. Separate the signatures that apply to each meal by a dividing line betweeneach meal or by a margin notation. Because the form provides supporting headcount data for dailysales, use a separate AF Form 79 for each day. Exceptions are small units where daily posting ofheadcount data is not required. In these instances, divide AF Forms 79 by using lines to reflectmore than one day's use. Use a separate form for each of the special categories of personnelserved. 3.1.4.  If the number of guests who pay cash is small, the form may be used for the whole day byinserting a heavy dividing line after the last signature for each meal. 3.1.4.1.  The cashier requires the entry of each guest's signature, grade, meal charge, and operatingcharge in the appropriate columns. At the end of the meal, day, or duty shift, the cashier totals thecolumns, brings forward the balances, and determines the total collections due, as specified on AFForm 79. They block out unsigned lines on the forms and turn over all funds collected to the din-ing facility manager. The manager verifies the totals, records any cash overage or shortage, andexplains any differences on the form in the explanation block. The cashier signs their name andgrade as the person making collections. The manager also signs to certify the collection and torelieve the cashier of responsibility for the cash and forms. 3.1.4.2.  Situations when a designated person may sign and pay for other members: 3.1.4.2.1.  If it is necessary to feed a group within a specified time period, such as at trainingcenters and special schools. 3.1.4.2.2.  Under emergency conditions. 3.1.5.  Receipt for Transfer of Cash and Vouchers. Use AF Form 1305 for transferring cash and con-trolled forms between facilities, managers, shift leaders, and cashiers. A completed and signed AFForm 1305, showing breakdown of cash by denominations, must be on file in the funds storage con-tainer whenever cash or controlled forms are removed. Also, use this form to transfer daily receiptscollected by cashiers after each meal. Complete the form in two copies, one for the person acceptingthe cash and forms and one for the remitter. 123.2.  Cash Turn In.  AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 20053.2.1.  In manual operations, each workday the Food Service accountant collects AF Forms 79, andthe total cash collected for the previous day from each dining facility. Document the transfer on AFForm 1305. The FSO or a designated representative: 3.2.1.1.  Verifies and reconciles AF Forms 79 and DD Form 1131 entries against cash. 3.2.1.2.  Determines whether cash overages or shortages reported are reasonable. 3.2.1.3.  Annotates AF Form 1254 to show the date that each AF Form 79 was returned, theamount collected, and certifies with his/her signature. 3.2.1.4.  Verifies missing forms and prepares a report of survey, if necessary. 3.2.1.5.  For assessing value use the current DoD lunch meal rate for each line of the form. Suchloss by a contractor is processed according to contract provisions. 3.2.2.  Cash Turn-In from automated dining facilities. Food Service accountants or other representa-tive designated by FSO travel to dining facilities to collect cash, the Sales Offset Report, cash regis-ter receipts, and any controlled forms. Use AF Form 1305 to record the transfer. 3.2.3.  Form Preparation for Cash Turn-In. At bases that have both automated and manually operateddining facilities, key manual data into Form Flow or other automated form program to produce a com-puter-generated DD Form 1131 to submit to Accounting and Finance Office. 3.2.4.  Cash Turn-In to Accounting and Finance Office. The FSO or contractor prepares DD Form1131 in duplicate. The original is kept by the accounting and finance officer. File the copy in the FoodService office along with supporting documentation. In contract operations, contractors may keep athird copy for their records. 3.2.5.  Accounting Classification. Enter the detailed accounting classification obtained from account-ing and finance. Also, enter the accounting classification for operating charge funds collected. For fullFood Service contract bases, deposit 100 percent of this money into the base or Services Operationand Maintenance (O&M) account, to assist in funding the contract. For bases with Food Service atten-dant contracts or no contracts at all, credit operating charge funds collected to the financing appropri-ation, Operation and Maintenance (O&M), and Air Force Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA),based on the percentage of local dining facilities military and civilian manpower authorizations.Deposit the percentage that results from military authorizations in the MPA appropriation and thedeposit civilian percentage in the O&M appropriation. HQ AFSVA/SVF publishes these accountingclassifications in a signed memo yearly. 3.2.6.  Cash Overages and Shortages. For control and information purposes, enter the consolidation ofcash overages or shortages in the lower part of the "detailed description of purpose for which collec-tions were received" column. Use the following accounting classifications for overages: 57R 1060******. Obtain numbers for the asterisks from the base Accounting & Finance office. All shortageswill have the ESM accounting classification published by HQ AFSVA/SVF. Total all amounts at thebottom of DD Form 1131. 3.2.7.  The Turn-in Copy. Food Service uses the turn-in copy of DD Form 1131, which serves at thevoucher. Use DD Form 1131 as a cover sheet for the AF Forms 79 (as applicable), Sales OffsetReport, cash register receipts, and for multiple automated operations, the Cash Reconciliation ReportAFMAN34-240   2 MAY 200513from Corporate Reporting. The FSO enters the voucher number in the last column of AF Form 1254,opposite each AF Form 79, as applicable. 3.2.8.  Verifying the Cash Collection. The FSO verifies the cash collected on each DD Form 1131using supporting documentation such as AF Forms 79, as applicable, point of sales (POS) registertapes, and/or the Sales Offset Report. In addition, the FSO: 3.2.8.1.  Verifies the number of collection sheets used to make up the voucher. 3.2.8.2.  Totals the amounts collected and ensures the correct funds were turned in on DD Form1131. 3.2.8.3.  Verifies the accounting and finance office has stamped DD Form 1131 with the time,date, and amount deposited. Under the Integrating Paying and Collecting system (IPC), make surethe finance cashier has signed or initialed the cash collection voucher. 3.2.8.4.  After verifying, initial the DD Form 1131 in the "total" item. 3.2.8.5.  At least monthly, check totals on DD Form 1131 with Finance to ensure proper amountsare turned in. 3.3.  Accounting for Funds Collected from Local National Personnel Overseas.  3.3.1.  Meal reimbursement charges apply to direct hire local nationals at Air Force or overseas,appropriated fund Food Service facilities operated by local nationals, unless existing agreementsestablish other rates. In those cases, rates for these personnel are established locally and require HQAFSVA/SVOHF approval. 3.3.2.  The difference between the amounts paid by local national employee and the meal chargesspecified must be paid from the appropriation from which the local national personnel salaries arepaid. Commanders establish internal accounting controls and budget for funds to provide the differ-ence so that full reimbursement is made to the subsistence fund. 3.3.3.  At non-automated activities, local national personnel paying cash for meals (reduced or fullpayment) or not paying for meals sign AF Form 79. When meals are sold at a reduced rate, the facilitymanager takes full credit regardless of the amount of payment. On DD Form 1131, the manager showscash collected from these personnel as a separate entry to avoid double credit. When collections arenot in US currency, the accountant prepares a separate DD Form 1131. 3.3.4.  If at all possible, the next revision of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) should indi-cate that cross service reimbursement be discontinued and require all members and local nationals topay cash when eating in the dining facility. 14AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 2005Chapter 4  MANUAL FOOD SERVICE ACCOUNTING 4.1.  Manual Sales Form. AF Form 1650b, Manual Sales form must be maintained for each manual din-ing facility. The Food Service manager uses one copy of this form to recap the number of meals served toeach category of personnel authorized to subsist. Satellite facilities furnish AF Form 1650b, ManualSales (with backup data of AF Forms 79, DD Forms 1131, and cash) to the parent dining facility. Oncethe day is closed, send the form to the Food Service office along with AF Forms 79. 4.1.1.  Guests at satellite Food Service locations order food from priced menus provided by the sup-porting dining facility. Meals may be consumed at the site or consumed away from the facility. Eachperson orders a meal and signs an AF Form 79. The Food Service manager certifies ESM and BASstatus, completes the form, and collects the cash indicated from BAS personnel before providing themeal. 4.1.2.  The manager returns completed forms and cash to the supporting dining facility. Attach theforms as documentation of entries in the parent dining facility. Manual operations will input the sup-porting data on AF Form 1119-1. The parent facility will add AF Form 79 data on the consolidatedDD Form 1131. Automated operations will input manual sales at the parent facility. Manual SalesEntry can be found in the CFS Handbook. 4.1.3.  Each unit, authorized by the combat support flight chief to use AF Form 79, establishes itsrequirements for the form through publication and distribution channels. 4.2.  Manual Monthly Monetary Report. Use AF Form 1119-1, Manual Monthly Monetary Report,at all manual locations to keep a daily standing of sales versus food cost. Close out the form as of the lastday of each accounting period. Send the form to the Food Service office. The Food Service officer orsuperintendent will use the following crosscheck procedures: 4.2.1.  Column E, Total Sales. Column B + Column D = Column H 4.2.2.  EOM Total for Column E, Total Sales. Add the Column downward. 4.2.3.  Authorized Tolerance. Column H times 3 percent. 4.2.4.  Column I, Total Food Costs (theoretical)/Issues to Kitchen. Opening inventory or purchases +or – Column G – Column H, inventory value. 4.2.5.  Gain/(Loss). Column E (Total) – Column I. 4.3.  Meals from a Dining Facility for Consumption Elsewhere.  4.3.1.  Two types of flight meals (small and large) are offered from a dining facility or a flight kitchen.This permits paying guests a choice of meal prices. The selling price is based on the current fiscal yearDoD meal rates. 4.3.2.  If the combat support flight chief agrees it is not practical for individuals to pick up their ownmeals for consumption away from the dining facility, use the following procedures: 4.3.2.1.  The FSO provides written procedures to the requesting activity specifying the advancenotice required, the menus available, and the time and location for pickup. AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 2005154.3.2.2.  The noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC) of the activity requesting meals will: 4.3.2.2.1.  Give advance notice of the number and types of meals ordered as required by theFSO. 4.3.2.2.2.  Prepare an AF Form 79, indicating the name, grade, and meal card or SSN of eachperson who desires a meal and is authorized to eat at government expense. Indicate the spe-cific section and squadron requesting the meals in the organization block. 4.3.2.2.3.  Send the completed forms and money collected to the dining facility. 4.3.3.  The dining facility manager will: 4.3.3.1.  Review forms for accuracy and use to support entries on AF Forms 79. 4.3.3.2.  Instruct the person who picks up the meals to sign AF Forms 79 certifying receipt of themeals. 4.3.3.3.  Use the type of meals that are picked up to determine the cash collection rates and themeal credit allowances. 4.4.  Fire Station Kitchens. If the mission support group commander decides food service will be pro-vided at the fire station, the level of service will be hot meals for lunch and dinner seven days a week. TheFSO will establish and coordinate procedures to have food served on a schedule basis. These proceduresmust be approved by USAF/ILV, Director of Services, before implementation. 4.4.1.  The facility manager will: 4.4.1.1.  Provide the menus to the fire chief each evening so firefighters can select menu items forthe next day. 4.4.1.2.  Use a Food Service attendant to serve food as well as drive the vehicle to transport mealsto the fire station. 4.4.1.3.  Provide the equipment necessary to transport food, including the vehicle. Under contractoperations, the contractor may provide the vehicle. 4.4.2.  The Fire Chief will: 4.4.2.1.  Provide enough space for a serving area, ware-washing area, and a dining area. 4.4.2.2.  Maintain and secure the serving and dining areas during non-serving hours as required bythe Director of Base Medical Services. 4.4.2.3.  Notify Food Service of menu choices at least two hours before the beginning of the serv-ing period. 4.5.  Field Feeding Accounting Procedures. The field-feeding environment during exercises and at Ser-vices Combat Training Sites (SCTS) no longer requires modified accounting and reporting procedures.Use a special field ration meal allowance in lieu of a meal allowance. Use only one type of allowance forthe entire exercise or contingency operation. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF provides this allowance to the MAJ-COM quarterly. 4.5.1.  The following procedures do not apply to field/contingency operations. These proceduresapply to local base exercises only. 16AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 20054.5.1.1.  Automated operations will transfer the food to an “AF Exercise” in Inventory Control(CFS). Input the name of the exercise in the remark section of the adjustment entry. The transfer isthe beginning inventory for the exercise. 4.5.1.2.  During the exercise collect signatures and cash on AF Form 79, Headcount Record,which consolidates all types of meals for both Essential Station Messing (ESM) and cash custom-ers. This information will help the manager complete AF Form 1650b. 4.5.1.3.  At the end of the exercise, conduct a complete physical inventory. The total will be whatyou will transfer back in to the dining facility. Subtract the beginning inventory from the endinginventory and this will be the dollar value of what was used during the exercise. This total shouldalso match the transfers. Take the transfer out and subtract the transfer in - the total should matchwhat was used. Make sure the facility manager and NCOIC of the field feeding operation sign allthe documentation (transfers). 4.5.1.4.  Take your cash collected, and AF Form 1650b for manually entering the data into thefirst sales day after the exercise. After the front of house EOD on the day you are manually enter-ing the exercise information, follow the guidance for manual sales entry in the CFS Handbook. 4.5.2.  SCTS and field/contingency will use a single copy of AF Form 1650b, Manual Sales on aweekly basis to recap the meals served. Post AF Form 1119-1, Manual Monthly Monetary Reportweekly and the last day of each month. 4.5.3.  Each base Food Service activity conducting field feeding (whether part of a large scale exerciseor contingency) will carry forward gains/losses each month throughout the fiscal year. The organiza-tion responsible for providing the subsistence and making purchases must submit AF Form 1119-1,Manual Monthly Monetary Report for the exercise/contingency, and then each month following,provide AF Form 1119-1 until either the gain/loss is zero, or the end of the fiscal year occurs. If nofeeding occurs on subsequent months, only report the carryover and/or inventory on AF Form 1119-1.Investigate any gains/losses exceeding 3% of the total income versus purchases and forward the inves-tigation results with the AF Form 1119-1. 4.5.4.  HQ AFSVA/SVOHF must approve all requests for operational rations. Each base must use an80-digit Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) requisition format. Donot use base O&M funds to purchase operational rations. 4.5.5.  Use the dining facility Production Log, as the plan for food preparation. 4.5.6.  Use AF Form 35l4, Inventory Count Worksheet, to record weekly and monthly inventories.After the end of field exercises, return all unused rations in unopened cases to the supporting baseactivity. 4.6.  Issuing Meals-Ready-to Eat (MRE) from Food Service.  4.6.1.  If another unit needs operational rations, food service purchases the rations and transfers themto the receiving unit using AF Form 3516, Food Service Inventory Transfer Sheet. One individualfrom that unit must sign for the rations, account for meals sold, and turn in remaining rations andpaperwork to the Food Service office. Manual operations will complete the field accounting in accor-dance with (IAW) paragraph 4.5.1. If the unit does not return to the base providing the rations, theFood Service section at their home base completes the accounting and forwards through their MAJ-AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 200517COM. Coordination between these units is essential to ensure all operational rations are accounted forproperly. 4.6.2.  When MREs are used in local exercises by organizations other than Services, the followingapplies: 4.6.2.1.  The base FSO obtains MREs and puts them on AF Form 28, War Reserve Materiel(WRM) Ration Report (RCS: HAF-SV(M)9601. The FSO or designated representative trans-fers the rations from AF Form 28 to the requesting organization on AF Form 3516. 4.6.2.2.  The FSO provides the using organization with AF Forms 79 and current meal rates. TheFSO advises the organization that the rations are accountable. When the exercise is concluded, allrations not documented as issued or sold on AF Form 79 must be immediately returned to FoodService, with the turn-in of cash collected and/or ESM signatures on AF Form 79. 4.6.2.3.  Once all meals, forms, and cash have been received, manual operations will complete AFForm 1119-1 to account for the use of meals during the exercise. For automated Food Serviceoperations, input the manual sales in Inventory Control. Follow instructions in the CFS Handbookfor Manual Sales Entry procedures. 4.6.3.  Account for individual meals (MREs) in Inventory Control for automated locations or AFForm 1119-1 for manual operations. Transfer whole cases of MREs to the AF Form 28. 4.7.  Meals, Ready-to-Eat (MREs) Positioned on Aircraft for Emergency Purposes. The followingguidance is provided in the event MREs are required to be placed on Air Mobility Command (AMC) air-craft for emergency consumption - i.e., aircraft diverted to a location without access to subsistence. 4.7.1.  Food Service will transfer the required MREs to the aircraft via AF Form 1297, TemporaryIssue Receipt. If the MREs are consumed on the aircraft, the members will sign for them on an AFForm 79, Headcount Record. The individual who signs the AF Form 1297 must inform the memberswhen issuing the MREs to claim them as government-furnished meals on their travel voucher so theirper diem can be reduced accordingly. 4.7.2.  Upon return to home station or arrival at another Air Force base with a Food Service operation,the accountable individual will turn in the unused MREs, the AF Forms 79 and 1297, and the collectedcash. The automated Food Service operation will receive all rations in as a transfer-in and then enterthe sales manually in Inventory Control (instructions in the CFS Handbook. 4.7.3.  Do not charge MREs to organizational funds when issued for consumption or potential con-sumption. Members in TDY status receive per diem for travel days. Members must pay for the MREsor claim them on their travel voucher as a meal provided at no cost. If box lunches/MREs are issuedto members on the processing line, they must pay for them. 4.8.  MREs in Processing Lines. Members in TDY status receive per diem for travel days. Membersmust pay for the MREs or claim them on their travel voucher as a meal provided at no cost. If boxlunches/MREs are issued to members on the line, they must pay for them. Orders must state Meals Pro-vided at Government Expense. Members in Group Travel Status--Enlisted Members provide meals atGovernment Expense--Officers/Civilians pay the Discount Rate. Remember the Finance Officer/Comp-troller answers questions on entitlements. Please ensure you coordinate with the Accounting and FinanceOffice (AFO). 18AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 2005Chapter 5  CORPORATE FOOD SERVICE ACCOUNTING 5.1.  Collection of Headcount. In automated operations, the cashier rings each customer through thePoint of Sales (POS) system. Sales, formerly known as earned income, are calculated based on food costfor each item a customer purchases. ESM sales are also calculated based on food cost for each item thecustomer chooses. Refer to paragraph 1.6. for computer malfunctions. 5.2.  Sales Offset Report. Bases with one dining facility will print the Sales Offset Report from AlohaBack Office. The report lists general ledger activity resulting from processed sales transactions for theentire day. It also provides supporting documentation for the DD Form 1131. The manager must print thisreport daily to verify the total dollar amount received at the registers. The report will be included as sup-porting documentation for DD Form 1131. 5.2.1.  Cash Reconciliation Report. For bases with more than one operation, this report is availablein Corporate Reporting (normally in superintendent/account office). Use the report to compare dol-lar amounts with deposit slips and cash register receipts. Print the report daily and attach to DD Form1131, Cash Collection Voucher. The Food Service Officer (FSO) must verify the proper amounts onDD Form 1131 at least monthly. 5.3.  Sales Item List. This lists the item names, how each item is sold through the point-of-sales (POS),and the selling price for each item. An item is sold either by a recipe or directly out of the inventory. Themanager should print this list monthly in case of computer malfunctions. 5.4.  Sales and Cost Report (RCS: HAF-SV(M)0311. This report summarizes the results from pro-cessed sales and item transactions. It lists sales, costs, gross profit amounts, and percentages for a varietyof meal periods. Managers will use this report to keep a daily standing of sales versus theoretical foodcost. Cost percentages should be between 75% and 85% (80% being the target). The CFS Handbook pro-vides exact procedures for interpretation of this report. Food Service accountants must print this reportmonthly. 5.5.  Corporate Reporting. Corporate Reporting gathers data from all facilities on base and providescentralized reporting for the Food Service superintendent or Food Service officer. The Food Serviceofficer or superintendent will use the Corporate Sales and Cost Report to determine the financial status ofthe Food Service operation. Further, Corporate Reporting eliminates the need of manual printed reportsthrough automatic data roll-ups to HQ AFSVA/SVOHF. If a base does not report for more than sevendays, the facility manager will accomplish manual accounting procedures until the system is back on-line. 5.6.  Uncosted Inventory Items Report. Uncosted on-hand quantities for inventory items result whenthe system detects usage of an item that exceeds the on-hand inventory. This essentially means that youhave used products that are not accounted for in the inventory. (Selling more than what you actually haveon hand, according to the computer). Managers must review and take corrective action as defined in theCFS Handbook at least daily. 5.7.  Financial Summary. The food manager must try to keep each food account within three percent ofthe total income versus total purchases. AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 200519Chapter 6  ORDERING AND INVENTORY FOR ALL FOOD SERVICE OPERATIONS (DINING HALL, FLIGHT KITCHEN, CENTRAL PREP, AND FIELD FEEDING) 6.1.  General Procedures:  6.1.1.  Full Food Service contract operations follow the procedures in the Performance Work State-ment (PWS). 6.1.2.  Military operations: 6.1.2.1.  The FSO designates in writing, by name and duty title, the persons responsible for thesecurity of food in each facility. 6.1.2.2.  Storeroom personnel will weigh and count all food received, thawed, issued, or returnedto the storeroom. 6.1.2.3.  Storeroom managers must ensure the code dates are posted for vendor items and thatdeliveries are checked for freshness and contract compliance. The storeroom manager requestsassistance from the Military Public Health (MPH) inspector when necessary and advises theDefense Supply Center, Philadelphia (DSCP) account manager when the requirements of the con-tract are not met. 6.1.2.4.  Use base organizational Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funds (3400) to purchaseice; items such as paper products, plastic ware, charcoal or lighter fluid; and beverage dispensingequipment leasing and service. Do not use ESM funds to purchase these items. 6.2.  Subsistence Evaluation. The dining facility manager documents and reports unsatisfactory subsis-tence annually. Complete the survey found on Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) Subsistenceweb site www.dscp.dla.mil/subs/pvsurvey/subsurv.htm. Print the screen before sending. 6.2.1.  If storeroom personnel experience problems throughout the year, contact the DSCP accountmanager within the region. If the problem is not resolved in a reasonable amount of time, contact theMAJCOM or HQ AFSVA/SVOHF. Make sure documentation of the problem, recommended solu-tions and point of contact is included in all requests. 6.3.  Production Log. The Production Log dictates Food Service production. The facility manager com-pletes a Production Log for each meal, based on the 14-day menu. The Production Log lists items to beserved for a particular meal, who will prepare the item, temperature checks, taste testing initials, recipenumbers, sale item numbers, serving sizes and utensils used on the serving line, and progressive cookingtime and amounts. Use a separate Production Log for each meal and separate each short order, salad, andpastry Production Log. Accurate information in this form is vital to ensure ordering and forecasting pro-grams operate effectively. 6.4.  Automated Ordering Procedures.  6.4.1.  For automated locations, order food from Prime Vendor using CFS automation. Prime Vendor,the DSCP account manager, and the Food Service staff set the schedule frequency for ordering anddelivery of subsistence. Normal ordering timeframes are within 48-72 hours before the issue date. 20AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 20056.4.2.  The storeroom manager will prepare a separate order for each type of vendor. The facility man-ager must ensure the headcount projected and quantities to prepare for the ordering period are accu-rate. In addition, the facility manager must verify order quantities before transmission to DSCP. Usethe purchase order as the back dock receipt when receiving the subsistence. If food is purchased fromthe Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), use the Government Purchase Card (GPC). See paragraph6.16. for more information on GPC use. Find exact automated ordering procedures in the CFS Hand-book. 6.5.  Vendor and Inventory Items. Every item in the inventory has a six-digit number assigned to it.Link all items in use to a Vendor Item contained in a vendor catalog. Some Inventory Items have multipleVendor Items. These are nested items such as Soda Fountain. DSCP assigns a 13-digit national stocknumber (NSN) to each vendor’s product(s). At a minimum, DSCP sends the catalog via e-mail to all auto-mated facilities weekly. 6.5.1.  The storeroom manager will ensure each inventory item number in use is linked to a vendoritem number. Once a catalog is imported, the storeroom manager must verify the conversion for thepurchase unit of measure for all linked items. Verify the effective date on all catalog imports by select-ing the “hide quote” button under vendor items. 6.6.  Call Number. Inventory Control will automatically assign a reference number to every purchaseorder. DSCP/STORES web assigns a call number to all orders processed through CFS automation. Thecall number is used to track ESM subsistence expenditures from the time the food is ordered until the SF1080, Voucher for Transfers Between Appropriations and/or Funds is paid. 6.7.  Confirmations. STORES web will send an Order Confirmation via e-mail, showing the processedorder through DSCP’s automated system. Compare the order confirmation with the Purchase Order. Themanager will ensure the quantities ordered and prices match. Once the food is received, the storeroomclerk will print out the Purchase Journal before processing the invoice. Once the facility manager veri-fies and sends the invoice, STORES web will send a Receipt Confirmation. Storeroom managers mustcheck the dollar amounts and quantity of each line item match between the Receipt Confirmation andthe Purchase Journal. The storeroom manager will combine the purchase order, Order Confirmation,vendor invoice, Purchase Journal, and Receipt Confirmation and forward all documentation within 24hours to the Food Service accountant. 6.8.  Cost Corrections. If the accountant finds any errors on the invoice entries, corrections must beaccomplished in the Inventory Control, Cost Corrections and on STORES web under receipt adjustments.Refer to AFI 34-239, paragraph 5.7. for cost correction limitations. 6.9.  Thaw Report. In automated operations, generate the thaw report using the Projected Sales Wizard.Storeroom operations generate the report to meet requirements for the number of days identified and thecurrent 14 day cycle. The facility manager will ensure the headcount projected and quantities to preparefor the ordering period are accurate. 6.10.  Adjustment Entries. All adjustment entries are for the reduction of inventory. Production manag-ers are responsible for entry of the raw and finished waste after each meal. Enter only those servings morethan five on the waste log. AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 20056.11.  Manual Ordering Procedures.  216.11.1.  For installations without CFS, the type of communications available will determine how toorder subsistence. For sites with Internet capability, order subsistence using STORES web. Find exactordering procedures in the CFS Handbook. 6.11.2.  HQ AFSVA/SVOHF and the MAJCOM supporting the war fighting command is required tosupply the Prime Vendor Catalog to all sites. 6.11.3.  Sites will use e-mail or fax for all orders. Storeroom clerks will use the catalog provided byHQ AFSVA/SVOHF. Prepare the quantities and names for items to order and forward to the HQAFSVA/SVOHF. The HQ AFSVA/SVOHF will enter the information on STORES web. The diningfacility manager will keep one copy to help in estimating future requirements. 6.11.4.  The Food Service representative must sign and retain a copy of the vendor invoice at the timeof delivery of the food. Make sure the person requesting the food is not the same person who signs forthe food when received. Enter the total dollar value of all purchases for the respective day in columnF of AF Form 1119-1. 6.11.4.1.  Within 24 hours from the issue date make sure the facility manager forwards a copy ofall items received with items priced and extended to the Food Service accountant. After theaccountant reconciles, make any required changes to purchases, issues, and transfers. Forward allreconciled purchases to the Area of Responsibility (AOR) for bill payment. 6.12.  Food Service Inventory Transfer Receipt. In non-automated operations, accomplish transfersbetween and outside of Food Service facilities on AF Form 3516, Food Service Inventory TransferReceipt. This allows removal of food from one inventory and placed upon another (other appropriatedfund activities only). Also, use the form to send subsistence outside of Food Service (such as to a fieldexercise) or return food to the Food Service system. It is essential that food transferred outside of the FoodService system be adequately explained. For example, if food is transferred to a unit deploying to yourlocation, provide the name and location of the unit, and the quantity transferred. The receiving unit has theresponsibility for accounting for the food. By providing the name of the unit, the MAJCOM or HQAFSVA/SVFRS can track the expenditures. 6.12.1.  For automated operations, follow procedures as outlined in the CFS Handbook. For food thatis transferred out to another automated facility, use Enter and Send Inter-Unit Transfers (TransfersOUT). For food that is brought in to the facility’s inventory, use the section referencing Transfers IN(Inter Unit Transfers). 6.13.  Transfer Reconciliation. The accountant must run the Transfer Reconciliation Report from Cor-porate Reporting daily to ensure all transfers are recorded on the same day for all facilities. 6.14.  Inventory. Use AF Form 3514, Inventory Count Worksheet, to record the physical inventory offood on-hand at non-automated operations. The inventory includes all food in the storerooms, refrigera-tors, and freezers of the dining facilities and central preparation facilities, which is not prepared for con-sumption. Include condiments previously removed from the storeroom, or opened containers, regardlessof issue or consumption dates. There are two types of inventory procedures: 6.14.1.  Weekly counts. Manual operations will count everything on-hand each week. Record thecounts on AF Form 3514, Inventory Count Worksheet. Automated operations will only count those22AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 2005items defined by Corporate. Record those items on the Count Sheet within Physical Counts. Auto-mated operations will follow physical count procedures contained in the CFS Handbook. Before thePhysical Count is processed, print the Edit List from Inventory Control. Conduct the inventory at thesame time on the same day each week. 6.14.1.1.  Weekly counts will include condiments previously removed from the storeroom, oropened containers, regardless of issue or consumption dates. Do not count food items issued foradvance preparation and prepared meals that may be consumed before the end of day processing. 6.14.2.  Monthly Counts. At the close of business on the last day of each month, the FSO assignssomeone other than the storeroom personnel to conduct a physical inventory at each Food Servicefacility. The closing inventory of one period is the same as the opening inventory of the followingperiod. 6.14.2.1.  Manual operations will enter the date and name of the person responsible for the FoodService account. Two copies and proper certification are required on all formal inventories, whichare taken when the account is transferred. File one copy with AF Form 1119-1 and give either thesecond copy to the responsible person from whom the account is transferred or the Quality Assur-ance Personnel (QAP). One copy of the inventory is sufficient at all other times. Add a statementthat the inventory is true and correct on the last page of AF Form 3514. The person who took theinventory signs the statement and the FSO certifies the inventory. 6.14.3.  Price items on the inventory at the prices listed at the time of receipt. If like items in stockwere received at different prices, enter each quantity priced and extended at its own price. 6.14.4.  Automated operations will follow the same guidance as defined in paragraph 6.13. Record thephysical counts on the monthly Count Sheets. The person performing the count will sign the EditList Count Sheet, certifying the inventory is correct. The Food Service manager will also sign theEdit List Count Sheet. 6.14.5.  Once this process is completed, the Food Service manager in contract operations will print outtwo copies of the On Hand Summary Report (RCS: HAF-SVO(A)0304). The FSO will sign all theOn Hand Summary Reports. Provide one copy to the Food Service accountant/QAP—the contractorwill keep one copy. Non-Contract operations will print one copy of the monthly On Hand SummaryReport (RCS: HAF-SVO(A)0304). The FSO will sign the On Hand Summary Report and file withthe accountant. 6.14.6.  End of Year Inventory. Conduct the end of fiscal year inventory IAW AFI 34-239, paragraph5.6. 6.15.  Inventory Levels. Peacetime inventory levels for main dining facilities are recommended to beonly $15K and smaller facilities to include flight feeding should be $10K. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF mustapprove contingency and wartime inventory levels. 6.16.  Government Purchase Card (GPC). The subsistence GPC is a credit card used to make pur-chases from the commissary or other approved source at locations that can accept the card (CONUS),some overseas locations). HQ AFSVA/SVOHF must approve any other local sources. Purchases on thiscard are only for emergency purposes, when your normal subsistence provider cannot supply a neededitem. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF will approve all emergency GPC purchases if Defense Commissary AgencyAFMAN34-240   2 MAY 200523(DeCA) or the DSCP Prime Vendor cannot satisfy the requirement. Local contracting offices provide thecard and procedures. 6.16.1.  All purchases must be pre-approved by the unit’s Approving Official. The Approving Officialmust maintain an official GPC control log to issue control numbers to cardholders. Use this log tocompare the value of purchases with the statement from the credit card company. 6.16.2.  Select food items and proceed to the cash registers for checkout. Do not exceed $2,500 pertransaction limit or the approved monthly funding target of $5,000 per card. Use the GPC to finalizethe purchase at the register. The cardholder then enters the value of the purchase on the control log. 6.16.3.  A Cardholder must be the FSO or dining facility manager. Contract personnel are not autho-rized to use the GPC for subsistence. In contract-managed operations, the Food Service QAP will bethe authorized individual. 6.17.  Purchase Reconciliation 6.17.1.  The FSO or a designated representative, such as the Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP) infull Food Service contract operations, must verify the total food purchases monthly with the SF 1080,Voucher for Transfers Between Appropriations and/or Funds. The accountant in all operationswill use the SF 1080 spreadsheet or MAJCOM approved equivalent to record all purchases and anyreconciliation. Automated operations will record the information from reconciling the receipt confir-mation and the purchase journal. Manual operations will use STORES web, Receipt Adjustmentsfrom the STORES web. Keep reconciliation documentation on file with all supporting documentation. 6.17.2.  The base Food Service accountant will work any discrepancies with the DSCP account man-ager. DFAS sends the credited SF 1080 and adjustment documents directly to the dining facility forverification and reconciliation. 6.17.3.  STORES web will automatically generate a receipt for the entire order on the fifth day afterthe required delivery date if a facility manager has not submitted a receipt for any line item on order. 24AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 2005Chapter 7  CENTRAL PREPARATION KITCHENS 7.1.  Central Pastry Kitchens. If the pastry kitchen is physically separated from other dining facilities, itmaintains its own accounting records. Use the pastry Production Logs for quantities to prepare. 7.2.  Dining Facility Pastry Kitchens. A pastry kitchen operating as part of the dining facility accountcontrols food and transfers the finished pastry product to other facilities in Inventory Control, Adjust-ment Entry (Transfer Out). They will not maintain separate accounting records. Manual operations willtransfer baked products to other facilities on AF Form 3516, Food Service Inventory Transfer Receipt. 7.3.  Subsistence and Monetary Controls.  7.3.1.  At automated dining facilities, the recipe cost and selling price is calculated for individual por-tions of each menu item. Each price is based on current inventory item numbers and purchase prices. 7.3.2.  Inventory Levels. Inventory levels for Central Preparation Kitchens will not exceed $15Kunless approved by HQ AFSVA/SVOHF. 7.3.3.  Physical Inventory. All inventories will be conducted IAW paragraph 6.14. 7.3.4.

Normally, the duration of a flight should be in excess of three hours before ameal is authorized. Consider pre- and post-flight activity when determining if a meal is authorized. 8.1.2.  Passengers. Passengers may be furnished a meal if they are on a flight in excess of three hours. 8.1.3.  Patients. Air Force flight kitchen facilities prepare and issue regular flight meals for hospitalpatients aboard aero medical evacuation aircraft. The aero medical evacuation control officer from theinstallation medical facility obtains the modified diet items and special meals. 8.2.  Expanded Flight Kitchens  8.2.1.  This facility is designed for authorized personnel working on the flight line or other work cen-ters on the installation. Menu items can range from hamburgers, fried chicken, hot dogs, French fries,soups, salads, baked items, chili, assorted beverages, pastry items, and various condiments. 8.2.2.  Expanded flight kitchens will use the Aloha front of the house or POS system to sell menuitems other than the large and small menus. 8.2.3.  Expanded flight kitchen menus have been set in CFS and will be pushed from the ALOHAInventory Control to the registers at the front of the house. Small and large menus are also preset andwill be manually input at the end of the day. Use the FOH sales reports and cashier receipts to recon-cile cash turn-ins and give an account of all transactions (voids, surcharge, Essential Station Messing(ESM), and cash sales). 8.2.4.  Enter flight meals manually on the BOH, Inventory Control, under Sales Entry. Do not entersales until after the FOH end-of-day has run. 8.3.  Menu Patterns. The menu patterns for flight meals listed in the Air Force worldwide menu will befollowed, to include the Core Flight Meal Program. Sandwiches, salads, fruits, and vegetables will bemerchandised in transparent plastic containers. Expanded flight kitchens will follow menu patterns asdefined for dining facilities in the Preface to the Worldwide Menu. 8.4.  Types of Flight Meals and Allowances. This information is in AFI 34-239, attachment 4. A mini-mum of 2 hours is required for flight meal preparation. This is to ensure freshness of products and foodsafety. 8.5.  Reimbursements for Meals. Crewmembers and passengers normally pay cash for their meals. 8.5.1.  The Food Service accountant computes the cost of liquid coffee as follows: One pound ofground coffee yields 2.75 gallons of liquid coffee. The reimbursement rate for 2.75 gallons of bulkliquid coffee is the price of one pound of coffee plus the actual cost of cream and sugar furnisheddivided by 2.75. For example, $1.94 (for coffee) plus $0.194 (for cream and sugar) equal $2.134divided by 2.75 equals $0.776; adjusted to the nearest 5 cents is 80 cents per gallon. 8.6.  Inventory Controls. All flight kitchen operations will follow guidance as referenced in Chapter 6. 26AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 20058.6.1.  Monitor item quantities used to prepare meals and adjust menus as required to prevent exces-sive gain or loss. The FSO should make a random sample check of prepared meals at least weekly toprevent excessive variance between meal cost and the inventory allowance. 8.7.  Request for Flight Meals. AF Form 79 provides a continuous record of flight meals requested andcash collected. Use the form for refunds when meals are paid for but not consumed through no fault of thepassenger or crewmember. 8.7.1.  The traffic officer, operations officer, combat alert officer, aircraft commander (or designatedrepresentative), or the flight kitchen manager, completes AF Form 79 and collects money. The personwho completes this form will notify the flight kitchen manager of the number of meals required. 8.7.2.  Flight kitchen personnel complete the form if passengers and crewmembers order individualflight meals from the flight kitchen. 8.8.  Issue of Flight Meals.  8.8.1.  If flight kitchen personnel issue meals directly to passengers and crewmembers, the receivingpersonnel sign AF Form 79 to indicate receipt of the meals. 8.8.2.  If flight kitchen personnel issue meals to fleet or passenger service for delivery to aircraft,record the number and type of meals on AF Form 3516. Keep one copy as a supporting document andgive a copy to fleet service personnel. 8.8.3.  Air Mobility Command (AMC) Cold Banner and Special Assignment Airlift Missions(SAAM). Cold banner refers to any mission, which supports or is directed by the President of theUnited States. SAAM refers to any mission directed as a special assignment airlift mission by AMC.On request, flight kitchens furnishing flight meal support will issue flight meals or bulk issue items forpreparation aloft without reimbursement. 8.8.3.1.  The flight kitchen will take full credit on AF Form 79. Aircraft number and home base areindicated on AF Forms 3516 and 79. The loadmaster acknowledges receiving the meals by signingAF Form 3516. The support base Food Service sends one copy of AF Form 3516 to the FSO at thehome base where the flight originated. 8.8.3.2.  Cash collections for meals are made when the meals are served. The loadmaster may turnin cash collected and unused meals at the main overnight base Food Service, if desired. The load-master turns signature sheets, cash, and unused meals (or receipts for cash and meals) in to thehome base. The home base flight kitchen supervisor verifies the number of meals issued and used.Accountability will be maintained for all meals during the entire mission. 8.9.  Cash Controls. The flight kitchen manager must: 8.9.1.  Make sure the current flight meal supplement, snack meal, and bulk liquid beverage reimburse-ment rates are collected from guests. 8.9.2.  Provide safeguards for the change fund and cash collected. 8.9.3.  At passenger terminals where fleet service collects a considerable amount of cash from the saleof flight meals, cash will be deposited directly with accounting and finance. The passenger serviceofficer will prepare DD Form 1131 in sufficient copies to provide the FSO with a copy for reconcilia-tion with the AF Form 79. AFO and the person turning in the funds must verify and sign the forms.AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 200527The flight kitchen manager will ensure the DD Form 1131 is turned-in within seven (7) days. AReport of Survey is required after 30 days. 8.10.  Cash Refund Procedures for Flight Meals. Passengers and crewmembers may receive refundsfor meals and snacks purchased but not consumed, due to circumstances beyond their control. For exam-ple, flights may be delayed or canceled, meals may not be served because of equipment failure, or mealsmay not be delivered to the aircraft. 8.10.1.  Before a refund is made, the aircraft commander or loadmaster must certify that meals werenot served. The passenger service officer or designated representative will: 8.10.1.1.  Complete the refund certificate on the passenger's boarding pass or ticket receipt. 8.10.1.2.  Give the reason for refund and include any pertinent information (for example: flightcanceled, second meal not placed in aircraft at originating station, passenger bumped off flight,etc.). 8.10.1.3.  Sign the certificate. 8.10.2.  The passenger completes the refund data on the reverse side of AF Form 79. Annotate the rea-son for the refund in the explanation for refunds. Refunds of the amount paid may be made at the orig-inating or terminating passenger terminal facility, or flight kitchen. One crewmember can sign forrefunds of the entire crew meal order. To support cash refunds to passengers and crewmembers, AFForm 79 must be attached to the file copy of DD Form 1131 submitted to accounting and finance. 8.10.3.  If crewmembers and passengers do not receive purchased bulk liquid beverages; they mayreceive reimbursement by presenting a signed statement of non-receipt from the aircraft commanderto the passenger terminal cashier or flight kitchen. In addition, the person receiving the refund mustsign the back of AF Form 79. AF Form 79, with the aircraft commander's signed statement ofnon-receipt attached, must be attached to the file copy of DD Form 1131 submitted to accounting andfinance. 8.10.4.  The above procedures permit refunds for flight meals at a different base than where the collec-tion was made. 8.11.  Unsafe Food Items. If a flight kitchen manager suspects food items are unfit for human consump-tion or unsafe for service in flight, have Military Public Health (MPH) inspect the items. If the MPH con-demns the items, the manager completes the AF Form 3516, in duplicate, as follows: 8.11.1.  In the consignee block of the form enter the word "Condemned" and add the following certif-icate "I certify the food items listed above are unsafe for flight Food Service or human consumptionand are not to be used for flight meals." 8.11.2.  The MPH inspector will sign this certificate. The flight kitchen will certify the final disposi-tion of all condemned items on AF Form 3516 before dropping the dollar amount from the inventory.The flight kitchen will keep the original as a supporting document and the MPH inspector will keepthe second copy. 8.11.3.  At automated locations, in order to remove items from the inventory, the facility manager willmake the necessary adjustment entries in accordance with the CFS Handbook, Enter and ProcessAdjustments (Daily Waste). Manual operations will annotate the transfer in column G of AF Form1119-1. 28AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 20058.12.  Excess or Surplus Flight Meals Aboard Military Aircraft. Fleet service must turn over to theflight kitchen excess or surplus flight meals from transient or terminating mission aircraft. In the absenceof a flight kitchen, turn them in to a dining facility. The flight kitchen or dining facility makes dispositionas indicated below: 8.12.1.  The FSO prepares an AF Form 3516 (in duplicate) to receipt for all meals received (frozen,spoiled, or thawed) and requests inspection by the MPH inspector. The FSO who receives the mealssigns both copies of AF Form 3516. The loadmaster or flight traffic specialist keeps the original andthe FSO keeps the duplicate as a supporting document. 8.12.2.  After the MPH inspector determines if the food is fit for human consumption, the MPHinspector will annotate the AF Form 3516 with a recommendation for disposal. 8.12.3.  In all cases, the MPH inspector determines the fitness and use of precooked frozen meals, aswell as any other questionable food item. 8.12.4.  Turn-ins or write-offs of surplus meals will be accompanied by the original AF Form 3516issued to the loadmaster or flight traffic specialist. The flight kitchen manager uses current prices forMeals Cooked, Frozen (MCF), or flight meal components available at the receiving flight kitchen. Ifprices are unavailable there, the manager will use prices from the originating base's AF Form 3516. 8.13.  Unused Food Aboard Military Aircraft. Fleet service will return all unused bulk subsistenceitems to the flight kitchen. In the absence of a flight kitchen, return the items to the dining facility. TheFood Service person who receives the food items prepares AF Form 3516. The recipient signs both cop-ies. Fleet service keeps the original and the MPH inspector keeps the duplicate as a supporting document.After the MPH inspector certifies food items to be fit for human consumption, add all food items (exceptcondemned) to the storeroom inventory. 8.14.  Flight Meal Questionnaire. Use AF Form 27, Food Service Customer Survey, base, or MAJ-COM approved form to get feedback from your guests. Forms can be used in conjunction with all mealsavailable in the flight kitchen. Ensure a return address is placed on the reverse side of the form. In addi-tion, make forms available to all flight kitchen guests. The flight kitchen manager should respond toguest’s concerns, usually with a telephone call. Make notes of the conversation on the backside of theform used and file for future reference. 8.15.  Flight Meals Prepared in Dining Facilities. If the flight kitchen operates as part of a dining facil-ity, the FSO must report separately for the flight meal account on AF Form 79. Record food issued fromthe facility storeroom to the flight kitchen using Manual Sales Entry for a co-located operation. Exactprocedures are in the CFS Handbook. Manual operations will record flight meals on AF Form 1119-1. 8.16.  Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF). Passenger service representatives will providecomplimentary snacks and beverages (paid for by the TWCF), which will enhance passenger comfort dur-ing flight to all passengers on a no charge basis. Complimentary snacks are not intended to be provided inlieu of a meal and must not exceed 75 cents per passenger. 8.16.1.  Purchasing Food for Beverages and Snacks. Passenger service representatives may useTWCF to purchase subsistence items for beverages and snacks from flight kitchens on a reimbursablebasis. The Air Terminal manager (ATM) determines the types and quantities of beverages and snacksneeded. The cost of such items should not exceed 75 cents per passenger. The ATM should coordinateAFMAN34-240   2 MAY 200529with the local FSO and the accounting and finance office to establish procedures to receive bulk pur-chased beverages and snacks. Passenger service representatives will request bulk beverage and snackitems on AF Form 79, which will be signed by the ATM or designated representative. The ATM willcertify the bulk item receipt by signing in the signature block and inserting the words "TWCF PAS-SENGER MISSION" above the signature. 8.16.2.  Non-AMC Terminal Activities. At installations where there is no AMC terminal activity, theaircrew will identify to the local flight kitchen the proper billing address for beverages and snacksneeded to support the TWCF passenger mission. The billing address will be the accounting andfinance office of the aircraft's home station. 8.16.3.  Billing Instructions. Each flight kitchen must maintain a monthly record of all issued andcreditable returned items. Each month the FSO will furnish the accounting and finance officer AFForm 3515, Cross Service Billing showing issues less creditable returns. 8.16.4.  Authorized Monetary Allowance. The cost of complimentary snacks is limited to a maximumof 75 cents per passenger. Do not include complimentary beverages (coffee or tea) in this limit. Listunused snack and individually containerized beverage items on AF Form 3516 and turn in the items tothe flight kitchen. Flight kitchens originating TWCF complimentary snacks and beverage service willprovide the loadmaster with two AF Forms 3516, to aid turn in at the terminating station. Receivingflight kitchens will use current prices available at their installation when adding TWCF complimen-tary snacks and beverages to their inventory. If prices are unavailable locally, use the prices from theoriginating base's AF Form 3516. 8.16.5.  Determining Requirements. Normally the ATM determines requirements for complimentarysnacks and beverage requirements on the period of flight (morning, afternoon, evening), duration offlight, meal service availability, food item availability, and other local controlling factors. Flights ofless than 90 minutes are authorized TWCF complimentary beverages only. Flights over 90 minutesare authorized TWCF complimentary snacks and beverages. The ATM bases complimentary snacksand beverages on food items normally stocked by the local flight kitchen. The flight kitchen will notinclude major meal items, such as sandwiches, soups, or entrees, as complimentary snack items. Sam-ple selections of snacks are listed in the preface to the Air Force worldwide menu. 8.17.  Fleet and Passenger Services. If flight kitchen personnel issue meals to fleet or passenger servicefor delivery to aircraft, record the number and type of meals on the AF Form 3516. Keep one copy as asupporting document and give a copy to fleet or passenger service. Fleet/Passenger Service representativeand flight kitchen personnel must sign the AF Form 3516. 8.17.1.  Flight kitchen personnel must maintain a copy of the AF Form 79 provided by fleet and pas-senger service, once all transactions are complete. 8.17.2.  Fleet and passenger service representatives are responsible for cash turn-in to Accounting andFinance. They will complete DD Form 1131 in sufficient copies to provide the Food Service Officer/Flight Kitchen manager with a copy for reconciliation with AF Form 79. 8.17.3.  Manually enter the number and type of flight meals through the Sales Entry function (itemsales tab) of CFS using the AF Form 3516 as your source of meals and supplements issued. Thisaction will reduce the flight kitchen inventory. NOTE: There will be a remaining dollar amount in thesales day totals, place this amount in the Balance of Day. 30AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 20058.17.4.  Once the DD Form 1131 is received the dollar amount will be added to Sales Offset for cur-rent days transactions. (Sales Day Totals will not balance; the remaining amount will be placed in Bal-ance of Day). AF Form 3516 will support balance the day amounts. 8.17.5.  If the remaining dollar amount in the sales days totals exceeds $10, the facility manager mustprovide the MAJCOM with supporting documentation which explains the excessive dollar amount. 8.18.  Mission Essential Beverages (Liquid Coffee/Tea or Hot Chocolate) for ESM. Appropriatedfunds may not be used to provide free beverages to military or civilian employees. Members who meet therequirements are those who are exposed to the elements for extended periods, have no reasonable accessto refreshment sources, and where beverages are required to remain alert are authorized mission essentialbeverages provided at government expense using 3500 Appropriation for Subsistence in Kind funds. Forexample, Security Force personnel who are manning gates and guard posts and Civil Engineering person-nel who are involved in snow removal or work locations where there is no reasonable access to refresh-ment sources to remain alert. All other personnel would be required to pay for coffee or other beveragesprovided by Air Force dining facilities. 8.18.1.  The following procedures apply when requesting mission essential beverages from Air Forcedining facilities: 8.18.1.1.  The Officer/NCOIC of the activity requiring the beverage will prepare an AF Form 79,indicating the name, grade, and the last 3-digits of the SSAN of each person who desires bever-ages. The OIC/NCOIC must annotate their signature, rank, and duty phone in the remark sectionof the form. Provide the completed form to the dining facility manager/representative. The actualperson, who is picking up the beverages, must sign in the block “signature and Grade of PersonMaking Collection.” 8.18.1.2.  The unit requiring the beverages will be responsible for providing the container to trans-port the beverage. This procedure will not be used to provide beverages to command posts, unitwork areas, sales of sports beverages, or field exercises to include search and recovery. HQAFSVA/SVOHF must approve any other unique circumstances. 8.18.1.3.  The dining facility manager/representative will provide the liquid beverage in containersprovided by the requesting organization. 8.18.1.4.  The dining facility/flight manager will sell the beverage in 1/2-gallon (brewed) liquidincrements (No coffee grounds or dry products will be dispensed). Automated operations will usethe adjustment entries; transfer out to HQ AFSVA/Mission Essential Beverages (#200109). Thedollar amount will not exceed $.75 (cents) per person authorized. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF willreview this weekly to ensure bases do not exceed the authorized amounts. 8.18.1.5.  The dining facility/flight kitchen manager will turn-in the completed form to the foodservice accountant with a copy of the transfer document. 8.18.2.  Sports beverages (Gatorade) used as mission essential beverages. Bases will not use the 3500Appropriation for Subsistence-in-Kind fund to purchase sports beverages. Purchase sports beveragesusing Organizational (O&M) funds.

General. This chapter expands on responsibilities and policies to the FSO and superintendent forimplementing procedures for the authorization, acquisition, storage, use, and replacement of WRM oper-ational rations. It directs the FSO/superintendent to comply with applicable requirements levied by DoDand Air Force instruction and base supplements relating to WRM subsistence requirements at the opera-tional level. 9.2.  WRM Subsistence Authorizations. The following references are used for the WRM programwithin Air Force Services: 9.2.1.  AFI 34-239 outlines WRM and reporting requirements for subsistence planning. 9.2.2.  AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel, WRM, Program Guidance and Procedures, details require-ments for WRM, including WRM rations, which are determined by and reported to HQ AFSVA/SVOby the MAJCOMs. 9.2.3.  The War Consumable Distribution Objective (WCDO) document specifies MAJCOM require-ments for war consumable rations for aircrews and missile crews. This document is computed andpublished by each MAJCOM. 9.2.4.  MAJCOM supplements to AFI 25-101 are used in conjunction with other WRM directivessuch as MAJCOM Operational Plans (OPLAN), MAJCOM WRM storage plans, and other documen-tation levied at the wing and base level. 9.2.5.  Wing and base level supplements to AFI 25-101 outline plans for WRM requirements, includ-ing WRM operational rations, to be stocked in support of wartime contingencies. 9.2.6.  HQ USAF War and Mobilization Plan, Volume I (WMP-1), Annex GG – Services. 9.3.  WRM Requirements. The WCDO specifies the types and quantities of operational rations to main-tain as WRM at each installation. 9.3.1.  The Air Force WRM operational rations consist of MRE and UGR. 9.3.2.  MAJCOM/SVX will identify new or increased ration requirements by 15 March of each calen-dar year and forward to HQ AFSVA/SVOHF. If requirements are not identified, they will not befunded. 9.4.  Responsibilities. The FSO/superintendent is responsible for: 9.4.1.  Participating in planning and programming by personally visiting the base plans office at leastannually with the Services commander to jointly review the type and quantity of WRM rations to bestocked per WCDO and OPLANS. The FSO/superintendent must have a security clearance beforebeing permitted to view these documents. 9.4.1.1.  Participating in policies established by the base War Reserve Materiel Officer (WRMO). 9.4.2.  Maintaining accountability for WRM assets by: 32AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 20059.4.2.1.  Maintaining a copy of the MAJCOM WRM funded level ration requirements letter spec-ifying the quantities of WRM operational rations that are funded by HQ AFSVA/SVO. 9.4.2.2.  Ensuring the approved WRM funded level is not exceeded at anytime. 9.4.2.3.  Maintaining accurate records for WRM and peacetime operational rations. An AF Form28 should be maintained by date of pack and lot number. Report all (WRM and peacetime) opera-tional rations on the same AF Form 28 monthly. 9.4.2.4.  Approving the accuracy of the monthly AF Form 28 by reviewing and signing the form.A copy of the completed form will be provided to the base WRM monitor. 9.4.3.  Ensuring proper storage, adequate security, and replacement of WRM assets by: 9.4.3.1.  Storing under refrigeration where feasible. 9.4.3.2.  Making sure rations on-hand receipts stored by self sustaining units are replaced annu-ally. 9.4.3.3.  Following prescribed procedures for issues, transfers, and other dispositions of WRMsubsistence. 9.4.3.4.  Using storage facilities, which provide adequate security and proper storage conditionsfor WRM subsistence. 9.4.4.  Ensuring that WRM subsistence assets are inspected by MPH by: 9.4.4.1.  Identifying to the MPH office the date of pack, lot number, and inspection test date (ITD)of all rations on-hand in the warehouse and new acquisitions upon receipt. 9.4.4.2.  Notify MPH when follow-up inspections are due based on inspection documents pro-vided by inspectors from each inspection performed. 9.5.  Replacement of Operational Rations. DSCP limits activities to placing only one requisition peryear for direct vendor delivery (DVD) of MREs and UGRs. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF will requisition opera-tional rations annually to replace older stocks and fund new requirements that are to be maintained asWRM stocks at base level. 9.5.1.  The manufacturer will date stamp each case of operational rations reflecting an appropriatedate of pack and lot number. 9.5.2.  The manufacturer will date stamp the suggested inspection test date (ITD) on each case of oper-ational rations. Periodic inspections and evaluations by the local MPH inspector will determine theproper ITDs. 9.5.3.  Under normal conditions, MREs have an estimated shelf life of 36 months un-refrigerated.Under refrigerated conditions (35F-50F degrees), the shelf life may be extended to a maximum of 5years. The latter should be used where feasible. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF will plan on replacing/rotatingall WRM rations on an annual basis. 9.5.4.  Any shortages in the WRM account below current funded levels must be replaced within 30days. This is usually caused by release of WRM stocks by the Services Commander for exercises, etc. 9.5.5.  All requisitions for WRM replacements will contain project code 121 and advice code 2G. AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 2005339.5.6.  DVD MREs will be placed in WRM stocks upon receipt. Those operational rations stored areseparate from WRM stocks. The disposition of these rations remains the same. That is, either issuedfor exercises or turned in to Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO). They should bemonitored closely to ensure they do not exceed their shelf life. Always issue oldest stocks first basedon the date of pack. 9.5.7.  Ideally, Food Service operations should always have their funded level of WRM MREson-hand. However, should there be a requirement or if consumption exceeds the on-hand quantity,DSCP will meet those needs from depot stocks. 9.5.7.1.  Depot stocked MREs are older dates of pack and were previously held in refrigeratedstorage. They will normally expire within 12-18 months after removal from cold storage. 9.5.7.2.  Units or organizations requiring rations for exercises, etc., should provide their require-ments to the FSO allowing sufficient lead-time for requisitioning depot stocked MREs, preferably30 days for CONUS and 45-60 days for OCONUS. 9.5.7.3.  Food Service activities will requisition rations for all active duty units or organizations.ANG and AF Reserve units will requisition rations for their respective units through HQ AFSVA/SVOHF. AF Food Service will forward all requisitions to DSCP with an information copy to eachbase/unit. 9.5.7.4.  The Services commander or the appointed (in writing) designated representative mustapprove by signing AF Form 3516 for rations that impact on WRM stock levels prior to issue. Norequisitions will be placed or issues made without this approval. 9.5.7.5.  All requisitions for depot stocked MREs will bear project code 384 (identifies the itemsas other than WRM). Advice code 2J will be used on these requisitions. 9.5.7.6.  Should an issue of any WRM stocks be made for use during disasters, deployments, oremergencies not otherwise covered by HQ USAF OPLANS, replace these stocks according to theabove guidance. However, should WRM support be seriously impaired, the base WRM monitorwill coordinate with HQ AFSVA/SVOHF on replacing those stocks sooner with current date ofpack rations. 9.5.8.  Operational rations issued by Food Service for unit use during exercises, alerts, etc., may bereturned to Food Service within 72 hours after termination of the exercise or alert providing the fol-lowing conditions are met: 9.5.8.1.  MPH must inspect rations and certify the rations as still fit for their intended purposebefore returning to Food Service. Certification must accompany the rations returned to Food Ser-vice. 9.5.8.2.  The Food Service facility has a valid demand or future need for the rations. 9.5.8.3.  Partial cases of MREs that are to be reassembled in case lots must approximate the origi-nal menus as closely as possible. A maximum of two reassembled cases will be accepted at anyoccurrence. Food Service should indicate the oldest date of pack for the reassembled menus. 9.5.8.4.  List all rations returned to Food Service on AF Form 3516. 9.6.  Stock Replacement. Maintain an AF Form 28 for each type of operational ration, date of pack, andlot number. These records will provide information for stock replacement before the shelf life date. The34AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 2005AF Form 28 will be annotated to reflect the latest ITD by date of pack and lot number as determined byMPH. In addition, record the quantity of each issue of WRM operational rations on the AF Form 28(include unit issued to). All postings to the AF Form 28 such as transfers, receipts, etc., will be made whenthe transaction occurs. Check the AF Form 28 balances against the actual inventory balances monthly, toensure that accurate reporting is being made to higher headquarters. The entire balance from the previousmonth will be the beginning balance for the new month (current). Replacement of WRM rations will bemade annually. 9.6.1.  Ensure you consult with MPH to determine the proper or extended ITDs. This may require achange due to local climatic conditions and storage facilities used. If MPH evaluation requires achange to ITDs, ensure that the changes are properly recorded on AF Form 28. MPH will mark at leastfour boxes per pallet or insert at least one placard per pallet reflecting the shortened or extended ITDs.Food Service personnel must ensure MPH places a placard or stamps the required number of cases toindicate the rations were inspected. The shortened or extended ITDs must be marked on the cases orplacard. MPH will provide a letter to the FSO certifying the shortened or extended ITDs by lot num-bers. This also applies to pre-positioned WRM rations that are stored elsewhere on the base or byself-sustaining units. 9.6.2.  Post shortened or extended ITDs on the appropriate AF Form 28. 9.6.3.  Transfer operational rations to other bases at least one year before shelf life date or the mostrecent ITD. MPH inspection reports must accompany all shipments and faxed to the receiving baseand HQ AFSVA/SVOHF before shipment. 9.6.4.  Rotate operational rations by using rations for at least one meal a day during training, fieldexercises, or base alerts before shelf life date or most recent ITD. The plans officer will coordinatewith the installation commander, Services Commander, and other concerned officials for use of oper-ational rations during local exercises, alerts, ORIs, etc. 9.6.5.  Replace operational rations held by self-sustaining units annually with newer dates of packrations. 9.6.6.  Turn-in operational rations that are four years or older if un-refrigerated to the servicingDRMO. Contact HQ AFSVA/SVOHF for approval before turn-in. Rations to be turned in to DRMOmust have 90 days or more shelf life remaining at the time of turn in. 9.7.  Storage of WRM Rations. Ideally, operational rations should be stored under refrigeration(35F-50F degrees) to extend ration shelf life. In some situations, this may not be feasible and rations mustbe stored in un-refrigerated facilities. However, this decreases the shelf life when storage is above 50Fdegrees. 9.7.1.  Each MAJCOM is responsible for programming Military Construction Program (MCP)projects for storage of WRM rations and should include refrigeration to prolong ration shelf life. Iffacilities are inadequate for storage of WRM rations, the FSO must work closely with the ServicesCommander in identifying and getting adequate facilities programmed for storage of WRM rations.The same applies for Materials Handling Equipment (MHE) required. 9.7.2.  Should current facilities be inadequate for storage of WRM rations, the installation commandershould be contacted to provide space elsewhere on base to store the rations. The facility providedshould be under lock and key control of the FSO. Further, the facility must provide adequate securityAFMAN34-240   2 MAY 200535measures. If storage facility is joint use, a chain link fence must be erected from floor to ceiling to pre-vent theft of rations. 9.7.3.  Upon receipt of annual replacement rations, place the new WRM rations in WRM. Thisreplacement will also include rations issued on hand receipt to self-sustaining units. 9.7.4.  Transfer rations for medical sampling from the WRM account in full case lots. The DD Form1222, Request for And Results of Tests will be provided by MPH to Food Service personnel. 9.7.5.  Issue of rations from the WRM account will not be made. All rations for issue must be madefrom the Food Service account. If adequate rations are not available in Food Service and some WRMrations must be used, they are transferred to Food Service prior to issue. Release of WRM rations mustbe approved by the Services commander or designated representative in coordination with the baseWar Reserve Material Officer (WRMO). 9.7.6.  OCONUS bases will report quantities, which cannot be used locally to the applicable MAJ-COM. The MAJCOM will attempt to redistribute rations to other bases within their command andbudget for transportation costs for second destination movement of those rations to where they will beused. 9.7.7.  MAJCOMs will contact HQ AFSVA/SVOHF for instructions on disposition of operationalrations. The MAJCOM will attempt to redistribute operational rations to other bases within the MAJ-COM first. Rations will not be transferred from base to base without MAJCOM and HQ AFSVA/SVOHF approval and must be inspected by MPH. 9.7.8.  HQ AFSVA/SVOHF directed movement of operational rations will be transferred from theshipping Food Service account and received in the Food Service account at the receiving base. 9.8.  Accountability for Pre-positioned Rations. Accountability for pre-positioned WRM rationsremains with the FSO until they are used, lost, stolen, etc. Self-sustaining units may be authorized to storeWRM rations at certain locations. WRM rations in this category are issued on an AF Form 1297, Tempo-rary Issue Receipt, according to AFI 34-239, attachment 7. Accountability for these rations remains withthe FSO until the rations are consumed by the using activity. 9.8.1.  Operational rations should be used by the FSO for feeding one meal a day during training, fieldexercises, or during base alerts as a substitute for a flight meal or as carryout meals. 9.9.  Survival Food Packets. Survival Food Packets are not considered a WRM item. Survival foodpackets required for inclusion in survival kits aboard aircraft will not be stocked by the FSO. The usingorganizations (life support) will obtain these packets by submitting a requisition directly to DSCP. FoodService requirements for training or survival school will indicate an ESM fund cite. Quantities requestedwill be adjusted to full cases. Food packets, which are more than 48 months old from date of pack, shouldnot be issued for use in survival kits. If survival food packets are received from a DSCP depot that aremore than 48 months old (determined by the date of pack), they will be inspected by MPH for condition.Food packets in good condition will be turned into DRMO and a discrepancy report will be submitted toDSCP Operational Rations, Assembly Section, DSCP/HRAA. Dispose of food packets in unusable con-dition to refuse collection and submit a discrepancy report to DSCP/HRAA. 9.10.  Canned/Pouch Drinking Water. Canned/Pouch drinking water is not considered a WRM item.Units that require canned/pouch drinking water may submit a requisition to DSCP for the quantity of36AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 2005canned/pouch water they desire. The unit is responsible for storage. The FSO is not authorized to maintainor store canned/pouch drinking water. 9.11.  Unitized Group Rations. UGRs are the primary Air Force wartime menu and must be used duringall exercises and contingencies. Limited deviations may be authorized for those items that are out of stockin DSCP depots. Installation commanders should be made aware of this stipulation. 9.12.  Purchase of Water using O&M Monies. AFI 65-601, Vol I, 21 Oct 94, Budget Guidance andProcedures, provides direction for purchasing water. Air Force organizations may purchase drinkingwater with Appropriated Funds (O&M) only when it is a necessary expense for the government as fol-lows: 9.12.1.  The public water supply is unsafe for human consumption. 9.12.2.  There is an emergency failure of the water source on the installation. 9.12.3.  A temporary facility has no drinking water available without cost or at a lower cost to the gov-ernment. 9.12.4.  The 3500 Appropriation for Subsistence In Kind fund can only be used to support beveragesthat are part of a meal limited to 12 oz per meal. SAF/FMB ruling states that in no case should ESMfunds be used to purchase beverages for operational use, unless reimbursed. AF Flight Kitchens cansell bottled water through a bulk sale if approved for emergency purposes. The flying unit thatrequires water must have an approved funding document from the Unit Resource Advisor. The FlightKitchen will issue the water on AF Form 3516, Food Service Inventory Transfer Sheet. The FlightKitchen will attach the funding document to AF Form 3515, Cross Service Billing. This will allow thecomptroller to transfer the monies to the ESM account. AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 200537Chapter 10  BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL AND CONVENTIONAL DEFENSE OPERATION AND STANDARDS (NBCC) FOR FOOD SERVICE 10.1.  Services.  The primary focus of Services personnel is to ensure continuity of operations and toprotect personnel from contamination. Services procedures will focus on the area of food service. 10.1.1.  Food and Potable Water Considerations: 10.1.1.1.  There is currently no acceptable means to decontaminate food-packaging material.Therefore, Services personnel will take all the precautionary steps to safeguard and protect  foodassets during the pre-attack period and use existing processes to order new stocks of food 10.1.1.2.  Services personnel should disperse food assets into fixed or hardened shelters or  sealedrefrigeration units. Cover with plastic and seal with tape. Once the attack is over,  request CivilEngineer readiness to test the protected food to identify the contamination and  determine if theprotected food is contamination free. Air Force Public Health will determine  if the food is safeand wholesome for consumption. 10.1.1.3.  Institute shelter stocking with pre-positioned operational rations, such as MealsReady-to-Eat (MRE) nad Unitized Group Rations (UGR). Stock only those shelters in an overpressurized environment (personnel can safely remove mask). 10.1.1.4.  Upon notification of hostilities, work the normal food supply chain to immediatelyrestock and resupply sustaining forces with either in-theater or out of theater clean food assets.  Toaccomplish this MAJCOM and Services Agency staff will work with in-theater personnel todetermine salvageable and reusable assets and to reorder requirements for MRE and UGR. 10.1.1.5.  Do not use contaminated food service equipment. Instead, relocate new bare base  assetsfrom other sites within the theater or from stateside locations. Until that time, personnel  will eatclean operational rations. 10.1.1.6.  If new science and/or technologies permit the safe decontamination of certain foodpackaging systems; revise decontamination procedures accordingly. 38AFMAN34-240   2 MAY 2005Chapter 11  FORMS 11.1.
