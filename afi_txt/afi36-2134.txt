Strength  accounting duty status program reporting assists commanders in supporting peace and wartime  mission  requirements.    The  availability  of  strength  accounting  duty  status  information allows commanders and functional managers to make informed force management decisions by providing  quick  and  accurate  determination  of  names,  numbers,  and  types  of  unit  personnel available  for  mission  taskings.    Strength  accounting  duty  status  reporting  is  event-oriented  and serves  as  a  personnel  accounting  function.    Strength  accounting  duty  status  conditions  are reported when an individual is projected to be or is in a strength accounting duty status condition other than Present For Duty (PFD), as well as when he/she is subsequently returned to PFD per Air  Force  Computer  System  Manual  (AFCSM)  36-699,  Military  Personnel  Data  System (MilPDS)  User  Guide,  Volume  1,  Chapter  13  or  AFI  36-2911,  Desertion  and  Unauthorized Absence.

Purpose.  The  Air  Force  Strength  Accounting  Duty  Status  Program  (SADSP)  exists  to enhance  total  force  accountability  and  improve  crisis  responsiveness.    The  SADSP  allows  all levels of command to access and maintain a centralized database depicting the current status of the force and is designed to provide commanders, planners, and managers with strength-affecting information. It encompasses all events causing a person to not be PFD.  This data can be used in making force management decisions.  The SADSP is also a primary conduit for data impacting Air  Force  personnel  tempo  (PERSTEMPO)  and  the  payment  of  high-deployment  pay (Burdensome  Tempo).    Note:    Effective  8  October  2001,  the  Deputy  Secretary  Defense suspended  the  accumulation  of  deployment  days  for  the  purpose  of  determining  eligibility  for high deployment per diem until further notice. 1.2.  Objective.  The objective of the SADSP is to capture and report all changes in a member’s strength  accounting  duty  status  to  ensure  these  changes,  regardless  of  length  are  reported immediately.    Specifically,  the  SADSP  provides  a  mechanism  for  Commanders  and  Military Personnel  Section  (MPS)  personnel  to  update  data  through  Military  Personnel  Data  System (MilPDS). 1.3.  Uses.  Strength  accounting  duty  status  is  much  more  than  a  process  to  identify  the availability or non-availability of personnel for duty.  Commanders and agencies throughout the Air  Force  and  the  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  rely  on  information  derived  from  strength accounting duty status reporting to fulfill mission needs.  The importance of accurate and timely reporting must not be downplayed. Strength accounting duty status information is used: 1.3.1.  To document the utilization of Guard and Reserve personnel. This information affects man-day funding. 1.3.2.  To prevent the selection for assignment of deployed personnel who are non-volunteers for assignment. 1.3.3.  To  create  the  transaction  that  causes  the  Overseas  Duty  Selection  Date  (ODSD)  and Short Tour Return Date (STRD) to be adjusted for each day spent on Temporary Duty (TDY) in an overseas area. 1.3.4.  To  manage  PERSTEMPO  and  to  determine  the  Operation  Tempo  (OPSTEMPO)  of wings, units, weapons systems, and Air Force Specialty’s (AFSs).  Strength accounting duty status  updates  trigger  the  transaction  that  creates  a  record  within  the  TDY  history.    This transaction is used in the management of PERSTEMPO and has a direct impact on unit and individual  credit  for  deployment.    Senior  leaders  use  the  SADSP  data  to  help  gauge  the effects continual TDYs have on unit readiness and individual quality of life. 1.3.5.  To change service dates, pay dates, military pay, lost time, retirement and separation dates, dates of rank, ODSDs, STRDs, promotion eligibility, and reenlistment eligibility when a member is placed into a unfavorable code:  confinement, absence without leave (AWOL), deserter, etc. AFI36-2134  4 AUGUST 2014   7  1.3.6.  To  comply  with  DoD  requirements  to  provide  the  Defense  Manpower  Data  Center (DMDC) information on all TDYs performed.  DMDC uses Service-supplied data to report PERSTEMPO  to  the  Undersecretary  of  Defense  for  Personnel  and  Readiness.    This  data informs the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) which Services are the busiest in terms of time away from home station. 1.3.7.  To  calculate  unit  personnel  Category  levels,  or  C-levels  in  Status  of  Resources  and Training Systems (SORTS). 1.3.8.  To identify the availability of personnel to meet combatant commander requirements. 1.3.9.  To  identify  personnel  who  are  projected  to  deploy  or  already  deployed  to  support combatant commander requirements.   8  AFI36-2134  4 AUGUST 2014 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  2.1.

Purpose.  Changes in strength accounting duty status must be updated as they occur.  The DD  Form  2707,  Confinement  Order,  is  the  source  document  to  initiate  the  strength  accounting duty  status  via  CMS,  to  change  the  member’s  strength  accounting  duty  status  to  a  military confinement  strength  accounting  duty  status.    See  Personnel  Service  Delivery  Duty  Status Procedures for CMS Updates Training Tool Guide located on AFPC website. 3.2.  Background.  This  chapter  provides  information  on  Confinement,  AWOL,  and  Deserter Status.  Confinement, AWOL, and deserter strength accounting duty status conditions may result in lost time.  It details procedures for the capture and reporting of these strength accounting duty status  conditions.    NOTE:    Air  Force  Missing  Persons  Branch  (AFPC/DPWCM)  will  update strength  accounting  duty  status  in  MilPDS  for  AWOL,  Deserter  and  civilian/military confinement as a result of AWOL/Deserter strength accounting duty status. 3.3.  Confinement, AWOL, and Deserter strength accounting duty status Procedures. 3.3.1.  Confinement.  Confinement strength accounting duty status is reported IAW AFI 31-205, the Air Force Corrections System, and DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 7A. 3.3.1.1.  Notify  appropriate agency of strength  accounting duty status  Codes 04, 05, 16, 17, 56, or 59, as applicable, when a member has been confined for 24 hours or more. 3.3.1.2.  When  a  member  is  confined  by  civil  authorities  or  under  arrest,  pending  trial, awaiting sentencing, or out of jail on bond and restricted to the state while on approved leave, the member may continue on leave until the original expiration date of leave unless recalled to duty by the commander IAW AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program.  If still confined after expiration of leave, the member’s strength accounting duty status must be updated to a civilian confinement code of 04, 05, or 56 effective the day after the leave expiration date.   (NOTE:    If a member is  placed into pre-trial  confinement  while under civilian  control  either  under  arrest,  pending  trial,  awaiting  sentencing,  or  out  of  jail  on bond while restricted to the state and is then sentenced to confinement, a new AF Form 2098 and/or CMS case  must be completed to change the member’s strength  accounting duty status from 04 to 05 or 56.  When a member is sentenced to civil confinement, the length of confinement determines if the member will be dropped from unit manning.  If the  sentence  is  for  6  months  or  more,  whether  by  foreign  or  U.S.  civil  court,  member should  drop  from  unit  manning.    If  the  sentence  is  less  than  6  months,  member  will remain on the unit manning roster.)  (See Attachment 7). 3.3.1.3.  When  a  member  is  placed  into  military  confinement,  either  pre-trial  or  as  the result of a court-martial  sentence  (strength  accounting duty status  Codes 16, 17, or 59), the  unit  commander  must  sign  a  DD  Form  2707,  provided  by  the  local  confinement officer.  The confinement order is the source document used to initiate the AF Form 2098 and/or  CMS  case.    (NOTE:    If  a  member  is  put  into  pre-trial  confinement  and  is  then sentenced  by  court-martial  to  confinement,  a  new  confinement  order  will  be  published   14  AFI36-2134  4 AUGUST 2014 and  a  new  AF  Form  2098  and/or  CMS  must  be  completed  to  change  the  strength accounting duty status from 16 to 17 or 59). 3.3.1.4.  If  the  accused  was  in  continuous  pre-trial  confinement  from  the  confinement date until the adjudgment date, an AF Form 1359, Report of Result of Trial, can serve in lieu of the confinement order. 3.3.1.5.  Court-Martial Sentences With Less Than 12 Months of Confinement Time IAW AFI 31-205: 3.3.1.5.1.  For court-martial sentences with less than 12 months of confinement time, the  member  may  serve  all  or  part  of  his/her  confinement  locally.    Any  reduction  in grade  due  to  the  court-martial  requires  coordination  with  the  appropriate  AFPC, ARPC and NGB promotions office.  An AF IMT 1359, Report of Result of Trial, will be  published,  listing  all  the  charges  and  findings  of  each  charge,  to  include  the sentence.  If a sentence includes a punitive discharge, the MPS Personnel Relocations Element  will  update  a  request  for  separation  in  MilPDS.    The  requested  separation date  will  be  “08-Aug-3888”  and  the  RET-SEP-ID  will  be  “S”  with  the  appropriate Separation Designator (SPD) Code. 3.3.1.5.2.  When  a  member’s  sentence  is  less  than  12  months  and  the  local confinement  facility  cannot  accommodate  the  member  or  the  Convening  Authority (CA) has not acted on the case, the member may be transferred by Permanent Change of  Station  (PCS)  without  Permanent  Change  of  Assignment  (PCA)  to  a  regional corrections  facility  managed  by  the  HQ  Air  Force  Security  Forces  Center  (HQ AFSFC),  Lackland  AFB,  Texas  (DSN  945-5608/5616).    If  the  CA  has  acted  on  the case, the member will then be PCSd with PCA, and HQ AFSFC/SFC will force gain the member and assume administrative control.  When an officer is  court-martialed, the  confinement  will  be  served  at  the  United  States  Disciplinary  Barracks,  Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, unless dictated otherwise. 3.3.1.6.  Court-Martial Sentences With 12 Months or More Confinement Time IAW AFI 31-205,  The  Air  Force  Corrections  System.    HQ  AFSFC  will  normally  assign  the member PCS with PCA to a DoD regional correctional facility once the CA acts on the case.    The  member  will  be  physically  transferred  and  administratively  assigned  to  HQ AFSFC.    The  local  confinement  officer  will  send  a  message  to  HQ  AFSFC  requesting transfer  of  the  member.    HQ  AFSFC  will  respond  by  message  with  further  transfer instructions  and  assignment  procedures  to  the  local  MPS  and  the  gaining  correctional facility.    Prior  to  a  member  being  transferred  to  a  DoD  regional  correctional  facility, ensure  his/her  strength  accounting  duty  status  is  updated  to  17  (Sentenced  Military Prisoner).  NOTE:  Any reduction in grade due to the court-martial requires coordination with the appropriate AFPC, ARPC and NGB promotions office. 3.3.1.7.  When updating strength accounting duty status Code 05 (Civilian Confinement, Sentenced  Prisoner)  or  17  (Military  Confinement,  Sentenced  Prisoner),  ensure  the expiration date is  correct.    If  a member receives  a sentence of 5  years confinement,  the strength  accounting  duty  status  expiration  date  should  reflect  a  date  5  years  from  the adjudgment  date--the  expiration  date  may  change  based  upon  the  member’s  ultimate release date. AFI36-2134  4 AUGUST 2014   15  3.3.1.8.  For strength  accounting duty status Codes 04 (Civilian, Pre-Trial Confinement) and  16  (Military,  Pre-Trial  Confinement),  the  system  automatically  suspenses  strength accounting  duty  status  expiration  for  30  days  from  the  effective  date.    A  Transaction Register (TR) notice will be produced prior to the expiration date.  This can be extended in  15-day  increments.    If  the  strength  accounting  duty  status  code  remains  expired  for more than 15 days, the system will not allow further updates.  The member will have  to be brought back to strength accounting duty status Code 00 and a lost time update of zero days must be entered.  Update the member again into the appropriate strength accounting duty status code with the original effective date and a future expiration date 15 days from the date of this latest update. 3.3.1.9.  When  going  from  one  unfavorable  strength  accounting  duty  status  code  to another, for example strength accounting duty status Code 16 (Pre-Trial Confinement) to strength accounting duty status Code 17 (Military Confinement, Sentenced Prisoner), do not bring the member back to strength accounting duty status Code 00 (PFD).  If brought back to strength accounting duty status Code 00, a lost time update will have to be done. 3.3.2.  Absent  without  Leave  (AWOL).    AWOL  strength  accounting  duty  status  is  reported IAW AFI 36-2911, Desertion and Unauthorized Absence. 3.3.2.1.  For a member to be placed into an AWOL strength  accounting  duty status,  the member  must  be  in  an  unauthorized  absence  status  for  more  than  24  hours.    An unauthorized  absence  begins  when  a  member  is  absent  from  where  they  are  ordered  or otherwise required to be present.  For an unauthorized absence of more than 24 hours and less  than  30  days,  classify  as  AWOL  or  Deserter  (See  paragraph  3.3.3  for  the  Deserter process). 3.3.2.2.  When updating AWOL or deserter strength accounting duty status Code 07, the strength accounting duty status expiration date is automatically projected to 30 days from the effective date. 3.3.2.3.  On the 31st day of AWOL,  a TR  remark will be generated stating the member has been AWOL for 30  days or more, verifying  the status  and updating the appropriate strength  accounting  duty  status  code.    A  new  AF  Form  2098  and/or  CMS  must  be accomplished  when  going  from  strength  accounting  duty  status  Code  07  (AWOL)  to strength accounting duty status Code 06 (Deserter). 3.3.3.  Deserter.    Deserter  strength  accounting  duty  status  is  reported  IAW  AFI  36-2911, Desertion  and  Unauthorized  Absence.    A  member  does  not  have  to  be  placed  in  AWOL status  prior  to  being  declared  a  deserter.    Commanders  should  place  members  in  deserter status  if  the  member  is  AWOL  for  any  amount  of  time  and  meets  any  of  the  following criteria: 3.3.3.1.  Is  under  duty  or  travel  restrictions  imposed  by  DoDI  5200.02/AFI  31-501, Personnel Security Program Management. 3.3.3.2.  Has  had  access  within  the  past  12  months  to  Top  Secret  information  or  other classified  information  that  requires  special  access  authority  (see  AFI  36-2911,  table  1, paragraph 1.5.2.2.).  DO NOT classify a person who appears to be more a casualty than a deserter solely because the person has had access to classified material described herein.   16  AFI36-2134  4 AUGUST 2014 3.3.3.3.  Has  gone  to  or  stayed  in  a  foreign  country  and,  while  there,  has  asked  for  or taken  any  type  of  asylum  or  resident  permit  from  that  country  or  its  governmental agencies. 3.3.3.4.  Has a previous unauthorized absence pending that has not been completed. 3.3.3.5.  Is an escaped prisoner. 3.3.3.6.  Is  under  investigation  for  violating  articles  of  the  Uniformed  Code  of  Military Justice (UCMJ) as specified in AFI 36-2911, attachment 4, or against whom charges for any offense have been referred to a General Court-Martial. 3.3.3.7.  Is determined by HQ AFPC/DPWCM to be in a deserter status. 3.3.3.8.  Goes or remains absent from his/her unit, organization, or place of duty with the intent to remain away permanently. 3.3.3.9.  When  updating  deserter  strength  accounting  duty  status  Code  06,  the  strength accounting  duty  status  expiration  date  is  automatically  projected  to  179  days  from  the effective date. 3.3.3.10.  An unauthorized absence ends when the absentee or deserter returns to military control.  AFPC/DPWCM will update MilPDS with a strength accounting duty status code returning the member to military control IAW AFI 36-2911. 3.3.3.11.  Correctional  custody  is  non-judicial  punishment  commanders  can  impose  for minor offenses.  Correctional custody is not confinement and time served in correctional custody is not lost time.  The strength accounting duty status code for a member placed in correctional  custody  will  be  00  (PFD).    For  those  installations  that  do  not  have  a correctional  custody facility and member will be placed into one at  another installation, place the member in strength accounting duty status Code 14 (Not PFD - Other). 3.4.  Lost Time. 3.4.1.  Definition.    Any  time  a  member  (enlisted  or  officer)  spends  in  AWOL  status, desertion, or any confinement whether it is pre or post-trial confinement status is considered non-creditable service--also referred to as lost time or “bad" time.  When lost time is charged, a member’s service dates are adjusted forward by the number of days of lost time charged. 3.4.1.1.    Time spent in confinement is considered to be non-creditable service and must be charged as lost time (DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 7A, table 1.1. and 10 USC  §  972).    EXCEPTION:    If  the  member  is  released  without  trial,  acquitted,  or  the conviction  is  set  aside  on  legal  grounds,  please  contact  the  Total  Force  Service  Center (AFPC/DPTSO) at DSN 665-5000. 3.4.1.2.  Do not return a member to strength accounting duty status Code 00 when going from  one  unfavorable  strength  accounting  duty  status  to  another  (e.g.,  Pretrial Confinement to Sentenced Prisoner). 3.4.1.3.  Enlisted  members  can  only  be  charged  lost  time  for  the  period  of  their enlistment.  (e.g.,  if  a  member  has  2  years  left  on  a  4-year  enlistment  when  they  go AWOL  and are  apprehended 4  years later, they  can only be charged lost time for the 2 years they had remaining on their enlistment). AFI36-2134  4 AUGUST 2014   17  3.4.1.4.  When calculating lost time, the day a member enters into a unfavorable strength accounting  duty  status,  regardless  of  the  hour,  is  considered  unfavorable.    The  day  a member is returned to a “good” strength accounting duty status, regardless of the hour, is considered “good.” 3.4.2.  Updating Lost Time: 3.4.2.1.  MilPDS  will  automatically  generate  a  lost  time  update  to  the  lost  time application, only when the member is returned to a present for strength accounting duty status.    The  completion  of  an  AF  IMT  2098  and/or  a  CMS  case  with  the  appropriate signatures is required for members returning from a unfavorable strength accounting duty status (see Attachment 5).  The number of days lost time is determined by the from and thru  dates.    MilPDS  will  not  count  the  day  an  individual  is  returned  to  duty  or  military control as lost time. 3.4.2.1.1.  The  same  day  lost  time  has  been  updated  in  MilPDS,  TR  notices  will  be generated  and  a  Service  Date  Adjustment  Report  Individual  Person  (RIP)  will  be produced, showing the member’s old service dates as well as the new adjusted ones.  This  RIP  must  be  filed  in  the  member’s  Automated  Records  Management  System (ARMS) along with applicable AF Form 2098 and/or CMS file.  The RIP will serve as  the  source  document  for  the  new  service  dates  as  it  will  be  needed  if  any corrections to  the lost time update need to  be made.  The service dates listed below are  automatically  adjusted  with  a  lost  time  update  and  reported  to  Defense  Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) and MilPDS: 3.4.2.1.1.1.  Pay Date. 3.4.2.1.1.2.  Total Active Federal Military Service Date (TAFMSD). 3.4.2.1.1.3.  Total Enlisted Military Service Date (TEMSD). 3.4.2.1.1.4.  Date of Separation (DOS). 3.4.2.1.1.5.  Expiration Term of Service (ETS). 3.4.2.1.1.6.  Grade Current Date of Rank (DOR). 3.4.2.1.1.7.  Overseas Duty Selection Date (ODSD). 3.4.2.1.1.8.  Short Tour Return Date (STRD). 3.4.2.1.1.9.  Lost Days Current Enlistment. 3.4.2.1.1.10.  Absent Days After ETS. 3.4.2.1.1.11.  Active Duty Service Commitment Date (ADSCD). 3.4.2.1.1.12.  Since  MilPDS  automatically  adjusts  lost  time  once  a  member  is returned  PFD,  for  any  unauthorized  absence  (AWOL  or  Desertion),  if  the  unit commander  has  not  made  a  determination  once  he/she  has  investigated  the circumstances  involving  the  member’s  absence  and  determines  the  cause,  a  lost time  determination  must  be  made.    If  the  commander  decides  to  not  charge  the member lost time, delete the lost time from the lost time application in MilPDS.    18  AFI36-2134  4 AUGUST 2014 3.5.  Officer Strength Accounting Duty Status Procedures: 3.5.1.  Officer  lost  time procedures  apply  to  all  RegAF  officers,  Reserve  and  ANG  officers on extended active duty tours (Title 10).  The 1996 Defense Authorization Act amendments changed the law concerning lost time for officers.  United States Code, Title 10, Section 972 states:    “An  officer  who  after  February  10,  1996,  deserts,  is  absent  from  his  organization, station  or  place  of  duty  for  more  than  one  day  without  proper  authority,  is  confined  by military or civilian authorities for more than one day, or in connection with a trial, whether before, during, or after the trial or is unable to perform duties because of intemperate use of drugs  or  alcohol  because  of  disease  or  injury  resulting  from  misconduct  as  determined  by competent authority, will not receive service credit for lost time.  However, the lost time will not affect the officer’s basic pay for years of service under Section 205 of Title 37.” 3.5.2.  Generally, documentation of lost time is done electronically.  Currently MilPDS does not  allow  for  a  lost  time  update  to  be  made  on  an  officer.    Therefore,  compliance  with  the guidance is mandatory. 3.5.3.  Placing  an  Officer  into  Military/Civilian  Confinement,  Deserter,  AWOL,  strength accounting duty status (04, 05, 06, 07, 16, 17, 52, 56, 59): 3.5.3.1.  For  RegAF  Members:    The  original  AF  Form  2098  and/or  CMS  case  will  be loaded into ARMS upon completion of CMS case. 3.5.3.2.  For Unit Reserve, Unit AGR, and ANG Members:  The original AF Form 2098 and/or  CMS  will  be  processed  by  the  Reserve/ANG  MPS  and  forwarded  with  proper coordination  as  outlined  in  attachment  5  to  ARPC  Contact  Center  through  the  Virtual Personnel Center-Guard Reserve (vPC-GR Online) (for Air National Guard of the United States  (ANGUS)  members)  and  the  Personnel  Employment  Branch,  AFRC/DPMF,  155 Richard Ray Blvd, Robins AFB GA 31098-1635 (for USAFR members). 3.5.3.3.  For IMA and HQ AGR Members:  The original AF Form 2098 and/or CMS will be processed by the active duty unit SADSP manager or MPS as outlined in attachment 5 and  forwarded  with  proper  coordination  to  ARPC  Contact  Center  through  the  Virtual Personnel Center-Guard Reserve (vPC-GR Online) (for Air National Guard of the United States  (ANGUS)  members)  and  the  Personnel  Employment  Branch,  AFRC/DPMF,  155 Richard Ray Blvd, Robins AFB GA 31098-1635 (for USAFR members). 3.5.3.4.  For USAFA Cadets:  The original AF Form 2098 and/or CMS will be processed by  the  active  duty  unit  SADSP  manager  or  MPS  and  forwarded  to  AFPC/DPWCM  or DPTSO as appropriate. 3.5.4.  To Return an Officer to Present for strength accounting duty status (Code 00): 3.5.4.1.  A second original AF Form 2098 and/or CMS will be accomplished.  This new form will be processed by the MPS with proper coordination and must contain a lost time determination  made  by  the  unit  commander,  as  outlined  in  attachment  5.    Forward  the completed  form  to  AFPC/DPSIPV.    AFPC/DPSIPV  will  update  the  TAFSMD,  Total Active Federal Commissioned Service Date (TAFCSD), and adjust ADSC (if necessary) to reflect the number of lost days and will adjust 10 USC § 1405 Service Date.  For lost time purposes, the 1405 service date will only be computed if the individual is at the 18-AFI36-2134  4 AUGUST 2014   19  year mark.  HQ AFPC/DPSIPV will also forward the AF Form 2098 to AFPC/DPAPP1 for adjustment of ODSD and STRD. 3.5.4.2.  Once adjustments have been made, AFPC/DPSIPV will forward the original AF Form 2098 and/or CMS to AFPC/DPSIR. 3.5.4.3.  For  Unit  Reserve,  Unit  AGR,  and  ANG  Members:    The  Reserve  MPS  must complete the AF Form  2098 and/or CMS as outlined in  attachment 5, and forward it to ARPC  Contact  Center  through  the  vPC-GR  Online  (for  ANGUS  members)  and  the Personnel  Employment  Branch,  Air  Force  Reserve  Command,  HQ  AFRC/DPMF,  155 Richard Ray Blvd, Robins AFB GA 31098-1635 (for USAFR members). 3.5.4.4.  For  IMA  and  HQ  AGR  Reserve  members  serviced  by  an  active  duty  unit  or MPS, the AF Form 2098 and/or CMS must be completed as outlined in attachment 5, and forwarded to Military Personnel Division, Air National Guard, NGB/A1PR, 3500 Fetchet Avenue,  Joint  Base  Andrews  MD20762  (for  ANGUS  members)  and  the  Personnel Employment Branch, Air Force Reserve Command, HQ AFRC/DPMF, 155 Richard Ray Blvd, Robins AFB GA 31098-1635 (for USAFR members). 3.6.  Return to Military Control: 3.6.1.  Every effort should be made to update strength accounting duty status changes when they occur.  When a member’s strength accounting duty status changes to other than PFD to military  or  civilian  confinement  and  returns  back  to  PFD  before  any  updates  have  been accomplished,  do  not  update  the  system  with  the  past  strength  accounting  duty  status,  DO update the lost time application to reflect the applicable amount of days lost, the application will  not  automatically  update  because  a  strength  accounting  duty  status  update  was  not completed.    If  the  strength  accounting  duty  status  change  should  be  AWOL  or  Desertion, please contact AFPC/DPWCM for instructions.  Ensure all applicable AF IMT  2098 and/or CMS  cases  are  accomplished,  coordinated  on  and  properly  distributed  in  accordance  with this AFI. 3.6.2.  Return of a Member from AWOL, Desertion, or Confinement Status After ETS (IAW DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 7A): 3.6.2.1.  A  member  who  is  in  an  AWOL  or  deserter  status  and  surrenders  or  is apprehended  after  the  ETS  has  expired  is  NOT  entitled  to  pay  and  allowances  until restored to full strength accounting duty status (PFD) for the purpose of making good the lost time. 3.6.2.2.  The  following  applies  if  a  situation  warrants  a  member’s  expired  ETS  to  be made current: 3.6.2.2.1.  When a member is returned to duty from AWOL, deserter or confinement status,  the  ETS/DOS  has  expired,  and  court-martial  actions  are  pending,  the ETS/DOS can be involuntarily extended in 3-month increments. 3.6.2.2.2.  When a member is returned to duty from AWOL, deserter or confinement status, the ETS/DOS has expired and no court-martial actions are pending, there are two ways the ETS/DOS can be extended depending on the situation. 3.6.2.2.2.1.  If the amount of lost time to be updated would extend the member’s current ETS/DOS into the future, update the lost time in MilPDS.   20  AFI36-2134  4 AUGUST 2014 3.6.2.2.2.2.  If  the  amount  of  lost  time  to  be  updated  would  not  extend  the member’s ETS/DOS into the future, the ETS/DOS can be extended from the date the member is returned to duty by the amount of lost time incurred to date.  For example, a member enlists for 4 years on 1 Jan 90.  On 1 Jan 92, the member goes AWOL  and  is  apprehended  by  military  authorities  on  1  Jan  97,  and  placed  into pre-trial  confinement.    Update  MilPDS  to  adjust  the  member’s  ETS/DOS  and other service dates by the amount of time left on the member’s enlistment prior to going  AWOL.    In  this  case,  2  years  forward  from  1  Jan  97;  the  member’s  new ETS/DOS  would  be  31  Dec  99.    Ensure  all  applicable  AF  Forms  2098  and/or CMS are accomplished and filed.  NOTE:  When the ETS/DOS is extended this way, do not update the lost time in MilPDS.  Ensure the member’s DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty, is  annotated with correct lost time and service dates. 3.7.  Appellate Review Leave: 3.7.1.  After a member’s court-martial or confinement has been completed, and if part of the sentence  included  a  dismissal  or  punitive  discharge  and  the  legal  reviews  on  the  case  have not yet been finalized, the member will then be put on appellate review leave to await legal review results.  Appellate review leave is directed by the convening authority (CA) in writing and  will  be  included  in  the  initial  court-martial  order.    While  on  appellate  review  leave,  a member will use up accrued leave before entering into an excess leave status, at which time the member is still considered to be in the Air Force, but in a no-pay status.  An excess leave status will begin the day after accrued leave ends. 3.7.2.  If a member was transferred to a DoD regional correctional facility and was assigned PCS with PCA, HQ AFSFC will accomplish all appellate review actions. 3.7.3.  If  a  member’s  confinement  has  been  completed  and  the  initial  court-martial  order directing  appellate  review  has  not  been  published,  the  member  will  be  returned  to  his/her original  unit  or  a  transition  flight  until  the  court-martial  order  directing  appellate  review leave is received.  The member’s strength accounting duty status Code will be 00. 3.7.4.  Until the member departs the base on appellate review leave, the strength accounting duty  status  Code  will  be  00  to  include  any  time  spent  out-processing.  The  strength accounting  duty  status  code  update  for  appellate  review  is  a  programmatic  update  from DFAS.    For  this  update  to  process,  the  member  must  be  in  strength  accounting  duty  status Code 00. 3.7.5.  Appellate  Review  Leave  Processing  Procedures  (Member  Assigned  Within  the Continental United States [CONUS]): 3.7.5.1.  Losing MPS:  Upon completion of a court-martial, AF IMT 1359 will be filled out listing all the charges and the findings of each charge to include the sentence.  If the sentence  includes  a  punitive  discharge,  the  Separations  Office  will  update  a  request  for separation  in  MilPDS.    The  requested  separation  will  be  “08-Aug-3888”  and  the  RET-SEP-ID will be “S” with appropriate Separation Designator (SPD) Code. 3.7.5.2.  Once the court-martial order has been published by Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) directing a member on appellate review leave, the member must out-process through all applicable  base  agencies.    All  separation  actions  IAW  AFI  36-2102,  Base  Level AFI36-2134  4 AUGUST 2014   21  Relocation  Procedures,  will  be  completed.    DD  Form  214,  and  AF  Form  100,  Request and Authorization for Separation, will not be completed until the final court-martial order is received. 3.7.5.2.1.  Losing Unit:  The member’s unit will accomplish an AF Form 988, Leave Request/Authorization Form,  with  an expiration  date of 300 days from the effective date.  An AF Form 988 used for appellate review leave will be processed differently from a normal leave form; contact the local finance office for specific procedures, as a  member  being  placed  on  appellate  review  leave  has  several  options  concerning leave and pay.  Ensure the local finance office counsels the member concerning these options. 3.7.5.2.2.  Losing Comptroller Office:  The losing Comptroller office will process the AF  Form  988,  in  turn  flowing  a  transaction  to  the  base-level  MilPDS  updating  the member’s strength accounting duty status Code to 52 (Appellate Review). 3.7.5.3.  Losing MPS:  When the member’s strength accounting duty status Code changes to 52, the member’s record status will change from 10 to 82.  Close coordination with the local Comptroller office is crucial at this point.  The Comptroller office records the exact day  a  member  will  enter  into  excess  leave  (strength  accounting  duty  status  Code  52); therefore, confirm this date with Comptroller office.  If more than 5 days elapse from the date given by the Comptroller Office, and the member’s strength accounting duty status Code has not changed to 52 and the current strength  accounting duty status Code is 00, update  the  member’s  strength  accounting  duty  status  Code  manually  in  MilPDS  to  52 with an expiration date of 300 days from the start date. 3.7.5.3.1.  The  Losing  MPS  will  maintain  a  file  copy  of  any  supporting  documents until  the  final  court-martial  order  is  received  from  the  CA  stating  disposition  of  the member’s  case.    NOTE:    Legal  review  can  take  from  1  –  3  years  to  complete.  Member’s case should be reviewed with Legal every 300 days to see if the member’s case has been completed.  IF NOT, the member’s expiration date in MilPDS will need to be extended out another 300 days; a new AF IMT 988 will be needed as a source document to extend member’s appellate review leave out for an additional 300 days.  The  member’s  home  base  remains  administratively  responsible  regardless  of  the member’s leave address.  DO NOT assign the member PCS to the base closest to the leave address.   Upon receipt of the final  court-martial  order approving the members discharge,  the  Separations  Office  will  confirm  the  member’s  separation  in  MilPDS and  DFAS  files.    Dispose  of  the  case  file  in  accordance  with  Air  Force  Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Disposition  Schedule  (RDS)  located  in  the  Air  Force  Records  Information Management  System  (AFRIMS)  and  AFI  36-2608,  Military  Personnel  Records System, table A6.4. 3.7.6.  Appellate Review Leave Processing Procedures (Member Assigned Overseas): 3.7.6.1.  Losing  MPS:    Upon  completion  of  a  court-martial,  an  AF  IMT  1359  will  be published.  Use the AF IMT 1359 as the source document, and if the sentence includes a punitive discharge, the Separations Office will update a request for separation in MilPDS.  The requested separation date will be “08-Aug-3888” and the  RET-SEP-ID will be “S” with appropriate Separation Designator (SPD) Code.  On receipt of the published court-  22  AFI36-2134  4 AUGUST 2014 martial order directing a member to be placed on appellate review leave, the MPS sends a message  requesting  assignment  instructions:    For  enlisted  assignment  instructions,  the message  will  be  sent  to  AFPC/DPAA;  For  officer  assignment  instructions,  the  message will  be  sent  to  AFPC/DPAPP2.    Information  addressees  will  include  the  losing MAJCOM and AFLOA/JAJM, JB Andrews, MD.  In the message, include the member’s full  name,  grade,  SSN,  Control  Air  Force  Specialty  Code  (CAFSC),  Primary  Air  Force Specialty  Code  (PAFSC),  Date  Eligible  to  Return  from  Overseas  (DEROS),  Assigned Personnel  Accounting  Symbol  (PAS)  Code,  complete  leave  address,  home  of  record (HOR), type of discharge, court-martial order number including the date, and the date the member’s confinement will be completed.  AFPC/DPAA will respond by return message only  (you  will  not  receive  an  in-system  assignment  notification).    The  member  will  be assigned to the MPS closest to the member’s leave address.  Upon receipt of instructions from  AFPC,  schedule  member  for  out-processing  as  soon  as  possible.    Any  member placed  on  appellate  review  leave  does  not  report  to  gaining  unit.    Mail  the  military member’s records to the gaining unit along with AF IMT 988 completed by the member’s losing unit, including leave number and showing a period of 300 days.  Upon arrival at the appellate review leave address, the member will mail a completed travel voucher, DD Form  1351-2,  Travel  Voucher  or  Subvoucher,  to  the  gaining  Comptroller  office.    The record remains on the overseas location file until the member is placed into excess leave status by the losing Comptroller office. 3.7.6.2.  Losing  Comptroller  office:    Accomplish  notification  of  required  excess  leave and  endorsements  before  the  member  departs  the  overseas  base,  but  not  until  after  the member  enters  into  an  excess  leave  status  IAW  DFAS-DEM  7073-2,  Unit  Leave Procedures, paragraph C7.11.2.5.  The losing Comptroller office processes the AF Form 988, in turn flowing a transaction to MilPDS updating the member’s strength accounting duty status to “52” (Appellate Review Leave). 3.7.6.3.  Losing MPS:  After processing AF IMT 988, close coordination with your local Comptroller  office  is  crucial.    Finance  records  the  exact  day  a  member  will  enter  into excess  leave  status;  confirm  this  date  with  the  Comptroller  office.    If  more  than  5  days elapse  from  the  date  given  by  the  Comptroller  office,  and  the  member’s  strength accounting duty status Code has not changed to “52,” and the current strength accounting duty  status  Code  is  “00,”  update  the  member’s  strength  accounting  duty  status  Code manually in MilPDS to “52” with an expiration date of 300 days from the start date. 3.7.6.4.  Gaining MPS:  The gaining Separations Office only maintains the case file until legal review is completed. The gaining MPS does not force gain the person to file.  The member’s  record  remains  in  MilPDS  until  notification  the  appellate  review  case  is complete.    NOTE:    Legal  review  can  take  from  1-3  years  to  complete.   Member’s  case should have been completed.  IF NOT, then the member’s expiration date in MilPDS will need to  be  extended out  another 300 days, and  a  new AF  IMT 988  will be needed as  a source  document  to  extend  member’s  appellate  review  out  for  an  additional  300  days.  After the appellate review is completed, the MPS should receive the general court martial order  affirming  the  separation.    The  MPS  will  then  complete  the  DD  Form  214, Certificate  of  Release  or  Discharge  from  Active  Duty.    The  separation  date  will  be  the same date the DD Form 214 is completed; only then will the Separations Office complete the separation action and member’s record in MilPDS be removed. AFI36-2134  4 AUGUST 2014   23  3.7.6.5.  Every  120  days,  the  local  finance  office  will  verify  the  member  is  still  on appellate review leave and will re-update the finance system accordingly.  Upon receipt of  a  RIP  (generated  every  90  days),  Personnel  Relocations/Employment  will  verify  the member’s  status  with  the  unit,  or  base  legal  office.    If  the  member  is  still  on  appellate review  leave  and  the  strength  accounting  duty  status  expiration  date  on  the  RIP  has expired, extend the expiration date by 300 days.   24  AFI36-2134  4 AUGUST 2014 Chapter 4 NON-CONTINGENCY TDY STRENGTH ACCOUNTING DUTY STATUS REPORTING PROCEDURES, MISCELLANEOUS UPDATES, AND PERSTEMPO TRACKING AND MANAGEMENT  4.1.  Purpose.  The  SADSP  is  the  unit  commander’s  responsibility;  it  is  event-oriented  which encompasses  numerous  and  varied  types  of  strength  accounting  duty  status  conditions.  Information  in  this  chapter  is  provided  to  assist  in  the  management  and  update  of  non-contingency TDY strength accounting duty status conditions and conditions not clearly reflected in attachment 2. 4.2.  Background.  The  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  of  2000  requires  all  Services  to track,  manage,  and  report  high-deployment  events.    Service  secretaries  are  directed  to  pay service members high-deployment per diem of $100 a day for each day a member is deployed in excess of 401 days out of the previous 730-day period.  In addition, the Office of the Secretary of Defense  (OSD)  requires  commanders  to  report  and  track  activities  that  do  not  count  for  high-deployment per diem, but still keep members away from their homes for 24 hours or more (e.g., individual  training,  hospitalization,  confinement,  etc.).    The  primary  means  to  track  high PERSTEMPO  events  is  through  accurate  and  timely  strength  accounting  duty  status  reporting.  Attachment  3  provides  a  list  of  strength  accounting  duty  status  codes  or  events  that  qualify  a member  for  high-deployment  pay;  Attachment  4  provides  a  list  of  non-pay  events  that  do  not qualify  a  member  for  high-deployment  pay.    Event  tracking  began  on  1  October  2000.    Note:  Effective  8  October  2001,  the  Deputy  Secretary  Defense  suspended  the  accumulation  of deployment  days  for  the  purpose  of  determining  eligibility  for  high  deployment  per  diem  until further notice. 4.3.  Non-Contingency strength accounting duty status procedures: 4.3.1.  Strength accounting duty status conditions are reported when an individual is or will be  projected  to  be  in  a  strength  accounting  duty  status  other  than  PFD  for  more  than  24 hours.  Most TDY strength accounting duty status conditions are updated prior to the event via  MilPDS.    Contingency  TDYs  (strength  accounting  duty  status  Codes  20  or  21)  are updated by the MPS Installation Personnel Readiness (IPR) only. 4.3.2.  Members  will  out-process  through  their  unit  SADSP  manager  the  duty  day  prior  to departure  for  their  temporary  duty  (TDY)  location.    An  AF  IMT  4334,  Individual  TDY Processing Checklist (Attachment 10) will be initiated for the member; this will not apply to the member processing through the IPR.  The top portion of AF IMT 4334 will be kept in a suspense file until the member returns and completes in-processing procedures.  The bottom portion of the form will be given to the member as a hand receipt for processing through the unit and it is recommended to keep with their orders.  The duty day after the member returns to  home  station  from  the  TDY  location,  the  member  must  in-process  though  their  unit  to complete previously initiated AF IMT 4334.  Please see attachment 11 and attachment 12 as examples of AF IMT 4334 and proper instructions on how to complete the IMT. 4.3.3.  Sick  in  Quarters,  strength  accounting  duty  status  Code  08,  will  be  used  when  a member  has  been  placed  in  quarters  by  the  Medical  Treatment  Facility  (MTF).    If  the expiration date is unknown, use the best estimate based on the facts available.  When future AFI36-2134  4 AUGUST 2014   25  hospitalization or sick in quarters information is known, project the strength accounting duty status by using future dates.  REMINDER:  The MTF updates strength accounting duty status Code 13, for members assigned to the hospital in patient status. 4.4.  After-the-Fact strength accounting duty status updates. 4.4.1.  TDY  history  data  is  extremely  important  to  the  member  and  to  the  Air  Force  for tracking  PERSTEMPO;  it’s  also  used  to  determine  entitlements  for  high-deployment  pay.  TDY  history  and  the  data  used  to  measure  PERSTEMPO  are  derived  from  strength accounting duty status.  If, for some reason, a TDY strength accounting duty status was not updated  via  strength  accounting  duty  status  reporting  and  the  member  has  subsequently returned  from  TDY,  the  data  in  his/her  TDY  history  record  must  still  be  updated.    For contingency TDY history updates, one of the following source documents must accompany a completed  travel  voucher  to  verify  the  validity  of  the  deployment  and  a  deployment  in support of a named operation: 4.4.1.1.  Certified CED order 4.4.1.2.  Certified  non-CED  order  (i.e.,  Defense  Travel  System  (DTS)  travel  order,  DD Form 1610, NATO Travel Order) 4.4.1.3.  Approved decoration 4.4.1.4.  Performance report 4.4.1.5.  Finalized letter of evaluation 4.4.1.6.  Unit  commander/deployed  commander  (squadron  level  or  higher)  letter providing  justification.   NOTE:    All  source  documents  must  identify  the  individual  and state  the  named  operation  supported  for  the  duration  of  the  TDY.    Source  documents must  also  include  the  total  inclusive  period  for  the  supported  deployment,  i.e.,  TDY departure date from home station, TDY arrival date in theater AOR, TDY departure date from the final deployed location, and TDY return date to home station.  EXAMPLE:  “In support  of  Operation  ENDURING/IRAQI  FREEDOM.”    After-the-fact  TDY  History inquiries  and  requests  should  be  coordinated  through  the  member’s  MPS  first.    For requests not meeting the above criteria, the IPR obtains approval from the Force Support Squadron  (FSS)  Operations  Officer  (FSS/OPSO)  to  update  the  TDY  History.    The FSS/OPSO  has  approval  authority;  however,  AFPC/DPA  or  ARPC/DPA  (for  ARC)  are the final disapproval authority. 4.5.  Personnel  Tempo  (PERSTEMPO)  and  Tempo  Management  Tracking  System (TMTS): 4.5.1.  TMTS was developed to track all Air Force PERSTEMPO events.  It is a total force web-based  application  that  displays  all  events  reported  through  strength  accounting  duty status  updates  and  travel  vouchers  sent  by  finance  offices.    This  tracking  system  has  the capability  to  pinpoint  individuals  who  accumulate  high-deployment  management/pay thresholds.  TMTS also allows MPSs and units to add, update, and delete events that were or weren’t  captured  by  a  strength  accounting  duty  status  update.    Strength  accounting  duty status  updates  are  imperative  to  the  success  of  tracking  events  through  TMTS  and  key  to helping  commanders  comply  with  Burdensome  Tempo  management  policies.    Without  the initial  update  from  the  personnel  community,  commanders  at  all  levels  have  no  way  to   26  AFI36-2134  4 AUGUST 2014 monitor  the  availability  of  their  personnel.    In  addition,  without  these  updates,  TMTS becomes  an  historical  database  instead  of  a  real-time  monitoring  tool.    TMTS  displays  all TDY  related  events  to  include  contingency  deployment  TDYs,  (strength  accounting  duty status Codes 20 and 21); only non-contingency deployment TDYs can be updated, corrected, or deleted by using TMTS.  Contingency deployment TDYs can only be updated by FSS/IPR personnel  through  DCAPES  and  MilPDS.    Every  person  of  every  component  of  the  USAF can  view  their  own  TDY  history  in  TMTS  by  visiting  the  AFPC  secure  web-site  at https://w20.afpc.randolph.af.mil/AFPCSecureNet20/PKI/MainMenu1.aspx 4.5.2.  Special TMTS access can be granted to commanders, strength accounting duty status managers, MAJCOMs, etc., on a case-by-case basis by e-mailing the AFPC/DPWORS inbox at  afpc.perstempo@randolph.af.mil.    Special  access  is  usually  reserved  for  personnel, whose  duties  include  verifying,  tracking,  updating,  correcting,  and  deleting  TDY  events  in TMTS  that  don’t  have  access  to  MilPDS.    Three  different  types  of  special  access  are available.    They  are:    Unit  level  access  (View  and  Update)  capability;  MPS  level  access (View  and  Update)  capability;  and  Command  level  access  (View/Inquiry  Only)  capability.  When  submitting  requests  for  special  access  users  must  supply  their:    full  name,  SSAN, access  level  required,  unit(s)  PASCODE(s)  required  or  MPS/MAJCOM  ID,  and  a  brief explanation/justification of duties required for TMTS access support. 4.6.  Leave in Conjuction with Another Strength Accounting Duty Status: 4.6.1.  Leave  in  Conjunction  with  a  Routine  TDY.    Adjust  the  start  date  and/or  number  of days if a member was projected for a TDY of which the leave will be taken outside the local area at the beginning or end of the TDY.  If leave is to be taken within the local area, follow procedures outlined in AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program. 4.6.2.  Leave  in  Conjunction  with  a  Contingency  TDY.    IPR  will  follow  appropriate combatant  commander  guidance  for  processing  leave  in  conjunction  with  a  contingency TDY.    If  leave  will  be  taken  within  the  local  area  prior  to  deployment,  follow  procedures outlined  in  AFI  36-3003,  Military  Leave  Program.    If  leave  is  taken  within  the  local  area upon completion of the deployment, follow procedures outlined by individual MAJCOMs in Post Deployment Stand-down Policy. 4.6.3.  Consecutive Overseas Tour (COT) and In-Place COT (IPCOT) leave.  Personnel who do not use COT leave during their permanent change of station must use this leave within 1 year.    A  DD  Form  1610,  Administrative  Order,  is  used  to  facilitate  this  process.    Unlike ordinary  leave,  when  an  AF  Form  988  is  processed  by  the  local  financial  service  office (FSO),  COT  leave  is  not  processed  by  the  local  FSO  until  after  the  leave  has  been  taken.  This  creates  a  situation  where  the  member  is  in  strength  accounting  duty  status  Code  00, PFD,  when  they  are,  in  fact,  on  leave.    Commanders’  support  staffs  will  update  strength accounting duty status Code 14, Not PFD -Other, on personnel taking COT/IPCOT leave not in  conjunction  with  their PCS move.  Upon return from  COT/IPCOT leave and subsequent filing of the travel voucher, the member’s leave will be charged. 4.6.4.  Convalescent  Leave.    Authorized  personnel  going  on  convalescent  leave  for prescribed  recuperation  are  not  in  a  chargeable  leave  status.    When  an  AF  Form  988  is accomplished, units will update the member’s strength accounting duty status Code to 14. AFI36-2134  4 AUGUST 2014   27  4.6.5.  Emergency Leave from Overseas.  Use AF Form 972, Request and Authorization for Emergency  Leave  Travel,  IAW  AFI  36-3003,  and  DFAS  DEM  7073-2,  Unit  Leave Procedures, Chapter 7, for members authorized funded emergency travel.  Emergency leave is  travel-generated  leave  processed  after  the  fact  on  an  AF  Form  985,  Report  of  Travel Time/Leave,  and  accomplished  by  the  local  FSO  travel  section.    In  addition,  units  or  MPS will  update  strength  accounting  duty  status  Code  14  in  these  instances  to  maintain accountability. 4.6.6.  Not PFD at  Home Station  (strength  accounting duty status  Code 14).  For personnel attending  professional  military  education  (PME),  performing  resource  augmentation (READY)  or  correctional  custody  duty,  on  a  contingency  pass  (days  off  as  a  result  of  a deployment),  or  another  event  which  makes  a  person  not  PFD  within  their  assigned  unit  at their home station, update strength accounting duty status Code 14.  Strength accounting duty status  Code  14  does  not  impact  the  TDY  history  or  accumulator  files  and  is  not  counted towards high-deployment pay.  NOTE:  Strength accounting duty status Code 14 should only be  updated  as  a  current  change  in  the  person’s  strength  accounting  duty  status  and  not projected.  If strength accounting duty status Code 14 is projected, it will not consummate on the effective date.   28  AFI36-2134  4 AUGUST 2014 Chapter 5 DUTY STATUS EFFECTIVENESS REPORT (DSERT)  5.1.  Purpose.  The  DSERT  was  created  as  a  report  card  for  wing  commanders  to  show  the effectiveness  of  their  individual  TDY  SADSP,  derived  from  information  contained  within  the TDY  Assignments  area,  TDY  History  File.    The  DSERT  file  serves  as  a  tool  to  assist commanders  in  assessing  the  effectiveness  of  their  TDY  strength  accounting  duty  status reporting procedures. 5.2.  Background.  The  DSERT  file  provides  overall  MAJCOM  and  wing  (MPS  ID) commander’s statistics on how well strength  accounting duty status  changes are being reported for  their  organizations.    The  report  will  show  the  total  number  of  records  in  the  TDY Assignments area, TDY History application in MilPDS for the reporting period, total number of records  received  via  a  strength  accounting  duty  status  update  and  a  strength  accounting  duty status percentage. 5.3.  Production  and  Distribution.  The  DSERT  is  produced  on  a  monthly  basis  from DISCOVERER  by  the  base-level  Personnel  Systems  Manager  (PSM)  and  forwarded  to  unit commanders and unit strength accounting duty status managers.  Information used to create the DSERT is broken down into a detailed report containing name, individual unit percentages and TDY Types by unit.  This will be sent to the MPS flight chief who is required to break out and distribute this information to appropriate units. 5.3.1.  Data  Capture.    The  TDY  Assignments,  TDY  History  File  receives  its  information from DFAS interface as a result of a completed travel voucher or a strength accounting duty status  projection/update  through  MilPDS.    The  DSERT  is  based  on  the  assumption  people will file a travel voucher at the completion of their TDY.  With this assumption, statistics are developed to indicate the effectiveness of TDY strength accounting duty status reporting. 5.3.2.  Statistics.  Statistical analysis is possible because we receive records in TDY History via  our  DFAS  interface,  thus  providing  a  baseline  to  determine  if  corresponding  strength accounting  duty  status  updates  were  made.    Statistics  are  developed  based  on  the  total number of TDY records compared to those records that do not contain a strength accounting duty status update.  DANIEL R.

Contingency— Joint Pub 1-02, DOD Dictionary of Military Terms, defines a contingency as an emergency  involving  military  forces  caused  by  natural  disasters,  terrorists,  subversives,  or required military operations.  This includes any duty in a declared war, hostile fire or imminent danger zone, a peacekeeping or humanitarian operation, or rotational TDY operations. Exercise— A military maneuver or simulated wartime operation involving planning, preparation and  execution;  it  is  accomplished  for  the  purpose  of  training  and  evaluation.    It  maybe  a multinational,  Joint,  Other  Government  Agencies  (OGA)  support,  or  a  single-Service  exercise; depending on participating organizations. Deployment—  For  personnel  accountability  and individual  deployment  credit  any contingency/deployment  TDY  away  from  the  home  station  that  fills  a  validated  combatant, component  commander  or  supported  major  command  (MAJCOM)  requirement  for  forces  in support of a named operation or exercise. AFI 36-2134, Attachment 2, lists strength accounting duty  status  Code  20  as  a  “TDY  Contingency,  Rotational,  Exercise,”  and  is  used  to  show  the deployment  of  an  individual  in  support  of  a  Plan  Identification  (PID)  named  operation.    This strength  accounting  duty  status  is  updated  by  a  daily  system  interface  between  DCAPES  and MilPDS. Strength Accounting  Duty Status— Term used to replace duty status as it applies to when an individual is projected to be or is in a strength accounting duty status condition other than PFD, as well as when he/she is subsequently returned to PFD.

Home Station Training/Local Area Training is training performed which prevents the member from returning to their permanent residence or lodging location for more than 24 hours, other than performance of their normal day-to-day duties. For example, all or part of a unit is sent to the field to pitch tents and live in the woods for 3 days in preparation for an upcoming ORI or deployment. This is usually training in the field and can be accomplished on the member’s permanent training site or at a designated satellite training facility or base. For Air Reserve Component members: Home station/local area training will count as a deployment event if accomplishing Annual Training, Active Duty Training, or Active Duty Special Work and member cannot return to normal lodging. Normal lodging is defined as the member’s permanent residence, or if the permanent training site is outside the member’s commuting distance, normal lodging is defined as the member’s normal on-base/off-base billeting facilities.   Unit commanders may only keep unsatisfactory participants if the manning policy permits. Commanders provide the MPS with a written statement that the member is needed to achieve the unit’s mobilization mission.

Preparation of AF IMT 2098, Duty Status Change. Rule If preparing Then 1   2   3                 Address Element   “TO” The servicing MPS. “FROM” The organization reporting the strength accounting duty status change   Section I   Section II   Enter member’s last name, first name, middle initial, Sr., etc., grade, SSN   Enter the member’s strength accounting duty status change code (see Attachment 2) “From” & “To”.                  Enter the “Effective date” and “Hour” of when the event took place.    For example: (Date) 13 Feb 2003, (Hour) 13:59.    NOTE:  The day a member enters into a unfavorable strength accounting duty status is considered a bad day and is the first day of chargeable lost time. The day a member is released or returns from a unfavorable strength accounting duty status regardless of the time is considered a good day and is not counted as lost time (note 1).  The “Location” block will reflect the location of the member when the member is entered into the new strength accounting duty status code. For example: A member goes from PFD to AWOL while they are assigned to Randolph AFB TX, the location of the AWOL would reflect Randolph AFB TX. If the member goes from AWOL to civil confinement in the Bexar County Jail, San Antonio TX, the location would reflect Bexar County Jail, San Antonio TX. Once the member is released from civil confinement and returned to PFD, the location block would reflect Randolph AFB TX.   AUTHORITY BLOCK: AFI 36-2134    Indicate the “Method of Return to Military Control” when a member returns from a unfavorable strength accounting duty status – Whether it was voluntary or involuntary.   “Determination of Lost Time by Unit Commander” – When a member returns from an unauthorized absence (i.e., AWOL, Deserter, Confinement), you will need to annotate their “Period of Absence.” All periods of confinement are considered lost time by US Code, Title 10, Section 972.    1. Enter the date (DD/MMM/YYYY) of when the unfavorable strength accounting duty status started and the last day of lost time charged. For example, Amn Jones was placed into confinement on 13 Mar 02 and was released on 25 Mar 02. His period of absence would be 13 Mar 02 thru 24 Mar 02, his effective date for PFD would be 25 Mar 02.    NOTE: The day a member enters into a unfavorable strength accounting duty status is considered a bad day and is the first day of chargeable lost time. The day a member is released or returns from a unfavorable strength accounting duty status is considered a good day and is not counted as lost time. Once you enter the period of absence you will need to mark whether the period of absence “Is” or “Is Not” determined as lost time, per AFI 36-2134.    2. If a “Determination of Absence” cannot be made, annotate the dates of the period of absence and state a brief reason why the determination could not be made.    3A. If the period of absence was determined as lost time, enter the consecutive amount of days in “Total Lost Days This Enlistment”.    NOTE: This will not always be the same as the total lost days to this incident. If the member had another lost time incident while in his current enlistment you will need to add the amount of days to this incident and then annotate the total in this block. “Remarks”- Enter a statement relating to the circumstances reflected on the AF IMT 2098 (e.g., for a member going into military confinement, state the member was court-martialed and sentenced to 8 months of military confinement with a bad conduct discharge).    4   Section III   The unit commander, squadron section commander, or authorized representative, as designated in writing, will sign the “Squadron Commander or Designated Representative” block.

They will annotate the date, name, grade, title and signature.    NOTE: They will also annotate the “System Update Completed On” block if the unit was not able to make the update. ASSIGNMENTS: The assignments manager will coordinate in this block ensuring all assignment actions have been completed regarding this strength accounting duty status change. The coordinator will annotate the date, name, grade, title and signature.    PROMOTIONS: The promotions manager will coordinate in this block ensuring all promotion actions have been completed regarding this strength accounting duty status change. The coordinator will annotate the date, name, grade, title and signature.
