(HAF/A3)  Paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2, Battlefield Airmen Core Activities and specialized capabilities, updated to comply with joint terminology. 2 AFPD10-35  5 JUNE 2017 independent  of  an  established  airbase  or 1.  BA  directly  lead,  control,  and/or  execute  operational  air  and  space  power  functions  in the  forward  battlespace its  perimeter defenses.  Comprising  several  Air  Force  Specialties,  BA  primarily  operate  in  the  land  domain removed  from  traditional  airbase  support,  logistics,  and  sortie  generation  efforts.    BA  may  be employed  unilaterally  or  as  part  of  an  AF,  joint,  interagency  or  multinational  force,  to  support Combatant Commander (CCDR) objectives and may operate under the most austere conditions for extended periods. 2.  The  BA  initiative  encompasses  the  following  specific  Air  Force  Specialty  Codes (AFSC):  Combat Rescue Officers (CRO, 13DXA), Special Tactics Officers (STO, 13CXB), Air Liaison  Officers  (ALO,  13LX),  Pararescue  (PJ,  1T2XX),  Combat  Control  (CCT,  1C2XX), Tactical  Air  Control  Party  (TACP,  1C4XX)  and  Special  Operations  Weather  Team  (SOWT, 1W0X2).  Collectively, BA lead and execute the following core activities in support of Air Force Core Functions: 2.1.  Battlefield Airmen Core Activities: 2.1.1.  Direct Action 2.1.2.  Special Reconnaissance 2.1.3.  Weather Planning and Operations 2.1.4.  Personnel Recovery/Material Recovery Operations 2.1.5.  Hostage Rescue and Personnel/Material Recovery 2.1.6.

Joint Fires and Effects Integration 2.1.12.  Security Force Assistance 2.2.  More specifically, BA provide or enable the following specialized capabilities: 2.2.1.  Reconnaissance and Surveillance 2.2.2.  Environmental and Atmospheric Weather Operations 2.2.3.  Terminal Attack Control 2.2.4.  Preparation of the Environment 2.2.5.  Command and Control 2.2.6.  Specialized Air Mobility 2.2.7.  Strike, Post Strike Reconnaissance, and Battle Damage Assessment 2.2.8.  Sensitive Material Recovery and Destruction 2.2.9.  Technical Rescue and Recovery Operations AFPD10-35  5 JUNE 2017 3 3.  Policy.  The Air Force will continue to organize, train, and equip BA to conduct operations in contested,  denied,  operational  limited,  and  permissive  environments  under  any  environmental conditions.  Given the dynamic nature of special operations, BA who conduct special operations will be specifically trained and equipped to do so. 3.1.  Organize:  BA are organized and employed in force packages tailored to their individual mission area doctrine, operational nature, operating environment, and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP). 3.2.  Train:  Training of BA is accomplished via individual AFSC curriculums tailored to the specialized missions of each functional area.  Commonalities in individual BA training will be  identified  for  inclusion  in  a  shared  training  program  designed  to  efficiently  provide specialized  instruction  and  prepare  BA  candidates  for  follow-on  training  and  the  rigorous nature of BA surface operations.  BA training will prepare BA to perform the missions they are required to conduct  IAW the National Military Strategy, the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan, applicable Operational Plans, and Designed Operational Capability statements. 3.3.  Equip:    BA  require  a  broad  spectrum  of  specialized  equipment  items:    individual equipment  (clothing  and  protective  gear),  common  equipment  (i.e.,  weapons,  airborne, amphibious, SCUBA, communications, and vehicles) and mission equipment (i.e., targeting, reconnaissance,  meteorological,  explosives,  medical,  and  rescue).    BA  equipment  must  be lightweight, ruggedized, interoperable and functional in all environmental conditions. 4.  Roles and Responsibilities.  The following responsibilities and authorities are established: 4.1.  HQ USAF/A3 will: 4.1.1.  Develop  and  publish  BA  policy  in  coordination  with  lead  Major  Commands (MAJCOMs). 4.1.2.  Provide capabilities-based reviews of MAJCOM requirements and coordinate with AFMC and lead MAJCOMs to align developmental and programming initiatives within the Program Objective Memorandum (POM). 4.1.3.  Provide  Air  Force  Corporate  oversight  of  organization,  equipping,  training  and utilization of BA. 4.2.  Lead  MAJCOMs  for  respective  BA  capabilities  will  lead  the  development  and publishing of TTPs.  Lead MAJCOMs for TTPs are delineated as follows: 4.2.1.  Air  Combat  Command  is  lead  MAJCOM  for  Joint  Fires  Integration,  Close  Air Support,  Terminal  Attack  Control,  Personnel  Recovery,  and  TACP  integration  with conventional US and Multinational ground forces. 4.2.2.  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Command  is  lead  MAJCOM  for  Small  Unmanned Aerial  Systems,  Sensitive  Material  Recovery  and  Destruction,  Explosive  Breaching, Preparation of the Environment, and Reconnaissance and Surveillance. 4.2.3.  Air Force Materiel  Command is the lead MAJCOM for capabilities development and full life-cycle acquisition management of equipment items to ensure interoperability of  common  use  BA  equipment  and  capitalization  on  opportunities  for  synergies  across BA mission areas. AFPD10-35  5 JUNE 2017 4.3.  MAJCOMs  with  assigned  BA  forces  will  organize,  train,  and  equip  sufficient  BA  to meet Unit Type Code requirements to accomplish missions in support of CCDR objectives. 4.4.  Air  Education  &  Training  Command  will  optimize  BA  institutional  training  to  meet validated  service  requirements  in  compliance  with  AFSC-specific  CFETPs.    Emphasis  will be  on  developing  courses  that  leverage  commonalities  of  training  across  the  BA  mission areas. 4  LISA S.
