Individuals serving  in  an  overseas  area  interested  in  applying  for  an  Air  Force  commissioning  program requiring a Date Eligible for Return from Overseas (DEROS) curtailment must comply with all provisions listed in AFI 36-2110.  These procedures provide applicants a window of opportunity to  serve  as  much  of  their  tour  length  as  possible.    Monitoring  of  this  window  is  critical  to  the success  of  the  applicants  submitting  their  commissioning  application.    AFRS  will  initiate DEROS curtailment requests for BOT selectees as required. 1.12.  Air  Force  Specialty  Code  (AFSC)  Classification/Reclassification.  Once  an  individual has been selected as a candidate for a commissioning program and classified into an AFSC, the classification remains firm.  The only considerations for a change in classification will be to meet the  needs  of  the  Air  Force,  to  rectify  an  administrative  error,  to  address  a  specific  individual hardship,  or  if  the  individual  fails  to  meet  or  becomes  disqualified  from  meeting  a  physical standard  or  security  requirement.    Submit  request  through  HQ  AFRS/RSOCL  (BOT  OTs)  and HQ AFROTC/RRUE (AFROTC cadets), who will in turn forward it to AFPC/DPSIP for action.   16   AFI36-2013  23 OCTOBER 2008 Table 1.1.

The official letter must also state exact degree to be awarded. 3.4.4.5.  For those with prior or current military service:   62  AFI36-2013  23 OCTOBER 2008 3.4.4.5.1.  Enlisted.  Not currently be on active duty.  Applicant may not have served on  active  duty  or  in  any  component,  in  any  service,  as  an  enlisted  member  in  any grade above E-3. 3.4.4.5.2.  Officer.    Not  be  a  commissioned  officer  on  active  duty.      Applicant  may not  have  served  on  active  duty  as  a  commissioned  officer  of  any  service  or component for any length of time. 3.4.5.  Phases of the Program.  The TDSP is conducted in four phases: 3.4.5.1.  Phase I -- Selection/Classification Phase.  The TDSP applicant is first recruited from  an  appropriately  accredited  school.    After  basic  eligibility  is  determined,  the application package is  submitted to  HQ AFRS for review and initiation of the selection process.    Refer  to  Table  3.1,  BOT  and  TDSP  Application  Documents,  for  application requirements.  HQ  AFRS  notifies  applicants  of  selection  board  results.    AFPC  classifies selectees based on academic background and AF needs. 3.4.5.2.  Phase II -- Enlistment Phase.  Once individuals are notified and accept, they are enlisted  according  to  AFRSI  36-2001,  Regular  Air  Force  and  Special  Category Accessions,  at  the  nearest  MEPS.    During  enlistment  processing,  the  MEPS  Liaison Noncommissioned Officer (LNCO) again briefs the applicant on all details of TDSP and has the applicant execute the TDSP contract agreement (Attachments 3, 4, and 5), which becomes an annex to the DD Form 4, Enlistment/Reenlistment Document.  Enlistees are placed on active duty as OTs with a special duty identifier of 9T100, Officer Trainee, and assigned to HQ AFRS, with permanent duty location at the enlistee’s school. 3.4.5.3.  Phase III -- Academic Phase.  During this phase, the TDSP participant is under the  administrative  control  of  HQ  AFRS.    Degree  requirements  must  be  met  within  a specific time period.  Students failing to complete their approved degree programs within the  period  of  time  prescribed  by  the  TDSP  contract  may  receive  one  academic  term extension.    The  extended  academic  term  is  limited  to  the  next  scheduled  term  after  the last  contract  month  of  the  program.    HQ  AFRS  is  the  extension  approval  authority  for students  who  fail  to  graduate  on  time.    Evaluations  are  on  a  case-by-case  basis  and  are approved only in instances where circumstances clearly indicate the best interests of the Air Force will be served.  An extension will not be granted where student neglect is the cause.    Extensions  are  not  routine  and  usually  are  approved  only  when  a  student  can make  up  the  course  in  a  summer  session.    Students  who  fail  a  core  course,  sequential course,  or  courses  offered  once  a  year,  or  where  summer  sessions  are  not  available, usually  will  not  receive  a  waiver.    They  will  be  called  to  extended  active  duty  in  their enlisted  grade.    The  TDSP  enlistee  must  ensure  a  current  official  transcript  will  be provided to HQ AFRS/RSO at the end of each academic term. 3.4.5.4.  Phase IV -- Military Phase.  During this phase, individuals who have completed the academic phase and received their degree are assigned to OTS for pre-commissioning training.  HQ AFRS is responsible for processing individuals into OTS. 3.4.5.4.1.  TDSP  participants  completing  degree  requirements  are  assigned  PCS  to their new duty station with TDY en route as OTs at  OTS.  Selectees will be sent  to the first available OTS class after graduation.  Selectees’ records and orders should be sent to arrive at Maxwell AFB AL, NLT 10 calendar days before class reporting date. AFI36-2013  23 OCTOBER 2008   63  3.4.5.4.2.  AFPC and the local MPE are responsible for publishing orders for Airmen completing  degree  requirements  and  reassigning  the  Airmen  PCS  to  their  new  duty station with TDY en route as OTs at OTS. 3.4.6.  Failure to Complete the Program. 3.4.6.1.  Academic Phase Eliminees.  (See Attachment 6, Instructions for Disposition of Eliminees.) 3.4.6.2.  HQ  AFRS  is  delegated  the  responsibility  and  authority  to  promptly  dismiss Airmen  who  fail  to  maintain  acceptable  retention  standards,  including  satisfactory academic progress and commission potential. 3.4.6.3.  Failure  to  complete  the  academic  phase  within  the  specified  period  of  time  for which selected is justification for removal from school on a case-by-case basis. 3.4.6.4.  HQ  AFRS  is  responsible  for  immediate  notification  to  AFPC/DPSOA  when  a TDSP student is disenrolled from the academic phase. 3.4.6.5.  HQ  AFRS  is  responsible  for  processing  eliminees  to  their  next  assignment  as expeditiously as possible. 3.4.6.6.  Baccalaureate  Degree-Seeking  Eliminees.    If  the  TDSP  applicant  fails  to complete the program  in  either the academic or  military phase, he/she must  continue to serve 2 years on active duty in an enlisted status that commences with their reporting date to basic military training (BMT). 3.4.6.6.1.  For prior service individuals who will not require BMT attendance, 2 years commences with  their date arrived station (DAS) at  their first  duty assignment after TDSP disenrollment.  Individual assignment desires will be considered, however, Air Force  requirements  will  take  precedence.    AFPC  Classifications  will  ensure participant is properly classified during BMT. 3.4.6.6.2.  HQ AFRS/RSO and AFPC will ensure participants are properly classified to fill Air Force needs. 3.4.6.6.3.  HQ  AFRS,  in  conjunction  with  AFPC/DPSOA,  is  responsible  for processing  academic  eliminees  per  paragraph  3.4.6.6  as  expeditiously  as  possible.  AFPC and OTS are responsible for processing OTS eliminees per paragraph 3.4.6.6 as expeditiously as possible. 3.4.6.7.  Military  Phase.    TDSP  participants  are  attached  to  OTS  for  administration  of UCMJ actions while in the military phase. 3.4.6.8.  Refer to Table 3.1 for TDSP application requirements. 3.5.  OTS Application Process. 3.5.1.  HQ AFRS is responsible for processing applications for individuals applying for BOT. Civilian applicants may refer to AFRSI 36-2001 for application and eligibility requirements.  See  Tables  2.4  through  2.7  for  Organizational  Program  Manager  Responsibilities  for  all commissioning programs. 3.5.2.

Guidance  regarding  clothing  allowances  for  Reservists  can  be  found  in  the  DoD Financial Management Regulation (FMR), Volume 7A, Chapter 29. 3.6.3.1.  AFRC units conduct clothing inspections for their members selected for OTS. AFI36-2013  23 OCTOBER 2008   67  3.6.3.2.  The host or base equipment management office replaces uniform items meeting the  criteria  in  AFMAN  67-1,  Basic  Air  Force  Supply  Procedures,  Volume  1,  Part  1, Chapter 17. 3.7.  Granting Leave to Officer Trainees (OTs).  OTs may go on leave in accordance with AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program.  The 22 TRSS/MSPC serves as the leave processing activity for OTs. 3.8.  Administration of OT Personnel Actions. 3.8.1.  The  22  TRSS/MSPC  serves  as  the  MPE  for  all  OTs.    It  uses  a  modified  MilPDS  to access  and  process  data,  classify  and  assign  OTs,  and  perform  other  actions  necessary  to maintain their military personnel files. 3.8.2.  The  24  TRS/CC  manages  and  controls  all  BOT  functions  including  administrative procedures  for  the  elimination  and  recycling  of  students.    The  23  TRS/CC  manages  and controls  all  COT  functions  including  administrative  procedures  for  the  elimination  and recycling of students. 3.9.  Elimination of OTs. 3.9.1.  The OTS/CC is the disenrollment decision authority for all trainees.  The 24 TRS/CC is  the  recycle  decision  authority.    The  OTS/CC  may  delegate  disenrollment  authority  for administrative  disenrollments  only  (self-initiated  elimination,  medical,  extended  absence, initial eligibility) to the 24 TRS/CC. 3.9.2.  Consider eliminating an OT from training for any of the following reasons: 3.9.2.1.  Military  Training  Deficiency  (MTD).  OT  fails  to  achieve  passing  scores  on written  and  performance  measurements.  Three  failures  usually  signal  a  MTD,  but  any number  of  failures  may  form  a  basis  for  elimination,  depending  on  the  severity  of  the deficiencies and on surrounding circumstances. 3.9.2.2.  Lack  of  Adaptability.  OT  demonstrates  inability  to  adapt  to  or  display  the necessary physical, psychological, or personality traits of an Air Force officer, or an OT lacks  the  personal  capacity  and  inclination,  whether  natural  or  acquired,  to  adapt  to military  relationships,  customs,  and  responsibilities  that  have  become  traditional  and necessary in military service.  Also includes, but is not limited to, any misconduct which would  constitute  a  basis  for  discharge  under  AFI  36-3206,  Administrative  Discharge Procedures  for  Commissioned  Officers,  or  AFI  36-3208,  Administrative  Separation  of Airmen. 3.9.2.3.  Self-Initiated  Elimination  (SIE).  Withdrawal  from  the  course  results  from  a student's written request for elimination. 3.9.2.4.  Medical  Disqualification.    Results  from  a  medical  defect  or  condition  that renders the student incapable of maintaining the physical standards required to complete the program.  The 24 TRS/CC initiates elimination due to medical disqualification after proper medical authority certifies the OT as “disqualified.”  The 24 TRS/CC ensures the medical disqualification information is noted in the remarks section of the DD Form 785 Record of Disenrollment from Officer Candidate-Type Training.  The DD Form 785 will indicate whether an OT is permanently or temporarily medically disqualified.   68  AFI36-2013  23 OCTOBER 2008 3.9.2.4.1.  OTs  who  are  deemed  permanently  medically  disqualified  (per  conditions listed in AFI 48-123) will have their records reviewed by HQ AETC/SGPS who will confirm  the  disqualifying  factor.    The  review  date  will  be  annotated  in  the  remarks section of the DD Form 785. 3.9.2.4.2.  OTs  who  qualified  medical  personnel  believe  can  recover  from  their medical condition within 180 days and complete the physical training requirements of OTS  will  be  given  a  180-day  reinstatement  option  which  will  be  outlined  in  the remarks section of the DD Form 785. 3.9.2.4.2.1.  In  the  case  of  pregnancy,  formerly  pregnant  OTs  may  be  given  a reinstatement  option  to  return  to  training  6  months  after  the  completion  of pregnancy.  An OT is expected to return to training immediately after the 6-month timeframe as long as the OT meets accession and medical standards. 3.9.2.5.  Extended absence from training for personal reasons (usually more than 3 days) for any reason. 3.9.2.6.  A determination that the OT was initially ineligible for OTS to include OTs who do not meet initial Body Mass Index or Body Fat requirements. 3.9.2.7.  Prejudicial  Conduct,  any  conduct  inconsistent  with  the  OTS  honor  code,  or demonstration  of  undesirable  character  traits.  OTS  will  give  strong  consideration  to initiating  administrative  discharge  action  under  AFI  36-3208  for  any  OT  eliminated under this paragraph. 3.9.3.  OTS  processes  OT  elimination  in  accordance  with  internal  procedures  and  AETC, Holm Center, and OTS instructions.  OTS is responsible for completing a DD Form 785 to document each elimination from training case. 3.9.4.  22 TRSS/MSPC will notify AFPC/DPSIP immediately of any active duty quota OTs actually removed from training who are within 5 days of graduating. 3.10.  Disposition of Disenrolled OTs. 3.10.1.  22 TRSS/MSPC processes disenrolled OTs in  accordance with  the guidelines listed in Table 3.4. AFI36-2013  23 OCTOBER 2008   69  Table 3.4.  Disposition of Disenrolled Officer Trainees. R U L E 1   2 3 4 5 6 7 8     9         Disenrolled Officer Trainee Procedures If the OT being eliminated entered OTS as a nonprior or prior service applicant and specifically enlisted to attend OTS, OTS will process a discharge under AFI 36-3208, paragraph 5.22. (entry level performance or conduct), paragraph 3.10. (voluntary discharge after elimination from OTS), or another appropriate paragraph.  If the OT being eliminated entered OTS as an active duty applicant (including those who entered through AECP) and is being eliminated for failure to meet military retention standards, consider processing the OT for discharge under AFI 36-3208.  If discharge is not warranted by the circumstances, OTS processes the OT for reassignment.  If the OT being eliminated entered as an active duty applicant (including those who entered through AECP), and is not being eliminated for failure to meet military retention standards, OTS processes the OT for reassignment.    If the OT being eliminated is a non-prior service applicant, OTS will demote the applicant to A1C (see AFI 36-2002 and AFI 36-2503). If the OT being eliminated is an AFRC applicant, HQ AFRC/A1BB instructs  22 TRSS/MSPC whether to process a discharge or a reassignment. If the OT being eliminated is a prior service applicant, OTS will demote the applicant to the rank held immediately before entering OTS (if below SSgt). OTS files the DD Form 785 in the UPRG or ARMS for all OTS elimination cases.   If the OT is a non-prior or prior service applicant (i.e. not AD USAF applicant) and elects, in writing, to enlist in the Regular Air Force, 24 TRS/CCA transfers the student to the 22 TRSS/MSPC. -  22 TRSS/MSPC sends the request to AFPC/DPSOA, 550 C Street West, Suite 10, - Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4712 for approval or disapproval. If AFPC/DPSOA approves enlistment, the trainee may not request separation at a later date under this AFI. When reassigning eliminated OTs, OTS: - counts the time the member spent as an OT in computing the member’s remaining service obligation. -  when required, adjusts the member’s grade to that authorized under the non-prior or prior service enlistment program (see AFI 36-2002), as applicable, at the time of his or her current enlistment.  -  demotes an individual who was an active duty Airman in accordance with AFI 36- 2503. -  promotes an Airman entitled to promotion because of previous selection (see Table 3.3) in accordance with AFI 36-2502. 10  22 TRSS/MSPC requests assignment instructions for eliminated active duty Airmen from the appropriate AFPC assignment OPR (see AFI 36-2110) and sends an information copy of the request to:  -  AFPC/DPSIP, the losing MAJCOM, and MPE. (see Attachment 8)   70  R U L E  11 12 13 AFI36-2013  23 OCTOBER 2008     Disenrolled Officer Trainee Procedures -  AFPC/DPSIP and AFROTC/RRUE if the disenrolled OT was an AECP participant. AFPC/DPSIP or the assignment OPR sends assignment instructions to the servicing MPE. The OT’s servicing MPE publishes the required assignment or separation orders and sends them to 22 TRSS/MSPC for presentation to the OT. The OT remains attached to 24 TRSS/CCA pending receipt of assignment or separation orders. 3.11.  Placing OTs on Hold. 3.11.1.  No later than 3 duty days before graduation, 22 TRSS/MSPC notifies AFPC/DPSIP of OTs whose status requires that they be held over, specifically, OTs who are: 3.11.1.1.  Awaiting medical qualification. 3.11.1.2.  Awaiting action that rendered them ineligible for graduation. 3.11.1.3.  Awaiting receipt of official transcripts. 3.11.1.4.  Awaiting  completion  of  a  NAC  (unless  the  OT  has  prior  enlisted  service without a break in service greater than 24 months). 3.11.2.  22 TRSS/MSPC may notify appropriate agencies by telephone or e-mail by close of the duty day the withholding action occurred. 3.11.3.  OTs not cleared for commissioning by their graduation date and held over to a later class may be commissioned as soon as all required actions are complete.  They need not wait until the commissioning date for the next BOT class. 3.11.4.  22  TRSS/MSPC  notifies  HQ  AFRC/A1BB  when  holding  over  OTs  who  are  filling AFRC quotas. 3.12.  Graduation and Commissioning. 3.12.1.  An  OT  who  was  a  cadet  at  any  service  academy  (including  the  Coast  Guard  and Merchant Marine academies) may not receive a commission before the commissioning date of his or her former academy classmates.  EXCEPTION:  AFPC/CC may grant a waiver. 3.12.2.  24  TRS/CC  ensures  Flight  Commanders  (Flt/CCs)  will  conduct  a  thorough  pre-commissioning review of any OT whose mental, moral, physical, and professional fitness are questionable.  Upon conclusion of the pre-commissioning review the Flt/CC will recommend appointment or other action. 3.12.3.  When  the  Flt/CC  and  the  reviewing  authorities  do  not  recommend  an  OT  for commissioning, 24 TRS/CC determines if elimination action is appropriate. 3.12.4.  When a qualified OT does not accept an appointment, 22 TRSS/MSPC: 3.12.4.1.  Processes the OT as an eliminated student. 3.12.4.2.  Terminates the appointment offer. 3.12.4.3.  Takes action to have the OT reassigned, if required. AFI36-2013  23 OCTOBER 2008   71  3.12.5.  If it is discovered that a civilian or UCMJ criminal action or investigation is pending against  an  OT,  24  TRS/CC  suspends  commissioning  actions  until  the  case  is  resolved.  EXCEPTION:    Minor  traffic  violations  do  not  require  a  commissioning  suspension.    If  24 TRS/CC  determines,  in  consultation  with  Holm  Center/JA,  that  resolution  of  the  criminal case will be delayed for an unusual length of time, OTS consults AFPC/DPSIP for guidance.  If  the  OT  is  the  subject  of  any  adverse  adjudication  while  in  OTS  (such  as  a  deferred judgment  or  pretrial  diversion),  24  TRS/CC  consults  with  Holm  Center/JA  to  consider appropriate waiver action in accordance with AFI 36-2002. 3.12.6.  When an OT who entered OTS to fill an active duty quota accepts an appointment, 22 TRSS/MSPC orders the officer to EAD for 4 years. 3.12.7.  Officers  who  later  complete  UFT  incur  additional  ADSCs  in  accordance  with  AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments. 3.12.8.  When  an  OT  who  entered  OTS  to  fill  an  AFRC  quota  accepts  an  appointment,  22 TRSS/MSPC: 3.12.8.1.  Notifies  HQ  ARPC/DPAAA  (Accessions  Branch)  to  appoint  the  OT  as  a second lieutenant in the USAFR. 3.12.8.2.  Returns the member to the unit of assignment for duty as a Reserve officer. 3.12.8.3.  Reserve officers selected for undergraduate flying training or technical training proceed under orders published by the AFRC unit. 3.12.9.  22  TRSS/MSPC  terminates  a  newly  commissioned  officer's  enlisted  status  by discharging the OT in accordance with AFI 36-3208. Upon discharge, deliver the DD Form 214 to the new OT on the discharge date. 3.12.10.  22 TRSS/MSPC initiates appropriate military record groups in accordance with AFI 36-2608,  Military  Personnel  Records  Systems,  and  updates  the  Foreign  Language  Self Assessment in MilPDS prior to class graduation. 3.12.11.  22  TRSS/MSPC  disposes  of  Regular  Air  Force  and  Air  Force  Reserve  members' records by: 3.12.11.1.  Transferring  the  member's  Field  Personnel  Record  Group  (FPRG)  in accordance with AFI 36-2608. 3.12.11.2.
