Use  it  in  conjunction  with  aircraft  flight manuals, Flight Information Publications (FLIP), and applicable USAF publications. It applies to training,  normal,  and  contingency  operations  to  reduce  the  need  for  any  procedural  changes  at the onset of contingencies. 1.1.1.  HQ  AETC/A3V  has  overall  responsibility  for  administration  of  this  instruction  and checklists.  Submit  suggested this  instruction  on  AF  Form  847, Recommendation  for  Change  of  Publication,  through  MAJCOM  channels  to  AETC/A3V according to AFI 11-215, Flight Manual Program (FMP). improvements to 1.2.  Applicability.  This  instruction  is  directive  to  all  personnel  assigned  or  attached  to  USAF TH-1H  helicopter  units.  This  instruction,  in  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives, prescribes  guidance  for  TH-1H  aircraft.  Crewmembers  must  have  a  thorough  working knowledge of all procedures applicable to their crew position and mission qualification. 1.3.  Mission.  The  primary  mission  of  the  TH-1H  unit  is  specialized  undergraduate  pilot training-helicopter (SUPT-H) at Fort Rucker, AL. 1.4.  Pilot  Responsibilities.  This  regulation,  in  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives, prescribes  guidance  for  TH-1H  aircraft  under  most  circumstances,  but  is  not  to  be  used  as  a substitute  for  sound  judgment  or  common  sense.    Operations  or  procedures  not  specifically addressed  (here  or  in  other  governing  instructions)  may  be  accomplished  if  they  enhance  safe effective mission accomplishment. 1.5.  Deviations.  Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this instruction except: 1.5.1.  For  safety,  aircraft  commanders  may  deviate  from  this  directive  as  necessary  to protect  their  crew  and  aircraft  if  they  believe  strict  compliance  would  jeopardize  safe operations. 1.5.2.  When  circumstances  require,  this  publication  provides  guidance  for  helicopter operations under most circumstances, but it does not substitute for sound judgment. If within communications  range  of  command  and  control  agencies,  deviations  due  to  unusual circumstances should be pre-coordinated. 1.6.  Waivers.  The  waiver  authority  for  this  instruction  is  tiered  as  described  below.    For MAJCOM/A3 waivers, submit requests through standardization/evaluation (Stan/Eval) channels. When an operational necessity exists and time does not allow pursuit of a waiver through normal channels, the OG/CC has one-time waiver authority to this instruction.(T-2) Report all deviations without waiver through Stan/Eval channels within 10 days of the occurrence. 1.6.1.  Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk. 1.6.1.1.  “Tier 0” (T-0):  Requirement has been determined by non-AF authority; waiver authority is non-applicable or external to AF. 1.6.1.2.  “Tier  1”  (T-1): this  requirement  puts  Airmen, commanders  or  the  USAF  strongly  at  risk  of  mission  or  program  failure,  death,  injury,   Non-compliance  with AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   9  legal  jeopardy  or  unacceptable  fraud,  waste  or  abuse.    The  waiver  authority  is  the MAJCOM/CC, delegable no lower than MAJCOM Director, with the concurrence of the AFI Certifying Official. 1.6.1.3.  “Tier 2”  (T-2):  Non-compliance with this requirement may degrade mission or program effectiveness or efficiency and has potential to create moderate risk of mission or  program  failure,  injury,  legal  jeopardy  or  unacceptable  fraud,  waste  or  abuse.    The waiver authority is the MAJCOM/CC (delegable no lower than MAJCOM Director). 1.6.1.4.  “Tier  3”    (T-3):    Non-compliance  with  this  requirement  may  limit  mission  or program effectiveness or efficiency and has a relatively remote potential to create risk of mission or program failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste, or abuse.  The waiver authority is the Wing / DRU / FOA CC (delegable no lower than Group/CC or equivalent). 1.7.  Terms Explained: 1.6.1.  Will and Shall indicate a mandatory requirement. 1.6.2.  Should indicates non-mandatory desired or preferred method of accomplishment. 1.6.3.  May  indicates  an  acceptable  or  suggested  means  of  accomplishment.  WARNING: Operating procedures, techniques, etc., which may result in personal injury or loss of life if not  carefully  followed.      CAUTION:  Operating  procedures,  techniques,  etc.,  which  may result  in  damage  to  equipment  if  not  carefully  followed.        NOTE:  Operating  procedures, techniques, etc., which are essential to emphasize. 1.8.  Development  of  New  Equipment  and  Procedures.  Units  desiring  to  use  new  or  not previously approved equipment, to include mission equipment, must obtain  AETC/A2/3/10, and Warner  Robins-Air  Logistics  Center  (WR-ALC)  approval  via  AF  Form  1067,  Modification Proposal, prior to testing and/or use.

Support to Civil Authorities/Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies. 2.2.1.  Military  Support  to  Civil  Authorities.  Request  for  helicopter  support  by  civil authorities will be handled IAW AFI 10-802, Military Support to Civil Authorities. Mission approval authority is the wing commander (or equivalent). 2.2.2.  Assistance  to  Civilian  Law  Enforcement  Agencies.  In  general,  military  units  are prohibited by law from participating in civil law enforcement activities (this does not include SAR requests from law enforcement agencies). See AFI 10-801, Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement  Agencies,  USC  Title  10  Chapter  18,  Military  Support  for  Civilian  Law Enforcement  Agencies  or  consult  with  your  Judge  Advocates  office  for  more  information. Report all requests for assistance and coordinate all requests from  civilian law enforcement authorities through appropriate command and control channels. 2.2.3.  Approval  authority  to  carry  civilian  law  enforcement  or  medical  personnel  on  each and  Rescue  (SAR)  or  Medical  Evacuation  (MEDEVAC)  missions  may  be  delegated  to aircraft  commanders  under  certain  circumstances.  If  the  Aircraft  Commander  (AC) determines passengers are essential for the successful completion of the mission, and they are unable  to  contact  their  controlling  agency  for  approval,  passengers  may  be  carried  on  the segments  of  flight  requiring  their  presence.  Leave  a  copy  of  the  passenger  manifest  with  a responsible person IAW AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules. 2.2.4.  Utilization  of  Civilian  Law  Enforcement  or  Medical  Personnel.  Civilian  law enforcement  or  medical  personnel  may  be  required  to  perform  duties  at  an  incident  site. These  duties  may removal. Local/international  laws  may  affect  mission  prosecution  and  should  be  reviewed  prior  to deployment/pickup  of  civilian  personnel.  Units  will  publish  any  local  restrictions  and procedures.  This  may  be  accomplished  in  either  a  command  or  unit  supplement  to  this instruction. include  death  determination  or  human remains 2.2.5.  Human Remains. Rescue personnel should not normally remove human remains from crash or incident sites. The decision to remove the remains from the site will be made solely by the local authorities. Do not commit resources to body removal until the mission approval and/or releasing authority (normally the Wing/Group Commander) has been informed of the request  and  has  approved  the  use  of  resources.  The  AC  is  responsible  for  the  safety  of resources  and  should  not  jeopardize  them  for  body  recovery.  The  AC  is  responsible  for compliance with all directions given by local civil authorities concerning the proper removal and  handling  of  remains  in  that  jurisdiction.  Written  authorization  from  the  proper  local authorities should be received prior to removal; however factors such as accessibility to the area,  weather  conditions,  darkness,  etc.  may  preclude  the  practicality  of  receiving  written authorization from local authorities. In such cases, a verbal authorization may be accepted if followed by a written authorization. AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   11  2.3.  Primary  Crewmembers.

Both ADCs are required for all phases of flight. 8. To accept an aircraft for flight all three MFD’s must be operational. For a mission already in progress, if one MFD fails, the crew may elect to continue the mission. Two failed MFDs (one pilot’s still working) require the flight to return to base. 2.8.  Passengers.  When  the  squadron  is  tasked  to  fly  with  passengers  on  board,  follow  the requirements  of  DoD  4515.13  and  AFI  11-401,  Aviation  Management,  and  applicable supplements. Passengers will (T-2):   14  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 2.8.1.  Be  escorted  through  the  safe  approach  zone  when  the  aircraft  is  being  on-  or  off- loaded  with  rotors  turning.    The  aircraft  commander  or  designated  representative  will  brief passengers on procedures to be followed. 2.8.2.  Not  occupy  a  cockpit  seat  with  the  engine  running  unless  authorized  via  a  formal orientation request, according to AFI 11-401 and appropriate supplements. 2.8.3.  Receive egress, aircraft familiarization, and EP briefings. 2.8.4.  Have access to hearing protection, provided by aircrew prior to flight. 2.8.5.  When  passengers  are  in  the  cargo  compartment,  the  cargo  doors  will  remain  closed during flight unless an aircrew member is also in the cabin. 2.8.6.  Off-  and  on-load  for  crew  changes  are  authorized  while  rotors  are  turning.  The  new crew will review aircraft forms, weight and balance, and TOLD prior to takeoff. 2.8.7.  Restrictions.  Simulated  emergency  procedures  are  not  authorized  with  passengers onboard.  Passengers will be restrained by the safest means possible while still enabling the supported passenger to accomplish their mission. PIC will ensure supported forces are given a  safety  briefing  and  are  familiar  with  the  mission  profile  and  events  before  the  flight.    Exception:  This  restriction  does  not  apply  to  TH-1H  flight  crew  (Instructors,  flight engineers,  and  students)  that  are  passenger  manifested  on  the  aircraft  as  a  result  of  a precautionary landing. 2.9.  DNIF.  Aircrew who become DNIF will immediately notify the Ops Sup, their Flt/CC, and provide  SARM  with  their  grounding  AF  Form  1042  Medical  Recommendations  for  Flying  or Special  Operational  Duty  or  DA  Form  4186  Medical  Recommendation  for  Flying  Duty. Crewmembers  will  not  be  returned  to  flying  status  until  the  AF  Form  1042  or  DA  Form  4186 clearing them to fly is on file with SARM. AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   15  Chapter 3 AIRCREW PROCEDURES 3.1.  Responsibilities.  The  responsibility  for  mission  planning/preparation  is  shared  jointly  by the individual aircrew members. 3.2.  Aircraft  Commander  Responsibility  and  Authority.  All  flights  will  have  an  aircraft commander designated on a flight authorization form, or equivalent, in accordance with AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, as supplemented by MAJCOMs. Aircraft commanders are: 3.2.1.  In command of all persons aboard the aircraft, vested with the authority necessary to manage their crew and accomplish the mission. 3.2.2.  Responsible for the welfare of the crew and the safe accomplishment of the mission. This  begins  upon  notification  and  terminates  upon  mission  completion.  If  the  aircraft commander  determines  that  conditions  are  not  safe  to  execute  the  mission,  the  aircraft  will not depart until the condition is corrected. 3.2.3.  The final mission authority and will make decisions not specifically assigned to higher authority. 3.2.4.  Charged  with  keeping  the  applicable  commander  informed  concerning  mission progress and/or difficulties. And has the final authority for asking for and accepting waivers affecting the crew or mission. 3.2.5.  Responsible for ensuring aircraft security when away from home station. 3.2.6.  The focal point for interaction between aircrew and mission support personnel. 3.2.7.  Required  to  debrief  maintenance  personnel  on  the  condition  of  the  aircraft  and equipment. (T-2) 3.3.  Flight Engineer Responsibilities: 3.3.1.  General. This section contains normal procedures for flight engineers not contained in the flight manual and/or applicable Technical Order. If flight engineers are not being used for the mission, the pilot not flying will complete the requirements of this section. 3.3.2.  Flight  Engineer  Station.  The  flight  engineer  station  is  defined  as  any  position  other than  the  Pilot  seat.    Due  to  the  diverse  mission  of  a  TH-1H  flight  engineer,  duties  may  be conducted  from  any  station  in  the  aircraft,  with  the  exception  of  EP  flights  when  the  flight engineer  should  occupy  the  Jump  Seat  position.  Instructor  flight  engineers  will  be  secured IAW paragraph 4.6.3 of this AFI. 3.3.3.  Aircraft  Systems  Management.  The  flight  engineer  will  monitor  aircraft  systems during ground and flight operations unless the mission dictates otherwise. Notify the pilot of all abnormal indications and take action as directed. 3.4.  Mass  Aircrew  Briefings.  The  Operations  Supervisor  or  designated  representative  will conduct the daily briefing and ensure all instructors are thoroughly briefed on mission execution and potential hazards. Student mass briefs are a required part of the Go/No-Go process. Aircrew on  Continuation  Training  (CT)  sorties  should  attend  applicable  portions  of  scheduled  student mass brief to ensure they comply with go/no-go procedures. If no student briefs are scheduled at   16  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 CT  sortie  brief  times,  IPs  will  ensure  that  they  review  the  mass  brief  during  their  crew  brief. Student mass aircrew briefings will begin with a time hack given by a student at the scheduled brief time. As a minimum, all items in the mass brief are IAW AFI 11-418. 3.5.  Crew  Briefing/Debriefing  Requirements.  Refer  to  AFI  11-2TH-1H  Vol  3  CL1  for briefings.  The  aircraft  commander  or  flight  lead  is  responsible  for  presenting  a  logical  briefing that  will  promote  safe,  effective  mission  accomplishment,  as  well  as,  ensuring  appropriate mission/event briefings are completed prior to accomplishment. Mission elements/events may be modified  and  briefed  airborne  as  long  as  flight  safety  is  not  compromised.  Flight  lead/aircraft commanders  will  ensure  changes  are  acknowledged  by  all  flight  members/crewmembers.  If feasible,  an  alternate  mission  will  be  briefed.  The  alternate  mission  must  be  less  complex  than the primary mission.  Additionally aircraft commanders and/or flight leads will: 3.5.1.  Ensure all crewmembers/passengers attend the briefing unless previously coordinated with  squadron  supervisors  and  aircraft  commander/flight  lead.  Anyone  not  attending  the flight  briefing  must  receive  a  briefing  on  mission  events,  duties  and  emergency  procedures prior to flight. (T-2) 3.5.2.  Ensure  specific  items  pertinent  to  all  mission  events  are  covered.  Those  items understood  by  all  participants,  and  written  in  squadron  standards,  may  be  briefed  as “standard”. 3.5.3.  When  dissimilar  aircraft  are  flown  in  formation,  brief  flight  responsibilities,  proper formation  position  (minimum  rotor  separation  based  on  the  largest  rotor  diameter),  aircraft unique capabilities, tactics, limitations and requirements for each phase of flight. 3.5.4.  All  missions  will  be  debriefed.  Consider  using  approved,  portable  PFPS  trails  to enhance capturing lesson’s learned. 3.5.5.  Prior to each flight the aircraft commander will ensure all passengers are briefed IAW AFI 11-2TH-1H Vol 3 CL1 and applicable AETC guidance (See paragraph 2.8). 3.5.6.  Complete  Operational  Risk  Management  prior  to  flight  and  update  throughout  the sortie as risk factors change. Evaluate risk and mitigate appropriately for the flight.  Aircraft commanders will ensure the OPS Sup is briefed before stepping. 3.5.7.  Ensure aircrew review the FCIF before departure on all missions. The FCIF contains reference  material  appropriate  for  squadron  operations  as  designated  by  the  OG/CC.  An electronic equivalent  may  be used. The aircraft commander will provide an FCIF update to all crewmembers who are delinquent in their FCIF review or who join a mission en route. (T-0) 3.6.  Post Flight Debriefing.  The aircraft commander of each flight will give each crewmember the opportunity to discuss unusual aspects of the mission.  These debriefings may be formal or informal, as the situation requires. (T-2) 3.6.1.  For  training  flights,  the  instructor  will  review  and  evaluate  the  overall  training performed,  advise  the  student  of  future  training  requirements,  answer  technical  questions, and complete student grade sheets. (T-2) 3.7.  Maintenance  Debriefing.  As  soon  as  possible  after  arrival,  the  aircraft  commander  and other required crewmembers will debrief maintenance on the condition of the aircraft. AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   17  3.8.  Weather  Minimums.  Forecast  and  observed  weather  (prevailing)  must  meet  minimums specified.  Prior to  takeoff, ensure  an appropriate course of action is  identified (and briefed) in the event of an emergency after takeoff. (T-2) 3.8.1.  All VFR training flights require a 700-foot ceiling and 2 statute miles (SM) visibility (T-2), except: 3.8.1.1.  Night,  NVG,  Student  Cross-Country,  and  student  team  flights  require  a  1,000-foot ceiling and 3 SM visibility. 3.8.2.  If observed or forecast weather conditions deteriorate below the specified minimums, terminate  training  by  recovering  to  an  airfield  or  landing  the  aircraft.  (T-0)  If  weather improves during recovery or landing, training may continue.        NOTE: Weather minimums in  paragraphs  3.8.1  and  3.8.1.1  do  not  apply  to  hover  and  air  taxi  operations  at  the aerodrome. Hover/Taxi  training at  the aerodrome is  authorized if observed WX is less than VFR training minimums. When conducting hover/taxi training when weather is below VFR training  minimums  the  aerodrome  control  tower  must  be  operational  and  the  aircrew  will remain in visual contact with the control tower. 3.8.3.  Special  VFR.  Special  VFR  recovery  minimums  are  300-½  for  day,  500-1  for  night. Special VFR departures below 700-2 day, or any time at night are not authorized. 3.8.3.1.  For SVFR departures, contact Clearance Delivery to coordinate clearance. 3.8.4.  Surface  wind  limits  are  30  knots  or  less,  or  a  gust  spread  of  15  knots.    For  student team  sorties,  the  wind  limits  are  20  knots  or  less  (including  gusts),  or  a  gust  spread  of  10 knots. (T-2) 3.8.5.  The primary source for weather information is the Cairns AAF weather station. Their forecasts  take  priority  over  any  other  weather  reporting/forecasting  agency.  Weather Warnings  and  Advisories  are  available  via  the  Local  Weather  Data  Set  (LWDS).  The Mission  Execution  Forecast  is  published  for  the  local  area  on  Fort  Rucker’s  Weather Operations Webpage three times a day. If a hard copy DD 175-1 forecast is required, crews will contact base weather the day prior. Request information on off-station missions directly through the weather shop the day prior, to ensure timely briefings. 3.9.  Adverse Weather: 3.9.1.  Weather Warning (WW). A weather warning will be issued  for  forecast or observed weather conditions within a 15 NM radius of Cairns AAF that may pose a hazard to property or  life.  A  weather  warning  is  not  prohibitive  for  flight  or  training.  This  issuance  does  not require  pilots  to  recover  early,  only  to  be  in  a  position  to  respond  to  changing  weather conditions. 3.9.2.  Terminal  Weather  Advisory  (TWA).  The  Cairns  AAF  weather  station  will  issue  a TWA  when  an  established  weather  condition  that  could  affect  aircraft  operations  exists within  a  15  NM  radius  of  Cairns  AAF.  A  TWA  is  a  forecast;  pilots  will  consider  it accordingly. 3.9.3.  Area  Weather  Advisories  (AWA).  The  Cairns  AAF  weather  station  will  issue  an AWA  when  weather  conditions  could  affect  aircraft  operations  or  are  expected  to  occur within 60 NM of Cairns AAF. AWAs issued for IFR conditions in low-lying drainages is a forecast for predominantly IFR conditions in the vicinity of large bodies of water and large   18  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 rivers. Pilots will consider this a segmented forecast for the 60 NM local flying area (LFA). Aircraft may launch and train provided they avoid the affected low-lying areas. 3.9.4.  NVG  Adverse  Weather.  If  the  forecast  prevailing  weather  in  the  applicable  training area is  below 1000/3,  the aircraft  commander shall plan to  depart the  affected training area prior to the conditions falling below minimums or return to the aerodrome. If the weather at the recovery aerodrome is forecast to go below 1000/3, aircrew will recover to the aerodrome 30  minutes  prior  to  the  forecast  conditions.          NOTE:  Local  weather  can  deteriorate  in  a short  period  of  time.  While  it  may  be  feasible  to  continue  training  in  the  AO,  recovery  to Cairns AAF may not. limitations,  and judgment  after  weighing  safety,  aircraft 3.9.5.  Weather Hold/Recall/Cancel.  In all cases, aircraft  commanders (AC) are expected to exercise  sound training effectiveness.  ACs  will  coordinate  intentions  with  the  Ops  Sup  prior  to  launch.  When necessary  to  ensure  safe  flight  operations  en  route,  ACs  should  not  hesitate  to  land  and contact  Metro/Hub  Radio  (Hub)/Ops  Sup  as  time/radio  reception  permits.  When  weather advisories are received, ACs will obtain more specific information directly from the weather office as necessary. Weather advisories are not automatically limiting, because they usually refer to the possibility for the weather phenomena to occur at some time during the advisory period,  over  a  wide  general  area,  and  may  not  reflect  actual  observations  or  forecasts.  If weather will impact the  mission, ACs  will obtain actual current  and  forecast  conditions  for the intended route of flight,  flight  period, etc. When deteriorating weather conditions  affect flying  operations,  the  squadron  Ops  Sup  will  utilize  all  available  resources  (i.e.,  weather, radar, tower personnel, pilot reports, etc.) to determine the best course of action for squadron aircraft. This course of action could extend to departures and recoveries as well as diverts or weather  recalls.  The  Ops  Sup  will  determine  suitable  weather  alternates,  assign  them accordingly,  and  monitor  them.  The  SQ/CC/DO/ADO  or  Ops  Sup  may  issue  a  weather recall/hold/cancel based on forecast, hazardous weather reports, or observed conditions. 3.9.6.  Thunderstorms. Flight may be made into areas of known or forecast thunderstorms if visual meteorological conditions (VMC) are maintained and thunderstorm activity is avoided by a minimum of 5 nautical miles (NM).  Do not fly into rain shafts beneath cumulonimbus clouds. (T-0) 3.10.  Sunset.  During  certain  times  of  the  year,  the  PM  downtime  is  after  official  sunset. Instructors may continue to train students in support of the syllabus for 15 minutes past official sunset. This does not include emergency procedures training. 3.11.  Flight Plans.  Crews operating in Fort Rucker Training area will use flight authorizations as local VFR flight plans for all VFR flights departing the aerodrome, flight following with Hub Radio,  and  terminating  at  the  aerodrome.  Other  flights  departing  the  aerodrome  and  the  Hub service  area  require  filing  a  DD  Form  175,  Military  Flight  Plan  or  civilian  equivalent.  If  base operations is not open, crews will file appropriate flight plans with flight service. (T-3) 3.11.1.  The local flying area consists of a surveyed low-level area and outer areas up to 200 NM  radius  from  Ft  Rucker  but  not  to  exceed  autorotational  distance  from  shore.  This  area includes Columbus AFB MS, Moody AFB GA and Hurlburt Field FL. The boundary for the surveyed low level area is annotated by the yellow line and hazards to flight are posted on the Master CHUM JOG. AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   19  3.12.  Fuel  Planning.  Aircraft  commanders  must  plan  to  arrive  at  their  destination  with  a minimum fuel reserve of 250 pounds (for both VFR and IFR). (T-2) 3.12.1.  Fuel  Management.  Crews  should  use  600  lbs/hour  as  the  planned  fuel  burn  rate  an hour as a worst case fuel burn rate for any calculations that need to be completed. On flights that  require  the  use  of  an  AF  IMT  70,  Pilot’s  Flight  Plan  and  Flight  Log,  aircrew  will monitor fuel  status  throughout  the sortie and calculate fuel  burns rates as  necessary. Crews will also brief and monitor BINGO fuel and JOKER fuel. 3.12.2.  Bingo  Fuel.  Bingo  Fuel  according  to  the  Joint  Brevity  words  is  defined  as  the  fuel state needed for recovery.  This is further defined as the minimum computed fuel required at a point in flight that will allow a safe return to a refueling point (with required reserve fuel).  Bingo fuels will be calculated using a direct route from the last RT or point of loiter to the planned  recovery  location  with  required  reserves.    For  cross-country  planning,  bingo  fuel should be calculated as the half-way point between intended refuel on a point to point flight.  This  guidance  is  for  planning  at  the  table  and  does  not  preclude  or  account  for  various circumstances  that  may  occur  during  flight  (wx  divert,  nav  divert,  accomplishing  training objectives,  etc.)  in  which  the  crew  would  need  to  change/update  the  bingo  for  the  nearest suitable  refuel  location.          NOTE:  Corridors  should  be  considered  when  calculating BINGO/JOKER fuel due to the inability to proceed direct to the aerodrome. 3.12.3.  Joker  Fuel.  Joker  fuel  is  defined  as  the  fuel  state  above  Bingo  at  which separation/bugout/event termination should begin. This fuel will be the amount described as “TOT REMG” on the AF IMT Form 70. Missions will be planned to match sortie duration as depicted  on  syllabus.  Crews  shall  plan  joker  fuels  at  each  point  of  loiter to  aide  in  mission management.  Formation crews will also plan lead change joker fuels as required. 3.12.4.  Continuation  Fuel.  Continuation  fuel  is  the  minimum  fuel  required  to  complete  the mission, as planned, and to land at the destination with the required fuel reserves. This fuel will be the amount described as “CONT. FUEL” on the AF IMT Form 70. 3.12.5.  Fuel  Conservation.  Aircrew  will  manage  aviation  fuel  as  a  limited  commodity  and precious  resource.  Aircrew  will  also  design  procedures  for  optimal  fuel  use  and  efficiency throughout  all  phases  of  mission  execution,  to  include  ground  ops,  flight  profiles.  (T-3) Incorporate  en  route  tasks  to  make  maximum  use  of  airborne  training  opportunities. Terminate the sortie when mission and training objectives are met. 3.13.  Weight and Balance. 3.13.1.  Verify the canned weight and balance was calculated with the past year. 3.13.2.  Compute a new or corrected form if the initial takeoff weight changes by more than 500  pounds.    For  configuration  changes  of  less  than  500  pounds,  the  aircraft  commander ensures the resulting center of gravity is within limits. (T-1) 3.13.3.  When  available,  student  Flight  Engineers  will  compute  a  new  Weight  and  Balance for all flights prior to aircrew brief. 3.14.  TOLD.  The same TOLD will suffice for consecutive takeoffs and landings when aircraft gross weight or environmental conditions have not increased significantly; that is, by 200 pounds gross  weight,  5  degrees  Celsius,  or  500  feet  pressure  altitude  (PA).  Flight  Engineers  will  be primary for computing and updating TOLD inflight unless otherwise specified by the AC.   20  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 3.14.1.  Complete takeoff and landing data (TOLD) prior to takeoff, and, whenever possible, prior to the aircrew briefing. (T-2) 3.14.2.  In aircraft not modified by TCTO-526, Calibrated torque values must be converted to indicated torque using the engine calibration factor (provided by MX in the aircraft forms). This will be accomplished prior to flight and/or every time torque is recomputed in flight if necessary. 3.14.3.  Use Figure A-2. Maximum Torque Available (5 Minute Operation) in TO 1H-1(T)H-1 for all TH-1H computed power available values. 3.14.4.  Aircrew will use worst case weather (PA and temp) when computing hover ceiling. Use Figure A-7. Hover Ceiling in Ground Effect (IGE) (Continuous Operation) – Heater Off and  Figure  A-11.  Hover  Ceiling  Out  of  Ground  Effect  (OGE)  (Continuous  Operation)  – Heater Off in  TO 1H-1(T)H-1.  If the calculated  gross  weight  for either  IGE or  OGE hover does  not  meet  requirements  for  the  mission,  run  the  respective  Hover  Ceiling  chart  for  5-minute operation. 3.14.5.  Takeoff  and  Landing/Worst  Case  data.  For  Worst  Case  data  on  local  area  flights, crews will use the max area temp and max area PA from the most current Mission Execution Forecast  (MEF)  available  for  mission  planning.  If  a  new  MEF  is  released  after  TOLD  has been  calculated,  use  criteria  in  paragraph  3.14  to  determine  whether  TOLD  should  be recalculated or at the IP/IF’s discretion.      NOTE: If max temp and PA are unavailable from the MEF, crews will use takeoff temp plus 5 degrees C and takeoff PA plus 500 feet. 3.15.  Altitude Restrictions: 3.15.1.  Conduct all operations at or above 300 feet above ground level (AGL) except when lower altitudes are required for takeoff, landing, and operations in approved areas or routes. 3.15.2.  The  minimum  altitude  for  low-level  training  is  100  feet  above  highest  obstacle (AHO). 3.15.3.  Avoid buildings, farm-related facilities, and structures by 500-foot slant range. (T-3) 3.16.  Maps.  Pilots will plan flights and fly with current maps, including the most recent edition of the squadron hazards map.  Squadron safety will maintain a 1:250,000 joint operations graphic (JOG) hazards map with updates from the chart updating manual (CHUM) posted. (T-3) 3.16.1.  Monthly/Quarterly  Inspection of Training Areas (MITA/QITA) Use the appropriate source document for RT availability and information. The squadron safety officer will ensure a  current  copy  of  MITA/QITA  is  available  for  crews  during  mission  planning.  Crews  will check the MITA/QITA, as it applies to their planned sites, prior to each flight. 3.16.2.  De-confliction  Map.  Students  will  post  their  RT  information  on  the  de-confliction maps located in the mission planning room prior to each flight. 3.16.3.  Map  Preparation.  All  local  area  maps  used  for  navigation  will  be  posted  with  the current  Chart  Updating  Manual  (CHUM)  as  reflected  on  the  Master  CHUM  JOG  and  will include  all  avoid  areas,  remote  sites,  reporting  points,  etc.  The  current  CHUM  date  will  be posted  on  each  map.  For  normal  student  training,  instructors  will  be  the  quality  control reviewers for tactical preparation.           NOTE: 1:50,000 maps and PFPS imagery must be CHUM’d  using  the  current  1:250,000  JOG  map  and/or  computerized  E-CHUM’d  flight AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   21  planning maps and annotated appropriately. Routes will include planning from initial takeoff to final landing. Maps will be printed from the printers in the mission planning room only. 3.16.3.1.  Map Scale Reduction/Enlarging. Students will NOT print maps for navigation that  have  been  reduced  or  enlarged  in  size  to  fit  a  certain  size  of  paper.            NOTE: Reduced/enlarged  scaling  creates  a  picture  of  a  map  and  is  detrimental  to  nav-divert scenarios,  basic  navigation,  threat  plot,  and  tend  to  lead  to  common  clock-to-map-to-ground errors. 3.16.3.2.  Falconview  Overlays.  Falconview  mission  maps  will  be  prepared  with  the following standard format (overlays selected and in following order). 3.16.3.2.1.  Mission route 3.16.3.2.2.  23.

Route  corridor  –  500’  above  the  highest  obstruction  to  flight  within  5 NM  of  route  centerline  to  include  the  aircraft  turn  radius.  Use  an  Emergency  Safe Altitude (ESA) of 3100’ for the Fort Rucker training area.  For all flights out of the local area, calculate the Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA) IAW AFMAN 11-217V2. 3.16.3.3.1.  Course Line and Time or Distance Marks. Draw course lines for the entire route  inbound  to  the  objective  and  continue  on  to  portray  the  return  route.  Time marks should be placed on the right side of the course line; distance marks should be placed on the left side of the course line.   22  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 Figure 3.1.  Course Line and Time or Distance Marks.  3.16.3.3.2.  Way Point. Use a circle to depict en route points where the aircraft course is  altered  or  key  actions  occur.  Label  way  points  consecutively  to  facilitate identification.  Place  corresponding  Doghouses  immediately  adjacent  to  the  course line. Figure 3.2.  Way Point.  3.16.3.3.3.  Initial Point (IP). The IP is identified by a square centered on the point. Figure 3.3.  Initial Point (IP).  3.16.3.3.4.  Objective Point. The objective point is identified by a triangle centered on the planned point with the apex pointing in the direction of flight. Figure 3.4.  Objective Point.  3.16.3.4.  Doghouses. Doghouses are designed to give the crew the required navigational data from the present way point to the next way point. 3.16.3.4.1.  Block 1.  Numeric designator of the next way point. 3.16.3.4.2.

Doghouses.  3.16.3.5.  Route Planning. Select  routes that will avoid  hazards and, if possible, provide safe areas for a precautionary landing. Select routes as follows: 3.16.3.5.1.  Avoid  flying  parallel  to  wires  with  less  than  1/2  NM  lateral  clearance. Flights  over  wires  should  be  at  supporting  structures  or  wire  marking  devices.  All microwave, radio, TV and other tall towers will be avoided by 1/2 NM and clear of supporting or “guy” wires. 3.16.3.5.2.  Monitor RT frequencies when transitioning within 2 NM and below 800’ MSL.  Make an appropriate traffic call to RT’s when transitioning within 1/2 NM and below 800’ MSL 3.16.3.5.3.  Aircraft  transitioning  through  or  training  in  active  NOE  boxes  or  route will remain 200’ AHO or higher. If operating in the confines of the NOE box below 800’  MSL,  an  advisory  radio  call  is  required.  NOE  boxes  will  always  be  treated  as active. 3.16.3.5.4.  For tactical sorties, avoid a direct routing to the objective. Plan sufficient course  changes  for  navigational  training  to  the  objective.  If  possible,  do  not  use  the same routing for ingress and egress. Heading changes should be 60 degrees or less. 3.16.3.5.5.  Normally, do not exceed 20 NM between checkpoints for dead reckoning. The type of terrain will dictate the selection and distances between checkpoints. 3.16.3.5.6.  Establish  an  IP  over  a  prominent  feature  that  is  easily  identifiable  from low altitudes. The IP is a point near LZs over which final course alterations are made to arrive at the specified objective. The distance from the IP to the objective will vary with  the  situation,  but  should  be  approximately  3  to  12  NM  from  the  objective  for training.  Attempt  to  select  an  IP  that  can  be  over  flown  on  the  inbound  heading, minimizing turns from the last leg flown (recommended 30 degrees or less).    NOTE: The  following  are  minimums  to  brief  during  the  en-route  portion:  Turn  direction, hazards  within  3NM  of  route,  funneling  features,  turn  point  description,  and  barrier features.  For all turns greater than 60 degrees, discuss turn mitigation. 3.17.  Form  70.  Prepare  an  AF  IMT  70  for  each  contact,  instrument,  navigation,  remote,  low-level,  and  NVG  mission.    As  a  minimum,  the  form  70  will  include  turn  points,  headings, distances,  estimated  times  of  arrival  (ETA),  minimum  safe  altitudes  (MSA),  and  fuel computations.                NOTE: Canned form 70s are allowed for contact sorties 3.17.1.  For student cross country and remote flights, use the AF IMT 70, Pilot’s Flight Plan and Flight Log, or a more detailed navigation log. (T-3)   24  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 3.17.2.  Students will use the most current approved electronic Form 70. The electronic Form 70 will be used on all flights after the Day Remote phase. Students may not modify this form or export the form to Excel, etc. 3.18.  Mission Smart Pack.  Students will prepare the most current approved smart pack for all Cross-Country, Remote, Low-level, Formation and NVG sorties. A copy of the smart pack will be provided to all crewmembers. 3.18.1.  The Smart Pack will be ordered as follows: squadron approved frag, IMT Form 70, WETPASTE diagrams (as applicable), airfield diagrams (as applicable), and TOLD cards. 3.18.2.  RT  WETPASTE  diagrams  will  be  included  in  the  mission  pack  for  student  tactical and formation  sorties. WETPASTE diagrams  will be filled out  completely and will include power requirements for the maneuvers being flown and landing spots/direction. Approaches will be briefed and flown to the touchdown location unless overriding circumstances become a  factor.  WETPASTE  diagrams  DO  NOT  replace  AF4303  Helicopter  Landing  Zone  Surveys and crews will check RT currency and the AF 4303 prior to the mass brief. 3.18.3.  Tactical  and  formation  refuel  diagrams  are  not  required  but  will  be  briefed  to  the crew(s) with the same level of detail. 3.19.  Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations: 3.19.1.  Required Documentation. Before applying power to the aircraft or operating aircraft systems,  review  the  AFTO  Form  781,  ARMS  Aircrew/Mission  Flight  Data  Document.    An authorized  maintenance  person  (or  the  aircraft  commander  when  off-station)  must  sign  the exceptional  release  before  flight.    The  fuel  identaplate  or  AIRCARD  (aviation  credit  card) must be aboard the aircraft when off-station refueling is planned or required. 3.19.2.  Refueling.  At  locations  with  refueling  support,  aircrew  will  not  personally accomplish  the  refueling  unless  extenuating  circumstances  dictate.  (T-3)  When  not  directly involved in  the refueling operation, personnel  will  remain at  least  50 feet  from  the aircraft.  Hot  refueling  requires  execution  of  the  hot  refueling  checklist  and  post  hot  refueling checklist. (T-2) 3.19.3.  AIRCARD  Operations.  The  AIRCARD  is  used  to  pay  for  services  at  commercial fixed base operators  (FBO).  These services include aviation  fuel,  aircraft  oil and fluids,  or other  minor  maintenance  items.    Charges  incurred  during  this  routine  aircraft  servicing generate a charge receipt.  The aircraft commander is responsible for ensuring the receipt is correct  and  all  appropriate  signatures  are  obtained  before  departing  the  FBO.    The  aircraft commander then gives all charge receipts to the unit document control officer (DCO) when the mission is complete.  Charges incurred for other services, including landing fees, aircraft de-icing, follow-me trucks, and other airfield-related services might not generate a receipt for the aircrew.  If a receipt is not generated and provided to the aircrew, the aircraft commander will note the location and services performed, and provide the information when submitting receipts  to  the  unit  DCO  after  the  mission  is  complete.  (T-2)  If  a  separate  receipt  is generated, turn it in to the unit DCO. 3.20.  Aircrew Uniforms and Protective Devices: AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   25  3.20.1.  When  reporting  for  flying  duties,  all  crewmembers  will  wear  appropriate  flight clothing  and  carry  a  set  of  identification  (ID)  tags  on  their  person.    Civilian  contract  flyers must abide by local contract requirements. (T-2) 3.20.2.  The  pilot  will  ensure  sufficient  quantities  of  appropriate  serviceable  aircrew  flight equipment,  survival  equipment,  and  protective  clothing  are  aboard the  aircraft.  Crewmembers will wear survival vests on all flights. (T-3) 3.20.3.  Aircrew  members  will  wear  reflective  belts  from  official  sunset  to  official  sunrise and should wear reflective belts while on the flight line during periods of reduced visibility.  Reflective materials will not be permanently attached or affixed to flight clothing. (T-3)   26  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 Chapter 4 NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 4.1.  Instructor  Requirements.  The  student  to  instructor  ratio  should  not  exceed  2  to  1.    The squadron director of operations (DO) has waiver authority.  All IPs are safety observers and are responsible for their students’ actions. 4.2.  Pre-Step  Requirements.  The  flight  authorization  will  be  signed  by  the  authenticating official  and  initialed  by  a  SARM  representative  and  the  aircraft  commander.    The  SARM representative  and  aircraft  commander’s  initials  signify  completion  of  Go/No-Go  checks.  In addition, the aircraft commander’s initials signify completion of the operational risk management (ORM)  assessment.  When  crewmember(s)  are  added  to  the  flight  authorization,  the  aircraft commander is required to check Go/No-Go status for the additional crewmember(s) and sign in the  appropriate  section,  certifying  the  check  has  been  accomplished.    Any  changes  will  be coordinated through the Ops Sup and approved by Top 3 IAW AFI 11-418. 4.2.1.  Aircraft commanders will conduct a brief with the Ops Sup in person or via telephone before takeoff. 4.3.  Aircraft  and  Line Changes.  Aircrew will notify the Ops Sup of aircraft changes prior to takeoff. The Ops Sup will coordinate for Top 3 initials of flight authorization changes. 4.3.1.  Aircraft  commanders  do  not  have  the  authority  to  add  lines.  All  cancellations  and additions will be coordinated with the Ops Sup, who will then coordinate with the Top 3 and maintenance as required. 4.4.  Prohibited Maneuvers.  Do not intentionally accomplish actual engine shutdown in flight, blade stall, or vortex ring state in the aircraft. 4.5.  Checklist.  Use  the  challenge  (read)  and  response  (accomplish)  method  when  using  the checklist. During EPs, the crewmember reading the checklist will read the entire step (challenge and response). (Note: The appropriate response is listed in the checklist. If the listed response is “as  required,”  the  response  should  be  the  current  setting.)  The  crewmember  who  is accomplishing  the  step  will  repeat  the  response.  A  checklist  is  not  complete  until  all  items  are completed in sequence. (T-2) 4.6.  Seatbelts. 4.6.1.  The  pilot  on  the  controls  has  his  or  her  seatbelt  and  shoulder  harness  fastened  when rotors are turning. (T-1) 4.6.2.  When doors are open during flight, all occupants in the cabin area will wear a seatbelt or gunner’s belt. (T-1) 4.6.3.  When doors are closed during flight, the aircraft commander may direct crewmembers to  perform  duties  in  the  cabin  unrestrained  for  brief  periods,  as  required.  TH-1H crewmembers  sitting  in  the  center  observer  seat  may  fly  without  shoulder  straps  if  straps hinder  their  ability  to  perform  aircrew  duties.  The  shoulder  harness  will  be  worn  during actual and simulated emergency procedures. (T-1) AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   27  4.7.  Gunner’s Belt.  Personnel will not use a gunner’s belt unless they have been trained IAW approved  courseware  by  a  qualified  instructor.    All  crewmembers  who  have  completed "1H/POC-7  TH-1H  General  Description"  academic  class  and  received  hands-on  training  by  an Instructor Pilot or Instructor Flight Engineer are authorized to utilize a gunner's belt to facilitate in scanning and securing items in the cabin with the following restrictions (T-1): 4.7.1.  Instructors and Student Flight Engineers (SF) are allowed to check out a gunner's belt for all sortie profiles. 4.7.2.  During  EP's,  all  personnel  in  the  cargo  compartment  should  be  restrained  by  a seatbelt.    Instructor  Pilot/Flight  Engineers  may  use  a  gunner’s  belt  if  it  is  the  only  way  of enabling them to accomplish their specific duties. 4.7.3.  The gunner's belt will be attached to a centralized floor ring. The gunner's belt will not be  disconnected  or  lengthened  to  a  point  that  would  allow  the  wearer  to  fall  outside  the aircraft. 4.7.4.  The gunner's belt must be properly secured to the individual and to the aircraft prior to the  HOVER/TAXI  CHECKLIST.  The  Aircraft  Commander  (AC)/Instructors  (IP/IF)  must also visually check security and proper length. 4.7.5.  Anytime  the  rotors  are  turning,  prior  to  unfastening  the  seat  belt  or  5-point  harness, with the gunner's belt on, crewmembers must secure or stow all checklists/guides and receive approval from the IP/AC (e.g. “cleared on gunner's belt"). 4.7.6.  Due to the crash worthiness of the jump seat this will be the primary seating position in the event of an emergency, if available. 4.7.7.  When operating at an RT, the jump seat occupant, can move from his or her seat, with the gunner's belt fastened, and clear the tail down. When cabin doors are closed, students will visually scan out the window. 4.7.8.  The cabin doors may be opened when the aircraft is below 50KIAS, the crewmember is  secured  by  a  gunner’s  and  the  crewmember  has  received  clearance  from  AC/IP  to  open doors  (e.g.  “cleared  to  open  doors”).    The  doors  must  be  secured/pinned  opened  or  closed completely prior to reaching 50KIAS on takeoff/go-around. 4.8.  Radios. 4.8.1.  The  pilot  informs  the  crew  which  radio  is  primary.    All  crewmembers  monitor  the primary radio unless the aircraft commander specifically directs otherwise. (T-0) 4.8.2.  All  crewmembers  listen  to  the  intercom.    The  aircraft  commander  must  provide clearance  prior  to  going  off  the  intercom.  (T-0)  During  critical  phases  of  flight,  limit transmissions within the aircraft to those essential for crew coordination. 4.8.3.  Monitor  ground  frequency  prior  to  engine  start.    Contact  ground  control  for  engine start clearance when required. 4.9.  Flight  Following/Position  Reporting.  VFR position reporting or flight following with an appropriate  agency  (Hub,  flight  service  station  [FSS],  air  traffic  control  [ATC]),  or  another aircraft  is  required  for  all  flights.  Aircrew  conducting  formation  flights  should  establish  flight following with an agency or aircraft outside of their formation.   28  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 4.9.1.  Hub Radio. Hub radio is the focal point for local VFR position reporting. 4.9.1.1.  Once clear of corridor or airspace, aircrew will contact Hub. 4.9.1.2.  When making initial contact with Hub following departure from a corridor, use the Hub frequency that is reflected in the sector of the destination RT. A diagram of the Hub frequency sectors may be found on the squadron low level hazards map. Upon initial contact with Hub relay the following information: Call sign, aircraft type, last 4 digits of tail number, number of personnel on board (POB), position, and destination/intentions. 4.9.1.3.  After initial contact is made, continue to update Hub with call sign, position, and destination.  Make  positive  radio  contact  with  Hub  at  least  every  25  minutes  unless another  time  period  is  specified  by  Hub  that  is  more  restrictive.  If  contact  time  will exceed 30 minutes, notify Hub of estimated time of next contact. 4.9.1.4.  Advise  Hub  of  any  unusual  events  or  if  significant  weather  is  encountered  but not forecasted and pertinent to other aircraft. Significant weather will also be reported to Cairns AAF Metro, via Pilot Reports (PIREPs), as able. 4.9.2.  Hub  Radio  non-availability.  The  following  coordination  will  be  made  for  all  flights when Hub radio is closed. 4.9.2.1.  For  local  flying  aircrew  will  flight  follow  via  interplane  with  other  squadron aircraft  (if  available)  or  Approach  Control.  Crews  making  stopovers  will  call  the  Ops Desk and notify SDC/Ops Sup with downtime and ETD. 4.9.2.2.  For  flying  outside  of  the  local  flying  area,  once  launched,  the  Ops  Sup  will  be readily  available  from  the  office  or  home  on  their  cell  phone.  Aircrew  will  use  the Operations desk phone as a point of contact in the remarks section of the DD 175 flight plan that will be used in the event of an overdue aircraft situation. 4.10.  Scanners.  Crewmembers who are not performing basic crew duties will act as scanners to avoid obstacles during ground taxiing and confined-area operations and to reduce the potential of a midair collision during arrivals, departures, and simulated instrument flight. (T-2) 4.11.  Circuit Breakers.  The only circuit breakers authorized to be pulled during training is the dome light breaker for NVG flight and the fuselage lights circuit breaker for NVG formation. Table 4.1.  Aircraft Light Procedures. Flight Phase Anti-collision Lights  Position Lights Landing Light Ground (Rotors Turning or Rotors Untied at Night) Hover/Taxi Airfields within 5 NM / Corridors Enroute ON5 ON ON ON FLASH      BRIGHT5  FLASH     (T-0) BRIGHT1 STEADY  (T-0) BRIGHT STEADY  (T-0) OFF OFF  ON OFF2 AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   29  RT / LZ Terminal Area ON3  Formation Dash Last – ON (T-0) All Others – OFF NOTES: BRIGHT STEADY  (T-0) BRIGHT3,4  STEADY  (T-0) BRIGHT4 As Required2  Lead – ON2 All Others – OFF 1. Position Lights will be Steady Bright when in Hot Gas to reduce risk of static/electric discharge. 2. Landing Light will remain on for all cross country and instrument profiles.  At the LZ the landing light may be turned on for traffic avoidance/deconfliction. 3. Anti-collision lights may be turned off and position lights may be set to DIM during RT/LZ terminal operations if distracting to aircrew (NVGs). (T-2) 4. NVG Formation Ops. Dash Last carries STEADY BRIGHT Position Lights; all other aircraft carry STEADY DIM. Note: With scanners on board, all aircraft in the formation will set position lights to STEADY DIM. The white fuselage lights are incompatible with NVG formation and the circuit breaker will be pulled during NVG formation operations. Both aircraft should have NVG Position lights on Setting #3 and white taillights taped over. 5. Unless power-limited IAW AFI 11-218. For power limited situations that require some kind of light source (other aircraft/personnel/etc.), the anti-collision light drains less power from the battery than the position Lights. 4.12.  Fire Guard Procedures:  It is mandatory to have a fire guard during engine start, except when there are only 2 crewmembers. The fireguard will be posted next to the aircraft (inside the tip path) and in plain view of the pilot during engine starts. After engine start the fireguard will check for leaks or fire and ensure all doors are secured. 4.12.1.  If  there  is  no  fireguard  available  during  engine  start,  the  pilot  in  the  left  seat  will check the engine compartment after engine start. 4.12.2.  Aircrew members performing  fireguard duties will have sleeves down and  fastened over  flight  gloves,  collar  up  and  visor  down.  For  night  flights,  the  fireguard  will  have  a chemlight or NVG compatible flashlight available. 4.12.3.  In case of a fire, the fireguard will make the appropriate hand and arm signals (back and  forth  movement  of  the  hand  across  the  throat)  indicating  an  emergency  shutdown.  At night,  make  the  same  motion  with  a  flashlight  or  chemlight.  In  case  of  fire,  use  the  fire extinguisher to protect the aircrew until they have evacuated the aircraft. 4.13.  Ground  Personnel.  Aircrew  and  ramp  personnel  will  not  enter  or  exit  the  rotor  system while  blades  are  turning  unless  given  a  thumbs  up  (day)  or  signaled  with  a  vertical  movement with a flashlight or chemlight (night) from the pilot on the controls.   30  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 4.13.1.  All personnel will have a chemlight or flashlight on and wear a reflective belt when on  the  a/c  ramps  during  hours  of  darkness.  Reflective  belts  are  not  required  when  in  the immediate vicinity of the aircraft (e.g., preflight, aircraft loading). 4.13.2.  Aircrew  will  ensure  hearing  protection  is  available  on  the  aircraft  prior  to  flight.  A crewmember  will  be  responsible  for  distributing  these  devices  to  all  passengers.  Hearing protection will be worn within 50 feet of operating aircraft. 4.13.3.  Crewmembers will not wear headgear while on the flight line. Stocking caps may be worn on the flight line during cold weather. 4.14.  Starting Engine Checklist.  During the engine start when Ng reaches 40%, the pilot in the right  seat  should  state  the  release  of  the  start  switch  by  saying  “Start  Switch  Release”. Additionally,  upon  reaching  500  EGT,  the  copilot  will  state  “Start  Fuel  OFF”  after  switch  is moved to the off position. 4.15.  Taxi and Parking Procedures.  Aircraft shall hover taxi no faster than 10KGS and IAW local procedures. Without wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by 25 feet; with wing walkers, by  10  feet.    When  taxi  clearance  is  uncertain,  use  a  wing  walker(s).  If  wing  walkers  are unavailable,  de-plane  a  crewmember(s)  to  maintain  obstruction  clearance.    Air  taxi  operations are permitted in open areas or on active/inactive runways at the discretion of ATC. 4.16.  Hover Power Checks.  Hover power checks will be conducted at a stabilized 4 foot hover into the wind. 4.16.1.  If  actual  power  required  to  hover  differs  by  more  than  +/-  4%  Q  from  computed power required, evaluate existing parameters (i.e. skid height vs. radar altimeter, actual OAT & PA, current gross weight, and winds) and re-compute TOLD. 4.16.2.  If  TOLD  is  recomputed  and  the  indicated  torque  is  still  greater  than  computed  +/- 4%, return the aircraft to maintenance. 4.16.3.  The  TH-1H  charts  are  for  a  calm  wind  day.  If  hovering  in  substantial  winds, indicated  torque  may  be  less  than  computed  torque  minus  4%  and  there  is  currently  not  a chart to adjust for this factor. The aircraft commander must make a determination, based on wind  speed,  mission  requirements,  and  experience,  whether  to  return  the  aircraft  to maintenance or continue the flight. If winds are not a contributing factor, return the aircraft to maintenance. 4.17.  Power  Assurance  Check  (PAC).  Log  the  PAC  results  on  the  TH-1H  Power  Assurance Log. If the aircraft fails the PAC, do NOT fly the aircraft. 4.18.  Takeoff  Call.  Within  the  Fort  Rucker  Training  Area,  the  initial  tower  call  will  include planned  departure  corridor.  Aircrew  will  ensure  tower  instructions  are  clearly  understood.  For night departures, advise tower if NVG aided or unaided. 4.18.1.  During peak times, make every effort to minimize time on the helipads or utilize the sod areas. Be prepared to take off early or delay to avoid problems with primary aircraft. 4.18.2.  For  Bravo  SOD  takeoffs  next  to  Cairns  AAF  runway  18/36,  aircrew  will  proceed over  the  runway  on  departure  unless  cleared  for  present  position  takeoff  by  Cairns  AAF Tower. 4.19.  Power-Available Check.  The PF will: AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   31  4.19.1.  Perform  a  power-available  check  on  all  contact/EP  and  mission  phase  sorties.  Instrument sorties do not require a power-available check. 4.19.2.  Perform the power-available check as near as possible to the same PA and outside air temperature  as  the  site.    For  training,  slowly  apply  collective  pitch  without  drooping  rotor speed (Nr) below 97 percent until reaching out of ground effect (OGE) + 5 percent or a limit defined  by  the  flight  manual.    An  actual  power  check  may  also  be  accomplished.    In  this case,  slowly  apply  collective  pitch  without  drooping  Nr  below  97  percent  until  computed power or a limit (as defined by the flight manual) is reached.  It is left to the discretion of the PIC  whether  to  pull  beyond  computed  power  available  in  order  to  determine  actual  engine power capabilities.  As a minimum, the engine must produce computed power available.  If the engine fails to produce the computed power available, terminate the flight. (T-2) 4.19.3.  Compare  maximum  power  available  with  power  required  for  the  intended  hover heights.  This  comparison  determines  the  power  margin  for  the  operation.  When  the  power margin  is  10  percent  or  less,  a  second  aircrew  member  will  re-compute  TOLD  to  confirm power requirements. (T-2) The smaller the power margin, the more hazardous the approach.  Extra caution must be used when operating in conditions that result in small power margins. 4.19.4.  Prior  to  landing,  ensure  that  sufficient  power  to  depart  the  planned  landing  site  is available. Factor in any weight that will be added at the site (e.g., survivors). 4.19.5.  If  sufficient  power  is  not  available  for  the  approach,  landing  and  departure,  lighten the helicopter, locate a more suitable landing site, or abort the mission. 4.20.  Crew  Changes.  Off-  and  on-load  for  crew  changes  are  authorized  while  rotors  are turning.    One  pilot  will  have  seat  belt  and  shoulder  harness  fastened  during  pilot  change.  The new crew will review aircraft forms, weight and balance, and TOLD prior to takeoff. 4.21.  Termination.  The following items must be accomplished prior to sortie completion: 4.21.1.  Aircrew will notify Blue MX 10 minutes out from sortie termination. This call will include:  aircraft status with MX Code status (below) 4.21.1.1.  A-1: No maintenance write-ups 4.21.1.2.  A-2: Minor write-ups. 4.21.1.3.  A-3:  Any  items  that  would  preclude  that  aircraft  from  further  flights  until maintenance is performed. 4.21.2.  Crews will make any applicable 781A entries. 4.21.2.1.  Crews  will  make  an  entry  anytime  the  aircraft  if  flown  in  a  salt  laden environment. 4.21.3.  Post Flight. Upon return, the aircraft commander will ensure the alpha status, sortie completion information and any deviations are recorded.   32  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 Chapter 5 CONTACT/EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 5.1.  General.  Contact  and  emergency  procedure  training  is  designed  to  develop  aircrew proficiency,  reaction  time,  planning,  and  judgment  in  preparation  for  actual  emergencies.  Simulated  emergencies  must  provide  realistic  training  without  unacceptably  increasing  risk.  Accomplish  simulated  emergency  maneuvers  according  to  the  flight  manual  and  this  chapter.  WARNING: Instructors must be alert and take prompt action to terminate simulated emergency maneuvers.    They  must  execute  corrective  action  at  the  first  indication  of  deteriorating  aircraft performance or serious student proficiency problems. 5.1.1.  The  instructor  will  emphasize  procedures  for  positive  identification  of  the  simulated emergency  condition  before  initiating  corrective  action.  (T-2)  System  failures  must  not  be unreasonably compounded. When initiating EPs, temper the “surprise” approach to allow for a  possible  wrong  reaction  which  could  jeopardize  safety.    Practice  such  emergencies  with sufficient airspeed and altitude to ensure a safe recovery. 5.1.2.  In high-density traffic areas, do not simulate emergencies that could require in-depth analysis, discussion, or detailed cockpit duties. 5.2.  Fort Rucker Stagefield Procedures. 5.2.1.  Communications.  On  initial  radio  contact  with  a  stagefield,  relay  the  following information:  Call  sign,  aircraft  type,  last  4  digits  of  tail  number,  number  of  personnel  on board  (POB),  position,  and  intentions/requests.  When  operating  at  a  stagefield  without  an operational control tower, use the stagefield’s North or East UHF frequency and monitor the air-to-air FM frequency. 5.2.2.  Pilots  will  confirm  the  landing  direction  with  stagefield  on  the  appropriate  tower frequency  prior  to  entering  the  traffic  pattern.  If  tower  is  not  open,  the  first  helicopter arriving at the stagefield will establish the traffic pattern and landing direction. 5.2.3.  When an emergency or precautionary landing is in progress, unless advised by ATC, only contact maneuvers may be performed. 5.2.4.  Crews will use appropriate A/A radio frequencies to call movements on the ramp, to include  movement  into  and  out  of  refuel,  and  when  extending  downwind  (e.g.  Hydraulics- Off slide approach). 5.3.  Power  Available  Check:  Accomplish the check once clear of the corridor or airspace by 1/2  NM.    May  be  done  in  the  downwind  if  the  crew  elects  to  remain  at  the  aerodrome  for training. 5.4.  Contact  Maneuver  Parameters.  Maneuver  parameters  (traffic  patterns,  takeoff  and landings,  hovering  maneuvers,  contact  maneuvers,  and  EP  training)  are  provided  in  this instruction to supplement the flight manual. These parameters are intended for all missions, but may  not  reflect  the  optimum  performance  required  for  some  operational  situations.  Maneuvers will be flown with an emphasis on precise altitude, airspeed, and aircraft control. 5.4.1.  Traffic Pattern. The pilot will: AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   33  5.4.1.1.  Enter the traffic pattern at a 45-degree angle to the center of the downwind leg (or as directed by the controlling agency) and accomplish the before-landing check. Fly the downwind leg at a 500-foot ASE and 90 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). 5.4.1.2.  During  the  turn  to  base,  descend  to  300  feet  ASE  and  slow  the  aircraft  to  70 knots ground speed (KGS). Pattern altitudes may be adjusted to comply with local ATC rules.  While  flying  traffic  patterns  at  stage  fields,  use  the  altitudes  listed  in  the  unit  in-flight guide.      NOTE: These altitudes will be used whenever possible if local conditions will permit, otherwise comply with appropriate local traffic patterns.  The before landing checklist should be accomplished prior to turning final. 5.4.1.3.  Use  caution  to  avoid  excessive  bank  angles,  excessive  descent  rates,  and  low airspeeds.  The  point  of  rollout  on  final  should  allow  a  controlled,  straight  approach without  the  need  for  aggravated  flares,  abrupt  control  movements,  or  large  collective inputs. 5.4.1.4.  Use proper power management to climb, level off, and descend, as appropriate. The entry altitude for all approaches will be 300 feet ASE unless otherwise specified in this instruction. 5.4.2.  Contact Maneuvers: 5.4.2.1.  Normal  Takeoff.  Initiate  from  the  ground  or  a  hover  using  4-foot  hover  power plus 10 percent. The maneuver is terminated at 70 KIAS.    NOTE: A normal takeoff is one in which the aircraft exposure time to the AVOID area of the height-velocity diagram is minimized. 5.4.2.2.  Marginal  Power  Takeoff.  A  marginal  power  takeoff  is  used  when  maximum power  available/power  margin  is  limited  due  to  environmental  factors,  gross  weight,  or other  external  factors.  Initiate  from  the  ground  or  hover  using  4  foot  hover  power.  Simulate  a  50-foot  obstacle.    The  maneuver  is  terminated  when  clear  of  the  simulated obstacle and above 50 KIAS. 5.4.2.3.  Maximum Performance Takeoff. A maximum performance takeoff is used when an obstacle restricts use of a normal takeoff; specifically requiring a near vertical takeoff (altitude over airspeed) in order to avoid the obstacle. Initiate from the ground or 4-foot hover using a simulated maximum power available of 4-foot hover power plus 10-15% or as  specified  by  the  IP/EP.    Simulate  a  100-foot  obstacle.    The  maneuver  is  terminated when clear of the simulated obstacle and above 70 KIAS. 5.4.2.4.  Slide  Takeoff.  Initiate  from  the  ground  using  a  simulated  maximum  power available of 4-foot hover power minus 5% or as specified by the IP/EP.  Once sufficient altitude and  airspeed is  attained to  clear any  obstacles, smoothly  accelerate to  50  KIAS and terminate the maneuver. 5.4.2.5.  Normal  Approach.  Use  an  8  degree  angle  for  a  normal  approach  (Historically referred to as a 30 degree apparent angle). Initiate the approach from 300 feet ASE and an  approximate  50  knots  ground  speed  (KGS).  The  approach  may  be  completed  to  a touchdown or a 4-foot hover. 5.4.2.6.  Shallow  Approach.  Use  a  3  degree  angle  for  a  shallow  approach  (Historically referred to as a 10 degree apparent angle). Initiate the approach from 300 feet ASE and   34  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 an approximate 70 KGS. The approach may be completed to a touchdown, 4-foot hover, or a slide over the intended landing spot. 5.4.2.7.  Steep Approach. Initiate the approach at 300 feet ASE, an approximate 30 KGS, and  a  13  degree  angle  (Historically  referred  to  as  a  45  degree  apparent  angle).  The approach  may  be  completed  to  a  touchdown  or  a  4-foot  hover.  On  final  approach, monitor  the  following  three  parameters:  (1)  proper  rate  of  closure,  (2)  rate  of  descent under control, and (3) power smoothly increasing but below hover power. 5.4.2.8.  Turning  Approach.  A  turning  approach  can  be  initiated  from  any  position  in relation  to  the intended landing  area.  For training, normally  initiate a 90-degree turning approach  from  base  altitude  and  airspeed  and  a  180-degree  or  more  turning  approach from downwind altitude and airspeed. 5.5.  Emergency Procedure Training Requirements: 5.5.1.  Accomplish Emergency Procedure (EP) training only under daytime VMC conditions (after sunrise but before official sunset), with no passengers, and only at local stagefields or airfields  contained  in  the  IFG.  Student  EP  training  will  only  be  accomplished  for  training, currency, or evaluation flights. An IP must always be at a set of controls. (T-2) 5.5.2.  Use  local  auxiliary  fields  and  airfields  for  EP  and  normal  procedure  maneuvers  that require  a  slide  landing.    If  accurate  wind  information  cannot  be  obtained  through  tower services, a wind detection device, readily discernible to the pilot flying (PF), is required. 5.5.3.  Ensure  the  IFG  depicts  the  auxiliary  field,  highlighting  all  normal  and  unusual conditions,  such  as  size,  landing  directions,  and  location  of  any  known  obstructions  (wind socks, tires, etc.). (T-2) 5.5.4.  Crash and fire rescue must be available to conduct EP training. (T-2) 5.5.5.  EP  training  requires  aligning  the  aircraft  landing  direction  within  45  degrees  of  the wind  direction  when  winds  exceed  15  knots  (including  peak  gusts).    At  or  below  15  knots (including peak  gusts), align the aircraft landing  direction to  within 90 degrees  of the  wind direction. 5.5.6.  Planned  touchdown  in  the  last  1/3  of  the  lane  at  stagefields  (or  the  last  500  ft  at airfields without 1/3 lane markers) is prohibited when performing any shallow approaches to run-on landings (including simulated EP’s) and autorotations. You may utilize the last 1/3 of the lane at stagefields (or last 500 ft at airfields without 1/3 lane markers) when performing power recovery autorotations, hovering autorotations and SEFs at a hover. 5.5.7.  For  hovering  autorotations,  align  the  aircraft  heading  within  15  degrees  of  current wind  heading.  Wind  reporting  capability  must  be  available  at  the  location  where  EPs  are conducted. 5.6.  Emergency Maneuver Parameters: 5.6.1.  Hydraulics-Off Approach (Simulated Hydraulic System Malfunction): 5.6.1.1.  Configuration  changes  shall  be  initiated  prior  to  running  checklists  (e.g.  enter hydraulics off prior to accomplishing the before landing checklist). AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   35  5.6.1.2.  Initiate at a minimum of 300-feet AGL and 70 KIAS while the aircraft is straight and level. (T-2) 5.6.1.3.  PNF will back-up the PF on the cyclic and identifies the hydraulic control switch (labeled HYD CONT) 5.6.1.4.  The PNF moves this switch to the off position: 5.6.1.4.1.  If  a  Flight  Control  Servo  Hardover  is  encountered,  the  PNF  will  execute the Boldface for this EP. 5.6.1.5.  If the PF has normal hydraulic off control forces, the PNF can remove their hand from the cyclic and reset the Master Caution annunciator. 5.6.1.6.  For SUPT-H students, the Hydraulics off maneuver will be accomplished using a slide  landing  above  ETL  or  planned  go  around  at  50’  AGL.          NOTE:  IPs  should  be familiar with the method of utilizing a steep approach to an approximate 10kt slide. 5.6.2.  SEF at Altitude. Minimum entry parameters are 700 feet AGL and no slower than 60 KIAS.  The  IP  will  announce,  “SIMULATED  ENGINE  FAILUE”,  and  confirm  the  proper execution of boldface.      NOTE: If aligned for a runway or taxiway with clearance to land, this maneuver may be initiated using straight ahead autorotation parameters.       NOTE: IP’s are encouraged to  initiate SEF’s at  or above 1500 MSL when possible to  accommodate for slow  student  reaction  time  and  to  allow  for  additional  training  opportunities  (turns  into  the wind, proper verbalization of critical items without rushing, etc.).        WARNING: SEFs at altitude are prohibited in the upwind or crosswind. 5.6.2.1.  Upon detecting engine failure, the PF will lower the collective to maintain rotor rpm  (Nr)  in  limits  while  adjusting  the  pedals  to  put  the  aircraft  in  trim.  He  or  she  will verbally call out the boldface outlined in the aircraft checklist.  Once the autorotation is entered,  verbally  confirm  Ng  and  all  of  the  engine  gauges  are  stabilized.  The  PF  will select  a  suitable  landing  area,  turn,  adjust  airspeed  as  necessary,  and  maneuver  the aircraft for a safe landing to the intended landing area. He or she will maintain airspeed at or above 60 KIAS throughout the descent.      NOTE: Do not turn into or toward a stage field traffic pattern during an SEF. If a turn is required, turn away from the traffic pattern. 5.6.2.2.  Prior to reaching 400 feet AGL with the aircraft in a safe autorotative profile, the IP will state one of three commands: (1) power recovery, (2) terminate with power, or (3) touch down. The PF will perform the following actions during these recoveries: 5.6.2.3.  SEF  Power  Recovery.  Upon  receiving  the  command  “POWER  RECOVERY,” the  PF  will  immediately  establish  normal  operating  rpm  by  smoothly  adjusting  the throttle to the fully open position. After normal operating rpm has been regained, the PF will  increase  the  collective  to  establish  a  normal  climb  prior  to  reaching  200  feet  AGL and climb out with no less than 60 KIAS.       CAUTION: Use caution when increasing the throttle to avoid overspeeding the rotor. 5.6.2.4.  Terminate  with  Power.  If  aligned  for  a  runway  or  taxiway,  with  clearance  to land,  the  IP  may  give  the  command  to  “TERMINATE  WITH  POWER.”  The  PF  will continue  the  autorotative  descent  and  follow  the  procedures  for  a  straight-ahead autorotation (power recovery).   36  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 5.6.2.5.  Touch Down. If aligned for a runway or taxiway with clearance to land, the IP may  give  the  command  to  “TOUCH  DOWN.”  The  PF  will  continue  the  autorotative descent and follow the procedures for a straight-ahead autorotation. 5.6.3.  SEF in a Hover. Initiate a simulated engine failure (SEF) from a 4-foot hover with the call  “SEF”  or  “HOVERING  AUTO”  by  the  PNF  while  smoothly  rolling  the  throttle  to  the idle position. 5.6.4.  Practice Autorotations: 5.6.4.1.  General Considerations: 5.6.4.1.1.  Accomplish autorotations to a runway or taxiway. 5.6.4.1.2.  For  autorotations,  entry  altitude  is  800  feet  ASE  minimum  for  a  180 degree,  500  feet  ASE  minimum  for  straight  ahead,  50  feet  AHO  but  no  lower  than 100 feet ASE at entry point for low level, and 4 feet for hovering. (T-2) 5.6.4.1.3.  The initial  autorotation  for training, currency, or  evaluations is  a straight-ahead  autorotation  accomplished  by  the  IP  or  IP  candidate  to  evaluate  aircraft performance.       WARNING: Avoid low airspeed and/or high vertical descent prior to the flare during practice autorotations because engine power or rotor inertia may not be sufficient to recover under these conditions. Avoid chasing the airspeed with rapid, erratic changes of aircraft attitude. These changes make airspeed and rotor parameters difficult  to  maintain.  Aircraft  trim  is  critical  to  successful  completion  of  the maneuver. If at any time the safe completion of the practice autorotation is in doubt, initiate  an  immediate  power  recovery  or  a  go-around  as  the  situation  dictates.       WARNING:  Because  of  the  risk  associated  with  practice  autorotations,  carefully consider wind, density altitude, aircraft gross weight, and individual pilot proficiency prior  to  performing  this  maneuver.  Fly  each  autorotation  as  if  a  landing  may  be required. That way, if a malfunction occurs, the aircraft is in position to execute a safe landing.            WARNING:  IPs  must  terminate  the  maneuver  and  initiate  a  power recovery at the first indication of abnormally high or low rotor revolutions per minute (rpm), excessive sink rate, low airspeed, or ineffective flare. (T-0) 5.6.4.1.4.  By 150-feet ASE, the aircraft must be wings level, have a minimum of 70 KIAS, rotor RPM within limits, and be aligned for landing/recovery heading.  If any of these requirements are not met, initiate a power recovery immediately.  The wings level requirement does not prohibit minor heading corrections on final. 5.6.4.1.5.  The  aircraft  should  be  established  in  the  flare  between  100  and  75  feet AGL with a minimum of 70 KIAS. 5.6.4.1.6.  At  approximately  15  feet  AGL,  apply  sufficient  collective  to  control  the rate  of  descent  and  groundspeed.  Adjust  the  cyclic  to  attain  a  landing  attitude  just before  touchdown,  and  apply  the  collective  as  necessary  to  cushion  the  landing between  approximately  5-25  knots  groundspeed,  with  no  lateral  drift.  After touchdown, maintain ground track alignment with the pedals. 5.6.4.1.6.1.  Straight-ahead or 180-degree autorotations may be accomplished to a power  recovery  or  touchdown,  but  should  be  briefed  during  the  Before  Landing Checklist. AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   37  5.6.4.1.7.  When practicing turning autorotations  in excess of 180 degrees, terminate with power recovery at or above 250 feet AGL. (T-2) 5.6.4.2.  Straight Ahead Autorotation. 5.6.4.2.1.  Minimum  altitude  will  be  500’  ASE  at  approximately  90  KIAS  but  no slower than 80 KIAS and no faster than 100 KIAS. 5.6.4.3.  Low Level Autorotation. 5.6.4.3.1.  Low-level checklist is not required for this maneuver. 5.6.4.3.2.  PF  can  begin  descent  to  50’  AHO  abeam  the  intended  entry  point  while maintaining visual with the intended touchdown point. 5.6.4.3.3.  Minimum entry airspeed is 70 KIAS but no faster than 100KIAS and rotor RPM within limits 5.6.4.3.4.  Minimum entry altitude is 50’ AHO but no lower than 100’ASE. 5.6.4.3.5.  Maximum  offset  angle  should  not  exceed  30-degrees  from  the  intended landing area. 5.6.4.3.6.  Low-level autorotations are only practiced to intended touchdowns. 5.6.4.4.  180-Degree Autorotation. 5.6.4.4.1.  Minimum  altitude  and  airspeed  for  entry  will  be  800’  ASE  and approximately 90 KIAS but no slower than 80 KIAS and no faster than 100 KIAS. 5.6.4.5.  Hovering Autorotation. 5.6.4.5.1.  Initiate  a  Hovering  Autorotation  from  a  4’  hover  with the  call “HOVERING  AUTO”  by  the  PF  while  smoothly  rolling  the  throttle  to  the  idle position. (T-2) 5.6.5.  Simulated Fixed Pedal Approach (Anti-Torque). 5.6.5.1.  Minimum altitude and airspeed are 70 KIAS and 300-feet AGL. 5.6.5.2.  Maximum  out  of  trim  condition  (right  or  left)  is  10  degree  not  to  exceed  20 degree off runway heading, including crab already applied 5.6.5.3.  Entry:  While still on downwind, the PF removes the mechanical slack from the throttle  while  maintaining  100%  Nf/Nr  and  reviews  or  briefs  his/her  intentions  for  the simulated  condition.    On  base  leg,  PF  will  descend  to  the  appropriate  altitude  and airspeed.  On final with the aircraft at the proper altitude, airspeed, power applied, and in trim, the PNF will state “THIS IS SIMULATED” and input a nose-right or –left out-of-trim condition 5.6.5.4.  Approach:  During  right  pedal  settings  the  approach  will  be  to  a  slide  landing.  Left  pedal  settings  may  be  completed  to  a  slide  landing  or  hover  depending  on environmental and out-of-trim conditions               WARNING: At no point will the PF reduce Nr below 91%.              NOTE: In case of an in-flight emergency that results in fixed  tail  rotor  pitch  settings,  use  the  procedures  outlined  in  the  flight  manual.              NOTE:  After  touchdown,  the  aircraft  heading  may  not  be  controllable  with  the  throttle   38  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 and collective.  If this happens, position the cyclic to follow the turn until the aircraft has come to a complete stop. 5.6.6.  Emergency Governor Operations. 5.6.6.1.  Entry.  Nose must be aligned within 20 deg of the wind 5.6.6.1.1.  Enter from the ground with the collective full down and rpm stabilized at 100 percent Nf. 5.6.6.1.2.  Retard the throttle to engine idle. 5.6.6.1.3.  After noting a decrease in engine rpm, request pilot not flying (PNF) move the  GOV  switch  to  EMER  position.  Then  smoothly  adjust  the  throttle  to  97-100 percent.  When  operating  below  97  percent  Nf,  the  MFD  will  display  Nf  in  the  red; however, there is no harm done to the aircraft or the engine. 5.6.6.1.4.  It is permissible to adjust the bleed band operating range by decreasing the INCR/DECR switch if bleed band cycling interferes with the pilot’s ability to control Nf.            CAUTION: Make smooth throttle and collective adjustments to prevent engine overspeed, overtemperature,  compressor stall,  or failure. Closely  monitor the Ng, Nf, and exhaust gas temperature. 5.6.6.2.  Hover.  Bring  the  aircraft  to  a  stabilized  4’  hover  by  smoothly  increasing  the collective and adjusting  the throttle to maintain Nf at  97-100 percent.   Apply the cyclic and pedals as necessary to remain stationary and to maintain constant heading.  Clear the aircraft and perform a left- and a right-hovering turn. 5.6.6.3.  Landing. Land the aircraft by smoothly reducing the collective and adjusting the throttle to maintain Nf at 97-100 percent. After landing, reduce the throttle to engine idle. After noting a decrease in engine rpm, have the PNF move the GOV switch to the AUTO position. Slowly increase the throttle to the full-open position and adjust the rpm to 100 percent Nf. Ensure the fuel control is operating properly.              NOTE: In case of an actual in-flight emergency that requires emergency governor operations, the aircrew will use the procedures outlined in the flight manual. 5.7.  TH-1  Maneuver  Restrictions.  Emergency governor operations will only be conducted in the  TH-1H  aircraft  for  instructor  training  and  proficiency  and  for  FCF  pilots.  Student  training will not include Emergency Governor Operations. 5.8.  Circuit  Breakers.  Crewmembers  will  not  pull  engine,  transmission,  hydraulic,  or  fuel system circuit breakers in flight to simulate malfunctions. AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   39  Chapter 6 INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES 6.1.  Instrument  Cockpit  Check.  Complete  an  instrument  cockpit  check  before  takeoff  if expecting IMC during flight.  See dual systems in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1.  For the purposes of  the  instrument  cockpit  check/navigation  equipment  check,  an  operable  very  high  frequency omni-directional  range  station  (VOR),  tactical  air  navigation  (TACAN),  distance  measuring equipment  (DME)  or  an  IFR-certified  global  positioning  system  (GPS)  with  available  RAIM may be used in place of a second like system. (T-2) 6.2.  Advisory Calls:  Mandatory altitude calls for the pilot not flying (PNF) during IFR include: 6.2.1.  Climbout  or  Descent.  Calls  will  be  at  500  and  100  feet  below  or  above  assigned altitude and 500 and 100 feet below or above initial approach fix altitude or holding altitude (T-2). 6.2.2.  Nonprecision Approaches. Call “one hundred feet above minimums,” “minimums” at minimum descent altitude (MDA), and “runway in sight.”  Do not call “runway in sight” too soon  if  vision  is  obstructed  by  fog,  haze,  low  stratus  clouds,  etc.  Call  “go-around”  at  the missed approach point if the runway environment is not in sight. (T-2) 6.2.3.  Precision  Approaches.  Call  “one  hundred  feet  above”  when  one  hundred  feet  above decision altitude (DA).   Then, if the runway environment  is  in  sight  and the aircraft is  in  a position  for  a  normal  landing,  call  “land”  at  decision  height.    Otherwise,  call  “go-around.” (T-2) 6.2.4.  The  PNF  will  announce  heading  deviations  of  10  degrees,  airspeed  deviations  of  10 knots, and altitude deviations exceeding 100 feet.  Any crewmember who sees a deviation of 100 feet in altitude or a potential terrain or obstruction problem will immediately notify the pilot flying. Deviations from prescribed procedures for the approach being flown will also be announced. (T-2) 6.3.  Unusual  Attitude  Training.  Accomplish  unusual  attitude  training  only  under  daytime VMC  conditions,  with  no passengers.                    NOTE: This  restriction does not  apply when conducting unusual attitude training in the simulator. 6.3.1.  Entry  must  be  at  or  above  1,000  feet  AGL.    Simulated  unusual  attitudes  will  not exceed 30 degrees of bank; a 20-degree, nose-high attitude; or a 10-degree, nose-low attitude. (T-2) 6.4.  Instrument Approaches at Enterprise (KEDN) Airport.  ATC will use the EDN VOR 5 missed approach holding pattern as a published holding pattern. This is a non-standard holding pattern,  but  the  holding  pattern  is  used  to  keep  traffic  away  from  Cairns  AAF  airspace.  When established in VOR 5 EDN holding pattern and subsequently cleared the approach, there are two options. 6.4.1.  Request the full procedure from ATC. Before commencing the approach, the PF must return to the IAF. Ensure it is clarified with ATC that once holding is complete the intent is to  complete  full  procedure.  Upon  reaching  the  VOR  and  cleared  the  approach,  turn  to  the maneuvering  side  and  commence  the  approach  as  depicted.  Upon  passing  the  VOR  and   40  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 established  on  the  approach  you  are  cleared  to  descend  unless  told  otherwise  by  ATC.  If anywhere  other than the  IAF,  do  not intercept  the course  and fly the barb.  IAW 11-217V1 when  established  in  holding  and  subsequently  cleared  for  the  approach  and  the  holding course  and  PT  course  are  the  same  do  not  execute  a  procedure  turn.  Therefore,  if  the  full procedure is desired, finish the holding pattern and commence the approach at the IAF. 6.4.2.  Request radar vectors to final.           NOTE: Normally there would be the option to complete  the  1  minute  outbound  and  then  once  established  on  the  course  inbound  fly  the approach. This is not an option here due to an excessive sink rate and the disorientation that could  result  while  losing  1220  feet  in  1  minute.  It  is  not  allowed  to  extend  your  holding pattern out past one minute to complete the approach. AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   41  Chapter 7 UNPREPARED LANDING SITE PROCEDURES 7.1.  Crew Coordination. 7.1.1.  Obstacle  Clearance.  Crewmembers  will  announce  the  clock  position,  relative  to  the nose  of  the  aircraft,  and  the  estimated  distance  of  any  obstacle  whenever  horizontal  rotor clearance is 25 feet or less.  Example: “tree, nine o’clock, 20 feet.” (T-2) 7.1.2.  Voice  Procedures.  The  PF  informs  the  crew  when  on  final  approach  heading  by stating “ON FINAL” and when beginning the approach by stating “ON APPROACH.” Upon commencing the approach, the crew, starting with the PNF then scanners, as applicable, uses the triangle method for clearing the aircraft along the approach path. (T-2) 7.1.2.1.  PNF triangle calls will be in 100-foot increments when above 300 feet ASE, and 50-foot  increments  when  below  300  feet  ASE.    The  advisory  will  include  altitude, airspeed/groundspeed,  and,  at  the  PF’s  discretion,  descent  and  power  applied,  in  that order.    Example:  “250  feet,  40  knots  (or  knots  ground),  sink  500,  torque  30  percent.”  After each advisory call, the scanners will provide terrain or hazard clearance inputs. 7.1.2.2.  With  qualified  scanners  on  board,  the  PNF  will  normally  transfer  calls  at  50-100ft by stating “DOOR” after which the scanners will become primary. The frequency of  advisory  calls  should  indicate  the  speed  of  the  helicopter  toward  the  landing  area, survivor, or closure rate. A closure rate is not given in a preset distance of feet, yards, or meters.  An  example  would  be  “SURVIVOR  AT  TWELVE  FOR  ONE  HUNDRED, SEVENTY-FIVE,  FIFTY,  FORTY,  ETC.”  When  close  to  the  intended  point  of landing/hover,  the  primary  scanner  should  count  down  as  follows:  “FIVE,  FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE, STOP FORWARD, STOP DOWN.” The faster the countdown, the more rapid the closure. If the closure rate is too fast for the conditions, do not hesitate to call  “GO-AROUND.”  Standardized  words  for  directions  and  motion  may  be  added  to better  describe  necessary  actions,  e.g.,  “SLOW  FORWARD,  TURN  RIGHT,  STOP BACK.” See Table 7.1, Standard Terminology For Motion and Direction.            NOTE: When  applicable,  PF  should  acknowledge  direction  calls  (eg.  FE/scanner  calls:  “STOP LEFT” PF responds: “STOPPING LEFT”) Table 7.1.  Standard Terminology for Motion and Direction. 7.2.  Power Available Check.  The PF will:    42  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 7.2.1.  Perform a power available check prior to the low reconnaissance.  Perform this check en route or at the site. Aircrew may elect to perform another power check once at the site for further demonstration/training accomplishment. 7.3.  Power Requirements.  Operational power requirements are according to the flight manual. 7.3.1.  For training, hover power is required to operate at all landing sites. Additionally, when landing in areas with a restricted escape route minimum power is  OGE + 5 percent.  When operating at a pinnacle the minimum power is OGE. (T-2) 7.3.2.  Consider that power available at the site may differ from power available in flight if temperature or PA differs. Re-accomplish the power check if conditions change from worst case which will result in a decrease in power available. 7.4.  Site  Selection  for  Training.  Refer  to  AFI  13-217,  Drop  Zone  and  Landing  Zone Operations, for helicopter landing zone dimension and survey requirements. 7.4.1.  Aircrew  must  ensure  to  check  the  appropriate  AF  4303  and  MITA/QITA  to  ensure legal  operation  at  each  site  to  include  noise  complaints,  traffic  restrictions,  and  maximum aircraft restrictions. 7.5.  Communication Requirements.  Aircrews will make the first RT call no later than 2 NM from the RT and the second RT call no later than 1/2 NM from the RT. The first call will consist of  RT  number  traffic,  callsign,  location,  intentions,  request  landing  direction  and  traffic advisories, RT number (eg. “RT 366 traffic, Blue 06 is 2 NM to the South, inbound for multiple high orbits request  traffic advisories and landing direction, RT 366”). Appropriate take-off  and base  turn  calls  must  be  made  stating  RT  number  traffic,  callsign,  take-off/landing  direction, closed pattern, intentions, etc (eg. “RT 366, Blue 06 is taking off heading 030, remaining right closed, RT 366”).  Traffic already in the RT will establish the pattern and inbound aircraft will give way until radio contact is made.  If unable to contact aircraft already in the RT, attempt to contact them on an internal frequency. 7.6.  High  Reconnaissance.  Fly  the  high  reconnaissance  at  300’  ASE,  but  no  less  than  100’ AHO.  Additionally the high reconnaissance will be flown at a minimum of 50 KIAS to reduce exposure within the avoid region of the height velocity diagram. (T-2) 7.6.1.  On  the  high  reconnaissance  the  crew  must  evaluate  the  following  items  before landing: 7.6.1.1.  Winds, turbulence, and null areas 7.6.1.2.  Elevation of the site 7.6.1.3.  Temperature and pressure altitude 7.6.1.4.  Power available, required, and margin 7.6.1.5.  Approach/departure, obstacles, and go/no-go point 7.6.1.6.  Suitability of the site 7.6.1.7.  Touchdown point 7.6.1.8.  Escape route AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   43  7.7.  Low  Reconnaissance.  During  the  low  reconnaissance,  the  pilot  confirms  the  touchdown point  and  flies  their  final  approach  routing.    Minimum  altitude  is  50-feet  AHO  and  airspeed should be approximately 50 KIAS but in no case slower than effective translational lift (ETL). At the  pilot’s  discretion,  the  low  reconnaissance  may  be  performed  on  final  approach  if  out-of-ground-effect (OGE) hover power is available. Minimum power to execute a low reconnaissance on final is OGE+5% for student training. (T-2)   44  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 Chapter 8 ALTERNATE LOADING/INSERTION/EXTRACTION 8.1.  Purpose.  This for  Alternate Loading/Insertion/Extraction (AIE).  Alternate insertion/extraction is  the insertion or  extraction of any personnel by means other than landing the aircraft. procedures establishes chapter guidelines and 8.2.  General.  Current  Air  Force  methods  of  helicopter  insertion  and  extraction  include rappelling,  fast  roping,  rope  ladder,  and  hoist.  These  methods  are  referred  to  collectively  as AIEs. These methods and procedures apply to both day and NVG operations. 8.3.  Alternate  Loading  Procedures.  All  personnel  flying  in  rotary-wing  aircraft  must  be restrained by the safest  means possible for the type of mission flown. Standard troop seats  and seatbelts should be used to the maximum extent possible. (T-1) 8.3.1.  Concept  of  Operation.  For  alternate  loading  methods,  all  seats  and  equipment  not required for the mission may be removed. The cabin floor itself will be defined as the seat. Either  tie-down  straps,  seat  belts,  or  personal  restraint  lanyards  (PRL)  will  restrain  the occupants. The purpose of PRLs is to expedite infiltration and exfiltration, not to replace the use  of  seat  belts.  To  the  maximum  extent  possible,  limit  the  use  of  the  PRL  to  the terminal/objective  area.  Crewmembers  should  have  a  seat  with  seat  belts  available.  All restraints  may  be  removed  upon  landing  in  the  HLZ  or  upon  direction  of  the  AC.  These procedures may only be  used during tactical/training/contingency operations when standard seating is inappropriate.              WARNING: Be aware of the possibility of reduced main rotor and/or tail rotor blade ground clearance and avoid the upslope side and tail rotor side of the helicopter when loading or off-loading. 8.3.2.  Alternate  Loading  of  Combat-Equipped  Personnel.  Mission  requirements  and helicopter gross weight will dictate the total number of combat-equipped troops to be loaded. Mission equipment may be installed as required in accordance with appropriate directives. 8.4.  Operational  Authority  and  Responsibilities.  The  individuals  within  this  chain  of command are the AC, the FE, and the rope master (RM), if required. USAF “customers” do not use RMs,  but  will designate a member as the Team  Lead  (TL). Sister service “customers” that require an RM will designate a team member as the RM. When an RM is not required, the TL will  perform  the  RM  duties  as  described  below.  If  only  one  roper  is  involved  in  the  AIE operation, he/she will be considered the TL. 8.4.1.  AC Responsibilities.  In all situations, the AC has full responsibility  for the safety of the  crew  and  passengers,  and  the  orderly  conduct  of  all  aspects  of  the  flight.  The  AC exercises final authority to cease or terminate operations. 8.4.2.  Pilot Flying Responsibilities. The PF is responsible for communicating with the crew and maintaining a stable hover. 8.4.3.  Pilot  Not  Flying  Responsibilities.  The  PNF  is  responsible  for  monitoring  torque, aircraft  instruments  and  performance,  scanning,  and  ensuring  the  pilot  maintains  a  stable hover. AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   45  8.4.4.  Safetyman. FEs trained and qualified in the AIE event being performed will act as the safetyman.  FEs  are  responsible  for  the  safe  conduct  of  all  passengers  and  proper configuration of the aircraft for rope operations. The safetyman will be in position to monitor all  exit  activities,  relay  communications,  monitor  the  deployed  ropes  to  ensure  ground contact  is  maintained,  and  recover  or  release  the  ropes  upon  completion  of  the insertion/extraction. 8.4.5.  RM/TL. During helicopter operations, the RM/TL is subordinate in authority to the FE and  the  AC.  The  RM/TL  is  responsible  for  the  safety,  conduct,  and  performance  of  rope personnel. The RM/TL is responsible for inspecting and rigging the aircraft and hooking up and deploying ropers. Only one RM/TL may control an evolution, but any other RM/TL or the FE may assist the primary RM/TL in their duties. 8.4.6.  Communication  Over  ICS.  Positive  communication  over  Internal  Communication System  (ICS)  must  be  maintained  throughout  any  training  insertion/extraction  evolution between all aircrew members including the RM/TL. During operational missions, if there is a loss of communication or ICS failure, alternate insertion/extraction operations may continue as mission requirements dictate. Live personnel deployment for training will cease if both the RM/TL and FE loses ICS capability. Comm-out procedures may be used for training with no live deployments. 8.5.  Mission  Briefs.  Prior  to  deployment,  the  AC  will  ensure  the  AIE  briefing  in  11-2TH-1HVol 3, CL-1, is completed for the applicable device to be used. The RM/TL must conduct an operation  brief  for  all  insertion/extraction  personnel  and  a  face-to-face  mission  brief  for  all aircrew  personnel  participating  in  AIE  operations.  The  brief  should  include  a  discussion  of emergency procedures, comm out hand signals, night signals (if applicable), and number of and how many iterations and team members in each iteration. 8.6.  Environmental  Factors.  Altitude,  temperature,  wind,  and  humidity  affect  aircraft performance  and  the  pilot’s  ability  to  safely  maintain  his  position  over  the  target  spot.  Care should be taken to select a drop/pickup zone that is relatively free of dust, snow, or other objects that could obscure the pilot’s vision. 8.6.1.  Visibility. Night  or limited visibility operations further affect  the RM/TL’s ability to maintain control of personnel during the evolution. During NVG training, the RM/TL should use chemlights to determine rope and personnel positions. Using a finger light or a chemlight provides  a  reference  for  the  RM/TL  to  hook  up  each  team  member.  A  chemlight  on  each individual’s  left  arm  and  one  on  their  right  leg  provides  the  rope  master  and/or  belayer  a reference of the person’s position during the evolution. Chemlights can also assist with hand-and-arm signals during night operations. It is imperative that the FE be able to see the rope in contact with the ground at all times after it is deployed. 8.7.  Inner  Aircraft  Safety.  When  possible,  improvise  handholds  to  assist  in  moving  from  a seated position to the device stations. Cargo straps, ropes, or webbing can be secured overhead to provide a secure handhold during movement 8.7.1.  Mishap Procedures. If a mishap occurs, all training will cease and crewmembers will follow  briefed  safety  procedures.  Do  not  disturb  the  device  rigging  if  it  was  a  factor  in  the mishap,  unless  it  interferes  with  the  evacuation  of  the  injured  personnel  or  could  cause  an unsafe situation landing the aircraft.   46  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 8.8.  Flight Dynamics. 8.8.1.  Hover  Height.  Numerous  factors  determine  suitable  hover  heights  and,  therefore, preclude establishment of a prescribed altitude for helicopter operations. 8.8.1.1.  A rope hanging beneath the helicopter can become agitated by rotor downwash and  could  cause  a  potentially  dangerous  situation.  Adjust  hover  as  necessary;  a  slightly higher hover reduces the effect of rotor downwash on the ground and device. 8.8.1.2.  While  operating  in  wooded  or  mountainous  areas,  hover  height  is  restricted  to the  lowest  possible  height  commensurate  with  rope  length,  obstacle  clearance,  visual cues, soil stability, rotor downwash, and helicopter performance. 8.8.2.  Static Discharge. Static electricity is generated by the rotor and is discharged from the aircraft  by  contact  with  the  ground.  Ropes  are  non-conductive  and  do  not  allow  static electricity  to  be  discharged  through  them.  The  deployed  personnel  may  experience  a  slight shock  upon  touching  the  ground;  this  shock  should  not  interfere  with  normal  operations. Ropes  may  become  conductive  if  wet.  Conductivity  lessens  as  the  length  of  the  rope increases.                 NOTE: A static discharge may be seen up to 16 inches from a device. 8.8.3.  Aircraft  Emergencies.  Aircraft  emergencies  during  live  AIE  operations  are  very complex  and  require  excellent  crew  coordination  and  skill.  Actions  to  be  taken  by  each crewmember should an aircraft emergency occur during AIE operation should be thoroughly briefed.  Discussion  should  include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  cut/release  procedures  of  AIE equipment,  actions to  be taken by personnel  on  AIE equipment,  and actions to  be taken by crewmembers to assist personnel on AIE equipment. 8.9.  Equipment. 8.9.1.  Aircraft Surfaces. Cabin floor surfaces must be clean and free of oil and solvents. 8.9.2.  Protective  Equipment.  All  personnel  accomplishing  rope  operations  are  required  to wear the following protective clothing/equipment: 8.9.2.1.  Any uniform that fully covers the team’s arms and legs which will help to avoid cuts, abrasions and skin irritations. 8.9.2.2.  Glove types will be determined by RM/TL. 8.9.2.3.  A  Kevlar  helmet,  PROTEC-type  helmet,  or  flight  helmet  will  be  worn  during rope operations. 8.9.2.4.  Approved hearing protection, i.e., ear plugs, muff-type ear defenders, or a flight helmet. 8.9.2.5.  Each  participant  must  wear  approved  protective  eyewear,  prescription eyeglasses,  or  an  aircrew  flight  helmet  visor.  Standard  eyeglasses  alone  will  not  be sufficient eye protection during any AIE operation. 8.9.2.6.  Each  participant  must  wear  an  approved  personal  flotation  device  when conducting  rope  operations  over  water  or  when  the  aircraft’s  route  to  the  drop/pickup zone passes over water and is not within autorotational distance of land. 8.9.2.7.  With  the  cargo  door(s)  open,  all  personnel  accomplishing  AIE  operations  will wear a restraint device. AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   47  8.10.  Emergency  Procedures.  The nature and severity of the emergency dictate the degree of the response to the emergency. Declarative or directive statements indicate actions taken by the FE and RM/TL and should be briefed during mission briefings. 8.10.1.  Commands/Signals. Hand/arm signals provide a comm-out means of communication between aircrew and ropers/hoist riders and ground personnel. Hand signals should be made as  large  as  possible  when  signaling  outside  the  aircraft.  See  Table  8.1  Emergency Commands and Hand-and-Arm Signals. Table 8.1.  Emergency Commands and Hand-and-Arm Signals. VOICE HAND SIGNAL DESCRIPTION ABORT/CEASE OPERATIONS Hand moving back and forth in front of the neck in a slashing motion. Initiated by any crewmember to include the RM/TL or ground personnel. Used to cease further operations until an unsafe situation is corrected. AIRCRAFT EMERGENCY Hand with fingers extended and palm down is raised and lowered above the head. Initiated by any crewmember and indicates an aircraft emergency presently exists. CRASH LANDING  Both hands, each with fingers extended and palms down, raised and lowered above the head in unison. DEPLOY ROPE LADDER Fists shoulder width apart, moved in a climbing motion. ENTANGLEMENT  Forearms raised laterally to the front at shoulder height, clasping hands with palms facing inward and fingers interlocking.

Initiated by any crewmember to include the RM/TL. Directs ropers remaining in the aircraft to return to their seats and don their restraint device. 8.11.  Rope Ladder Procedures. 8.11.1.  General.  The  rope  ladder  can  be  used  for  both  air-to-ground  deployment  and extraction of personnel (referred to hereafter as a climber) from water or land recovery zones. The major drawback to using the rope ladder is its limited capability due to the ladder length, size, and weight. 8.11.2.  Components. 8.11.2.1.  Rope Ladder. The rope ladder is made of nylon webbing with aluminum rungs and varies in length from 30 to 60 feet. The rope ladder features six weighted rungs (first six rungs from the bottom), two sets of heavy-duty steel standoff wheels, skid tube anti-abrasion  pad (additional  padding  designed to  keep nylon webbing  from  rubbing  against the  skid  tubes),  and  a  simple  quick-release  mechanism  allowing  the  ladder  to  be immediately jettisoned from the aircraft during critical emergencies or tactical situations. A Polyfoam flotation device used during water operations can be attached to the last rung of  the  ladder.  The  complete  assembly  weighs  approximately  45  pounds  (depending  on length) and is load rated at 2,500 pounds. The only authorized rope ladder for use on the H-1 is PN# ELD800PD-1.              NOTE: New rope ladder and detacher assemblies are manufactured and assembled as a “matched set/pair” from the factory. The manufacture has  established  an identification marking/system  to  both  the  rope  ladder  and  detacher  assembly  sections.  This identification marking/system will be used to maintain detacher assembly and rope ladder integrity (matched set/pair). Refurbished rope ladder and detacher assembly identification markings/system will be different than the identification markings/system of a new rope ladder,  ensuring  new  and  refurbished  rope  ladder  and  detacher  assemblies  cannot  be mismatched or mixed. identification  marking/system  and  affixed this 8.11.2.2.  Detacher  Assembly.  The  detacher  assembly  (quick-release  mechanism) includes  a  base  plate  containing  a  rotating  release  handle  and  control  shaft  assembly, safety  pip-pin,  and  two  attaching  straps.  Detacher  assemblies  are  “powder-coated,” eliminating the need to oil the assembly as a corrosion prevention measure. 8.11.2.2.1.  The  detacher  assembly  design  creates  a  three-step  release  procedure preventing  accidental  rotation  of  the  control  shaft.  To  jettison  the  rope  ladder,  first depress  the  safety  button  on  the  pip-pin,  then  remove  the  pip-pin  from  the  bracket, and  finally  rotate  the  release  handle.  Rotating  the  release  handle  raises  two  fastener AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   49  pins,  allowing  the  ladder  (under  its  own  weight)  to  be  pulled  away  from  the  base plate. 8.11.2.2.2.  The FE is responsible for providing, inspecting, and rigging rope ladders. When  use  of  the  rope  ladder  is  anticipated,  refer  to  the  attachment  of  the  AFI  11-2TH-1HV3, for Rope Ladder Preflight checklist inspection criteria. 8.11.3.  Service Life Expectancy. The effective service life for rope ladder P/N #ELD800PD-1 is a total of six years maximum. Service life consists of two three-year periods with the first service  beginning  the  date  the  rope  ladder  is  removed  from  its  shipping  container/package and is placed into initial service. At the three-year point, rope ladders will be removed from service  and  sent  back  to  the  manufacture  for  an  overhaul  “standard  refurb.”  After  the refurbished  rope  ladder  is  returned  to  the  unit,  the  second  three-year  service  life  period begins  the  date  the  rope  ladder  is  removed  from  its  shipping  container/package  and  placed into service. Once the rope ladder reaches the end of its second service life period, it will be permanently retired from “live” operations or condemned. 8.11.4.  Restrictions. The maximum number of personnel on the rope ladder at any one time is  three;  this  does  not  include  the  anchorman  who  is  only  performing  anchorman  duties.  If more than three personnel are allowed to climb the rope ladder at the same time, the excess weight could cause loss of aircraft control and/or CG problems.             WARNING: Crews will  not  use  the  rope  ladder  for  emergency  extraction  of  personnel  unless  the  threat  to personnel  remaining  on  the  ground  is  higher  than  the  risk  associated  with  an  in-flight  rope ladder failure. If used in forward flight, altitude will be the absolute minimum, airspeed will not exceed 30 KIAS, and crews will continuously assess the risks and the possibility for rope ladder failure. 8.11.5.  Emergency  Extraction.  When  the  rope  ladder  is  used  to  accomplish  an  emergency short-haul egress extraction, ensure the individual secures themselves to the center portion of the rung, and have the individual attempt to maintain body weight in the center of rope ladder and attempt to maintain a handhold on the rope ladder. Attaching a carabiner or PRL device to a rung is preferred if available to the climber. 8.11.5.1.  Using a rope ladder to accomplish an emergency short-haul egress extraction is a one-time option. Upon completion of emergency short-haul egress extraction, the rope ladder  will  be  immediately  categorized  as  unserviceable;  marked  and  tagged  as “Serviceable  but  Requires  Standard  Refurb”;  and  not  used  again  until  it  has  been refurbished. Units will send rope ladder back to the manufacturer stating reason for return and refurbishing.               WARNING: Rope ladders used as an emergency extraction device  will  not  be  used  until  the  refurbishment  has  been  accomplished  and  the  rope ladder is placed back into service. 8.11.6.  Aircraft  Rigging.  The  rope  ladder  will  be  secured  to  the  aircraft  by  attaching  the ladder straps on the quick-release mechanism via 2 steel locking carabiners (not provided by the manufacturer), with a minimum strength rating of 5,000 pounds per carabiner. Route the locking carabiner through the end of the detacher assembly straps and ensure the carabiners are secured to both the anchor cable and the cargo tie-down fittings (see Figure 8.6, TH-1H Rope Ladder Attaching Points [Right Side], and Figure 8.7, TH-1H Rope Ladder Attaching Points  [Left  Side]).  When  the  steel  locking  carabiners  are  attached  to  the  anchor  cable  and cargo  tie-down  fittings,  ensure  the  gates  are  facing  upward  and  locked,  and  the  ladder   50  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 attaching straps are not twisted and lie relatively flat on the cargo floor. The rope ladder will be  fan  folded  or  rolled  up  and  secured  before  flight.                    WARNING:  Do  not  use  steel locking  carabiners  if  the  spring  loaded  gates  do  not  operate  properly  or  if  the  locking mechanisms do not allow the gate to lock in the closed position. 8.11.6.1.  An anchor cable fabricated according to TO 1-1A-8 will be used to secure the rope ladder to the aircraft cargo tie-down rings. Ensure the steel bolt is installed through the  anchor  cable  terminal  ends  from  the  bottom  up  with  the  lock  nut  and  safety  pin  on top. 8.11.6.2.  The cargo tie-down fittings used to deploy the rope ladder from the left side are 9, 10, 14, 22, 27, 30, 31, and 39. These are the only tie-down fittings that can be used. 8.11.6.3.  The cargo tie-down fittings used to deploy the rope ladder from the right side are 7, 8, 13, 19, 26, 28, 29, and 36. These are the only tie-down fittings that can be used.  WARNING:  Do  not  use  removable  Kinedyne®  type  jaw  fittings  (i.e.,  bear  claws)  to secure  the  rope  ladder  to  any  of  the  floor/ceiling  stud  fittings;  these  jaw  fittings  and floor/ceiling studs are not approved rope ladder connection points. Figure 8.1.  TH-1H Rope Ladder Attaching Points (Right Side).  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   51  Figure 8.2.  TH-1H Rope Ladder Attaching Points (Left Side). 8.11.7.  Rope  Ladder  Deployment.  A  rope  ladder  that  is  knotted  or  fouled  can  increase  the time  it  takes  to  insert  or  extract  personnel.  Depending  on  mission  requirements,  you  may position  and  secure  the  rope  ladder  in  the  doorway,  ready  for  immediate  deployment,  or position and secure it out of the way for later use. Once positioned in the aircraft, it may be secured to the cabin floor using a seat belt/cargo tie-down strap.    NOTE: When rope ladders are rolled up instead of fan folded, they are more likely to become fouled during rope ladder deployment.  8.11.7.1.  To prepare the rope ladder for deployment, unstrap the ladder, attach it to  the anchor cable, and reposition the ladder in the doorway, ensuring it is properly folded for, deployment (this should minimize ladder fouling). Once in the doorway, ladder security may  be  accomplished  by  using  your  body  weight,  cargo  tie-down  straps,  or  seat  belts. Deploy  the  rope  ladder  by  tossing  the  last  weighted  rung  outside  the  aircraft.  The  rope ladder  unfolds  and  falls  to  the  ground.      CAUTION:  Exercise  care  when  deploying  the rope  ladder  to  avoid  striking  people  on  the  ground.              CAUTION:  During  ladder deployment  ensure  that  an  adequate  amount  of  clearance  is  maintained  between  your body and the rope ladder during payout. Failure to maintain adequate clearance between your body and the deploying rope ladder may cause personal injury. 8.11.7.2.  During night operations, a chemlight will be attached to the side of the ladder on the bottom rung. A chemlight will also be placed around the immediate vicinity of the rope ladder quick  release handle. Team  member(s) should have  a chemlight  attached to their person for easy identification. Climbers should not wear NVDs climbing the ladder to prevent depth perception issues.   52  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 8.11.8.  Sequence  of  Events.  Rope  ladder  procedures  follow  a  standard  sequence  of  events and dialogue. The dialogue transpires in three distinct phases: prior to takeoff, in-flight, and hover.  (Dialogue  is  highlighted  in  bold  capital  letters.  Any  deviation  from  the  following dialogue must be prebriefed.) (Dialogue is highlighted in bold capital letters. Any deviation from the following dialogue must be prebriefed.) 8.11.8.1.  Prior to Takeoff Phase. Prior to any live operations a thorough team brief will be  accomplished,  static  on/off  load  training  should  be  accomplished.    Following  the operations  and  aircrew  briefings  and  after  loading  personnel  aboard  the  aircraft,  the RM/TL initiates the standard rope ladder dialogue: 8.11.8.1.1.  Ensure  all  personnel  are  secured  with  a  restraint  device.  The  FE  or RM/TL will check all restraint devices for security. 8.11.8.1.2.  “CLEARED  FOR  TAKEOFF.”  The  RM/TL  advises  the  FE  when  the Team is ready for takeoff. 8.11.8.2.  In-Flight Phase. All participants remain strapped in and follow the directions of the FE. The PNF should provide crew with advisory time calls, typically 20-, 10-, 5-, and 1-minute out.  The RM/TL may require more advisory/time calls. The FE will relay time calls to any pertinent personnel. 8.11.8.2.1.  “TEN-MINUTE  OUT” Call. The PNF will announce to  the crew when approximately ten minutes from the objective. 8.11.8.2.2.  “FIVE-MINUTE  OUT” Call. The FE will reposition the rope ladder in the doorway  and secure  it by seat  belt or body  weight.  The  FE will ensure the rope ladder  is  secure  and  rigged  properly  prior  to  deployment.  Chemlights  attached  to insertion/extraction equipment  will be activated  prior to  the “FIVE-MINUTE OUT” call. 8.11.8.2.3.  “ONE-MINUTE OUT” Call. The FE may release any seatbelts securing the rope ladder in the doorway and maintain security by using body weight. 8.11.9.  Hover  Phase.  This  is  the  phase  of  flight  where  the  pilot  flying  has  brought  the helicopter to a near complete or complete stop, has adequate hover references to maintain a stable hover (into the wind to the max extent possible), and is at the appropriate hover height to  commence  ladder  operations.  The  pilot  flying  will  commence  ladder  operations  by announcing “LADDER, LADDER, LADDER.” 8.11.9.1.  “LADDER,  LADDER,  LADDER.”  When  the  pilot  flying  announces “LADDER, LADDER, LADDER,” it implies three things: the aircraft is in a stable hover (or 2 to 5 knot forward hover taxi for water ops, if desired by the customer) at the correct spot at the correct altitude, the ladder is cleared for deployment, and the team are cleared in/out of the aircraft. No other approval from the pilot flying is required to proceed with the rope ladder operations. 8.11.9.2.  “LADDER  DEPLOYED.”  Once  the  FE  has  determined  that  the  rope  ladder has  deployed  safely,  with  a  minimum  of  1  rung  on  the  ground  without  fouling,  the  FE passes the advisory call “LADDER DEPLOYED” to the pilots. 8.11.9.2.1.  Upon verifying that the rope ladder is on the ground, the FE will wave the climbers in and provide the crew with a running commentary of the team’s ascent into AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   53  the  aircraft.  During  the  evolution,  the  FE  will  give  hover  calls,  as  necessary,  to maintain the aircraft over the target area. 8.11.9.3.  “LADDER  RELEASED/SECURE.” The FE advises the pilots once the rope ladder  has  either  been  released  or  retrieved  into  the  aircraft  and  secured.  (In  an  actual tactical/emergency situation, jettison the rope ladder if time is critical.)           NOTE: For multiple  training  evolutions,  the  rope  ladder  may  remain  attached  to  the  aircraft  while ground personnel walk the rope ladder clear of the aircraft as it descends to the ground.  WARNING: Ensure all personnel are clear from below the aircraft before jettisoning the rope ladder. 8.11.9.4.  “CLEARED  FOR  FORWARD  FLIGHT”  or  “CLEARED  FOR LANDING.”  The  FE  confirms  to  the  pilot  flying  that  the  rope  ladder  is  clear  of  the aircraft or obstacles and there is no possibility the rope ladder will become fouled. Once assured  that  all  is  clear,  the  pilot  flying  transitions  the  aircraft  from  a  stable  hover  to forward flight or, during multiple training evolutions, lands. 8.11.10.  Emergency Procedures. Aside from the inherent  dangers with  using a rope ladder, the FE and climbers must be prepared to address aircraft emergencies. Multiple emergencies, adverse weather, or other unusual conditions may require modifications to these procedures. The nature and severity of the emergency dictate the degree of compliance. Therefore, sound judgment  is  the  critical  element  in  corrective  action.  Declarative  or  directive  statements indicate actions taken by the FE and RM/TL. The decision to jettison the rope ladder will be made by the AC and executed at his/her command or as briefed. 8.11.10.1.  Aircraft  Emergency.  If  the  helicopter  experiences  engine  failure  or  other critical  aircraft  emergencies  during  rope  ladder  operations,  climbers  on  the  ladder  must remain  on  it  until  ground  or  water  contact  is  made.  Upon  contact,  have  personnel  clear the rope ladder  and the  area beneath  the helicopter to  either the 3 or 9 o’clock position (depending  on  which  side  the  rope  ladder  is  on).  The  pilot  flying  attempts  to  land  the helicopter by moving forward, terrain depending. In the event of an aircraft emergency, initiate the following procedures: 8.11.10.1.1.  Upon notification by the pilot  flying of an  emergency situation,  the FE will  signal  the  climbers  still  ascending  the  ladder  “ABORT,”  and  “AIRCRAFT EMERGENCY”  (if  time  permits).  If  possible,  signal  ground  personnel  there  is  an AIRCRAFT EMERGENCY. 8.11.10.1.2.  In an emergency or if the aircraft comes under fire and forward flight is possible,  climbers  will  secure  themselves  to  the  rope  ladder  and  the  aircraft  may depart turning. This twisting and turning causes the rope ladder to become unstable, which  could  dislodge  climbers.  Slow  forward  flight  to  a  safe  area  should  be accomplished  if  flight  characteristics  and  power  requirements  allow.  Airspeed  with climbers on the rope ladder should not exceed 30 KIAS. 8.11.11.  Lost  Communication/ICS  Failure.  ICS  communications  between  the  pilot  flying and the FE are mandatory.  In the event of an ICS failure, the FE will initiate the following procedures: 8.11.11.1.  Signal to  HOLD  or  ABORT,  and  LOST COMMUNICATION.               NOTE: Hand-and-arm signals are only used to complete remaining  climbers the   54  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 the ascent of the climbers on the rope ladder at the time of the ICS failure. At no time are ascents initiated during an ICS failure. 8.11.11.2.  If  ICS  is  reestablished,  the  FE  will  direct  the  pilot  flying  back  into  position and may continue rope ladder operations. 8.11.12.  Hung  Climber.  This  is  a  member  who  has  started  climbing  the  rope  ladder  and  is unable to complete the ascent. A member can become hung for a variety  of reasons: injury, loose  clothing,  straps,  equipment,  or  physical  exhaustion.  In  the  event  of  a  hung  climber, initiate the following procedures: 8.11.12.1.  The FE will immediately notify the pilot flying of the situation. 8.11.12.2.  If  possible,  the  pilot  flying  will  descend  to  lower  the  climber(s)  to  the ground/water. 8.11.12.3.  Once  the  climber(s)  reaches  the  ground/water,  have  them  clear  off  the  rope ladder.  If  able,  land  and  on-load  the  climber(s).  If  unable  to  land  the  aircraft  for  on-loading  the  climber(s),  maintain  a  low  hover  and  have  the  climber(s)  attempt  a  second climb. 8.11.12.4.  If  the  aircraft  is  unable  to  land  or  descend  to  off-load  the  climber(s)  and  if power  requirements  and  flight  characteristics  allow,  accomplish  procedures in paragraph 8.14.10.1.2 8.11.13.  Fouled  Rope  Ladder.  A  rope  ladder  may  become  fouled  or  entangled  on  ground obstacles  during  the  course  of  ladder  operations.  If  the  rope  ladder  becomes  fouled  or entangled, initiate the following procedures: 8.11.13.1.  The  FE  will  immediately  notify  the  pilot  flying  of  the  fouling/entanglement and ensure all climbers are clear. 8.11.13.2.  If  possible,  the  FE  will  retrieve  or  attempt  to  clear  the  rope  ladder.  Once cleared, the FE can deploy the ladder and continue with rope ladder operations. 8.11.13.3.  In  the  event  the  rope  ladder  becomes  entangled,  initiate  the  following procedures: 8.11.13.3.1.  If possible, the pilot will descend, reposition, or land in order to decrease tension or untangle the rope ladder. When tension has been removed from the ladder, the  FE  will  attempt  to  untangle  the  ladder.                        WARNING:  Do  not  use  the helicopter to pull the rope ladder free. 8.11.13.3.2.  If  unable  to  land  or  untangle  the  rope  ladder,  the  FE  will  jettison  the ladder by pulling the quick disconnect pin, actuating the jettison handle, and letting it fall to the ground. 8.11.13.3.3.  In  the  event  the  ladder  becomes  entangled  on  the  ground  and  aircraft control  is  questionable,  it  may  be  desirable  to  jettison  the  ladder.  Aircraft  and personnel safety will determine the course of action to be taken. 8.11.14.  Helicopter Gains Altitude/Drifts off Target Area. If the helicopter gains altitude so rope ladder to ground contact is not maintained, or if the helicopter drifts off the target area, the FE will initiate the following procedures: AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   55  8.11.14.1.  Direct climbers to HOLD, preventing any additional ascents. 8.11.14.2.  Redirect  the  helicopter  back  over  the  target  area  or  descend  to  the  correct altitude; once back on target and/or altitude, continue rope ladder operations.   56  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 Chapter 9 LOW-LEVEL PROCEDURES 9.1.  General.  Flight  below  300  feet  AGL  is  considered  low-level  flying.    Low-level  flight entails greater risk than normal flight, so it requires additional restrictions. Low-level navigation is  used  when  flight  operations  permit  the  use  of  specific  headings  and  a  constant  indicated altitude  and  groundspeed  and  can  be  used  over  flat,  open  terrain  where  significant  terrain features are not available for navigation reference. 9.1.1.  Contour  Navigation.  During  contour  navigation,  the  pilot  preplans  a  route  based  on charted  terrain  features  leading  toward  the  objective.  The  groundspeed,  obstacle  clearance altitude,  and  heading  may  vary  considerably  based  on  the  terrain,  weather,  visibility,  and anticipated  threat.  The  indicated  altitude  will  vary  considerably  because  the  pilot  will maintain  a  relatively  constant  obstacle  clearance  altitude  in  order  to  take  advantage  of  the available  contours.    Contour  Navigation  is  more  demanding  than  low-level  navigation because it does not permit the use of standard dead-reckoning techniques. 9.2.  Crew  Coordination.  Crew  coordination  is  a  critical  factor  during  low-level  operations.  Limit  crew  conversation  to  accomplishment  of  essential  tasks.    Each  crewmember  calls  out hazardous  obstacles  and  assists  navigation  by  identifying  prominent  features  along  the  route.  NOTE:  Three  to  four  seconds  are  needed  from  the  time  a  stimulus  (perceived  closure  rate, crewmember  input,  etc.)  is  received  and  recognized  until  the  reaction  (control  input, crewmember action, etc.) is complete.  All crewmembers must be cognizant of this relationship, especially during critical phases of flight. 9.3.  Low-Level Flight Areas.  Low-level flight must be conducted in surveyed low-level flight areas.  The area or route will have defined boundaries and aircrew must meet these requirements (T-2): 9.3.1.  Complete an extensive map study of the selected routes and areas. 9.3.2.  Annotate on the flight map all manmade obstacles higher than the lowest altitude to be flown. 9.4.  Maps. 9.4.1.  For  the  Fort  Rucker  Training  Area,  maintain  a  master  map  depicting  the  low-level flight  areas  or  routes  for  flight  planning  purpose.  Annotate  all  manmade  obstacles  over  50 feet AGL, except when below the tree line. Also, annotate published low-level routes, nap of the  earth  (NOE)  boxes,  no-fly  areas,  air-to-air  boxes,  and  other  hazards  within  the boundaries. (T-2) 9.4.2.  Update the master map monthly, using CHUM data and map updates.   Annotate the CHUM update date on the master map.  Continuously scan for  uncharted obstacles.  When they  are  found,  temporarily  suspend  flight  operations  and  record  appropriate  information (location and approximate height AGL).  After landing, immediately pass this information to the unit safety officer. (T-2) 9.4.3.  Maps  used  for  flying  will  reflect  the  same  information  as  the  master  map.  Crewmembers will ensure the map is updated and annotated, using the latest CHUM. AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   57  9.5.  Route Selection (Training). 9.5.1.  Use  the  syllabus,  combined  syllabus  guide,  and  maneuver  guide  to  plan  low-level navigation training routes. 9.5.2.  Attempt  to  select  an  initial  point  that  can  be  over  flown  on  the  inbound  heading, minimizing turns from the last leg flown (recommend 30 degrees or less) and 3-12 NM from the RT. 9.5.3.  Review and de-conflict low altitude charts for IFR, VFR, and slow-speed, low-altitude training  routes,  and  annotate  potential  conflict  areas  along  the  proposed  routes  during  pre-mission planning.         NOTE: Avoid following roads or wires to an LZ. 9.6.  AF IMT 70.  Prepare an AF IMT 70 IAW paragraph 3.16 9.7.  Mission  Management.  The  Low  Level  Ingress  Check  will  be  completed  and  the  aircraft will  be  cleared  down  on  each  side  (i.e.  “clear  down  right/left”)  before  descending  into  the  low level environment. Aircraft will descend utilizing “S” turns to ensure the area is clear. 9.7.1.  Power-Available Check. Prior to any low-level operations, perform a power available check.  At minimum, OGE power must be available for all low-level training operations. (T-2) 9.7.2.  Before Landing Check. The Before Landing Check during the LL Ingress Check will be generic in nature such that the aircraft is prepared for an immediate landing if required. A separate Before Landing Check will be accomplished IP inbound to each RT. This checklist briefing will detail the RT particulars and the specific planned approach to be accomplished. Aircrew should reference any kneeboard diagrams at this time. 9.8.  Terminal Area Operations.  Crosswind turns will not normally be made prior to 50 KIAS. Downwind  will  be  flown  at  100-200’  AHO  and  a  minimum  of  80  KIAS.  Deviations  will  be briefed to the crew or flight. The type of approach being flown will determine the distance from the  RT  when  beginning  the  approach.  Attempt  to  maintain  a  constant  selected  angle  until hover/touchdown.   58  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 Chapter 10 FORMATION PROCEDURES 10.1.  General.  The primary purposes of helicopter formation flight are (1) mutual support and control and (2) increased lift capability.  In  addition,  formation  flight  enhances maneuverability and flexibility. If more than three aircraft are required, consider breaking into smaller elements. The minimum separation between the closest portions of any two helicopters in any formation is 1  rotor  diameter  (T-2),  but  the  tactical  situation  will  usually  dictate  more  separation.  Vertical step-up or step-down is optional for each succeeding helicopter. 10.2.  Responsibilities.  Every flight member has specific responsibilities that directly affect the safety and mission of the entire formation, as follows: 10.2.1.  Flight Lead (Mission Commander). The individual who is responsible for execution of the mission. This individual is identified by the flight authorizing official. 10.2.1.1.  Flight lead begins by establishing a logical order of priorities and formulating a plan.  Use  all  available  resources  to  gather  pertinent  data  for  the  mission.  Flight  lead should be assertive and communicate the plan and intentions. 10.2.1.2.  Designate an alternate flight lead who may assume flight lead responsibilities, if necessary. 10.2.1.3.  Resolve conflicts  as they  arise within the crew or flight.  A good flight  lead is always  evaluating  and  seeking  information  to  ensure  early  detection  of  a  possible problem and reduce the potential for a mishap. 10.2.1.3.1.  Flight  Lead Responsibilities. Flight lead is ultimately responsible for the flight  through  all  phases  of  flight  and  delegates  formation  lead  responsibilities  as desired. Flight lead is responsible for the following: 10.2.1.3.2.  Plan, organize, and brief the mission. 10.2.1.3.3.  Delegate  tasks  within  the  flight;  ensure  flight  integrity/flight  discipline and mission accomplishment. 10.2.1.3.4.  Delegate formation lead responsibilities, as required. 10.2.1.3.5.  Know  the  capabilities  and  limitations  of  each  flight  member  and  the resources each flight member has at their disposal. 10.2.1.3.6.  Develop  clear  and  understandable  mission  objectives  and  be  ready  to correct wingmen that are not performing their responsibilities. 10.2.1.3.7.  Upon mission completion, flight lead reconstructs the mission and makes an accurate evaluation during the aircrew debriefing. 10.2.1.3.8.  Communication/coordination with supporting or supported forces for the mission (i.e., ground forces commander, C2, local authorities, etc.). 10.2.2.  Formation Lead (Lead Aircraft). Lead is responsible for: 10.2.2.1.  Directing radio channel changes. AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   59  10.2.2.2.  Making radio calls. 10.2.2.3.  Navigating. 10.2.2.4.  Ensuring formation clearance from other aircraft and hazards. 10.2.2.5.  Directing all formation changes. 10.2.3.  Wingman. The wingman is responsible for: 10.2.3.1.  Verifying the accuracy of the mission planning. 10.2.3.2.  Being prepared to assume responsibilities as lead. 10.2.3.3.  Maintaining position in the formation and advising lead when it is necessary to deviate from any directed position. 10.2.3.4.  Acknowledging radio channel changes by position prior to initiating the action. 10.2.3.5.  Navigating and ensuring terrain or obstacle clearance independent of lead. 10.2.3.6.  Backing up lead where necessary and being able to assume the lead if required. 10.2.3.7.  Notifying  lead  if  visual  contact  with  formation  aircraft  is  lost,  flying  safety  is jeopardized, or radio failure occurs. 10.2.3.8.  Advise lead any time a significant deviation occurs that may jeopardize mission accomplishment. 10.2.4.  Tactical  Lead.  Tactical  (TAC) lead is  a role flight  members may  fulfill  based upon their SA, relative to the rest of the flight, regardless of their position within the flight, crew position  or  aircraft.  TAC  lead  is  the  crewmember  in  a  position  to  best  direct  flight  actions while  defending  against  threats,  executing  a  particular  mission  event,  or  avoiding  obstacles (i.e., the FE in  Dash-2 becomes TAC lead when  directing  a  go around or an abort.)).  Once the hazard/threat is no longer a factor to the formation, flight lead will direct the formation as required. TAC lead may change several times during the course of a mission and may change rapidly during defensive engagements. TAC lead never assumes the responsibilities of flight lead; however, TAC lead may assume the formation lead responsibility to direct the actions of the formation. 10.2.5.  Crewmember.  Each  crewmember  is  responsible  for  providing  mutual  coverage  for other  aircraft  in  the  formation.  This  includes  scanning  the  6-o'clock  position  of  other helicopters  in  the  formation  because  rear  visibility  is  extremely  limited.  Scanners  are  also responsible for notifying the pilot of all changes in the relative position of other aircraft in the formation. 10.2.5.1.  Pilot Flying (PF). In addition to basic safety and tactical considerations, the PF is responsible for the following. 10.2.5.1.1.  Coordinates defensive maneuvers with wingmen. 10.2.5.1.2.  Communicates  to  the  crew  intended  plans  of  action  to  accomplish  the mission or defend against threats. 10.2.5.2.  Pilot Not Flying (PNF).   60  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 10.2.5.2.1.  Monitors  the  flight  profile  of  the  aircraft,  providing  the  PF  with information  about  altitude,  power  requirements,  terrain  avoidance,  airspeed,  and angle of bank (AOB). 10.2.5.2.2.  Manages aircraft systems, navigates, and communicates with other assets (between flight members and to external agencies). 10.2.5.2.3.  Must be able to assume control of the aircraft any time. 10.2.5.2.4.  Keeps  the  entire  crew  updated  on  the  progress  of  the  mission  and enhances their SA whenever possible. 10.2.5.3.  Flight Engineer (FE)/Scanner. 10.2.5.3.1.  Maintains  SA  relative  to  the  terrain,  threats,  and  other  formation members.  This  can  be  extremely  demanding  in  a  threat  environment,  especially during defensive maneuvering, where the crew is often required to direct the actions of the formation. 10.2.5.3.2.  Assists in navigation and radio communication outside of the aircraft. 10.2.5.3.3.  Visually  scans  other  aircraft  in  the  formation  for  signs  of  aircraft  status (e.g., smoke, position, and leaks), or attack from enemy forces. 10.2.5.3.4.  Notifies  the  pilot  in  command  of  changes  in  any  formation  member’s status. 10.2.6.  In-Flight  Supervision.  Flight  Leads  (FL’s)  may  delegate  the  tactical  lead  to  their wingman  for  specific  tasks  or  may  fly  in  a  chase  position  on  their  wingman  for  authorized events.  While  leading  in  this  capacity,  the  wingman  may  make  decisions  for  the  flight,  but the FL will retain overall authority and responsibility. 10.3.  Safety Considerations. 10.3.1.  “Knock-It-Off” Call. 10.3.1.1.  This is a radio call any formation member can make to terminate maneuvering. See  AFI  11-214,  Air  Operations  Rules  and  Procedures,  for  specific  details.  When hearing  a  knock-it-off  call,  all  participating  aircraft  will  clear  the  flight  path,  cease tactical maneuvering, climb or descend as needed, and acknowledge with a call sign. 10.3.1.2.  If an aircraft in the formation subsequently loses sight of the formation after a knock-it-off  call,  the  appropriate  lost  visual  radio  call  should  be  made  and  lost  visual procedures initiated. 10.3.1.3.  If  lead  has  the  wingmen  in  sight  and  the  situation  requires  immediate  aircraft separation, lead should  maneuver to  ensure  aircraft separation.  Lead  will direct  a rejoin only  after  the  wingmen  are  in  a  position  where  a  safe  rejoin  can  be  accomplished.  The wingmen  should  maintain  a  minimum  of  1,000  feet  separation  between  aircraft  until directed to rejoin. 10.3.2.  “Break Out” Call. 10.3.2.1.  The wingmen must break out of formation when directed by lead, when unable to maintain sight of lead or the preceding aircraft, when unable to safely rejoin or remain AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   61  in  formation  without  crossing  under  or  in  front  of  lead  or  the  preceding  aircraft,  or anytime their presence constitutes a hazard to the formation. 10.3.2.2.  When  breaking  out  of  formation,  each  wingman  will  clear  in  the  direction  of the break and notify lead of the intent to break and the direction of break. If the wingman is breaking out due to a lost visual situation, he or she will break away from either leads or the preceding  aircraft’s last known position, the direction of turn, or in  any direction that  ensures  immediate  separation.  Lead  will  continue  the  current  maneuver  with  the current power setting to aid in aircraft separation. If the wingman is in sight, lead should also  maneuver  to  obtain  separation,  whenever  possible.  After  obtaining  safe  separation and when no further complications exist, the wingman may request a rejoin. 10.4.  Dissimilar  Formation.  Formation flights with dissimilar aircraft are authorized when all participating  crewmembers  are  briefed  and  thoroughly  familiar  with  the  other  aircraft’s performance and tactics.  RD separation is based on the largest RD diameter. 10.5.  Communications  Check.  Prior  to  formation  flight,  lead  will  conduct  a  communications check of all aircraft in the formation. Flight lead will direct an abort for any aircraft failing the check if mission requirements dictate. 10.5.1.  Radio Procedures. 10.5.1.1.  After  initial  radio  contact  has  been  established  between  aircraft,  lead  is responsible  for  all  calls  pertaining  to  the  flight.  Wingmen  need  not  acknowledge  flight lead’s to  “acknowledge.”  Wingmen acknowledgements  will  be  made  using  full  call  signs.  Normally,  en  route  frequency changes will be “directed” or “automatic,” as follows: transmissions  unless specifically stated 10.5.1.2.  Flight  lead  initiates  a  “directed”  frequency  change  over  interplane  radio frequency.  If  “pushed”  to  another  frequency  (for  example,  “Blue  33  flight,  push  preset 68”),  wingmen  will  not  acknowledge  the  change.  However,  if  “rolled”  to  another frequency (for example, “Blue 33 flight, roll preset 68”), wingmen will acknowledge the change on interplane radio frequency (for example, “Blue 99”). 10.5.1.3.  “Automatic” frequency changes are those made without prompting from lead at a prebriefed time, way point, easily identified terrain feature, or control measure such as a border or phase line. 10.5.1.4.  Only  lead  will  initiate  frequency  changes.  Lead  may  prebrief  way  points  for communication changes. A sequence sheet or communications plan indicating timing and (or)  locations  for  frequency  changes  and  communications  check-ins  will  reduce confusion  and  enhance  mission  execution,  particularly  during  communications-out procedures. 10.5.1.5.  Before  switching  to  the  new  frequency  or  as  briefed,  each  wingman  will acknowledge a frequency change by call sign in order of his or her position in the flight. Throughout the formation mission, an acknowledgment of a frequency change indicates all checklists are complete and the wingman is ready for the next event. If the wingman is not  ready,  the  reply  will  be  “standby.”  The  frequency  will  not  be  changed  until  all wingmen have made the normal acknowledgment.   62  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 10.5.1.6.  Lead will check in on the new frequency, followed by all wingmen in order or as briefed. 10.5.1.7.  If  a  wingman  fails  to  check  in  after  a  reasonable  length  of  time,  lead  will attempt to contact him or her on another radio.  If this fails, lead will direct members of the flight back to the previous (or prebriefed) frequency to reestablish contact. As a last resort, lead will initiate a prebriefed chatter mark or a brief radio call on guard frequency in order to establish contact on a prebriefed frequency. 10.5.1.8.  The  pilot  and  copilot  in  each  aircraft  in  the  flight  will  monitor  the  interplane frequency. 10.5.1.9.  Only  essential  transmissions  will  be  made.  Strict  radio  procedures  and discipline must be enforced to avoid jeopardizing safety and mission effectiveness. 10.6.  Types of Formation.  The mission determines the type of formation most suitable for the flight. For cross-country, deployment, or redeployment flights, primary consideration should be given  to  crew  fatigue.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  formations  can  be  flown  low  level  or  above 300  feet  AGL.  In  low-level  situations,  the  formation  should  allow  lead  to  maintain  flight integrity  and  still  maneuver  the  flight  with  few  restrictions.  In  low-level  formations,  each wingman will maintain a position that does not restrict lead’s (or the preceding aircraft’s) ability to maneuver. 10.6.1.  Minimum Separation. The minimum separation between the closest portions of any two helicopters in any formation is 1 rotor disk (RD) diameter, but the tactical situation will usually dictate more separation.  Vertical step-up is optional for each succeeding helicopter. 10.7.  Formation  Positions.  Wingmen  may  maintain  formation  position  by  offsetting  from leads  6  o’clock  position,  stacked  slightly  high  with  the  rotor  disk  on  the  horizon.    Normally aligning the outside of the synchronized elevator with the outside of the burner can yields a 30-deg offset.  Aligning the cross-tubes to form a double arch (McDonald’s Arch) will yield a 45-deg offset. 10.7.1.  Fixed Trail.  Flown at  1-3 RD at  the 6 o’clock position.   Limit maneuvers to  those necessary  for landing alignment in  the  LZ.               WARNING:  Flying in  the 6 o’clock position at night severely limits the aircrews ability to detect closure and should be avoided whenever possible. AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   63  Figure 10.1.  Fixed Trail Formation. 10.7.2.  Staggered Formation. Flown at 1-3 RD from the 30-45 deg aspect. Figure 10.2.  Staggered Formation.     64  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 10.7.3.  Fluid Trail. Flown at 1 RD out to 10 RD or approximately 500’.  Maintain position within  a  30-deg  cone  left  or  right  of  lead.    Extended  flight  with  less  than  10-degree  offset from lead’s 6 o’clock is not recommended, but may be required in narrowing terrain. Figure 10.3.  Fluid Trail Formation. 10.7.4.  Combat  Cruise  Formation.  Minimum  separation  is  10  RD  or  500  feet  between  all aircraft.  Wingmen have the ability to fly as needed behind the 3-9 line or as directed by lead.  It is still dangerous to maintain a position directly behind lead because of the reduced ability to pick up closure rates.  Since reduced separation is typically required for landing, lead may direct  a change to  another formation (fluid trail,  fixed trail, or staggered) at  any designated point en route (typically the initial point).  Aircraft separation distances should be driven by METT-TC  (mission,  enemy,  terrain  and  weather;  troops  and  support  available  –  time available; civil considerations).  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   65  Figure 10.4.  Fluid Formation Positions. 10.7.4.1.  Combat Spread.  This is a subset of Combat Cruise that is flown with the trail aircraft maintaining 10 to 20 deg behind leads 3-9 line.  Figure 10.5.  Combat Spread Formation. 10.8.  Formation  Taxi.  The  flight  normally  taxis  in  order  with  a  minimum  of  100  feet  of spacing from the main rotor to the tail rotor. 10.9.  Formation  Take-off.  Normal  formation  take-offs  will  be  from  the  staggered  position.  There  will  be  a  five  second  delay  from  the  last  take-off  call  made  by  the  formation  (either    66  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 acknowledgement  of  ATC  instructions  or  RT  call)  and  lifting  off  from  the  ground.    If accomplished  during  a  lead  change  on  the  ground,  the  new  wing  aircraft  will  remain  on  the ground until all aircraft have passed abeam. 10.9.1.  Delayed Take-off.  For a delayed take-off, wingman will delay five seconds after the preceding aircraft takes off. 10.10.  Lead  Changes.  Formation transfer  of responsibilities  from  one  flight  member  to  another.  The  new  formation  lead  aircraft  assumes formation lead duties. require  an  unmistakable lead  changes 10.10.1.  Formation  lead  will  direct  all  lead  changes.  Do  not  accomplish  formation  lead changes and formation changes (position or type) simultaneously. 10.10.2.  Lead will maneuver clear of the formation and then reenter the formation as briefed. Formation  lead  will  use  scanners  to  stay  clear  of  the  flight.  Variations  of  lead  change procedures will be briefed as applicable. 10.10.3.  Settings for the transponder and lights typically change during lead changes. 10.10.4.  When  radios  are  used,  flight  lead  will  direct  the  lead  change  by  stating  flight callsign,  dash  position,  assume  formation  lead  (i.e.,  “BLUE  05  FLIGHT,  TWO  ASSUME LEAD”).  The  aircraft  assuming  formation  lead  will  state  “ABEAM”  when  approaching abeam  position  and  ready  to  assume  formation  lead.  Formation  lead,  when  ready  to relinquish  formation lead  states “ASSUMING LEAD.” lead,  will  state  “VISUAL.”  The  new  formation 10.10.5.  Maintain  original  formation  call  signs  regardless  of  current  position  or  number  of lead changes. 10.11.  Breakup Procedures. 10.11.1.  VMC Blind.  Ensure all members of the formation are briefed on the specific VMC Blind procedures.  If one aircraft maintains SA while the other is blind training may continue as long as one aircraft remains visual at all times. 10.11.1.1.  If  a  crew  receives  a  “BLIND”  call  from  a  formation  partner,  a  crewmember with sight of the other aircraft should immediately announce it to the PF. 10.11.1.2.  If a crewmember who should be visual with the other formation aircraft loses sight  of  that  aircraft,  they  should  immediately  announce  the  loss  to  the  crew.  If  no crewmember has sight of the other formation aircraft, the pilot should immediately radio to the other formation aircraft (e.g., “BLUE 22 FLIGHT, BLUE 10 IS BLIND”). 10.11.1.3.  If  a  crewmember  is  visual,  the  pilot  should  respond  with  a  “VISUAL”  call (e.g.,  “BLUE  22  FLIGHT,  BLUE  22    IS  VISUAL”)  followed  by  clock  position  and distance FROM the blind aircraft (e.g., “BLUE 22 IS AT YOUR 2 O’CLOCK FOR 1/2 MILE”). 10.11.1.4.  If  no  one  on  the  visual  aircraft  immediately  announces  “VISUAL,”  the  pilot should  respond  with  “BLIND”  confirmation  (e.g.,  “BLUE  22  FLIGHT,  BLUE  22  IS BLIND”). AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   67  10.11.1.5.  If neither aircraft is visual, but lead has comfortable SA on the wingman (e.g., knew  they  were  moving  south  around  a  mesa,  with  0.3  NM  spacing),  lead  could announce “CONTINUE” followed by directions. 10.11.1.6.  If  neither  aircraft  is  visual,  and  lead  also  has  poor  SA  on  the wingman,  lead might direct the flight to execute standard or prebriefed blind actions. 10.11.2.  Instrument  Meteorological  Conditions  Avoidance.    When  deteriorating  weather conditions are encountered en route, consider options that maintain formation integrity until an  alternate  plan  of  action  can  be  determined.    The  following  are  alternatives  to  entering IMC. 10.11.2.1.  Alter the course to circumnavigate the weather. 10.11.2.2.  Reverse the course to remain in VMC. 10.11.2.3.  Send a “weather ship” ahead of the formation. 10.11.2.4.  Land. 10.11.3.  Lost  Wingman  (IMC).    Lost  wingman  occurs  when  a  wingman  loses  sight  of  the preceding  aircraft  due  to  IMC.    Prior  to  executing  the  pre-briefed  formation  lost  wingman procedure, it should be understood that if you are VMC, then stay VMC. If one aircraft goes inadvertent IMC, the situation will only be made worse if a second aircraft enters the clouds as well. 10.11.3.1.  When a wingman inadvertently enters IMC and loses visual contact with the preceding  aircraft,  it  is  imperative  that  all  members  of  the  formation  react  quickly  and precisely  to  prevent  a  midair  collision.  The  aircraft  losing  visual  contact  will  transmit their call sign, formation position, and “LOST WINGMAN” (e.g., “BLADE 22 FLIGHT, TWO IS LOST WINGMAN”). Lead will immediately initiate a breakup by transmitting “EXECUTE,” type of breakup (mountainous or non-mountainous), base heading (mag), airspeed, and MSA for that route segment. Wingmen should execute breakup procedures based  on  the  transmitted  heading,  airspeed,  and  MSA.  Wingmen  need  to  acknowledge flight  lead’s  formation  breakup  call  and  turn  their  lights  and  transponders  on.  Once  the formation executes the lost wingman procedure, flight lead will transmit any changes to headings,  airspeed,  and  MSA.  Changes  may  be  required  to  accommodate  several situations,  such  as  formation  continues  on  course,  formation  aborts  mission,  and  MSA changes for next leg of route. During the formation briefing, flight lead must ensure that the  wingmen  know  how  formation  breakup  parameters  will  be  expressed  (e.g.,  Mag heading,  indicated  airspeed,  and  mean  sea  level  [MSL]  altitude)  and  that  wingmen  can readily read the chosen values in the cockpit. 10.11.3.2.  If  an  aircraft  calls  “LOST  WINGMAN”  and  the  preceding  aircraft  is  still  in sight,  maintain  formation  position  on  that  aircraft.  If  visual  contact  of  the  preceding aircraft  is  subsequently  lost,  execute  lost  visual  contact  procedures  for  the  original formation position. 10.11.3.3.  If a wingman calls “LOST WINGMAN” and flight lead is still VMC and able to assure terrain and obstacle clearance, lead should stay in VMC. Flight lead must still make  base  heading,  airspeed,  and  MSA  calls  for  the  wingman  executing  the  lost  visual contact procedure.   68  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 10.11.3.4.  Mountainous  IMC  Formation  Breakup.  Lost  visual  procedures in  a mountainous  environment,  especially  low-level,  is  a  critical  situation  and  the  tactical environment, existing weather conditions, and terrain may require deviations. See Figure 10.6, Mountainous IMC Formation Breakup. lead immediately 10.11.3.4.1.  Upon  hearing  the  “LOST  WINGMAN”  call  from  a  wingman  in  the formation, transmits  “EXECUTE  MOUNTAINOUS,”  base heading,  base  airspeed,  and  MSA  (e.g.,  “EXECUTE  MOUNTAINOUS,  HEADING 180, AIRSPEED 90 KIAS, MSA 5,500 FEET”). If possible, the base airspeed should be  high  enough  to  allow  more  maneuvering  room  and  to  avoid  excessively  slow airspeeds for wingmen. 10.11.3.4.2.  Formation elements then acknowledge with their Dash position. 10.11.3.4.3.  Dash-2 will adjust to maintain base airspeed minus ten knots and climb 300 feet above MSA. 10.11.3.4.4.  Dash-3 will adjust to maintain base airspeed minus 20 knots and climb 600 feet above MSA. 10.11.3.4.5.  Dash-4 will adjust to maintain base airspeed minus 30 knots and climb 900 feet above MSA. 10.11.3.4.6.  Rate of climb will be 500 ft/min unless otherwise prebriefed. 10.11.3.4.7.  The  airspeed  adjustment  is  maintained  for  3  minutes  after  reaching assigned altitude, and then all aircraft will accelerate to prebriefed KIAS. Figure 10.6.  Mountainous IMC Formation Breakup. 10.11.3.5.  Non-Mountainous  IMC  Formation  Breakup.  See  Figure  10.7,  Non-Mountainous IMC Formation Breakup.  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   69  10.11.3.5.1.  Upon  hearing  the  “LOST  WINGMAN”  call  from  a  wingman  in  the formation,  lead  immediately  transmits  “EXECUTE  NON-MOUNTAINOUS,”  base heading,  base  airspeed,  and  MSA  (e.g.,  “EXECUTE  NON-MOUNTAINOUS, HEADING 180, AIRSPEED 90 KIAS, MSA 3400 FEET”). 10.11.3.5.2.  The formation elements then acknowledge with their Dash position. 10.11.3.5.3.  Formation  lead  maintains  a  base  heading  (usually  straight-ahead)  and airspeed (this may require an acceleration for large formations), and climbs to MSA. 10.11.3.5.4.  Wingmen turn away from the preceding aircraft and climb according to the following procedure: multiply Dash position by ten degrees for heading offset and stack  300  feet  above  preceding  aircraft.  If  directly  behind  preceding  aircraft,  even number Dash turn right and odd number Dash turn left to leave the formation. 10.11.3.5.5.  Rate  of  climb  will  be  500  feet/minute  unless  otherwise  prebriefed. Airspeed during the maneuver may vary from the base airspeed as needed. 10.11.3.5.6.  After reaching assigned altitude, each wingman will time for 30 seconds and then resume base heading.   70  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 Figure 10.7.  Non-Mountainous IMC Breakup.  10.11.3.6.  Instrument Flight Publications. After lost wingman procedures, an aircraft that entered  IMC  likely  requires  changes  to  settings  for  lights,  transponder,  pitot  heat,  and communications radios, as required. Instrument flight publications should be immediately available.  The  PF  should  concentrate  on  maintaining  aircraft  control  via  instruments while other crew members scan for terrain and breaks in clouds. 10.11.3.7.  Dissimilar  Formations.  When  operating  in  dissimilar  formations,  airframe capabilities must be understood and incorporated into mission planning. 10.11.4.  Rejoin  After  Lost  Visual  Procedures.  Flight  lead  will  decide  whether  to  abort  or continue the mission. 10.11.5.  After completing a breakup, formation lead will contact  ATC facilities for an  IFR clearance for the entire  formation  with  an appropriate facility. When ATC facilities are not available  and/or  formation  lead  is  VMC,  formation  lead  may  designate  a  specific  letdown point  (by  waypoint  number  or  distance  short  of  a  waypoint)  and  MSL  altitude.          WARNING: Descent from IMC in an attempt to reach VMC without the benefit of ATC is extremely hazardous and should only be used as a last resort. AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   71  10.11.5.1.  As  Dash-2  reaches  the  letdown  point,  the  pilot  will  report  altitude  departing and  descend  at  500  fpm  until  reaching  the  designated  altitude.  Dash-2  will  report reaching  VMC,  ensure  position  and  anti-collision  lights  are  on,  and  accelerate  to  catch formation lead. 10.11.5.2.  When  Dash-3  reaches  the  letdown  point  and  Dash-2  reports  reaching  VMC, Dash-3 will follow the same letdown procedure as Dash-2. 10.11.5.3.  When  Dash-4  reaches  the  letdown  point  and  Dash-3  reports  reaching  VMC, Dash-4 will follow the same letdown procedure as Dash-2. 10.11.5.4.  As the flight rejoins, each aircraft will return to mission lighting configuration after  the  succeeding  aircraft  rejoins.  When  the  entire  flight  is  rejoined,  all  aircraft  will recheck mission lighting. If any aircraft does not achieve VMC at the designated altitude, it  will  immediately  climb  back  to  its  assigned  altitude  and  advise  formation  lead.  As  a general  guide,  formation  lead  will  not  clear  the  flight  down  until  formation  lead  has appropriate weather minimums for the mission being flown (operational or training). 10.11.6.  Formation  Procedures  after  Breakup.  After  initiating  breakup  procedures,  all aircraft in the formation turn transponder to normal, anti-collision light on (position lights to steady bright for nighttime operations). 10.12.  Formation Rejoins. 10.12.1.  Straight ahead rejoin.  Normally preformed at cruise airspeed with lead directing a specific heading for the formation. 10.12.2.  Turning  Rejoin.  Normally  performed  at  80  KIAS  and  15  degree  AOB  with  a maximum  airspeed  and  AOB  of  80  KIAS  and  20  degrees.    Perform  turning  rejoins  for training purposes during the day only. (T-2)   72  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 Chapter 11 NIGHT OPERATION PROCEDURES 11.1.  Night Operations (Unaided). 11.1.1.  Altitude Restrictions. Minimum en route altitude for unaided night navigation is 500’ AHO  within  5  NM  of  the  route  of  flight  unless  published  helicopter  routes  dictate  a  lower altitude. (T-2) 11.1.2.  Illumination Requirements for Helicopter Landing Areas. Operations into unprepared sites  between  official  sunset  and  official  sunrise  are  allowed  only  if  the  area  is  outlined  by discernible lights. (T-2) 11.1.2.1.  Landing and/or searchlights will be on for all unaided night takeoffs and prior to  turning  final  for  night  approaches  unless  safety,  weather,  excessive  glare,  or  aircraft operational  procedures  dictate  otherwise.  Departures  should  use  the  landing  or searchlight until the aircraft is above departure path barriers. 11.1.3.  Crew Coordination. Mandatory PNF calls are: 11.1.3.1.  During night VFR descents, 1,000 feet above intended altitude, 500 feet above intended altitude, 100 feet above intended altitude, and intended altitude. (T-2) 11.1.3.2.  Advisory calls are IAW paragraph 7.1.2 and succeeding sub-paragraphs. 11.1.3.3.  On  final  approach  when  rates  of  descent  are  greater  than  500  feet  per  minute (fpm).  “Go-around” if rate of descent exceeds 800 fpm. (T-2) 11.2.  Night Operations (NVG). 11.2.1.  Altitude Restrictions. The minimum en route altitude is 100’ AHO in surveyed low-level areas. (T-0) 11.2.2.  Exterior Aircraft Lighting. Follow guidance written in Table 2.1 and Table 4.1. 11.2.3.  Terminal Area Operations. 11.2.3.1.  Do  not  leave  the  en  route  altitude  until  reaching  the  terminal  operations  area.  Brief  and  conduct  an  unprepared  site  evaluation  prior  to  the  approach  according  to daytime unprepared site procedures in Chapter 7.  (T-2)            NOTE: An unprepared site  evaluation  is  not  required  for  tactical  approaches  at  sites  discussed  in  mission planning and briefing prior to flight. 11.2.3.2.  Approaches  at  night  are  generally  flown  with  slower  rates  of  closure  and descent than approaches during the day.  As closure rates decrease, the time the aircraft remains in the unsafe area of the height velocity envelope increases.  Coordinate advisory calls and visual cues throughout the approach to reach approximately 200’ ASE with an approximate groundspeed of 30 knots.  During the last 100 feet of the approach, limit the descent  rate  to  approximately  300  fpm.  During  the  final  approach,  consider  using  the infrared searchlight to enhance visual cues. 11.2.4.  Crew Coordination: AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   73  11.2.4.1.  Cruise flight on NVGs is similar to unaided cruise flight.  The PF is primarily responsible for aircraft control; the PNF navigates; and the scanner provides terrain  and obstacle clearance inputs.  The PNF will monitor the gauges and keep the crew informed of the aircraft’s position, significant obstacles, and mission progress. (T-2) 11.2.4.2.  Crew coordination during terminal operations is critical.  The entire crew will help  each  other  maintain  orientation  to  the  landing  site  while  in  the  pattern.    Dropping chemsticks  during  the  low  reconnaissance  may  help  establish  a  reference  point  for identifying the intended landing spot. 11.2.4.3.  PNF mandatory calls are: 11.2.4.3.1.  During  night  VFR  descents,  1,000  feet  above  intended  altitude,  500  feet above intended altitude, 100 feet above intended altitude, and intended altitude. (T-2) 11.2.4.3.2.  Advisory calls are IAW paragraph 7.1.2 and succeeding sub-paragraphs. 11.2.4.3.3.  On final approach, when rates of descent are greater than 500 fpm. “Go-around” if rate of descent exceeds 800 fpm and airspeeds less than 40 KIAS. (T-2) 11.2.4.4.  Reduced  peripheral  vision  degrades  the  ability  to  perceive  motion,  especially while in a hover.  Closure rate, descent rate, hover drift, and altitude must be consciously and  deliberately  perceived  because  peripheral  and  instinctive  analysis  are  insufficient.  Frequent,  deliberate  head-turning  to  examine  groundspeed  and  hover-drift  is  required.  Scanners  are  particularly  valuable  in  helping  the  PF  with  early  detection  of  excessive closure rates, descent  rates, and any unintended  drift.  The scanner’s primary  duties are obstacle clearance, hover altitude reference, and drift detection.   74  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 Chapter 12 ADDITIONAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 12.1.  Acceptance and FCF Procedures. 12.1.1.  General. Acceptance and functional check flights are inherently more dangerous than normal  flights.    In  order  to  be  safely  flown,  aircrew  must  be  knowledgeable  of  aircraft systems, limits, and check flight procedures. 12.1.2.  Maintenance  Briefing.  Prior  to  any  FCF,  the  crew  will  receive  a  maintenance briefing.  (T-2)  The  briefing  should  outline  FCF  requirements,  ensure  a  review  of maintenance documentation, and clarify any questions.  After aircraft release, or at the end of the  day,  the  FCF  crew  will  provide  a  thorough  debrief  to  maintenance.    Maintenance  will ensure FCF checklists and documentation are complete. (T-2) 12.1.3.  Local Procedures. Units define their local FCF area. Follow guidance in TO 1-1-300, Acceptance/Functional  Check  Flight  and  Maintenance  Operational  Checks,  for  flight conditions. 12.2.  Search and Rescue Procedures. 12.2.1.  General.    All  SAR  requests  and  information  should  flow  through  a  single  point  of contact, such as the squadron duty controller or operations supervisor.  Their primary role is to  collect  all pertinent  facts  necessary to  initiate the mission planning.  They  will also seek flight  authorization from the commander or the  commander's representative, and advise the Joint Rescue Coordination Center of the unit’s ability to support the search. 12.2.1.1.  All  SAR  missions  are  potentially  increased  risk.    Unit  and  wing  leadership must consider mission requirements and weigh the risk potential before accepting a SAR mission. 12.2.2.  On  scene  Procedures.  Perform  a  power  available  check  prior  to  search  operations.  Perform  the  power  available  check  either  enroute  or  at  the  search  location.    Perform  the power check as near as possible to the same PA and outside air temperature as the recovery site.    Compare  maximum  power  available  with  power  required  for  the  intended  hover heights.                 NOTE: This comparison determines the power margin for the operation.  When  power  margin  is  10  Percent  or  less,  a  second  aircrew  member  will  confirm  power requirements.  Do not assume power available in flight is equal to power available at the site. 12.3.  Dropped Object Prevention.  During preflight inspections, the aircrew will pay particular attention to  panels  and components, which are potential dropped objects.  Secure all cargo  and mission equipment inside the aircraft prior to any aircraft movement. (T-1)           WARNING: Loose  objects  can  become  hazardous  projectiles  during  any  violent  maneuver  or  hard  landing.  Secure objects to prevent personnel injury or aircraft damage. 12.3.1.  Dropped-Object Prevention Program. In addition to requirements in KAFBI 21-122, Foreign  Object  Damage  (FOD)  and  Dropped  Object  Prevention  Program  the  following applies to 23 FTS aircrew: AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   75  12.3.1.1.  If  an  item  is  unintentionally  dropped  during  flight,  aircrew  will  discontinue training, note the approximate location, and report the incident as soon as possible to the Ops Sup via Blue Operations or other means. 12.3.1.2.  Ensure the dropped-object worksheet is completed prior to leaving maintenance debrief. An AETC Form 645-4 must also be completed if the dropped object is known or suspected to have caused damage or injury or was a result of an aircraft malfunction. 12.3.1.3.  While  off-station,  notify  the  Ops  Sup  by  telephone  of  a  dropped-object incident.    Upon  return,  complete  the  dropped-object  worksheet  during  the  maintenance debrief. 12.3.1.4.  Assist Wing Safety in determining the cause of the dropped object. 12.3.1.5.  If  the  dropped-object  worksheet  is  not  completed  at  debrief,  the  aircraft commander will forward a completed worksheet to Squadron Safety and MOC as soon as possible. 12.4.  Wake Turbulence Avoidance.  Pilots will be familiar with and apply the wake turbulence avoidance  procedures  in  FLIP  during  all  operations.  Use  caution  when  operating  in  refueling areas  with  other  aircraft  in  close  proximity.  In  addition,  wake  turbulence  must  be  considered when  operating  near  other  aircraft,  particularly  around  small,  fixed-wing  aircraft.  If  in  doubt, increase your distance or land well clear to preclude damage. 12.5.  Laser Exposure  Reporting.  IAW 58 SOWI 48-139.  If aircrew suspects laser exposure, immediately contact the Operations Supervisor and the Safety On-call Officer. 12.6.  In-flight  Emergency  Procedures.  In  the  event  of  an  actual  in-flight  emergency  during student training, the crewmember on the controls will apply the MATR principle and work with the  crew.  When  the  situation  permits,  the  IP  will  assume  the  controls  with  a  3-way  verbal transfer.  The  student  will  then  assist  the  IP  as  directed.  Notify  controlling  agencies  as  soon  as practical  after  completing  emergency  procedures.  Refer  to  AETC  Form  645-4  (IMT)  in Attachment  3  for  emergency/precautionary  landings  trend  data  reporting.  After  termination  of the flight, refer to the IFG PL checklist to ensure follow-up actions are completed. 12.6.1.  Forced or Precautionary Landings. The helicopter has a unique ability to land nearly anywhere, which provides the pilot with a tremendous safety advantage.  If the pilot becomes doubtful of the helicopter’s airworthiness (see paragraph 12.6.1.1) or encounters hazardous weather conditions (see paragraph 12.6.1.2), he or she will execute a precautionary landing, provided  landing  conditions  are  not  more  hazardous  than  the  in-flight  problem.    Aircrew safety  takes  priority  over  aircraft  security  and  maintenance  accessibility.    Report  all precautionary  landings  through  appropriate  channels  as  soon  as  communications  are established.  For all forced or precautionary landings reference the IFG procedures as soon as practical. 12.6.1.1.  Forced  or  Precautionary  Landings  Due  to  In-Flight  Malfunction.  The  aircrew will  comply  with  the  flight  manual  and  local  procedures.    In  the  event  a  forced  or precautionary  landing  occurs  at  a  location  where  communications  are  not  available,  the aircrew will remain at the landing site and await assistance.  However, if a greater hazard exists to the crew or aircraft by landing at a site, the aircrew will continue to the nearest   76  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 safe  landing  area.    Base  the  decision  to  resume  flight  under  these  circumstances  on  a thorough evaluation of all the hazards and risks involved. 12.6.1.2.  Precautionary  Landings  Due  to  Weather.  If  weather  deteriorates  during  VFR operations, a precautionary landing is a viable option.  Course reversal, course deviation, or continuation under IFR are also viable options.  The aircraft commander may authorize further flight after a precautionary landing for weather.  He or she will make a reasonable effort to notify appropriate agencies of the precautionary landing, and to gain additional weather information. 12.6.1.3.  Precautionary Landings Due to Low Fuel. If it becomes necessary to land due to a low fuel status, the aircraft commander will remain with the aircraft until recovery is affected.  Aircraft  will  be  landed  at  the  nearest  available  safe  landing  area  after illumination of the low fuel warning system. 12.6.2.  Downed Aircraft Site. The crew of the first aircraft discovering an accident/incident will  orbit  the  area  not  lower  than  500’  AGL,  squawk  emergency,  and  contact  Approach Control, giving approximate location and request that radar position be marked and reported to Crash Control. The aircraft will continue to orbit as long as practical, or until FLATIRON or a maintenance recovery aircraft arrives. 12.6.2.1.  Extreme  care  will  be  exercised  if  landing  is  necessary  to  render  emergency assistance to the downed aircrew. Aircraft landing at the crash site will ensure adequate safe landing area remains for FLATIRON. Pilots will monitor frequencies 30.10, 243.0, and 121.5 as able. 12.6.3.  Aircraft  Recovery  Following  a  Precautionary  Landing  (PL).    When  recovering  an aircraft following a PL for maintenance reasons, aircrew must receive SQ/CC or designated representative,  approval  prior to  takeoff, whenever possible.  Prior to  takeoff, the pilot  will ensure all maintenance actions are completed in the aircraft forms.   Additionally, SQ/CC, or designated representative, must approve all one-time flights for maintenance (e.g. downgrade Red X condition) and the approval must be properly documented in the aircraft forms by the designated aircrew or maintenance member.  For other than maintenance reasons, the aircraft commander  is  the  approval  authority.    Aircrew  will  contact  the  maintenance  operations center (MOC) as soon as possible and notify the Ops Sup of the incident. 12.7.  Fort Rucker Mishap Reporting. 12.7.1.  Aircraft Mishap Reporting. Hub radio will be notified of all aircraft incidents as soon as possible. An AETC FORM 645-4 will be completed for any aircraft damage, whether in-flight or on the ground. An AETC FORM 645-4 may be filled out at any time even though it does not meet the above requirements if, in the opinion of the individual initiating the form, the incident  warrants  the attention of 23 FTS/SE. Copies of the initial AETC FORM  645-4 will be provided to 23 FTS/SE. 12.7.2.  Ground  Mishap  Reporting.  Supervisors  will  notify  23  FTS/SE  of  all  flightline mishaps  or  ground  injuries.  Supervisors  will  ensure  an  AETC  Form  435,  Mishap  Data Worksheet,  is  accomplished  and  forwarded  to  the  squadron  safety  office  within  1  duty  day after the incident. Upon notification of a mishap, SE will inform the wing operations center (WOC) and MOC as soon as possible. 58 SOW/SE will determine if further investigation is required.  Report  the  following  types  of  situations:  Personal  injury,  regardless  of  severity. AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   77  Property or equipment damage. Injury or death to non-Air Force civilian due to an Air Force operation. Damage to civilian property or vehicles due to an Air Force operation. 12.8.  Hazardous Wildlife Reporting.  Report any hazardous wildlife activity to the OPS Desk as soon as possible. The OPS Desk will notify aircrew of any changes to the bird condition via Blue Ops Internal or via landline if unable. The OPS desk will also provide this information to appropriate controlling agencies in a timely manner. 12.9.  Bird  Strikes.  For  suspected  bird  strikes,  the  crew  should  land  as  soon  as  practical  to investigate for any damage. Once on the ground, the crew may elect to shutdown and investigate the  aircraft  more  thoroughly  for  any  bird  strikes.  The  aircraft  commander  is  the  approval authority to continue the mission or return to the home aerodrome if no damage is noted. Do not RED  X  the  aircraft  if  there  is  no  damage  but  notify  maintenance  of  the  bird  strike  as  soon  as practical.    If  there  is  damage  to  the  aircraft,  maintenance  will  determine  if  the  aircraft  is airworthy.      However,  the  aircraft  commander  still  reserves  the  right  to  discontinue  flying  for damage  and  declare  a  PL.  If  it  cannot  be  returned,  the  aircraft  will  then  be  “turned  over”  to maintenance, who will recover IAW their standard procedures for PL recovery. In all cases, the AF IMT Form 853 will be filled out immediately upon returning to home base and a copy given to maintenance and the safety office. If there’s bird strike damage, complete AETC FORM 645-4 and report to SE. The party discovering the bird strike will ensure any bird remains are collected and forwarded to SE. 12.10.  In-flight  Physiological  Incidents/Airsickness.  In  addition  to  requirements  in  AFMAN 91-223,  Aviation  Safety  Investigations  and  Reports,  AFI  48-123,  Medical  Examinations  and Standards, and the appropriate syllabus, the following applies to 23 FTS aircrew: 12.10.1.  If aircrew members aboard 23 FTS aircraft become airsick, all training shall cease until  the  situation  is  resolved.    Airsickness  is  defined  as  either  active  or  passive.    Active airsickness includes vomiting. Passive airsickness does not include vomiting but, because of discomfort  or nausea, results in  a significant  deviation  in  the lesson profile or the student’s ability  to  complete  tasks.    Following  any  flight  physiological  incident,  immediately  stop training and contact the Ops Sup as soon as practical. 12.10.2.  If passive airsickness can be resolved by temporarily halting aggressive maneuvers or  landing,  training  may  resume  once  the  aircraft  commander  is  satisfied  that  the  aircrew member experiencing airsickness is able to perform his or her duties.  If the airsickness is not resolved by this break in training or returns following it, the aircraft commanders will RTB.  In all cases, ensure all appropriate actions are taken upon landing IAW AETCI 36-2205. 12.10.3.  If active airsickness is experienced, the aircrew may land at a suitable landing area (stagefield,  FBO, RT, etc.) in  order to  establish the feasibility of continuing training.  If the active  airsickness  is  resolved,  training  may  be  resumed  at  the  discretion  of  the  aircraft commander.  If  the  airsickness  is  not  resolved  by  this  break  in  training  or  subsequently returns,  the  aircraft  commander  will  RTB.    In  all  cases,  ensure  all  appropriate  actions  are taken upon landing IAW AETCI 36-2205. 12.11.  In-flight  Injuries.  If  an  aircrew  member  sustains  an  injury  while  flying  and  requires medical attention, the aircraft commander will take the following steps: 12.11.1.  Declare an in-flight  emergency  with  ATC or Hub as appropriate and contact  Blue Ops, if able.   78  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 12.11.2.  Proceed direct to home aerodrome immediately, landing at first available B pad or as directed by Tower for transload. If unable to proceed to direct to home aerodrome due to fuel state, coordinate with ATC/Hub for the closest suitable location for transload. 12.11.3.  If a life threatening emergency exists, the aircraft commander can proceed direct to the closest hospital with an emergency room. Coordinate with Hub/Ops to allow the hospital to prepare for the aircrafts arrival. 12.12.  Emergency Coordination.  The goal of the above procedures is to get medical attention to  the  injured  personnel  as  quickly  as  possible.  The  aircraft  commander  and  the  Ops  Sup  will have to make real-time decisions to determine the best course of action.  TOD D.

This  publication  attachment  contains  information  and  procedures  for  inspecting  and maintaining  mission  equipment  currently  approved  for  and  being  used  on  the  TH-1H.  Flight Engineers  (FEs)  will  use  only  those  checklists  covering  equipment  applicable  to  their unit/mission.  Members  are  authorized  to  carry  only  those  checklists  applicable  to  their unit/mission. A2.2.  Supplemented  information  is  additional  steps  or  more  restrictive  guidance  and  will  be published as a MAJCOM supplement. MAJCOMs can further supplement this publication with additional  USAF  approved  mission  equipment  information.  Forward  supplements  to  parent MAJCOM through Stan Eval channels for approval and implementation. A2.3.  ROPE LADDER PROCEDURES. A2.3.1.  The rope ladder preflight checklist will be accomplished prior to the first rope ladder deployment  of  a  particular  evolution  or  mission.  Preflight  requirement  is  once  per flight/sortie regardless of the number of evolutions performed. A2.3.1.1.  WARNING: If any nicks, excessive fraying or broken strands are found, do not use  the  rope  ladder  for  live  operations.  Serious  injury  or  death  may  result.    Reference Figure A2.1 Figure A2.1.  Excessive Fraying. A2.3.1.2.  Excessive fraying would not allow you to see the flow/run of the fabric.    84  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 Figure A2.2.  Cut Webbing. A2.3.2.  Nicks/cuts normally occur from the side and are usually caused by improper use of a knife.  Figure A2.3.  New Rope Ladder Nylon Webbing. A2.3.3.  No  rust  allowed  on  the  rivet/washer  assembly.  Nylon  webbing  holes  for  the rivet/washer area are not allowed to be elongated. A2.3.4.  The nylon webbing is a rough texture, not smooth like a vehicle seat belt.  A2.4.  ROPE LADDER PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST. A2.4.1.  Rope  Ladder  Forms  -  Checked.  Review  form(s)  for  equipment  serviceability, overdue  inspections,  and  maintenance/delayed  discrepancies.  Prior  to  using  equipment, ensure data indicating the preflight checklist was accomplished is annotated on the applicable form(s). Annotate any discrepancies found during preflight. A2.4.2.  Anchor Cable - Checked. (IAW T.O. 1-1A-8 and this checklist.) A2.4.3.  Cargo Tiedown Fittings - Checked. Inspect for cracks, security and serviceability. A2.4.4.  Cabin Floor and Lower Doorframe -  Checked. Inspect for sharp edges and tape as necessary. Ensure cabin floor is clean of oil, grease and solvents. A2.4.4.1.  WARNING:  Do  not  use  carabiners  if  the  spring-loaded  gates  do  not  operate properly or if the locking nut cannot be manipulated (loosened and tightened) by hand. AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   85  A2.4.5.  Detacher  Assembly  Attachment  Straps  and  Carabiners  -  Checked.  Inspect  for serviceability,  webbing  for  abrasions,  cuts,  fraying,  kinks  and  knots.  Check  carabiners  for cracks and corrosion; ensure the spring-loaded gates operate freely and are spring-loaded to the closed position and the locking nut can be manipulated (loosened and tightened) by hand. A2.4.6.  Detacher  Assembly  -  Checked.  Inspect  for  corrosion,  cracks,  loose  or  missing hardware and serviceability. A2.4.6.1.  CAUTION:  Detacher  assembly  and  rope  ladder  are  manufactured  and assembled  as  a  “matched  set”  and  must  never  be  separated.  Do  not  mix  and  match differently numbered detacher assemblies and rope ladders. A2.4.7.  Detacher Assembly and Rope Ladder Manufacture  ID Numbers Match - Checked. Ensure identification numbers between the detacher assembly and rope ladder match. A2.4.7.1.  CAUTION:  When  positioning  the  rope  ladder  eyelet’s  onto  the  base  plate assembly,  ensure  eyelet’s  are  placed  underneath  the  bolt  heads.  Failure  to  do  so  will cause  eyelet’s  to  bind  on  the  fastener  pins  during  the  jettison  sequence,  preventing  the rope ladder from being jettisoned. A2.4.8.  Release Handle and Control Shaft Assembly - Checked. Inspect release mechanism for  proper  operation,  corrosion  and  cracks.  Fastener  pins  for  corrosion,  cracks  and serviceability. Pip-pin for proper operation and security. Rope ladder eyelet’s for corrosion, cracks, security and proper engagement. A2.4.9.  Standoff  Wheel  Assemblies  -  Checked.  Inspect  assemblies  for  corrosion,  cracks, and freedom of movement, serviceability and locking nuts for security. A2.4.9.1.  CAUTION:  During the rope ladder preflight or while setting up the ladder for deployment, dragging the rope ladder on concrete/asphalt should be kept to a minimum to reduce abrasion/fraying. A2.4.9.2.  NOTE:  Ensure both sides of the rope ladder are visually inspected. A2.4.10.  Rope Ladder Nylon Webbing - Checked. Inspect entire length for abrasions, cuts, dry rot, excessive fraying, kinks, knots and twisting. Pay close attention to the nylon webbing area underneath the anti-abrasion pad. A2.4.11.  Rope Ladder to Skid Tube Anti-Abrasion Pad - Checked. Check to ensure the anti-abrasion pad is not excessively worn and does not have any holes worn through the padding. A2.4.12.  Rope Ladder Rungs - Checked. Inspect for corrosion, cracks, security and worn or missing  grip  tape.  Pay  close  attention  to  the  rivet  areas,  rivet  heads  and  washers  for corrosion,  cracks,  loose  or  missing  hardware  and  for  stretched  nylon  webbing  around  rivet areas. A2.5.  Detacher Assembly. A2.5.1.  Separate Assembly from Rope Ladder. A2.5.2.  Place Assembly into Wash Tank. A2.5.3.  Wash Assembly. A2.5.4.  Place Assembly in Primary Rinse Tank and Rinse.   86  AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015 A2.5.5.  Place  Assembly  in  Secondary  Rinse  Tank  and  Rinse.  (If  using  the  hose  method  to rinse, rinse until the detacher assembly is free of soap). A2.5.6.  Set  Assembly  Out  to  Dry.  Ensure  any  entrapped  water  is  removed  by  thoroughly drying assembly. A2.6.  Rope Ladder. A2.6.1.  CAUTION:  Dragging  the  rope  ladder  on  concrete/asphalt  should  be  kept  to  a minimum to reduce abrasion/fraying. A2.6.2.  NOTE:  Rope ladders will be soaked in the detergent/water mixture for a minimum of 30 minutes. It may be necessary to occasionally agitate the rope ladder while it is soaking. A2.7.  Rope Ladder Cleaning Procedures. A2.7.1.  Place Rope Ladder into Wash Tank. A2.7.1.1.  NOTE:  Once  the  rope  ladder  has  been  entirely  worked  through  the  primary rinse tank, repeat the procedure using the secondary rinse tank. A2.7.2.  Place 3 - 4 Rungs at a Time into Primary Rinse Tank.  Work or agitate the rungs until they are free of heavy soap residue. Work the entire length of the rope ladder through the primary rinse tank (in this fashion.) A2.7.3.  Place  3  -  4  Rungs  at  a  Time  into  Secondary  Rinse  Tank.  Work  or  agitate  the rungs until this section of the rope ladder is visibly free of soap. Work the entire length of the rope ladder through the secondary rinse tank (in this fashion.) A2.7.3.1.  NOTE:  When  using  the  hose  method  to  rinse  a  rope  ladder,  extend  the  rope ladder out flat on a firm relatively clean surface. Turn the water volume on to establish a continuous  low  pressure  flow  and  rinse  nylon  webbing  until  no  soap  residue  bleeds through nylon webbing. A2.7.3.2.  NOTE:  Drying  time  under  direct  sunlight,  is  not  considered  ”excessive”  and should not damage the nylon webbing. Do not store the rope ladder in direct sunlight. A2.7.4.  Lay  Rope  Ladder  Out  Flat  (horizontally)  and  Allow  to  Dry.  Allow  the  rope ladder to dry in the open air on a firm dry and relatively clean surface (i.e. concrete, asphalt, planking,  plywood,  cardboard,  etc.).  Ensure  any  entrapped  water  is  removed  by  thoroughly drying rope ladder. A2.7.4.1.  CAUTION:  Ensure the rope ladder is completely dry before it is repacked into its container and placed back into storage. Storing wet or damp nylon webbing will cause the webbing to deteriorate and fail prematurely. A2.7.4.2.  CAUTION:  Detacher  assembly  and  rope  ladder  are  manufactured  and assembled  as  a  “matched  set”  and  must  never  be  separated.  Do  not  mix  and  match differently numbered detacher assemblies and rope ladders. A2.7.4.3.  CAUTION:  When  positioning  the  rope  ladder  eyelet’s  onto  the  base  plate assembly,  ensure  eyelet’s  are  placed  underneath  the  bolt  heads.  Failure  to  do  so  will cause  eyelet’s  to  bind  on  the  fastener  pins  during  the  jettison  sequence,  preventing  the rope ladder from being jettisoned. AFI11-2TH-1HV3  7 JULY 2015   87  A2.7.5.
