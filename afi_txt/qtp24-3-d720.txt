The trainee must accomplish all three components of the air brake check correctly.  Air brake safety devices vary.  However, this procedure is designed  to  see  that  any  safety  device  operates  correctly  as  air  pressure  drops  from normal to a low air condition.  For safety purposes, in areas where an incline is present, the operator will use wheel chocks during the air brake check.  The proper procedures for inspecting the air brake system are as follows:   5.2.3.2.7.1.  With the air pressure built up to governor cutoff (120 – 140 pounds per square inch (psi)), shut off the engine, chock the wheels if necessary, release the parking brake (all vehicles), and the tractor protection valve (combination vehicle) and fully apply the foot brake.  Hold the foot brake for one minute.  Check the air gauge to see if the air pressure drops more than three pounds in one minute (single vehicle).   5.2.3.2.7.2.  Without  re-starting  the  engine,  turn  electrical  power  to  the  “on”  or “battery charge” position.  Begin fanning off the air pressure by rapidly applying and releasing the foot brake.  Low air warning devices (buzzer, light, flag) should activate  before  air  pressure  drops  below  60  psi  or  level  specified  by  the manufacturer. 5.2.3.2.7.3.  Continue  to  fan  off  the  air  pressure.    On  single  vehicle  types,  the parking brake valve should close (pop-out).  5.2.3.2.8.   Heating  the  asphalt  emulsion.    Note:    Refer  to  manufacturer’s  operator’s manual and technical manual(s) for proper operation.  5.2.3.2.9.   Sign AF Form 1800.  Verify SF 91, Motor Vehicle Accident Report and DD Form 518, Accident Identification Card are on-hand.  5.2.3.3.  Post-operation inspection.  5.2.3.3.1.   Check fuel level (< ¾ tank, refuel).  5.2.3.3.2.   Ensure vehicle and components are cleaned.     5.2.3.3.3.   Park vehicle.  Ensure transmission in neutral, apply parking brake. 5.2.3.3.4.   Follow manufacturer’s shut-down procedures.    5.2.3.3.5.   Shut off lights and accessories. 5.2.3.3.6.   Drain air tanks. 5.2.3.3.7.   Post 360 walk-around.

The following are safety items and procedures to be followed during asphalt distributor operations.  The manufacturer’s operator’s manual will also provide  safe  operating  procedures  and  the  vehicle  itself  may  have  warnings,  cautions  and danger stickers that the vehicle operator should be aware of.  5.4.2.  Vehicle  data  plate.    Be  familiar  with  the  location  and  information  found  on  the  data plate.  5.4.3.  Plan the route.  5.4.3.1.  Overhead  clearance.    Check  the  clearance  height  of  the  vehicle  relative  to  the overhead obstructions such as power lines, trees, and bridges.      5.4.3.2.  Width restrictions/construction zones, over-the-road. 5.4.3.3.    Weight restriction (roads, bridges, off-road conditions). 5.4.3.4.    Inclines. 5.4.3.5.    Uneven ground. 5.4.3.6.    Soft surfaces.  5.4.4.  Over-the-road operation.  5.4.4.1.  Greater vehicle weight.  The operator needs to consider the combined weight of the asphalt distributor and the load.  This will affect the following:  5.4.4.1.1.   Operator’s ability to stop.  Do not tailgate the vehicle in front.  Allow more distance between vehicles in order to increase reaction time.  5.4.4.1.2.   Vehicle’s  ability  to  accelerate/follow  the  flow  of  traffic.    Accelerate smoothly  and  gradually  so  the  truck  does  not  jerk.    Rough  acceleration  causes unnecessary, premature mechanical damage to the truck’s drive train.  Maintain a safe speed (typically 5 mph below the posted speed limit).  5.4.4.2.  Downgrades/upgrades.    The  operator  will  use  lower  gears  more  frequently  to climb hills or mountains with increasing grade steepness, length and/or heavy load weight.  Plan ahead to identify downgrades/upgrades on the route of travel.  If possible, talk to other drivers  who  are  familiar  with  the  grades  to  find  out  what  speeds  are  safe.    When encountering downgrades/upgrades as described, the operator will need to address:  5.4.4.2.1.   Speed.  On downgrades, gravity causes the speed of the vehicle to increase.  The operator must select an appropriate safe speed, use a low gear, and proper braking techniques.  The operator must go slow enough so as to not overheat the truck brakes.  5.4.4.2.2.   Stopping.    If  the  brakes  become  too  hot,  they  may  start  to  “fade”.    This means the operator will need to apply the brakes harder and harder to acquire equivalent stopping power.  5.4.4.3.  Sharp turns.  Slow down before entering the turn.  During the turn, avoid sharp sudden movements with the steering wheel.  This reduces the chance of shifting the load in  the tank, and also  prevents  the possibility of tipping over due to  the higher center of gravity.  5.4.4.4.  Surroundings.  Operating an asphalt distributor requires the operator’s constant attention.    Many  situations  can  be  avoided  by  simply  paying  close  attention  to  the surrounding  conditions.    Road  signs  such  as  “steep  grade”,  “low  overhead  clearance”, “sharp turn ahead”, and special speed limits are posted for the driver’s safety.  5.4.4.5.  Backing.  5.4.4.5.1.   Use a spotter and hand signals.  5.4.4.5.2.   Spotters must be trained and use hand signals IAW AFMAN 24-306.  5.4.4.5.3.   Back slowly and keep the spotter in view at all times.  If the operator loses sight of the spotter, the operator must immediately stop the vehicle.  5.4.4.5.4.   See  AFMAN  24-306  for  standard  AF  spotter  hand  signals  and  additional guidance on spotter safety.  5.4.5.  Asphalt distributor operations.  5.4.5.1.  Filling operations.  Refer to local vendor’s procedures.  5.4.5.2.  Heating/warming emulsion operations.  Refer to technical manual(s) for proper procedures.    CAUTION  –  Be  aware  of  burn  hazard  due Note: emulsion/spray/bar/nozzles/hand held/hose can result in injury to personnel. to  hot liquid  asphalt  5.4.5.2.1.   Dispensing operations.  Refer to technical manual(s) for proper procedures.  Note:  CAUTION – DO NOT point spray wand at anything that should not be sprayed with hot liquid asphalt emulsion.  This may result in property damage or injury to personnel.  5.4.5.2.2.   Clean-up.  Refer to technical manual(s) for proper procedures.  5.4.6.  Tire changing safety.  5.4.6.1.  Consider  where  the  vehicle  is  located.    If  on  a  bridge,  curve,  road  with  no shoulder, etc.; it is safer to move a vehicle on a flat tire to a safe location.  5.4.6.2.  Find a location with a firm and level surface for the jack.  5.4.6.3.  Turn on the four-way flashers.  5.4.6.4.  Set parking brake.  5.4.6.5.  Place warning triangles or flares.  5.4.6.6.  Block the wheels.  If changing a front tire, block the rear wheels.  If changing a rear tire, block the front wheels.  5.4.6.7.  As required, place dunnage or cribbage under the jack and jack stand.  5.5. Vehicle Operation.  5.5.1.  General vehicle operation.  5.5.1.1.  Complete a pre-operation vehicle inspection.  5.5.1.2.  Sign the current AF Form 1800.  5.5.1.3.  Climb into the vehicle.  Be sure to use three points of contact.  5.5.1.4.  Adjust the seat and mirrors as needed; fasten seat belt.  5.5.2.  Starting the vehicle.  5.5.2.1.  To start the vehicle, ensure the parking brake is  set and the gear selection is in neutral.  5.5.2.2.  Turn the ignition key to the ON position.  If the vehicle is equipped with a starter button press and release the button once the engines starts.  Note:  CAUTION – Do not engage the starter for more than 10 seconds.  5.5.2.3.  Wait 10 to 15 seconds before reengaging the starter again if the truck  does not start on the first try.  5.5.2.4.  Once  the  engine  starts,  monitor  the  gauges  to  make  sure  they  are  functioning properly.  5.5.3.  Moving the vehicle.  5.5.3.1.  Before placing the vehicle in motion, ensure the doors are closed and everyone has their seat belt on.  5.5.3.2.  Check airbrake pressure and make sure it is in the operating range of at least 90 psi.  Refer to Paragraph 5.2. for information on low air pressure warnings.  5.5.3.3.  Place foot on the brake; select the appropriate gear.  5.5.3.4.  Make sure to check traffic conditions before pulling out.  5.5.3.5.  Refer to Paragraph 5.4. for asphalt distributor operational safety considerations.  5.5.4.  Backing the asphalt distributor.  5.5.4.1.  Always use a spotter when backing.  The operator must maintain constant visual contact with the spotter at all times.  If visual contact is lost, the operator will immediately stop the vehicle.  See AFMAN 24-306 for additional guidance on spotter safety and for AF standard spotter hand signals.  5.5.5.  Pump operations.  5.5.5.1.  Refer to applicable technical manual(s) for guidance pertaining to the operation of the pump engine and spray assemblies.  5.5.5.2.  Dispensing operations.

Release the parking brakes so the operator can move the slack adjusters. Use gloves and pull hard on each slack adjuster that it can be reached. Check slack adjuster, more than 1-inch indicates adjustments required (vehicles with too much brake slack can be very hard to stop).  Adjust it or have it adjusted. Check brake drums (or discs), linings, and hoses. Test low pressure warning signal. Shut the engine off when the vehicle has enough air pressure so that the low pressure warning signal is not on. Turn the electrical power on. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce air tank pressure. Low air pressure warning signal should come on before the pressure drops to less than 60 psi in the air tank with lowest pressure. Check that the spring brakes come on automatically. Chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes when enough air pressure is built up. Shut the engine off. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce the air tank pressure. "Parking brake" knob should pop out when the air pressure falls to the manufacturer's specification. Check rate of air pressure buildup Refer to manufacturer’s recommendation for average buildup time.   o If not within recommended time, the air pressure may drop too low during driving operations. Test air leakage rate.  o  With a fully-charged air system (typically 125 o o o o  o o  o o o o o o psi). Turn-off the engine. Release the service brake and time the air pressure drop. The loss rate should be less than 2 psi in one minute for single vehicles. Not less than 3 psi in 1 minute for combination vehicles. Then apply 90 psi or more with the brake pedal. After the initial pressure drop, if the air pressure falls more than 3 psi in 1 minute for single vehicles. Not more than 4 psi for combination vehicles. Check air compressor governor cut-in and cut-out pressures. Air compressor should start at about 100 psi and stop at about 125 psi. Run the engine at a fast idle. Air governor should cut-out the air compressor at about the manufacturer's specified pressure. Engine idling, step on and off brake to reduce air tank pressure. Compressor should cut-in at manufacturer's specified cut-in pressure. Test parking brake:  Stop the vehicle; put the parking brake on; gently pull against it in low gear to determine if parking brake will hold. Test service brakes. o o  Wait for normal air pressure.   Release the parking brake. Move the vehicle forward slowly (about 5 mph). Apply the brakes firmly using the brake pedal. Note any vehicle "pulling" to one side, unusual feel, or delayed stopping action.  
