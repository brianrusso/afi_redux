It applies to supervisors, managers, and employees;civilian personnel staffs; and civilian employees at joint service organizations where Air Force is theexecutive agent, and to other Federal civilian employees and reinstatement eligibles.  It does not apply toAir National Guard, Title 32, technicians.  This instruction implements AFPD 36-6, Civilian Career Man-agement, and implements Department of Defense Directive (DODD) 1430.2, 13 June 1981.1. Program Objectives:1.1. Program Authority. The Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) (Public Law 95-454) requires exec-utive management in the Federal Government to be the highest quality and respond to the needs, pol-icies, and goals of the Nation.  Specifically, it requires agencies to provide for the development ofhighly competent senior executives.  In addition, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)requires systematic development of candidates for the Senior Executive Service (SES) and the con-tinuing development of senior executives.1.2. Civilian Career Management Goals. Civilian career programs will develop employees withstrong professional, technical, managerial, and administrative skills to satisfy current and future AirForce mission needs.  The current force is assessed in relation to an objective force, as described in theUS Air Force Manpower and Personnel Plan.  Civilian career management will:••Identify and encourage highly qualified and high potential individuals to make a career in theAir Force.Provide employees with the opportunity to improve their skills and progress through the orga-nization.• Give employees rewarding work experiences to suit their abilities and desires, while meetingAir Force mission and staffing needs.••Provide  the  means  to  identify  and  staff  key  career  program  positions  Air  Force-wide  withexceptional performers and highly qualified employees.Strive to have career program selections and composition mirror the appropriate civilian laborforce data.• Assure planned developmental actions (e.g. training, career broadening assignments, educa-tion, etc.) are related to performance and knowledge, skill, and ability (KSA) requirementsnecessary to successfully perform in career program covered positions.2. Structure. Functional management, with civilian personnel oversight, will design the program and itsoperation.2.1. Career Program Policy Councils. Career program policy and direction will emanate fromfunctional management through policy councils, which will normally meet at least annually.  HQUSAF/DPC will establish regulatory policies and guidelines, and each council will direct the develop-ment of its program to address unique functional needs.  Council composition will represent variousfunctional disciplines and specialties within the functional community and will include female andminority representatives at appropriate grade level and background, as available.  The councils willfoster and support equal employment opportunity (EEO).  The functional chief may alter the compo-sition of the council, but membership will typically include:• The functional chief as policy council chairperson.• A senior military functional manager (typically brigadier general or above).• A senior civilian in the functional area at Air Staff or secretariat level.• Director, Civilian Personnel Policy and Personnel Plans (HQ USAF/DPC), or designee.• A senior functional specialist from each of three major commands (MAJCOM) or comparableorganizations (designation of MAJCOM is made by the functional chief usually on a 2-yearrotational basis).• Chief, Career Management Division, Air Force Civilian Personnel Management Center (HQAFCPMC/DPC) (nonvoting, ex-officio technical advisor).• Air  Force  Civilian  Policy  Division  (HQ  USAF/DPCC)  representative  (nonvoting,  policyobserver).• Career program manager, i.e. PALACE team chief  (nonvoting, executive secretary).2.2. Career Management Teams. A career management team, or PALACE team, which includesone or more functional and personnel representatives, manages each career program.  Personnel spe-cialists serve as experts on the requirements of law and guidance, while functional specialists repre-sent the needs of the functional community and serve as communication links with functionalmanagers.  A functional specialist serves as the career program manager (PALACE team chief).2.3. Centrally Managed Positions. Functional management determines the scope of program opera-tions and determines which positions are covered  by the career program.  Career program positions,including career broadening positions, are managed by career program Policy Councils and PALACEteams,  to include filling vacancies through career program referrals.   Career program functionalsalso centrally manage intern positions, which represent planned force renewal efforts.  Each careerprogram establishes and  distributes specific criteria, outlining the position categories, grade levels,etc., to be covered.  (See specific career program chapters in AFMAN 36-606.)22.4. Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS). The DCPDS supports the entire personnellife cycle of each Air Force employee to include:  recruitment, appointment, training, utilization, sus-tainment, and separation or retirement.  Career programs will use the DCPDS to identify and screencandidates for referral consideration.  The Promotion and Placement Referral  Subsystem (PPRS) usesDCPDS records to identify employees eligible for referral and then ranks them for promotion, reas-signment, or change-to-lower-grade consideration.3.
