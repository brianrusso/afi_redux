Pump activates e.  Software version displays f. Internal diagnostics.  b.  Alarm setpoints: a.  Low b.  High c.  STEL (if activated) d.  TWA (if activated)  c.  Calibration gas (expected calibration gas values) 17  AFQTP 4B051-11                                                     Journeyman Training Guide:  Confined Spaces d.  Time and date (if data logging option installed) e.  Last CAL date (if data logging option installed) —The Sirius® Multigas Detector is equipped with a “last successful calibration date” feature. The date shown is the last date that all installed sensors were successfully calibrated. LAST CAL is displayed with this date in the following format: MM/DD/YY f. Instrument warm-up period g.  Fresh Air Setup (FAS) option.       2. Persons responsible for the use of the Sirius® Multigas Detector must determine whether or not the Fresh Air Setup option should be used. The user's abilities, training and normal work practices must be considered when making this decision. Warning: Do not activate the Fresh Air Setup unless you are certain you are in fresh, uncontaminated air; otherwise, inaccurate readings can occur which can falsely indicate that a hazardous atmosphere is safe. If you have any doubts as to the quality of the surrounding air, do not use the Fresh Air Setup feature. Do not use the Fresh Air Setup as a substitute for daily calibration checks. The calibration check is required to verify span accuracy. Failure to follow this warning can result in serious personal injury or death.  To perform a Fresh Air Setup, push the ON/OFF button while ZERO? is flashing. The Fresh Air Setup (FAS) has limits. If a hazardous level of gas is present, the Sirius® Multigas Detector ignores the FAS command and goes into alarm. Once the instrument self check is complete, ZERO? flashes for 10 seconds.  If no buttons are pushed, the ZERO? automatically stops flashing after the 10 seconds have expired and the FAS is not performed. To immediately skip the FAS, push the RESET/       button.   3. The pump motor will start fast and then slows down as the instrument adjusts the power to run the pump.    4. If the pump motor shuts down and an alarm sounds, PUMP ALARM will flash on the display and the readings on the display may change. When the pump inlet, sample line or probe is blocked, the pump alarm must activate. If the alarm does not activate, check the sample line and probe for leaks. Once leak is fixed, re-check pump alarm by blocking flow.    5. Warning: Perform a blocked flow test before each day’s use. Do not use the pump, sample line, or probe unless the pump alarm activates when the flow is blocked. Lack of an alarm is an indication that a sample may not be drawn to the sensors, which could cause inaccurate readings. Failure to follow the above can result in serious personal injury or death.   18 AFQTP 4B051-11                                                    Journeyman Training Guide:  Confined Spaces During operation, a pump alarm may occur when the flow system is blocked, pump is inoperative, and sample lines are attached or removed.  When the instrument is in a gas alarm, the pump alarm may not display until gas alarm is cleared.    6. The presence of other calibration gases may cause the PID to under range, indicated by dashes for the displayed VOC reading.    7. The reading on the Sirius® Multigas Detector display should be within the limits stated on the calibration cylinder or limits which are predetermined by the user. If necessary, change cylinder to introduce other calibration gases. If readings are not within these limits, the Sirius Multigas Detector requires recalibration.    8. Instrument must be in fresh air to perform the zero. CAL ZERO flashes. To skip the Zero procedure and move directly to the calibration span procedure, push the RESET/       button. If no button is pushed for 30 seconds, the instrument returns to the Measure mode. Once the zeros are set, CAL SPAN? flashes    9. CAL SPAN flashes for approximately 90 seconds. If autocalibration sequence passes, the instrument beeps three times and returns to the Measure mode. To skip calibration and return to the Measure mode, push the RESET/       button. If no button is pushed for 30 seconds, it will return to the Measure page.    10.  Warning: Never let the end of the sampling line touch or go under any liquid surface. If liquid is sucked into the instrument, readings will be inaccurate and the instrument could be damaged. We recommend the use of an MSA Sample Probe (P/N 10042621, 10042622, 10040589, or equivalent) containing a special membrane filter, permeable to gas but impermeable to water, to prevent such an occurrence. The Sirius® Multigas Detector can be equipped to detect combustible gases in the atmosphere.  a.  Alarms sound when concentrations reach: i. ii. Alarm Setpoint or 100% LEL (Lower Explosive Limit), 5% CH4.  b.  When the combustible gas indication reaches the Alarm Setpoint: Alarm sounds Alarm lights flash i. ii. iii.  % LEL or CH4 flag above the concentration flashes.  c.  To silence the alarm, press the RESET/       button.  The alarm will stay silent if the alarm condition has cleared. 19     AFQTP 4B051-11                                                    Journeyman Training Guide:  Confined Spaces d.  When the combustible gas indication reaches 100% LEL or 5% CH4, the LockAlarm™ circuit locks the combustible gas reading and alarm and: i. ii. iii. Alarm sounds Alarm lights flash 100 (or 5.00 in CH4 mode) appears on the display and flashes.  e.  This alarm cannot be reset with the RESET/       button. After moving to a safe, fresh-air environment, reset the alarm by turning OFF the instrument and turning it ON again. To determine a response factor for a target chemical, perform the following procedure: 1.  Calibrate the Sirius Detector using isobutylene as the span gas. 2.  On the monitor, set the sample gas name to isobutylene.   3.  Apply a known concentration of the target chemical to the monitor and note the concentration reported in the display. 4.  The response factor for the target chemical relative to isobutylene: RF target gas =      Actual known concentration                              Concentration reported by instrument         For example:  A monitor is calibrated on isobutylene, and has isobutylene defined as the sample gas. When sampling 106 ppm of benzene in air, the instrument reports a concentration of 200 ppm. In this example, the response factor for benzene relative to isobutylene would be:  RF benz = 106 ppm known conc. benzene = 0.53                        200 ppm reported  When surveying, if benzene is selected as the sample gas in the Response Factor page, and 0.53 is entered into the monitor as the response factor, the instrument would use this response factor to automatically correct the displayed concentration into PPM benzene.  If a chemical has a response factor between zero and one, the monitor has a higher detector response for this chemical than isobutylene. If the response factor is greater than one, the monitor has a lower detector response for this chemical than isobutylene.    11. The STEL alarm is calculated over a 15-minute exposure. Calculation examples are as follows:  • Assume the detector has been running for at least 15 minutes:    • 15-minute exposure of 35 PPM: (15 minutes x 35 PPM) = 35 PPM 15 minutes • 10-minute exposure of 35 PPM  20 AFQTP 4B051-11                                                    Journeyman Training Guide:  Confined Spaces • 5-minute exposure of 15 PPM: (10 minutes x 35 PPM) + (5 minutes x 15 PPM) = 28 PPM 15 minutes        12. The TWA alarm is calculated over an eight-hour exposure. Calculation examples are as follows:  • 1-hour exposure of 50 PPM: (1 hour x 50 PPM) + (7 hours x 0 PPM) = 6.25 PPM (4 hours x 50 PPM) + (4 hours x100 PPM) = 75 PPM • 4-hour exposure of 50 PPM 4-hour exposure of 100 PPM: 8 hours  8 hours  • 12-hour exposure of 100 PPM: (12 hours x 100 PPM) = 150 PPM 8 hours          NOTE: The accumulated reading is always divided by eight hours.

Last CAL date (if data logging option installed) —The Sirius® Multigas Detector is equipped with a “last successful calibration date” feature. The date shown is the last date that all installed sensors were successfully calibrated. LAST CAL is displayed with this date in the following format: MM/DD/YY    m.  Instrument warm-up period n.  Fresh Air Setup (FAS) option. 15.    16.    17.     Persons responsible for the use of the Sirius® Multigas Detector must determine whether or not the Fresh Air 14. Setup option should be used. The user's abilities, training and normal work practices must be considered when making this decision. Warning: Do not activate the Fresh Air Setup unless you are certain you are in fresh, uncontaminated air; otherwise, inaccurate readings can occur which can falsely indicate that a hazardous atmosphere is safe. If you have any doubts as to the quality of the surrounding air, do not use the Fresh Air Setup feature. Do not use the Fresh Air Setup as a substitute for daily calibration checks. The calibration check is required to verify span accuracy. Failure to follow this warning can result in serious personal injury or death.  To perform a Fresh Air Setup, push the ON/OFF button while ZERO? is flashing. The Fresh Air Setup (FAS) has limits. If a hazardous level of gas is present, the Sirius® Multigas Detector ignores the FAS command and goes into alarm. Once the instrument self check is complete, ZERO? flashes for 10 seconds.  If no buttons are pushed, the ZERO? automatically stops flashing after the 10 seconds have expired and the FAS is not performed. To immediately skip the FAS, push the RESET/       button.   The pump motor will start fast and then slows down as the instrument adjusts the power to run the pump. If the pump motor shuts down and an alarm sounds, PUMP ALARM will flash on the display and the readings on the display may change. When the pump inlet, sample line or probe is blocked, the pump alarm must activate. If the alarm does not activate, check the sample line and probe for leaks. Once leak is fixed, re-check pump alarm by blocking flow. Warning: Perform a blocked flow test before each day’s use. Do not use the pump, sample line, or probe unless the pump alarm activates when the flow is blocked. Lack of an alarm is an indication that a sample may not be drawn to the sensors, which could cause inaccurate readings. Failure to follow the above can result in serious personal injury or death. During operation, a pump alarm may occur when the flow system is blocked, pump is inoperative, and sample lines are attached or removed.  When the instrument is in a gas alarm, the pump alarm may not display until gas alarm is cleared.  28 AFQTP 4B051-11                                                    Journeyman Training Guide:  Confined Spaces The presence of other calibration gases may cause the PID to under range, indicated by dashes for the displayed VOC reading.    19.   18.    20.    21.      The reading on the Sirius® Multigas Detector display should be within the limits stated on the calibration cylinder or limits which are predetermined by the user. If necessary, change cylinder to introduce other calibration gases. If readings are not within these limits, the Sirius Multigas Detector requires recalibration. Instrument must be in fresh air to perform the zero. CAL ZERO flashes. To skip the Zero procedure and move directly to the calibration span procedure, push the RESET/       button. If no button is pushed for 30 seconds, the instrument returns to the Measure mode. Once the zeros are set, CAL SPAN? flashes CAL SPAN flashes for approximately 90 seconds. If autocalibration sequence passes, the instrument beeps three times and returns to the Measure mode. To skip calibration and return to the Measure mode, push the RESET/       button. If no button is pushed for 30 seconds, it will return to the Measure page. 22.  Warning: Never let the end of the sampling line touch or go under any liquid surface. If liquid is sucked into the instrument, readings will be inaccurate and the instrument could be damaged. We recommend the use of an MSA Sample Probe (P/N 10042621, 10042622, 10040589, or equivalent) containing a special membrane filter, permeable to gas but impermeable to water, to prevent such an occurrence.

After moving to a safe, fresh-air environment, reset the alarm by turning OFF the instrument and turning it ON again. To determine a response factor for a target chemical, perform the following procedure: 29     4.  The response factor for the target chemical relative to isobutylene: RF target gas =      Actual known concentration                              Concentration reported by instrument     For example:  A monitor is calibrated on isobutylene, and has isobutylene defined as the sample gas. When sampling 106 ppm of benzene in air, the instrument reports a concentration of 200 ppm. In this example, the response factor for benzene relative to isobutylene would be:  RF benz = 106 ppm known conc. benzene = 0.53                        200 ppm reported  When surveying, if benzene is selected as the sample gas in the Response Factor page, and 0.53 is entered into the monitor as the response factor, the instrument would use this response factor to automatically correct the displayed concentration into PPM benzene.  If a chemical has a response factor between zero and one, the monitor has a higher detector response for this chemical than isobutylene. If the response factor is greater than one, the monitor has a lower detector response for this chemical than isobutylene.  23. The STEL alarm is calculated over a 15-minute exposure. Calculation examples are as follows:  • Assume the detector has been running for at least 15 minutes: AFQTP 4B051-11                                                    Journeyman Training Guide:  Confined Spaces 1.  Calibrate the Sirius Detector using isobutylene as the span gas. 2.  On the monitor, set the sample gas name to isobutylene.   3.  Apply a known concentration of the target chemical to the monitor and note the concentration reported in the display. • 15-minute exposure of 35 PPM: (15 minutes x 35 PPM) = 35 PPM 15 minutes • 10-minute exposure of 35 PPM • 5-minute exposure of 15 PPM:       (10 minutes x 35 PPM) + (5 minutes x 15 PPM) = 28 PPM 15 minutes    24. The TWA alarm is calculated over an eight-hour exposure. Calculation examples are as follows:  • 1-hour exposure of 50 PPM: (1 hour x 50 PPM) + (7 hours x 0 PPM) = 6.25 PPM 8 hours   30 AFQTP 4B051-11                                                    Journeyman Training Guide:  Confined Spaces (4 hours x 50 PPM) + (4 hours x100 PPM) = 75 PPM 8 hours  • 4-hour exposure of 50 PPM 4-hour exposure of 100 PPM: • 12-hour exposure of 100 PPM: (12 hours x 100 PPM) = 150 PPM 8 hours       NOTE: The accumulated reading is always divided by eight hours.
