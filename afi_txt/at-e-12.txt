It may contain modifications not applicable at your location.  It does not replace TO 31P5-2GPN 24-11 (Operators Handbook) or applicable maintenance technical orders which are the official directives for this equipment.   GENERAL  The AN/GPN -22 detects and tracks aircraft approaching a runway for landing.  The antenna is mounted on a pedestal, permitting it to be rotated, up to 270 degrees.   It is capable of providing service to any of four pre-selected runways.  Full precision coverage may be viewed continuously by final controllers.  This single radar system is actually two radars in one.  It is a search radar which constantly scans the entire area of coverage and a tracking radar capable of tracking as many as six targets simultaneously.  The HI PAR system generates data that displays the position of aircraft relative to the course and glide path of a selected runway.  The data displayed includes: normal video of aircraft in the antenna scan; synthetically generated symbols designating the locations of up to six aircraft that can be tracked during final approach; history of tracked aircraft over a 3 minute interval; and the glidepath, decision height and safety zone markers specified for the selected runway.  This handbook is divided into four chapters:     TABLE OF CONTENTS                                                                                   Chapter 1 - Description and Operation..……………………………………………………………7        Section A - Radar Set Control………………………………………………………….………7        Section B - Display Console………………………………………………………….……….15        Section C - Trackball Assembly……………………………………………………….………23        Section D - Control Symbols………………………………………….……………………….24   Chapter 2 - Procedures…….………………………………………………….…………………...25  Chapter 3 - Equipment Malfunctions………………………………………….…………………..41  Chapter 4 - HI-PAR Operating Limitations………………………………………….……………43  4 AT-E-12  1 January 2003 ABBREVIATIONS    FULL NAME Antenna Beam Position Control Accuracy Acquire  The following abbreviations are used in this publication.

All controls located in the operations room are for use by controllers.  They are designed so you can use the system for maximum performance.  There are three main components you need to be thoroughly familiar with; the radar set control; display console; and trackball assembly.  Each control or indicator will be described briefly followed by a description of each particular lamp indication.  The GPN -22 has several unique control symbols which are described in this section.  Get together with your trainer and go over the equipment from top to bottom.  Adjust the controls and see how they affect your presentation.  Ask questions and get to know your equipment.  2.  The RSC is normally located above the PAR assistant position, between PAR #1 and #2.  Since there is only one RSC panel in the operations room, any adjustment or activation of the controls will affect both PAR displays.

The following control symbols are used during performance checks and operations,      and will appear on the display  (See Figure 1-3) at various times. 57.  Close Control Target Symbol.  This symbol indicates the one tracked target under final approach control by the final controller.  Upon receipt of a track status coast signal (loss of radar contact), this symbol begins to blink on and off.  58.  Tracked Target Symbol.  This symbol indicates the position (range,  elevation, and azimuth) of a tracked target not under close control.               Upon receipt of a track status coast signal, this symbol begins to blink              on and off. NOTE: This symbol indicates verified glide slope, decision height, Track Quality,  Elevation Gusting Correction, Site Parameters and TDC-ABPC Data Bus faults.  The  tracked target symbol is as accurate as the close control target symbol. 59.  Reference Reflector Symbol.  This symbol indicates the position of the reference                                                     reflector and is displayed in azimuth only.  60.  Designate Symbol.  This symbol is used by the operator to select a target for tracking.  The operator positions this symbol to correspond with the position of the desired target by rotating the trackball.    61.  Reference Symbol.  This represents an elevation angle corresponding to touchdown.  It is        positioned at touchdown on the elevation display.  24 AT-E-12   CHAPTER 2 1 January 2003 PROCEDURES  1.  PREOPERATION CHECKS.  The following checks should be completed before controlling aircraft on the HI-PAR.  Check local directives for specific requirements.  a.  RADAR SET CONTROL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     (1) Depress LAMP TEST and check for burned out lamp bulbs. (2) Check TRANSMITTER indicator lamps for proper settings.   (3) Check correct runway alignment on ANT FINE meter.   (a) Needle should be in green area or no more than + or - .5 degrees off, or (b) Null indicator should read zero degrees (center position). (4) PAR Performance Check: Ensure your system is aligned and the radar track circuits are operating properly by performing a PAR Performance test as follows: NOTE: Ensure HISTORY INT is turned down to prevent burning the CRT.       (a) Ensure transmitter is in low power radiate. (b) Select normal video. (c) Press PAR PERF/TEST. (d) Move the trackball designate symbol to the elevation and range location of the fixed reference reflector and press ACQUIRE TARGET. If the reference reflector is not acquired perform step e. (e) Press MARG PERF TEST.  This causes the test conditions (power output) to be modified.  If the reference reflector still cannot be tracked, the PAR is unusable.  After completing this check, be certain to break track and press marginal PERF/TEST and PAR PERF/TEST to cause the lower half of the lamp to go out; otherwise, normal operations will not resume. NOTE: A PAR performance check should be accomplished as soon as possible after assuming responsibility of the position, and periodically throughout your watch.  Additionally, a check should be made after a runway change and any time the equipment is returned from maintenance. (5) Check TRACK MODE and verify both modes (NORM and BACKUP) are operational. (6) Ensure CLUTTER REJECT is set according to local requirements. (7) Adjust the RAIN REJ, RNG ADJ, VIDEO SELECT, and RNG GATE control for optimum presentation. 25 AT-E-12  1 January 2003 b.  HI  -  PAR DISPLAY. (1) Depress LAMP TEST and check for burned out lamp bulbs. (2) Adjust RCVR GAIN to obtain optimum target strength. (3) Adjust VIDEO GAIN by turning fully clockwise. NOTE: RCVR and VIDEO GAIN must be used to prevent loss of primary target returns.  This is necessary to detect a shift in coincidence between the primary target and control symbol and to detect traffic transitioning the PAR coverage area not under your control. (6) Verify decision height. (7) Verify glide slope. (5) Verify/center display on CRT. (4) Select desired range on RANGE SELECT control.                                      2.  RECEIVER ADJUSTMENTS.  To obtain an optimum radar presentation, you should make use of all of the various video signals available.  Your selection should be based on the aircraft's Range and the fixed and environmental conditions.  Coherent MTI is normally gored out from touchdown to the limits of the ground clutter.  The noncoherent MTI video is selected for ranges where rain squalls are present.  These selections are made by adjusting the RAIN REJ, RNG ADJ, VIDEO SELECT AND RNG GATE controls on the RSC.

To set the glide slope for the runway in use, the following steps are required:            a.  Set the desired glide slope in the GLIDE SLOPE COMMAND window.  A 3-degree glide slope will appear in elevation and a blinking fault symbol will appear at the location given in Table 2-1. b.  Depress the PAR DES CTR to place the designate symbol to the left edge of the display. (1) The new glide slope will appear in elevation. (a) The first digit (2-5) of the glide slope will appear on the corresponding range mark (IAW Table 2-2).  This will be a steady signal lasting 2.5 seconds. (2) Verification of the new setting will be displayed in elevation using the range marks as units of measure.  The following will occur simultaneously: c.  To verify the glide slope setting, ensure the AZ -EL button is in the elevation position, and then depress the ACQUIRE TARGET button. (b) The tenth portion of the glide slope (.0-.9) will also appear on its corresponding range mark (IAW Table 2-2).  This will be a blinking track signal starting immediately after the steady signal and lasting 2.5 seconds.  (The system will now automatically verify decision height).                                                                                   - 1  - 1   - 1             - 1  Table 2-1.  Unverified Indicator Fault vs. Fault Symbol Position  NOTE: All information concerning verification is based upon the Version Eleven Operating Program.  If another version program is used, the verification process may be different. NOTE: 1.  This lets you know the new glide slope setting has been accepted into the system.  If the blinking track fault symbol appears (IAW Table 2-1) on your display, the equipment is not set properly.  2.  If the glide slope setting is changed and not verified, it will automatically go to a 3-degree glide slope and indicate a fault.  Each indicator must be verified separately. d.  To verify the glide slope, repeat steps b.  and c.  of SETTING AND VERIFYING THE GLIDE SLOPE.  Figure 2-6 shows an example of glide slope verification, you must observe that the symbols are on the range marks which correspond with the number of the desired glide path.

To reposition the HI-PAR antenna to another pre-selected runway, follow these steps:            a.  Set the RUNWAY SELECT dial to the desired runway (1, 2, 3, of 4).            b.  Place the transmitter in STBY or select PAR PERF/TEST.            c.  Use the CCW/OFF/CW toggle switch to rotate the antenna to the selected runway.  Watch the             d.  Continue holding the CCW/OFF/CW toggle switch until the antenna is centered.  This is             e.  Perform a PAR performance check.                  f.  Verify the glide path and decision height.  NOTE: If the antenna position meters are inoperative, maintenance personnel must manually align the antenna through the bore sight.  Maintenance must place the antenna movement switch in the local position to prevent accidental rotation from the remote position. indicated when the ANTENNA FINE POSITION meter is centered. NOTE: Ensure you select PAR PERFORMANCE TEST before antenna rotation.  This will reduce the sidelobes and decrease the possibility of a sidelobe locking on the reflector.           WARNING: Failure to select PAR PERFORMANCE TEST before antenna rotation may cause misalignment.  Figure 2-8.  Antenna Rotation  35 AT-E-12  1 January 2003 (2) Refer to the photographs/diagrams contained in your position ready reference file. (1) Complete a facility indoctrination concerning the relation of these points in reference to  your cursor and Decision Height Marker.  Watch several runs and have your trainer point out  these points on the indicator. (1) Have your unit TERPS specialist determine the position of the approach lights and  landing threshold, then compute the altitude of an aircraft on glide path at both points and  enter these altitudes in the Decision Height Marker. 6.  APPROACH LIGHTS/LANDING THRESHOLD IDENTIFICATION.  Determine the position of the approach lights and landing threshold by the following means:                                                  b.  For others:                                  NOTE: Do not mark on your indicator with grease pencil.  7.  HI-PAR CONTROL TRANSFER.  Use the following procedures to transfer control of the HI-PAR radar between the OPS and HI-PAR segments:                                                         b.  Transfer from OPS to HI -PAR segment:                                                 (4) Instruct the maintenance technician in the HI-PAR segment to activate the RDR CONT  PAR/OPS pushbutton.  The light should change from the OPS segment to the PAR segment  on the RDR CONT PAR/OPS indicator.  Control of the radar is now at the HI-PAR segment. (4) Activate the LOCKOUT REMOTE ENABLE pushbutton.  The lamp should change from  green to white indicating control of the radar is at the OPS segment. (3) Instruct the maintenance technician to activate the RDR CONT PAR/OPS pushbutton.   The OPS section of the RDR CONT PAR/OPS will be lighted. (1) Communicate by intercom with maintenance personnel in the HI-PAR segment. (2) Ensure transmitter status is the same at both PAR and OPS Radar Set Control (RCSs)  before control is transferred. (3) Activate the LOCK OUT REMOTE ENABLE pushbutton. a.  Transfer from HI-PAR to OPS segment: (1) Communicate by intercom with maintenance personnel in the HI-PAR segment. (2) Activate LOCKOUT REMOTE ENABLE. a.  For management: (2) Verify these points by flight check.       36 AT-E-12  1 January 2003 (1) ACQUIRE TARGET lamp will light green while depressed.  (2) Lower (ACE ACTIVE) section of CHAN AVAIL/ACQ ACTIVE indicator will light  green for approximately 4 seconds indicating the computer is responding to acquire target  command. (3) Close control target symbol will be displayed on the leading edge of the target indicating  the target is under close control tracking.  NOTE: Coincidence of the close control target  symbol and target can be adjusted by maintenance. b.  Observe upper (CHAN AVAIL) position of CHAN AVAIL/ACQ ACTIVE indicator.  When upper portion of indicator is lighted attempting to acquire a target. CAUTION: If all channels are in use, you will be unable to verify the system.  If a fault indication occurs, the sixth target acquired will lose all symbology and return to target scan video. c.  Use the trackball to position the designate symbol in the path and slightly ahead of the selected target. d.  When the position of the designate symbol is slightly ahead of the selected target, press the ACQUIRE TARGET button.  The following will occur simultaneously: 8.  HOW TO ACQUIRE AND USE CLOSE CONTROL TRACKING.           a.  Determine which targets are to be selected for close control tracking.                                                                                                                                                                                                     i.  Select PAR PERFORMANCE 1, 2, or 3, for optimum target tracking: (4) Target now under close control tracking will display history trail.  (5) Any history trails previously on the display will be canceled. e.  Adjust HISTORY INT control for desired intensity of the history trail. f.  Determine whether FTC is needed. (6) If you used the last of the six channels available, both sections of CHAN AVAIL/ACQ  ACTIVE indicator will extinguish. NOTE: Where problems exist because of high ground clutter, both MTI and FTC should be used. g.  If close control target is within 15 NM, display range may be reduced to 15 or 8 NM range. h.  If close control of target is self-terminated shortly after acquisition, attempt to reacquire the target; if unable, activate the BACKUP on the TRK MODE NORM/BACKUP CONTROL.  Whether to continue without close control tracking symbology depends upon local policy.  (1) The system will automatically start tracking on PAR PERFORMANCE 2.  This provides  a medium bandwidth for tracking targets under normal approach conditions.  For optimum  target strength you can select one of the other two available settings. (2) PAR PERFORMANCE 1 provides the maximum bandwidth for tracking maneuvering  aircraft. 37 AT-E-12  1 January 2003             (3) PAR PERFORMANCE 3 will provide a minimum bandwidth, which increases the track  receiver signal to noise level on targets making low approaches in areas of clutter.                  even if CLOSE CONTROL is changed to another tracked target. NOTE: The PAR PERFORMANCE setting selected for a particular target is retained,  control, activate BREAK TRACK.  The following will occur simultaneously: (1) BREAK TRACK lamp will light red while depressed. (2) Close control target symbol will not appear on display.  Target formerly under close  control will resume status of an unselected target.  (Normal Radar Target).  9.  HI-PAR TARGET TRACKING PROCEDURE.  The HI-PAR radar uses a target data computer to track aircraft under close control.  There are different procedures for disengaging close control tracking.  The first method, BREAK TRACK, is used to disengage close control tracking without transferring to another target.  The second method is the TRANSFER OF CLOSE CONTROL TRACKING TO A PREVIOUSLY UNSELECTED TARGET procedure.  The term "unselected" refers to a target not under tracked target status.  The third method is the TRANSFER OF CLOSE CONTROL TRACKING TARGET procedure using the TRACK SEL button.  Use of either of the two "transfer" procedures will cause the target previously under close control to remain under track control.  Use the following procedures to acquire, control and disengage close control tracking:           a.  BREAK TRACK (CLOSE CONTROL SYMBOL).  To break track of a target under close                                                                                                                                                                          c.  TRANSFER OF CLOSE CONTROL TRACKING TO A TRACKED TARGET.  Press TRACK SELECT pushbutton once.  Target under close control may be one of up to five targets previously under track control.  If target now under close control is not the target desired for close control,  press track select until the selected tracked target is under close control. b.  TRANSFER OF CLOSE CONTROL TRACKING TO A PREVIOUSLY UNSELECTED TARGET: (3) Target not previously under close control will assume status of a tracked target and will  display as such. (1) Using trackball, position designate symbol in the path of the aircraft selected for close  control tracking. (5) To return close control tracking to a previously selected target, use the Track Select  Control. (4) Upper (CHAN AVAIL) section of CHAN AVAIL/ACQ ACTIVE will light, if previously extinguished. (2) The close control target symbol will indicate the target is under close control tracking. (4) Target now under close control tracking will display history trail. (3) History trails will be canceled.    38 AT-E-12  1 January 2003 10.  FORMATION APPROACHES.  The GPN-22 is a leading edge tracking system, which allows the close control track symbol to be assigned to the aircraft closest to the radar antenna regardless of its position within the flight (lead, #2, etc).  During formation approaches, be prepared for one of the situations illustrated in figure 2-9 or 2-10.  Your actions in either case should normally be limited to one of the following:                   b.  Terminate the approach when advised of a "go around" or "missed approach."    a.  Time permitting, acquire the remaining aircraft on final. #2 aircraft in flight(low/missed approach)Target symbol lockedon lead aircraft(full stop)1.Target symbol remainson lead aircraft when itincreases airspeed andexecutes low/missedapproach2.#2 aircraft leftwith no targetsymbol  Figure 2-9.  Loss of target symbol during formation approaches (lead aircraft go-around).  The lead aircraft executes a missed approach and the close control target symbol remains on this aircraft leaving the remaining aircraft in an untracked status.  39 AT-E-12  #2 aircraft in flight(full stop)1 January 2003 Target symbol lockedon lead aircraft(low/missed approach)1.Target symbol transfer to #2aircraft as it increases airspeed,overtakes lead and executeslow/missed approach2.Lead aircraft left with no target symbol    Figure 2-10.  Loss of target symbol during formation approaches (lead aircraft landing).  The second aircraft in the flight executes a missed approach.  As it increases airspeed and overtakes the lead aircraft, the close control target symbol transfers to the aircraft on missed approach.   40 AT-E-12   CHAPTER 3 1 January 2003 EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTIONS a.

Notify maintenance. a.  SITE PARAMETER FAULT: A site parameter (s) received by TDC is different from that entered in site parameter panel when system was initialized.  1.  The following HI-PAR failure and malfunction procedures are in addition to those in Chapter I.              SOLUTION: Press TDC-INIT.  This will cause all tracked targets to revert to an untracked status.            b.  Erratic or loss of radar on one display.          SOLUTION: Turn MODE-OFF/PAR FCTN off.  Transfer aircraft responsibility to another   2.  FAULT DETECTION: The operational program for the radar set includes a fault detection capability to warn of either a change or error in certain critical reference data or a data bus fault.  The position of the symbol on the display specifies which condition has been detected (See Table 3-1).                                                  c.  ELEVATION GUSTING CORRECTION FAULT: If a difference of 0.2 degree or more of elevation angle data is detected between reflector elevation angle as derived from vertical sensor and track reference reflector data, a fault exists.  If the error is 0.2 to 0.3 degree the flashing symbol is shown.  If the error exceeds 0.3 degree the glide slope cursor is automatically switched to 0 degree elevation angle and precision approach activities must be terminated immediately since elevation angle information is no longer available. b.  GLIDE SLOPE/DECISION HEIGHT CHANGE: Indicates a change in glide slope angle or  decision height.  You should determine what glide slope and decision height are actually now present to make certain that the change is valid.  If there has been a glide slope data failure, an automatic fault symbol and a 3 degree glide slope is displayed. d.  REFERENCE TRACK QUALITY: A fault exists if there is a low alarm rate (low track reflector detection rate), or a large error exists in range, azimuth, or elevation of track reference reflector. e.  DATA BUS FAULT: A failure in data transfer between the TDC and ABPC on the data interface bus in the radar set.  This is checked automatically by a periodically repeated echo test which determines if data entered into the ABPC can be retrieved by the TDC unchanged. 41 AT-E-12  1 January 2003 Table 3 -1.
