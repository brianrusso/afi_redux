Scope.  AFMC  produces  a  three-volume  set  of  Flight  Test  (FT)  instructions  containing attachments for each SUAS Group flown in  AFMC.  These instructions are numbered AFI 11-5FT Volume 1, 2, and 3, and contain the training, evaluation criteria, and operations procedures, respectively, for each SUAS Group.  AFMC uses these instructions in lieu of AFI 11-5 Group-specific  Volumes  for  Research  &  Developmental  Test  and  Evaluation  (RDT&E)  flying operations.    In  the  absence  of  published  guidance,  AFMC  units  will  coordinate  through AFRL/DO with HQ AFMC/A3V for approval of locally developed guidelines.  If possible, these guidelines will be consistent with similar guidance specified in the appropriate AFI 11-5 Group-specific lead MAJCOM Volumes. 1.2.  Recommended Changes.  Send comments and suggested improvements to this volume on AF  Form  847,  Recommendation  for  Change  of  Publication,  through  AFRL/DO  to  HQ AFMC/A3V,  508  W.  Choctawhatchee  Avenue,  Suite  4,  Eglin  AFB  FL  32542-5713.    HQ AF/A3/5 will approve all interim changes to this instruction. 1.3.  Waivers.  Unless  otherwise  specified  in  this  instruction,  HQ  AFMC/A3V  is  the  waiver authority for this instruction.  All waivers will be routed through appropriate operations channels to  SUAS  operating  unit  commanders,  and  the  appropriate  AFMC  SUAS  Flight  Operations Authority  (FOA)  providing  overall  flight  operations  oversight,  prior  to  submission  to  HQ AFMC/A3V.  Use an AFMC Form 73, AFMC Flight Operations Waiver Request, to process the waiver. 1.3.1.  Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk. 1.3.1.1.  “Tier 0” (T-0) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance is determined and waived by respective non-Air Force authority. 1.3.1.2.  “Tier  1”  (T-1)  requirements  are  reserved  for  requirements  that  non-compliance may  put  airman,  mission,  or  program  strongly  at  risk,  and  may  only  be  waived  by  the MAJCOM/CC  or  delegate  with  concurrence  of  publication  approver.    When  multiple MAJCOMs are affected, then T-1 is appropriate. 1.3.1.3.  “Tier 2” (T-2) requirements are reserved for requirements that potentially put the mission at risk or potentially degrade the mission or program, and may only be waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate. 1.3.1.4.  “Tier  3”  (T-3)  requirements  are  reserved  for  requirements  that  non-compliance has  a  remote  risk  of  mission  failure,  and  may  be  waived  by  the  Wing/CC  but  no  lower than the OG/CC. 1.4.  Unit Supplements.  Email unit supplements through AFRL/DO to AFMC/A3V for review and approval prior to publication.  Approved unit supplements to AFI 11-5FT Volume 3 will be published by AFMC/A3V. 1.5.  Research,  Developmental  and  Test  SUAS.  Aircraft  operations research, developmental, and test SUAS will be conducted IAW this instruction and approved test plans. for AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015   5  New  SUAS  Group-specific  attachments  will  be  created  when  warranted.    New  SUAS-specific attachments may be created when the SUAS reaches a maturity level that warrants inclusion. 1.6.  Inter-fly.  Inter-fly  is  the  exchange  and/or  substitution  of SUAS  operator  members  and/or aircraft systems  between commands or other organizations outside of AFMC.  AFMC operator inter-fly approval authorizations are governed by AFI 11-5FT Volume 1.  Inter-fly involving the transfer  of  aircraft  between  MAJCOMs  must  be  coordinated  and  approved  through  HQ AFMC/A3O.  (T-2) 1.7.  Applicability.  AFMC  SUAS  research  and  developmental  testing  of  small  unmanned aircraft systems (SUAS), ground control station (GCS) and associated technologies is principally conducted by AFRL.  This instruction applies to all SUAS research flight test activities including experiments  and  demonstrations  that  involve  AFMC  assets  (full  or  part  ownership),  AFMC personnel  (government,  military,  or  contractor)  or  are  AFMC  funded  (full  or  in-part).    This Instruction outlines the procedures for operation under most circumstances and shall be used in conjunction  with  other  Unmanned  Aircraft  Systems  (UAS)  or  Unmanned  Aircraft  (UA)  governing  directives,  Air  Force  approved  AFRL  flight  test  plans,  UAS/Unmanned  Aerial Vehicle (UAV)/UA manufacturer instructions, contractor-derived operating instructions, Federal Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  Certificate  of  Authorization  (COA),  applicable  USAF,  Navy, Army,  Marine  Corp  or  DoD  directives  as  well  as  Federal  Air  Regulations,    and  International Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  Standards  and  Recommended  Practices.    Operations  or procedures  not  specifically  addressed  may  be  accomplished  if  they  enhance  safe,  effective mission  accomplishment.    The  terms  “air  vehicle”  and  “unmanned  aircraft”  may  be  used interchangeably, both mean the airborne portion of the system that operates in the air. 1.8.  Crew.  The  crew  is  defined  as  the  personnel  responsible  for  safe  operation  of  the  SUAS aircraft  and  mission.  Training  requirements  for  these  positions  can  be  found  in  AFI  11-502 Volume 1 and AFI 11-5FT Volume 1. 1.8.1.  Test  Conductor.  Equivalent  to  a  Mission  Commander  (MC)  for  the  mission. Responsible for crew coordination and over-all flight test mission execution.  Final decision authority for test issues.  Responsible for coordinating multiple air vehicle operations.  The individual  selected  as  test  conductor  must  undergo  training  and  be  annotated  on  the  unit Letter of X’s. 1.8.2.  SUAS  Operator  (SUAS-O).    Controls  the  SUAS  by  commands  given  through  an autopilot (known as the Internal Operator) or directly manipulates flight controls and engine power through radio control (R/C) (also known as the External Operator).  See AFI 11-5FT Volume  1  for  further  distinctions  between  the  two.    The  SUAS-O  is  responsible  for  the airborne  control  function  of  the  unmanned  air  vehicle,  assembling  and  verifying  positive control  of  the  ground  station  and/or  remote  control  unit,  loading  and/or  final  verification authority for flight  plans, and monitors the health, performance and position of the aircraft.  The SUAS-O may also act as a radio operator, monitoring and making appropriate radio calls to ground or air control tower, range operations or other personnel involved with the flight or ground  operation.    Military,  government  civilian,  and  contractor  pilots  operating  USAF SUAS will be trained and qualified IAW this Instruction and AFI 11-5FT Volumes 1 and 2. 1.8.2.1.  Pilot  in  Command  Authority.    The  Lead  SUAS-O  (Pilot  in  Command-equivalent) is ultimately responsible for the safe operation of the aircraft.  SUAS-O’s act as the Lead SUAS-O of SUAS when they are the primary controller.  Each aircraft must   6  AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015 have a dedicated Lead SUAS-O at all times.  Although test requirements may call for a SUAS-O  to  control  more  than  one  aircraft  at  a  time,  SUAS-Os  may  not  serve  as  Lead SUAS-O for two or more aircraft simultaneously unless approved to do so by the waiver authority for this Instruction.  (T-2) 1.8.2.2.  Lead  SUAS-O  (PIC).  Unless  SUAS  pilot  qualification  training  is  being conducted, only one controller at a time can be designated and log Lead SUAS-O time.  The terms “pilot” and “operator” may be used interchangeably but there shall only be one Lead  SUAS-O/Pilot-in-Command-equivalent  of  a  vehicle  (or  multiple  vehicles)  at  any given  time.    Commonly  a  radio  control  operator  acting  as  Lead  SUAS-O  may  takeoff, land  and  handle  in-flight  emergencies  (especially  loss  of  ground  station  control)  while handing off control to the ground control station operator for conduct of the test mission.  Proper management of who is in control and acting as Lead SUAS-O of an air vehicle, as well  as  hand-off  procedures  between  the  Lead  SUAS-O  and  other  air  vehicle  operators during mission execution, must be briefed before any test and is the responsibility of the Test Conductor to ensure there is no confusion.  See paragraph 5.9 for standard transfer of aircraft control procedures. 1.8.3.  SUAS Payload Operator.  The SUAS Payload Operator may operate any sensor, test article, or other payload during the test.  They may also act as a Flight Test Engineer (FTE) and monitor health sensors for propulsion, electrical, hydraulics or other components of the flight  test  air  vehicle.    Other  functions  might  include  assisting  the  SUAS-O    and  Test Conductor in the conduct of the flight, by reading and accomplishing assigned checklists, or acting  as a designated radio  operator, by monitoring and making  appropriate  radio  calls to ground, control tower, Range Operations or other personnel attached involved with the flight operation.  Specific Payload Operator duties for a given SUAS mission shall be briefed and thoroughly understood before the start of the mission. 1.8.4.  Ground  Support.    This  crewmember  assembles  the  air  vehicle  and  launch/recovery mechanism, fuels/de-fuels the air vehicle, installs battery, tensions and operates catapult for launch,  assembles  and  maintains  recovery  systems,  and  provides  general  maintenance  or repair to the air vehicle.  They may start engines and install payload under the supervision of the Lead SUAS-O.  Due to the unique differences possible in SUAS Groups, each test plan will  specify  detailed  training  for  Ground  Support  personnel  that  is  specific  to  each  SUAS being  used  in  that  test  plan.    Ground  Support  personnel  will  not  perform  duties  without receiving and documenting test plan specified training.  AFRL/DO can also request approval from AFMC/A3V for Ground Support training plans that are independent of any test plans. 1.8.5.  Observers.    Dedicated  observers  assist  the  SUAS-O  in  duties  associated  with  safe aircraft  separation,  terrain/obstacle  clearance  avoidance,  and  cloud  clearance.    Chase  pilots (airborne  Observers),  if  used,  may  not  concurrently  perform  Observer  or  SUAS-O  duties along  with  chase  pilot  duties  while  operating  outside  Restricted,  Prohibited,  or  Warning Areas.    See  AFI  11-502  Volume  3,  paragraph  10.6.for  additional  specifics  on  Observer requirements  and  duties.    A  FAA  Certificate  of  Authorization  may  levy  additional requirements on Observers.  (T-3) 1.9.  SUAS System Considerations. 1.9.1.  Onboard Cameras/Sensors: Although onboard cameras and sensors that are positioned to  observe  targets  on  the  ground  have  demonstrated  some  capability,  their  use  in  detecting AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015   7  airborne  operations  for  the  purpose  of  air  traffic  deconfliction  is  still  quite  limited.    In general, current designs are not mature and have shown to be insufficient to provide the sole mitigation for “see and avoid” equivalency.  Although these systems are currently immature, applicants may be allowed to propose any system solution that provides a mitigation strategy and will be evaluated as a potential solution. 1.9.2.  Radar  and  Other  Sensors:  If  special  types  of  radar  or  other  sensors  are  utilized  to mitigate  risk,  the  applicant  must  provide  supporting  data  which  demonstrates  that  both cooperative  and  non-cooperative  aircraft,  including  targets  with  low  radar  reflectivity,  such as gliders and balloons, can be consistently identified at all operational altitudes and ranges, and the proposed system can effectively avoid a potential collision. 1.9.3.  Lost Link Procedures: In all cases, UAS must be provided with a means of automatic flight termination or backup recovery in the event of a lost command link.  There are many acceptable approaches to satisfy the requirement.  The intent is to ensure airborne operations are predictable and containable in the event of lost command link. 1.9.4.  Flight  Termination  System  (FTS):  It  is  highly  desirable  that  all  SUAS  tests  have system  redundancies  and  independent  functionality  to  ensure  the  overall  safety  and predictability  of  the  system.    If  a  UAS  is  found  to  be  lacking  in  system  redundancies,  an independent  flight  termination  system  that  can  be  activated  manually  by  the  UAS  Lead SUAS-O may be required to safeguard the public.  The approval authority for flying a SUAS without FTS is AFRL/CV.  (T-2)   8  AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 2 MISSION PLANNING 2.1.  General.  SUAS  Operators  are  ultimately  responsible  for  ensuring  all  mission  planning materials  are  current  and  command  guidance  is  followed.    A  Lead  SUAS  Operator  will  be designated  for  all  SUAS  missions.    All  crew  members  must  be  present  for  mission  planning unless  released  by  the  Lead  SUAS-O.    SUAS  RDT&E  Flight  Operations,  covered  by  this instruction and consisting of one or more missions, including taxi, shall only be conducted IAW an  approved  test  or  training  plan.    Mission  planning,  briefing,  and  debriefing  are  required activities. 2.1.1.  The Test Conductor is responsible for briefing and developing the test plan.  Mission planning  and  briefing  are  two  separate  activities.    The  Test  Conductor  and  Lead  SUAS-O will jointly review test plans to ensure safety and mission effectiveness.  Personnel other than the crew flying the mission may accomplish mission planning; however, the Lead SUAS-O is responsible for ensuring that the mission planning is complete and accurate. 2.2.  Mission  Planning  Requirements.  The  unit  commander  must  ensure  that  a  flight operations  area is  available  with  adequate  space  for  operations  management,  flight planning/briefing,  and  required  publications.    The  unit  commander  will  ensure  that  SUAS operators are provided the following: 2.2.1.  Mission requirements and schedule of events. 2.2.2.  Briefing facilities and aids described in paragraph 2.9. 2.2.3.  Appropriate regulations and flight manuals (including Partial and Modification Flight Manuals  (MFMs))  must  be  located  in  the  unit.    A  current  copy  (paper  or  electronic)  of  all applicable flight manuals and technical orders is required in the FCIF library and Operations Supervisor’s (or unit equivalent) desk.  If a conventional paper copy of a flight manual is not available  through  distribution  or  local  printing,  then  two  independent  methods  of  accessing the  electronic  flight  manual  must  be  available  that  have  been  verified  to  be  current  and operational.    Refer  to  AFI  11-502  Vol  2  and  AFMC  Sup  1  for  FCIF  library  requirements.  Refer to AFI 11-202 Vol 3, AFMC Sup 1, for additional details on electronic FCIF libraries. 2.3.  Air Vehicle Performance Data.  All Air Vehicle Performance Data relevant to the mission to  be  flown,  including  fuel  quantity,  rates  of  fuel  consumption,  runway  distances  required  for takeoff and landing, shall be available and consulted during mission planning. 2.4.  Mission  Planning  Materials.  Maps  and  Charts.    Current  Maps  and  Charts,  of  sufficient accuracy  and  appropriate  to  the  missions  being  flown,  shall  be  used  for  mission  planning.    A local area map of sufficient detail to remain within assigned flight test operational areas will be available to crewmembers.  The most recent maps will be loaded into the GCS. 2.4.1.  In-flight  Manuals/Directives.  The  Lead  SUAS-O  will  ensure  that  applicable  flight manuals, checklists, and mission related directives (if required) for all mission required crew positions are readily accessible during SUAS ground and flight operations.  The responsible FOA will determine required mission and mission-related directives.  If a conventional paper copy  of  a  flight  manual  is  not  available  through  distribution  or  local  printing,  then  two AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015   9  independent methods of accessing the electronic flight manual that have been verified to be current and operational must be available to the crew. 2.5.  Local  SUAS Operator Aids.  SUAS Operator Aids may be published and will be tailored to  aid  the  unit  in  performing  its  mission.    Unit  SUAS  Operator  Aids  may  be  tailored  for  each Mission Design Series (MDS)-equivalent or RDT&E SUAS as necessary.  The following areas are recommended for inclusion: 2.5.1.  Airfield and standard operations setup diagrams. 2.5.2.  Local radio channelization. 2.5.3.  Takeoff and landing data. 2.5.4.  Weight and balance data. 2.5.5.  Impoundment procedures. 2.5.6.  Emergency action checklists. 2.5.7.  NORDO  (Loss  of  team  radio  communication  with  range/Air  Traffic  Control) procedures. 2.5.8.  Recovery procedures with releasable stores/weapons onboard and jettison areas. 2.5.9.  Alternate recovery areas and procedures. 2.5.10.  Other information as deemed necessary (e.g. canned airspace/flight plans, turnaround procedures, local training areas, systems and lost-comm programming preflight, etc). 2.6.  Test  Cards.  Flight  test  cards  will  be  constructed  and  approved  according  to  local procedures.    A  copy  of  the  test  cards  will  be  filed  with  a  SUAS  operations  supervisor  for reference. 2.7.  Briefing/Debriefing Room Requirements.  Use of adequate briefing room and materials is required for initial mission briefs.  Follow-on briefings and/or update briefing locations will be at the discretion of the Lead SUAS-O.  Briefing rooms will be private and of adequate size to seat required crewmembers and test team members.  They may be multipurpose rooms, but privacy must be ensured during SUAS operation mission briefings.  Briefings will utilize, electronically or otherwise: 2.7.1.  Briefing  guides  for  applicable  missions  and  supplemental  material  as  locally determined, such as Emergency Procedure of the Day lists, etc. 2.7.2.  A dry-erase board or suitable substitute. 2.7.3.  Visual aids (such as slide display boards, charts, briefing books, viewgraphs, computer display, etc.) to adequately present, as applicable to the test team, the following: 2.7.3.1.  Airfield diagrams depicting runways, taxiways, parking areas, and other special use areas as appropriate. 2.7.3.2.  Training  rules  (air-to-air,  air-to-ground,  chase,  intercept,  low  level,  etc.),  when appropriate. 2.7.3.3.  Local  area  charts  depicting  the  planned  flying  area;  VFR  patterns,  including entry and departure procedures; special use airspace; alternate airfields; air-to-air, air-to-  10  AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015 ground, Functional Check Flight (FCF), jettison, drop zone or salvo areas normally used by the unit. 2.8.  Briefing/De-briefing. 2.8.1.  Mission  Brief/Debrief.  The  Lead  SUAS-O  is  responsible  for  presenting  a  logical briefing  to  all  crewmembers  that  promotes  safe,  effective,  mission  accomplishment.    A structured,  logical  debrief  of  the  test  flight  will  be  conducted  at  the  completion  of  each mission.  Use briefing guides to provide a reference list of items that may apply to particular missions.  Items listed may be briefed in any sequence.  The extent and depth of the briefings will  depend  on  the  type  of  flight,  complexity  of  the  tests  and  equipment,  previous  mission and flight crew experience.  These requirements are specified in AFI 11-502 Volume 3 para 2.4 and/or AFI 11-502 Volume 3 AFMC Sup 1. 2.8.2.  Standards.    Those  briefing  items  understood  by  all  participants  may  be  briefed  as "standard".  Units may use standards as long as they are in a published document.  However, during  sorties  where  trainees  or  unassigned  personnel  are  in  the  flight,  all  items  will  be briefed. 2.8.3.  All  crewmembers  and  required  test  support  personnel  will  attend  the  flight  briefing unless previously briefed and excused by the Lead SUAS-O. 2.8.4.  All  aspects  of  the  test  plan  will  be  thoroughly  briefed  by  the  Lead  SUAS-O  or  Test Conductor to include mission and test objectives.  Briefings will include actions to terminate the  flight  test  profile  if  required.    Each  flight  will  brief  an  alternate  mission,  if  applicable.  The alternate mission will be less complex than the primary.  Briefed mission elements and events  may  be  modified  and  briefed  airborne  as  long  as  flight  safety  is  not  compromised.  Missions or events not briefed prior to mission execution will not be flown.  Flight leads will ensure changes are acknowledged by all flight members. 2.8.5.  If  the  flight  briefing  was  conducted  prior  to  the  day  of  the  flight,  the  Lead  SUAS-O will  ensure  all  members  are  briefed  on  current  and  forecast  weather,  NOTAMs,  and  any mission changes prior to stepping to the aircraft/GCS. 2.8.6.  Operators  will  debrief  all  missions.    The  debriefing  will  be  conducted  in  a  location with  suitable  tools  to  debrief,  at  a  minimum,  an  evaluation  of  the  mission  objectives,  test objectives, lessons learned, and execution errors.  Operators will debrief weather conditions to weather personnel when weather encountered during the mission was not as forecast. 2.8.7.  In-flight  Changes.    Do  not  fly  un-briefed  tests  and/or  events.    If  necessary,  mission elements  and  events  may  be  modified  while  the  SUAS  is  airborne  as  long  as  changes  are within scope of the approved flight test plan and do not compromise flight safety.  The Test Conductor will ensure all crewmembers understand any changes. 2.8.8.  A Go/No-Go and Operational  Risk  Management (ORM) checklist  will be completed by the Test Conductor with all crewmembers available. 2.9.  Bird  Avoidance.  Generally,  the  hour  before  and  after  sunrise  and  sunset  presents  an increased threat  of a bird strike, with  migration seasons  posing a significant  hazard at  different times.    Pilots  will  follow  locally  developed  BASH  procedures  as  well  as  those  outlined  in AFPAM  91-212,  Bird/Wildlife  Aircraft  Strike  Hazard  (BASH)  Management  Techniques  to minimize aircraft exposure to bird strikes. AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015   11  2.10.  Normal/Minimum/Low/Emergency  Landing  Fuel/Battery  Charge.  Plan to arrive into the  traffic  pattern  for  landing/recovery  at  the  intended  location  (on  initial,  normal  straight-in approach descent point, or downwind, as appropriate for aircraft type) and land with no less than the  AFI  11-502  Volume  3  required  Normal  Fuel  or  battery  reserve.    Normal,  Minimum,  and Emergency Fuel/battery capacity is defined in Attachment 1.  If it becomes apparent an aircraft will  land  with  less  than  the  required  Normal  Fuel  or  battery  charge,  SUAS-Os  shall  declare “Minimum Fuel” to the test team and with ATC and Range Control, if applicable.  If it becomes apparent an aircraft will require priority traffic routing due to a low fuel state or battery capacity, pilots shall declare “Emergency Fuel”  to the test team, ATC, and Range Control, as applicable.  CAUTION:  Consider  that  by  using  the  words,  “Emergency  Fuel”  with  ATC,  an  inflight emergency is automatically declared, taking the right-of-way over all other air traffic, impacting other  ATC-controlled  operations  in  the  vicinity,  and  activating  traditional  “crash  net”  (fire, rescue,  medical,  flight  safety)  services.    Consideration  of  hazards  created  to  others  must  be factored into a decision to use the “Emergency Fuel” term and by declaring an emergency with ATC for a SUAS system.  Preservation of the SUAS is not paramount, and crew actions must not present or create a greater hazard to other air traffic. 2.11.  Minimum  Runway  Lengths.  For  developmental  aircraft,  minimum  runway  length  will be described in the aircraft-specific safety package.   12  AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 3 MISSION GUIDANCE 3.1.  General.  This  chapter  contains  guidance  that  applies  to  all  AFMC  SUAS  operations.  SUAS  system-specific  guidance  may  be  contained  in  this  instruction‘s  attachments  where applicable.  This chapter is divided into five sub-sections: Common, Tactical and Systems, Air-to-Air, Air-to-Surface and Low Altitude, and Flight Test Missions. 3.1.1.  The test and safety review process does not have authority to grant exception to this or any other AFI. 3.2.  Common Mission Operations. 3.2.1.  Preflight 3.2.1.1.  Preflight  checklists.    All  crewmembers  will  successfully  complete  air  vehicle specific preflight checklists.  Checklists shall be included in the flight test plan. 3.2.1.2.  Engine Starts.  The engine will only be started at the command of the SUAS-O who is Lead SUAS-O for takeoff.  Engine start may be accomplished by Ground Support personnel  trained  in  the  safe  startup  of  the  engine,  being  sure  to  avoid  contact  with spinning propeller (if applicable). 3.2.2.  Launch Operations 3.2.2.1.  Catapult/Launch  System  Operations.    The  Lead  SUAS-O  for  takeoff  is responsible  to  ensure  the  area  in  front  of  the  launch  system/catapult  is  clear  of  any personnel before launch.  Hazard zones shall be identified in the test plan, appropriately marked, and briefed to  all personnel  present.   The Air Vehicle  will only  be launched at the  command  of  the  Air  Vehicle  Operator  who  is  Lead  SUAS-O  for  takeoff.    Ground Support  personnel  will  be  trained  and  certified  in  the  correct  operation  of  the  launch system,  and  all  launch  systems  will  be  operated  per  manufacturer’s  instructions  or  as outlined in the flight test plan. 3.2.2.2.  Runway  takeoffs.  The  Lead  SUAS-O  for  take-off  is  responsible  to  ensure  the runway  is  clear  for  takeoff,  is  long  enough  and  wide  enough  for  flight  operations  and clearance  of  ground  objects.    Lead  SUAS-Os  must  coordinate  with  any  ground  control personnel  in  a  multi-use  runway  environment.    Maintain  safe  taxi  speeds  at  all  times.  Crews are allowed to perform high speed taxi checks as the test mission dictates. 3.2.2.3.  Hand Launching.  Hand launching takeoff will only be accomplished by trained personnel physically capable of launching the air vehicle.  Proper care must be taken to avoid  propeller  contact  and  contact  with  hot  engine  components.    Appropriate  personal protective equipment (PPE), as determined by safety guidance or the flight manual, will be used for launch.  The Lead SUAS-O for takeoff must coordinate verbal commands for launch with the Ground Support personnel responsible for the hand launch of the vehicle. 3.2.2.4.  Accomplish  sufficient  operational  checks test  mission accomplishment.   As a  minimum,  time between operational checks will  not  exceed one hour.    Minimum  items  to  check  are  communications  links,  engine  operation,  total  fuel to  ensure  safe AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015   13  quantity  or  battery  status,  and  aircraft  position.    Checklists,  and  the  flight  test  plan including test cards, are required to be at the test site and to be followed. 3.2.3.  Flight Operations 3.2.3.1.  All  flight  operations  will  be  conducted  IAW  applicable  governing  directives, Federal  Air  Regulations  (FARs)  when  operating  within  the  United  States  (including airspace  overlying  the  waters  out  to  12  miles  from  the  US  coast  unless  the  Federal Aviation  Administration  has  excluded  military  operations),  ICAO  Standards  and Recommended  Procedures  (SARPs)    in  international  airspace  over  the  high  seas, approved  AFRL  flight  test  plans,  UAS/UAV  manufacturer  instructions,  contractor derived  operating  instructions,  FAA  Certificate  of  Authorization  (COA)  and  applicable USAF, Navy, Army, Marine Corp or DoD flight operation directives.  (T-2) 3.2.3.2.  Deviations. 3.2.3.2.1.  Mission  Aborts.  Abort  the  mission,  regardless  of  apparent  damage  or subsequent  normal  operation, for any of the following:  mid-air collision,  bird/object strike, flight control system anomalies, or failure of any engine. 3.2.3.2.2.  When  deviating  from  flight  rules  or  Air  Traffic  Control  (ATC)  instructions, a report shall be made by the test conductor to ATC or range operations before or during the event, and inform the applicable Flight Safety Office within eight hours.    Additionally,  comply  as  necessary  with  AFI  11-502  Volume  3  paragraphs 1.10 through 1.13. 3.2.3.2.3.  At  any  time,  any  crewmember  seeing  a  variation  of  200  feet  altitude,  a deviation  of  ±20  knots,  or  a  potential  safety  or  terrain  obstruction  problem  will immediately notify the SUAS-O in control of the aircraft. 3.2.3.2.4.  During  critical  phases  of  flight  (as  defined  in  the  Appendix),    SUAS-Os will  ensure  communications  are  sanitized  to  mission  essential  conversations.    The crew will alert the SUAS-O of all deviations from prescribed procedures or from the maneuver being flown.  Momentary deviations do not require corrective calls as long as immediate corrective actions are being undertaken. 3.2.4.  Landing/Recovery Operations 3.2.4.1.  Landings/Recoveries  will  be  accomplished  IAW  UAS/UAV  manufacturer instructions  and/or  flight  test  plan  guidance.    Unless  otherwise  specified  in  a  mission plan,  the  normal  procedure  is  to  bring  the  UAS  into  visual  range  for  landing/recovery.  The  Lead  SUAS-O  for  landing/recovery  is  responsible  to  ensure  the  landing/recovery zone  is  clear  of  any  personnel  before  beginning  the  approach.    Hazard  zones  shall  be identified in the test plan, appropriately marked, and briefed to all personnel present. 3.2.4.2.  Touch  and  Go  landings  are  authorized  in  AFMC,  subject  to  the  following restrictions, and SUAS-system-specific attachments.  Waivers will be submitted through AFRL/DO to AFMC/A3V IAW Para 1.3.  (T-2) 3.2.4.2.1.  Day  only  with  a  Fully  Mission  Capable  (FMC)  SUAS  having  no malfunctions or live weapons/stores.   14  AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015 3.2.4.2.2.  Authorized  for  SUAS-O  training  and  proficiency  only  (no  touch  and  go landings for non-SUAS-O personnel). 3.2.4.2.3.  A  current  and  touch  and  go  qualified  SUAS  Instructor  (SUAS-I)  must  be present  with  an  unqualified  SUAS-O  or  a  SUAS-O  must  meet  the  instructor experience requirements.  When a SUAS-I is required, the instructor will have access to an additional set of controls or be in a position to immediately intervene with the primary set of controls. 3.2.4.2.4.  Touch  and  Go  practice  and  procedures  to  be  followed  will  be  briefed during the mission briefing and before commencing touch and go landings. 3.2.4.2.5.  All engines will be used for takeoff or go-arounds. 3.2.4.2.6.  When  equipped  with  high-cost  payloads  or  unique  test  articles,  use  good judgment  in  considering  the  added  risks  in  deciding  whether  touch  and  go  landings are appropriate. 3.2.4.3.  Landings  with  a  net  or  other  arresting  recovery  system.    All  personnel  shall remain  clear  of  aircraft  recovery  systems  in  accordance  with  manufacture’s  guidelines and procedures established in approved test plans. 3.2.5.  Weather  Minimums,  Restrictions,  and  Planning  Factors.  All  flights  shall  be conducted  IAW  AFI  11-502  Vol  3  weather  minima  throughout  the  planned  route  of  flight.  The following additional sources may be utilized in determining weather conditions at non-military airfield test sites: airport control tower, regular and special weather reports obtained through  DUATS  (if  available),  Flight  Service  Station,  Military  Weather  Services  and  GCS installed weather systems.  Where possible, estimates of ceiling and visibility using obstacles or terrain features at known distances from the test site shall be used as an additional source of  information.    Maximum  crosswind  component  for  each  UAS  air  vehicle  will  not  be violated unless the maneuver is part of an approved test plan.  No SUAS flight test operations are  to  occur  during  a  thunderstorm.    Plan  and  fly  all  missions  to  avoid  areas  of  known  or forecast severe weather including severe icing or severe turbulence.  These restrictions do not apply to planned severe weather penetration with appropriate AFMC/A3V waivers as part of an  approved  test  plan.    All  flight  and  ground  operations  are  prohibited  when  lightning  is reported within five (5) NM of the test area.  All flight and ground operations are prohibited if  thunderstorms  are  producing  hazardous  conditions  such  as  hail,  strong  winds  above  30 knots, heavy rain or lightning.  (T-2) 3.2.5.1.  Category  1  and  2  UASs  receive  general  weather  support  from  authorized  weather sources.    Category  3,  and  higher,  receive  direct  weather  support  from  weather  flight personnel  or  a  servicing  Operational  Weather  Squadron  (OWS)  if  no  weather  flight  is assigned.  To determine the servicing OWS, refer to the flight information handbook (FIH) or Air  Force  Visual  Aid  (AFVA)  15-137,  Air  Force  Operational  Weather  Squadron  Areas  of Responsibility. 3.3.  Tactical and Systems Mission Operations. 3.3.1.  AFMC SUAS do not have a tactical mission or typical need for such activities such as Aerial  Refueling,  Advanced  Handling  Characteristics/Maneuvers  (AHC/AHM),  formation flying,  night  flying,  or  advanced  airborne  human  systems  integration.    If  a  research  or  test AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015   15  need  arises  to  conduct  such  activities,  procedures  for  safe  training  and  operation  shall  be outlined in the flight test plan. 3.3.2.  Functional  Check  Flights.    Conduct  of  all  SUAS  functional  check  flights  will  be  as part  of  an  approved  test  plan.    When  an  aircraft  has  original  equipment  modified  or  new equipment added that is not covered by USAF technical orders, the contractor or responsible test  organization  will  provide  FCF  or  airworthiness  verification  procedures.    The  need  for FCF after minor maintenance or modification will be determined by the aircraft maintenance activity.    For  developmental  aircraft,  the  aircraft  manufacturer  or  contractor  will  define formal FCF/Acceptance Check Flight (ACF) procedures.  (T-3) 3.3.2.1.  Use of Check Flight Cards.  Unit developed functional check flight cards may be used as part of an approved test plan. 3.3.2.2.  FCFs  will  be  conducted  in  Military  or  Special  Use  Airspace.    Waivers  to  this requirement will be submitted to the FAA (FAA COA). 3.3.2.3.  Flight  Conditions. inspections  for  FCFs  will  be accomplished during daylight hours.  Comply with any further weather minima specified in  the  specific  SUAS  operating  manual,  and  if  applicable,  SUAS  system-specific attachments to this instruction.   FCFs  and  preflight 3.3.2.4.  Combined  FCF  Flights.    FOAs  may  authorize  the  combination  of  FCFs  with other mission/training flights if the FCF is being conducted to evaluate auxiliary aircraft systems. 3.3.2.5.  Aircraft Release.  If a malfunction occurs during an FCF, which is not related to the condition or modification generating the FCF, and the original condition operationally checks  good,  the  aircraft  may  be  released  for  flight  pending  resolution  of  the  new malfunction.  This applies primarily to partial FCFs for specific modifications, and not to first-flight or post-major maintenance/overhaul FCFs. 3.3.3.  Sensor/Payload Operations.  Sensor/Payload operators are crew members who operate systems  on  the  aircraft  which  cannot  affect  the  flight  direction  or  control  of  the  aircraft. Onboard  sensors/payloads  may  be  camera  systems,  radar  systems,  electronic  intelligence (ELINT) systems, other datalink or communications systems not related to the flight control of  the  aircraft,  or  chemical/biological  sniffing  devices.    Sensor/Payload  operators  will  have proper training for the specific system under test and will operate under the supervision of a Lead  SUAS-O,  abiding  by  all  guidelines  and  restrictions  as  defined  in  this  instruction  and approved test plans. 3.3.4.  Night/NVG  operations.    Night  operations  are  not  typical  for  AFMC  SUAS  research activities.    If  a  research  or  test  need  arises  to  conduct  such  activities,  procedures  for  safe training  and  operation  shall  be  outlined  in  the  flight  test  plan.    This  section  is  reserved  for future use. 3.4.  Air to Surface Employment. 3.4.1.  Stores  Release/Weapons  Delivery.    This  chapter  describes  procedures  for  SUAS operator  air-to-surface  training  and  is  applicable  to  all  AFMC  SUAS.    Weapons  delivery training  will  be  IAW  AFI  13-212,  Volume  1,  Range  Planning  and  Operations,  and  if  they exist for the system, T.O. 1M-34, Aircraft Weapons Delivery Manual, and aircraft specific -  16  AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015 34  T.O.s.    AFI  11-214  provides  procedures  for  air-to-surface  training  for  MAJCOMs  with tactical missions.  AFMC does not have a tactical mission, but invokes AFI 11-214 for air-to-surface training.  Developmental air-to-surface testing will be conducted in accordance with test and safety review board guidance. 3.4.1.1.  Drop  Procedures.    Units  conducting  aerial  delivery  operations  will  develop specialized  training  programs  and  operational  procedures,  either  in  the  test  plan  or additional unit-published procedures if of a repetitive nature.  Submit these training plans and/or operational procedures to AFMC/A3V for review. 3.4.1.2.  Target  Identification.    Operators  must  positively  identify  the  drop  zone/target and  ensure  correlation  with    guidance  and  targeting  systems  prior  to  stores/weapons release.  For  example, a pilot  may visually identify  a target,  but  must ensure the sensor controlling the point of impact (targeting pod, radar, etc.) will direct the store/weapon to the  identified  area/target.    When  delivering  stores/weapons  via  an  INS  and/or  GPS solution  without  visual  identification  of  the  target  (through  a  cloud  deck,  in  IMC,  at night,  etc.),  target  identification  and  correlation  is  defined  as  verifying  the  target coordinates and navigation solution respectively, while airborne. 3.4.1.3.  Air-to-Surface  Operations.  AFMC  SUAS  operators  will  not  conduct  simulated or  actual  weapons  employment  without  completing  an  AFMC/A3V  approved  weapons employment training plan.  SUAS operators will not control more than one SUAS while employing ordnance, both simulated and live. 3.4.1.4.  Minimum  Altitudes.    Comply  with  restrictions  and  minimum  release  and recovery altitudes as specified in the specific SUAS operating manual and approved test plan. 3.4.1.5.  Flight  Composition.    Dissimilar  aircraft  may  execute  deliveries  on  the  same range provided the delivery events are compatible with each type of aircraft and AFI 11-214 delivery spacing restrictions are followed. 3.4.1.6.  Live Ordnance Procedures. 3.4.1.6.1.  Conduct a thorough and complete verification of all target data. 3.4.1.6.2.  No release system, indicator, or weapon bay door malfunction may exist. 3.4.1.6.3.  Weapon Unlock/Release Enable/Master Arm to Arm will not be completed until the aircraft is within the designated bombing range. 3.4.1.6.4.  If  all  weapons  are  expended  and  release  is  verified  visually  (pilot observation of impact, by the Range Control Office (RCO), or other flight members) and  internal  indications  are  consistent  with  outside  observations,  SUAS  operators may conduct additional training without restriction. 3.4.1.6.5.  Do  not  make  simulated  weapon  delivery  passes  on  targets  occupied  by personnel unless approved by the SUAS unit commander.  Simulated weapon attacks with live ordnance is prohibited. 3.4.1.7.  Class B/C Ranges.  When Ground Controllers are operating on Class B/C ranges the following procedures apply: AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015   17  3.4.1.7.1.  All  SUAS-Operators  will  be  familiar  with  applicable  range  weapons delivery procedures, appropriate targets and weapons footprints. 3.4.1.7.2.  Ground  personnel  locations  will  be  briefed  and  acknowledged  by  all operators. 3.4.1.7.3.  Operators  will  not  expend  ordnance  if  any  doubt  exists  as  to  the  ground personnel or intended target locations. 3.4.1.8.  Battle  Damage/Bomb  Checks.  Unless  circumstances  prevent,  SUAS-Os  will direct a battle damage/bomb check prior to or during return to base (RTB).  This visual check is mandatory following the expenditure of live ordnance (including all types of gun ammunition).  Ground observers may accomplish  these checks, if required.  This  check may be accomplished using on-board sensors if applicable. 3.4.1.9.  Armament  System  Malfunctions.    Operators  will  not  attempt  to  expend stores/ordnance  using  a  delivery  system  with  a  known  stores/weapons  release malfunction, unless following hung store/ordnance procedures. 3.4.1.10.  Inadvertent Release. Record switch positions and impact point (if known) at the time  of  inadvertent  release  and  provide  to  armament  and  safety  personnel.    Check armament switches safe and do not attempt further release in any mode.  Treat remaining stores as hung ordnance and obtain a chase aircraft during RTB, if practical.  If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison in a suitable area on a single pass, if practical. 3.4.1.11.  Hung Store/Ordnance. Crews experiencing a hung store may contact the RCO for  permission  to  release  or  jettison  the  hung  stores  in  a  suitable  area.    If  a  hung  store cannot  be  jettisoned  or  released,  or  if  the  crew  elects  not  to  jettison,  the  crew  will accomplish  any  required  checklists  and  recover  to  the  most  appropriate  location  while avoiding over-flight of populated areas. 3.4.1.11.1.  Refer  to  local  guidance  for  recovery  procedures  with  hung  weapons.    If the  crew  is  required  to  land  the  SUAS  with  hung  or  unexpended  weapons,  at  a location other than the planned base of operations advise the local authorities of the situation so that proper coordination can be accomplished with their safety office. 3.4.1.12.  On-Range No Radio (NORDO) Procedures. 3.4.1.12.1.  Attempt contact with the RCO on the appropriate back-up frequency, via telephone, or dedicated network chat.  The method used must be pre-coordinated and briefed with the RCO.  If unable to establish contact, make a pass by the range control tower  (over  the  target  if  flying  on  an  unmanned  range)  on  the  attack  heading  while rocking wings, and turn in the direction of traffic.  Use of cell phones to re-establish team contact with the controlling agency/RCO may be acceptable if compatible with EMI and range restrictions. 3.4.1.12.2.  If the NORDO aircraft has an emergency, and conditions permit, make a pass  by  the  range  control  tower,  on  the  attack  heading  while  rocking  wings,  turn opposite the direction of traffic, and proceed to a suitable recovery base. 3.4.1.12.3.  Unexpended  Ordnance.    If  radio  failure  occurs  and  circumstances preclude  landing  with  unexpended  ordnance,  accomplish  a  safe  jettison  of  the ordnance.   18  AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015 3.4.1.12.4.  Lost Link Procedures with Ordnance: 3.4.1.12.4.1.  The  Lead  SUAS-O  must  ensure  prior  to  the  flight  that  lost  link routing  and  profiles  are  compatible  with  a  hung  store  situation,  and  remain  on range and clear of populated areas. 3.4.1.12.4.2.  If  the  SUAS  lost  link  procedures  allow  the  UA  to  perform  an autonomous  landing,  SUAS  operators  must  make  special  provisions  for  clearing the runway/landing zone prior to return of a UA with unexpended ordnance on all missions with weapons loaded. 3.4.2.  Low  Level  Procedures.    Developmental  testing  in  the  low  level  structure  will  be conducted in accordance with test and safety review board guidance. 3.4.2.1.  Minimum  Altitudes.    Comply  with  restrictions  and  minimum  altitudes  as specified in the specific SUAS operating manual and approved test plan. 3.5.  Air-to-Air Employment.  This section is reserved for future use. 3.6.  Flight Test Mission Guidance. 3.6.1.  Flight  Test  Orientation.    MDS  specific  guidance  is  provided  in  this  instruction’s attachments where required. 3.6.2.  Target.    Target  operations  refer  to  direct  support  missions  that  do  not  involve  chase events.   A chase qualification is  not  required to  fly target  events.    In the  absence of test  or safety review board restrictions follow AFI 11-214 air-to-air guidance. 3.6.3.  Chase.    If  manned  Chase  aircraft  are  required,  see  published  procedures  in  AFI  11-2FT Volume 3. 3.6.4.  Stores  Release  Testing.    All  weapons  delivery  guidance  applies.    Group  specific guidance is provided in this instruction’s attachments where required. AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015   19  Chapter 4 INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES 4.1.  Instrument  Flight  Rules.  Current  fielded  Small  UAS  and  SUAS-Os  have  neither  the equipment nor training and certifications required to comply with procedures for operation under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).  Future systems intended to test/certify IFR capabilities must be preceded with developed and approved training programs.   20  AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 5 OPERATING PROCEDURES AND RESTRICTIONS 5.1.  General.  These  procedures  do  not  supersede  flight  manual  guidance.    Refer  to  SUAS Group attachments for additional aircraft specific operational limits and restrictions. 5.2.  Technical Orders.  With the exception of authorized flight test missions, personnel will not operate new equipment or modified aircraft without properly validated and verified tech data in accordance with 00-5 series T.O.s.  Once validated by flight test, new equipment can be operated using  test  cards  derived  from  an  approved  test  plan  if  other  tech  data  does  not  yet  exist.  Modified aircraft will be operated in accordance with the aircraft modification flight manual.  (T-2) 5.3.  Developmental  Software.  The  aircraft  chief  of  engineering  or  aircraft  System  Program Manager  (SPM)  must  certify  developmental  software,  including  mission  planning  software  for flight  outside  a test program.   This  certification  may  be delegated in  writing to  the responsible FOA  with  delegated  oversight  responsibility  for  programs  not  governed  by  SPMs.    Under  no circumstances will a flight outside of an approved test plan take place with software that has not passed a safety of flight evaluation. 5.4.  New/Modified Aircraft Equipment/Weapons.  SUAS-Os not qualified in the operation of new or modified aircraft equipment are restricted in operator duties.  They will not operate that equipment on any flight unless under the supervision of a current and qualified instructor of like specialty  qualified  in  that  equipment.    This  restriction  does  not  apply  to  aircraft  and  SUAS operators under a formal test plan who have completed the necessary training. 5.5.  Aerial  Demonstration/Show  Formation.  Refer  to  AFI  11-209,  Aerial  Event  Policy  and Procedures,  AFI  11-246,  Air  Force  Aircraft  Demonstrations,  and  applicable  MAJCOM directives for specific  rules and appropriate approval  levels  to  participate in  static displays and aerial events. 5.6.  Flight  Duty  Period  (FDP).  SUAS  flight  duty  period  restrictions  are  IAW  AFI  11-502 Volume 3 and AFMC Sup 1. 5.7.  Checklists.  Notes  amplifying  checklist  procedures  or  limitations  may  be  added  to  the checklists.  Checklist items that do not apply to the unit’s aircraft or mission may be lined out. 5.8.  Takeoff Aborts.  Prior to flight, the Lead-SUAS will ensure that every member of the flight has  reviewed  and  understands  takeoff  data.    Place  particular  emphasis  on  takeoff  and  abort factors  during  abnormal  situations  such  as  short  or  wet  runway  operations,  and  heavy  gross weights.  Anytime an aircraft experiences a high speed abort, hot brakes should be suspected (if applicable).  If confirmed, declare a ground emergency and taxi the aircraft to the designated hot brake area and perform hot brake procedures if necessary and applicable. 5.9.  Standard  Transfer  of  Aircraft  Control  (Handoffs/Handovers).  Both  SUAS-Os  of aircraft  utilizing  more  than  one  operator  must  communicate  and  know  at  all  times  who  has control  of  the  aircraft.    When  ready,  the  relinquishing  SUAS-O  will  initiate  transfer  with  the positive  verbal  statement  “You  take  the  aircraft  (controls).”  The  SUAS-O  receiving  control  of the  aircraft  will  acknowledge  “I  have  the  aircraft  (controls).”    This  standard  also  applies  to unplanned  transfers  such  as  an  instructor  taking  control,  or  during  an  emergency.    Once AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015   21  assuming control of the aircraft, maintain control until relinquishing it as stated above.  If inter-operator  communication  (intercom,  radio,  etc.)  fails,  the  Lead  SUAS-O  for  that  portion  of  the flight will assume control of the aircraft, and indicate such by a pre-briefed nonverbally apparent signal,  such  as  rocking  the  wings.    Non-standard  terminology  or  procedures  for  transfer  of aircraft control may be briefed as long as the methodology clearly distinguishes positive transfer of control from other actions such as ‘having” the aircraft visually. 5.10.  Unusual Attitudes and Training Maneuvers (non-aerobatic).  Practice unusual attitude recoveries are prohibited at night, in IMC, with simulated/live weapons/stores, and any time the safety observer is not qualified in the aircraft.  These maneuvers will only be accomplished when defined and required in  an approved test plan.  Initiate unusual  attitude recoveries at  an altitude that will allow safe recovery of the SUAS. Minimum unusual attitude altitudes will be published in  the  Group-specific  attachments  to  this  publication.    Abrupt  training  maneuvers  including intentional  maneuvers  involving  an  abrupt  change  in  aircraft  attitude,  abnormal  attitude,  or abnormal  accelerations or decelerations not  necessary for normal  flight  are subject  to  the same restrictions. 5.11.  Simulated  Emergencies.  Do  not  practice  emergency  procedures  that  degrade  aircraft performance or flight control capabilities unless specifically authorized by an approved training syllabus  or  test  plan.    In  addition  to  the  restrictions  in  AFI  11-502  Volume  3,  the  following restrictions apply:  (T-2) 5.11.1.  Ensure  that  specific  pattern  procedures  for  conduct  of  emergency  training  do  not conflict  with  other  flight  patterns  of  other  aircraft.    If  necessary  to  deconflict,  coordinate letters of agreement (LOA) in advance with appropriate agencies and publish procedures in appropriate local publications.  A simulated emergency will not be initiated or continued if a potential traffic pattern conflict exists which would require that the SUAS-O divide attention between  practicing  the  emergency  procedure  and  sequencing  with  traffic.    In  addition, simulated  emergencies  will  be  discontinued  whenever  excessive  maneuvering  is  required, whether as a result of a traffic conflict or when making corrections. 5.11.2.  During initial qualification or re-qualification sorties, the IP or EP will be at a second set of controls and in a position to direct a go-around, and/or take control, if needed. 5.11.3.  Day VMC only. 5.11.4.  Gross weight must not exceed basic weight plus weight of full internal fuel or flight manual limits, whichever is less. 5.11.5.  No external ordnance, except training ordnance, may be carried. 5.11.6.  Before  initiating  any  simulated  emergency,  the  Lead  SUAS-O/IP/EP  will  brief  the operations team on the condition to be simulated, and state “Simulated” over the intra-team communication  system  prior the  simulated  condition,  and  during accomplishment  of  each  simulated  emergency  procedure.    For  all  simulated  emergency patterns, ensure radio transmissions to ATC comply with local procedures. to  establishing 5.11.7.  Simulated  Engine  Out  patterns.    The  engine-out  pattern  may  be  entered  from  any direction or altitude that will ensure the aircraft is properly configured prior to base key and in  a  position  to  safely  complete  the  approach.    On  glow  or  carbureted  engines,  avoid extended  time  at  idle  power  settings  by  performing  occasional  engine  clearing  throttle-ups.    22  AFI11-5FTV3  27 AUGUST 2015 Full stop and touch-and-go landings may be flown by fully qualified SUAS-Os or by students under  the  direct  supervision  of  a  SUAS-Instructor/Evaluator,    provided  the  approach  is stabilized and the aircraft will land in the recommended touchdown zone.  The aircraft must rollout wings level within a safe altitude above ground on final.  Minimum airspeed during an  engine-out  traffic  pattern  is  stall  speed  plus  10  knots  KIAS.    Terminate  the  engine-out pattern if airspeed decreases below the minimum stated or NLT 50 ft AGL if the aircraft will land short of the intended point of landing.  If these parameters are not met, a go-around will immediately  be  performed.    All  engines  will  be  used  for  unplanned  go-around.    Simulated Engine-Out climbout is not authorized (multi-engine aircraft).  Once discontinued, and a go-around is initiated, no attempt will be made to re-enter or complete that pattern/approach. 5.12.  Fuel  Jettisoning/Dumping.  Fuel  jettisoning  will  be  conducted  only  to  reduce  aircraft gross  weight  in  an  emergency,  for  operational  necessity,  or  as  required  for  flight  test  or  FCF.  When  circumstances  permit,  jettison  fuel  over  unpopulated  areas  at  an  altitude  above  5,000 AGL, when feasible.  Advise the appropriate air traffic control agency of intention, altitude, and location when fuel is jettisoned and when the operation has been completed.  Units will establish jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of fuel jettisoning into the atmosphere.  Use designated jettison areas and local area procedures to the maximum extent possible, except when safety  of  flight  would  be  compromised.    Refer  to  specific  SUAS  Group  attachments  for additional guidance, if applicable. 5.13.  Dropped  Objects.  If  an  object  inadvertently  departs  the  aircraft,  the  flight  crew  will notify the controlling agency as soon as practical; include details of routing, altitude, winds aloft, etc.  After landing, notify maintenance and initiate appropriate safety processes. 5.14.  Hazardous  Conditions.  Relay  any  safety  hazard  (e.g.  icing,  turbulence,  thunderstorms, bird concentrations etc.), through a Pilot Weather Report (PIREP) to the controlling agency.  SCOTT A.
