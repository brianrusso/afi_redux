Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  Surety  Standards.  The  DoD  Nuclear  Weapon  System Surety Standards form the basis for the safety design and evaluation criteria for nuclear weapon systems.  The DoD Nuclear Weapon System Surety Standards state that: 1.1.1.  There shall be positive measures to prevent nuclear weapons involved in accidents or incidents or jettisoned weapons, from producing a nuclear yield. 1.1.2.  There  shall  be  positive  measures  to  prevent  DELIBERATE  prearming,  arming, launching or releasing of nuclear weapons, except upon execution of emergency war orders or when directed by competent authority. 1.1.3.  There  shall  be  positive  measures  to  prevent  INADVERTENT  prearming,  arming, launching or releasing of nuclear weapons in all normal and credible abnormal environments. 1.1.4.  There  shall  be  positive  measures  to  ensure  adequate  security  of  nuclear  weapons,  as governed by DoDD 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons. 1.2.  Air  Force  Criteria.  To comply with the DoD nuclear surety standards, the Air Force has implemented a set of minimum design and evaluation criteria for their nuclear weapon systems.  Criteria  contained  in  this  manual  implement  AFI  91-101,  Air  Force  Nuclear  Weapons  Surety Program,  and  DoD  nuclear  surety  standards.    These  criteria  do  not  invalidate  the  safety requirements in other DoD publications.  Air Force activities must apply whichever criteria are most stringent.  Since the criteria in this manual are not design solutions and are not intended to restrict the designer in the methods and techniques used to meet operational design requirements, they  are  not  all-inclusive.    Air  Force  nuclear  weapon  system  designers  may  add  feasible  and reasonable safety features as needed.  Refer to AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program, for details  on  the  nuclear  certification  procedures.    AFI  91-103,  Air  Force  Nuclear  Safety  Design Certification Program, provides details on what is required to be nuclear safety design certified, while AFMAN 91-118 provides the design and evaluation criteria for those items required to be nuclear safety design certified. Section 1B—Deviations to Criteria. 1.3.  Deviations.  If  the  design  of  an  Air  Force  nuclear  weapon  system  does  not  meet  the requirements  contained  in  this  manual,  a  deviation  request  shall  be  obtained  according  to  the requirements  of  AFI  91-101,  Chapter  3.    Exceptions  to  this  manual,  as  evidenced  by  some current and older designs, do not constitute a precedent to deviate from the criteria. 1.4.  Currency  of  Standards  and  Guidance.  Standards  and  guidance  referenced  in  this document are current as of the date of publication.  In the event of cancellation or modification of the referenced standards or guidance, contact AFSEC/SEWN for requirements. 1.5.  Existing Systems.  Existing systems are not required to be modified solely to meet new or changed  requirements  in  this  manual.    If  an  existing  system  is  modified,  the  modified  system shall  meet  new  requirements  established  through  guidance  or  standards  as  necessary  per  this   8  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 AFMAN  and  applicable  91-series  instructions.    If  the  design  of  a  modified  system  is  not expected to meet the requirements in this Manual, a deviation shall be obtained per AFI 91-101, Chapter 3. AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   9  Chapter 2 DESIGN CRITERIA FOR NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEMS Section 2A—General Philosophy and Criteria. 2.1.  Nuclear  Weapon  Safety  Design  Philosophy.  The  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  designs nuclear  weapon  safety  devices  to  withstand  credible  abnormal  environments  until  the  weapons critical  arming  components  are  inoperative  or  until  the  weapon  is  physically  incapable  of providing a nuclear detonation.  The design of Air Force nuclear weapon systems shall consider these DOE nuclear weapon safety design concepts: 2.1.1.  Exclusion Region.  This region contains the firing set and weapon detonator system.  It also has the necessary packaging and safety devices to exclude functional energy, for other than intended use, from the firing set and weapon detonator system. 2.1.2.  Strong  Links.    Strong  Links  are  safety  devices,  such  as  system  prearm  devices  and environmental or trajectory sensing devices, that permit the transmission of functional energy to  the  firing  set  for  the  arming  and  firing  signals  (following  the  receipt  of  the  appropriate unique  signal  information  sequence  at  the  appropriate  time)  and  provide  threat  energy isolation in an abnormal environment.  Functional energy includes the proper energy type(s) and level(s), which are required to achieve the intended functional operation of the weapon (i.e., significant nuclear yield).  Threat energy encompasses unintended temporal patterns of energy  type(s)  and  level(s)  that  can  lead  to  an  unintended  state  of  the  weapon  up  to  and including unintentional significant nuclear yield. 2.1.3.  Weak  Links.    A  weak  link  is  a  selected  functional  unit  (such  as  a  capacitor  or transformer)  vital  to  operating  the  firing  set  and  weapon  detonator  system  and  whose function is not likely to be duplicated or bypassed.  Weak links respond predictably to certain levels  and  types  of  abnormal  environments  by  becoming  irreversibly  inoperable  and  thus rendering the system inoperable at levels less than those at which the strong links fail to keep energy isolation.  Weak links and strong links are collocated so as to experience essentially the same environment at the same time. 2.2.  Nuclear  Weapon  System  Safety  Design  Philosophy.  The guidance in this chapter is for use by Air Force and Air Force contracted designers and evaluators.  Air Force nuclear weapon system  designs  implement  critical  function  control  to  provide  adequate  protection  against premature detonation of a nuclear weapon in both normal and credible abnormal environments. 2.2.1.  Critical  Function  Control  Concepts.    Criteria  for  adequately  controlling    critical functions depend on the specific nuclear safety design concept of the weapon system.  Older nuclear  weapons  and  weapon  systems  use  the  energy  control  (or  removal)  concept  or  the information  control concept.  Many currently deployed systems use the information control concept or a combination of both concepts. 2.2.1.1.  Energy Control Concept.  The energy control concept involves limiting the entry of threat energy into the weapon system devices that control the operation of the critical functions.    Critical  functions  are  designed  to  require  functional  energy  signal(s)  for operation.    Reliability  requires  that  the  weapon  system  respond  as  intended  when  the functional energy signal(s) are present at the weapon interface.  Therefore, safety levels   10  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 (IAW  AFI  91-107)  of  weapon  systems  using  this  design  concept  depend  on  the  safety controls  that  block  application  of  those  functional  energy  signal(s)  to  the  weapon interface until the controls are properly removed. 2.2.1.2.  Information  Control  Concept.    Critical  prearm  functions  are  commanded  by  a unique  signal  that  provides  indication  of  an  unambiguous  human  intent  to  detonate  the weapon.  Safety levels depend upon the uniqueness of a carefully designed sequence of bi-valued events and are evaluated based on the assumptions of worst-case power levels.  Worst-case power levels involve temporal patterns of energy type(s) and level(s) needed to transmit bi-valued events which can be discriminated by the strong link and can lead to an unintended establishment of the transmission path through the strong link barrier that allows passage of either functional or threat energy. 2.2.2.  Critical Functions.  These functions are critical: 2.2.2.1.  Authorization.    The  weapon  system  shall  have  one  or  more  devices  to  control authorization  to  use  the  weapon.    These  devices  shall  prevent  prearming  or  arming  (or both)  of  a  nuclear  bomb  or  warhead  in  aircraft-carried  weapons  and  the  launch  of  a ground-launched  missile  until  authorization  to  prepare  to  use  the  weapon  is  received through  the  command  and  control  system.    Examples  of  these  controls  are  the  enable device in the Minuteman weapon system and the permissive action link (PAL) in many nuclear bombs. 2.2.2.1.1.  The  authorization  device,  which  meets  the  numerical  requirements specified in AFI 91-107, for protection against unauthorized actions, shall operate on the  information  control  concept.    A  secure  method  shall  provide  the  information through command and control channels. 2.2.2.1.2.  The  system  shall  have  built-in  positive  design  features  to  prevent inadvertent  operation  of  the  data  entry  control.    The  positive  features  shall  protect against inadvertent operation of the authorization device and an attack on or bypass of the device.  The system design shall reveal any attack on or bypass of the device.  If remotely  monitored,  the  weapon  system  operators  or  control  point  shall  receive  an attack or bypass indication.  The indication (local, remote or local and remote) shall be  latching  (remains  actuated  until  reset  by  authorized  personnel)  and  shall  be protected from the attacker to prevent reset. 2.2.2.1.3.  The authorization device shall not prevent any safing or relocking function, regardless of the state of the authorization device. 2.2.2.2.  Prearming.    The  prearm  command  provides  an  unambiguous  indication  of human  intent  to  the  weapon  that  the  weapon  system  operators  want  it  to  function  as designed  and  produce  a  nuclear  detonation.    Once  commanded  to  the  prearm  state  and presented with proper arming stimuli, the weapon shall arm.  The weapon system design shall  keep  the  prearming  function  separate  and  independent  from  the  authorization function.  Weapon design features shall preclude prearming in the absence of the prearm command signal  and prevent bypass of any prearming  device that would permit arming without prearming. 2.2.2.2.1.  For weapons whose design is based on the information control concept, use uniquely  coded  prearm  command  signals.    The  information  needed  to  generate  the AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   11  unique  signal  shall  be  physically  unavailable  to  the  unique  signal  generator  until  its use is required. 2.2.2.2.2.  For  weapons  whose  design  is  based  on  the  energy  control  concept, physically  and  electrically  isolate  the  prearm  command  signal  line  from  all  other circuits.    Avoid  the  use  of  common  routing,  cabling,  or  connectors  with  the  prearm command signal line and any wire likely to carry enough power to operate the prearm device.  Give special design consideration to credible abnormal environments. 2.2.2.3.  Launching.  Operation of a rocket motor propulsion system (control of launch) is controlled through two independent functions: the ignition system arm or safe command and  the  ignition  command.    The  weapon  system  shall  have  a  safe  and  arm  device  or equivalent design to protect the ignition system.  Without the arm command, propulsion system  ignition  shall  not  occur  even  if  the  ignition  command  is  sent.    Design  features shall preclude accidental or deliberate unauthorized transmission of the arm and ignition commands.    The  design  shall  also  prevent  any  failure  from  allowing  bypass  of  the ignition safing device that would permit ignition when the device is safed. 2.2.2.4.  Releasing.    Operation  of  the  release  system  for  aircraft-carried  weapons  is controlled  through  two  independent  functions:  the  release  system  unlock  command  and the release command.  Without the unlock command, separation of the weapon from the combat  delivery  aircraft  shall  not  occur  even  if  the  release  command  is  sent.    Design features shall preclude accidental transmission of unlock and release commands and shall also  prevent  any  failure  from  allowing  bypass  of  the  lock  device  that  would  permit release  of  the  weapon  when  the  device  is  locked.    Aircraft  delivery  system  controls  for release  of  guided  weapons  shall  provide  for  the  protection  of  friendly  territory  to  the greatest  extent  possible  (i.e.,  combination  of  system  design  features  and  procedural controls).    For  air-launched  missiles,  the  ignition  system  arm  and  the  release  system unlock shall be separate and independent functions. 2.2.2.5.  Arming.  If the weapon is prearmed, arming shall be the design response of the weapon  to  sensing  that  the  environment  is  within  the  limits  defined  for  operational  use (after launch or release).  Design features shall include measurements of the environment so environments other than "intended use" are discriminated against to the greatest extent possible.  If a missile has self-contained guidance, include a good guidance signal (refer to  paragraph  2.9.1.1)  as  a  measurement  of  the  proper  operational  environment.    Guided bombs  shall  include  a  good  guidance  signal  prior  to  release  as  a  measurement  of  the proper operational environment.  Guided bombs released from aircraft shall also include a  good  guidance  signal  (refer  to  paragraph  2.9.1.2)  as  a  measurement  of  the  proper operational  environment.    The  armed  condition  allows  the  selected  fuze  signal  (such  as radar, contact or timer) to detonate the warhead.  Design features shall preclude arming unless  the  proper  operational  environment  is  sensed;  prevent  erroneous  transmission  of the  good  guidance  signal;  and  preclude  bypass  of  the  arming  system  that  would  permit nuclear detonation of the warhead without arming. 2.2.2.6.  Targeting.    Targeting  is  a  critical  function  for  ground-launched  missiles.    It includes  the  preparation  and  weapon  system  processing  of  targeting  data,  and  the transmission to missile guidance, arming and fuzing systems.  Targeting data consists of the flight control and fuzing constants needed to deliver and detonate the weapon within   12  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 the designated target area.  The weapon system design shall prevent erroneous targeting functions and accidental or unauthorized changes to targeting data. 2.2.3.  Reversible Operations.  Ensure the operation of devices for authorization, prearming, propulsion system ignition arming and aircraft release system unlocking is reversible. 2.2.4.  Targeting  for  air-delivered  systems.    Targeting  is  not  a  critical  function  for  air-delivered systems.  However, air-delivered missiles or bombs with guidance require positive measures  (as  defined  in  AFI  91-101)  to  ensure  the  protection  of  friendly  territory  to  the greatest extent possible (refer to paragraphs 2.9.1 and 2.9.2). 2.3.  Critical  Function  Numerical  Requirements.  The  numerical  requirements  specified  in AFI 91-107 apply to ground-launched missile and combat delivery aircraft systems to show that, in  normal  environments,  the  calculated  probability  of  occurrence  of  inadvertent  prearming, launching, releasing or jettisoning, arming or erroneous targeting of nuclear weapons is unlikely to  occur  during  the  system  lifetime.    Although  numerical  specifications  for  credible  abnormal environments are only defined for DOE nuclear bombs and warheads, Air Force nuclear weapon system designers shall incorporate positive safety features for these environments into the design of combat delivery vehicles to protect against inadvertent critical function activation. 2.4.  Safety  Features  and  Procedures.  Ensure  the  nuclear  safety  design  features  eliminate  or minimize the dependence on administrative procedures for safety and security. 2.5.  Explosive  Ordnance  Disposal.  Design  aircraft  and  missile  systems  to  permit  emergency access to those components and circuits required to carry out render-safe procedures.  Develop render-safe procedures with the intent of meeting the numerical requirements of AFI 91-107. 2.6.  Physical and Internal Security.  A physical security system shall prevent access to nuclear weapons  and  protect  nuclear  weapon  system  equipment  and  secure  data  (refer  to  paragraph 1.1.4).  Nuclear weapon systems and nuclear weapons shall incorporate internal security features to prevent unauthorized use (refer to paragraph 1.1.2). 2.7.  Environmental Parameters.  Consider nuclear safety design features over the full range of normal  and  credible  abnormal  environments  to  which  the  system  could  be  subjected.    Since specific  normal  and  abnormal  environmental  parameters  are  system  dependent,  use  the parameters specified in the appropriate nuclear bomb and warhead Stockpile-to-Target Sequence (STS) and Military Characteristics documents and in the weapon system specifications. 2.8.  Safe  and  Arm  (S&A)  and  Arm/Disarm  (A/D)  Devices.  Ensure  these  devices  meet  the design criteria in MIL-HDBK-1512, Electro-explosive Subsystems, Electrically Initiated, Design Requirements and Test Methods.  If the devices are electrically actuated, they shall arm only in response to an externally generated unique signal.  The safing signal shall differ from the arming signal to reduce the risk of arming during attempted safing.  If a monitor signal is used, it shall also be different from the arming signal. 2.9.  Protection of Friendly Territory.  Design weapon systems to prevent nuclear detonations, except within specified target boundaries. 2.9.1.  Good Guidance Signal: 2.9.1.1.  Missile systems and guided missiles launched from aircraft shall receive a good guidance  signal  from  the  guidance  and  control  unit  before  nuclear  warhead  arming  can AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   13  occur.    The  good  guidance  signal  shall  be  withheld  if  a  final  guidance  accuracy  check shows the weapon shall impact outside specified target boundaries. 2.9.1.2.  Guided bombs shall incorporate a good guidance signal prior to release and shall also incorporate a good guidance signal for arming which shall be withheld if the weapon cannot be guided to detonate within specified target boundaries. 2.9.2.  Target  Boundaries.    The  boundaries  for  airborne  release  and  delivery  systems  vary with the number of weapons, weapon yield and type, methods of use, geographical location and  operational  needs.    Consequently,  the  DoD  weapon  system  program  managers,  with coordination  from  the  operating  command  and  the  appropriate  nuclear  safety  evaluation agency, shall specify target boundaries. 2.10.  Single Component Failure or Operation.  Ensure the failure or accidental operation of a single  component  does  not  result  in  authorization  to  use  a  nuclear  weapon  system;  prearming, launching,  or  releasing  of  a  nuclear  weapon;  or  arming  of  a  prearmed  weapon.    This  criterion applies  before  any  of  these  functions  are initiated  or  when  more  than  one  event remains  in  the operational sequence leading to a function initiation. 2.11.  Human  Engineering.  Design  the  system  so  no  two  independent  human  errors  or  acts shall  cause  prearming,  arming,  launching  or  releasing  of  a  nuclear  weapon  in  an  operational weapon  system  or  shall  authorize  the  use  of  a  ground-launched  missile  system.    This  criterion applies only before initiation of actions required to complete the desired operation.  The design shall  minimize  the  number  of  points  within  the  system  where  human  actions  could  degrade nuclear  safety  or  security.    The  design  shall  also  stress  positive  measures  to  prevent  deliberate unauthorized or accidental operation of controls that could degrade nuclear safety or security. 2.12.  Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Equipment. 2.12.1.  Non-specialized COTS.   Non-specialized COTS equipment is  nuclear safety  design certified  as  prescribed  in  AFI  91-103,  Air  Force  Nuclear  Safety  Design  Certification Program. 2.12.2.  Integrated COTS Equipment/Item.  COTS items that are used or integrated as part of an item that requires nuclear safety design certification as defined in AFI 91-103 (e.g., multi-meters  integrated  as  part  of  a  certified  tester,  etc.)  are  considered  specialized  and  shall  be evaluated in accordance with this manual. Section 2B—Automata, Software, Firmware, Integrated Circuits and Hardware. 2.13.  General  Design  Criteria.  All  software,  including  software  used  to  generate  automata, firmware  and  integrated  circuits,  that  receives,  stores,  processes  or  transmits  data  to  monitor, target, prearm, arm, launch, release or authorize the use of a nuclear weapon shall comply with the  design  and  evaluation  criteria  specified  in  AFMAN  91-119,  Safety  Design  and  Evaluation Criteria  for  Nuclear  Weapon  Systems  Software.  This  also  includes  software  used  to  generate automata,  firmware  and  integrated  circuits  that  receive,  store,  process  or  transmit  data  to monitor,  target,  prearm,  arm,  launch,  release  or  authorize  the  use  of  a  nuclear  weapon.  An example of an integrated circuit being generated using software  is the use  of Very-High-Speed Integrated  Circuits  (VHSIC)  Hardware  Description  Language  (VHDL)  to  design,  simulate  and synthesize an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)   14  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 2.13.1.  Circuitry  Designed  with  Automated  Tools.    Critical  circuitry  designed  with automated tools (e.g. synthesized from VHDL) shall be verified IAW AFMAN 91-119. 2.13.2.  Reprogrammable  Circuitry.   Reprogrammable  circuitry  (e.g. the  contents  of  a  Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)) shall be protected IAW AFMAN 91-119. 2.13.3.  Circuits  with  Embedded  Software.    Critical  circuits  with  embedded  software  or firmware are subject to AFMAN 91-119. 2.13.4.  Electronic  Circuits  Controlling  Critical  Signals  or  Performing  Critical  Functions.  The  integrity  of  critical  functions  implemented  with  electronic  circuits  must  be  protected IAW AFMAN 91-119. 2.13.5.  Programmable Logic Devices.  Critical circuitry incorporating FPGA’s or other logic devices subject to a single event upset shall employ redundancy or other discipline to protect the integrity of the critical function for all credible environments.  Reliability goals specified in AFI 91-107 are sufficient for systems incorporating programmable logic devices. Section 2C—Electrical Subsystems and Hazards. 2.14.  General  Design  Criteria.  A  major  part  of  a  nuclear  weapon  system  is  composed  of electrical  subsystems  designed  to  monitor, target,  prearm,  arm,  launch,  release  or  authorize  the use  of  nuclear  weapons.    Design  these  subsystems  to  preclude  accidental  operation,  single component failure or electrical disturbance from performing or degrading critical functions. 2.14.1.  Electromagnetic Interference (EMI).  Design all electronic and electrical subsystems or  equipment  within  or  associated  with  nuclear  weapon  systems  to  minimize  undesired responses  and  emissions  (refer  to  MIL-STD-461,  Requirements  for  the  Control  of Electromagnetic  Interference  Characteristics  of  Subsystems  and  Equipment  and  MIL-STD-464,  Electromagnetic  Environmental  Effects  Requirements  for  Systems).    The  design  of wires, switches, cable connectors, junction points and other system elements shall minimize undesirable radiated and conducted interference or transients when such EMI could cause a nuclear hazard or ordnance ignition. 2.14.2.  Isolation.  In general, electrically isolate any critical circuit, either power or control, from  other  critical  and  noncritical  circuits  (consider  signals  transmitted  on  either  time-  or frequency- domain multiplexed transmission lines to be electrically isolated).  The purpose of this  requirement  is  to  prevent  faults  or  common  mode  malfunctions  from  operating  critical circuits  or  explosive  components  in  all  environments.    These  requirements  apply  to  all nuclear weapon systems: 2.14.2.1.  Do  not  use  wire  or  cable  shields  as  current-carrying  conductors  and  cover shields with an insulation layer. 2.14.2.2.  Ensure  electro-explosive  circuitry,  which  affects  or  is  affected  by  critical functions, conforms to MIL-HDBK-1512. 2.14.2.3.  Within  the  weapon  interface  control  units,  use  crush-resistant  shielded compartments and separate wiring bundles to isolate critical function circuits from power, noncritical circuits and other critical circuits. AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   15  2.14.2.4.  For  hardwire  systems,  ensure  electrical  functions  unique  to  the  Aircraft Monitoring  and  Control  (AMAC)  and  release  systems  do  not  share  an  electrical connector with nonnuclear functions. 2.14.2.5.  Isolate critical circuits from potential sources of unintended electrical power. 2.14.3.  Switching. Switch the supply side or power side of switchable circuits.  For critical circuits, switch both the supply and return sides. 2.15.  Wiring and Cabling. 2.15.1.  Routing  and  Installation.    Install  and  secure  electrical  wiring  to  minimize  vibration and  chafing.    Cable  design  and  routing  shall  minimize  electromagnetic  coupling  between circuits and the potential for damage during maintenance operations. 2.15.2.  Shields.  Terminate cable shields at a connector backshell that provides for peripheral bonding  of  the  shield.    When  shielded  wires  and  cables  contained  within  an  overall  cable shield terminate with pigtails, the cable shield pigtails shall not exceed 6 inches.  Connector backshells shall have conductive finishes to minimize shield termination impedance. 2.15.3.  Grounds.  Use a common ground reference connection for signal returns common to two or more circuits.  Select ground wire or shield braid gauge that allows the largest current expected during system operation or credible failure.  A credible failure must not offset the ground plane reference voltage; offset it by an order of magnitude less than the level at which system  operation  or  logic  state  could  change;  or  cause  the  occurrence  of  ground-loop symptoms. 2.15.4.  Power  Cable  Terminations.    Except  for  weapon  and  warhead  interface  connectors, electrical power wiring shall end in female connectors at the power source side. 2.15.5.  Mechanical Support.  Provide critical circuit wiring with mechanical support that is an integral part of the connector at the entry point into the electrical connector.  Mechanical support should provide strain relief during mating and demating of connectors. 2.16.  Electrical  Connectors.  Ensure all hardwire electrical connectors associated with nuclear weapon  circuits  conform  to  MIL-DTL-38999-XX  series,  General  Specification  for  Connector, Electrical,  Circular,  Miniature,  High  Density,  Quick  Disconnect  (Bayonet,  Threaded,  and Breech  Coupling),  Environment  Resistant,  Removable  Crimp  and  Hermetic  Solder  Contacts.  This requirement does not apply to electrical connectors used within a line replaceable unit. 2.16.1.  Alignment  and  Mating.    Design  electrical  connectors  to  prevent  misalignment  of connector components and bent pins during mating.  Use diverse connector designs to ensure connectors  are  compatible  with  the  intended  connection  only  and  incompatible  with  other connectors.  Use only one wire for each pin and minimize the number of spare pins.  Do not use  these  pins  for  mechanical  support.    Provide  adequate  access  for  connector  mating  and demating operations.  If possible, make the mating and demating processes visible. 2.16.1.1.  Connector  Pin  Mapping.    Connector  pin  mapping  should  minimize  the likelihood of bent pins resulting in the inadvertent activation of a critical function. 2.16.2.  Sealing.    Use  environmentally  sealed  connectors.    If  used  in  electrical  connectors, potting compounds shall positively preclude reversion.   16  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 2.16.3.  Mandated  Use  Isolation  Exception.    If  possible,  design  the  circuits  within  a  single connector  to  meet  the  isolation  requirements  of  paragraph  2.14.2.    If  all  the  requirements cannot be met due to the mandated use of nonconforming weapons or equipment, connector pin  mapping  shall  ensure  no  single  bent  or  misaligned  pin  can  result  in  the  application  of sufficient power to cause critical function activation. 2.16.4.  Nonelectrical Connections.  Ensure connectors do not contain both critical electrical circuits and lines carrying liquids such as coolant solutions, fuels or hydraulic fluids. 2.17.  Electrical Current Considerations. 2.17.1.  Energy Control Concept.  Limit monitoring and testing current of ordnance devices to  a  value  at  least  an  order  of  magnitude  below  the  maximum  no-fire  level  of  the  most sensitive ordnance device or firing circuit component in a nuclear weapon system. 2.17.2.  Information  Control  Concept.    AMAC  System  2  implementation  requires energy  at the aircraft/weapon interface that may exceed no-fire levels of sensitive ordnance devices or firing  circuits  within  the  weapon.    Therefore,  monitoring  and  testing  electrical  energy controls must be implemented within the weapon to prevent activation of an ordnance device or firing circuit. 2.18.  Electromagnetic  Environment  (EME).  Provide  for  maximum  practical  protection against  the  hazards  of  Electromagnetic  Radiation  (EMR),  including  electromagnetic  pulse  and EMR  from  lightning.    Also,  provide  protection  from  direct  lightning  strikes  to  the  weapon system for all ordnance devices and firing circuits.  Ensure the design of nuclear weapon systems protects against the inherent EMR susceptibility to electro-explosives, semiconductors and other devices. 2.18.1.  EME  Levels.    Design  the  nuclear  weapon  system  to  achieve  a  classification  of Hazards  of  Electromagnetic  Radiation  to  Ordnance  (HERO)  SAFE  which  in  turn  shall  be in  accordance  with  AFI  91-208,  Hazards  Of HERO  certified  by  AFSEC/SEW Electromagnetic  Radiation  To  Ordnance  (Hero)  Certification  And  Management  .    The nuclear weapon system must be evaluated against and comply with MIL-STD-464, Table 9.  Compliance  shall  be  verified  by  test,  analysis,  or  a  combination  thereof  using  testing methodology  from  MIL-HDBK-240,  Hazards  of  Electromagnetic  Radiation  to  Ordnance Test Guide. 2.18.2.  Shielding  Design.    Ensure  critical  function  components  are  protected  against  EMR induced component damage or functional upset.  If feasible, use an integral shielded volume design consisting of shielded enclosures and wire and cable shielding. 2.18.2.1.  Shielded  Enclosures.    Locate  critical  function  components  within  shielded enclosures  that  provide  sufficient  attenuation  of  external  electromagnetic  fields  and surface  currents  to  preclude  electronic  component  damage  or  functional  upset.    The shielded  enclosure  design  shall  provide  radio  frequency  gasketing  for  enclosure  doors; minimize gap, joint and aperture sizes; and provide transient suppression for unshielded line  penetrations  into the  shielded  enclosure.   Where  conductive  aircraft  or  missile  skin surfaces  form  part  of  the  shielded  enclosure,  ensure  skin  joints  have  low-resistance contacts with fastener spacing designed to minimize gap sizes.  Design monitor circuits so they do not conduct or couple EMR energy into the shielded volume. AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   17  2.18.2.2.  Cable Shielding.  Refer to paragraph 2.15.2. 2.18.2.3.  Terminal  Protection  Devices  (TPD).    Use  TPDs  such  as  filters  and  surge suppressors  to  provide  additional  circuit  protection  where  shielding  alone  does  not provide  sufficient  attenuation.    Also,  use  TPDs  on  unshielded  line  penetrations  into  the shielded volume. 2.18.2.4.  Electro-Initiated  Devices  (EID).  Shield  all  EID  firing  circuits  using  a  twisted wire  configuration  with  the  case  of  the  initiator  electrically  bonded  to  the  structure.  A single  ground  point  shall  be  common  to  all  firing  circuits.  When  exposed  to  the  EME specified  in  MIL-STD-464,  Table  9,  the  maximum  root  mean  square  current  in  its bridgewire shall be 16.5dB below the maximum no-fire current of the EID for EIDs with a  safety  consequence.  The  margin  is  6  dB  for  EIDs  with  a  reliability  consequence. However, for ICBM systems, when exposed to the EMR environments specified in MIL-STD-464, Table 9, levels, the maximum root mean square current in its bridgewire shall be 20 dB below the maximum no-fire current of the EID regardless of safety or reliability consequence  for  the  EID.    EID  male  connectors  that  are  in  an  open-circuited configuration  must  install  shielding  caps  that  have  electrical  continuity  from  shield  to case with no gaps or discontinuities in the shielding configuration. Section 2D—Arming and Fuzing (A&F) Systems. 2.19.  General Design Criteria.  An A&F system is the sum of components, devices and design features that cause weapon prearming, arming, fuzing and firing as well as those components and features that protect against deliberate unauthorized or accidental prearming, arming, fuzing and firing.  Both DoD and DOE subsystems are normally a part of the total nuclear weapon system A&F design.  The DOE design satisfies many of the requirements in this section.  An effective design  incorporates  the  components  and  design  concepts  described  in  the  following  criteria  to satisfy the criteria in paragraph 2.2.1. 2.20.  System Devices. 2.20.1.  Prearm Device.  Design the A&F system to provide a unique prearming signal for the strong link prearm device in the warhead or nuclear bomb.  Derive this signal from some part of  the  weapon  system  under  direct human  control  to  provide  an  unambiguous indication  of human intent to use the weapon.  The function provided by human action shall be reversible up to the time of launch or release for aircraft systems or commitment to launch for ground-launched missiles. 2.20.2.  Environmental  or  Trajectory  Sensing  Device  (E/TSD).    Include  an  E/TSD  in  the A&F  system  design.    This  device  (preferably  a  strong  link  located  in  the  nuclear  bomb  or warhead)  prevents  arming  until  the  proper  environment  is  sensed  and  responds  only  to  an environment unique to the flight of the weapon.  Because this stimulus may occur as a result of the release of a nuclear bomb or the launch and programmed flight of an air-launched or ground-launched  missile,  prevention  of  premature  release  or  launch  of  the  weapon  is essential.    If  the  E/TSD  must  be  activated,  the  prearm  function  shall  be  a  prerequisite  to E/TSD activation. 2.20.3.  Launch  or  Release  Sensing  Device.    Include  a  device  in  the  A&F  system  that prevents power from being applied to the A&F system or applicable components within the   18  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 system until a weapon launch or release is detected.  For aircraft systems, this device (such as a pullout switch or breakaway connector) shall sense launch or release of the weapon.  For ground-launched  missiles, this device (such as  a lanyard or a pressure-actuated valve) shall sense  the  proper  launch  environment.    The  design  of  these  devices  shall  protect  against accidental or inadvertent operation. 2.21.  System Design Features. 2.21.1.  Abnormal Environment Protection.  Include protective features in the A&F system to prevent  prearming  and  arming  in  all  credible  abnormal  environments  specified  in  the  STS document and in the applicable weapon system specifications. 2.21.2.  Dual  Signal  Arming.    Incorporate  at  least  two  separate  and  independently  derived signals, which cannot be generated by a single signal at any point, to arm the weapon.  These signals are interrupted by (one or more) strong link devices located within the nuclear bomb or  warhead.    Ensure  at  least  one  of  the  signals  is  continuous  after  application  (required  for multiple power sources). 2.21.3.  Energy  Discharge.    Design  the  A&F  system  to  provide  for  automatic  discharge  of stored energy in the A&F energy storage devices such as capacitors and activated batteries, if arming power is interrupted. 2.21.4.  Lightning  Protection.    Incorporate  lightning  protection  to  protect  critical  A&F circuits. 2.21.5.  Nondestructive  Testing  Compatibility.    Ensure  exposure  to  standard  Air  Force nondestructive  testing  environments  such  as  X-ray,  ultrasonic,  magnetic  and  similar  tests specified for use in the weapon system does not degrade nuclear safety for the A&F system. 2.21.6.  Chemical  Compatibility  and  Reversion.    Ensure  all  material  used  in  the  design  is chemically compatible in all STS environments.  Do not use materials that could increase the high-explosive sensitivity, generate an explosive gas or electrically conductive gas, cause an electrical short or reversion or create similar results. 2.21.7.  Monitoring. 2.21.7.1.  Provide  the  capability  (always  placed  on  the  A&F  system)  to  monitor  the weapon state status in all weapon system configurations. 2.21.7.2.  Ensure  the  monitoring  function  design  prohibits  the  possibility  of  introducing energy  from  any  source  that  might  operate  an  A&F  critical  function  or  prevent  the transition  of  a  weapon  from  a  prearm  state  to  a  safe  state  if  a  system  fault  or  credible abnormal environment occurs (refer to paragraph 2.17).  Non-Electrical Monitor Systems shall be considered. 2.21.8.  Input  and  Output  Isolation.    Isolate  the  electrical  inputs  to  nuclear  safety  devices from  the  outputs  and  use  other  methods  (such  as  incompatible  signals)  to  minimize  the possibility of bypassing the safety devices. AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   19  Section 2E—Ground-Launched Missile Systems. 2.22.  General  Design  Criteria.  Apply  the  design  criteria  in  this  section  to  ground-launched missile systems and apply the noncombat delivery vehicle criteria in Chapter 3 to ground mobile combat delivery vehicles. 2.23.  Launch  Control  System.  This  system  consists  of  the  hardware,  firmware,  software  and secure codes used to authorize a missile launch and to launch the missile. 2.23.1.  System Design.  Apply these criteria: launch  shall  occur  only 2.23.1.1.  Missile the authorization and launch control devices.  No other system or subsystem, in operational or  failure  mode,  shall  be  able  to  authorize  a  missile  launch,  start  a  launch  sequence, launch a missile or operate the propulsion system. through intentional  operation  of 2.23.1.2.  Controlled  launching  requires  both  launch  authorization  and  launch  control functions.  Design  the  weapon  system  to  detect  and  resist  tampering  with  the  launch control system.  Continuous visual and audible indications to all Launch Control Points (LCP) shall occur when an attempt is made to operate the launch control system and the indications shall remain until the system operators acknowledge and reset them. 2.23.1.3.  The  launch  control  system  shall  remain  in  or  return  to  a  safe  state  when component failure or electrical power loss occurs. 2.23.1.4.  Arm  (operate)  and  safe  (off)  critical  command  signal  functions  shall  not  be complementary functions; that is, the absence of "arm" shall not be construed as "safe" or vice versa. 2.23.2.  Propulsion System Ignition Protection.  Protect the rocket propulsion system with an S&A  or  A/D  device  (or  equivalent  protection)  that  can  be  electrically  armed  by  a  directly applied unique signal (whose generator is not located in the missile) and can be electrically (refer to paragraph 2.8) and manually safed.  Generation of the unique signal requires some physical or electrical action unlikely to be produced by a credible abnormal environment. 2.23.3.  Multiplex  Control  Systems.    Use  multiplex  control  systems,  if  feasible,  for  critical signals within or between LCPs and Launch Points (LP); within the missile; and between the missile and reentry system or nuclear payload.  These safeguards apply: 2.23.3.1.  A  single  component  failure  or  system  fault  shall  not  cause  inadvertent transmission of critical signals or inadvertent operation of critical functions. 2.23.3.2.  The system design shall stop a change of state or an output of a critical signal if data synchronization is lost. 2.23.3.3.  The multiplex system design shall be compatible with system hazard and fault analyses so that the polling time interval and automation logic shall not mask any critical function activation or fault between successive polls.  If this requirement cannot be met for  all  credible  environments,  provide  a  means  for  dedicated  reporting,  automatic shutdown or priority interrupts. 2.24.  Reentry  System,  Reentry  Vehicle  or  Payload  A/D  Device.  For  each  ground-launched missile,  incorporate  an  A/D  device  in  the  reentry  system,  reentry  vehicle  or  payload  section  to   20  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 interrupt all power (except monitor power) to any warhead interface (refer to paragraph 2.8) and make it possible to safe this device for all weapon system configurations.  The A/D device is not needed if it can be shown that a single component failure shall not apply power to any warhead interface;  the  device  is  not  needed  to  meet  the  criterion  of  (AFI  91-107,  Table  2,  Rule  7)  for inadvertent  application  of  power  or  signals  to  the  nuclear  bomb  or  warhead  interface;  and provisions  exist  for  removing  power  to  the  missile  if  a  failure  occurs  that  could  contribute  to power being inadvertently applied to any warhead interface. 2.25.  Monitor Systems. 2.25.1.  Monitor  Requirements.    Provide  systems  that  allow  the  operator  to  continuously monitor  the  safe  status  of  the  missile  propulsion  system;  warhead  or  warheads  (refer  to paragraph 2.21.7); reentry system, reentry vehicle or payload section A/D device; and launch control system.  When the operator cannot continuously monitor these components, provide for  on-demand  monitoring  of  the  safe  status  while  ensuring  the  weapon  control  system continuously  monitors  each  of  these  devices.    Also,  ensure  the  operator  receives  a  positive and  timely  indication  of  any  change  in  the  safety  status  of  these  continuously  monitored systems. 2.25.2.  Power Removal.  Provide for automatic removal of electrical power that could cause accidental prearming or arming of the nuclear weapon or launching of the missile whenever an  unsafe  condition  is  indicated.    Power  can  be  restored  when  the  unsafe  condition  is corrected. 2.25.3.  Monitor Electrical Current Limitations.  Refer to paragraph 2.17. 2.26.  Command and Control Communications. 2.26.1.  Launch Control Points. 2.26.1.1.  The  launch  crew  shall  not  have  the  secure  code  necessary  to  authorize  the launch of or to launch a missile until launch authority is granted.  This withheld code may be used to satisfy the unique signal input requirement for all ignition protection devices.  A  code  that  authorizes  the  use  of  a  warhead  shall  be  different  from  the  code  used  to authorize the launch of a missile. 2.26.1.2.  For systems with a selective launch capability, the launch control system shall be  secured  to  allow  launch  of  one  or  more  missiles  without  revealing  or  compromising any of the codes for the other missiles or military forces. 2.26.1.3.  Policies  and  procedures  that  govern  the  authentication  and  safeguarding  of nuclear  control  orders  are  in  DoDD  (S)  5210.81,  United  States  Nuclear  Weapons Command and Control, Safety, and Security. 2.26.2.  Launch Control Points to Launch Point Communications and Code Devices. 2.26.2.1.  Ensure  nuclear  command  and  control  communications  meet  the  numerical standards  that  specify  the  minimum  degree  of  protection  required  against  the  threat  or commission of unauthorized launch actions by cognizant agents or third parties.  For any device operated by the withheld secure code discussed in paragraph 2.26.1.1, allow only a  limited  number  of  attempts  at  operation  using  incorrect  codes  or  include  some  other anti-tamper feature.  Also, include a device or system to detect tampering. AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   21  2.26.2.2.  Secure  critical  command  and  status  message  transmissions  against  tampering, monitoring and substituting.   If LCP and LP locations make physical security measures impractical,  encrypt  the  messages  and  authenticate  the  status  by  cryptographic  means.  The communications system shall alarm the LCPs if tampering with the system occurs. 2.26.2.3.  An  LP  may  respond  to  launch  commands  from  a  single  LCP.    Ensure  the critical LP status is monitored at the primary LCP and at least one other location.  Each location  shall  be  able  to  take  compensatory  action  if  an  unauthorized  critical  command message or status is detected. 2.26.2.4.  The LCP shall ensure that even after all secure codes are available; at least two people shall actively cooperate to command authorization and launch. 2.26.2.5.  Design  the  LCP  and  LP  secure  code  storage  devices  to  resist  bypass  or  code readout  and  ensure  access  to  the  storage  device  memory  is  controlled  to  prevent unauthorized code  changes.  Prohibit the use of  maintenance tools or  other devices that can change the memory to a standard unclassified code, except when the tool or device shall  stop  use  of  the  code  storage  device  for  its  intended  purpose,  which  must  cause  an alarm and positive indications to be received at the LCP. 2.26.2.6.  Make  the  signal  commands  for  controlling  the  critical  functions  of  prearming and launching unique, and do not store them in the weapon control system in a directly usable form.  Also, prevent inadvertent and deliberate unauthorized access and use of the unique  signals  by  such  means  as  deriving  unique  signals  from  secure  code  commands, storing the signals in permuted form and storing parts of the signals in separate locations. 2.27.  Mobile  Launch  Points  and  Mobile  Launch  Control  Points.  For  movement  of  a  fully assembled missile and reentry system or nuclear payload, add safety devices to maintain the safe state of missile propulsion and A&F systems in normal and credible abnormal environments. Section 2F—Aircraft and Air-Launched Missiles 2.28.  Criteria  Applicability.  Apply  the  design  criteria  in  this  section  to  aircraft  delivery, launch, suspension, release, and weapon monitor and control systems.  The safety devices these criteria  require  may  also  be  used  for  nonnuclear  stores,  except  where  their  use  is  specifically restricted. 2.29.  General    Design    Criteria.  Design  the  aircraft  nuclear  weapon  system  to  meet  these criteria: 2.29.1.  AMAC and Release System Electrical Power. 2.29.1.1.  Ensure  critical  functions  shall  not  occur  by  opening  a  circuit  breaker  or  other circuit protective device.  Also, do not connect operating power or control functions to a device (such as a semiconductor) whose major failure mode could cause activation of a critical function.  Aircraft electrical power failure shall not jeopardize the safe condition of a weapon. 2.29.1.2.  Power  the  monitor  and  control  functions,  unlocking  devices,  S&A  and  A/D devices  from  an  electrical  bus  that  can  be  automatically  powered  from  a  secondary  or backup power source if the primary power source is lost.   22  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 2.29.2.  Prearmed  Nuclear  Bomb  Release.    For  a  prearmed  nuclear  bomb  release  (not jettison),  apply  electrical  power  on  one  or  more  designated  pins  identified  in  the  AMAC specifications  of  the  weapon  interface  connector  before  and  during  electrical  separation  of the weapon from the aircraft. 2.29.3.  Inadvertent Power at Weapon Interface.  Ensure malfunction or accidental operation of a single component does not result in application of unintended power to the nuclear bomb or missile interface. 2.29.4.  Cable  and  Connector  Design.    Make  connector  pin  assignments  to  protect  against inadvertent application of prearm and arming power to the nuclear bomb or warhead as the result  of  damaged  cables  and/or  connectors.    The  design  shall  guard  against  cable  or connector  selection  and  cable  routing  susceptible  to  damage  during  assembly,  maintenance and test operations. 2.30.  Nuclear  Weapon  Suspension  and  Release  Systems.  Design the suspension and release system  to  prevent  weapon  separation,  release,  ejection,  launch  or  jettison  by  any  means  other than  proper  operation  of  control  devices.    Protect  all  mechanical  cables  in  the  system  from accidental  operation  and  withhold  electrical  power  to  suspension  and  release  components  until release preparation begins. 2.30.1.  Suspension  Lock  Monitor.    Ensure  the  latched  and  locked  condition  of  suspension devices is observable while the aircraft is on the ground.  Also, ensure the locked condition can be determined electrically while the aircraft is on the ground or in the air. 2.30.2.  In-Flight  Reversible  Lock.    Provide  an  in-flight  reversible  lock  that,  when  locked, prevents  weapon  release,  even  if  the  releasing  force  is  generated  and  transmitted  to  the release  system.    Make  the  lock  and  its  control  independent  of  the  nuclear  weapon  release system  and  the  electrical  connections  between  the  aircraft  and  the  weapon.    The  in-flight reversible lock system shall: 2.30.2.1.  Mechanically restrain the releasing device. 2.30.2.2.  Stop  release  or  launch  if  maximum  available  release  force  is  accidentally applied in the release mechanism. 2.30.2.3.  Fail safe in the event a failure occurs when the lock is locked. 2.30.2.4.  Disable all means of release when in the locked position. 2.30.2.5.  Permit  ground  personnel  to  visually  check  the  locked  state.    For  direct  visual inspection, the locking device itself shall present an unmistakable indication of the locked state. 2.30.2.6.  Be protected from accidental operation. 2.30.2.7.  Provide  a  method  in  the  crew  compartment  to  show  tampering  with  the aircrew's controls of the in-flight reversible lock. 2.30.2.8.  Provide the aircrew with a remote indication of the fully locked or unlocked (or both)  positions  of  the  in-flight  lock.    If  using  a  single  indication  for  the  locked  state, reflect  only  the  fully  locked  position  of  the  in-flight  reversible  lock.    If  using  a  single indication for the unlocked state, reflect every state other than a fully locked state.  The AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   23  remote indication system shall not allow an apparent indication to the aircrew of a locked state if an unlocked state exists. 2.30.2.9.  Ensure  the  safety  lock  mechanically  restrains  the  suspension  and  release linkage  if  hooks  are  used  in  the  suspension  and  release  linkage.    The  safety  lock  shall mechanically restrain each hook that can be individually latched or unlatched. 2.30.2.10.  Relock  if  unlock  power  is  removed  (accidentally  or  intentionally)  while  the lock is unlocked. 2.30.3.  Pylon Jettison.  Ensure pylons carrying nuclear weapons are either not jettisonable or the pylon jettison system includes a lock that meets the criteria for the nuclear weapons lock, as stated in paragraph 2.30.2. 2.30.4.  Unlock and Release Signal Isolation.  Physically and electrically isolate the discrete energy  control  signals  for  unlocking  the  in-flight  lock  and  releasing  the  weapon  to  the greatest  extent  possible.    A  release  system  fault  shall  not  be  able  to  operate  the  in-flight reversible lock and an in-flight reversible lock fault shall not be able to cause a release. 2.31.  Nuclear System Controls and Displays. 2.31.1.  Prearm and Safe Controls.  Ensure application of a prearm or safing command to a weapon  requires  a  control  or  control  setting  unique  to  the  selected  nuclear  weapon.    The control  or  control  setting  shall  require  a  separate  and  deliberate  act  by  the  weapon  system operator. 2.31.1.1.  Prearm  Command.    Design  the  prearm  control  as  a  unique  signal  generator command  signal  according  to  the  proper  specification  for  the  aircraft-to-weapon interface.  Do not have the information that defines the unique signal pattern within the stores  management  system  (SMS)  software  and  make  the  information  totally  defined through  aircrew  member  action.    Initiation  or  application  of  the  prearm  command  shall not occur in the event of an accident. 2.31.1.2.  Prearm Consent.  The function of prearm consent is to inhibit prearming until direct  aircrew  action  provides  the  required  consent  signal.    Design  the  prearm  consent control to reveal unauthorized operation or tampering. 2.31.1.2.1.  Electrical  Interface  (Non-MIL-STD-1760).    Make  the  prearm  consent function a hardwired control that interrupts power to the prearm circuit controlling the intent strong link. 2.31.1.2.2.  Digital  AMAC  Electrical  Interface  (MIL-STD-1760).    The  design  may implement  prearm  consent  through  software  inhibits  and  controls.    However,  the consent  signal  shall  originate  only  through  aircrew  action.    Removal  of  prearm consent shall result in terminating the prearm or release functions in process and shall inhibit  prearm  and  release  until  consent  is  reestablished.    Any  change  in  consent status shall also be sent to the weapon, which shall then inhibit any critical function processing under missile system control. 2.31.2.  Release and Launch Controls. 2.31.2.1.  Release  Consent.    In  the  operating  controls  for  the  release  system,  include  a nuclear consent function to inhibit unlocking the release system unless consent is given.    24  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 Nuclear  release  consent  shall  be  a  hardwired  function.    Neither  the  application  nor reapplication of nuclear release consent shall unlock or inhibit the locking of the in-flight reversible lock.  Removal of nuclear release consent shall relock the in-flight reversible lock. 2.31.2.2.  In-flight Reversible Lock.  Design the system controlling release or launch of a nuclear weapon with a unique hardware or software control or control setting for locking and unlocking the in-flight reversible lock.  Make this control separate from the release and launch controls and the release consent. 2.31.2.3.  Release Control or Control Setting.  In addition to the control for the in-flight reversible lock and the release consent, ensure release systems have at least one separate control  (hardware  or  software)  or  control  setting  unique  to  the  release  or  launch  of nuclear weapons.  This control or setting shall not be used to release or launch nonnuclear weapons. 2.31.2.4.  Aircrew  Member  Release  Input.    For  aircraft  designed  to  release  multiple nuclear stores, implement an aircrew member input to the release system controls before each  release  of  a  nuclear  weapon  on  a  target  or  series  of  releases  on  a  target  complex.  The  intent  is  to  specifically  preclude  the  automated  delivery  of  numerous  weapons without  further  aircrew  member  input  once  authorization,  nuclear  consent  (prearm  and release) and prearm are accomplished. 2.31.2.5.  Jettison  and  Emergency  Release.    Jettison  is  defined  as  the  release  of  an unarmed weapon.  If implemented, design the jettison function to only permit jettison of a nuclear  weapon  in  a  safe  configuration.    For  emergency  release  where  normal  jettison procedures cannot be accomplished, at least one distinct human action shall be required to  separate  a  prearmed  weapon  in  as  safe  a  state  as  possible  to  preclude  weapon detonation.    The  intent  of  this  distinct  human  action  is  to  provide  a  signal  to  exercise available options for returning the weapon to a safe state. 2.32.  Multi-crew Aircraft Consent Functions.  Design multi-crew aircraft AMAC and release systems with separate controls for both prearm and release consent.  Each consent function shall require  the  physically  separate  and  independent  actions  of  two  aircrew  members.    The functioning of these controls is called "nuclear consent."  A multi-crew aircraft used in combat by one person may have provisions for prearming and release by a single person if a bypass is done before flight. Design this bypass so a person cannot do it in flight. 2.33.  Aircrew Cautions.  Ensure an alert/notification is provided to the aircrew for these events: 2.33.1.  Uncommanded  Unlock.    Unlocking  of,  or  an  unlock  signal  going  to,  the  in-flight reversible lock when normal operation of controls has not commanded unlocking. 2.33.2.  Uncommanded  Prearm.    Prearming  of  a  weapon  occurs  when  normal  operation  of controls has not commanded prearming. 2.33.3.  Indeterminate  Weapon  State.    Warning  that  occurs  when  the  aircrew  cannot positively determine the safe state of the weapon.  A delay may be designed into this function so the aircrew shall not receive a caution during weapon change of state from safe to prearm or from prearm to safe. AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   25  2.33.4.  Uncommanded  Release.    Nuclear  weapon  release  signals  occurring  when  normal operation of controls has not commanded release. 2.34.  Nuclear  Weapon  Status  Monitoring.  Explicitly  indicate  the  safe  or  prearmed  state  of each  weapon  through  continuous  or  on-demand  monitoring.    Ensure  continuous  monitoring  is provided when a weapon is in a state other than "OFF."  Periodic monitoring on a multiplex bus communication system may satisfy this requirement. 2.34.1.  Monitor  and  Control  Circuit  Isolation.    Ensure  monitor  circuits  are  electrically isolated from power and control circuits;  and monitor functions are independent  of weapon control functions. 2.34.2.  Weapon  Monitor  States.    The  weapon  states  are  SAFE  and  PREARM,  with  a  "not safe"  condition  while  in  transition.    Define  the  corresponding  monitor  states  as  follows: SAFE - safe monitor true; ARM – arm monitor true; and ENABLE – PAL monitor true. 2.35.  Interface  Unit  and  Weapon  Power  Control.  Control  of  power  to  interface  units  and weapon interfaces shall require these actions and controls: 2.35.1.  Positive  action  to  supply  power  to  the  interface  unit  (logic  and  power  switching assemblies). 2.35.2.  Separate  control  that  removes  power  from  the  interface  unit  (logic  and  switching assemblies). 2.35.3.  Positive action to supply power at the weapon interface. 2.35.4.  Separate control that removes power from the weapon interface. 2.36.  Multifunction  Controls  and  Displays.  In  addition  to  the  other  control  and  display criteria of this chapter, these criteria also apply to a display system driven by software: 2.36.1.  Legends  and  Controls.    Screen  legends  next  to  control  buttons  shall  only  display  if the control button is active (capable of initiating a function).  Conversely, all active controls shall  have  legends  to  indicate  the  active  control  function.    All  AMAC  and  rack  lock  and unlock  commands  require  separate  controls;  for  example,  MONITOR  shall  not  become SAFE and LOCK shall not become UNLOCK by subsequent activation of the same button.  For multi- crew aircraft that do not meet this requirement, only one aircrew member at a time shall have control over weapon system functions.  Provide a capability to transfer this control function to another aircrew member (such as a "TAKE" command). 2.36.2.  Dedicated  Display.    When  power  is  applied  to  a  nuclear  weapon,  one  aircrew member  shall  have  control  of  nuclear  weapon  functions  and  at  least  one  display  shall  be dedicated  to  monitoring  weapon  status.    Generally,  the  monitoring  station  shall  also  be  the control  station.    Implement  scrolling  where  operational  considerations  make  dedication impractical and design the scrolling implementations in conjunction with a thorough advisory system that shall alert the aircrew to anomalous nuclear weapon system conditions when the display  is  not  present.    If  control  is  associated  with  the  scrolled  display,  ensure  return  of control  is  clear  and  immediate.    The  software  shall  not  permit  inadvertent  control  of  the nuclear weapon system while the display is scrolled away. 2.36.3.  Combined  AMAC  and  Release  Displays.    AMAC  and  delivery  functions  may  be combined on the same screen display; however screen formats shall clearly differentiate the   26  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 functions.    Software  protocols  (inhibits  and  critical  function  preconditions)  shall  minimize the possibility of executing an erroneously selected function. 2.36.4.  Allowable  Command  State  Transitions.    Except  for  the  SAFE-OFF  state  transition, each  nuclear  weapon  shall  transition  to  a  new  command  state  from  an  adjacent  command state (a command state is the last state the weapon was commanded to take).  The adjacent states  are  defined  according  to  this  sequence:  OFF-MONITOR-SAFE-ARM.   The appropriate  AMAC  specification  shall  define  these  command  states.    Change  of  state  shall occur only by an aircrew member’s explicit command and such transition commands shall be independent  of  the  monitored  state.    The  SMS  design  shall  ensure  these  control  rules  are followed when weapons are selected for a state change.  In the event of weapon system faults or  failures,  this  requirement  would  not  prevent  removing  all  power  from  the  weapon interface. 2.37.  Multiplexed (MUX) Systems. for 2.37.1.  Time-Division  Multiplexing standardization  purposes  (preferred  method  according  to  MIL-STD-1553,  Digital  Time-Division Command/Response Multiplex Data Bus).   Whenever  possible,  use  TDM (TDM). 2.37.2.  Discrete Signal Isolation.  All hardwired discrete signals in the MUX AMAC system shall meet the requirements of a totally hardwired AMAC system. 2.37.3.  Data Communication and Transfer. 2.37.3.1.  Only the correct stations, as determined by the system programming or control source,  shall  transmit  or  receive  data  on  the  SMS  MUX  bus.    Data  transfer,  change  of state  or  control  signals  shall  not  occur  until  the  correct  stations  are  successfully connected. 2.37.3.2.  Unauthorized stations transmitting or receiving data shall not affect the nuclear weapon interface. 2.37.3.3.  The MUX system shall inhibit any change of state or output of a remote MUX unit if data communication has been lost. 2.37.4.  Power  up  and  Shutdown.    The  MUX  AMAC  and  logic  power  subsystems  designs shall ensure that, after applying logic power to a MUX terminal unit, a startup routine shall verify  correct  operation  before  the  station  is  capable  of  output  to  the  weapon  or  release system.  Each MUX station shall operate safely during any change, application or removal of power from any part of the MUX system. 2.37.5.  Abnormal Environment Protection. 2.37.5.1.  Internal  MUX  Unit  Isolation.    Physically  separate  opposing  critical  functions (such as safe and prearm) as far apart as possible within each MUX terminal unit.  Within MUX  units,  provide  break-before-make  action  between  changes  of  state  of  all  critical signals applied to the nuclear weapon interface. 2.37.5.2.  Logic  Power  Levels.    Voltage  and  current  levels  required  to  operate  MUX station  logic  shall  be  sufficiently  below  operating  levels  to  minimize  the  probability  of operating critical functions if these voltages and currents are inadvertently applied to the nuclear weapon interface. AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   27  2.37.5.3.  Non-volatile  Memory.    Non-volatile,  nondestructive  read-only  memory  units are  required  to  store  MUX  AMAC  operational  programs,  algorithms  for  MUX  control, AMAC and release logic processing.  Ensure a deliberate, manually controlled action is required  to  alter  the  contents  of  those  memory  units.    If  the  MUX  AMAC  operational programs and logic processing routines are stored in a common memory unit shared with other functions, take special precautions to protect the AMAC and release portion. 2.37.6.  Built-in Test.  Self-testing shall not interfere with normal MUX operation, cause the generation  of  any  consent  signal  or  critical  signal  at  the  nuclear  weapon  interface.    Also, ground testing shall not degrade nuclear safety. 2.37.7.  Operator MUX Control. 2.37.7.1.  Only  positive  operator  control  over  the  MUX  bus  shall  generate  prearm  and separation  control  signals  to  the  nuclear  weapon  interface.    Critical  functions  shall  not occur  as  a  result  of  either  automatic  action  of  one  MUX  station  or  the  absence  of  data from the MUX bus. 2.37.7.2.  The  aircrew  shall  always  have  control  of  the  MUX  AMAC  system  and  be informed of failures or changes in MUX system capabilities. (T-1). 2.38.  Air-Launched    Missiles.  Until  launched  or  released,  an  air-launched  missile  is  an extension  of  the  aircraft.    Therefore,  apply  the  same  criteria  applicable  to  combat  delivery aircraft  (such  as  connector  design,  electromagnetic  radiation  protection,  electrical  subsystems and A&F systems) to the missile.  These criteria also apply: 2.38.1.  A&F System.  The A&F system shall contain: 2.38.1.1.  A unique signal S&A or A/D device for arming and safing the missile part of the  A&F  system.    The  warhead  prearm  switch  shall  not  serve  as  the  missile  system arming and safing device. 2.38.1.2.  A  launch  or  release  sensing  device  to  isolate  the  missile  A&F  system electrically and mechanically from any arming power source until a mechanical force is applied to the device during launch operation (such as a pull-out switch). 2.38.2.  S&A and A/D Devices (Propulsion or A&F Systems).  These requirements apply: 2.38.2.1.  Ensure  each  S&A  or  A/D  device  requires  a  weapon  system  operator  to  apply safing power. 2.38.2.2.  Incorporate  the  capability  to  monitor  the  missile  S&A  or  A/D  devices  for  the safe condition, either continuously or on demand.  Ground personnel shall be capable of visually monitoring the state of the devices. (T-1). 2.38.2.3.  If used with the propulsion system S&A or A/D devices, locate manual positive locks  where  they  can  be  removed  at  the  last  practical  point  in  the  aircraft  generation sequence. Section 2G—Test Equipment. 2.39.  General Design Criteria.  Apply the design criteria in this section to test equipment used to verify the proper operation, safe state and control of critical nuclear functions.   28  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 2.39.1.  Fail-Safe Requirements.  The test equipment design shall prevent these conditions: 2.39.1.1.  Faults in the test equipment or test circuits that could operate critical functions or apply unintended power to the weapon interface. 2.39.1.2.  Faults within a tester that could degrade the nuclear safety of the equipment to be tested. 2.39.1.3.  Introduction of signals, voltages or currents into the weapon system that could degrade nuclear safety. 2.39.1.4.  Operation or firing of an item under test, except when specifically designed for that purpose. 2.39.2.  Safe State at End-of-Test.  Test equipment shall ensure a weapon system component, which  has  been  operated  during  testing,  is  in  the  safe  or  inactivated  position  when  the  test ends.   A positive indication verifies the safe position of such components.  Test  equipment failures or shutdowns should leave the components under test in a safe condition. 2.39.3.  Built-In  Test  Equipment  (BITE).    Subsystems  or  system  features  that  require frequent periodic testing shall have built-in test modes or equipment, where possible.  BITE for nuclear weapon systems shall comply with all design and safety requirements that apply to  nuclear  weapon  systems.    With  nuclear  weapons  attached,  BITE  shall  not  operate  any nuclear critical function nor energize any critical circuits. 2.39.4.  Test Procedures.  The following criteria apply to equipment used to test the control, launch or release systems: 2.39.4.1.  Use test equipment only where necessary to set up and verify system operation, reliability  and  safety.    Minimize  the  amount  of  testing  done  after  mating  the  nuclear weapon to the combat delivery vehicle. 2.39.4.2.  Keep  the  interval  between  required  tests  on  nuclear  weapons  or  weapon systems  to  the  maximum  needed  to  maintain  a  high  confidence  level  in  the  system operation and safety. 2.39.5.  Periodic  Maintenance.    The  test  equipment  design  agency  shall  provide  periodic maintenance,  inspection,  test  requirements  and  procedures  for  the  test  equipment  so  the equipment shall continue to meet the original specifications. 2.39.6.  Functionality  and  Safety  Checks.    The  test  equipment  design  shall  include conducting  a  self-test  before  use.    Based  on  weapon  system  requirements,  design  the  test equipment  to  show  system  faults  (such  as  improper  wiring,  line-to-line  and  line-to-ground shorts, unintended voltage and improper system operation) using the following tests: 2.39.6.1.  Preloading tests shall test the functionality, as defined by the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) and AFSEC/SEWN, of the entire DoD/DOE interface. 2.39.6.2.  Preflight,  post-flight  and  periodic  testing  shall  occur  from  any  connector interfacing  with  the  weapon  to  the  furthest  termination  in  the  combat  delivery  vehicle (end-to-end check). 2.39.6.3.  Isolation  resistance  tests  of  all  critical  circuits  external  to  the  weapon  shall occur periodically. AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   29  2.39.6.4.  Where redundant features are present in the weapon system, test provisions or BITE shall indicate the integrity of both the redundancy and the function. 2.39.7.  Component  Failures.    Electrical test  equipment  (including  BITE)  used  with  nuclear weapons shall not cause or allow one component failure to result in: 2.39.7.1.  Generating of release or launch signals. 2.39.7.2.  Initiating of a critical function. 2.39.7.3.  Negating of Two-Person Concept control. 2.39.7.4.  Unlocking the in-flight reversible lock. 2.39.7.5.  Operating an S&A or A/D device. 2.39.8.  Test  Automata,  Software,  Firmware  and  Hardware  Generated  Using  Software.    All automata, software, firmware and integrated circuits used for testing or checkout shall meet the  provisions  in  AFMAN  91-119.    This  criterion  applies  to  software  that  receives,  stores, processes, or transmits data to monitor, target, prearm, arm, launch, release or authorize the use of a nuclear weapon. 2.39.9.  Electromagnetic  Effects.    Control  of  interference  and  susceptibility  within  test equipment  is  needed  to  prevent  responses  and  emissions  exceeding  MIL-STD-464, Electromagnetic  Environmental  Effects  Requirements  for  Systems,  levels.    The  design  of wires,  switches,  cable  connectors,  junction  points  and  other  electrical  system  elements  (as appropriate) shall prevent radiated and conducted interferences or transients. 2.39.10.  Test  Equipment.    Test  equipment  intended  to  test  the  AMAC  functions  at  the DoD/DOE  interface  shall  incorporate  parameter  limits  defined  by  the  appropriate  AMAC system specification and interface control documents. Section 2H—Technical Order (TO) Procedures. 2.40.  General  Criteria.  The  criteria  in  this  section  apply  to  developing  or  modifying  TO procedures  that  pertain  to  system  and  equipment  operational  certification,  training  and  cargo aircraft  loading.    Any  technical  order  change  that  may  impact  a  Nuclear  Certified  design  or configuration shall be reviewed by a Chief Engineer or designated representative IAW TO 00-5-3,  AF  Technical  Order  Life  Cycle  Management  and  AFI  63-101/20-101,  Integrated  Life  Cycle Management. (T-0) 2.41.  Operational  Certification  Procedures.  Before  mechanically  attaching  and  electrically connecting a nuclear bomb with an aircraft, a warhead to a cruise missile, a warhead to a reentry system,  or  a  re-entry  system  to  a  ground  launched  missile,  operationally  certify  the  AMAC system,  cruise  missile,  reentry  system  or  ground  launched  missile  as  appropriate.    These procedural requirements apply: 2.41.1.  Verify  proper  weapon  system/subsystem  critical  function  control  using  procedures that  define  a  sufficient  set  of  tests  and  conditions  necessary  to  confirm  system/subsystem operability and safety. 2.41.2.  Keep  test  requirements  to  a  minimum  after  the  nuclear  weapon  is  mated  to  the combat delivery vehicle.  The interval between required tests on nuclear weapons or weapon   30  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 systems  shall  be  the  maximum  needed  to  maintain  a  high  confidence  level  in  system functionality and safety. 2.41.3.  Ensure  test  equipment  used  to  verify  system  and  equipment  functionality  is  within applicable  calibration  intervals  and  is  in  fully  serviceable  condition  before  being  used  with the weapon system.  The design agency  shall provide procedures for periodic maintenance, inspection  and  testing  to  ensure  the  test  equipment  shall  continue  to  meet  the  original specifications. 2.42.  Cargo  Aircraft  Loading  and  Restraint  Procedures.  Loading procedures for mixed loads  of  nuclear  and  nonnuclear  cargo  shall  minimize  the  movement  of  the  nuclear  cargo  and shall position the nonnuclear cargo where it shall not collide with nuclear cargo (refer to MIL-DTL-25959, Aircraft Cargo Tie Down, Tensioners, MIL-DTL-6458, Aircraft Cargo Single Leg Tie  Down  Chain  Assemblies  and  SAE-AS8905,  Aircraft  Floor  Fittings  and  Tie  Down  Cargo Rings,).  Tiedown patterns and configurations require review by AFNWC engineering. Section 2I—Nuclear Weapons Maintenance, Handling and Storage Facilities. 2.43.  Criteria  Applicability.  Apply  the criteria  in  this  section  to  new and  existing  US  owned facilities  that  are  capable  of  supporting  nuclear  weapon  maintenance,  handling  and  storage operations.    Also  apply  AFCEC  design  criteria  published  in  ETL  11-7:    Nuclear  Weapons-Capable  Maintenance  and  Storage  Facilities,  as  it  relates  to  nuclear  weapon  safety  and  the essential facility systems listed in paragraph 2.45. 2.43.1.  Existing  Facilities.    Existing  facilities  and  facility  systems  are  not  required  to  be modified solely to meet the requirements of this chapter. 2.43.2.  New  Facilities  and  Facility  Modifications.    Any  new  facility,  as  well  as,  any proposed,  planned,  or  required  modification,  or  upgrade  to  existing  facilities  or  essential facility  systems  shall  require  nuclear  design  safety  certification  action  in  accordance  with AFI 91-103. 2.44.  General  Design  Criteria.  Facilities  (as  part  of  the  nuclear  weapon  system)  shall  be certified before conducting operations with nuclear weapons IAW AFI 91-103, AFPD 91-1, AFI 91-101, and DoDD 3150.02, DoD Nuclear Weapon System Surety Program.  Sections 2I and 4H of  this  manual  establish  the  Air  Force  design  and  evaluation  criteria,  respectively,  for  facility subsystems  that  can  directly  support  maintenance,  handling  and  storage  operations  for  nuclear weapons.    A  systems  engineering  approach  is  essential  for  nuclear  certification  of  facilities.  Facilities  and  the  essential  facility  systems  (EFS),  listed  below  in  paragraph  2.45,  shall  be designed  and  built  to  preclude  potential  electrical,  mechanical,  thermal,  electromagnetic radiation  and  chemical  insult  to  nuclear  weapon  systems,  assuming  the  occurrence  of  severe natural  phenomena  (e.g.,  lighting,  tornadoes,  earthquake),  an  explosive  detonation  or  other abnormal  event  (e.g.,  facility  power  surge,  electromagnetic  radiation,  fire,  blast,  dropping, striking,  etc.).    These  EFSs  and  any  subsequent  modifications  or  upgrades  to  these  EFSs  shall comply  with  the  criteria  below.    In  addition,  all  interface  or  connectivity  between  essential facility subsystems shall be designed to ensure that the nuclear surety environment has not been degraded  or  eliminated  (e.g.  the  interface  between  fire  alarm  and  the  Blast  Containment Management  System  (BCMS)  software  at  Kirtland  Underground  Munitions  Maintenance Storage Center). AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   31  2.45.  Design of Essential Facility Systems. 2.45.1.  Lightning  Protection  System  (LPS).    Facilities  shall  be  provided  with  a  LPS  in accordance  with  DoDD  6055.9E,  Explosives  Safety  Management  and  the  DoD  Explosives Safety  Board,  DoD  6055.09-STD,  NFPA  780,  Standard  for  the  Installation  of  Lightning Protection Systems, AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards, AFI 32-1065, Grounding Systems  and  UFC  3-520-01,  Interior  Electrical  Systems.    Underground  facilities  (excludes Earth  Covered  Magazines  [Igloos])  do  not  require  conventional  air  terminal  or  down conductor LPSs, but shall have a counterpoise grounding system that meets the requirements of NFPA 70, National Electrical Code, AFMAN 91-201, AFI 32-1065 and UFC 3-520-01. 2.45.2.  Nuclear Weapons Side Flash Protection Requirements. 2.45.2.1.  Default  Safe  Separation  Distance  (SSD).    Nuclear  weapons,  during  intrusive maintenance  operations,  shall  be  protected  from  lightning  side  flash  by  maintaining  a minimum  7-foot  separation  distance  between  a  weapon  and  the  walls,  ceiling,  hoists, structural  supports,  and  metallic  conductors  of  the  facility  in  accordance  with  AFMAN 91-201.    This  is  commonly  referred  to  as  the  7-foot  rule.    If  the  facility  (either  above ground  or  underground)  is  capable  of  supporting  intrusive  maintenance  operations, implementation plans and procedures for ensuring compliance with the 7-foot rule shall be documented.  Also, a physical demarcation (i.e. paint or tape) shall be readily visible and  clearly  indicate  the  area  in  which  intrusive  maintenance  operations  can  be accomplished.  When not in use, overhead hoists will have designated parking outside the 7-foot stand-off area, away from where maintenance operations are conducted. 2.45.2.2.  Alternative to 7-Foot Rule.  The required separation distance of the 7-foot rule can  be  significantly  reduced  by  implementing  the  design  feature  known  as  a  Faraday Shield  (referred  to  as  a  metallic  cage  by  NFPA  780)  including  electrically  bonding penetrations  to  the  Faraday  Shield  and  installing  proper  surge  suppression.    In  this approach,  the  facility  shall  be  tested  and  analyzed  to  determine  the  effectiveness  of  the facility  Faraday-like  Shield  characteristics.    Based  on  the  specific  test  results,  the  side flash and associated SSD within the facility may be reduced.  This process is referred to as facility characterization. 2.45.2.2.1.  Facility  Characterization  Design  Criteria.    To  accomplish  a  facility characterization,  the  following  measures,  in  order,  are  required  in  addition  to  the customary standards for LPS (refer to paragraph 2.45.1): 2.45.2.2.1.1.  Define  the  Faraday-like  Shield  boundary  of  the  facility  based  on facility construction. 2.45.2.2.1.2.  In addition to the bonding requirements in NFPA 780, AFMAN 91-201  and  AFI  32-1065,  provide  upgraded  or  additional  bonding  of  all  metallic penetrations  at  the  point  of  entry  to  the  defined  Faraday-like  Shield  using  a methodology  approved  by  the  Authority  Having  Jurisdiction  (AHJ)  prior  to implementation.  Bond lengths shall be kept as short as practical, ideally less than 4 inches and if possible/practical should go downward from the penetration to the Faraday-like Shield.  Bonds exceeding 4 inches in length shall require additional calculations  of  impedance,  voltage  and  side  flash  distance  corresponding  to  the current  of  a  worst  case  lightning  strike  traveling  through  the  bond  to  determine   32  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 the final SSD. 2.45.2.2.1.3.  Surge  suppression  shall  be  installed  on  all  incoming  service conductors  and  on  low  voltage  systems.    Surge  protection  shall  have  the capability to interrupt the energy levels of the established one percentile lightning strike.  This is defined as the 99 percent severity level in the DOE baseline STS.  When it is not practical to install suppression on communications and data circuits capable  of  interrupting  the  energy  levels  of  the  established  one  percentile lightning strike, alternatives approved by the AHJ shall be in place to mitigate the possibility  of  the  lightning  energy  from  entering  the  facility  through  these conductors. 2.45.2.2.1.4.  Perform  the  transfer  impedance  testing  of  the  facility  to  determine the  Faraday-like  Shield    characteristic  (i.e.,  determine  how  closely  the  facility demonstrates  Faraday-like  Shield  characteristics  –  electrical  connectivity  of reinforcing  steel  and  facility  structural  members  in  the  floor,  walls  and  ceiling) and associated SSD. 2.45.3.  Facility Power Systems.  Facility power systems shall incorporate an auxiliary power system to insure adequate power is maintained to subsystems that maintain safety or security of  nuclear  weapons  at  all  times.    Normal  and  auxiliary  power  systems  for  maintenance, handling and storage facilities shall be designed to meet the requirements of AFMAN 91-201 Explosive Safety Standards.  Emergency power systems shall meet the requirements of AFI 32-1062, Electrical Systems, Power Plants and Generators. 2.45.4.  Fire Protection Systems.  Fire suppression and alarm systems shall be incorporated in the  design  of  the  facility.    Automated  fire  suppression  systems  meeting  the  requirement  of NFPA 13, Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems, shall be provided unless a Fire Hazards Analysis (FHA) clearly indicates that an appropriate alternative to a fire suppression system is justified. 2.45.5.  Hoist, Cranes, Winches and Similar Devices.  Refer to the design criteria in Section 3C of this AFMAN. 2.45.6.  Security  Systems.    Security  systems  are  designed  and  implemented  IAW  DoD S.5210.41M_AFMAN  31-108,  The  Air  Force  Nuclear  Weapon  Security  Manual,  and applicable  MAJCOM  supplements.    Consider  the  safety  risks  from  the  possibility  of exposing  a  nuclear  weapon  (either  inadvertently  or  by  deliberate  unauthorized  acts)  to abnormal  environments.    Security  systems  that  directly  control  access  to  nuclear  weapons shall be designed to prevent unintended or deliberate unauthorized access.  The possibility of unintended  or  deliberate  unauthorized  access  shall  be  adequately  mitigated  through  a combination of design and procedural means. 2.45.7.  Facility  Security  System  Automata  and  Software  Design.    Ensure  automata  and software design is compatible with other facility safety and security systems IAW AFMAN 91-119. 2.45.8.  Blast  Containment/Isolation  Features.    Design  blast  containment  and  isolation features  IAW  AFMAN  91-201,  and  DoDD  6055.9E.    A  key  element  of  the  design  is  to mitigate contamination of facilities and weapons by limiting radiation transport mechanisms such as explosions/blast and fires.  Blast isolation design of the facility shall incorporate blast AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   33  zones/areas  for  the  purpose  of  limiting  the  spread  of  contamination  and  consequential damage  to  the  facility  and  stored  critical  assets.    Design  of  blast  containment/isolation systems  shall  consider  such  factors  as  siting  requirements,  blast  zones,  blast  pressures, isolation  requirements,  drainage  requirements  and  heating,  ventilating,  air-conditioning (HVAC).  Compatibility between these factors, when incorporated, shall be assured.  Ensure that the blast mitigation design prevents sympathetic detonation of nearby weapons by blast, fragment or thermal insult. 2.45.9.  Electromagnetic  Environment  (EME).    An  EME  in  a  facility  results  from  the combination  of  installed  and  portable  equipment  that  emits  EMR.    These  EMR  sources  in facilities  include  unintentional  emitters  such  as  lighting,  motors,  monitors,  communication equipment,  etc.,  as  well  as  intentional  emitters  such  as  radio  transmitters.    All  equipment installed or used within the facility, individually and collectively, shall not result in an overall EME that exceeds MIL-STD-464, Table 9 levels. 2.45.10.  Radiation Monitoring.  Design maintenance, handling and storage facilities with the ability  to  monitor  for  both  plutonium  and  tritium  as  required  for  appropriate  filtering, ventilation and/or isolation by a blast containment and management system.  This monitoring design  shall  work  in  conjunction  with  other  facility  systems,  especially  the  blast containment/isolation system, HVAC systems, and the fire alarm and suppression systems, to minimize collateral effects to both the rest of the facility and the local environment. 2.46.  Essential  Facility  System  Automata  and  Software.  Ensure  automata  and  software design  that  is  unique  and  developed  specifically  to  control  essential  facility  systems  is compatible with other facility safety and security systems IAW AFMAN 91-119.   34  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 Chapter 3 DESIGN CRITERIA FOR NONCOMBAT DELIVERY VEHICLES AND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT Section 3A—General Design Criteria. 3.1.  Design  Philosophy.  The  design  of  noncombat  delivery  vehicles  and  equipment  used  to transport,  store,  support,  load  and  unload  nuclear  weapons  shall  incorporate  positive  safety features.  The vehicles and equipment shall meet appropriate structural, environmental, stability and  mobility  requirements.    The  STS  document  defines  modes  of  transportation.    The  safety design factors shall allow for uncertainties in predicting operational conditions; uncertainties or variations  in  material  strength  and  manufacturing  techniques;  and  uncertainties  introduced  by simplified design and test procedures.  Good industrial  design practices, standards and features can be used to substantiate nuclear safety design certification of any commercially designed non- specialized  equipment  as  identified  in  AFI  91-103.    At  locations  outside  the  United  States  and territories, non-US design standards (i.e. European Specifications and Approvals) may be used in lieu of the listed US standards. 3.2.  Structural Load Definitions. 3.2.1.  Rated  Load.    Base  the  rated  load  on  the  combination  of  load  forces  the  basic equipment  must  support  or  resist  in  a  static  state.    This  rated  load  consists  of  one  or  more weapons  and  the  associated  handling  and  restraint  equipment  and  is  the  nuclear-certified load. 3.2.2.  Design Load.  The loads used to initiate the design of equipment shall be based on the rated  load  multiplied  by  a  factor  of  three  (3),  unless  higher  factors  are  required  due  to dynamic  loading.  Some  examples  of  dynamic  loading  are  accelerations  encountered  during air transport or towing operations. 3.2.3.  Stress Levels.  The stress level, under the static rated load condition, at  any point in the  structure  shall  be  limited  to  a  level  that  provides  a  factor  of  safety  of  three  (3)  against permanent deformation.  Where dynamic factors induce loads that exceed 1.5 times the rated load, as defined in paragraph 3.2.2,  then the stress level at any point in the structure shall be limited to a level that provides a factor of safety of two (2) against permanent deformation. 3.3.  Structural  Design  Criteria.  In  addition  to  meeting  the  design  load  requirements  of paragraph  3.2.2.,  ensure  the  design  shall  not  be  subject  to  a  primary  failure  mode.    A  primary failure  mode  is  any  material  failure  that  degrades  support  or  control  of  a  nuclear  weapon  and could result in weapon damage.  The interfacing of loading between systems shall be considered.  These are typical failure mode classifications: 3.3.1.  Elastic Failure.  Elastic failure is exhibited by excessive deflection. 3.3.2.  Plastic Failure.  Plastic failure is exhibited by material yielding (yield is experienced when  stress  levels  exceed  the  minimum  yield  strength  of  the  material,  as  specified  in applicable standards). AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   35  3.3.3.  Buckling Failure.  Buckling failure is exhibited by excessive and quick deformations (collapse)  with  a  loss  of  operational  capability.    Buckling  load  shall  not  exceed  1/2  yield strength of material. 3.3.4.  Fatigue  Failure.    Fatigue  failure  is  exhibited  by  a  fracture  incurred  by  the  cyclic application of loads. 3.3.5.  Composite Failure.  Composite failure is exhibited by any composite material failure such as material delaminating under compressive load. 3.3.6.  Ultimate Failure.  Ultimate failure is exhibited by material fracture. 3.4.  Data  Sources.  In  determining  allowable  stresses  for  equipment,  select  the  material  and allowable  stress  specified  in  government  publications  and  national  standards  (such  as  those produced  by  the  Society  of  Automotive  Engineers  or  the  American  Society  for  Testing  and Materials).    In  cases  where  both  an  average  and  a  minimum  stress  are  specified,  use  the minimum stress. Section 3B—Ground Transportation Equipment. 3.5.  Criteria  Applicability.  In  addition  to  the  general  criteria  of  this  section,  apply  the following  criteria  to  trailers  and  semitrailers,  self-propelled  ground  vehicles,  forklifts  and weapon loaders used to transport nuclear weapons on their basic structure. 3.6.  General Criteria. 3.6.1.  Frame Load Support.  Design equipment to support nuclear loads on the basic frame of the equipment rather than by lift arms, cables or hydraulic systems.  This requirement does not apply to equipment used only to position or transfer nuclear weapons within a designated area  (such  as  a  weapons  storage  area).    Hydraulic  or  pneumatic  suspension  systems  are acceptable. 3.6.2.  Static Grounding.  Provide grounding provisions for equipment designed for specific nuclear weapon systems to prevent static electrical discharge through the weapon. 3.6.3.  Fire  Propagation  Potential.    Design  the  equipment  to  minimize  the  potential  for  fire propagation. 3.6.4.  Shock Isolation.  Design the equipment to minimize mechanical shock transmission to a  nuclear  weapon.    This  would  include  a  Shock  Response  Spectra  analysis  for  the  system under load. 3.6.5.  Restraints.  Ensure restraint provisions for ground transport of all nuclear weapons are capable of restraining the design load with accelerations from paragraph 3.19. 3.6.6.  Engine Start Switch.  Ensure the engine start switch shall operate only when the clutch is disengaged or the automatic transmission is in the "neutral" or "park" position. 3.6.7.  Brakes.  All equipment capable of freewheeling, except locomotives and railcars (refer to  paragraph  3.10.1),  shall  have  parking  brakes  designed  to  hold  the  maximum  operational load on an 11.5-degree incline when headed both up and down, for a minimum of 15 minutes each.   36  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 3.6.8.  Stability.    Ensure  the  equipment  does  not  have  an  unsafe  tendency  to  tip,  tilt,  yaw, sway,  skid  or  jackknife  while  loaded  in  the  maximum  operational  configuration  and  while undergoing  maximum  performance  maneuvers  such  as  emergency  braking  and  obstacle avoidance. 3.6.9.  Mobility.  Comply with mobility requirements of applicable military standards and/or applicable  commercial  standards,  whichever  is  more  stringent,  and  meet  the  mobility requirements based on operational conditions.  Guidance can be found in MIL-HDBK-1784, Mobility, Towed and Manually Propelled Support Equipment and commercial standard SAE- AS8090, Equipment, Towed Aerospace Ground, Mobility. 3.6.10.  Identification Plates.  Identify the rated load and gross vehicle weight on all vehicles. 3.6.11.  Roadability.  Ensure the equipment meets the minimum roadability requirements in the  STS,  Capability  Development  Document    (CDD),  Capability  Production  Document (CPD) or weapon system specifications. 3.6.12.  Adverse Environments.  Demonstrate the equipment’s ability to operate safely in the most  adverse  environments  as  specified  in  the  STS,  CDD,  CPD  and  weapon  system specifications. 3.7.  Trailers and Semitrailers.  In addition to the general criteria of Section 3A and paragraph 3.6, include these design features in trailers and semitrailers (does not apply to commercial semi-trailers considered nuclear certified in accordance with AFI 91-103): 3.7.1.  Service  Brakes.    Ensure  service  brake  systems  meet  the  requirements  derived  from MIL-HDBK-1784. 3.7.2.  Emergency  Brakes.    Design trailers  using  tow  bars with  an emergency  brake  system that  shall  activate  automatically  and  bring  the  trailer  to  a  controlled  stop  in  case  of inadvertent tow bar disconnect. 3.7.3.  Mobility.  Comply with the mobility requirements derived from MIL-HDBK-1784. 3.8.  Tow  Vehicles.  In  addition  to  the  general  criteria  of  Section  3A  and  paragraph  3.6,  tow vehicles (such as trucks, tugs and tractors) shall have these design features:  (does not apply to commercial semi-trailers considered nuclear certified in accordance with AFI 91-103). 3.8.1.  Brake  System.    The  brake  system  shall  be  functionally  compatible  with  the  towed vehicle brake system.  The towing vehicle shall not jackknife under maximum performance maneuvers.  Brake performance shall comply with applicable industry standards and meet the failure criteria for towed vehicles in MIL-HDBK-1784. 3.8.2.  Parking  Brakes.    Ensure  that  the  parking  brakes,  together  with  the  towed  vehicle parking brakes, can hold a maximum operational load and towed vehicle combination on an 11.5-degree incline when headed both up and down for a minimum of 15 minutes each. 3.8.3.  Tow  Vehicle  to  Trailer  Interconnect  Device.    Make  the  vehicle  connecting  device compatible with the towed vehicle and ensure it meets the structural design criteria of Section 3A or commercial standards, whichever is more stringent. 3.8.4.  Fifth Wheel Safety Latch.  Equip the fifth wheel with a safety latch designed to allow a visual check of the locked condition. AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   37  3.8.5.  Vehicle  Structure.    The  tow  vehicle  structure  should  be  designed  to  accept  loads induced by including the item in tow, tow bar and not exceed the stress levels in paragraph 3.2.3. 3.9.  Self-Propelled  Vehicles.  In  addition  to  the  general  criteria  of  Section  3A  and  paragraph 3.6,  ensure  vehicles  (such  as  trucks,  vans  and  high  lift  trucks)  comply  with  the  brake performance requirements in paragraph 3.8.1. 3.10.  Rail-Based Vehicles.  In addition to the general criteria of Section 3A and paragraph 3.6, apply these criteria to railroad locomotives, railcars and similar equipment: 3.10.1.  Parking  Brakes.    Ensure  the  locomotive  parking  brakes,  with  the  railcar  parking brakes,  can  hold  a  fully  loaded  railcar  and  locomotive  combination  on  a  3-degree  incline when headed both up and down for a minimum of 15 minutes each. 3.10.2.  Railroad  Standards.    Comply  with  all  applicable  standards  of  the  American Association of Railroads. 3.10.3.  Rail Bed Requirements.  Use only classes 3 through 6 on rail-based vehicles carrying nuclear weapons. 3.11.  Forklifts  and  Weapon  Loaders.  In  addition  to  the  general  criteria  of  Section  3A  and paragraph 3.6, include the following design features in equipment such as conventional forklifts, bomb-lift and high-lift trucks, munitions handling trailers with lifting devices and 463L loading and unloading trucks:  (For European forklifts, see paragraph 3.11.5). 3.11.1.  Lift Systems.  Design the lift system so it maintains safe control of the rated load if electrical,  hydraulic  or  pneumatic  system  failure  occurs.    Include  pressure  relief  valves  or regulators in hydraulic and pneumatic systems to prevent overpressure.  To prevent weapon damage, limit internal leakage in lift system hydraulic components so the maximum drift rate does not exceed 0.5 inch per hour. 3.11.2.  Tines  and  Adapters.    Design  tines  and  adapters  for  forklifts  or  bomb-lift  trucks  to safely meet all nuclear weapon operational requirements for the equipment.  Ensure that the equipment center of gravity and the rated load center of gravity are compatible. 3.11.3.  Movement  and  Positioning  Controls.    Provide  for  positive  control  of  the  nuclear weapon at all times in the lifting and handling modes.  Apply these criteria: 3.11.3.1.  Make  all  movement  controls  self-centering  (except  for  such  devices  as  the parking  brake,  steering  control,  transmission  selectors,  power  takeoff  and  hydraulic pump). 3.11.3.2.  Add  mechanical  stops  or  electrical  switches  to  prevent  over  travel  in  all directions of the lift control. 3.11.3.3.  Include  in  the  weapon  loader  a  capability  for  small  increments  of  movement (inching) in both reverse and forward directions. 3.11.3.4.

However,  make   38  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 3.11.4.  Parking Brakes.  Ensure forklift parking brakes can hold a forklift with rated load on an  8.5-degree  incline  in  both  forward  and  reverse  directions.    Weapon  loader  service  and parking brakes shall be able to independently hold a maximum operational load on an 11.5- degree incline with the weapon loader headed either up or down. 3.11.5.  European Forklifts.  European forklifts are considered nuclear certified provided the standards  listed  in  the  tables  below  have  been  met.    Any  updates  to  these  standards  will require review by the process owners to  ensure there are no significant changes that  would invalidate their nuclear certification. (T-0). 3.11.5.1.

Blocks  and  rope  falls,  fiber  rope  and  webbing  require  a  minimum  safety factor of 10 based on ultimate strength. 3.14.2.  Chains  and  Accessories.    Load  chains  and  all  accessory  parts  such  as  hooks,  rings, shackles,  slings  and  wire  rope  require  a  minimum  safety  factor  of  5  based  on  the  ultimate strength. Section 3D—Handling and Support Fixtures. 3.15.  General  Design  Criteria.  Design  items  such  as  load  frames,  hoist  trolleys,  test  and storage stands, and handling units to meet the structural design criteria in Section 3A. 3.15.1.  Mobility.    Ensure  test  and  storage  stands  and  handling  units  with  casters  meet  the mobility requirements of applicable military standards and operational requirements. 3.15.2.  Stability.    All  handling  and  support  structures  shall  show  that  they  are  stable  (no excessive  movement  or  tendency  to  tip  or  buckle)  while  laterally  loaded  to  a  minimum acceleration of 0.5g.  This can be shown by test or analysis or a combination of testing and analysis. 3.16.  Weapon  Containers.  Use  the  design  criteria  in  MIL-STD-209,  Lifting  and  Tiedown Provisions  and  MIL-STD-648,  Design  Criteria  for  Specialized  Shipping  Containers  for containers used for storing and transporting weapons. 3.17.  Pallet  Standards.  Pallets  used  with  nuclear  weapons  shall  conform  to  MIL-STD-1366, Transportability  Criteria,  for  ground  transport  and  MIL-STD-1791,  Designing  for  Internal Aerial Delivery in Fixed Wing Aircraft, for air transport. Section 3E—Air or Ground Transport Systems, General Use Tiedowns and Restraints. 3.18.  General  Air  or  Ground  Transport  Design  Criteria.  Design  air  transportable  delivery vehicles  and  support  equipment  to  meet  the  general  specifications  of  MIL-STD-1791.  Ground transport  shall  conform  to  MIL-STD-1366,  Transportability  Criteria  and  the  North  American Cargo Securement Standard for cargo restraint levels. 3.18.1.  Pallet Lock Systems.  Pallet lock systems on cargo shall fail-safe (i.e., a single point failure of an active component shall not result in an uncommanded release of the pallet).   40  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 3.19.  Cargo Restraint Configuration Criteria for Air or Ground Transport.  In addition to the  general  criteria  of  paragraph  3.18,  the  nuclear  cargo  restraint  configurations  must  comply with these criteria: 3.19.1.  Minimum  Tie-down  Provision  Condition.    Industry  working  load  of  tie-down equipment should be used for determining the items working load rating.  *Restraints must be  loaded  appropriately  for  comparison  to  be  valid.    As  an  example  chains,  wire  rope  and fabric  straps  cannot  be  loaded  in  compression,  they  only  function  in  tension.    Thus,  a summation of force calculation must be performed on the tie-down device to determine the tie-down device load. 3.19.2.  Ground Transport Requirements.  Ground transport envelopes as shown in Table 3.3 are  based  on  North  American  Cargo  Securement  Standard  Ground  transport  directional accelerations  (refer  to  Figure  3.1).    Each  directional  load  is  evaluated  without  friction between  the  trailer  decking  and  the  cargo.    Evaluate  statically  and  independently  using  the restraining  device  rated  working  load.    Furthermore,  the  restraint  assembly  must  remain connected when not under tension. Table 3.3.  Ground Transport Envelopes. Vertical Upwards     0.2g Vertical Down          Not Considered Forward                    0.8g 0.5g Aft                    Lateral                 0.5g Figure 3.1.  Ground Transport Directional Accelerations.  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   41  3.19.2.1.  Tie-down restraining devices are shown in Table 3.4. Table 3.4.  Tie-Down Restraining Devices. Synthetic webbing Chain Clamps and latches Webbing ratchet Shackles Wire rope D-rings Grab hooks Binders 3.19.2.2.  To  identify  a  tie-down  for  a  load  in  the  forward  direction,  first  determine  the load  on  the  restraint  device  in  the  forward  direction  by  using  a  summation  of  forces  to determine tie-down device load (Table 3.5). Table 3.5.  Forward Load (Ground Transport). Accelerating Mass x 0.8g = Forward load. 3.19.2.3.  Repeat the calculation for the other directional accelerations.  Use the forward load  to  choose  a  tie-down  device  by  finding  a  tie-down  restraint  with  a  manufacturer rated working load greater than or equal to the calculated load.  This criterion is derived from MIL-STD-1791and MIL-STD-209 and commercial ground transport standards. 3.19.3.  Air Transport Requirements.  Air transport envelopes shown in Table 3.6 are based on  directional  accelerations  (refer  to  Figure  3.1).    Each  directional  load  is  evaluated  to  the material  ultimate  strength  (breaking  strength)  statically  and  independently  with  a  safety factor of 1.5 applied.  Fiber straps are not permitted for air transport. Table 3.6.  Air Transport Envelopes. Vertical Upwards       3.7g  Note: Effectively 2.7g when opposing gravity Vertical Down            4.5g  Note: This includes standard gravity of 1g, otherwise 3.5g Forward                      3.0g Aft                              1.5g Lateral                        1.5g 3.19.3.1.  To  identify  a  tie-down  for  a  load  in  the  forward  direction,  first  determine  the load  on  the  restraint  device  in  the  forward  direction  by  using  a  summation  of  forces  to determine tie-down device load (Table 3.7). Table 3.7.  Forward Load (Air Transport). Accelerating Mass X 3.0g X 1.5 = Forward Load 3.19.3.2.  Repeat the calculation for the other directional accelerations.  Use the forward load to choose a tie-down device by finding a tie-down restraint with an ultimate strength greater  than  or  equal  the  calculated  load.    This  criterion  is  derived  from  MIL-STD-1791and MIL-STD-209 and commercial transport standards. Notes:  (for both load conditions).  Any safety factors associated with industry such as is used by the National Association Chain Manufacturers guidelines are based on the variance and manufacturing tolerances of the items to   42  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 guarantee the item can meet the working load.  Secondary safety factors are not to be included in the derivation of proper tie-down device sizing. 3.19.4.  Ensure reaction forces on aircraft floor, pallet or trailer deck do not exceed the rated capacity for those items.  Ensure that all tie-down points (e.g., tie-down rings) do not exceed their rated capacity. 3.19.5.  Cargo  restraint  configurations  shall  be  compatible  with  weapon  design  to  prevent inadvertent activation of environmental sensing devices. AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   43  Chapter 4 EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEMS Section 4A—General Philosophy and Criteria. 4.1.  Criteria Applicability.  This chapter outlines the minimum evaluation criteria engineering agencies  shall  apply  to  combat  aircraft,  missiles,  subsystems,  technical  order  procedures,  and facilities  to  include  facility  systems  and  subsystems  before  AFSEC/SEWN  shall  grant  nuclear safety design certification according to AFI 91-103. 4.1.1.  Organizational    Responsibilities.    The  Air  Force  organization  with  engineering responsibility  for  each  specific  system  or  subsystem  shall  develop  the  evaluation  plan  and conduct the tests and analyses needed to demonstrate the adequacy of nuclear safety features. (T-0).  In addition to the evaluation criteria in this chapter, the responsible engineering office shall  define supplemental criteria (based on system and subsystem specifications pertaining to nuclear safety design requirements) applicable to the unique design features of the system being developed or modified. (T-0)  This requirement also applies to Air Force organizations with  responsibility  for  providing  engineering  and  compatibility  guidance  for  a  system  or subsystem  developed  by  an  allied  country  for  use  with  US  nuclear  weapons.  (T-0).    The organization  with  engineering  responsibility  and  the  appropriate  nuclear  safety  evaluation agency shall determine the adequacy of proposed and completed designs, surveys, tests and analyses to meet nuclear safety requirements.  (T-1). 4.1.2.  Evaluation Source Data. 4.1.2.1.  The data from surveys, tests and analyses are essential in making nuclear safety evaluations.    Both  qualitative  and  quantitative  analyses  provide  a  basis  for  these evaluations.    The  analyses  shall  consider  and  be  compatible  with  the  concept  used  to design the system; that is, energy control and information control. 4.1.2.2.  When  military  specifications  or  standards  exist  that  satisfy  nuclear  safety requirements,  the  responsible  agency  can  meet  the  test  and  analysis  requirements  by showing that those specifications or standards have been met. 4.1.3.  Numerical  Evaluations.    Tests  or  analyses  (or  both)  may  be  used  to  establish  that numerical design criteria as defined in AFI 91-107 are met.  However, demonstrating by test or  analysis  that  a  numerical  criterion  is  satisfied  is  not  sufficient  in  itself  to  establish  the adequacy  of  the  design.    An  assessment  of  the  safety  features  of  the  weapon  system,  using the applicable qualitative design criteria that implement the positive measures required by the DoD  Nuclear  Weapon  System  Surety  Standards,  shall  support  the  evaluation  against  the numerical criteria. 4.1.4.  System-Level  Evaluations.    The  primary  concerns  of  nuclear  weapon  system  safety analyses are unauthorized or accidental nuclear detonation; accidental prearming of a nuclear weapon; accidental launch, release or jettison of a nuclear weapon; accidental power applied to  the  nuclear  weapon  interface;  and  circumvention  of  the  Two-Person  Concept  (where applicable)  for  authorization,  launch,  prearm  or  unlock.    For  analysis  purposes,  express accident  rates  for  both  the  warhead and  delivery  system  in  the  same  units.    Use  worst-case generic failure rate data for these required analyses:   44  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 4.1.4.1.  System  and  Subsystem  Hazards  Analysis.    From  the  conceptual  through  post design phases, perform  general  analyses  of each subsystem  and  major  component;  their relationship to each other and their interfaces; environments that could affect them; and hazards they could cause. 4.1.4.2.  Preliminary  Hazard  Analysis.    Early  in  the  design  phase,  conduct  a  complete, qualitative  and  nonmathematical  assessment  of  the  hardware  safety  features.    This analysis can provide the basis for determining other required analyses. 4.1.4.3.  Fault  Hazard  Analysis.    This  analysis  starts  during  the  demonstration  and validation  phase.    It  provides  component-level  information  on  failure  modes,  effects, causes and common-cause susceptibilities within a given subsystem.  The information is used in fault-tree and common-cause analyses. 4.1.4.4.  Operating  and  Support  Hazard  Analysis.    This  analysis  starts  during  the demonstration and validation  phase.  It evaluates the hazard potential due to  procedural flaws  or  personnel  errors  during  each  phase  of  the  STS.    Hazards  that  contribute  to  the primary  concerns  listed  in  paragraph  4.1.4  are  the  primary  focus  of  the  analysis.    The information is used in fault-tree and common-cause analyses. 4.1.4.5.  Fault-Tree  Analysis.    This  analysis  starts  during  the  full-scale  engineering development  phase.    It  provides  qualitative  and  quantitative  measures  of  nuclear  safety relative to the primary concerns listed in paragraph 4.1.4. 4.1.4.6.  Common-Cause Analysis.  This analysis starts during the full-scale engineering development  phase  after  the  fault-tree  is  constructed.    It  uses  the  fault-tree  minimal  cut sets  (or  prime  implicants)  to  qualitatively  assess  system  susceptibility  to  potential common-cause failure mechanisms. 4.1.4.7.  Circuit  Logic  Analysis.    Conduct  a  circuit  logic  analysis  during  developmental and  post  design  phases  to  determine  the  possibilities  of  accidental  operation  of  critical circuits.   Include  studies  of  electrical  and  electronic  systems  to  determine  the  effects  of component failures on the circuit operation. 4.1.4.8.  Bent  Pin  Analysis.    If  not  covered  by  any  other  analysis,  perform  a  bent  pin analysis  to  verify  pin  assignments  and  power  sources  designed  according  to  paragraph 2.16.1.  This analysis shall evaluate the likelihood of critical functions occurring due to bent connector pins. 4.1.4.9.  Safety  Testing.    When  required  by  the  system,  subsystem,  equipment  failure modes  and  effects  analysis,  perform  the  following  safety  validation  tests  and  consider them an integral part of the development and acceptance tests or the demonstration tests: 4.1.4.9.1.  Laboratory demonstrate partial verification of safety characteristics or procedures. functional  mockups,  models  or  simulations tests, to 4.1.4.9.2.  Safety  tests  on  devices  and  components  associated  with  critical  functions to determine the degree of hazard or margin of safety. 4.1.4.9.3.  Induced  failure  tests  to  demonstrate  the  failure  mode(s)  of  components associated with critical functions. AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   45  4.1.4.9.4.  Evaluations  of  support  equipment  for  nuclear  logistics  movement  and ground mobile combat delivery vehicles according to Chapter 5. 4.1.5.  Design and Procedural Priorities.  Comply with safety requirements in this order: 4.1.5.1.  Ensure safety through incorporation of proper design features. 4.1.5.2.  Use  additional  safety  devices  when  safety  requirements  cannot  be  met  by  the basic design. 4.1.6.  Explosive  Ordnance  Disposal.    Evaluate  aircraft  and  missile  systems  to  ensure adequate emergency access is permitted to those components and circuits as required to carry out render-safe procedures.  Analyze the systems to ensure render-safe procedures meet the requirements of paragraph 2.5. 4.1.7.  Environmental  Criteria.    Derive  the  environmental  requirements  for  each  nuclear weapon system from the predicted normal and credible abnormal operational environments.  Consider all possible environments with the goal of preventing an adverse response under all conditions.    Use  the  STS  as  the  basic  document  to  define  operational  environments,  both normal  and  credible  abnormal,  for  nuclear  bombs  and  warheads.    The  DoD/DOE Environmental Data Bank is another source of data. 4.1.8.  S&A  and  A/D  Devices.    Test  and  evaluate  these  devices  according  to  MIL-HDBK-1512. 4.1.9.  Protection  of Friendly Territory.   Evaluate and test the weapon system design for its adequacy  to  prevent  accidental  or  deliberate  unauthorized  changes  in  targeting.    Also, evaluate  the  system  to  ensure  adequate  safety  design  features  exist  to  prevent  nuclear detonations, except within the boundaries of the designated target area. 4.1.10.  Human  Engineering.    Using  accepted  human  engineering  factors  and  methods, conduct error analyses and error-reduction studies to identify weapon system modes that may cause hazardous conditions. Section 4B—Automata, Software, Firmware, Integrated Circuits and Hardware. 4.2.  Criteria Applicability.

An  example  of  an  integrated  circuit  being generated using software is the use of Very-High-Speed Integrated Circuits (VHSIC) Hardware Description  Language  (VHDL)  to  design,  simulate  and  synthesize  an  Application  Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). 4.2.1.  Circuitry Designed with Automated Tools.  Critical circuitry designed with automated tools (e.g. synthesized from VHDL) shall be verified IAW AFMAN 91-119. 4.2.2.  Reprogrammable  Circuitry.    Reprogrammable  circuitry  (e.g.  the  contents  of  a  Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) shall be protected IAW AFMAN 91-119. 4.2.3.  Circuits  with  Embedded  Software.    Critical  circuits  with  embedded  software  or firmware are subject to AFMAN 91-119.   46  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 4.2.4.  Electronic Circuits Controlling Critical Signals or Performing Critical Functions.  The integrity  of  critical  functions  implemented  with  electronic  circuits  must  be  protected  as delineated in AFMAN 91-119. 4.2.5.  Programmable Logic Devices.  Critical circuitry incorporating FPGA’s or other logic devices subject to single event upset shall employ redundancy or other discipline to protect the    integrity  of  the  critical  function  for  all  credible  environments  of  the  circuits  IAW AFMAN  91-119.    Reliability  goals  specified  in  AFI  91-107  are  sufficient  for  systems incorporating programmable logic devices. Section 4C—Electrical Subsystems and Hazards. 4.3.  Criteria  Applicability.

DoDD  3222.3-AFPD  33-5,  DoD  Electromagnetic Environmental  Effects  (E3)  and  outline  responsibilities to  ensure  electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of all military communications/electronics equipment, subsystems, and systems during conceptual, design, acquisition and operational phases.  Before the system is certified,  the  evaluation  agency  shall  produce  data  that  cover  EMR  hazards  to  electro-explosive,  semiconductor  and  other  devices.    The  evaluation  shall  include  these  data  as  a minimum. (T-1). 4.3.1.1.  Data attesting to system design adequacy to the effects of static electricity, EMC, EMI,  external  EMR  and  lightning.    Demonstrate  system  tolerance  to  these  potential hazards by full-scale or scale-model tests or through analyses. 4.3.1.2.  EMR susceptibility data and results that verify the shielding effectiveness of the total  system.    Demonstrate  the  tolerance  of  the  total  (includes  combat  delivery  vehicle and  nuclear  weapon)  nuclear  weapon  system  to  continuous  wave  and  pulse  fields throughout the entire STS, over the frequency range of 100 kHz to 40 GHz. 4.3.2.  Isolation  Requirements.    Conduct  tests  and  analyses  required  to  ensure  compliance with the electrical isolation of the unlock, release, launch and AMAC circuits. Section 4D—Arming and Fuzing (A&F) Systems. 4.4.  Criteria Applicability.  These criteria supplement the aircraft or missile system evaluation criteria.  The evaluation of the A&F subsystem design shall include: 4.4.1.  A&F  System  Devices  and  Safety  Features.    The  A&F  subsystem  evaluation  shall include  a  summary  description  of  the  A&F  design  and  a  qualitative  assessment  of  the primary design safety features in the prearming, arming and fuzing functions. 4.4.2.  Component Failure Analysis. (T-0) 4.4.2.1.  The  A&F  evaluation  shall  identify  any  component  failure  modes  that  could contribute  to  premature  prearming  or  arming.    For  each  failure  mode,  determine  a nominal  probability  of  occurrence  (along  with  the  associated  tolerance  or  confidence level) and give the basis for the probability estimates in each case. AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015   47  4.4.2.2.  Accomplish  a  thermal  analysis  on  each  component  that  can  be  thermally operated,  all  thermal-protective  components  and  design  features,  and  all  explosive components.

Premature nuclear detonation during storage and logistics operations (system not prearmed). 4.4.3.2.  Premature nuclear detonation for each stage of prearming and arming. 4.4.3.3.  Premature nuclear detonation after the system is armed. Section 4E—Ground-Launched Missile Systems. 4.5.  Criteria  Applicability.  The  design  evaluation  of  ground-launched  missile  systems  shall ensure nuclear safety and security requirements are met.  When the implementation of system or equipment  specifications  shall  result  in  hazards,  the  system  manager  shall  conduct  a  trade-off study to achieve maximum nuclear safety consistent with operational requirements.

Perform an analysis of the nuclear weapon system’s UL susceptibility according to AFI 91-106, Unauthorized Launch, Threat Mitigation, and Launch Action Studies.  The objectives are to identify possible ways to  accomplish  a  UL  by  negating  the  nuclear  safety  design  safeguards  of  a  nuclear  weapon system  and  to  assess  the  means  of  detecting  a  UL  attempt  and  what  countermeasures  to apply.  The analysis may reveal design deficiencies in the system involving human actions or component failures. Section 4F—Aircraft and Air-Launched Missiles. 4.6.  Criteria Applicability.  The design evaluation of aircraft and air-launched missile systems shall  ensure  nuclear  safety  and  security  requirements  are  met.

In addition to the general requirements of paragraph 4.1, conduct the following: (T-1). 4.6.1.  Nuclear  Safety  Design  Certification.    Design  certification  of  an  aircraft  nuclear weapon  system  is  based  on  satisfying  the  requirements  in  AFI  91-103.    Procedures  for obtaining  nuclear safety design certification shall consist  of a design evaluation by test and   48  AFMAN91-118  28 JULY 2015 analysis  (where  applicable)  of  the  weapon  system  to  assure  the  system  complies  with  the nuclear safety design criteria in this manual. 4.6.2.  Design  Certification  Analysis.    The  system  evaluation  (where  applicable)  shall integrate the general analyses (refer to paragraph 4.1); automata and software analyses IAW AFMAN  91-119;  electrical subsystem assessment  (refer to paragraph 4.3); A&F subsystem requirements  (refer  to  paragraph  4.4);  test  equipment  analysis  requirements  (refer  to paragraph 4.7); and Nuclear Weapon Maintenance, Handling and Storage Facilities analysis requirements  (refer  to  paragraph  4.8).
