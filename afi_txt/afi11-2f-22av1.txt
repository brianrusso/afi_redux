Ensure pilots only participate in sorties, events, and tasks for which they are adequatelyprepared, trained, and current. 1.2.5.12.  ACC squadrons will submit a training report to HQ ACC/A3TO (ANG: ACC/A3G)every 4th month during the training cycle (always at the end of Jan, May, Sep for all). Squadronsmay submit an out of cycle report at anytime if Higher Headquarters (HHQ) assistance is requiredto prepare for Designed Operational Capability (DOC) or AEF tasking. Reports will consist of: 1)an email memo summarizing results or unresolved issues since the last report, current trainingplan summary, and significant shortfalls/Limiting Factors (LIMFACS) affecting training. 2) afilled out squadron training health slide (attachment to email memo) summarizing critical trainingissues. Both items IAW the guidance and examples at the web site https://do.acc.af.mil/dot/DOTO/Fighter/FighterTeam.asp . Reports will reflect on different phases of training unique toeach AEF pair. Key reports are the Post-AEF (end of the 1st month after AEF Vulnerability (Vul)period) and the Pre-AEF 4 months prior to AEF Vul period, others are snapshots of a squadron’straining health. Report only significant shortfalls/LIMFACS of events/sorties that affect 15% orgreater of the squadron’s crew force. Include possible solutions or specific assistance required ifable. HQ ACC will attempt to rectify or minimize noted shortfalls/LIMFACS while the trainingcycle is under way. 1.2.5.12.1.  Shortfalls occur when required mission training tasks are not accomplished due toshortages of equipment, munitions, etc. Example: unable to accomplish actual weaponsrelease due to a shortage of training weapons. AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 200671.2.5.12.2.  LIMFACS are factors, constraints, restrictions, etc. that degrade training effective-ness. Example: squadron's ability to accomplish actual weapons release is limited due to thelack of ranges that allow aircraft to drop munitions. This may include support hardware andsoftware. 1.2.5.12.3.  All deviations from these training requirements, after proration, will be reported toACC/A3TO (ANG: ACC/A3G) with the Post-AEF training report (end of the 1st month afterAEF Vul period) IAW paragraph 1.2.4.5. above. This includes requirements waived by OG/CC. Email training reports to ACC/A3TO RAP program manager at  accdoto.rapreport-ing@langley.af.mil , DSN 574-8323 (ANG: Email training reports to ACC/A3GO ataccdog.rapreporting@langley.af.mil , DSN 574-4099). 1.2.6.  Individual pilots will: 1.2.6.1.  Hand carry all available training records to assist the gaining unit in assessing qualifica-tions and training requirements. 1.2.6.2.  Be responsible for completion of training requirements and currencies within the guide-lines of this volume. 1.2.6.3.  Ensure they participate only in ground and flying activities for which they are qualified,current, and prepared. 1.3.  Processing Changes:  1.3.1.  Forward recommendations for change to this volume to MAJCOM A3 on AF Form 847, Rec-ommendation for Change of Publication. 1.3.2.  MAJCOMs will forward approved recommendations to HQ ACC/A3. 1.3.3.  HQ ACC/A3 will: 1.3.3.1.  Coordinate all changes to the basic volume with all MAJCOM/A3s. 1.3.3.2.  Forward recommendations for changes to this volume to HQ USAF/A3OT for HQUSAF/A3 approval. 1.3.3.3.  Address time sensitive changes by immediate action message. 1.3.3.4.  MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: HQ ACC/A3G) will determine training requirements for subordi-nate units. This includes making changes, additions, or deletions to this volume at any time. Thesechanges may be via supplement or RAP tasking memo . HQ ACC/A3 will be an info addressee onall changes. 1.4.  Training.  Pilot training is designed to progress a pilot from Initial Qualification Training (IQT) (B Course or Tran-sition/Re-Qualification Training (TX)), then to Mission Qualification Training (MQT), and finally toContinuation Training (CT). 1.4.1.  IQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify pilots in a basic position and flyingduties without regard to a unit's mission. Upon completion of IQT, the pilots attain Basic AircraftQualification (BAQ) status. BAQ is a prerequisite for MQT. Except for General Officers above the8AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 2006wing level, BAQ is not a long-term qualification status. Waiver authority for any pilot, other than gen-eral officers above the wing level, to remain BAQ is MAJCOM A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G). 1.4.2.  MQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify or re-qualify pilots in a specific posi-tion and flying duties to perform the missions assigned to a specific unit. Pilots maintain BAQ statusuntil they complete MQT. Completion of MQT or formal training unit (FTU) instructor course is apre-requisite for BMC and completion of MQT is a pre-requisite for CMR. 1.4.3.  CT. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of pilot training in the basic flying skillscontained in Table 4.2. These skills (Non-RAP requirements) ensure safe operation of the aircraft.The second consists of specific mission-related training required to accomplish the unit's assignedmissions. 1.4.4.  Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) is the CT program designed to focus training on capabilitiesneeded to accomplish a unit's core tasked missions. Following completion of IQT and MQT, pilotswill have received training in all the basic missions of a specific unit, unless excepted in Chapter 3.Pilots will then be assigned to either a Combat Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable(BMC) position. 1.4.4.1.  CMR. The minimum training required for pilots to be qualified and proficient in all ofthe primary missions tasked to their assigned combat unit and weapons system. 1.4.4.2.  All designated combat aircraft (CC-coded) unit active duty API -1 positions, flying SQ/CC and SQ/DO positions are designated CMR positions. OG/CCs may designate other API -6positions not assigned to the flying squadron as CMR. (EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned,the SQ/CC may elect to train the front line of their Unit Manning Document (UMD) API -1s toCMR and designate the overage BMC. In this case, priority should be given to inexperiencedpilots with at least 50%, if available, designated CMR.) For ANG: Any pilot may be designatedCMR or BMC at OG/CC discretion. CMR pilots maintain proficiency and qualification in all coremissions of the flying unit to which they are assigned or attached. CMR pilots maintain currencieswhich affect CMR status, accomplish all core designated flight training (sorties and events), andall mission ground training. Failure to complete this training or maintain these currencies results inregression to Non-CMR (N-CMR) status unless waived by appropriate authority. While N-CMR,pilots may perform missions (including exercises and contingencies) and events in which they arecurrent and qualified at the discretion of the SQ/CC. 1.4.4.3.  BMC. The minimum training required for pilots to be familiarized in all, and may bequalified and proficient in some of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weaponssystem. 1.4.4.4.  All active duty wing pilot positions that are not designated CMR positions, are BMCpositions. BMC designations are assigned to pilots who have a primary job performing wingsupervision or staff functions that directly support the flying operation, or are FTU instructors, oroperational test pilots. However, these pilots are required to provide additional sortie generationcapability, either in lieu of or in addition to, the personnel assigned to the flying squadrons. BMCpilots maintain familiarization with all unit core missions. They may also maintain proficiencyand qualification in some of the unit core missions. For those missions in which they maintainfamiliarization only, BMC pilots must be able to attain proficiency and qualification in 30 days orless. BMC pilots accomplish all mission related ground training designated by their attached SQ/CC. BMC pilots may deploy and may participate in any mission for which they are proficient andAFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 20069qualified, without additional training, as determined by the SQ/CC. Failure to complete BMCrequired training results in regression to non-BMC (N-BMC) status. While N-BMC, SQ/CC willdetermine missions the pilots may perform and supervision required. 1.4.4.5.  N-CMR/N-BMC. Pilots that regress to N-CMR/N-BMC status will accomplish therequirements in accordance with paragraph 4.7. 1.4.4.6.  Specialized Training. Specialized training is training in any special skills necessary tocarry out the unit's assigned mission that is not required by every pilot. Specialized training con-sists of upgrade training such as flight lead upgrade (FLUG), instructor pilot upgrade (IPUG), etc.,as well as CT to maintain proficiency and qualification in unit tasked special capabilities and mis-sions. Specialized training is normally accomplished after a pilot is assigned CMR/BMC status;and is normally in addition to CMR/BMC requirements. Unless otherwise specified, pilots inCMR or BMC positions may hold special capabilities/qualifications as long as any additionaltraining requirements are accomplished. 1.5.  Training Concepts and Policies:  1.5.1.  Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness consis-tent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for realism against theexpected threat, pilot capabilities, and safety. This volume provides training guidelines and policiesfor use with operational procedures specified in applicable flying/operations publications. 1.5.2.  ACC Training Support Squadron (ACC TRSS) will develop and validate training programswhen/where tasked by the HQ ACC/A3. Other MAJCOMs may submit requests for training programsupport to the HQ ACC/A3. If validated, these requests will be prioritized and tasked to ACC TRSS.Designated test units (CB-coded) may develop syllabi to upgrade Operational Test Pilots in support ofspecific test plans. These syllabi will be approved by the OG/CC and submitted to ACC TRSS. 1.5.3.  Design training missions to achieve combat capability in squadron tasked roles, maintain pro-ficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. RAP training missions should emphasizeeither basic combat skills, or scenarios that reflect procedures and operations based on employmentplans, location, current intelligence, and opposition capabilities. Use of procedures and actions appli-cable to combat scenarios are desired (e.g., appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures,combat tactics, safe recovery procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions, Intelbriefing/debriefing). Tactical training will include use of inert and live ordnance, threat simulators,countermeasures, and dissimilar aircraft as much as possible. 1.5.4.  In-flight Supervision:  1.5.4.1.  Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of supervision necessary toaccomplish the required training. If the mission objectives include introduction to tasks or instruc-tion to correct previous discrepancies, then an instructor pilot (IP) may be required. 1.5.4.2.  IPs and flight lead (FL)-qualified Squadron (SQ) supervisors may allow any pilot to leadlimited portions of a mission if they are appropriately briefed. This provision will only be used toallow the pilot to practice events in which the pilot is already qualified or to help determine if thepilot is ready for FLUG. In either case, the IP or SQ supervisor is responsible for the flight. 10AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 20061.5.4.3.  Flight leads may give their wingman the tactical lead for specific tasks. As the tacticallead, the wingman makes tactical decisions for the flight, but the flight lead retains overall author-ity and responsibility. 1.6.  Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Policy and Management:  1.6.1.  The RAP training cycle is equal in length to the AEF cycle. RAP tasking is aligned with asquadron’s specific AEF pair and executed IAW RAP tasking memo. If not assigned to an AEF pair,or assigned to multiple AEF pairs, RAP tasking is aligned to the AEF cycle itself. Each RAP qualifi-cation level is defined by a total number of RAP sorties, broken down into mission types, plus specificweapons qualifications and associated events as determined by the MAJCOM and unit commanders. 1.6.2.  The total number of RAP sorties for a qualification level is the primary factor for maintainingan individual's qualification level. The breakout of sortie/mission types is provided as a guideline tobe followed as closely as possible but minor variances (other than Red Air allocations) are authorized.Variations in sortie/mission types may be used as a basis for regression by the SQ/CC. Qualification ina mission is determined by the SQ/CC considering the MAJCOM guidance and the individual's capa-bilities. 1.6.3.  An effective RAP training sortie requires accomplishing a tactical mission profile or a buildingblock type sortie. Each profile or sortie requires successfully completing a significant portion of theevents applicable to that sortie type, as determined by the SQ/CC and Attachment 2. 1.6.4.  The SQ/CC's first priority should be to train all designated pilots to CMR. 1.6.5.  Progression from BMC to CMR requires: 1.6.5.1.  A 1-month look back at the higher sortie rate. 1.6.5.2.  Qualification in all core missions, and weapons events required at CMR. 1.6.5.3.  Confirmation that the progressed pilot can complete the prorated number of sortie/eventrequirements remaining at CMR by the end of the training cycle. 1.6.5.4.  Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification or certi-fication. 1.6.5.5.  Squadron CC certification. 1.6.6.  SQ/CCs will determine and assign pilots that will train for and maintain special capabilities orqualifications. Specialized training is normally accomplished in addition to baseline CMR/BMC sor-tie/event requirements; except for mission commander and flight lead training. 1.6.7.  Wing CMR and BMC pilots will fly the required monthly sortie rate. If unable, refer to Regres-sion, paragraph 4.7. 1.6.8.  End of Cycle training requirements are based on the pilot's experience level on the last day ofthe current training cycle. 1.6.9.  Units converting to another mission-design-series (MDS) may fly pilots in CMR positions atthe BMC rate until one month prior to the operationally ready date if the CMR sortie rates cannot besupported. CMR pilots should be flown at a CMR rate for the month prior to initial operational capa-bility (IOC). Active duty wings converting to new MDS are authorized one SQ equivalent (7/6 for 24/18 or less Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI)) of additional API-6’s during the conversion period. How-AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 200611ever, total wing staff flying the new aircraft shall not exceed total authorized for final conversion equi-page. 1.7.  Training Sortie Program Development:  1.7.1.  RAP mission/sortie and event requirements (see Attachment 2 for definitions) apply to CMRand BMC pilots as well as those carrying special capabilities or qualifications and are IAW the RAPtasking memo . The standard sortie requirements at Table 1.1. establish the minimum number of sor-ties per training cycle for BMC and CMR levels of training. The RAP tasking memo takes precedenceover this volume, and may contain an updated sortie requirement or missions/events not yet incorpo-rated in Attachment 2. 1.7.2.  Non-RAP requirements (Instrument) are in addition to RAP requirements. These sorties ensurebasic pilot skills are maintained (see Table 4.2.). All active duty units are also allocated Navigationsorties for their API -1 pilots. These sorties ensure that pilots maintain their skills necessary to operatesafely in the civil airspace environment. 1.7.3.  Experiencing/Collateral sortie requirements must be considered when developing unit flyinghour programs. 1.7.3.1.  Experiencing sorties are additional training sorties necessary to achieve desired profi-ciency in optimum time. RAP sorties may not provide sufficient hours to experience pilots toachieve overall unit experience levels. The USAF sets a required number of hours to experiencepilots and a percentage goal of the unit pilots that should meet these requirements. 1.7.3.2.  Collateral sorties are not directly related to combat employment training but are neces-sary in day to day unit operations. These include but are not limited to functional check flights,ferry flights, deployments, and air shows. For the training cycle, the MAJCOM allocates a blockof sorties to the unit for these purposes. 1.7.4.  Unit flying hour programs are allocated a number of attrition sorties that compensate fornon-effective training sorties. Non-effective sorties are logged when a training sortie, RAP orNon-RAP, is planned, but a major portion of valid training for that type of mission is not accomplisheddue to poor weather, air aborts, etc. In order to accurately allocate the number of attrition sorties, it isessential that non-effective sorties are logged appropriately.

Pilots willreview their own data with their flight/element member(s). 1.9.2.  As a guide, the following DVR items should be reviewed: titling, weapons parameters, triggercheck, identification procedures, adherence to Training Rules (TR), communications procedures anddiscipline, flight discipline, proper Anti-G Straining Maneuver IAW para 6.4.2.5., tactical employ-ment, and instrument approaches. 1.10.  Pilot Utilization Policy:  1.10.1.  Commanders (CCs) will ensure wing/group tactical pilots (API -1/6s) fill authorized positionsIAW unit manning documents and that pilot status is properly designated. The overall objective is thatpilots perform combat-related duties. Supervisors may assign pilots to valid, short-term tasks (escortofficer, flight evaluation board (FEB)/mishap board member, etc.), but must continually weigh thefactors involved, such as level of pilot tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience. For inex-perienced pilots in the first year of their initial operational assignment, supervisors will limit thenon-flying duties to those related to combat activities. 1.10.2.  Duties required by various publications that may be assigned to CAF API -1 pilots are weap-ons and tactics officer, programmer, flying safety officer, supervisor of flying (SOF), mobility/ contin-gency plans, training (except ARMS documentation), SQ Standardization/Evaluation Liaison Officer(SELO), squadron life support officer, electronic combat officer, and other duties directly related toflying operations (runway operations monitor [ROM], range control officer [RCO], etc.). In someinstances, such as squadron-assigned flying safety officers, API -1s may be attached to the wing. API-1s will not be attached to wing staffs or man wing staff positions unless total wing pilot API -1 man-AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 200613ning is 100 percent or better. CCs will ensure wing staff pilots (API -6s) perform duties justified inmanpower standards documents and authorized in UMDs. 1.11.  Sortie Allocation Guidance:  1.11.1.  Inexperienced API -1 pilots should receive sortie allocation priority over experienced pilots.Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows: 1.11.1.1.  Formal Training Units and USAFWS. Formal syllabus training, Instructor Upgrade,Instructor CT, authorized staff personnel not performing Instructor or Flight Examiner (FE) duties 1.11.1.2.  Operational Units. CMR API -1, MQT API -1, CMR API -6, MQT API -6, and BMC.1.11.1.3.  Test and Test Evaluation Squadron (TES) Units.  Requirements directed by MAJ-COM, training required to prepare for assigned projects/tasking, BMC training requirements thatcannot be accomplished on primary missions. 1.11.2.  Wing API -6 authorizations are IAW unit manning documents. 1.11.3.  For FTU only wings, all API -6 pilots will maintain instructor status (optional for WG/ OGCC, functional check flight (FCF) pilots, and one other). These wings will fly API -1/6 pilots asrequired by programmed flying training (PFT). 1.11.4.  API-8 rated personnel flying authorizations, ACC/IGS inspectors in API-6 billets, and TestUnit aircrews will be IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM guidance. API-8 pilots will fly the BMC sortierate, however they are not required to complete BMC specific missions/events or meet monthly look-back requirements. Test unit pilots will fly the BMC sorite rate as a minimum and should meet montlyBMC lookback. SQ/CCs will direct additional sorties if syllabus or test missions provide insufficientpilot proficiency training. Units should provide assigned API 6/8 flyers adequate resources to main-tain minimum training requirements. However, API-6 flyer support will not come at the expense ofthe flying squadron's primary mission. API 6 flyers will accomplish non-RAP requirements withallotted BMC sorties. API-8/ACC IGS flyers will strive to accomplish non-RAP requirements withallotted BMC sorties. If attached units cannot meet attached flyer requirements, they must requestrelief IAW AFI 11-401, as supplemented. Units requiring flying hour adjustments for attached API-8and applicable API-6 flyers must request program changes IAW MAJCOM directives. 1.11.5.  (ANG: N/A) There is no maximum sortie requirement for CMR pilots. Table 1.2. defines themaximum sortie requirements for other pilots per training cycle. On occasion, unique operations mayrequire pilots to fly more than the maximum number of sorties authorized, however, this may impacttraining of other pilots. 1.11.6.  Aircrew assigned or attached to ACC/IGS as API-6 will maintain RAP currencies /lookbackper API-8 guidance. 14AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 2006Table 1.2.

General. This chapter outlines Initial Qualification Training (IQT) of pilots into unit aircraft. IQTincludes Basic (B course) and transition/re-qualification/senior officer (TX) training and normally will beconducted during formal syllabus courses at formal training unit (FTU) squadron whenever possible.Graduates of F-22A FTU will be proficient in F-22A air-to-air and air-to-ground mission tasks as indi-cated by the Master Task List/Course Training Standards MTL/CTS of the FTU syllabus. In addition, TXstudents will graduate current and qualified in ACBT, LASDT CAT I (500’), JDAM, NVG, high-altitudephysiology and receive differences training if operational aircraft possess greater capability than FTU air-craft. In exceptional circumstances, when FTU training is not available within a reasonable time period,IQT may be conducted at the local unit IAW provisions of this chapter. This local IQT will normally beconducted using appropriate formal USAF Transition or Re-qualification Training Course syllabus tracks,flow programs, and requirements. When local IQT is authorized, the gaining MAJCOM assumes respon-sibility for the burden of providing this training locally. The following guidance applies only to other thanformal course IQT. 2.2.  Approval/Waiver for IQT:  2.2.1.  MAJCOM/A3/XO (ANG: NGB/A3T) is approval authority to conduct local IQT, and (ANG:HQ ACC/A3G) is waiver authority to change the formal requirements of locally conducted IQT. InfoHQ ACC/A3T. 2.2.2.  MAJCOM/CC (ANG: ACC/CG) is the approval authority for non-formal course IQT for Colo-nel selects and above to be conducted at the unit to which the officer is assigned. 2.2.3.  Requests to conduct local IQT will include the following: 2.2.3.1.  Justification for the local training in lieu of formal course training. 2.2.3.2.  Summary of individual's flying experience, to include last centrifuge training date. 2.2.3.3.  Date training will begin and expected completion date. 2.2.3.4.  Requested exceptions to formal course syllabus, with rationale. 2.2.4.  Successful completion of IQT requires the upgrading pilot to complete an aircraft qualificationand instrument evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 (AFI 11-2F-22AV2, F-22A--Aircrew Evaluation Crite-ria). 2.3.  Prerequisites. Course prerequisites will be IAW the appropriate formal course syllabus and theUSAF Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA). 2.4.  Ground Training.  Ground training may be tailored to the individual’s background and experience or peculiar local condi-tions. However, available and current reference materials such as AFTTP 3-3, Combat Aircraft Funda-mentals, instructor guides, and audiovisual programs should be used as supporting materials to themaximum extent possible. Simulator missions may be accomplished in a Full Mission Trainer (FMT), orweapons and tactics trainer (WTT), if the FMTs are not available in the Mission Training Center (MTC). 162.5.  Flying Training:  AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 20062.5.1.  Mission sequence and prerequisites will be IAW the appropriate formal course syllabus. 2.5.2.  Training will be completed within the time specified by the syllabus, as approved. Failure tocomplete within the specified time limit requires notification through channels to MAJCOM/A3(ANG: ACC/A3G) with pilot's name, rank, reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated comple-tion date. 2.5.3.  Pilots in IQT will fly under IP supervision until completing the qualification checkride. 2.5.4.  Formal course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum requirements for IQT. How-ever, additional training events, based on student proficiency and background, may be incorporatedinto the IQT program with authorization of the SQ/CC. Additional training due to student non-pro-gression is available within the constraints of the formal course syllabus and may be added at the dis-cretion of the SQ/CC. 2.6.  IQT for Senior Officers:  2.6.1.  All formal training courses for senior officers (colonel selects and above) will be conducted atthe FTUs unless waived IAW paragraph 2.2. 2.6.2.  Senior officers must meet course entry prerequisites and will complete all syllabus require-ments unless waived IAW syllabus and paragraph 2.2. 2.6.3.  If senior officers must be trained at the installation to which they are assigned, they will be informal training status. Unit duties will be turned over to appropriate deputies or vice commandersuntil training is completed. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by MAJCOM/CC (For ANG:ACC/ CG. For AETC: 19AF/A3). AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 200617Chapter 3   MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING 3.1.  General. Mission Qualification Training (MQT) is a unit developed training program that upgradesnewly assigned pilots to BMC or CMR to accomplish the unit mission. Guidance in this chapter is pro-vided to assist the SQ/CCs in developing their MQT program. The SQ/CC is responsible for developingthe unit specific MQT program and the OG/CC will approve for use. Units are allowed to further tailortheir program for all pilots, based on current qualification, experience, currency, documented perfor-mance, and formal training. Applicable portions of MQT may be used to create a re-qualification programfor pilots who have regressed from BMC or CMR, to specifically address deficiencies which causedregression. 3.1.1.  MQT will be completed within 90 calendar days (ANG: 120 calendar days). Timing starts atthe pilot's first duty day at the gaining operational unit. If a pilot elects to take leave prior to enteringMQT, the timing will begin after the termination of the pilot's leave. Training is complete upon SQ/CC certification to CMR/BMC. Notify MAJCOM/A3T if delay beginning MQT due to security clear-ance exceeds 30 days. If training exceeds the specified limit, units will notify MAJCOM/A3 (ANG:ACC/A3G). 3.1.2.  The following CMR/BMC training items are granted grace periods for completion after MQT;failure to comply will result in regression to N-CMR/N-BMC until training is complete. AAR andnight training accomplished in IQT may fulfill MQT requirements as determined by the SQ/CC. NightMQT may be flown with NVGs if the upgrading pilot is already NVG qualified. Night MQT may becombined with the NVG upgrade. All night training requires demonstrated proficiency and currencyin similar day events, unless accomplished dual with an IP. Unaccomplished AAR and night trainingwill be accomplished NLT 90 days (ANG: 180 days) from completion of MQT. 3.1.3.  Pilots in MQT will not fly in Flag FLAG-level exercises, or WSEP. The OG/ CC will determineMQT participation in other exercises. 3.1.4.  The night training in MQT will satisfy any unaccomplished night training requirement fromIQT. If night training was accomplished in IQT, the SQ/CC may certify pilots to BMC/CMR withoutnight MQT as long as it is subsequently accomplished prior to night training. Night MQT may beflown with NVGs if the upgrading pilot is already NVG qualified. Night MQT may be combined withthe NVG upgrade. All night training requires demonstrated proficiency and currency in similar dayevents. 3.1.5.  Prior to CMR certification, if not accomplished during FTU training, pilots must complete lowaltitude step-down training (LASDT) category (CAT) I training and initially qualify in all weaponsdelivery/employment events required QUAL at CMR/BMC. 3.2.  Ground Training:  3.2.1.  Units will develop blocks of instruction covering areas pertinent to their mission as determinedby the SQ/CC. Training accomplished during IQT may be credited towards this requirement. 3.2.2.  Pilots transferring from another MAJCOM require the theater-specific portions of instrumentrefresher course (IRC) before flying without a theater-experienced pilot in the formation. MQT aca-demics and the MQT local area orientation (LAO) mission may satisfy this requirement. 18AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 20063.2.3.  Initial Verification: Initial verification will be completed within 90 days (ANG: 180 days)after completing MQT. Suggested briefing guide is at Attachment 3. Each pilot (not required forBMC) will demonstrate to a formal board a satisfactory knowledge of the squadron’s assigned mis-sion. Board composition will be established by the SQ/CC. Desired composition is SQ/CC or SQ/DO(chairman), weapons, electronic combat, intelligence, and plans representatives. 3.3.  Simulator (SIM) Training:  3.3.1.  FMTs will be used on SIM MQT-1 thru -8 if available. If unavailable, SIM MQT rides may beaccomplished at the ACS or in the WTT. MQT pilots should fly the missions outlined below. Eachtraining device mission will include selected emergency procedures and unusual attitude/inadvertentweather entry procedures.

Practice 4-ship tactical operations on an OCA sortie(SQ/CC discretion on exact scenario). 3.4.  Flying Training. The appropriate missions from those listed below will be used to upgrade to BMCand CMR. Unit-developed MQT programs should use profiles typical of squadron missions. The simula-tor profiles above should be adjusted and flown as pre-requisites for the sorties. 3.4.1.  Supervision. A FL-qualified SQ supervisor or IP in the element is required unless specifiedotherwise. On some sorties, more specific guidance is provided. The SQ/CC will determine the properflight position of the supervisor/IP unless specified otherwise. 3.4.2.  If more than 14 calendar days elapse between sorties, an additional review sortie will be flownbefore continuing in the program. 3.4.3.  All pilots must conduct practice airborne emergency procedures training during any one of theMQT sorties. As a minimum, the training will consist of briefing, flying, and debriefing a simulatedcritical action procedures scenario per each phase of flight. 3.4.4.  Sortie Requirements. The LAO/AHC/Instrument mission is mandatory. The Mission Evalua-tion Checkride, flown IAW AFI 11-202V2, (AFI 11-2F-22AV2) is also mandatory.

Low Altitude Step-Down Training (LASDT):  3.4.6.1.  To conduct low altitude operations safely, pilots need to be knowledgeable of aircraft han-dling and performance characteristics, tactical formation, intercept, offensive maneuvering anddefensive reactions, and navigation. The low altitude environment requires a well-supervisedLASDT program, including initial certification and currency requirements. LASDT qualifiespilots to conduct low altitude training (LOWAT) at or below 1,000 feet AGL. LOWAT block/cate-gory certification is required in a low altitude block prior to performing unsupervised operationsin that low altitude block. 3.4.6.2.  Category 1 is listed in Table 3.1., and there is no requirement to progress beyond Cate-gory I. The training program is based on instructor/Squadron supervisor assessment of pilot per-formance, TR compliance, and judgment. LASDT missions will be supervised by an IP orFL-qualified squadron supervisor who has completed LASDT training and is current. Table 3.1.  LOWAT Categories. Category I Altitude Block 1,000-500 Upgrade Sorties To Certify LASDT 1, LASDT 2, LASDT 3 3.4.6.3.  Demonstrated proficiency down to 500 feet AGL is required for Category I qualificationand is normally accomplished during IQT and/or MQT. SQ/CC may accept a transfer pilot'sLOWAT qualification from previous IQT or MQT. Category I qualification is a minimum require-ment for CMR status. 3.4.6.4.  Entry into LASDT (other than at FTU) requires SQ/CC approval. The altitude to which apilot is certified is determined by the SQ/CC and based on the lowest altitude at which all taskscan be comfortably performed and proficiency demonstrated. The goal is proficiency down to the22AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 2006minimum altitude compatible with squadron mission. Upon successful completion of LASDTtraining, the SQ/CC will certify the pilot to LASDT category I. Squadrons may accept docu-mented LASDT certification for pilots coming from other units/ commands. With SQ/CCapproval, low altitude training conducted at a formal course may be used to fulfill applicablerequirements of this paragraph. 3.4.6.5.  LASDT will be scheduled and briefed as a primary portion of the mission. CompatibleRAP CT sorties and events may be accomplished in conjunction with LASDT as long as theobjectives of LASDT training are met. LASDT training will not be accomplished on an alternatemission. IPs/FLs must be aware of the added stress and task loading associated with low altitudeoperations and provide breaks in training above the training altitude. Develop training profiles toavoid over-tasking the upgrading pilot, and upgrade sortie continuity should be emphasized. 3.4.6.6.  TR’s will be IAW AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures; and AFI11-2F-22AV3, F-22A--Operations Procedures. During LASDT, KIOs will include a climb toabove 1000 feet AGL. 3.4.6.7.  An IP or squadron supervisor, in the element, will supervise all sorties. 3.4.6.8.  Ground Training. LASDT training. Coverage should support the mission and conceptof operations of the squadron, incorporating appropriate portions of AFTTP 3-1V12, and AFFTP3-3.12. Complete all academic training prior to flight training/briefing. 3.4.6.8.1.  AHC. Discuss aircraft performance as it applies to the low altitude environment, toinclude: control response (low/high speed, speed brake use); afterburner (fuel considerations,selection techniques), acceleration/ deceleration, level turns, vertical maneuvering, climb/dive/slice, recoveries, effects of gross weight, power settings, density altitude, G-loading, andbank angles; terrain avoidance (ridge crossings), Head Up Display (HUD) use, terrain clear-ance versus turning room, dangers inherent in over-banking during turns, importance of fre-quent cross check of aircraft attitude relative to horizon; and the videotape "How Low CanYou Go?" 3.4.6.8.2.  Environmental Factors. Discuss out-of-cockpit visibility and Field of View(FOV) restrictions, sun angle, terrain and G-excess-illusions/perceptions, Weather (WX) con-siderations and the importance of relaying WX information to the weather flight, and use ofthe HUD. 3.4.6.8.3.  Task Management. Discuss low altitude tasks and task management/prioritizationconcept. 3.4.6.8.4.  Low Altitude Tactical Formation (LATF). Discuss formations, hazards at lowaltitudes, task prioritization, tactical turns, visual lookout/ mutual support. 3.4.6.8.5.  Defensive Reactions.

Initial Aircrew Chemical Defense Training (ACDT). (N/A for CB/TF-coded and ANG ADFunits) Is designed to ensure pilot proficiency in the overall use of the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensem-ble (ACDE) and to familiarize pilots with combat capabilities while wearing ACDE. Pilots must completeInitial ACDT NLT 90 days (ANG: 180 days) from MQT completion. Initial ACDT affects CMR/BMC,but is non-grounding. All initial ACDT is to be accomplished prior to the first ACDE flight. Pilots will beACDE certified upon the completion of initial ACDT. Pilots who accomplished initial ACDT in previoustours in a fighter type MDS are not required to reaccomplish the ACDE Flight. 3.5.1.  Ground Training. Aircrew Chemical Defense Training/ACDT (LL04) initial and CTrefresher thereafter. Egress Training with ACDE (LL05) IAW AFI 11-301, and Emergency ParachuteTraining with ACDE IAW AFI 16-1301-will be accomplished once in a career (per MDS). 3.5.2.  Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE) SIM. A SIM mission in full ACDE gear(anti-exposure suit liner may be substituted), harness, and G-suit. Within the mission profile, practicedoffing simulated contaminated equipment. An ACDE SIM mission may use existing SIM missionprofiles and count toward TAC SIM training cycle requirements. Units will use their best availablesimulator or actual aircraft cockpit for ACDE SIM training. The ACDE SIM will be accomplishedonce in a career (per MDS), and should be conducted as close as possible to the day before (but notmore than 30 days prior) to the ACDE flight. 3.5.3.  Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE) Flight. The ACDE flight will be accom-plished once in a career (unless previously accomplished in a fighter type MDS). Flight training mustconsider limitations of operating while wearing ACDE. Full donning and doffing procedures/sequence will be practiced in conjunction with the ACDE flight but the only ACDE worn in-flight willbe mask, filter pack, and gloves. 3.5.4.  ACDE Flight Restrictions:  3.5.4.1.  Pilots will be fully current and qualified in an event prior to accomplishing that event onan ACDE flight. 3.5.4.2.  Minimum formation spacing is route unless fingertip is required for safe mission accom-plishment (i.e., WX penetration). 3.5.4.3.  Minimum altitude is 500 feet AGL except takeoffs, approaches and landings. 3.5.4.4.  No ACBT or night sorties. AAR requires an IP in the flight. 3.5.4.5.  Weather minimums are 1,500 feet ceiling and 3 miles (4.8 km) visibility for pilots wear-ing ACDE. 3.5.4.6.  Solo operations will be supervised by an ACDE qualified FL from a chase position. For-mations, to include chase, are limited to two-ship and only one pilot in the element will be wearingACDE. Pilots wearing ACDE gear will not fly in dissimilar formations. 3.5.4.7.  Operations supervision should not conduct ACDE flight training when, in their judgment,temperature/dew point conditions are not favorable to safe operations. AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 200625Chapter 4   CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  General. This chapter and the current F-22A RAP tasking memo , outlines ground and flying train-ing requirements for CMR, BMC, and BAQ pilots. Pilots must be qualified IAW AFI 11-11-202V1 andAFI 11-11-202V2. Additionally, they must complete IQT to fly in BAQ status, and MQT or FTU IPupgrade to fly in BMC status. 4.2.  Ground Training. Pilots will accomplish ground training IAW the RAP Tasking memo and Table4.1. The table is a single-source reference for MDS-specific ground training only and does not includenon-MDS-specific ancillary training. Waiver authority for each event is IAW the specified referencedirective. Where discrepancies exist, the reference directive takes precedence. Units may credit groundtraining accomplished during IQT/MQT toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it wasaccomplished. . 4.2.1.  Simulator (SIM): Virtual Warfighting System (ViWS), Full Mission Trainer (FMT), AirCombat Simulator (ACS), Weapons and Tactics Trainer (WTT). 4.2.1.1.  Table 4.2. As applicable, depicts the minimum SIM training requirements. SQ/CC willdetermine the minimum number/type of training device continuation training (CT) missions thatrequire supervision. Units should determine additional CT training device supervision require-ments based on expected employment tasking, training device capabilities, and mission trainingobjectives. 4.2.1.2.  Units will develop scenarios that cover all critical action and precision instrument proce-dures, and will develop other scenario requirements based on expected employment tasking andtraining device capabilities. Emphasis should be placed on training not readily attainable duringdaily flying activities. Units will review scenarios annually and update as required. 4.2.1.3.  Unusual attitude and inadvertent weather entry procedures training and low altitudeunusual attitude recovery training will be accomplished during all Aircrew Training Device (ATD)training. Unusual attitude training will include recognition of HUD limitations, non-HUD recov-eries and use of the Standby Flight group. 4.2.1.3.1.  During EP ViWS/FMT/WTT/ACS missions, departure recognition and recoveryprocedures will be accomplished to include both High AOA, and out-of-control situations. 4.2.1.4.  Pilots may receive credit for training accomplished in special devices such as the AirCombat Simulator (ACS), or HHQ-directed simulator test support, etc., if approved by the SQ/CC. 4.2.1.5.  Tactical missions may be accomplished in either the MTC or FMT/WTT. EP missionswill be accomplished in the MTC or FMT. If a unit does not have access to an MTC or FMT, EPmissions will be accomplished in the WTT. 4.2.2.  Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT).  4.2.2.1.  This training is not an evaluation, but a review of abnormal/emergency procedures andaircraft systems operations/limitations during realistic scenarios. One pilot should present a situa-tion and another discusses actions necessary to cope with the malfunction and carry it to a logical26AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 2006conclusion. Critical action/Boldface procedures (if applicable) and squadron special interest itemsshould be emphasized. Incorporate the following elements into squadron SEPT training programs: 4.2.2.1.1.  SQ/CC/DO involvement in the selection of a monthly SEPT topic. 4.2.2.1.2.  Develop SEPT scenarios using F-22A mishaps/incidents as baseline cases. 4.2.2.1.3.  Discuss at least one EP for each major subsystem (engine, FLCS, IVSC, APU, elec-trical, hydraulic and fuel) in each session. The EPs should also span all phases of flight. 4.2.2.1.4.  Accomplish two SEPTs each training cycle with an IP or SQ supervisor to includeminimum fuel and emergency divert training. 4.2.2.2.  The intent of SEPT training is that each pilot accomplishes an SEPT in the month they areflying. SEPT training will be accomplished each calendar month, and the currency will expire atthe end of the following month. Failure to accomplish by the end of the month will result ingrounding until subsequently completed. 4.2.2.3.  SEPTs will be accomplished in a FMT or WTT, if available. If a FMT/WTT is not avail-able, SEPTs should be accomplished one-on-one, but small flight-sized groups are allowable inorder that all members participate to the full extent and share equal time responding to emergencysituations. 4.2.2.4.  Completion of a simulator EP profile satisfies the monthly SEPT requirement. For IP/ FEadministering the SEPT/EP Sim will satisfy their SEPT requirement. 4.2.2.5.  Formal course student SEPTs may satisfy the monthly SEPT requirement for the IP whomadministers this training. 4.2.3.  Ground training will be IAW Table 4.1. See RAP tasking memo. 4.2.4.  Weapons/Tactics Academic Training. Units will establish a weapons/ tactics academic train-ing program to satisfy MQT and CT requirements. Training is required in each training cycle. Audio-visual programs may be used in place of academic instruction. The program will require successfulcompletion of an examination (85 percent minimum to pass). Use testing to validate qualification tothe maximum extent possible throughout the training program. Pilots successfully scoring 85 percentor greater may be given training credit in lieu of ground CT, where authorized by the governing pub-lication. 4.2.4.1.  Academic instructors should be USAFWS graduates or have attended the applicable aca-demic portion(s) of school, if possible. 4.2.4.2.  Instruction and tests should include (as applicable), but are not limited to: 4.2.4.2.1.  Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground weapons description, operation, parameters, fusing,limitations, preflight, tactics, normal and emergency procedures/techniques. 4.2.4.2.2.  ACBT.

Overdue training requirements must be satisfied before the pilot is considered qualified toperform tasks applicable to the type of training in which delinquent. Training annotated as affect-ing CMR status will require regression to N-CMR until appropriate training as specified by SQ/CC is accomplished. Training identified as not affecting CMR status does not require regressionfrom CMR although it may result in grounding until training is completed (e.g., life support train-ing). The duration of grounding and status of sortie lookback will determine the effect on CMRstatus. 4.6.2.2.  Unless otherwise specified, supervisory requirements pertaining to recurrency may besatisfied in the cockpit or flight position that offers the best control of the mission, as determinedby the SQ/CC. 4.6.3.  MAJCOM/AOS Currency Requirements. Units will comply with AFI 11-207, Combat Air-craft Delivery, for additional currencies required for the flight delivery of aircraft coordinated throughMAJCOM/AOS. 4.6.4.  Landing/Sortie Recurrency:  4.6.4.1.  Loss of landing/sortie currency requires the following action (timing starts from the lastlanding): 4.6.4.1.1.  31-90 Days (46-90 Days - Experienced). Regain landing currency. 4.6.4.1.2.  91-135 Days. Same as above, plus instructor supervised SIM (tactics, normal andemergency procedures for CMR pilots; normal, instrument, and emergency procedures forBMC pilots). AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 2006354.6.4.1.3.  136-210 Days (225 – Experienced) .

IQT, landing recurrency,LASDT re-qualification, and appropriate weapons event initial qualification. 4.6.5.  ACBT Recurrency: 4.6.5.1.  Pilots losing currency in ACBT must accomplish the following sorties: 4.6.5.1.1.  61-90 Days (91-120 Experienced). AHC and WVR manuevering. 4.6.5.1.2.  91-180 Days (121-180 Experienced). AHC, and WVR manuevering. 4.6.5.1.3.  Over 180 Days. Re-accomplish a tailored program IAW Chapter 3. 4.6.6.  Loss of/Re-qualification to IP Status. IPs will be decertified if: 4.6.6.1.  Failure of a Flight Check. To regain IP status, the IP must successfully complete a flightcheck IAW AFI 11-202V2 (AFI 11-2F-22AV2). 4.6.6.2.  Expiration of IP currency: To regain status, see Table 4.3. 4.6.6.3.  Loss of CMR/BMC status due to loss of currency in an event/sortie and the SQ/CC deemsdecertification is required. If the SQ/CC does not elect this option or if the instructor becomesnon-current in events/sorties that do not require removal from CMR/BMC status, instructor statusmay be retained, but the IP will not instruct in that event/sortie until the required currency isregained. 4.6.7.  NVG Demanding Mission Re-currency. Pilots losing NVG demanding mission currencymust accomplish the following events prior to unrestricted night operations: 4.6.7.1.  2-ship basic formation work / light drills and unit specific mission elements. 4.6.7.2.

Only RAP training and ContingencyOperations sorties may be used for lookback. If a pilot does not meet lookback requirements through-out the training cycle, SQ/CCs can either regress the pilot to N-CMR/N-BMC status, as applicable;remove the pilot from an CMR manning position; or initiate action to remove the pilot from active fly-ing status. 4.7.1.1.  Failure to meet 1-month RAP/Contingency Operations sortie lookback requires a reviewof the pilot's 3-month sortie history. If the 3-month lookback has been met, the pilot may, at SQ/CC discretion, remain CMR/BMC. Failure to meet the 3-month lookback will result in regressionto N-CMR/N-BMC status as appropriate, or the pilot may be placed in probation status for 1month at the SQ/CC's discretion. If probation is chosen, the only way to remove a pilot from pro-bation and preserve the current status is to re-establish a 1-month lookback at the end of the pro-bation period (see Figure 4.1.). 4.7.1.2.  CMR/BMC pilots regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC for lookback, must complete a SQ/CCapproved re-certification program to return the pilot to CMR/BMC standards. Upon completion ofthe re-certification program, the CMR/BMC pilots must also meet 1-month lookback requirementprior to reclaiming CMR/BMC status. The sorties and events accomplished during the re-certifi-cation program may be credited towards their total/type sortie and event requirements for thetraining cycle as well as for their monthly sortie requirement. 4.7.1.3.  Lookback computations begin following completion of MQT. The aircrew must maintain1-month lookback until 3-month lookback is established. SQ/CCs may apply probation rules asdescribed in paragraph 4.7.1.1. if a new CMR/BMC pilot fails to meet 1-month lookback whileestablishing 3-month lookback. In addition, 1-month lookback will start the first full month ofCMR/BMC status. 4.7.2.  Regression for Weapons Qualification. Failure to maintain RAP tasked weapons qualifica-tion at the end of the training cycle will require: 4.7.2.1.  For Events Tasked as Qual at CMR/BMC. Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC. To regainCMR/BMC, the pilot must re-achieve initial qualification in the deficient weapons event (seeparagraph 5.2.). Events accomplished for this initial qualification may count toward the cumula-tive CT event qualification required at the end of the training cycle. 4.7.2.2.  For Events Tasked as FAM at CMR/BMC, Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC. Toregain CMR/BMC, the pilot must accomplish at least three of the weapons deliveries under thesupervision of a squadron supervisor or instructor. Events accomplished for this initial qualifica-tion may count toward the cumulative CT event qualification required at the end of the next train-ing cycle. 4.7.3.  Pilots who fail an aircraft qualification, mission, or instrument evaluation will be handled IAWAFI 11-202V2 (AFI 11-2F-22AV2). Pilots will regress to N-CMR/N-BMC as applicable. These pilotswill remain N-CMR/N-BMC until successfully completing required corrective action, a re-evaluation,and are re-certified by the SQ/CC. 38AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 20064.8.  End of Cycle Requirements.  Pilots who fail to complete sortie and/or event requirements of this volume by the end of the training cyclemay require additional training depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency. Refer to para-graph 4.9. to see if some of these requirements can be prorated. In all cases, report training shortfalls IAWparagraph 1.12. 4.8.1.  Pilots that fail to meet the total RAP sortie requirement may continue CT at CMR/BMC asdetermined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if additional training is required. 4.8.2.  Pilots that fail to meet non-RAP sortie and/or event requirements may continue CT at CMR/BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if additional training is required. 4.8.3.  Failure to meet RAP Sortie Type Requirements will result in one of the following: 4.8.3.1.  Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC if the SQ/CC determines that the sortie type deficiency issignificant. To regain CMR/BMC, the aircrew will complete all deficient sortie types. These sor-ties may be counted against the total requirements for the new training cycle. 4.8.3.2.  Continuation at CMR/BMC if total RAP sorties and lookback are maintained and the sor-tie type deficiencies are deemed insignificant by the SQ/CC. 4.8.4.  Failure to accomplish sorties required for Special Capabilities/Qualifications will result in lossof that qualification. The SQ/CC will determine re-qualification requirements. 4.9.  Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC may prorateall training requirements when DNIFs, emergency leaves, Consecutive Overseas Tour (COT) leaves,non-flying TDY/exercises (ANG: and or mandatory training required by civilian employment), combat/contingency deployments, preclude training for a portion of the training period. Normal leave will not beconsidered as non-availability. Extended bad weather, which precludes the unit from flying for more than15 consecutive days maybe considered as non-availability. (ANG: End-of-cycle proration is permitted fordocumented attrition (i.e. HHQ or weather cancels, MNDs, ground or air aborts) in monthly incrementswhen the total number of occurrences ranges from one half to one times the individual’s normal monthlyrate of flying). The following guidelines apply: 4.9.1.  Proration will only be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-availability, notto mask training or planning deficiencies. 4.9.2.  Proration is based on cumulative days of training non-availability in the training cycle. UseTable 4.4. to determine the number of months to be prorated based on the cumulative calendar days oftraining non-availability. 4.9.3.  If IQT or MQT is re-accomplished, a pilot's training cycle will start over at a prorated share fol-lowing completion of IQT/MQT training. AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 200639Table 4.4.  Proration Allowance.

Example: Capt Jones was granted 17 days of emergency leave in January and attended SOS inresidence from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days. His SQ/CC authorized a totalof two months proration from his training cycle (two months for the 73 cumulative days of non-avail-ability for flying). (ANG: Maj Jang is an experienced CMR pilot with a normal monthly requirementof 6 sorties. He had eight attrition occurences throughout the training cycle, therefore his SQ/CC canprorate one month of Maj Jang’s training requirements). 4.9.5.  Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the next lower wholenumber, but no requirement may be prorated below one. 4.9.6.  Newly assigned/converted pilots and pilots achieving CMR/BMC after the 15th of the monthare considered to be in CT on the first day of the following month for proration purposes. Events andsorties for the remainder of the training cycle may be prorated. A prorated share of RAP sorties mustbe completed in CT. 40AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 20064.9.7.  Night, TDU-32 A/B (Banner), and AAR requirements accomplished during MQT may be cred-ited toward prorated CT requirements if accomplished during the cycle in which the pilot wasdeclared CMR/BMC, unless specified otherwise by MAJCOM. 4.9.8.  A pilot's last month on station prior to departing PCS may be prorated provided 1 month's pro-ration is not exceeded. Individuals departing PCS may be considered CMR for reporting purposesduring a period of 60 days from date of last flight, or until loss of CMR currency, port call date, or signin at new duty station which ever occurs first. 4.9.9.  CMR pilots who attend F-22A USAFWS in TDY-and-return status may be reported throughoutthe TDY as CMR. Upon return, those pilots will accomplish a prorated share of sortie/event require-ments (see Table 4.4.). 4.9.10.  Contingency Operations. Contingency operations can have a positive or negative impact ona unit's CT program, as emphasis is on supporting the actual contingency. A potential lack of trainingopportunities while supporting contingency operations can place a burden on the unit, forcing it toaccomplish the majority of its CT program in a reduced period of time or with reduced assets. The fol-lowing proration procedures are intended to provide flexibility in accomplishing the unit's CT pro-gram. 4.9.10.1.  All sorties flown during contingency operations may be logged as contingency opera-tions sorties. If adequate training was accomplished during the sortie, it can be logged as a RAPsortie. Contingency sorties do not count toward RAP requirements, but may be used for lookbackpurposes. When logging a contingency sortie, AAR, CHAFF, FLARE, HAVE QUICK, andSECURE VOICE, may count against RAP requirements and may be used to update currencies.All other events will not count toward RAP requirements, but may be used to update currency.Upon relief from contingency operations, units will prorate RAP sorties and events for the periodof time each individual was tasked. In addition, proration is authorized for the deployment prepa-ration and deployment recovery time where home station flying is reduced by the MAJCOM. 4.9.10.1.1.  For ANG units, individuals deployed for more than a seven day period may proratea one month portion of RAP sorties and events. 4.9.10.2.  As the training quality of missions flown at contingency locations may vary consider-ably, OG/CCs are authorized to allow sorties that provided valid training to be logged as RAP sor-ties. Events accomplished on these sorties count toward RAP event requirements, and thesesorties/events may not be prorated. 4.9.10.2.1.  Upon release from contingency operations, proration is computed by calculatingthe sorties to be prorated for the entire deployment, and then subtracting the number of validRAP sorties as authorized by the OG/CC. The result is the allowable sortie proration. Negativenumbers equate to zero. Events will be prorated at SQ/CC discretion based on the eventsaccomplished during valid RAP sorties. 4.10.  Regaining CMR/BMC Status:  4.10.1.  If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet the end of cycle weapons qualifications and/or event requirements, re-qualification is IAW paragraph 4.7. 4.10.2.  If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph 4.7., the followingapplies (timing starts from the date the pilot came off CMR/BMC status): AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 2006414.10.2.1.  Up to 90 Days. The pilot must complete SQ/CC directed re-certification program inaccordance with paragraph 4.7.1.2. In addition, all RAP event currencies must be regained. TheSQ/CC will approve any other additional training prior to re-certification to CMR. 4.10.2.2.  91-180 Days. Same as above, plus qualification and tactical written examinations. 4.10.2.3.  181 Days and Beyond. Re-accomplish MQT. 4.11.  Example of the Lookback, Regression, Proration, and Re-Qualification Process:  4.11.1.  Capt Smith is an experienced CMR pilot in ACC with a 1 and 3 month lookback requirementof 9 and 24 RAP sorties respectively. On Feb 3, he flew an ACBT sortie prior to departing for anon-flying TDY staff tour for two months. He reported back for flight duty on 6 Apr. What is his sta-tus throughout his TDY and on his return? 4.11.1.1.  The SQ/CC wanted to list Capt Smith as a countable CMR pilot for reporting purposesthroughout the TDY. Therefore, on 1 Mar, his Flt/CC performed the mandatory 1 month lookback(Feb) on Capt Smith. He only flew 1 RAP sortie, failing the 1 month lookback. The Flt/CC thenperformed a 3 month lookback (Dec, Jan, Feb). This showed that he flew only 20 sorties for thisperiod. Had he flown four more sorties, his SQ/CC could continue Capt Smith at CMR. However,with 20 sorties, Capt Smith did not meet the 3 month lookback for a CMR pilot. 4.11.1.2.  The SQ/CC decided to carry Capt Smith on 1-month probation. On 1 Apr, Capt Smith's1 month-lookback (Mar) was 0 sorties. The SQ/CC must now regress Capt Smith to N-CMR.When Capt Smith returns, the SQ/CC will have to place him in a re-certification program. Uponcompleting this program, Capt Smith will need to re-establish his 1-month lookback by 1 May.Failing to do so would force him to be reported N-CMR for an additional month until the nextlookback process on 1 June. 4.11.1.3.  If he had returned on 22 Mar, and had last landed the jet 48 days ago, he could fly anon-demanding sortie to regain demanding sortie and landing currency. For CMR purposes, CaptSmith would need to fly 9 RAP sorties to recapture his 1-month lookback and get off probation.Although Capt Smith was still CMR in Mar, the SQ/CC flew him with an IP on his first few sortiesin order to regain his landing, AAR, LOWAT, and Formation Takeoff (T/O) and Landing curren-cies. 4.11.1.4.  At the end of the training cycle on 30 Jun, the SQ/CC prorated 2 months off of CaptSmith's total requirements. In spite of this proration, Capt Smith was deficient in one RAP sortiecategory The SQ/CC could regress Capt Smith to N-CMR, if deemed significant. After accom-plishing the tailored re-certification program (the deficient sorties), the SQ/CC would re-certifyCapt Smith to CMR. This training counts for the new training cycle. 4.12.  Instruments. Develop an instrument training program to ensure instrument proficiency includinglost wingman training, briefings on how to recognize and deal with spatial disorientation, HUD-offunusual attitude recoveries, and transition from visual to instrument conditions. It will also stress the useof primary flight instrument (HUD) and standby flight group instruments during instrument recoveryfrom unusual attitudes or spatial disorientation. 4.12.1.  Units which seldom encounter bad weather and/or night recoveries should exercise pilot andapproach facilities by periodically simulating "weather day" recovery operations, as determined bythe SQ/CC. 42AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 20064.12.2.  Pilots transferring from another theater require the theater-specific portions of IRC before fly-ing. MQT that include theater-specific portions of IRC academics and the MQT LAO mission maysatisfy this requirement. 4.12.3.  Pilots may accomplish RAP events on an instrument sortie provided accomplishment does notinterfere with the primary goal of instrument training. Pilots should practice the transition from instru-ments to visual references on all instrument approaches. Instrument sorties are Non-RAP require-ments and will be logged as such. Units are allocated sorties for every pilot to accomplish theirminimum Non-RAP requirements. 4.12.4.  Pilots will accomplish spatial disorientation events in the FMT per Table 4.2.. 4.13.  G-Awareness Continuation Training.  Units will develop a CT program that provides feedback to pilots and imprints a proper AGSM so that itbecomes an integral part of pulling Gs. 4.13.1.  The basis of this program is to give each FL, SQ supervisor, aerospace physiologist and flightsurgeon the skills needed to evaluate a flight member's DVR to ensure a proper AGSM is being per-formed. This program also makes assessment of the AGSM a normal debrief item after every flight.The assessment should be done as a normal part of DVR assessment while reviewing other tacticalportions of the mission. 4.13.2.  Use the following minimum guidance to implement the unit's program: 4.13.2.1.  Incorporate AGSM technique and assessment into FLUG, IPUG, and squadron CT pro-gram. Place emphasis on briefing, debriefing, and assessing the AGSM using the DVR in thedebrief on a daily basis. FLs, IPs, SQ supervisors, Aerospace Physiologists and flight surgeonsshould become adept at assessing and teaching the correct AGSM. The approved instructionalvideo covering AGSM technique, reinforcement, and assessment, or Anti-G strain technique ace-ademics will be presented annually by a qualified physiologists, flight surgeon, or IP squadronsupervisor to all pilots as part of weapons academics. Academics will include a discussion of thelimitations imposed on aircraft performance as a result of an ineffective AGSM. 4.13.2.2.  Units will include "AGSM effectiveness" on MQT and "AGSM assessment" on FLUGand IPUG grade sheets. Evaluate these areas during sorties where more than five Gs are pulled. 4.13.2.3.  Fly the tactical portion of all basic missions in hot mic to enable assessment of theAGSM. Set intercom volumes at a level which is comfortable for the pilot but still allows assess-ment of breathing and AGSM technique in the debrief For high task sorties it is highly desired forpilots to fly in hot mic. The purpose of this is to identify breakdowns in the AGSM which com-monly occur during high task portions of a mission. 4.13.2.4.  Film G-awareness exercises in hot mic. The second turn of the G-awareness exercisewill be a minimum of 180 degrees of turn. 4.13.2.5.  FLs will emphasize G-awareness when appropriate during the flight briefing. 4.13.2.6.  FLs will assess the AGSM effectiveness of flight members during mission debriefings.This assessment should not be limited to the G-awareness exercise. Evaluate the AGSM after thepilot has had the time to fatigue, to get an accurate assessment of a pilot's AGSM during a tacti-AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 200643cally and G-demanding portion of flight. AGSM should also be evaluated under relatively lowintensity G. 4.13.3.  FLs or SQ supervisors will identify pilots having poor AGSM technique or low G-tolerance tothe Flt/CC or appropriate operations supervisor. The SQ/DO or appropriate operations supervisor willdetermine what action is required to improve the pilot's G-tolerance. The SQ/CC will determine ifCommander-Directed Acceleration Training is required IAW AFI 11-404, Centrifuge Training forHigh-G Aircrew. 4.13.4.  The squadron will develop a program to ensure an A/A mission tape for each pilot is reviewedeach training cycle by an aerospace physiologist or squadron flight surgeon and documented. Asquadron supervisor will review the documentation. If an aerospace physiologist or squadron flightsurgeon are not available, a squadron supervisor will review the tape and document appropriately. 4.14.  Low/Slow Speed EID/VID Procedures:  4.14.1.  For units specifically tasked to perform the Homeland Security mission or counter drug role,comply with current approved guidance. 4.14.2.  For all other units, the objective of this low/slow EID/VID training is to expose pilots to prob-lems associated with intercepting low/slow flying aircraft (rotary and fixed wing) for visual identifica-tion practice in a threat environment. Emphasis should be placed on dissimilar adversaries below 2000feet AGL and 200 KIAS (helicopters are desired). Training will be conducted IAW AFTTP 3-1, AFI11-2F-22AV3, and AFI 11-214. 4.14.2.1.  Unit developed ground training programs will be designed for unit specific equipageand employment taskings. Academic sessions should be conducted during weapons and tacticstraining and maximum use of the visual recognition program is encouraged. 4.14.2.2.  Flying training missions should, to the maximum extent possible, include USAF heli-copters, USN helicopters, USA helicopters, and propeller aircraft. Creation of a realistic environ-ment to stimulate the aircraft EID/VID suite is essential to the conduct of low/slow VIDprocedures. Units must make every effort to maximize effective use of limited assets as well as toinstill awareness and actions appropriate to this training. SQ/CC's will determine the depth ofground and flying training necessary prior to participating in exercises and contingency opera-tions. 44AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 2006Chapter 5   WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT QUALIFICATION 5.1.  General. This chapter outlines requirements for the initial qualification to employ weapons(AIM-120, AIM-9, GUN and GBU-32) and the requirements to maintain qualification in weaponsemployment during Continuation Training. Refer to Attachment 2 for further guidance in weaponsevents. 5.2.  Initial Qualification:  5.2.1.  Pilots must accomplish initial qualification in any weapons event requiring qualification atCMR/BMC. Initial qualification achieved in IQT or MQT satisfies requirements for CT initial quali-fication, but not for CT event requirements. Initial qualification will carry over for consecutive toursin the F-22A. Initial missile employment qualification is evaluated on the mission qualification checkride and is achieved by meeting the "qualified" criteria for weapons employment IAW AFI11-2F-22AV2. Qualification in one missile category is assumed for other missile categories in suchcases where only one type of missile was employed. 5.2.2.  Initial gun employment qualification is achieved by scoring an individual hit during a live firepass on a AGTS/Banner (as applicable) target. A hit is one bullet impact on the AGTS/Banner (asapplicable). For initial qualification use any Banner pattern as defined in (AFI 11-214). If AGTS/Ban-ner (as applicable) are not available, gun qualification may be accomplished via DVR assessment. 5.2.3.  If not otherwise specified, initial qualification in a weapons event is satisfied when the pilot hasachieved a minimum of 3 hits out of 6 consecutive record deliveries. Scoring shall be accomplishedby ground, air, or DVR scoring as approprate. 5.2.4.  The initial qualification satisfies weapons qualification requirements until the end of the cur-rent training period. 5.3.  CT Qualification:  5.3.1.  During CT each pilot's weapons employment will be assessed for validity IAW AFTTP 3-1 cri-teria and the results in each category (AIM-120, AIM-9, GUN and GBU-32) will be recorded for thecurrent training period for RAP required tasks. Qualification in weapons employment is maintainedby achieving a 75 percent valid at pickle rate for AIM-120/9 and 75 percent valid attempt at triggersqueeze for gun. This qualification is valid throughout the next training period. 5.3.2.  To maintain AGTS/Banner (as applicable) qualification, pilots will use basic or tactical patternsas defined in AFI 11-214 and must achieve a hit. 5.3.3.  Unless otherwise specified, GBU-32 qualification criteria is 20 record hits and an overallrecord hit rate of 85 percent. 5.4.  Failure to Qualify:  5.4.1.  If qualification is required at CMR/BMC, failure to qualify will result in regression to N-CMR/N-BMC and entered into re-certification until re-qualification is accomplished. AFI11-2F-22AV1   19 MAY 2006455.4.2.  AGTS/Banner (as applicable) re-qualification requires an individual hit IAW hit criteria inparagraph 5.3. above. Re-qualification may be accomplished using basic or tactical patterns. If AGTS/Banner (as applicable) are not available, gun re-qualification may be accomplished via DVR assess-ment. 5.4.3.

OG/CCs are responsible for ensuring all participating pilots are ready to deploy and are profi-cient to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking. 6.8.  Contingency/Exercise Spin-up Training. This training will be conducted prior to support of con-tingency operations (if time permits) or exercises. The objective of this training is to ensure the pilot'sability to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking. For contingency operations, units areresponsible for contacting appropriate gaining command/operations to determine expected mission task-ings. For exercises, units are responsible for referring to appropriate EXPLANS and contacting appropri-ate exercise POCs prior to deployment to determine expected mission taskings. These EXPLANS includeCOMACC EXPLANS 80 for Red, Green, Maple, and Coalition Flags, EXPLANS 323 for Air Warrior 1,and EXPLANS 163 for Air Warrior 2. This assures the units are prepared for the appropriate tasking andallows the responding OG/CC to tailor this training for the theater, threat, and tactics for the assigned task.The SQ/CC is then responsible for implementation of this spin-up, prosecuting the required missions, anddetermining the specific requirements necessary to reach the desired level of proficiency. Emphasis willbe placed on training needed for missions not accomplished in daily operations. This training will be con-ducted IAW all applicable instructions. 6.8.1.  If a pilot is not assigned to the tasked squadron, they must receive spin-up training as deter-mined by the tasked SQ/CC. This applies to all attached pilots (OG/WG/HQ staffs, etc.), and all pilotsaugmenting from other squadrons (operational, FTU, weapons school, test, etc.). The objective of thistraining is to ensure attached/augmenting pilot is proficient to conduct all missions in support ofexpected tasking. The deploying SQ/CC will determine the amount of spin-up training required foreach attached/augmenting pilot based on the pilot's level of proficiency, currency, qualification, expe-rience, etc. For augmenting pilots, once the amount of spin-up training is determined, the augmentee'sSQ/CC is responsible for ensuring the spin-up training is accomplished. 6.8.2.  Ground Training. All applicable pilots will complete ground training as necessary prior totheir support of contingency operations or exercises. 6.8.2.1.  Academics. Units will brief exercise SPINS, ROE/Training Rules, command and con-trol, engagement authority and procedures, and visual identification. MAJCOM/IN will assist theunit's intelligence functions in the development of threat assessments and visual recognition train-ing materials. 6.8.2.2.  Visual Recognition. Pilots must be able to visually identify aircraft (rotary andfixed-wing, including joint/allied assets) they are likely to encounter by name or numerical desig-nator and determine whether the aircraft is a threat or non-threat (training should incorporate allaspects/angles, theater-specific paint schemes/fin flashes, and various configurations), identifyground equipment, and determine major categories of naval vessels. 6.8.3.  Flying Training. Tailor spin-up training to ensure all supporting pilots are proficient, current,and qualified in all expected mission taskings. 6.9.  Forms adopted or prescribed.
