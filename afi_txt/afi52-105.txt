SUMMARY OF CHANGES This  publication  has  been  substantially  revised  and  must  be  completely  reviewed.    Major changes include combining AFI 52-105V1, Chaplain Corps Resourcing, AFI 52-105V2, Chapel Tithes and Offerings Fund (CTOF), AFI 52-105V3, Chaplain Service Resourcing: Chapel Tithes and Offerings Fund Purchase Card, and AFI 52-105V4, Chaplain Service Contracts.  Multiple processes were updated to comply with the General Accounting Office (GAO) requirements for separation  of  duties.    The  Global  Ministry  Planning  Process  was  replaced  with  the  Ministry Planning Process, establishing requirements for the delivery of the Annual Ministry Plan (AMP).  The  CTOF  check  printing  process  was  centralized  at  the  Chaplain  Corps  Account  Center (CCAC).    Additionally,  the  term  Chapel  Financial  Working  Group  (CFWG)  was  updated  to Chaplain  Corps  Financial  Working  Group  (CCFWG),  and  Program  Leaders  were  moved  from voting  members  to  advisors.    The  CTOF  contracting  process  was  clarified  establishing  the requirement  for  all  CTOF  contracts  to  be  awarded  by  a  Chaplain  Corps  member  serving  as  a CTOF Contracting Officer for each contract, and training requirements were established that are required prior to  the appointment as a CTOF Contracting Officer.  Additional  clarification was also added to assist ensuring all contracts are non-personal service contracts, and the maximum length  of  CTOF  contracts  was  limited  to  three  years.    Also,  requirements  for  APF  and  CTOF contract exemptions from Executive Order 11246,  Equal Employment Opportunity were added.  Finally, the direct and indirect mission requirements tables were combined and updated to clarify the appropriate funding sources for Chaplain Corps requirements.

Overview.  The  Air  Force  Chaplain  Corps  provides  spiritual  care,  advises  leadership,  and ensures all Airmen and their dependents have opportunities to exercise their constitutional right to the free exercise of religion. 1.1.1.  Chaplain  Corps  personnel  coordinate  comprehensive,  detailed,  and  objective  Annual Ministry  Plans  (AMPs),  an  Appropriated  Fund  (APF)  budget,  and  a  Chapel  Tithes  and Offerings Fund (CTOF) budgets, and financial plans based on validated needs in support of the Chaplain Corps Strategic Plan and the commander’s intent. 1.1.2.  Strategic  Chaplain  Corps  Program  Planning.    The  AF/HC  establishes  strategic funding  requirements  based  on  the  Chaplain  Corps  Strategic  Plan.   Programming requirements  are  based  upon  operational  (MAJCOM-FOA-DRU/HC)  inputs,  and  are designed  to  meet  the  commanders’  operational  requirements  and  Chaplain  Corps  strategic functional  capability  requirements  for  organizing,  training,  and  equipping  personnel  for steady state operations and the full range of military operations. 1.1.3.  Operational  Chaplain  Corps  Program  Planning.    Provides  operational  guidance and  support  for  tactical  resourcing  of  the  Chaplain  Corps  Strategic  Plan,  emphasizing  the distinctive  mission  requirements  for  installations  within  its  specific  MAJCOM,  FOA,  or DRU. 1.1.4.  Tactical  Chaplain  Corps  Program  Planning.    The  tactical-level  Senior  Religious Support  Team  (RST)  develops  an  AMP  that  establishes  readiness  capability  and  program objective requirements based on the ministry planning process. 1.2.  Chaplain  Corps  Strategic  Priorities.  The  strategic  priorities  focus  efforts  in  order  to accomplish the Chaplain Corps mission.  The five priorities are:  Sharpen our focus on Warrior Care, strengthen our advisement  to  leadership, resource the Chaplain Corps with  requirements-based  advocacy,  maximize  our  strategic  communication,  and  enhance  our  care  for  Chaplain Corps caregivers. 1.2.1.  Sharpen  our  Focus  on Warrior  Care.  RSTs provide Airmen and their dependents with the necessary skills to ensure spiritual fitness and resiliency.  The key elements are: unit engagement, counseling, community care, and religious rites and practices. 1.2.2.  Strengthen  our  Advisement  to  Leadership.  Chaplain Corps  members  serve  as  the principle advisors to Air Force leaders at all levels regarding the free exercise of religion, the welfare of Airmen and their dependents, and the impact of religion on military operations. 1.2.2.1.  Advise  leaders  at  the  tactical,  operational,  and  strategic  levels  in  managing religious affairs within the leaders’ scope of responsibility. 1.2.2.2.  Advise  leaders  on  the  morale  and  spiritual  welfare  of  Airmen  and  their dependents within the leaders’ scope of responsibility. 1.2.2.3.  Advise commanders on resource requirements to provide Warrior Care and care for Chaplains Corps caregivers. AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015   7  1.2.3.  Resource  the  Chaplain  Corps  with  Requirements-Based  Advocacy.  Identifying requirements  to  execute  mission  essential  tasks  and  successfully  advocating  those requirements  through  the  corporate  process  are  two  keys  to  resourcing  the  Chaplain  Corps.  The key elements include manpower, funds, facilities, materials, education, and training. 1.2.4.  Maximize  our  Strategic  Communication.  The  employment  of strategic communications  models  are  intentionally  targeting  echelons  with  information  to  and  from tactical,  operational,  and  strategic  partners.    The  goal  of  the  Chaplain  Corps  is  to  leverage technology to improve strategic communication at all levels. 1.2.5.  Enhance  our  Care  for  Chaplain  Corps  Caregivers.    Chaplains  and  Chaplain Assistants  caring  for  one  another  to  promote  a  healthy  and  resilient  Air  Force  Chaplain Corps.    Providing  opportunities  for  post-traumatic  growth  and  renewal  can  help  maintain  a healthy Corps of Caregivers ready to do the mission at home station or deployed.  The key elements include reintegration, retreats, self-care, team-care and family events. 1.3.  Ministry  Planning  Process.  The  ministry  planning  process  is  fundamental  to  successful Chaplain  Corps  resource  management  and  mission  accomplishment.    It  identifies,  itemizes, contextualizes, and prioritizes the tactical-level deliverables and ministry requirements necessary to  provide  the  best  possible  warrior  care  to  all  Airmen  and  their  dependents.    The  ministry planning process culminates in the AMP. 1.3.1.  The Annual Ministry Plan.  The AMP is a product of the ministry planning process.  The AMP is a published document which identifies, validates, and prioritizes the upcoming fiscal  year  (FY)  ministry  deliverables  and  resource  requirements  at  the  tactical-level.    The Senior  RST  develops  the  AMP  in  partnership  with  the  assigned  Chaplain  Corps  team members,  and  in  concert  with  the  Chaplain  Corps  Strategic  Priorities,  AF  Common  Output Levels  of  Standards  (COLS)  sub-functions,  the  supported  Commander’s  intent,  and  other relative  requirements.    The  AMP  must  be  realistic  and  measurable.    MAJCOM-DRU-FOA/HC  Senior  RSTs  validate  the  AMP  and  the  supported  Commander  (typically  the Installation Commander) approves it prior to implementation. 1.3.2.  The Six Steps of the Ministry Planning Process. 1.3.2.1.  Step  1  –  Identify  Ministry  Context.  The  Senior  RST  will  identify  and understand all policies and guidance that inform the context of the AMP.  These include, as a minimum, the requirements found in or derived from: 1.3.2.1.1.  U. S. Constitution and public law. 1.3.2.1.2.  Department of Defense publications. 1.3.2.1.3.  U. S. Air Force publications. 1.3.2.1.4.  MAJCOM/DRU/FOA publications. 1.3.2.1.5.  AF COLS. 1.3.2.1.6.  Air Force Chaplain Corps Strategic Plan. 1.3.2.1.7.  Tactical-level  policies and guidance that inform the installation’s ministry context. 1.3.2.1.7.1.  Mission, vision, and goals.   8  AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015 1.3.2.1.7.2.  Supported Commander’s intent. 1.3.2.1.7.3.  Memorandums  of  Agreement/Memorandums  of  Understanding  (as applicable) and Status of Forces Agreement(s). 1.3.2.1.7.4.  Supported demographics. 1.3.2.2.  Step  2  –  Identify  Ministry  Capacity.  The  Senior  RST  will  identify  the variables that affect the Chaplain Corps’ capacity and capability to deliver spiritual care to Airmen and their dependents including, as a minimum: 1.3.2.2.1.  Manpower.  Capacity  and  requirements  calculations  for  steady-state locations are based on a standard 40 hour work week.  Projected manpower capacity must account for: 1.3.2.2.1.1.  Expected  fluctuations  in  manpower  due  to  illness,  leave,  TDYs, deployments, and reduced RST availability. 1.3.2.2.1.2.  Military  and  Air  Force  Auxiliary  personnel  (Active  Duty,  Reserve, Air National Guard, and Civil Air Patrol). 1.3.2.2.1.3.  Civilians  (Government  Schedule  (GS),  Non-Appropriated  Funds (NAF), and host nation) and contractors. 1.3.2.2.2.  Community  Resources.    Community  resources  such  as  volunteers,  local civilian clergy, off-installation worshipping communities, religiously oriented private organizations, and other faith-based establishments. 1.3.2.2.3.  Funding. CTOF, APF, and NAF. 1.3.2.2.4.  Assets.  Available  facilities,  equipment,  government  vehicles,  specialized places  (e.g.,  annex  with  kitchen),  and  supplies.    Reliance  on,  and  use  of,  privately owned conveyances and privately owned vehicles to accomplish official government business is generally prohibited and will be limited to those situations authorized by the  Joint  Ethics  Regulations,  the  Joint  Travel  Regulations  and  other  applicable  Air Force instructions. 1.3.2.2.5.  Military/Organizational  Requirements.  Time and resources required to satisfy inherently military duties and requirements can decrease the Chaplain Corps’ capacity to deliver spiritual care.  These requirements include, but are not limited to, facility  maintenance,  office  management,  additional  duty  requirements,  supervisory responsibilities,  general  military  training  (chemical  warfare,  information  assurance, etc.), and physical fitness. 1.3.2.3.  Step  3  –  Identify  Requirements.  The Senior RST will leverage the data from the following resources to ensure compliance with established requirements: 1.3.2.3.1.  AF COLS. 1.3.2.3.2.  Supported Commander’s intent. 1.3.2.3.3.  Needs assessments. 1.3.2.3.4.  Prior FY AMP. AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015   9  1.3.2.3.5.  Prior  FY  Air  Force  Chaplain  Corps  Activity  Reporting  System (AFCCARS) data. 1.3.2.4.  Step 4 – Develop the Annual Ministry Plan.  The AMP includes the following components: 1.3.2.4.1.  Introduction:    Written  with  the  supported  Commander  as  the  primary audience; its  purpose,  definition  of requirements-based activities vs. discretional activities, and when the AMP should be adjusted. includes  an  explanation  of the  AMP, 1.3.2.4.2.  Vision, mission, and priorities for the following: 1.3.2.4.2.1.  Air Force Chaplain Corps. 1.3.2.4.2.2.  Installation. 1.3.2.4.2.3.  Local Chaplain Corps. 1.3.2.4.3.  Annual  and  monthly  resources,  event  and  activity  projections,  including manpower and funding and event calendars. 1.3.2.4.4.  CTOF  projections:    Annual  and  monthly  overviews  by  date  and  by  faith group. 1.3.2.5.  Step 5 – Functional Validation. 1.3.2.5.1.  The tactical-level Senior RST will submit a proposed AMP to MAJCOM-DRU-FOA/HC for functional validation NLT 1 February. 1.3.2.5.2.  The MAJCOM-DRU-FOA Senior RST will: 1.3.2.5.2.1.  Perform  a  functional  validation  on  all  submitted  AMPs,  and  return the  AMPs,  with  AMP  Functional  Validation  Memorandum  (FVM),  to  the originating  Senior  RST  (for  adjustment,  resubmission,  or  presentation  to  the supported  Commander),  within  30  days  from  receipt.  The  functional  validation ensures compatibility with: 1.3.2.5.2.1.1.  U. S. Constitution and public law. 1.3.2.5.2.1.2.  Department of Defense publications. 1.3.2.5.2.1.3.  U. S. Air Force publications. 1.3.2.5.2.1.4.  MAJCOM-DRU-FOA publications. 1.3.2.5.2.1.5.  AF COLS. 1.3.2.5.2.1.6.  Air Force Chaplain Corps Strategic Plan. 1.3.2.5.2.1.7.  Development of the AMP (Paragraph 1.3.2.4). 1.3.2.5.2.2.  Provide the originating Senior RST with an FVM. The FVM will: 1.3.2.5.2.2.1.  State concurrence for presentation of the AMP to the supported Commander,  or  if  required,  itemize  recommendations  for  AMP  adjustment and resubmission for functional validation. 1.3.2.5.2.2.2.  Be  generated  on  appropriate  echelon  letterhead  and  signed  by   10  AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015 the MAJCOM-DRU-FOA/HC Senior RST. 1.3.2.6.  Step 6 – Implementation, Monitoring, and Revision. 1.3.2.6.1.  The  tactical-level  Senior  RST  must  submit  a  validated  AMP  to  the supported Commander for approval NLT 1 March. 1.3.2.6.2.  Upon supported Commander approval of the AMP, the Senior RST will: 1.3.2.6.2.1.  Ensure  the  AMP  is  available  and  briefed  to  all  supported  senior leaders. 1.3.2.6.2.2.  Ensure  the  AMP  is  available  and  briefed  to  all  assigned  Chaplain Corps personnel. 1.3.2.6.2.3.  Intentionally implement the AMP 1.3.2.6.2.4.  Conduct and document quarterly evaluations of the AMP to ensure its effectiveness, adjusting and revalidating the AMP as needed: 1.3.2.6.2.4.1.  At the direction of the supported Commander. 1.3.2.6.2.4.2.  When  mission  requirements  or  resources  change  by  more  than 20%, or when adjustment is deemed necessary in order to successfully execute the AMP according to requirements. 1.3.3.  AFCCARS  Ministry  Planning  Tool.  The  tactical-level  Senior  RST  is  encouraged, but  not  required,  to  utilize  the  AFCCARS  Ministry  Planning  Tool  (MPT)  to  assist  in  the ministry planning process and the development of the AMP.  The MPT is contained within the  AFCCARS  Base  Consolidation  Tool  and  it  simplifies,  standardizes,  and  expedites  the ministry  planning  process.    When  used  correctly,  the  MPT  will  automatically  generate  an Annual Ministry Plan IAW the requirements of Paragraph 1.3.2.4 AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015   11  Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

General  Information.  CTOF non-personal service contracts are used to support Chaplain Corps programs.  Fund contracts from either APF or CTOF in accordance with Attachment 2. 6.2.  Funding  Guidance.  Use  CTOF  non-personal  service  contracts  for  indirect  mission requirements.    Fund  direct  mission  requirements  via  APF.    Use  CTOF  non-personal  service contracts to satisfy indirect mission requirements and, as such, do not affect Air Force manpower and are exempt from Air Force Manpower review. 6.3.  Contract Types. 6.3.1.  Personal Service Contracts.  Do not use CTOF to award personal service contracts.  A personal services contract is characterized by an actual (or apparent) employer-employee relationship created between the government and the contractor.  Each contract arrangement must  be  judged  in  the  light  of  its  own  facts  and  circumstances.    Consider  the  IRS  Twenty Common  Law  Factors  in  Attachment  14  to  determine  whether  an  employer-employee relationship will result from the contract. (T-0). 6.3.2.  Non-personal  Service  Contracts.  A  non-personal  service  contract  is  where  the personnel  rendering  the  services  are  not  subject,  either  by  the  contract's  terms  or  by  the manner  of  its  administration,  to  the  supervision  and  control  usually  prevailing  in relationships between the government and its employees.

Contractors  are  not  included  in  staff meetings, advisory council meetings, or training sessions unless specified in their statement of work (SOW).  If specified, reimbursement for attendance is authorized.  This limitation is to  preclude  an  employer-employee  relationship  (i.e.  by  referring  to,  or  including  them  as “staff members,” the appearance of an employer-employee relationship exists). 6.4.3.  The contractor is responsible for the complete end product or service. 6.4.4.  The contractor is not paid an hourly rate, unless specified in the SOW.  The contractor is paid to perform a regular service.  Therefore, neither man-hours nor compensatory time-off is authorized. 6.4.5.  The  CTOF  Contracting  Officer  monitors  and  inspects  the  contractor's  work.    The CTOF  Contracting  Officer  provides  written  notification  to  the  contractor  of  all  compliance deviations from the requirements of the SOW. 6.4.6.  The contractor may be reasonably required to coordinate activities with the individual responsible for programs. 6.5.  Preliminary CTOF Contract Procedures. 6.5.1.

This means the successful awarded bidder is an independent contractor responsible for the accounting and payment of Social Security Taxes, Federal Income Taxes, State Income Taxes, Unemployment Insurance premiums and tort liability.  Bid Procedure. We will use the following two-step sealed bid procedure to determine award of contract:  Step One. Applicants are to submit technical proposals.

The renewal option allows bidders to include cost of living increases.  Basis for Award.

We are accepting applications for a Chapel Tithes and Offerings (CTOF) non-personal service contract.  This means the successful awarded bidder is an independent contractor responsible for the accounting and payment of Social Security Taxes, Federal Income Taxes, State Income Taxes, Unemployment Insurance premiums and tort liability.  Sealed Bid Procedure. We will use the following three-step sealed bid procedure to determine award of contract based on best value to the government:  Step One. Applicants are asked to submit technical proposals and sealed bids. Interviews and/or demonstration of special skills may also be required. Bidders may be required to submit their bids in a format that includes a dollar amount per unit for the basic one year contract and each of the two one year renewal periods (if any). The renewal option allows bidders to include cost of living increases.  Step Two. The CTOF Contracting Officer and at least two other individuals form a panel to review and evaluate applicants’ technical proposals and special skills demonstration using a numbered grading system. Once the grading process is complete, the points are totaled for each applicant. The applications are placed in order from highest accumulated points to lowest.  Step Three. The panel will then open the bid for the individual with the most accumulated points to ensure the bid does not exceed the maximum funding limit.  Basis for Award.  If the individual with the most accumulated points exceeds the maximum funding limit, the panel moves to the next individual in line and open his/her bid. This process is repeated until a bid is opened that does not exceed the maximum funding limit.  If there is a tie between two or more applicants with the most accumulated points, the bids for these individuals are opened with the panel selecting the lowest bidder.  In the event of two equally low bids, award is made through drawing by lot, limited to the tied bidders.  Time permitting; the bidders involved are given an opportunity to attend the drawing.  The drawing is witnessed by at least two persons.  The contract file will contain the names of the witnesses.  The results of the drawing are also documented and maintained in the contract file.

Instructions.  A  worker  who  is  required  to  comply  with  other  persons’  instructions about when, where, and how he or she is to work is ordinarily an employee.  This control factor is present if the person or persons for whom the services are performed have the right to require compliance with instructions. A14.2.  Training.  Training the worker by requiring an experienced employee to work with the worker,  by  corresponding  with  the  worker,  by  requiring  the  worker  to  attend  meetings,  or  by using other methods, indicates that the person or  persons for whom the services  are performed want the services performed in a particular method or manner. A14.3.  Integration.  Integration  of  the  worker’s  services  into  the  overall  business  operations generally  shows  that  the  worker  is  subject  to  direction  and  control.    When  the  success  or continuation  of  a  business  depends  to  an  appreciable  degree  upon  the  performance  of  certain services, the workers who perform those services must necessarily be subject to a certain amount of control by the owner of the business. A14.4.  Services Rendered Personally.  If the services must be rendered personally, presumably the person or persons for whom the services are performed are interested in the methods used to accomplish the work as well as in the results, and the control factor is satisfied. A14.5.  Continuing  Relationship.  A  continuing  and  regular  relationship  between  the  worker and  the  person  or  persons  for  whom  the  services  are  performed  indicates  that  an employer/employee relationship exists. A continuing and regular basis may exist where work is performed at frequently recurring, although irregular intervals. A14.6.  Set Hours  Of Work.  The establishment of set hours of work by the person or persons for whom the services are performed is a factor indicating and showing necessary control. A14.7.  Doing Work On Employer’s Premises.  If the work is performed on the premises of the person or persons for whom the services are being performed, that factor suggests control over the worker, especially if the work could be done elsewhere.  Work done off the premise of the person  or  persons  receiving  the  services,  such  as  at  the  office  of  the  worker,  indicates  some freedom  from  control.    However,  this  fact  by  itself  does  not  mean  that  the  worker  is  not  an employee.  The importance of this factor depends on the nature of the service involved and the extent  to  which  an  employer  generally  would  require  that  employees  perform  such  services  on the employer’s premises.  Control over the place of work is indicated when the person or persons for whom the services are performed have the right to compel the worker to travel a designated route, to canvas a territory within a certain time, or to work at specific places as required. A14.8.  Order Or Sequence Set.  If a worker must perform services in the order or sequence set by the person or persons for whom the services are performed, that factor shows that the worker is not free to follow the worker’s own pattern of work but must follow the established routines and schedules of the person or persons for whom the services are performed.  Often, because of the nature of an occupation, the person or persons for whom the services are performed do not set  the  order  of  the  services  or  set  the  order  infrequently.  It  is  sufficient  to  show  control, however, if such person or persons retain the right to do so. AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015   89  A14.9.  Oral  Or  Written  Reports.  A  requirement  that  the  worker  submit  regular  or  written reports  to  the  person  or  persons  for  whom  the  services  are  performed  indicates  a  degree  of control appropriate for an employee. A14.10.  Payment  Of  Business  And/Or  Traveling  Expenses.  If  the  person  or  persons  for whom the services are performed ordinarily pay the worker’s business and/or traveling expenses, the  worker  is  ordinarily  an  employee.    An  employer,  to  be  able  to  control  expenses,  generally retains the right to regulate and direct the worker’s business activities A14.11.  Furnishing  Of  Tools  And  Materials.  The  fact  that  the  person  or  persons  for  whom the services are performed furnish significant tools, materials, and other equipment tends to show the existence of an employer/employee relationship. A14.12.  Right  To  Discharge.  The  right  to  discharge  a  worker  is  a  factor  indicating  that  the worker  is  an  employee  and  the  person  possessing  the  right  is  an  employer.  An  employer exercises control through the threat of dismissal, which causes the worker to obey the employer’s instructions.  An  independent  contractor,  on  the  other  hand,  cannot  be  fired  so  long  as  the independent contractor produces a result that meets the contract specifications. A14.13.  Right To Terminate.  If the worker has the right to end his or her relationship with the person  for  whom  the  services  are  performed  at  any  time  he  or  she  wishes  without  incurring liability, that factor indicates an employer/employee relationship. A14.14.  Significant Investment.  If the worker invests in facilities that are used by the worker in performing services and are not typically maintained by employees (such as the maintenance of an office rented at fair value from a related party), that factor tends to indicate that the worker is  an  independent  contractor.  On  the  other  hand,  lack  of  investment  in  facilities  indicates dependence on the person or persons for which the services are performed for such facilities and accordingly,  the  existence  of  an  employer/employee  relationship.  Special  scrutiny  is  required with respect to certain types of facilities such as home offices. A14.15.  Realization Of Profit Or Loss.  A worker who can realize a profit or suffer a loss as a result of the worker’s services (in addition to the profit or loss ordinarily realized by employees) is generally an independent contractor, but the worker who cannot is an employee.  For example, if the worker is subject to a real risk of economic loss due to significant investments or a bona fide liability for expenses, such as salary payments to unrelated employees, that factor indicates that the worker is an independent contractor. The risk that the worker will not receive payment for his or her services, however, is common to both independent contractors and employees and thus  does  not  constitute  a  sufficient  economic  risk  to  support  treatment  as  an  independent contractor. A14.16.  Working  For  More  Than  One  Firm  At  A  Time.  If  a  worker  performs  more  than minimal  services  for  a  multiple  of  unrelated  persons  or  firms  at  the  same  time,  that  factor generally  indicates  that  the  worker  is  an  independent  contractor.    However,  a  worker  who performs  services  for  more  than  one  person  may  be  an  employee  of  each  of  the  persons, especially where such persons are part of the same service arrangement. A14.17.  Making Services  Available To General  Public.  The fact that a worker makes his or her  services  available  to  the  general  public  on  a  regular  and  consistent  basis  indicates  an independent contractor relationship.   90  AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015 A14.18.  Hiring  Supervising,  And  Paying  Assistants.  If  the  person  or  persons  for  whom  the services  are  performed  hire,  supervise,  and  pay  assistants,  that  factor  generally  shows  control over  the  workers  on  the  job.    However,  if  one  worker  hires,  supervises,  and  pays  the  other assistants pursuant to a contract under which the worker is responsible only for the attainment of a result, this factor indicates an independent contractor status. A14.19.  Full Time Required.  If the worker must devote substantially full time to the business of  the  person  or  persons  for  whom  the  services  are  performed,  such  person  or  persons  have control over the amount of time the worker spends working and thereby restricts the worker from doing  other  gainful  work.  An  independent  contractor,  on  the  other  hand,  is  free  to  work  when and for whom he or she chooses. A14.20.  Payment  By  Hour,  Week,  Month.  Payment  by  the  hour,  week,  or  month  generally points to an employer/employee relationship, provided that this method or payment is not just a convenient way of paying a lump sum agreed upon as the cost of a job.  Payment made by the job or on a straight commission generally indicates that the worker is an independent contractor.  AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015   91  Attachment 15 CTOF GENERAL PROVISIONS MEMORANDUM l.

In any dispute arising out of this contract, the decision of which requires consideration of law questions, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be interpreted and determined in accordance with the substantive laws of the United States of America.   92  AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015 4. Legal Status. The NAFI is an integral part of the Department of Defense and is an instrumentality of the United States Government. Therefore, NAFI contracts are United States Government contracts; however, they do not obligate appropriated funds of the United States.  5. Examination of Records. This clause is applicable under contracts that are entered into by means of negotiation and where price and costing data are required to support a determination of price reasonableness. This clause does not apply to commercial items or when the Contracting Officer determines that prices agreed upon are based on adequate price competition. The Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative shall have the right to examine and audit the books and records of the Contractor directly pertaining to the contract during the period of the contract and until the expiration of three years after the final payment. 6. Assignment The Contractor or its assignee’s rights to be paid amounts due as a result of performance of this contract, may be assigned. No assignment by the Contractor, assigning its rights or delegating its obligations under this contract will be effective and binding on the NAFI until the written terms of the assignment have been approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. 7. Gratuities.  a. The NAFI may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right of the Contractor to proceed under this contract if it is found, after notice and hearing, by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative, that gratuities (in the form of entertainment, gifts, or otherwise) were offered or given by the Contractor, or any agent, or representative of the Contractor, to any officer or employees of the Government or the NAFI with a view toward securing favorable treatment with respect to the awarding or amending, or the making of any determinations with respect to the performing of such contract. b. In the event this contract is terminated as provided in paragraph "a" hereof, the NAFI shall be entitled (i) to pursue the same remedies against the Contractor as it could pursue in the event of a breach of contract by the Contractor, and (ii) as a penalty in addition to any other damages to which it may be entitled by law, to exemplary damages in an amount (as determined by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative) which shall be not less than three nor more than ten times the cost incurred by the Contractor in providing any such gratuities to any such officer or employee. c. The rights and remedies of the NAFI provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract. 8. Termination for Convenience. The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the NAFI. If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract's date. To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2. AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015   93  9. Cancellation By Mutual Agreement. Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract. 10. Termination for Cause.   a. (1) The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to- (i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any Extension; (ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below);or (iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below). (2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure. b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continuethe work not terminated. c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. d. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any (1) completed supplies, and (2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest. e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.   94  AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015 f. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI. g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract. 11. Inspection and Acceptance. Inspection and acceptance will be at destination, unless otherwise provided in this contract. Notwithstanding the requirements for any NAFI inspection and test contained in specifications applicable to this contract, except where specialized inspections or tests are specified for performance solely by the NAFI, the Contractor, shall perform or have performed the inspections and tests required to substantiate that the supplies provided under the contract conform to the drawings, specifications, and contract requirements listed herein, including if applicable the technical requirements for the manufacturers' part numbers specified herein. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. Acceptance of the supplies or services or a written notice of rejections must be accomplished on or before the third working day following delivery of the supplies or services, unless otherwise specified in this contract. 12. Variation in Quantities. No variation in quantity of any item called for by this contract will be accepted unless authorized by the Contracting Officer. 13. Partial Deliveries. Partial deliveries are not permitted unless authorized by the terms of the contract or approved by the Contracting Officer. 14. Payments.  Partial payments will be made when deliveries are authorized or as approved by the Contracting Officer. Payments and penalties for late payments are subject to the requirements established by the Prompt Payment Act, as amended, and as implemented for NAFI's. If the NAFI makes payment but such payment fails to include a prompt payment penalty due to the Contractor within 10 days from when the contract payment is made, penalty amounts will not be paid unless the Contractor makes a written request within forty days after the date of payment. 15. Hold and Save Harmless. The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any part thereof. Contractor further agrees to hold the NAFI harmless from all claims or judgments for damages resulting from the use of products or services listed in this contract, except for such claims or damages caused by, or resulting from negligence of NAFI customers, employees, agents, or representatives. Also, Contractor shall at all times hold and save harmless the NAFI, its agents, representatives, and employees from any and all suits, claims, charges, and expenses which arise out of acts or omissions of Contractor, its agents, representatives, or employees. 16. Modifications. No agreement or understanding to modify this contract will be binding upon the NAFI unless made in writing and signed by a Contracting Officer from the office that issued the contract or its successor. AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015   95  17. Taxes. a. Except as may be otherwise provided in this contract, the contract price includes all taxes, duties or other public charges in effect and applicable to this contract on the contract date, except any tax, duty, or other public charge, which by law, regulation or governmental agreement, is not applicable to expenditures made by the NAFI or on its behalf; or any tax, duty, or other public charge from which the Contractor, or any subcontractor hereunder, is exempt by law, regulation or otherwise. If any such tax, duty, or other public charge has been included in the contract price, through error or otherwise, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced. b. If for any reason, after the contract date of execution, the Contractor or subcontractor is relieved in whole or in part from the payment or the burden of any tax, duty, or other public charge included in the contract price, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced; or if the Contractor or subcontractor is required to pay in whole or in part any tax, duty, of other public charge which was not applicable at the contract date of execution the contract price shall be correspondingly increased. 18. Proof of Shipment. (Applicable to shipments outside the United States through the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) and Parcel Post shipments to overseas destinations.) a. Notwithstanding any clause of this contract to the contrary, payment will be made for items not yet received, upon receipt of an invoice accompanied by an appropriate proof of shipment. If shipment is made by insured parcel post, the contractor must furnish a copy of the Insured Mail Receipt issued by the US Postal Service. Otherwise, a stamped copy of a Certificate of Mailing issued by the US Postal Service must be furnished. If shipment is made by a common carrier (rail, air or motor freight), the Contractor must furnish a signed copy of the shipping document on which items are receipted for by the common carrier. A signed receipt by a NAFI representative at the delivery point (CCP or POE) is also acceptable evidence of proof of shipment. b. Forwarding a proof of shipment and an invoice for payment by the Contractor shall be construed as a certification by the contractor that the items shipped conform to the specifications. c. Notwithstanding any provisions of this clause or any payment made pursuant to the terms of this clause prior to receipt of the items contracted for, the NAFI retains the right to inspect upon receipt and the right to reject nonconforming items. The liability of the Contractor with respect to items for which payments have been made will, after inspection by the NAFI or after the expiration of a reasonable time following delivery to the NAFI within which inspection may be made, whichever occurs first, be limited to (i) exceptions taken at the time of inspection, and (ii) latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as amount to fraud. 19. Commercial Warranty. The Contractor agrees that the supplies or services furnished under this contract shall be covered by the most favorable commercial warranties the Contractor gives to any customer for such supplies or services and that the rights and remedies provided herein are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the NAFI by any other clause of this contract. The printed terms and conditions of such warranty will be provided to the NAFI with the delivery of any supplies covered. 20. Advertisements. Contractor agrees that none of its nor its agent's advertisements, to include publications, merchandise, promotions, coupons, sweepstakes, contest, sales brochures, etc, shall   96  AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015 state, infer or imply that the Contractor's products or services are approved, promoted, or endorsed by the NAFI. Any advertisement, including cents-off coupons, which refers to a NAFI will contain a statement that the advertisement is neither paid for, nor sponsored in whole or in part by, the particular activity. 21. Discounts for Prompt Payment. a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers. However, any offered discount will form a part of the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount period indicated in the offer by the offeror. As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices. b. In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day. 22. Invoices.  a. An invoice is a written request for payment under the contract for supplies delivered or for services rendered. In order to be proper, an invoice should include (and in order to support the payment of interest penalties, must include) the following: (i) Invoice date; (ii) Name of Contractor; (iii) Contract number (including order number, if any), contract line item number, contract description of supplies or services, quantity, contract unit of measure and unit price, and extended total; (iv) Shipment number and date of shipment (Bill of Lading number and weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government Bills of Lading); (v) Name and address to which payment is to be sent (which must be the same as that in the contract or on a proper notice of assignment); (vi) Name (where practicable), title, phone number and mailing address of person to be notified in event of a defective invoice; and (vii) Any other information or documentation required by other provisions of the contract (such as evidence of shipment). Invoices shall be prepared and submitted in duplicate (one copy shall be marked “Original") unless otherwise specified. b. For purposes of determining if interest begins to accrue under the PROMPT PAYMENT ACT (PUBLIC LAW 97-177): AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015   97  (i) A proper invoice will be deemed to have been received when it is received by the office designated in the contract for receipt of invoices and acceptance of the supplies delivered or services rendered has occurred. (ii) Payment shall be considered made on the date on which a check for such payment is dated. (iii) Payment terms (e.g., "Net 20") offered by the contractor will not be deemed Required payment dates. (iv) The following periods of time will not be included: (A) After receipt of improper invoice and prior to notice of any defect or impropriety, but not to exceed three days for meat and meat food products, five days for perishable agricultural commodities, and 15 days in all other cases, and (B) Between the date of a notice of any defect or impropriety and the date a proper invoice is received. When the notice is in writing, it shall be considered made on the date shown on the notice. 23. Electronic Fund Transfer Payments. Federal law 31 USC requires Federal payments to be made by electronic fund transfer. Any payment made on this contract will be made using the Government Purchase Card as the method of EFT (unless otherwise specified within the contract or exempted by law). 24. Notification of Debarment/Suspension Status. The Contractor shall provide immediate notice to the Contracting Officer in the event of being suspended, debarred or declared ineligible by any other Federal Department or agency, or upon 25. List of FAR Clauses Incorporated The provisions of the following clauses set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or DoD FAR Supplement are hereby incorporated into this order or contract by reference with the same force and effect as though herein set forth in full. As used in the following clauses, the term "Government" is deleted and the abbreviation "NAFI" is substituted in lieu thereof.

(2) Method of shipment or packing.  (3) Place of delivery.  (b) If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under this contract, whether or not changed by the order, the   98  AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015 Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the contract price, the delivery schedule, or both, and shall modify the contract.  (c) The Contractor must assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within 30 days from the date of receipt of the written order. However, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted before final payment of the contract.  (d) If the Contractor’s proposal includes the cost of property made obsolete or excess by the change, the Contracting Officer shall have the right to prescribe the manner of the disposition of the property.  (e) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause. However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the Contractor from proceeding with the contract as changed.  (b) If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the estimated cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under this contract, whether or not changed by the order, or otherwise affects any other terms and conditions of this contract, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the—  (1) Estimated cost, delivery or completion schedule, or both;  (2) Amount of any fixed fee; and  (3) Other affected terms and shall modify the contract accordingly.

(e) Notwithstanding the terms and conditions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this clause, the estimated cost of this contract and, if this contract is incrementally funded, the funds allotted for the performance of this contract, shall not be increased or considered to be increased except by specific written modification of the contract indicating the new contract estimated cost and, if this contract is incrementally funded, the new amount allotted to the contract. Until this modification is made, the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance or incur costs beyond the point established in the Limitation of Cost or Limitation of Funds clause of this contract.  25.1.1. Alternate I (Apr 1984). If the requirement is for services, other than architect-engineer or other professional services, and no supplies are to be furnished, substitute the following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the basic clause:  (a) The Contracting Officer may at any time, by written order, and without notice to the sureties, if any, make changes within the general scope of this contract in any one or more of the following:  (1) Description of services to be performed.

(2) Time of performance (i.e., hours of the day, days of the week, etc.).  (3) Place of performance of the services.  (4) Drawings, designs, or specifications when the supplies to be furnished are to be specially manufactured for the Government, in accordance with the drawings, designs, or specifications.  (5) Method of shipment or packing of supplies.  (6) Place of delivery.  25.2. FAR 52.222-13 - Compliance with Davis-Bacon and related Act Regulations (Feb 1988). All rulings and interpretations of the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts contained in 29 CFR parts 1, 3, and 5 are hereby incorporated by reference in this contract. 25.3. FAR 52.222-41 - Service Contract Act of 1965, as Amended (Nov 2007). (a) Definitions. As used in this clause—  “Act” means the Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.).  “Contractor,” when this clause is used in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term “Government Prime Contractor.”  “Service employee” means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as these terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised. It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor and such persons.  (b) Applicability. This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4). This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in Subpart C of 29 CFR Part 4.  (c) Compensation.  (1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor, or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract.  (2)(i) If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract   100  AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015 (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c).  (ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request For Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees’ authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary.  (iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination.  (iv)(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed.  (B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed.  AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015   101  (C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.  (v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this paragraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract.  (vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced contract work.  (3) Adjustment of compensation. If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees under this contract shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division.  (d) Obligation to furnish fringe benefits. The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4.  (e) Minimum wage. In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee.  (f) Successor contracts. If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary’s authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to   102  AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015 service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm’s length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor’s collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm’s length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision.  (g) Notification to employees. The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract.  (h) Safe and sanitary working conditions. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925.  (i) Records.  (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record of the following:  (i) For each employee subject to the Act—  (A) Name and address and social security number;  (B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation;  (C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and  (D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee.  (ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested parties or by the AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015   103  Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement.  (iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor’s employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause.  (2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division.  (3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases.  (4) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours.  (j) Pay periods. The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly.  (k) Withholding of payments and termination of contract. The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional cost.  (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act.  (m) Collective bargaining agreements applicable to service employees. If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later   104  AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015 time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof.  (n) Seniority list. Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the Contractor’s or subcontractor’s payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor Contractors of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract.  (o) Rulings and interpretations. Rulings and interpretations of the Act are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4.  (p) Contractor’s certification.  (1) By entering into this contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the Contractor’s firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed under section 5 of the Act.  (2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under section 5 of the Act.  (3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001.  (q) Variations, tolerances, and exemptions involving employment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business:  (1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525).  (2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015   105  prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525).  (3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR parts 525 and 528.  (r) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS), U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman’s rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program.  (s) Tips. An employee engaged in an occupation in which the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips may have the amount of these tips credited by the employer against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act, in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations, 29 CFR Part 531. However, the amount of credit shall not exceed $1.34 per hour beginning January 1, 1981. To use this provision—  (1) The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized;  (2) The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips received);  (3) The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct wages and tip credit; and  (4) The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of section 4(c) of the Act.  (t) Disputes concerning labor standards. The U.S. Department of Labor has set forth in 29 CFR parts 4, 6, and 8 procedures for resolving disputes concerning labor standards requirements. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes clause of this contract. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employees or their representatives.  25.5. FAR 52.222-4 - Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act-Overtime Compensation (July 2005). (a) Overtime requirements. No Contractor or subcontractor employing laborers or mechanics (see Federal Acquisition Regulation 22.300) shall require or permit them to work over 40 hours   106  AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015 in any workweek unless they are paid at least 1 and 1/2 times the basic rate of pay for each hour worked over 40 hours.  (b) Violation; liability for unpaid wages; liquidated damages. The responsible Contractor and subcontractor are liable for unpaid wages if they violate the terms in paragraph (a) of this clause. In addition, the Contractor and subcontractor are liable for liquidated damages payable to the Government. The Contracting Officer will assess liquidated damages at the rate of $10 per affected employee for each calendar day on which the employer required or permitted the employee to work in excess of the standard workweek of 40 hours without paying overtime wages required by the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act.  (c) Withholding for unpaid wages and liquidated damages. The Contracting Officer will withhold from payments due under the contract sufficient funds required to satisfy any Contractor or subcontractor liabilities for unpaid wages and liquidated damages. If amounts withheld under the contract are insufficient to satisfy Contractor or subcontractor liabilities, the Contracting Officer will withhold payments from other Federal or federally assisted contracts held by the same Contractor that are subject to the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act.  (d) Payrolls and basic records.  (1) The Contractor and its subcontractors shall maintain payrolls and basic payroll records for all laborers and mechanics working on the contract during the contract and shall make them available to the Government until 3 years after contract completion. The records shall contain the name and address of each employee, social security number, labor classifications, hourly rates of wages paid, daily and weekly number of hours worked, deductions made, and actual wages paid. The records need not duplicate those required for construction work by Department of Labor regulations at 29 CFR 5.5(a)(3) implementing the Davis-Bacon Act.  (2) The Contractor and its subcontractors shall allow authorized representatives of the Contracting Officer or the Department of Labor to inspect, copy, or transcribe records maintained under paragraph (d)(1) of this clause.

(e) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall insert the provisions set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this clause in subcontracts that may require or involve the employment of laborers and mechanics and require subcontractors to include these provisions in any such lower tier subcontracts. The Contractor shall be responsible for compliance by any subcontractor or lower-tier subcontractor with the provisions set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this clause.  25.6. FAR 52.246-16 - Responsibility for Supplies (Apr 1984). (a) Title to supplies furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon formal acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession, unless the contract specifically provides for earlier passage of title.  (b) Unless the contract specifically provides otherwise, risk of loss of or damage to supplies shall remain with the Contractor until, and shall pass to the Government upon—  (1) Delivery of the supplies to a carrier, if transportation is f.o.b. origin; or  AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015   107  (2) Acceptance by the Government or delivery of the supplies to the Government at the destination specified in the contract, whichever is later, if transportation is f.o.b. destination.  (c) Paragraph (b) of this clause shall not apply to supplies that so fail to conform to contract requirements as to give a right of rejection. The risk of loss of or damage to such nonconforming supplies remains with the Contractor until cure or acceptance. After cure or acceptance, paragraph (b) of this clause shall apply.  (d) Under paragraph (b) of this clause, the Contractor shall not be liable for loss of or damage to supplies caused by the negligence of officers, agents, or employees of the Government acting within the scope of their employment.  25.7. FAR 52.222-20 - Walsh-Healy Public Contracts Act (Dec 1996).

(b) All employees whose work relates to this contract shall be paid not less than the minimum wage prescribed by regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor (41 CFR 50-202.2). Learners, student learners, apprentices, and handicapped workers may be employed at less than the prescribed minimum wage (see 41 CFR 50-202.3) to the same extent that such employment is permitted under Section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act (41 U.S.C. 40).  25.8. FAR 52.222-26 - Equal Opportunity (Apr 2015). (a) Definition. “United States,” as used in this clause, means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Wake Island.

Upon request, the Contractor shall provide information necessary to determine the applicability of this clause.  (2) If the Contractor is a religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society, the requirements of this clause do not apply with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on of the Contractor’s activities (41 CFR 60-1.5).  (c)(1) The Contractor shall not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin. However, it shall not be a violation of this clause for the Contractor to extend a publicly announced preference in employment to Indians living on or near an Indian reservation, in connection with employment opportunities on or near an Indian reservation, as permitted by 41 CFR 60-1.5.    108  AFI52-105  23 JUNE 2015 (2) The Contractor shall take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin.
