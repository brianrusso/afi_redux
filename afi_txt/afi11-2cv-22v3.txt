SUMMARY OF CHANGES This document has been substantially revised and must be thoroughly reviewed.  Major changes include a change to radar altimeter requirements, new operating restrictions for the standby flight instruments, Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) operations for combat contingencies, and  single  engine  (OEI)  planning.    The  en  route  planning  procedures  for  low-level  operations were  redefined  with  altitude  restrictions.    Also  included  are  aircrew  briefing  procedural requirements,  dust  mitigation  methods  during  onload/offloading  procedures,  and  checklist guidance for tactical onload/offload operations.  Operating guidance on the use of interim power was added.  CV-22 aircrew are now authorized the use of Suite of Integrated Radio  Frequency Countermeasures  (SIRFC)  training  software.    Finally,  a  caution  was  added  to  prevent  the inadvertent actuation of the emergency landing gear blowdown system.  Tier requirements have been annotated.  Chapter 1—GENERAL INFORMATION    1.1.

(T-1)   10  AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015 Chapter 2 COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2) 2.1.  General.  The AFSOC C2 system is based on the principles of centralized monitoring and decentralized  control  and  execution.    The  result  is  a  C2  mechanism  which  keeps  the  AFSOC Commander (CC) informed of the  current  status  of AFSOC forces while enabling the Wing or Group Commander to exercise control over day-to-day operations. 2.1.1.  Waiver request will be the responsibility of the C2 agency with the operational control of the mission.  All waivers will be coordinated through Stan/Eval channels.  (T-2) 2.2.  Command and Control.  AFSOC is designated as the controlling agency for United States Special  Operations  Command  (USSOCOM)-assigned  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Forces (SOF) aircraft, while Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs) have Operational Control (OPCON) of theater-based assets.  (T-2)   In practice, responsibility for planning and  executing AFSOC missions is routinely delegated to the Wing or Group Commander.  The Wing or Group Commander,  in  turn,  exercises  control  of  non-close-  hold  missions  through  the  command  post supporting the wing or group.  In the event that assigned forces undergo a Change of Operational Control (CHOP), responsibility for mission monitoring passes from the wing or group C2 facility to  the  gaining  command.    (T-3)    Changeover  will  be  accomplished  IAW  the  pertinent Operational Plan, Operational Order, or deployment or execution order.  (T-2) 2.3.  Waiver and Approval Authorities. 2.3.1.  Wg/CCs or equivalent hold waiver/approval authority for items normally authorized at or below wing level.  (T-3) 2.3.1.1.  Deployments. 2.3.1.2.  Air Apportionment Allocation Conference taskings. 2.3.1.3.  Joint Air Apportionment Allocation Conference (JAAAC) taskings. 2.3.1.4.  Joint  Combined  Exchange  Training  (JCET)/Counter  Narcotics  Training missions. 2.3.1.5.  Other  specified  missions  as  tasked  via  the  SOF  Air  Tasking  Order  (ATO)  in Special Operations Forces Applications (SOFAPPS). 2.3.1.6.  Continental  United  States  (CONUS)  and  Outside  the  Continental  United  States (OCONUS) forces depart a Theater Special Operations Command (TSOC)/Joint Special Operations  Air  Component  (JSOAC)  Area  of  Responsibility  (AOR)  en  route  to  United States Northern Command (NORTHCOM) AOR. 2.3.1.7.  Air Reserve Component (ARC) forces (under Title 10). 2.3.1.8.  Depart  home  station  for  AFSOC-directed  contingencies/deployments/exercises (under Title 10). 2.3.2.  Operational  waivers  will  be  coordinated  through  Stan/Eval  channels  (T-2)    Waiver requests will normally be the responsibility of the C2 agency with the operational control of the mission.  (T-2) AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015   11  2.3.3.  Wg/CC  OPCON  terminates  when  forces  enter  a  TSOC/JSOAC  AOR  and  picks  up when forces exit a TSOC/JSOAC AOR. 2.4.  Mission  Monitoring.  The  AFSOC  Operations  Center  monitors  all  off-station  AFSOC aircraft  via  Theater  Battle  Management  Core  Systems  (TBMCS)  –  Execution  Status  and Monitoring (ESTAT), the Global Decision Support System (GDSS2), Theater Situation Reports, and aircrew Deployed Status Reports (DSR).

(T-3) 4.2.  Responsibility.  The  final  responsibility  regarding  required  equipment  for  a  mission  rests with the aircraft commander.  (T-2)  If one aircraft commander accepts an aircraft to conduct a mission or mission segment with a degraded or inoperative item or system, this acceptance does not commit that aircraft commander, or a different aircraft commander, to subsequent operations with  the  same  item  or  system  inoperative.    (T-2)    When  the  aircraft  commander  considers  an item  essential,  designate  the  component  mission  essential  (ME)  on  the  AFTO  Form  781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, and the item will be repaired or replaced prior to departure.  (T-3) 4.2.1.  If  a  land  as  soon  as  practical,  possible  or  immediately  condition  exists  while  the aircraft is on the ground, a takeoff should not be attempted unless conditions warrant (threat, remote location, repair capability, etc.) (T-3) 4.2.2.  The  radar  altimeter  will  be  operational  for  LVAs,  live  Alternate  Insertion/Extraction (AIE), and all night low-level events.  (T-3) 4.3.  Environmental Control System. 4.3.1.  Environmental  Control  System  (ECS).    If  environmental  conditions  permit,  the aircraft may be flown without  ECS.  Crew comfort,  type of mission, and length  of mission should be considered when deciding whether or not to proceed. 4.4.  Electrical  Systems.  If a variable frequency  generator (VFG) fails at  an en route stop,  the mission may continue to a destination with repair capability.  (T-3)  Required en route stops are authorized.  (T-3)  Loss of a single VFG and/or converter with no other system failures will not adversely  impact  the  electrical  system  and  flight  may  be  continued  at  the  discretion  of  the aircraft commander. 4.5.  Fuel  Systems.  Flight  crews  will  reduce  trapped  fuel  from  fuel  calculations  and  will consider center of gravity (CG) limits during degraded fuel system operations.  (T-3)  Consider potentially trapped fuel (CG limits) and decreased range should further degradation occur. 4.5.1.  Fuel  Pumps.    All  suction  lift  pumps  and  boost  pumps  will  be  operational  prior  to departure.  (T-3) 4.5.2.  Operations will not be conducted with any malfunction in the fuel system that affects the fuel quantity warning system, except on life or death missions. 4.6.  Landing Gear.  If a landing gear malfunction is encountered, that cannot be resolved with flight  manual  guidance,  only  a  full  stop  landing  will  be  made.    (T-3)    The  discrepancy  will  be corrected  prior  to  the  next  flight.    (T-3)    Exception:    If  repair  capability  does  not  exist  and  a positive  determination  is  made  that  further  flight  can  be  accomplished  with  the  gear  down  and   22  AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015 locked, the aircraft may be flown to a destination where repair capability exists provided the gear is not moved from the down and locked position.  (T-3)  Required en route stops are authorized.  Takeoffs and landings should be minimized and made from a hover. 4.7.  Navigation Systems.  The aircraft will not be flown with more than one inertial navigation system  (INS)  failure  as  this  would  remove  any  redundancy  in  the  aircraft  attitude  indicating system and flight control system.  (T-3) 4.7.1.  Global  Positioning  System.    Without  an  operating  GPS,  (INS  only)  navigation  in  all environments  is  severely  degraded  and  requires  constant  vigilant  monitoring  and  frequent updates  to  ensure  the  INS  solution  is  within  operating  limits.    Without  a  functioning  GPS, precision events  such as  LVA, night  water hoist etc., should not  be attempted.  When GPS operation is in question, an enhanced interrupted alignment should be accomplished. 4.8.  Cockpit Displays.  If the standby attitude indicator, standby flight instrument (SFI), or any of  the  standby  pitot-static  instruments  are  inoperative,  the  aircraft  may  only  be  flown  in  day visual meteorological conditions (VMC).  (T-3)  Flight in night VMC is permitted if night vision goggles (NVG) are used. 4.8.1.  As  a  minimum,  one  operating  multi-function  display  (MFD)  is    required  for  each pilot's position with both Display Electronic Units (DEU) operational.  (T-3)  With only one DEU  operational,  the  side  corresponding  to  the  operating  DEU  must  have  both  MFDs operational and at least one on the nonoperational side.  (T-3) AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015   23  Chapter 5 AIRCRAFT SECURITY 5.1.  General.  This  chapter  provides  guidance  on  aircraft  security  and  combating  the  unlawful seizure (hijacking) of a CV-22 aircraft.  Aircrew will actively resist all attempts to hijack aircraft.  Aircrews will not release information concerning attempts or identify armed aircrew members to the public.  (T-1) 5.2.  Security.  CV-22  aircraft  are  considered  Protection  Level  (PL)  3  aircraft  CONUS  and OCONUS.    There  capability  does  warrant  a  higher  protection  level.    This  security  priority designation  applies  to  operational  aircraft  worldwide.    Some  aircraft  contain  equipment  and documents which require protection per DOD 5200.1, DOD Information Security Program and AFI  31-401,  Information  Security  Program  Management.    Requirements  for  protection  of  the aircraft in a transient status at US and foreign bases are found in AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense. 5.3.  Procedures.  Pre-mission  planning  should  ensure  that  adequate  en  route  security  is available.    The  amount  of  protection  required  will  vary,  depending  on  the  location  and  ground time.  The aircraft commander will receive a threat assessment and security capability evaluation briefing  at  home  station  and  can  receive  updates  at  en  route  command  posts.    (T-3)    During scheduled  and  unscheduled  landings  at  non-USAF  installations,  the  aircraft  commander  will assess the situation and take the following actions, if necessary: 5.3.1.  Area Patrol.  Obtain area patrol coverage from local security forces to include backup response.  (T-3)  If local authorities request payment for this service, use AF Form 15, USAF Invoice.    (T-3)    If  unable  to  obtain  local  security  forces,  direct  armed  crew  members  to remain with the aircraft to maintain surveillance over aircraft entrances and activities in the vicinity  of  the  aircraft.    (T-3)    Acquire  a  means  to  report  suspicious  or  hostile  activity  to security forces (e.g., land mobile radio).  (T-3) 5.3.2.  Departure  which  extends  FDP  or  without  crew  rest.    If  local  security  forces  are unacceptable/unavailable and the crew is not augmented with security forces, the OG/CC or COMAFSOF  may  extend  maximum  FDP  up  to  2  hours  provided  the  mission  requirements justify  the  risk.    (T-3)    If  unable  to  depart  the  location  due  to  a  system  malfunction, coordinate through home base channels to acquire security support. 5.4.  Arming  of  Crew  Members.  Unit  commanders  may  direct  arming  of  crew  members  as deemed  necessary  by  mission  threat  analysis.    During  all  operations  where  weapons  are  on board,  arm  a  weapon  qualified  aircrew  member.    (T-3)    Protect  these  weapons  and  others installed  IAW  AFI  31-117,  Arming  and  Use  of  Force  by  Air  Force  Personnel  and  AFMAN 31229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual. 5.4.1.  Loading  and  Transfer  of  Weapons.    Load  and  unload  weapons  at  approved  clearing barrels, if available.  (T-3)  Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer of loaded weapons to another crew member; place the weapon on a flat surface.  (T-3) 5.4.2.  Wearing of Weapons.  Wear weapons in holsters.  (T-3)  If possible, conceal weapons to  protect  the  identity  of  armed  crew  members.    Do  not  wear  weapons  off  the  flight  line except to and from operations, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities (e.g., base operations, passenger terminals, flight line cafeteria, etc.).  (T-3)  When an aircraft   24  AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015 is  located  outside  the  United  States  in  a  foreign  country,  do  not  carry  any  weapon  off  the aircraft  unless  the  pertinent  Air  Force  MAJCOM  or  combatant  commander  authorized  the bearing of firearms.  (T2) 5.4.3.  Weapons Storage In-Flight.  Arm crew members before beginning preflight or onload duties.  (T-3)  When no passengers are aboard, weapons may be stored in a gun box in flight.  Re-arm before landing.  Do not unload weapons when placing them in a gun box.  (T-3) 5.4.4.  Weapons Storage at Deployed Location.  During crew rest, store weapons in the most secure  facility  available,  normally  the  base  armory.    (T-3)    If  a  weapons  storage  facility  is unavailable  or  the  country  prohibits  or  restricts  the  entry  of  weapons,  secure  firearms  and ammunition in the gun box.  (T-3) 5.4.5.  Aircraft  Without  a  Secure  Gun  Box.    If  an  aircraft  without  a  gun  box  must  remain overnight  at  a  location  where  a  government-owned  storage  facility  is  unavailable,  use  the nearest  acceptable  facility.    (T-3)    Acceptable  storage  facilities  are  US  and  allied  military services armories, US Reserve and National Guard armories, and US civil law enforcement armories.    If  none  of  these  are  available,  or  the  aircraft  commander  believes  security  of weapons may be compromised, secure the weapons in quarters, but one armed crew member must remain with the weapons.  (T-3) 5.4.6.  Passengers  will not  carry  weapons or  ammunition  on their person or in hand  carried baggage  aboard  the  aircraft  except  combat  personnel  during  operational  missions,  special agents,  guards of the Secret  Service or State  Department,  and other individuals specifically authorized to carry a weapon.  (T-3) 5.4.6.1.  If any of the above personnel need to clear their weapons, direct them to use the following procedures, (T-3): 5.4.6.1.1.  Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet (ft) from any aircraft, equipment, and personnel before un-holstering or un-slinging any weapon. 5.4.6.1.2.  Clear weapons IAW standard safety procedures. 5.4.7.  Ramp  Mounted  Weapon  System  (RMWS)  Custodial  Responsibility  during  Off-Station  Training  Missions.    The  aircraft  commander  will  assume  custodial  responsibility, delegated  to  the  flight  engineer,  of  the  RMWS  during  off-station  training  missions  that require  the  RMWS to  be  installed,  and  live-fire  operations  are  not  anticipated.    (T-3)    This responsibility  includes  remove/install,  pre-flight,  post-flight,  and  storage  of  the  RMWS.  Prior to departure, the FE will utilize an AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, to sign out the  weapon  from  weapons  maintenance  personnel.    Weapons  storage  will  be  IAW Paragraph 5.4.4/5.4.5.  (T-3) 5.4.7.1.  If  live-fire  operations  are  anticipated  during  off-station  training  missions, weapons  maintenance  personnel  will  assume  custodial  responsibility  and  perform  all required maintenance for the RMWS.  (T-3) 5.5.  General  Hijacking  Guidance.  (Ref. IAW AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking)). 5.6.  Aircraft  Force  Protection  Risk  Assessment  Matrix.  The  aircraft  commander  may  use Table 5.1 to help assess the risk to parked aircraft unattended by crew when located at overseas civilian  airfields.    A  cumulative  score  of  less  than  55  suggests  that  normal  unmanned  aircraft AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015   25  security measures may be adequate.  A score of 55 to 80 suggests that adequate security could be provided by deployed US ground personnel working 24-hour operations.  If the cumulative score is greater than 80, commanders should consider deploying or using contractor security personnel.  Consideration of Table 5.1 is not intended to preclude consideration of other possible factors or supplant  the  discretion  of  the  aircraft  commander’s  judgment  and  discretion  in  meeting  his responsibility  to  ensure  adequate  aircraft  security  measures  will  be  accomplished.    During unscheduled or emergency landings, the aircraft commander should contact the US Embassy or United States Defense Attaché Office (USDAO) for security assistance. Table 5.1.

Flight  Planning  Systems.  The  primary  flight/mission  planning  system  is  the  Special Operations Forces Planning and Rehearsal System (SOFPARS).  (T-2)  SOFPARS is a subset of the  Air  Force  Mission  Support  System  (AFMSS)  that  includes  the  Portable  Flight  Planning Software  (PFPS).    The  core  mission  planning  software  in  conjunction  with  V-22-specific modules  and  hardware  interfaces  is  known  as  the  V-22  Mission  Planning  System  (VMPS).  Upgraded  or  new  versions  of  SOFPARS  and  VMPS  will  be  released  and  authorized  by  the AFSOC/A3  for  use  after  applicable  testing  has  been  completed  (OPR:    AFSOC  Computer Systems  Flight/Digital  Dagger  (CSF/SCP)).    (T-1)                    Note:    Charts  are  defined  as  flight information publication (FLIP) products; maps are printed from mission planning. 6.1.1.  Electronic Data Transfer.  Aircrews will not use unapproved versions of any system to load  aircraft  avionics  without  AFSOC  CSF/SCP  approval.    (T-1)    AFSOC  CSF/SCP  will periodically publish a listing of approved systems. 6.2.  Coordinates.  The following procedures will be used:            Note:  Aircrew will confirm a common datum with their supported personnel during the mission planning process.  Failure to plan  navigation/LZ  using  a  common  datum  may  result  in  errors  of  up  to  several  miles.  Computer-based mission planning systems and aircraft navigation systems generally use WGS84 as reference datum.  Attempt to comply with CJCSI 3900.01C, 30 June 2007 whenever possible to minimize confusion.  WGS84 is the official DOD positional reference system. 6.2.1.  When reporting or receiving positions using coordinates derived from maps, charts, or related  cartographic  products,  a  complete  reference  to  the  source  of  the coordinates  will  be provided.  This reference will include the datum map or chart producer, series, sheet number, edition, and date.  (T-3) 6.2.2.  When  reporting  or  receiving  positions  using  coordinates  derived  from  non-cartographic  sources  such  as  GPS  receivers,  Analytical  Photogrammetric  Positioning Systems  (APPS),  or  related  systems,  a  complete  reference  to  the  source  of  the  coordinates will  be  provided.    This  reference  will  include  the  datum,  method  used  to  derive  the coordinates, agency producing the coordinates, and accuracy of the coordinates. 6.3.  Flight  Logs.  Prepare  a  MAJCOM  approved  flight  log  form  for  each  mission  and  include the  following  as  a  minimum:    turn  points,  headings,  distances,  estimated  time  en  route  (ETE), minimum safe altitudes (MSA), and fuel computations.  (T-2)  A flight log is not required if the above information is included on the map. 6.4.  Mission Kits. 6.4.1.  The following items will be on-board the aircraft for all missions.  (T-3)  Publications, excluding  navigation  charts  and  FLIP,  or  FLIP  equivalent  and  Flight  Manual  Pocket Checklists  may  be  in  electronic  form  as  long  as  suitable  equipment  is  on  board  and  easily accessible.    Local  area  functional  check  flights  require  only  an  aircraft  flight  manual  on-board.    (T-3)    Aircrew  members  will  carry  a  paper  copy  of  the  Flight  Manual  Pocket Checklist on all flights.  (T-3)   28  AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015 6.4.2.  Mission/Navigation  kits  weighing  less  than  200  lbs  may  be  secured  with  seat  belts.  (T-3) 6.4.3.  Units may supplement kits.  The following items will be included.  (T-3): 6.4.3.1.

(T-3) AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015   29  6.5.2.1.3.  TF/TA  Operations  During  Combat  or  Contingency.    TF/TA  procedures during  combat  or  contingency  operations  are  allowed  when  weather  minimums  are less  than  stated  in  Paragraph  6.5.2.1.1  with  COMASFOF  or  equivalent  approval.  (T-3) 6.5.2.2.  IFR Minimums.  Use category A approach minimums and comply with AFI 11-202, Vol 3, helicopter weather minimums and procedures unless local or theater specific weather  minimums  are  more  restrictive.    (T-2)    Instrument  meteorological  conditions (IMC) TF flight may be accomplished on published IFR Military Training Routes (IR) or other approved, surveyed training routes. 6.6.  Wind Limits. 6.6.1.  Comply with limitations in CV-22 Flight Manual (T-1) 6.7.  Illumination and NVG Requirements.  WARNING:  Lack of sufficient illumination may prevent  NVG  contour  operations  in  otherwise  VMC  conditions.    WARNING:    NVGs  worn  in black hole conditions can lead to induced motion illusions and spatial disorientation. 6.7.1.  NVG low-level operations require sufficient illumination to safely identify terrain and hazards commensurate with aircraft speed and altitude. 6.7.2.  The  decision  on  whether  sufficient  illumination  exists  to  complete  the  mission  rests with the aircraft commander. 6.7.3.  Any  training  or  operational  low-level  flight,  as  defined  by  Paragraph  7.1,  planned when the effective illumination (regardless of methodology or measurement) is forecast to be less  than  10%,  incur  greater  risk;  during  these  periods  of  low  illumination,  these  missions require: 6.7.3.1.  An additional level of Operational Risk Management (ORM). 6.7.3.2.  For  training  flights:    an  operational  TF  radar  or  FLIR,  and  moving  map  with Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) loaded are required.  (T-3) 6.7.3.3.  For  operational  flights:    flight  may  be  conducted  with  all  systems  listed  in Paragraph  6.7.3.2  degraded  or  inoperative,  if,  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  it  can  be determined  that  the  increased  mission  risk  is  still  commensurate  with  mission  benefit.  (T-3) 6.7.3.4.  Crossing  Mean  Sea  Level  (MSL)  altitudes  based  upon  lowest  altimeter  setting will be calculated and annotated for climbs greater than 500 ft.  (T-3) 6.8.  Adverse  Weather  Planning.  Flight  in  the  vicinity  of  thunderstorms  will  be  conducted IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3, and appropriate MAJCOM supplement’s fixed-wing procedures.  (T-2) 6.8.1.  Planned  flight  in  the  vicinity  of  thunderstorms  requires  an  operable  weather  (WX) radar.  (T-2) 6.8.2.  Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 ft) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.  If unable  to  clear  thunderstorms  or  cumulonimbus  clouds  by  at  least  2,000  ft  vertically, maintain the following clearance, (T-2): 6.8.2.1.  20 nm at or above FL 230.   30  AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015 6.8.2.2.  10 nm below FL 230. 6.8.2.3.  5  nm  for  tactical  low-level  operations.            CAUTION:    Aircraft  damage  is possible 20 nm or more from any thunderstorm. 6.8.3.  Avoid prolonged flight in areas of high lightning potential, i.e., clouds within ± 5,000 ft of the freezing level or ± 8° C of the freezing level, and in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with thunderstorm activity. 6.9.  Fuel  Planning.  The following fuel planning figures are intended to meet the requirements of AFI 11-202, Vol 3.  (T-2) 6.9.1.  For all flights VFR or IFR, plan to land at destination in accordance with AFI 11202, Vol 3, or 1,500 pounds, whichever is greater.  (T-2) 6.9.2.  For  flight  planning  purposes,  fuel  requirements  for  descent,  approach,  and  missed-approach will be no less than 1,200 pounds.  (T-2) 6.9.3.  Aircraft Commanders will declare "Minimum Fuel" when fuel calculations indicate a landing  at  the  intended  destination  below  1,500  lbs.    (T-2)    "Emergency  Fuel"  will  be declared  when  fuel  calculations  indicate  a  landing  at  the  intended  destination  below  1,200 lbs.  (T-2) 6.10.  Single Engine (OEI) Planning.  For VFR operations, aircrews will mission plan to ensure their  airplane  (APLN)  mode  OEI  service  ceiling  will  provide  adequate  terrain  clearance,  or sufficient escape options, for the route to be flown should an engine fail.  (T-3)  OEI level flight capability in VTOL/CONV is not required when vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL)/conversion (CONV)  flight  will  only  be  conducted  for  transitory  periods  in  conjunction  with  takeoff  and landing.  (T-3)  Group CC/COMAFSOF approval is required for extended or en route operations in VTOL/CONV if 500 ft above ground level (AGL) OEI capability is not available.  (T-3) 6.11.  En Route Planning.  Crews should fly missions at the highest altitude commensurate with the threat environment.  Where operations will be conducted below 3,000 ft AGL, the following are required on mission planning documents: 6.11.1.  Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA).  ESA is an altitude that will provide positive terrain clearance in IMC during situations that require the exiting of the low-level environment.  (T-3)  To compute ESA, add 1,000 ft (2,000 ft in mountainous terrain) to the highest obstacle or terrain  feature within 10 nm  of route centerline or intended flight  path,  rounded to  the next 100-foot increment.  Use of area ESA is recommended whenever possible; however, a single ESA is sufficient when there are no significant changes in topography. 6.11.2.  Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA).  MSA provides terrain clearance and limited threat avoidance during situations that require the interruption of low-level  operations.  (T-3)  To compute MSA for each leg or leg segment, add 500 ft (or the planned set clearance for TF operations) to the elevation of the highest terrain or obstacle within 3 nm of route centerline or the planned flight path, and round up to the next 100-foot increment. 6.11.2.1.  To  compute  MSA  during  aerial  refueling,  add  1,000  ft  to  the  elevation  of  the highest terrain or obstacle within 5 nm of route centerline or the planned flight path, and round up to the next 100-foot increment.  (T-3) AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015   31  6.11.3.  A properly chummed map for avoidance of all man-made obstacles.  (T-3)       Note:  During  training  operations,  higher  weather  or  altitude  minimums  may  be  dictated  by  FLIP, international  civil  aviation  organization  (ICAO)  procedures,  or  training  considerations.  Mountainous  areas  are  defined  as  having  a  500  ft  change  in  surface  altitude  over  1/2  nm.    WARNING:  Failure to maintain an accurate altimeter setting during flight may cause lower than planned terrain clearances or impact with terrain when using the computed ESA/MSA. 6.12.  Aeronautical Chart Preparation. 6.12.1.  Map  Selection.    Maps  with  a  scale  of  1:500,000  or  greater  detail  are  required  for lowlevel  operations.    (T-3)    Maps  with  a  scale  of  1:250,000  or  greater  are  highly  desired.  AFTTP  33.CV-22  Combat  Aircraft  Fundamentals  contains  specific  map  symbology  and route requirements. 6.12.2.  Pilots will carry a properly prepared map on all flights and ensure all maps used for flight have the most current hazards posted.  (T-3)  Pilots will not rely solely on the digital map  for  navigation  when  digital  map  hazard  information  does  not  match  printed  maps.  Aircrew  will  also  ensure  appropriate  civil  airspace  is  annotated  along  their  route  of  flight.  (T-3) 6.13.  Pre-Mission Briefing Requirements. 6.13.1.  Use the applicable briefing guides in AFI 11-2CV-22, Vol 3, CL-1 for briefings.  The aircraft commander will ensure their crews receive a briefing prior to each mission, covering all specific areas to be accomplished.  (T-3)  Units may convert AFI 11-2CV-22, Vol 3, CL-1 briefing items to electronic briefing formats if desired or as defined in unit standard operating procedures (SOP). 6.13.2.  If critical pre-mission duties conflict  with the briefing, the aircraft commander may excuse crew members.  Prior to engine start the aircraft commander will give a mission brief to any excused crew members detailing all areas pertinent to their duties.  (T-3) 6.13.3.  The aircraft commander will brief, if known, the following factors anytime a landing in a remote landing zone is anticipated: 6.13.3.1.  Weather.

(T-2)  Aircraft Commanders will ensure all crew members have read and signed off  all  FCIF/FCIS,  operations  notes,  or  mission  specific  read  files.    (T-3)    This  does  not relieve individuals from ensuring that required sign-offs are completed.  (T-3) 6.14.2.  If electronic FCIF record is not used, i.e., Patriot Excalibur (PEX), then update FCIF Currency  Record  (or  MAJCOM  equivalent  form)  and  squadron  read  file  manually,  if  new material has been added to the FCIF since the last review.  (T-2)  Legibly enter the last FCIF item  number,  the  current  date,  and  initial  the  FCIF  Currency  Record.    Initialing  the  FCIF Currency Record certifies review of all items. 6.14.3.  The  aircraft  commander  will  ensure  any  crew  members  joining  a  mission  en  route receive an FCIF update.  (T-3)  Instructor pilots who fly with senior officers are responsible for briefing FCIF items.  (T-3) 6.14.4.  Crew  members  not  assigned  or  attached  to  that  unit  will  certify  FCIF  review  by entering  the  last  FCIF  number  and  their  initials  behind  their  name  on  the  file  copy  of  the flight authorization or their ACM orders.  (T-3) 6.15.  Flight  Plans.  MAJCOM approved forms are authorized for use in lieu of DD Form 175, Military  Flight  Plan,  or  DD  Form  1801  for  local  area  flights  that  end  at  either  the  base  of departure or at an installation under the operational control of the base of departure.  (T-2) 6.15.1.  Annotate aircraft type on all flight plans as V22.  (T-2) 6.16.  International  Procedures.  The  aircraft  commander  will  review  the  USAF  Foreign Clearance Guide and brief crew members on applicable items before flights outside the CONUS.  (T-1)   Comply  with  customs,  immigration,  agriculture,  immunization,  and  quarantine requirements.    The  unit  dispatching  the  mission  is  responsible  for  border  clearance  and  other special  clearances  when  required.    (T-3)    Entry  into  foreign  countries  by  personnel  and AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015   33  equipment  is  directed  by  military  agreements,  diplomatic  agreements,  and  directives  of  the operational control commander, ICAO standards, and the Foreign Clearance Guide. 6.16.1.

For electronic  devices  not  listed,  the  user  will  provide  the  aircrew  a  letter  from  the  Aeronautical Systems  Division,  Deputy  for  Engineering  (ASC/ENAE),  2530  Loop  Road  West,  Wright Patterson  AFB  (WPAFB)  OH  45433-7101,  DSN  785-8928  or  (937)  785-8928  certifying  the device  is  approved  for  airborne  use.    (T-3)    If  the  aircrew  detects  any  interference  from  an electronic device used aboard the aircraft, discontinue the use of this device for the duration of the flight.  (T-3) 7.26.  Jamming and Interference.  All aircrews and other radio users must be familiar with the procedures for reporting incidents of meaconing, intrusion, jamming, and interference (MIJI) or spectrum  interference  (SI).    (T-3)    Info  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Air  Warfare  Center (AFSOAWC) on all MIJI/SI reports.  (T-1) 7.27.  Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. 7.27.1.  Conduct  hot  refueling  IAW  AFI  11-235,  Forward  Area  Refueling  Point  (FARP) Operations, TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding, and appropriate flight manuals.  (T-2)  The guidance in this section supplements the procedures outlined  in  TO  00-25-172,  Ground  Servicing  of  Aircraft  and  Static  Grounding/Bonding, appropriate  flight  manuals,  and  checklist.    A  comprehensive  mission  briefing  and  strict compliance with procedures will ensure an expeditious safe refueling operation. 7.27.2.  Rearming may be conducted in conjunction with hot refueling. 7.27.3.  Use the following guidance for aircraft marshaling during FARP operations: 7.27.3.1.  Hose deployment personnel will not be used to marshal aircraft.  (T-3)  When CCT/Special Tactics Squadron (STS) are responsible for primary ATC of an airfield, or are  responsible  for  ATC  operations  at  the  FARP  site,  they  will  marshal  and  control  all aircraft movement into and out of the FARP site.  (T-3)  If CCT/STS are not available, units are responsible for self-marshaling into and out of the FARP site.  (T-3) 7.27.3.2.  Land  just  prior  to  the  FARP  site  and  deplane  a  crew  member  to  marshal  the aircraft to the designated refueling point when able.  (T-3) 7.27.3.3.  If terrain features do not allow for landing just prior to the FARP site, aircraft will  hover  taxi  to  the  designated  refueling  point.    Be  aware  of  proprotor  downwash effects on personnel and equipment in the area. 7.27.3.4.  The  aircraft  commander  will  ensure  marshaling  procedures  outlined  in  the above paragraphs are briefed between the tanker and receiver aircraft prior to aircraft-to-aircraft  refueling  operations.    (T-3)    These  procedures  must  be  strictly  adhered  to  at  all times, ensuring all safety requirements are met. 7.27.4.  Transmissions  on  other  than  line  of  sight  (LOS)  and  satellite  communication (SATCOM) radios are prohibited.  (T-2) 7.27.5.  Aircrews will not  wear Gortex garments  within 50 ft of the aircraft when refueling with low flashpoint  fuels i.e., JP-4, Jet  B, AVGAS  etc.   Refer to  TO 00-25-172 for further information. 7.27.6.  In  the  absence  of  qualified  maintenance  personnel,  aircrew  may  service  aircraft hydraulic and oil systems IAW the PEDD.   42  AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015 7.27.7.  Personnel not directly involved in refueling operations will remain clear outside the fuel servicing safety zone.  (T-2) 7.28.  Forced  or  Precautionary  Landings.  If  the  crew  becomes  doubtful  of  the  aircraft’s airworthiness or encounters hazardous weather conditions preventing further flight, they should execute a precautionary landing, provided the landing conditions are not more hazardous than the in-flight  situation.   Aircraft  security  and  accessibility  for  maintenance  are  secondary considerations to aircrew safety.  Report all precautionary landings through the appropriate chain of command as soon as communications are established.  (T-3) 7.28.1.  When  the  forced  or  precautionary  landing  occurs  at  an  Air  Force  base  and  the maintenance issue has been investigated, corrected, and inspected by qualified maintenance personnel  and  the  aircraft  commander  has  determined  that  no  significant  operating  hazards exist at the departure base or en route, the aircraft commander may continue flight. 7.28.1.1.  The  operational  squadron  commander’s  approval  is  required  prior  to  further flight where qualified USAF maintenance is not available.  At the squadron commander’s discretion, this approval authority may be delegated to the aircraft commander. 7.28.1.2.  In  the  event  a  forced  or  precautionary  landing  occurs  at  a  location  where communications are not available, the following procedures apply: 7.28.1.2.1.  Remain at the landing site and await assistance if the aircraft commander determines the aircraft is not safe for flight. 7.28.1.2.2.  If  a  greater  hazard  exists  to  the  crew  or  aircraft  at  the  landing  site,  then continue to the nearest safe landing area.  (T-3)  The decision to resume flight under these circumstances should be based on a thorough evaluation of all the hazards and risks involved. 7.28.2.  Precautionary Landings Due to Weather. 7.28.2.1.  If  deteriorating  weather  is  encountered  during  VFR  operations,  consider reversing  course,  continuing  under  an  IFR  clearance  or  as  a  last  resort  executing  a precautionary landing. 7.28.2.2.  Further  flight  may  be  authorized  by  the  aircraft  commander  after  a precautionary  landing  for  weather.    Make  a  reasonable  effort  to  notify  appropriate agencies of the precautionary landing and to determine additional weather information. 7.29.  En Route Navigation and Instrument Approach Minimums. 7.29.1.  The  aircraft  navigation  system  is  cleared  for  area  navigation  point  to  point  (RNAV PTP)  in  CONUS  (RNP  4)  and  basic  area  navigation  (BRNAV)  procedures  in  European airspace  (RNP  5).    In  order  to  fly  RNAV  PTP  outside  the  navigational  aid  (NAVAID) navigation  criteria  listed  in  FLIP,  the  GPS  update  function  must  be  operational  and confirmation  that  the  INSs  are  accepting  the  GPS  update.    Flying  or  filing  RNAV  or  GPS approaches, RNAV standard instrument departure (SID) or RNAV standard terminal arrival route (STARS) is  not  approved.  (T-2)  Additionally, PTP  navigation is  not  allowed to  any point after the initial approach fix (IAF) on instrument approaches.  (T-2) 7.29.1.1.  Filing /I for the suffix of the TD code on the DD Form 175 in item 3 provides maximum flexibility in the ATC structure.  When filing the DD Form 1801, in item 10, AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015   43  Equipment  –  in  addition  to  identifying  all  available  and  serviceable  communication, navigation,  approach  aid  and  surveillance  equipment,  inserting  the  character  Z  is equivalent to /I on the DD Form 175.  In item 18, Other Information – insert RMK/PTP and NAV/RNVE99. 7.29.1.2.  Without  an  operating  GPS  or  GPS  update  function,  /I  may  still  be  filed  IAW GP; however, INS only navigation in all environments is severely degraded and requires constant  vigilant  monitoring  and  frequent  updates  to  ensure  the  INS  solution  is  within operating limits.  An EIA should be accomplished in this situation and ENAV procedures should be the primary method of navigation. 7.29.2.  With a GPS Monitor Fault posted, the GPS lateral  limit associated with  the current mode of flight has been exceeded and therefore RNAV procedures will revert to the ENAV capabilities  of  the  aircraft  (VOR/DME,    TACAN).    Refer  to  CV-22  Flight  Manual  for information on procedures.  When NAVAIDs are not used as the primary method of RNAV, crews  must  monitor  satellite  and  GPS  status  while  operating  under  RNAV  and  BRNAV procedures.  (T-2)    Note:  As the aircraft is not equipped with a database, extreme vigilance must be taken when entering in coordinates for a point that is not within NAVAID reception.  It is also possible to be cleared to a point not filed as part of the flight plan.  In this case if unable  to  locate  the  point,  request  clarification,  request  a  different  routing,  or  request  a heading until you are able to locate the point. 7.29.3.  Ceiling  Below  Minimums.    If  the  reported  ceiling  is  below  the  minimum  for  the approach, but the visibility value is at or above the authorized minimums before initiating an en route descent and approach, ensure fuel remaining is sufficient to accomplish the en route descent and approach, missed approach, and flight to alternate with appropriate reserves.  (T-2) 7.30.  Radar Altimeter Procedures. 7.30.1.  During low-level operations, set the radar altimeter to no lower than 80% of intended low-level altitude.  (T-3) 7.30.2.  For  instrument  approaches,  set  the  radar  altimeter  low  altitude  warning  to  the appropriate height  above touchdown (HAT) or height  above  aerodrome  (HAA) prior to  the final approach fix (FAF).  (T-3) 7.31.  Radar Advisories.  Participate to the maximum extent possible while operating in VFR or simulated IFR conditions.  (T-3) 7.32.  Advisory  Calls.  The  nonflying  pilot  will  make  advisory  calls  to  the  flying  pilot  as follows: 7.32.1.  Descent: 7.32.1.1.  Transition level.  (T-3) 7.32.1.2.  One thousand ft above assigned altitude.  (T-3) 7.32.1.3.  One thousand ft above initial approach fix or holding altitude.  (T-3) 7.32.2.  Non-Precision Approaches: 7.32.2.1.  One hundred ft above procedure turn and final approach fix altitude.  (T-3)   44  AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015 7.32.2.2.  One hundred ft above minimum descent altitude (MDA).  (T-3) 7.32.2.3.  "Minimums" at MDA.  (T-3) 7.32.2.4.  "Runway  in  sight."  Called  when  sufficient  visual  reference  with  the  runway environment is established and the aircraft is in a safe position to land.  (T-3) 7.32.2.5.  "Go  around."  Called  at  the  missed  approach  point  when  visual  reference  with the runway environment is insufficient to continue the approach or any time the approach becomes unsafe.  (T-3) 7.32.3.  Precision Approaches: 7.32.3.1.  One hundred ft above decision height (DH) or decision altitude.  (T-3) 7.32.3.2.  "Continue."  Call  at  DH  if  only  the  approach  light  system  is  in  sight  and  a determination cannot yet be made that the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing.  (T-3)   If  an approach is  continued below DH based on seeing the approach  lights  only (an approach  to  visibility  minimums),  "go-around"  must  be  called  by  100  ft  if  a determination to land cannot be made.  (T-3) 7.32.3.3.  "Land." Call at DH or later if runway environment is in sight and the aircraft is in a position for a normal landing.  (T-3) 7.32.3.4.  "Go around." Call at DH or later if the runway environment is not in sight or if the  aircraft  is  not  in  a  position  for  a  safe  landing.    (T-3)    If  an  approach  is  continued below DH based on seeing the approach lights only (an approach to visibility minimums), "go-around" must be called by 100 ft if a determination to land cannot be made.  (T-3) 7.32.4.  Climb out: 7.32.4.1.  Transition altitude.  (T-3) 7.32.4.2.  One thousand feet below assigned altitude.  (T-3) 7.32.5.  Any  crew  member  observing  unannounced  heading  deviations  greater  than  10°, airspeed deviations of 10 knots, altitude deviations of 100 ft during approach or 200 ft while en route, or potential terrain or obstruction problems will immediately advise the pilot flying.  (T-3)  Also, announce deviations from briefed procedures for the approach being flown.  (T-3) 7.33.  Power Checks. 7.33.1.  Aircrew  will  reconfirm  power  requirements  using  either  the  cockpit  management system  (CMS)  or  performance  charts  when  power  required  is  within  ten  (10)  percent  of power available.  (T-3) 7.33.1.1.  Takeoff and landing will be executed utilizing interim power at all times when interim power affords the greater power margin.  (T-3) 7.34.  Passenger Policy.  DOD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, establishes criteria for passenger  movement  on  DOD  aircraft.    AFI  11-401,  and  AFI  35-103,  Public  Affairs  Travel, provide  further  guidance  on  orientation  and  public  affairs  travel.    Refer  to  these  publications directly.

(T-3)    In  this  context, personnel  on  board  are  required  for  mission  accomplishment.    Limit  personnel  to absolute  minimum  required.    (T-3)    Other  mission  events  are  authorized.    (T-3)  Passengers  will  be  seated  with  belts  fastened  during  threat  maneuvers.    The  aircraft commander will ensure that supporting forces are briefed on the mission profile and mission events before flight.  (T-3) 7.35.  Passengers Occupying Crew Positions. 7.35.1.  The aircraft commander may authorize passengers to sit in the center seat.  (T-3) 7.35.2.  AFI 11-401 governs approval for passengers to occupy a crew position with a set of flight controls. 7.35.3.  Any passenger occupying a crew position must be on ICS.  (T-3) 7.36.  Personnel Restraints  (See Table 7  2). 7.36.1.  Aircrew.  All personnel must be restrained by the safest means possible for the type mission  being  flown.    (T-2)    Seats  will  be  available  for  all  passengers  not  covered  in Paragraph 7.34.2; passengers will be seated with seatbelts fastened for takeoff and landing and  will  not  be  unrestrained  when  any  door  is  opened  in-flight.    (T-2)    Additional  crew members  will  also  be  seated  as  stated  above  or  restrained  with  a  restraint  harness  (i.e., gunner’s belt) during takeoff and landing or operating near an open door.  (T-2)  At least one pilot  will  have  seat  belt  and  shoulder  harness  fastened  when  engines  are  running.    (T-2)  Crew members may perform duties that require them to be unrestrained for short periods of time, provided they are not in close proximity to an open door. 7.36.1.1.  The  preferred  method  of  unsecured  personnel  movement  in  the  cargo compartment for all phases of flight is with the ramp closed.  If the ramp must be open for  mission  requirements,  i.e.,  ramp  weapon  employment,  terminal  area  operations,  all passengers  and  crew  members  not  required  to  be  unsecured  for  the  mission  event  (i.e., AIE)  will  remain  restrained  by  either  a  seat  belt,  personal  restraint  device,  or  properly adjusted gunner's belt to prohibit inadvertent departure from the aircraft at all times with the ramp open.  (T-2) 7.36.2.  Combat  equipped  troops.    When  carrying  troops/teams  and  seats/seat  belts  are  not installed/used  due  to  mission  or  aircraft  load,  alternate  restraints  will  be  used  by  those personnel.  (T-3)  These restraints may not protect occupants in a crash sequence as well as a seat belt, but must be of such design to keep occupants from falling out of open doors.  (T-3)  Each individual will have a restraint to secure them to the aircraft.  (T-3) 7.36.3.  Alternate  loading  methods  used  should  allow  seats  and  equipment  not  required  for the  mission  to  be  removed.    Define  the  cabin  floor  itself  as  the  seat  and  either  a  seat  belt, snap link device, tie-down strap, or similar restraining device to restrain all occupants.  Brief all users on the type of restraining device installed.  (T-3)     Note:  Additional aircrew may be secured with alternate restraints. 7.36.3.1.  Alternate    restraints  will  be  IAW  USSOCOM  Manual  350-6,  Special Operations Forces Infiltration/Exfiltration Techniques.  When early release is authorized IAW USSOCOM Manual 350-6, restraints will not be removed until as late as practical prior to the landing/assault (no earlier than the 1-minute call).

Obtain  customs,  agriculture,  and  public  health  clearance,  as  required,  prior  to opening any doors other than the crew door or enplaning and deplaning personnel.  (T-2) 7.37.2.  Proceed directly from the aircraft to customs, immigration, or agricultural inspection for  processing  at  those  stations  where  federal  or  local  inspections  are  required.    (T-2)    The flight engineer or the aircraft commander completes the necessary forms before reporting to inspectors.  (T-3) 7.37.3.  After clearing with border clearance agencies, the pilot or flight engineer will return to the aircraft for off-loading and other post-flight procedures.  (T-3) 7.37.4.  A US military aircraft is a sovereign instrument.  When cleared to overfly or land in foreign  territory,  it  is  US  policy  to  assert  that  military  aircraft  are  entitled  to  the  privileges and immunities which customarily are accorded warships.  These privileges and immunities include,  in  the  absence  of  stipulations  to  the  contrary,  exemption  from  duties  and  taxation; immunity  from  search,  seizure,  and  inspections  (including  customs  and  safety  inspections); or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel, equipment, or cargo on board.  USAF aircraft commanders will not authorize search, seizure, inspection, or similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by direction of USAF or the American Embassy in the country concerned.  (T-3) 7.37.5.  The aircraft commander will not permit the inspection of their aircraft by officials of any foreign government.  (T-3)  If requested to do so, the aircraft commander and crew will deny access and seek aid from the senior AFSOC representative or US Embassy or consulate within  the  host  nation.    (T-3)    Inform  customs  or  other  officials  of  the  above  policy  and request  that  they  confirm  their  request  through  their  own  government  and  with  US Department of State representatives.  (T-3)  If necessary, the aircrew will seal the aircraft and enter  into  crew  rest,  and  relay  departure  intentions,  until  resolution  of  the  matter  by appropriate authority.  (T-3)  Use communications by the fastest  means available to  inform command and control facilities should this situation occur.  (T-3) 7.37.6.  When  confronted  with  a  search  request  by    foreign  authorities,  aircrews  should consider the following procedures: 7.37.6.1.  In  most  cases,  search  attempts  may  be  stopped  by  a  statement  of  the  aircraft commander to the foreign officials that the aircraft is a sovereign instrument not subject to  search  without  consent  of  USAF  or  the  chief  of  mission  in  the  country  concerned.  AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015   49  This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign authorities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft. 7.37.6.2.  If  foreign  authorities  insist  on  conducting  a  search,  the  aircraft  commander must negotiate to delay the search until contact is made with USAF (through MAJCOM C2)  or  the  appropriate  embassy.    (T-3)    The  aircraft  commander  should  unequivocally state,  the  aircrew  has  no  authority  to  consent  to  the  search  and  that  they  must  relay  the foreign request to these agencies for decision.  The aircraft commander should then notify these  agencies  of  the  foreign  request  by  the  most  expeditious  means  available.  Thereafter,  the  aircraft  commander  should  follow  instructions  provided  by  the appropriate embassy and USAF. 7.37.6.3.  If  foreign  officials  refuse  to  desist  in  their  search  request,  the  aircraft commander should indicate that they would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel and mechanical considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission to do so. 7.37.6.4.  If permission  is  refused and the  foreign authorities insist  on forcing their way on board an aircraft, the aircraft commander should state that he/she protests the course of action being pursued and that he/she intends to notify both USAF and the appropriate American Embassy of the foreign action.  The aircraft commander should then allow the foreign agents on board the aircraft, without physical resistance, and thereafter report the incident to USAF and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. 7.37.7.  In  all  instances,  specific  instructions  may  be  briefed  because  of  sensitive  cargo  or equipment.    These  instructions  and  applicable  provisions  of  classified  supplements  to  the foreign clearance guide should be followed where applicable. 7.38.  Utilization  of  Civilian  Law  Enforcement  or  Medical  Personnel.  Generally,  before transporting  civilian  law  enforcement  officials  or  civilian  medical  personnel,  obtain  proper authorization  through  installation  commander,  MAJCOM,  or  USSOCOM.    (T-3)    Civilian  law enforcement or medical personnel may be required to perform duties at an accident site.  These duties may include death determination or human remains removal.  Local and international laws may affect mission prosecution and should be reviewed prior to deployment or pickup of civilian personnel.  The primary method of deploying or recovering civilian law enforcement or medical personnel is by landing.  (T-3)  Civilian law enforcement or medical personnel may be deployed and  recovered  by  hoist  provided  all  other  transport  resources  have  been  examined  and determined to be inadequate and approval is obtained from the Group CC or COMAFSOF.  (T3)  Prior to hoist deployment, brief civilian law enforcement or medical personnel on all applicable procedures  and  safety  and  emergency  considerations  involved.    (T-3)    If  unable  to  contact  the controlling  agency  for  approval,  the  aircraft  commander  may  approve  the  carrying  of  civilian personnel on life or death missions when it is determined that these passengers are essential for the  successful  completion  of  the  mission.    Commanders  will  not  transport  civilian  law enforcement  personnel  into  areas  of  imminent  danger  or  where  confrontation  with  civilian criminal targets is likely, and will not direct the action of civilian authorities in enforcing the law or making arrests.  (T-1) 7.39.  Crew Debriefing.   50  AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015 7.39.1.  Training    Missions.    The  aircraft  commander  will  conduct  the  debriefing  and complete the appropriate documentation.  (T-3) 7.39.2.  Operations  Under  Combat  Conditions.    Each  aircrew  participating  in  operations under actual combat conditions will participate in an intelligence debriefing.  (T-3) 7.39.3.  Commanders  will  ensure  that  all  aircrews  are  debriefed  immediately  following  a combat or combat support mission during which any tactics or procedures were observed that may affect other operations.  (T-3) 7.39.4.  The aircraft commander encountering hostile fire will submit an immediate airborne report  to  their  controlling  agency  followed  by  a  hostile  fire  incident  report  to  intelligence immediately after landing.  (T-3) 7.39.5.  Other Missions.  The aircraft commander has the responsibility of affording to each crew member the opportunity to discuss unusual aspects of the mission.  (T-3)  Debriefings may be formal or informal, as the situation requires. 7.40.  Hazardous  Material  Procedures.  The  term  hazardous  material  includes  any  material, which, because of its quantity, properties, or packaging, may  endanger human life or property.  Procedures in this paragraph apply whenever aircraft carry DOD Hazard Class/Division 1.1, 1.2, or  1.3  explosives,  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT)  Class  A  and  B  poisons,  etiological  or biological research materials, radioactive materials requiring yellow III labels, and inert devices.

(T-3) 7.41.  Hazardous Medical Equipment: 7.41.1.  Nonstandard  equipment  possessed  by  medical  facilities  that  use  AFSOC  air evacuation  services  should  be  regarded  as  potentially  hazardous.    Two  types  of  equipment are of major concern: 7.41.1.1.  Electronic  medical  equipment  produces  electromagnetic  interference  (EMI) which  is  commonly  beyond  the  limits  specified  by  MIL  STD  461A  and  462,  and therefore can interfere with aircraft communication and navigational equipment. 7.41.1.2.  Therapeutic  oxygen  systems  present  an  increased  hazard  of  fire  or  explosion.  A  potential  hazard  is  the  inadvertent  disruption  of  the  cylinder  neck,  manifold,  or regulator resulting in explosion and propulsion of the container or accessories. 7.41.2.  For nonstandard electronic medical equipment, take the following precautions: 7.41.2.1.  Pararescue  personnel  must  inform  the  aircraft  commander  when  nonstandard electronic medical equipment is brought on board the aircraft.  (T-3) 7.41.2.2.

(T-3)  Only three personnel at a time are allowed past the ramp hinge due to CG limits.  (T-3) 9.3.1.  A  cutting  device  will  be  readily  available  to  cut  ropes  or  AIE  devices  in  case  of emergencies or rope entanglement.  (T-3) 9.3.2.  Equipment that is certified as training use only will not be used for live personnel.  (T-3) 9.3.3.  Aircrew will ensure all operations off the ramp will not exceed aircraft CG limits.  (T-3) 9.3.4.  Mission Briefing.  Prior to deployment or pickup, the aircraft commander will ensure the  appropriate  briefing  for  the  planned  alternate  insertion  and  extraction  operations  is completed.  (T-3)  Aircrew and team briefings will emphasize proper hand signals, time calls, and emergency procedures.  (T-3) 9.3.5.  The  crew  member  at  the  deploying  station  will  ensure  the  departing  team  members have  removed  any  potential  restraints  (ICS  connections,  personnel  restraints,  etc.)  prior  to deploying.  (T-3) 9.3.6.  Hoist. 9.3.6.1.  Inspect  the  entire  length  of  the  hoist  cable  any  time  a  live-hoist  is  anticipated.  (T-3) 9.3.6.2.  Ground  the  hoist  to  discharge  static  electricity  to  prevent  personnel  on  the ground or water from sustaining a shock.  (T-3)  Do not ground the hoist near spilled fuel.  (T-3) 9.3.6.3.  The hoist operator will wear a heavy, work-type glove or equivalent on the hand used to guide the hoist cable and have eye protection in place.  (T-3) 9.3.6.4.  Complete the hoist operator’s checklist prior to final approach.  (T-3) 9.3.6.5.  If  the  survivor  is  attached  to  a  parachute,  hover  at    an  adequate  distance  to prevent the rotor wash from billowing the parachute and dragging the survivor.  (T-3) 9.3.6.6.  Hoist Equipment. 9.3.6.6.1.  Forest Penetrator. 9.3.6.6.1.1.  Do not use the hoist to relay messages except when all other possible means  of  communications  (i.e.,  radio,  message  streamer,  tag  line)  have  been exhausted.  (T-3) 9.3.6.6.1.2.  All  crew  members  must  be  vigilant  for  shock  loads  to  the  cable.    If shock loading is observed, cease live hoist operations.  (T-3)  Inspect hoist, and if necessary, replace the cable prior to the next mission.  (T-3) 9.3.6.6.1.3.  While  conducting  live  hoist  operations  during  training,  if  the  cable contacts  the  aircraft,  operations  will  cease  until  a  visual  check  of  the  cable  is complete  and  no  defects  are  noted.    (T-3)    During  contingencies  the  decision  to   58  AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015 continue operations rests with the hoist operator and the pilot in command.  (T-3)   Note:    During  water  operations,  the  dynamic  action  of  waves  increases  the potential  for  shock  loading.    Additionally,  the  increased  drag  of  the  stokes litter/personnel in the water increases the total force applied to the cable. 9.3.6.6.1.4.  The description and maintenance instructions for the forest penetrator are  contained  in  TO  14S6-3-1,  Forest  Penetration,  Rescue  Seat  Assembly,  PN K26-1000-5,-9 (Kaman), and TO 00-25-245, Operations Instructions Testing and Inspection Procedures for Personnel Safety and Rescue Equipment, Section IV. 9.3.6.6.1.5.  The forest penetrator can be used to recover unresponsive or injured personnel safely with the exception of those with back injuries. 9.3.6.6.1.6.  It  is  possible  to  recover  three  people  at  once  with  the  penetrator.  However, this should only be done when time is critical since it may exceed the hoist load limit of 600 lbs. 9.3.6.6.2.  Stokes Litter. 9.3.6.6.2.1.  The description and maintenance instructions for the stokes litter are contained in TO 00-75-5, Use, Inspection and Maintenance Stokes Rescue Litters.  The stokes litter is designed to hold a survivor immobile in a horizontal position.  The sides of the litter protect  the survivor from  bumping against obstructions or the side of the aircraft during retrieval.  Configure the stokes litter with the sling, flotation devices, three restraining belts, and tag line when stowed on the aircraft.  (T-3) 9.3.6.6.3.  Horse Collar (Rescue Strop). 9.3.6.6.3.1.  The horse collar can be used for single occupant recoveries from land or water.  The horse collar can only be used to recover ambulatory personnel. 9.3.6.6.4.  Tag Line. 9.3.6.6.4.1.  Tag Line.  The tag line reduces the time spent in a hover and prevents pendulum  or  spinning  motion  during  hoisting.    It  should  be  used  to  guide  the recovery device to or from confined areas, such as ship rigging, trees, etc.  It may also be used to pass messages or transfer small items to or from the aircraft. 9.3.6.6.5.  Rescue Net. 9.3.6.6.5.1.  The rescue net is constructed of a stainless steel tube frame and 5/16- inch  polypropylene  netting.    The  net  weighs  approximately  20  pounds.    A  sea anchor  drogue  is  provided  to  position  and  stabilize  the  net  and  allow  for  flight path corrections.  The sea anchor drogue may be replaced by a 10-foot line with a 3-  to  5-pound  bag  of  shot  for  stability.    The  rescue  net  is  particularly  useful  for recovery of personnel not familiar with the forest penetrator and/or rescue strop. Because entry is easier and more rapid for a survivor than a forest penetrator, it is perhaps  the  best  device  for  recovery  of  survivors  from  frigid  waters.      The disadvantage is the size of the device. 9.3.6.7.  During  training  missions,  terminate  live  hoisting  immediately  at  the  first indication  of  equipment  malfunction.    (T-3)    If  possible,  return  the  individual  to  the AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015   59  surface as soon as possible by lowering the device or reducing hover height.  (T-3)  For actual search and rescue (SAR) missions, existing circumstances must dictate actions to be  taken.    The  hoist  operator  will  advise  the  pilot,  check  hoist  power  sources  and  hoist controls.  (T-3) 9.3.6.8.  During  a  water  hoist  pickup  it  may  be  advantageous  to  extend  the  cable  and displace the aircraft such that the survivor is not in an area of extreme downwash while preparing to  be lifted.   Once the survivor is  ready for hoisting,  establish the hover over the rescue device and lift the survivor(s) straight up out of the water.  (T-3) 9.3.6.9.  Unconscious  Survivor  Recovery.    If  it  is  determined  that  the  victim  is unresponsive  or  unable  to  employ  the  rescue  device,  lower  someone  trained  in  hoist operations to aid the injured or unresponsive survivor.  The deployed crew member will secure  the  survivor  for  hoisting  and  give  a  thumbs  up  visual  signal  to  indicate  that  the survivor is ready for pickup.  (T-3) 9.3.7.  Rappelling.  WARNING:  The crew member at the deploying station will ensure that the ropes reach the ground prior to final positioning of rappellers for deployment.  (T-3)  The crew  member  at  the  deploying  station  will  coordinate  with  the  pilot  to  ensure  the  aircraft maintains  a  hover  altitude  that  will  keep  the  ropes  in  contact  with  the  ground.    (T-3)  WARNING:    When  an unsafe  condition  is  encountered,  stop  any  additional  team  members deploying from the aircraft.  (T-3)  Make no attempt to physically stop a person in the act of deploying as this may cause the person to lose grip of the rope and increase the probability of injury to the team member.  (T-3) 9.3.7.1.  Maximum rappelling altitude for training is 100 ft.  (T-3) 9.3.7.2.  Do  not  deploy  ropes  until  the  aircraft  is  in  a  stable  hover  over  the  intended deployment area.  (T-3) 9.3.8.  Fast Rope.  WARNING:  The aircraft commander is responsible for ensuring that all crew  members  are  aware  of  the  length  of  the  ropes.    (T-3)    Failure  to  do  so  may  result  in serious  injury  to  deploying  personnel  or  damage  to  the  aircraft.    WARNING:    When  using ropes with heavy attachment hardware (such as a metal sleeve and ring), ensure all personnel are clear below the aircraft before releasing the rope.  (T-3)  WARNING:  Fast rope must be coiled toe to head.  (T3) 9.3.8.1.  The aircrew will install ropes and inspect attaching points.  (T-3) 9.3.8.2.  Configure  handrails  down  the  sides  of  the  cabin  as  described  in  A1-V22AB-CLG-000/1V- 22(C)B-9, Cargo Handling Manual V-22 Tiltrotor.  (T-2) 9.3.8.3.  Water  Fast  Rope  Operations.    Deploy  the  fast  rope  upon  entering  the  insertion zone.  (T3)  A 2-4 knot forward drift will assist in deployment of teams and prevent them from  landing  on  each  other  and  possible  injuries.    (T-3)    Once  personnel  are  deployed, slowly climb and accelerate to allow recovery of the rope prior to high speed flight (if not released) .  (T-3) 9.3.9.  Special Patrol Insertion and Extraction (SPIE) Operations. 9.3.9.1.  During  SPIE  operations  do  not  exceed  70  knots  indicated  airspeed  (KIAS)  (50 KIAS in cold weather).  (T-3)   60  AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015 9.3.9.2.  A minimum of 200 ft of clearance will be maintained between the bottom of the SPIE assembly and any ground obstacles, tactical situation permitting.  (T-3) 9.3.9.3.  The aircraft will have an operable radar altimeter.  (T-3) 9.3.9.4.  Maximum  flight  time  with  personnel  on  the  rope  is  15  minutes.    (T-3)  WARNING:  Extreme care must be taken while making an approach to a high hover with a very slow rate of descent  during the insertion to  avoid  the possibility of encountering power settling.  (T-3) 9.3.10.  Helocast  Operations.    Utilize  the  BEFORE  LANDING  checklist  with  gear  up  to prepare  the  aircraft  for  a  water  approach.    (T-3)    CAUTION:    Use  extreme  caution  when silencing  the  landing  gear  warning  horn  to  ensure  the  emergency  blow  down  switch  is  not activated. 9.3.10.1.  Safety Requirements. 9.3.10.1.1.  All night water helocast approaches as well as all live deployments (day and night) require a safety boat or a hoist equipped (or extra life raft) rotary wing or tilt  rotor  cover  ship  with  30  min  of  loiter  fuel,  in  radio  contact,  and  within  visual range of the operation to be present.  (T-3) 9.3.10.1.2.  The  preferred  coverage  is  with  a  safety  boat  present  in  the  water operations  area.    (T3)    The  safety  boat  should  be  clearly  marked  (such  as  an  IR strobe) and in communication prior to helocast operations.  Safety boat location and communications plan must be coordinated prior to conducting the first low and slow.  (T-3)  Positive communication with the cover ship and/or safety boat is required.  (T-3) 9.3.10.1.2.1.  Aircraft will call ON THE APPROACH and OUT OF THE SPRAY on interplane and safety boat frequencies.  (T-3) 9.3.10.1.3.  If  a  safety  boat  is  not  available,  a  cover  ship  with  an  operable  hoist  or extra raft will suffice.  (T-3)  The cover ship crew must be qualified to deploy the raft or  conduct  hoist  operations,  have  1  hour  of  loiter  time,  and  maintain  radio  contact with the helocast aircraft.  (T3) 9.3.10.2.  Helocast  deployments  will  be  conducted  at  a  maximum  of  10  ft  above  water level (AWL) and 10 KGS.  (T-3)  Personnel will exit the aircraft from the ramp.  (T-3)  The aircraft will have an operable radar altimeter and hover symbology prior to helocast operations.  (T-3) 9.3.10.3.  Prepare  the  rescue  hoist  for  extraction  to  the  max  extent  possible  prior  to personnel deployment in the event an injury occurs to the departing team.  (T-3) 9.3.10.4.  Boat Deployment.  WARNING:  Combat rubber raiding craft (CRRC) center of gravity  limitations  will  be  discussed  during  both  team  and  aircrew  briefings.    (T-3)  Failure to ensure adequate distribution of the team’s equipment may result in an aft CG causing the craft to become near vertical during deployment.  Equipment and gear must be securely attached inside the boat.  (T-3) 9.3.10.4.1.  Reference  USSOCOM  MAN  350-6,  Special  Operations  Forces Infiltration/  Exfiltration  Techniques,  Chapter  9/10,  for  maritime  operations  and AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015   61  USSOCOM  MAN  350-4,  Vol  2,  Combat  Rubber  Raiding  Craft  Operations,  for approved boats. 9.3.10.4.2.  Army  or  Navy  personnel/boat  deployment  limit  is  Sea  State  4  (17-21 knots/3.8-5.0 average wave height).  Reference USSOCOM MAN 350-4, Vol 2, Sea State Chart, Appendix D. 9.3.10.4.3.  Boat/Raft configuration.  The crafts may be laced to plywood or suitable material that will roll easily on the aircraft rollers.  Many boat types must be partially deflated  and  strapped  to  fit  within  the  cabin  width.    Compressed  air  may  be configured to completely inflate the boat after deployment. 9.3.10.4.3.1.  The boat may be loaded bow or stern first.  Secure with at least two cargo  tie-down  straps  per  boat,  with  a  short  bow  or  stern  line  attached  to  the aircraft.  (T-3) 9.3.10.4.3.2.  During  the  approach,  after  completing  conversion,  team  members and crew members will prepare the boat for drop by removing the primary cargo tie-down  straps.    (T-3)    The  bow  or  stern  line  will  remain  attached  until  pilot flying indicates the aircraft is within parameters for deployment.  (T-3) 9.3.11.  Belay Operations. 9.3.11.1.

Human  Remains.    AFSOC  and  AETC  crews  do  not  remove  human  remains  from crash or incident sites except as provided in the subparagraph below.  (T-2)  Do not commit resources  to  body  removal  until  the  mission  approving  or  releasing  authority  has  been informed of the request  and the attendant circumstances, and has authorized the removal of the remains.  (T-2) 9.7.1.1.  Military  Personnel.    If  the  crash  or  incident  site  is  on  a  military  reservation  or within military jurisdiction, the remains of military personnel shall be removed only with the approval of a medical officer.  (T-3)  In the absence of a medical officer at the crash or  incident  site,  approval  must  be  obtained  from  the  proper  military  medical  authority prior  to  removal  of  remains.    (T-3)    If  the  crash  or  incident  site  is  not  within  military control, jurisdiction over the remains rests with the civil authorities.  (T-3)  In such cases, do  not  remove  remains  unless  authorized  by  the  appropriate  civil  official  (usually  the local coroner or medical examiner).  (T3) 9.7.1.2.  Civilian Personnel.  The remains of civilian personnel employed by the military are recovered as stated above.  (T-3)  Remains of other civilians may be removed IAW applicable laws of the jurisdiction, after authority has been obtained.  (T-3) 9.7.1.3.  Exceptional  Cases.    Within  the  United  States  and  in  extreme  situations  where time is critical and communications are impossible, the aircraft commander may, with the approval of the appropriate civil official, remove remains and deliver them to the proper civil  authorities.    (T1)    This  procedure  is  authorized  only  if  conditions  already  make  it impossible to obtain timely approval  from  the mission approving or releasing authority.  (T-1)  Whenever this procedure is employed, the aircraft commander should comply with any state or local laws or regulations affecting the transport of human remains. 9.7.2.  Civil Appointments.  AFSOC personnel will not, at any time, accept appointments as deputy coroner.  (T-2) 9.7.3.  International Aspects.  A mission requiring the removal of human remains, military or civilian, across international borders, will involve national as well as local law.  (T-1)  Prior to such operations, consult the United States diplomatic officials to the concerned countries to obtain necessary clearances for the operation.  (T-1) 9.7.4.  Safeguarding  Aircraft  Wreckage.    Reference  AFI  91-204,  Safety  Investigations  and Reports.    If  first  on  the  scene,  establish  security  until  properly  relieved.

This appendix provides procedures to standardize preparation and presentation of operation orders. A3.2.  Scope.  These  procedures  apply  to  all  CV-22  units  assigned  or  attached  to  conduct joint/combined operations. A3.3.  General. A3.3.1.  Conduct  operation  order  (OPORD)  briefings  to  allow  adequate  preparation  of individual maps and time for necessary crew coordination.  (T-3) A3.3.2.  Conduct  update  briefs  prior  to  departure  to  relay  changes/additions  to  mission, weather, or to verify time hack, etc.  (T-3) A3.3.3.  Each unit will conduct detailed flight briefings and verify crew understanding (brief- backs) of all aspects of the mission.  (T-3) A3.3.4.  Designate  planning  cells;  exempt  members  from  unnecessary  duties  during  the planning phase.  (T-3)  Clearly delineate duties to cell members.  (T-3) A3.3.5.  When possible, the Commander's representative (Flight Lead [FL]) will prepare and conduct the mission briefing.  (T-3)  All phases of the operation will be briefed in detail.  (T-3) A3.3.6.  Portions  of  the  OPORD  that  do  not  apply  to  a  given  mission  need  not  be  briefed. Ground  Force  Commanders  or  their  representatives  should  be  present  to  field  related questions, monitor changes, and validate plans. A3.3.7.  Augment briefings with appropriate diagrams and charts.  (T-3) Construct diagrams as accurately as possible.  Charts or diagrams not depicted to scale should be labeled as such. Additional guidance on the preparation of charts and diagrams can be found in Annex C.   86  AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015 Table A3.1.  Charts/Kneeboard Handouts/Chart Kneeboard. A3.3.8.  Briefing  Media.    The  standard  for  presentation  of  a  deliberate  mission  briefing  is prioritized as follows:  (This may not be possible during Crisis Action Planning due to time constraints.) A3.3.8.1.  Computer  generated  slide  presentation  augmented  by  required  maps  and charts.  Always  back  up  the  computer  slide  show  with  sufficient  charts.    (T-3)    The  Air Mission  Commander  (AMC)  and  mission  briefer  should  determine  the  minimum requirement for backup media.  A3.3.8.2.  Opaque projector (Elmo) to project packet material. A3.3.8.3.  Overhead slides supplemented with maps and charts. A3.3.8.4.  Posters developed with poster maker from kneeboard handouts. A3.3.8.5.  For in extremis type briefings, use of kneeboard items is acceptable. A3.4.  OPORD/Mission Briefing Format. A3.4.1.  The Navy Time Clock number is DSN 762-1401. A3.4.2.  TIME  HACK.    The  time  hack  will  be  given  prior  to  beginning  the  OPORD.    This gains the attention of the crews and stops all activity among them.  The time hack will be the same  one  given  by  the  supported  units  (usually  the  ground  commander).    The  time  hack should be given in the following format: A3.4.2.1.  "IN  1  MINUTE  IT  WILL  BE  1900  ZULU/LOCAL.  "  "TURN  ALL PAGERS AND CELL PHONES OFF/SILENT." A3.4.2.2.  "IN 30 SECONDS IT WILL BE 1900 ZULU/LOCAL.  " A3.4.2.3.  "IN 10 SECONDS IT WILL BE 1900 ZULU/LOCAL.  " A3.4.2.4.  "5, 4, 3, 2, 1, HACK, 1900 ZULU/LOCAL.  " A3.4.3.  ROLL CALL. AFI11-2CV-22V3  12 JUNE 2015   87  A3.4.4.  CLASSIFICATION. A3.4.5.
