Award  Description.  In  1985,  the  President  of  the  United  States  established  the  CINC’s Annual Award for Installation Excellence to recognize the outstanding efforts of the people who operate and maintain Department of Defense installations and who have done the best with their resources  to support  the  mission.  The award  encourages commanders to  create an environment that  promotes  innovative  and  creative  ways  of  enhancing  base-level  services,  facilities,  and quality-of-life. 2.2.  Award Eligibility.  The competitive period is the 12-month fiscal year (October 1 through September  30)  preceding  the  year  in  which  the  award  is  presented  (e.g.,  the  2016  award  is presented  in  May  of  2016,  based  on  performance  in  fiscal  year  2015).  The  previous  year’s Installation  Excellence  Award  winner  cannot  compete  for  the  current  award  year.  The  AF presents the award in two categories: 2.2.1.  Installation  Excellence  Award.  All  major  and  minor  installations  are  eligible.  All units,  including  tenants  attached  to  the  installation,  compete  together  as  part  of  the  host installation. 2.2.2.  Special  Recognition  Award.  All  individuals,  organizations,  teams,  units,  offices, projects,  programs,  and  major  installation  events  assigned  to  the  finalist  installations  may submit nomination packages. 2.3.  Award Criteria. 2.3.1.  Installation Excellence Award. Each Major Command (MAJCOM) may nominate one installation  within  its  organizational  structure  to  compete  for  the  Installation  Excellence Award.  Using  the  functional  areas  listed  in  paragraph  1.1.5.  as  headings,  packages  should show  how  the  nominee  introduced  innovative  programs  that  helped  create  and  sustain excellent  base  operations  during  the  nomination  period.  For  those  areas  not  functional specific, an additional heading titled “Other Activities” may be used and is to be part of the overall score. Specific achievements during this period should explain how the installation: 2.3.1.1.  Improved the work environment or physical plant 2.3.1.2.  Improved the quality of life 2.3.1.3.  Enhanced productivity of the work force 2.3.1.4.  Increased customer satisfaction or improved customer service 2.3.1.5.  Encouraged bottom-to-top communication and team problem solving 2.3.1.6.  Promoted unit cohesiveness and recognized outstanding individual efforts 2.3.1.7.  Initiated sustainable practices according to Executive Order 13693: Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade 2.3.2.  Special Recognition Award. Once the installation finalists are announced, both bases may nominate up to  30 individuals, organizations, teams, units, offices,  projects, programs, and major installation events for the Special Recognition Award. MAJCOMs should review all  submissions  to  ensure  only  those  deserving  consideration  are  submitted  to  the  AF/A4C AFI36-2831  13 SEPTEMBER 2016   7  Awards Program Manager for IESB review. Specific achievements during this period should explain how the nominee(s): 2.3.1.1.  Significantly  enhanced  the  installation’s  working  conditions,  quality  of  life,  or customer service. 2.3.1.2.  Achieved improvement, greater efficiency, or higher standards through focusing on innovation as opposed to excelling at normal duties. 2.3.1.3.  Warrant recognition by the SECDEF. 2.4.  Suspense.  Entries  for  the  Installation  Excellence  competition  are  to  be  submitted  to  the AF/A4C  Awards  Program  Manager  the  last  Friday  in  October.  Special  Recognition  packages from the two finalist installations are to arrive one week prior to the first day of IESB travel. All nomination packages are to be submitted electronically in bullet format on the current version of the  AF  Form  1206.  Installation  Excellence  nominations  should  not  exceed  two  pages  for  the nomination (front and back of one AF Form 1206) and one page for acronyms for a total of three pages.

Phase  I.  The  FEWG  reviews  and  scores  the  Installation  Excellence  nomination  packages from a functional perspective and develops recommendations for the IERC. 2.5.1.  The FEWG members score each nomination package from a functional perspective as described in paragraph 1.1.5. There  may be cases  where  an installation will not  have every functional area; therefore, the AF/A4C Awards Program Manager and FEWG Chair should ensure a competitive score is awarded based on a total average score for that function. After the FEWG members have scored their functional areas and submitted an electronic copy of their  score  sheet,  the  FEWG  should  meet  as  a  working  group  under  the  direction  of  the FEWG  Chair  to  consolidate  evaluations  and  build  a  decision  brief  recommending  the  two finalists to the IERC. 2.5.2.  AF/A4C Awards Program Manager serves as the facilitator during the scoring process and acts as the liaison between the FEWG and the IERC.   8  AFI36-2831  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 2.5.3.  The  IERC  is  to  review  the  FEWG’s  decision  brief,  consider  the  FEWG  functional evaluations and overall recommendations, and select the two finalists. The IERC should also recommend  three  wing  commanders  and  one  NAF  or  wing  command  chief  to  serve  on  the IESB that are not part of either finalist installations’ MAJCOM. 2.5.4.  Once the installation finalists have been announced, the parent MAJCOM is to collect and  screen  Special  Recognition  packages.  Nominations  meeting  the  criteria  outlined  in paragraph 2.3.2 and determined worthy of SECDEF recognition should be forwarded to the AF/A4C Awards Program Manager one week prior to the first day of IESB travel. 2.6.  Phase II.  The IESB conducts a two-day visit with each installation finalist to determine the Installation Excellence and Special Recognition Award winner(s). During the visit, the IESB is to  validate  and  approve  a  maximum  of  30  Special  Recognition  nominations  from  each  finalist installation. After the Installation Excellence Award winner is chosen, only the IESB-approved Special  Recognition  nominations  from  the  winning  installation  are  to  be  forwarded  for  final SECAF, CSAF, and/or respective designees for approval and signature. 2.6.1.  The  IESB  conducts  first-hand  observations  of  the  programs  that  create  and  sustain installation excellence. The IESB team members evaluate the designated areas listed in Table 2.2. Table 2.2.  Designated Evaluation Areas for IESB Visit Airman & Family Readiness Center Civil Engineering Communication & Information Contracting Education  Energy Logistics Public Affairs Environmental Maintenance Quality of Life* Fire Protection Major Tenants Safety Force Development Manpower/Personnel Security Forces Force Resiliency* Mission Support* Health Services Operations & Readiness Services Unit Morale* Housing   2.6.1.1.  The areas in Table 2 denoted with an asterisk are designated areas that may be evaluated  by  the  IESB  NAF  or  wing  command  chief  from  an  enlisted  perspective. Finalist installations are encouraged to showcase their enlisted force’s dedication to these areas  in  a  capacity  that  demonstrates  innovative  and  outstanding  programs  for  enlisted members.  2.6.2.  AF/A4C  Awards  Program  Manager  forwards  the  IESB’s  recommendation  for  the Installation Excellence and Special Recognition award winners to the CSAF and the SECAF for approval. 2.6.3.  After the CSAF and the SECAF approve the recommendations, the AF/A4C Awards Program Manager forwards the package to ODUSD (I&E). 2.6.4.  Once  authority  is  granted  to  release  the  names  of  Service  winners,  HAF/A4  should contact the MAJCOM/CV of both finalists and provide results. AFI36-2831  13 SEPTEMBER 2016   9  2.6.5.  AF/A4C  Awards  Program  Manager  is  to  prepare  a  funds  distribution  letter  and transfer the monetary incentive to the winner and runner-up. 2.7.  Description of Awards. 2.7.1.  Installation Excellence. The Secretary of Defense (or their respective designees) may honor each Service’s winning installation during a presentation ceremony at the Pentagon in Washington,  DC.

The following  items  are  presented  to  the  winning  installation  commander:  an  Installation Excellence Trophy, an Installation Excellence Flag, and a congratulatory letter signed by the President of the United States. 2.7.2.  HQ  USAF  may  provide  a  monetary  incentive  award  to  the  winner  and  runner-up installations’ Operation and Maintenance Account for future “quality-of-life” improvements. The monetary amount is subject to change based on evolving fiscal guidance. 2.7.3.  Special Recognition.
