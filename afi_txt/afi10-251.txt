Introduction.  This  instruction  provides  guidance  and  responsibilities  for  Air  Force MAJCOMs  that  are  engaged  as  the  Air  Component  for  joint  exercises  and  training.    This includes  Joint  and  Service  exercise  and  training  programs  accredited  within  the  JNTC.    The intent  is  to  provide  realistic  and  scalable  Joint/Combined  products,  processes  and  functionality appropriate  to  the  organizational  level  of  the  training  audience.    Depending  on  the  specific training program, exercise, or event, the training audience may range from the operational level of  the  Joint/Combined  Force  Commander  to  Airmen,  Soldiers,  Sailors,  and  Marines  at  the tactical level.  With consideration of funding and unit/personnel availability, this will present an accurate replication of a realistic and relevant Air Force Component participating in these Joint processes  is  essential  to  shape  the  sister-Services’  understanding  of  USAF’s  role  in  these processes,  as  well  as  promotes  understanding  of  our  air,  space  and  cyber  capabilities.    Overall this intent and instructions reinforces the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Vision for 2020 and interdependence of the Services. 1.1.1.  Air Force participation provides replication of an Air Force Component’s capabilities of air, space, and cyberspace power, utilizing established joint doctrine and processes.  The intent is to facilitate an understanding of the capability of airpower to the  training audience.  Effective synchronization of air, space, and cyberspace power effects into the ground scheme of  maneuver  and/or  maritime  employment  concepts  will  enhance  future  joint/combined contingency operations. 1.1.2.  Air Force control members include Highly Qualified Experts (HQEs), Observer Coach / Trainers (OC/T), Command and Control (C2) Trainers/Supervisors, Exercise Controllers, a GO Subject Matter Expert (SME) (COMAFFOR/JFACC), Modeling and Simulation (M&S) capabilities with associated databases and SME (COMAFFOR/JFACC) support, and a Chief of Airpower (CAP). 1.1.3.  The  replicated  Air  Force  Component  consists  of  a  mix  of  Air  Force  training audience(s)  who  accomplish  their  warfighting  functions,  and  response  cells  emulating various  elements  of  the  Air  Force  Component,  i.e.,  Joint/Combined  Air  Operations  Center (J/CAOC), the Joint Air Component Coordination Element (JACCE), when appropriate, and the  Expeditionary  Air  Support  Operations  Group  (EASOG)  with  subordinate  squadrons  to include an Air Support  Operations Center (ASOC), Tactical  Air Control Party (TACP) and Battlefield  Weather  (BW),  etc.    USAF  participants  may  be  designated  as  exercise  training audiences or response cells. (T-3) 1.1.4.  Specific requests for Air Force (training audience and or  response cell) participation will be submitted by each MAJCOM or Joint/Service users on an annual  basis utilizing the Joint  Training  Information  Management  System  (JTIMS)  to  Air  Combat  Command.  ACC/A3O7 will prioritize and provide process adjudication oversight through the Air Force Joint  Exercise  Coordination  Team  (AFJECT).    Failure  to  submit  a  request  for  support  in accordance  with  AFJECT  established  scheduling  criteria  will  result  in  no  support  being provided. AFI10-251  25 JUNE 2015   5  1.1.5.  Consistent with resource and fiscal  constraints, this instruction will provide levels of effort  to  properly  integrate  air,  space,  and  cyberspace  power  to  meet  AF  and  Joint/Service training objectives.  ACC will notify Sister Service Component Commands who request Air Force  support  before  the  exercise  main/mid  planning  conference/event  of  the  ability  to support  or  not  support  specific  events.    This  decision  will  be  educated  by  the  AFJECT process.    If  for  any  reason  subsequent  to  the  main/mid  planning  conference/event,  exercise support  is  expected  to  be  degraded  or  is  in  jeopardy  of  not  replicating  joint  processes  and functionality,  ACC,  in  close  collaboration  with  concerned  USAF  participating  units,  will assess viability of supporting the exercise.  If support is expected to be degraded to the point of  reinforcing  negative  learning  for  the  training  audience  (i.e.,  not  able  to  replicate  joint processes/functions), ACC will inform the Service Component Command that the event will not  be  supported.  Participating  MAJCOMs  will  publish  supplements  to  this  instruction  to further  define  operational, logistical  and  administrative  support  requirements  and responsibilities. 1.2.  Background.  The  Memorandum  of  Agreement  (MOA)  for  Army/Air  Force  Liaison Support,  dated  31  March  2012,  provides  Service  guidance  to  USA  and  USAF  ajor  Commands for Liaison duties during home station training, collective training, and deployed operations.  The objective  of  the  MOA  was  “to  increase  the  joint  capabilities;  identify  joint  interdependencies; and  standardize  air-ground  training,  equipment  interoperability  and  combat  operations  of  the USA  and  USAF.”    This  MOA  also  addresses  participation  within  USA  training  events  by  Air Component  functional  liaisons.    Subsequently,  the  Chief  of  Staff  of  the  Air  Force  (CSAF) promulgated additional guidance directing MAJCOMs to “provide a one or two-star Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) capable GO for all Corps and select Division-level MCTP exercises  that  occur  in  a  MAJCOM’s  respective  Area  of  Responsibility  (AOR).    Additionally, ACC  will  provide  a  tailored  AOC-trained  response  cell  to  support  the  GO  and  provide  the requisite level  of intelligence, strategy,  combat plans, and combat operations support necessary to adequately plan, supervise, and execute the air component portion of the exercise.”  This Air Force Instruction codified the MOA and CSAF guidance.  JTTI is a CSAF and Chief of Staff of the  Army  (CSA)  initiative  to  improve  air,  space,  and  cyberspace  power  fidelity  to  MCTP,  for USA  training  event  for  senior  commanders  and  their  staffs,  as  well  as  improving  ground component fidelity to AF operational-level exercises.  OSD’s JNTC initiative expanded the JTTI concept. 1.3.  Applicability  and  Compliance.  Active  component,  Reserve,  and  National  Guard units/personnel    replicating  elements  of  the  Air  Force  Component  or  as  part  of  the  AF contribution  to  exercise  planning  and  control  are  governed  by  this  instruction.    MAJCOM Directors of Operations are responsible for successful implementation of this instruction.   6  AFI10-251  25 JUNE 2015 Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.  HQ  USAF/A3OR  Responsibilities.

Notify  Sister  Service  Component  Commands  who  request  Air  Force  support before  the  exercise  main/mid  planning  conference/event  of  the  ability  to  support  or  not support specific events.   This  decision will be educated by the AFJECT process.    If for any  reason  subsequent  to  the  main/mid  planning  conference/event,  exercise  support  is expected  to  be  degraded  or  is  in  jeopardy  of  not  replicating  joint  processes  and functionality, ACC, in close collaboration with concerned USAF participating units, will assess viability of supporting the exercise. (T-3)  If support is expected to be degraded to the  point  of  reinforcing  negative  learning  for  the  training  audience  (i.e.,  not  able  to replicate joint processes/functions), ACC will inform the Service Component Command that the event will not be supported. 2.3.  MAJCOM  Responsibilities.  Provide  command  oversight  and  management  of  Air  Force participation in JTTI/JNTC and Service events.  MAJCOMs will: 2.3.1.
