Aircrew Training Policy (T-2). AFI11-2C-32BV1  26 OCTOBER 2015 9 1.5.1.  The  primary  training  method  for  C-32B  initial  qualification,  requalification, specialized,  upgrade  training  is  in-unit  training  using  AFSOC/A3VS  approved  SOI  and  AF Form  4111s.    Training  personnel  will  prepare  an  AF  Form  4109,  SOF/CSAR  Aircrew Training Record, prior to beginning unit-developed training.  (T-1) 1.5.2.  Training Records.  Use AF Form 4109 to document the qualification, re-qualification, specialized training, or upgrade of an aircrew member.  This record and attached forms will provide a chronological  record of qualification or upgrade training administered by the unit of assignment and serves as a syllabus.  It documents all applicable ground training, special function  training  and  flying  training  accomplished  by  an  aircrew  member.    Instructions  for completing and managing training records are contained in  Attachment  2 and AFI 11-202, Vol 1. 1.5.3.  Training  time  limitations.    C-32B  crew  members  should  start  initial  upgrade  or  re-qualification training within  60 days after  reporting  for duty unless formal  school  dates  are unavailable.    The  unit  will  notify  NGB/A3T  (cc  to  AFSOC/A3VS)  before  a  crew  member exceeds this limit.  (T-1) 1.5.3.1.  C-32B  crew  members  must  complete  in-unit  qualification  or  re-qualification within 120 days from the date of their first ground training session or flight (whichever occurs first).  Individuals unable to complete the training within this specified time limit may continue training, however, the unit must request an extension  from  NGB/A3T (cc to  AFSOC/A3VS) with  a description of the difficulty and an expected  completion date.   (T-1) 1.5.4.  The  number  of  training  tasks  in  the  initial  mission  qualification  or  upgrade  training guide  is  a  recommended  average  which  normally  allows  the  student  to  achieve  the  desired level  of  proficiency.    It  is  not  intended  to  restrict  the  number  of  times  a  task  may  be accomplished.    However,  if  in  the  judgment  of  the  unit  CC/DO,  excessive  flights  are required, refer to Paragraph 1.16. 1.5.5.  Proficiency  Advance  (PA).  Students  may  proficiency  advance  provided  all  Required Proficiency Levels (RPLs) are met or exceeded for the advanced (skipped) sortie(s)/lesson(s). The  unit’s  Operations  Officer  is  the  approval  authority  for  PA.  The  recommendation  and approval must be documented in the individual’s training record prior to the next flight/event.  Student will initial below the approving official's remarks on the AF Form 4110, Comments SOF/CSAR Training Record, to indicate acknowledgment of the proficiency advance.  (T-3) 1.5.6.  Individual  events  accomplished  during  satisfactory  completion  of  initial  mission  or upgrade  evaluations  may  be  credited  towards  the  individual's  currency  requirements.  Individual  events  accomplished  during  satisfactory  completion  of  an  instructor  certified upgrade  may  be  credited  towards  the  individual’s  currency  requirements  provided  the appropriate AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications, entry has been accomplished. 1.5.7.  Except  where  specifically  covered  by  this  instruction,  an  instructor  pilot  will  be  at  a set of flight controls during (T-1): 1.5.7.1.  All pilot mission qualification training. 1.5.7.2.

All aircrew members are authorized this publication.  This publication is available on the e-publishing website.  (T-2) 1.16.  Failure to Progress.  If a student fails to progress according to syllabus requirements, the unit  will  conduct  a  Progress  Review  Board  (PRB).    The  PRB  can  recommend  continuation  in training; or an AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, action; (e.g., a Flying Evaluation Board (FEB) to the unit commander).  The PRB, at a minimum, will  be  comprised  of  the  unit  DO,  Stan/Eval  Office,  Training  Office  and  a  senior  enlisted advisor.    The  contract  civilian  training  facility  will  identify  students  who  fail  to  progress  IAW the formal training syllabus (pilots only).  (T-2) 1.17.  Career  Enlisted  Aviators  (CEA).  CEA  in  the  C-32B  consist  of  Loadmasters  and Airborne  Mission  System  Specialists.    CEA  are  not  tied  to  AFI  36-2101,  Classifying  Military Personnel  (Officer  and  Enlisted),for  aircrew  qualification  upgrade.    All  enlisted  aircrew qualifications  are  separate  and  distinct  from  skill  level  qualification.    When  an  AF  Form  8  is completed for the applicable flight evaluation, then that crew member is qualified to perform all duties assigned to that crew qualification regardless of skill level.  Aircrew instructor and flight examiner  qualifications  are  also  separate  and  distinct  from  OJT  trainer  or  certifier  designation and are reflected in the Air Force Specialty Code by use of “K” prefix (aircrew instructor) and “Q” prefix (aircrew flight examiner).  (T-2) 1.18.  C-32B  Pilot  Designation  (PD)  Codes.  AFI  11-401,  defines  pilot  aviation  codes.  For standardization  and  upgrade  progression,  use  the  codes  in  Table  1.2  (3rd  and  4th  letter/number designators  are  used  to  distinguish  AAR  certification/qualifications  and  attached  staff  aircrew members).

Airland and AAR codes are independent.  Typical progression is UP, FP, FP3, FP2, MP2, IP2, and IP1.  PF AAR (contact) qualification (“2” status) may be completed before or after Aircraft Commander Certification.  (i.e., a Pilot might be an MP3 before MP2). 2.  Except for previously qualified C-32 aircraft commanders, all pilots will begin in a crew qualification of FP.  FP qualified pilots may fly in either left or right seat.  Theunit commander should take into consideration total flight time and previous aircraft flown to determine their initial qualification level.  OG/CC (or equivalent) is waiver authority for initial qualification level.  (T-3)   3. See Attachment 6, Table of Allowable Maneuvers for PF Qualification / Certification.  1.19.  Hiring Considerations.  Due to the unique mission of the C-32B, all aircrew members are selected  for  positions  based  on  their  military  background  and  experience.  At  a  minimum,  a potential aircrew member will have the following qualifications  (T-2): 1.19.1.  Pilots  candidates  will  have  completed  undergraduate  pilot  training  (UPT)  and  have been qualified on a previous USAF aircraft. 1.19.2.  Career  Enlisted  Aviator  (CEA)  candidates  will  meet  all  criteria  listed  in  the appropriate  Air  Force  Specialty  Code  (AFSC)  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan (CFETP) and have prior qualification at the 5 or 7 skill level in any previous USAF AFSC. 1.19.3.  150th  Maintenance  candidates  will  meet  all  criteria  listed  in  the  appropriate  Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) and have prior  qualification  at  the  5  or  7  skill  level  in  any  Aircraft  Maintenance  USAF  AFSC.

Overview.  This  chapter  outlines  the  minimum  requirements  for  mission  qualification training,  re-qualification  training  for  unqualified  periods  of  greater  than  two  years  and conversion  or  differences  training  for  pilots.    Required  mission  qualification  training  for  other aircrew members is contained in Chapter 3. 2.2.  General  Requirements.  Pilots  will  complete  a  formal  simulator  training  course  prior  to beginning in-unit mission qualification training.  (T-1)  2.2.1.  When simulator training is delayed, familiarization flights are authorized.  Pilots will be  coded  on  the  flight  orders  as  “UP”  and  fly  in  an  unqualified  status.    Unqualified  pilots who have not attended simulator training will not occupy a seat with a set of flight controls until  simulator  training  has  been  completed.    No  training  folder  entry  is  required  for familiarization  flights.    These  familiarization  flights  will  not  start  the  120  day  training completion  timeline.    Prior  to  the  first  flight,  all  items  in  Table  4.1  with  Note  1  attached, must be completed. 2.3.  Time Period for Qualification.  In addition to the requirements in Paragraph 1.5.3, pilots should  start  unit  qualification  training  within  60  days  of  the  completion  of  contract  simulator training.  The unit will notify NGB/A3T (cc to AFSOC/A3VS) before a crew member exceeds this limit.  (T-1) Section 2B—Prerequisites 2.4.  Training  Prerequisites.  Course  prerequisites  are  IAW  the  AFSOC/A3VS  approved  SOI, AF  Form  4111s,  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1,  and  this  instruction.    The  only  prerequisites  that  are  met prior to starting the formal simulator course are those required by the simulator training provider.  (T-2) Section 2C—Ground Training Requirements 2.5.

Basic Training Requirements.  Conversion  training  is  normally  associated  with  training  between  different Mission  Design  Series  (MDS).    Difference  training  is  normally  conducted  when  training  in  a different series aircraft in the same MDS.   Conversion training  results in an  aircraft  evaluation and difference training is usually completed with an instructor sign-off.  Use difference training when changing between same design aircraft and the amount of training needed for qualification does  not  warrant  attendance  at  a  formal  qualification  course.    Additionally,  accomplish difference  training  when  an  aircraft  is  modified and  required  training  for  that  modification  can easily be accomplished in-unit.  Conversion training requires the completion of the appropriate AF Form 4111, SOF/CSAR Training Record, and satisfactory completion of the applicable MDS written  qualification  examination.    After  conversion  training,  crew  members  will  maintain qualification as outlined in this chapter, at the discretion of the unit commander.

Prorate  individual  requirements  based  on  the  number  of  full  calendar  months left training  period  following  completion  of  certification,  qualification,  or requalification.  Use Table 4.2 to determine the number of sorties and events required for an individual after proration. in the 4.4.  Re-currency/Requalification  Training.  This  is  training  that  an  aircrew  member  must accomplish under the supervision of an instructor when currency/qualification has been lost.  (T-1)    The  event  resulting  in  re-currency  and  each  event  thereafter  are  creditable  for  the  currency training period.  Conduct requalification training under the supervision of an instructor or flight examiner when an aircrew member is non-current in excess of six months (unqualified).  (T-2) 4.4.1.  Basic and Mission Currency/Requalification.  Failure to accomplish basic or mission currency or volume items from Table 4.3 which are required every calendar month, 60 days, 90 days, or semi-annual period, results in the loss of basic or mission currency respectively.  Basic and mission re-currency/requalification training requirements are shown in Table 4.4.  Individual  proficiency  will  dictate  the  number  of  events  to  be  flown  with  an  instructor  or flight examiner to satisfy sortie delinquency (as a minimum, one sortie will be flown).  Pilots that  are  non-current  for  an  overseas  sortie  may  regain  currency  under  the  supervision  of  a current  and  qualified  aircraft  commander.    CEA  crewmembers  that  are  non-current  for  an overseas sortie may regain currency under the supervision of any current and qualified CEA of the same crew position. 4.4.2.  AAR Currency/Requalification.  Failure to accomplish  all AAR currency  events  that are required every semiannual period result in loss AAR currency.  Table 4.3 denotes which events result in loss of AAR currency; however, non-currency in excess of six months results in  loss  of  qualification.    Loss  of  AAR  currency  does  not  affect  basic  or  mission  currency.  AAR  re-currency/requalification  training  requirements  are  shown  in  Table  4.5.
