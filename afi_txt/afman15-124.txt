General.  This  chapter  gives  instructions  for  encoding  Terminal  Aerodrome  Forecasts (TAFs).  Air Force weather organizations specify, amend, and disseminate TAFs in accordance with AFI 15-128, Air Force Weather Roles and Responsibilities and AFMAN 15-129 Volume 1, Air and Space Weather Operations – Characterization. 1.1.1.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  forecast  elements  in  the  main  body  of  the  forecast  text (clouds, weather, wind, etc.) apply to the area within a 5 statute mile (8,000 meters) radius of the center of the aerodrome.  Specified weather between 5 statute miles (8000 meters) and 10 statute miles (16 kilometers) of the aerodrome center will be encoded as VC (in the vicinity).  Do not specify elements outside of the “vicinity” in forecasts. 1.1.2.  Forecast  elements  represent  the  expected  condition  during  the  forecast  period  and  in the  forecast  area.    Times  of  occurrence  or  changes  (as  indicated  by  YYGGGeGe  or YYGGgg) represent specific times when conditions are expected to occur. 1.2.  Code Format.  USAF bases coding practices are derived from the WMO No. 306, Volume I.1, Part A, Section FM 51, Aerodrome Forecast aligning with practices of the Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR) code also found in AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations.  Definitions and coding conventions for construction of w’w’ groups (Table 1.2) are also found in AFMAN 15-111. 1.3.  TAF Encoding. 1.3.1.  TAF Code Format.  Use the following format for encoding TAFs: Figure 1.1.

The  forecast  is  for  Barksdale  AFB,  LA  (KBAD),  issued  on  the  first  at  1555Z, valid from 011600Z to 022200Z.  The initial conditions (1600Z to 2144Z) are for winds from 030 degrees at 8 knots, visibility 800 meters in partial fog; sky cover is few (either a surface-based  partial  obscuration  or  a  layer  at  or  lower  than  50  feet),  sky  is  broken (ceiling)  at  500  feet  and  broken  at  1200  feet.    The  lowest  altimeter  setting  between 011600Z and 012144Z will be 30.01 inches of mercury.  There is a fog-induced surface-based partial obscuration from 1/8 to 2/8 coverage. 1.3.2.2.  Between  011800Z  and  012100Z,  conditions  will  vary  temporarily  (frequently but for short periods) to winds from 140 degrees at 12 knots gusting to 18 knots, visibility 3200  meters  in  light  snow  showers  and  blowing  snow,  sky  cover  is  few  at  the  surface (surface-based partial obscuration), overcast at 600 feet (the ceiling), with light rime icing from 600 to 5600 feet above ground level (AGL).  The surface based partial obscuration (FEW000) is caused by blowing snow. 1.3.2.3.  Beginning  at  012145Z,  conditions  will  change  to  wind  from  150  degrees  at  12 knots  gusting  to  20  knots;  unrestricted  visibility  9,999  meters  or  greater,  no  significant weather,  sky  cover  overcast  at  3,000  feet  and  the  minimum  altimeter  setting  from 012145Z until 012400Z will be 29.92 inches of mercury. 1.3.2.4.  Between 012300Z and 012400Z, conditions will become wind from 150 degrees at 12 knots gusting to 20 knots; visibility 3,200 meters in light snow and blowing snow, sky cover is few (either a surface-based partial obscuration or a layer at or lower than 50 feet), sky has an overcast ceiling at 400 feet.  There will be light rime icing from 400 to 6,400  feet  AGL  and  the  lowest  altimeter  setting  from  020000Z  until  022200Z  will  be 29.83  inches  of  mercury.    There  is  a  blowing  snow-induced  surface  based  partial obscuration from 1/8 to 2/8 in coverage. 1.3.2.5.  Between  020100Z  and  020300Z,  conditions  will  vary  temporarily  to  winds from130 degrees at 15 knots gusting to 25 knots, visibility 200 meters with light freezing drizzle  and  fog,  sky  totally  obscured  with  vertical  visibility  100  feet.    There  is  also moderate icing (clear) in precipitation from surface to 1,000 feet AGL and moderate icing in  cloud  (rime)  from  1,000  feet  AGL  up  to  10,000  feet  AGL.    The  forecast  maximum temperature is 00°C at 012100Z and the forecast minimum temperature is minus 01°C at 021200Z. 1.3.3.  Example Corrected (COR) TAF.  The following is an example of a corrected (COR) forecast for Ramstein AB, Germany:   8  AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013 Figure 1.3.  Corrected TAF Example.

The forecast is a correction for Ramstein  AB, Germany (ETAR), issued on the first of the month at 1615Z, valid from 011600Z to 022200Z.  Initial conditions (011600Z to 011900Z) for the forecast are winds from 280 degrees at 12 knots gusting to 25 knots, visibility 8000 meters in light rain and snow, sky cover is scattered at 600 feet, broken at 1500  feet,  and  overcast  at  2000  feet.    There  will  be  light  rime  icing  in  cloud  between 1500  and  9500  feet  AGL  and  occasional  moderate  turbulence  in  cloud  from  surface  to 9000 feet AGL.  Lowest altimeter setting from 011600Z to 011900Z will be 29.60 inches of mercury. 1.3.3.2.  Between  011800Z  and  011900Z,  the  predominant  condition  will  change gradually to winds from 270 degrees at 12 knots, visibility greater than or equal to 9,999 meters, no significant weather, sky cover scattered at 1,500 feet and broken at 2,000 feet.  The lowest altimeter setting from 011900Z to 022200Z will be 29.65 inches of mercury.  The  forecast  maximum  temperature  is  15°C  at  012000Z  and  the  forecast  minimum temperature is forecast 4°C at 021100Z. 1.3.4.  Specification of Symbolic Letters. 1.3.4.1.  Message  Heading YYG1G1/YYG2G2).  The message heading consists of: [AMD (TAF or  COR]  CCCC  YYGGggZ 1.3.4.1.1.  Message identifier of TAF 1.3.4.1.2.  Forecast modifier indicating an amendment or correction (AMD or COR).  Only one modifier will be used at a time. 1.3.4.1.2.1.  When issuing an amendment (AMD), issue only the remaining valid period  of  the  TAF  (e.g.  If  a  TAF  originally  starting  at  1600Z  is  amended  at 1847Z, only forecast groups valid at and after 1800Z are included; groups that are no longer valid are removed). 1.3.4.1.2.2.  When issuing a correction (COR), issue the entire original text of the TAF,  changing  only  the  TAF  header  and  the  erroneous  elements  (e.g.,  if  a  TAF originally  starting  at  1600Z  is  corrected  at  1615Z,  all  forecast  groups  remain included).  See Figure 1.3 for an example TAF correction. 1.3.4.1.3.  Location identifier (CCCC) 1.3.4.1.4.  Issue Date  and Time,  YYGGggZ. The issue date and time consists of the current day of the month (YY) and the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in hours (GG) and minutes (gg) followed by the letter Z.  This time is updated for each change to a TAF (i.e. a new TAF, amendments, and/or corrections). 1.3.4.1.5.  Valid  Period  (YYG1G1/YYG2G2).    The  valid  period  consists  of  the current day of the month (YY) and the 30-hour period of the forecast beginning time (G1G1)  and  ending  time  (G2G2)  in  whole  hours,  except  for  amended  TAFs.    All AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013   9  times  are  in  UTC.    For  TAF  groups  starting  and  stopping  at  midnight  UTC,  use  00 and  24,  respectively,  to  indicate  the  appropriate  valid  times.    Amended  TAFs  are valid from the current hour to the ending hour of the original TAF.  For example, if the  current  time  is  1640Z,  the  amended  time  would  be  16Z;  if  the  current  time  is 2110Z,  the  amended  time  would  be  21Z.    For  example,  amending  the  0318/0424Z TAF at 2131Z, the valid period is 0321/0424Z. 1.3.4.2.  Wind Group (dddffGfmfmKT).  Surface wind direction, speed and gusts, if any. 1.3.4.2.1.  Wind  direction  (ddd)—Forecast  true  wind  direction  (from  which  wind  is blowing)  to  the  nearest  10  degrees.    If  direction  will  vary  more  than  60  degrees, encode the prevailing direction for ddd and append the limits of variability to remarks (e.g.,  WND  270V350).    Forecast  a  prevailing  wind  direction  whenever  it  can  be determined.    In  rare  cases,  there  may  be  situations  when  forecasting  a  prevailing direction is not possible.  In these situations, encode VRB for ddd. 1.3.4.2.1.1.  When wind will be calm, encode dddff as 00000KT. 1.3.4.2.1.2.  When  wind  speed  will  be  6  knots  or  less  and  a  direction  cannot  be determined, encode dddff as VRBff. 1.3.4.2.1.3.  When wind speed will be more than 6 knots, do not use VRB for ddd unless  the  situation  involves  air-mass  thunderstorm  activity  during  which forecasting a prevailing wind direction with confidence is not possible.  When it is possible  to  forecast  the  peak  gust  direction,  but  not  the  prevailing  direction, encode  the  wind  group  as  VRBffGfmfmKT  and  append  the  probable  peak  gust direction to remarks (e.g., GST DRCTN 250). 1.3.4.2.2.  Wind Speed (ff)—Mean forecast wind speed in whole knots.  When speed is equal to or greater than 100 knots, use three digits. 1.3.4.2.3.  Gusts  (Gfmfm)—Forecast  speed  or  gusts,  in  whole  knots.    Encode  gusts when they will exceed a mean speed (ff) of 10 knots or more.  Encode gusts of 100 knots or more in three digits. 1.3.4.2.4.  KT—Unit indicator for wind speeds in knots. 1.3.4.3.  Visibility  Group  (VVVV).    Forecast  prevailing  visibility  in  meters,  rounded down  to  the  nearest  reportable  value  from  Table  1.1.    Include  weather  and/or  an obscuration  (w’w’)  whenever  visibility  is  forecast  less  than  9,999  meters.    If  visibility will alternate frequently from one significant value to another, describe the situation with a TEMPO group; do not use variable visibility remarks. NOTE: While a visibility of less than  9,999  meters  requires  a  weather  and/or  obscuration,  weather  such  as  precipitation does not require a restriction to visibility to be reported in a forecast (i.e., 9999 –RA).  In this  case,  the  weather  is  significant  because  it  is  occurring,  not  because  it  is  restricting visibility.     10  AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013 Table 1.1.

Forecast  Weather  and  Obscuration  Group  (w’w’).    AFMAN  15-111  defines forecast weather and obscurations for construction of w’w’ groups (Table 1.2). AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013   11   Table 1.2.

Construct  predominant  forecast  weather  (w’w’)  groups  by  considering Table 1.2, columns one to five in sequence.  That is intensity/proximity, followed by description, followed by precipitation type (two precipitation types can be used in the same w’w’ group), obscuration, or other weather phenomena (e.g., +SHRA is heavy showers  of  rain,  +TSRAGR  is  thunderstorms,  heavy  rain,  and  hail;  -RASN  is  light rain and snow; TS is thunderstorm without precipitation). 1.3.4.4.1.1.  Only one w’w’ group is normally included in any one forecast period unless one group will not adequately describe the forecast situation.  When more than  one  weather  or  obscuration  condition  exists,  limit  the  w’w’  group  to  three groups.    When  more  than  three  w’w’  groups  apply  to  a  situation,  select  and encode the three w’w’ that are most significant to operations. 1.3.4.4.1.2.  When  applicable,  funnel  clouds  (FC)  and  tornadoes  (+FC)  will  take precedence over all other w’w’ groups and will always be forecast as at the station and not in the vicinity. 1.3.4.4.2.1.  (DELETED) 1.3.4.4.2.2.  VC  may  be  encoded  in  combination  with  thunderstorms  (TS), showers (SH), fog (FG), blowing snow (BLSN), blowing dust (BLDU), blowing   12  AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013 sand  (BLSA),  well-developed  dust/sand  whirls  (PO),  sand  storm  (SS),  and  dust storm  (DS).    When  encoding,  place  VC  before  the  precipitation,  obscuration,  or other  weather  phenomena  entry  without  a  space  between  the  two  (i.e.,  VCSH, VCPO).    Do  not  encode  intensity  qualifiers  with  VC.    Forecast  weather  in  the vicinity will be the last entry in the weather (w’w’) group. 1.3.4.4.3.  When an encoded predominant forecast condition is followed by a change group  (BECMG  or  FM)  without  a  w’w’  group,  encode  the  change  group  w’w’  as NSW  (no  significant  weather)  to  indicate  that  significant  weather  is  no  longer expected.  This includes weather forecast in the vicinity (e.g., VCSH was included in a previous group, and forecasted to end). 1.3.4.4.4.  Forecast Volcanic Ash (VA) as present weather regardless of restrictions to visibility when VA is observed and/or the VAAC forecast includes a surfaced-based VA plume. 1.3.4.4.5.  Forecast Squall (SQ) when a strong wind characterized by a sudden onset in which the wind speed increases at least 16 knots and sustained at 22 knots or more for at least one minute. 1.3.4.5.  Cloud and Obscuration Group (NsNsNshshshsCC).  Report as often as necessary to  indicate  all  forecast  cloud  layers.    Arrange  groups  in  ascending  order  of  cloud  bases AGL (i.e., lowest base first).  Encode SKC to forecast clear skies. 1.3.4.5.1.  Cloud  Amount  (NsNsNs)—The  cloud  amount  will  be  given  as  sky  clear (SKC = no clouds); few (FEW = trace to 2/8ths); scattered (SCT = 3/8ths to 4/8ths); broken (BKN = 5/8ths to 7/8ths); or overcast (OVC = 8/8ths).  Follow the three-letter abbreviations with the height of the base of the cloud layer (mass) hshshs without a space  (i.e.,  FEW100,  SCT250).    The  summation  principle  applies.    This  principle states that the sky cover at any level is equal to the summation of the sky cover of the lowest layer, plus the additional sky cover at all successively higher layers, up to and including, the layer being considered.  Do not assign a sky cover to a layer less than a lower layer (e.g., SCT015 FEW020 should be SCT015 BKN020). 1.3.4.5.1.1.  When the sky will be totally obscured, encode VVhshshs, where VV is the indicator and hshshs is the vertical visibility in hundreds of feet. 1.3.4.5.2.  Ceiling  Height—A  ceiling  is  the  height  above  the  earth’s  surface  of  the lowest layer reported as broken or overcast; or the vertical visibility into an indefinite ceiling.  Consider all layers and obscuring phenomena to be opaque.  Therefore, there is no need to make a ceiling remark in the TAF. 1.3.4.5.3.  Indefinite  Ceiling  (VVhshshs)—The  vertical  visibility  measured  in  feet, into a surface-based total obscuration, which hides the entire celestial dome (8/8ths). 1.3.4.5.4.  Surface-Based  Partial  Obscuration—When  forecasting  a  surface-based partial  obscuration,  encode  as  FEW000,  SCT000,  or  BKN000  as  appropriate  to indicate  a  surface-based  partial  obscuration.    Code  as  a  remark  the  obscuring phenomena  and  the  applicable  layer.    For  example,  FG  SCT000  would  indicate  the w’w’ weather element causing the obscuration is caused by fog and layer amount is AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013   13  SCT.    Include  the  amount  of  partial  obscuration  in  your  sky  cover  summation computation.  Do not consider surface-based partial obscurations as a ceiling. 1.3.4.5.5.  Variable  Sky  Condition—If  two  or  more  significant  sky  conditions  will alternate  frequently  from  one  to  the  other,  describe  the  situation  with  a  TEMPO group; do not use variable sky condition remarks. 1.3.4.5.6.  Height  of  Cloud  Base  (hshshs)—Forecast  the  height  of  the  base  of  each sky cover layer in hundreds of feet AGL using the reportable layers defined in Table 1.3. Table 1.3.  Reportable Cloud Layers Range of Height Values (feet) < 50 feet > 50 feet but < 5,000 feet > 5,000 feet but < 10,000 feet > 10,000 feet Reportable Increments (feet) Round down to 000 feet To the nearest 100 feet To the nearest 500 feet To the nearest 1,000 feet 1.3.4.5.7.  Cloud Type (CC)—The only cloud type included in the aerodrome forecast is  cumulonimbus  (CB);  when  appropriate,  the  contraction  CB  follows  cloud  or obscuration height (hshsh) without a space. 1.3.4.5.7.1.  The cloud or obscuration group will include a forecast cloud type of cumulonimbus  (CB)  whenever  a  thunderstorm  is  included  in  the  significant weather  group.    This  includes  forecasts  for  thunderstorms  in  the  vicinity  (i.e., VCTS).  The following example shows the use of the CB contraction: Figure 1.4.  TAF Example Using CB Contraction.

Volcanic  Ash  (VA)  Group  (VAbbbttt).    Include  a  VA  group  in  the  TAF, following the cloud and obscuration group.  Encode all VA plume forecasts provided by the  VAAC  in  TAF  coded  products.    The  VA  plume  forecast  must  be  horizontally consistent  with  the  official  VAAC  forecast.    NOTE:    If  the  responsible  VAAC  cannot produce the volcanic ash products, then Air Force forecasts will be the primary source. 1.3.4.6.1.  VA—The volcanic ash group indicator. 1.3.4.6.2.  bbb—The  height  of  the  base  of  the  volcanic  ash,  encoded  in  hundreds  of feet AGL 1.3.4.6.3.  ttt—The height of the top of the volcanic ash layer, encoded in hundreds of feet AGL, as forecast by the VAAC. 1.3.4.6.4.  When  forecasting  VA  to  be  surface  based,  encode  VA  as  both  present weather  (w’w’)  and  add  a  VA  group.    The  following  examples  show  the  use  of  the VA group:   14  AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013 Figure 1.5.  Example of Surface-based Volcanic Ash Forecast. TAF CCCC 101555Z 1016/1122 24010KT 9999 VA FEW100 VA000200 QNH2992INS 1.3.4.6.5.  In  this  example  VA  is  surface-based  and  aloft.    The  VAAC  ash  plume forecast from the surface with a plume top of 20,000 feet. Figure 1.6.  Example of Volcanic Ash Plume Forecast. TAF CCCC 101555Z 1016/1122 24010KT 9999 FEW100 VA100200 QNH2992INS 1.3.4.6.6.  VA  is  not  surface-based  but  forecasted  in  a  VAAC  ash  plume  over  the TAF location.  The VAAC forecasted ash plume has a base height of 10,000 feet and a plume top of 20,000 feet. 1.3.4.7.  Non-Convective  Low-Level  Wind  Shear  Group  (WShxhxhx/dddfffKT).    Use this  group  only  to  forecast  wind  shear  not  associated  with  convective  activity  from  the surface  up  to  and  including  2,000  feet  AGL.    Wind  shear  is  a  potentially  hazardous problem  for  aircraft  preparing  for  approach  to,  or  take-off,  from  aerodromes.    Include forecasts of non-convective wind shear on an as-needed basis to focus the attention of the pilot on existing or expected wind shear problems. 1.3.4.7.1.  Encode  non-convective  low-level  wind  shear  forecasts  in  the  following format: 1.3.4.7.1.1.  WS—Low-level wind shear group indicator. 1.3.4.7.1.2.  hxhxhx—Forecast height of the wind shear in hundreds of feet AGL. 1.3.4.7.1.3.  ddd—Forecast  wind  direction,  in  tens  of  degrees  true,  above  the indicated  height.    Do  not  use  VRB  in  the  non-convective  low-level  wind  shear forecast group. 1.3.4.7.1.4.  ff—Forecast  wind  speed,  in  knots,  of  the  forecast  wind  above  the indicated height. 1.3.4.7.1.5.  KT—Unit indicator for wind speed in knots. 1.3.4.7.2.  Non-convective  low-level  wind  shear  forecasts  will  be  included  in  the TAF,  when  expected,  following  the  cloud  forecast  and  before  the  altimeter  setting forecast in the initial forecast period or in a FM or BECMG group.  Once included in the forecast, the wind shear group remains the prevailing condition until the next FM or  BECMG  group  or  until  the  end  of  the  forecast  valid  period  if  there  are  no subsequent  FM  or  BECMG  groups.    Forecasts  for  non-convective  low-level  wind shear will not be included in TEMPO groups. 1.3.4.7.3.  The  following  is  an  example  of  a  TAF  containing  a  non-convective  low-level wind shear forecast. AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013   15  Figure 1.7.

In  this  TAF,  non-convective  low-level  wind  shear  is  forecasted  at 1,500  feet  with  winds  from  120  degrees  at  38  knots  from  011600Z  until  the beginning of the next FM group at 012130Z. 1.3.4.8.  Icing  Group  (6IchihihitL).    Forecast  icing  group,  used  to  forecast  icing  not associated with thunderstorms (thunderstorm forecasts imply moderate or greater icing). Repeat  as  necessary  to  indicate  multiple  icing  layers.      Omit  when  no  icing  is  forecast. Format icing groups as: 1.3.4.8.1.  6—Icing group indicator. 1.3.4.8.2.  Ic—Type  of  icing  (Table  1.5)—When  forecasting  more  than  one  type  of icing within the same layer, encode the highest code figure. 1.3.4.8.3.  hihihi—Height  of  base  of  forecasted  icing  layer  in  hundreds  of  feet  AGL (Table 1.4). 1.3.4.8.4.  tL—Icing  layer  thickness  in  thousands  of  feet  (Table  1.6).    When forecasting a layer to be thicker than 9,000 feet, repeat the icing group so that the base of the layer expressed by the second group coincides with the top layer given by the first group (See Note). 1.3.4.9.  Turbulence  group  (5BhBhBhBtL).    Forecast  turbulence  group,  used  only  to forecast  turbulence  not  associated  with  a  thunderstorm  (thunderstorms  already  imply severe  or  extreme  turbulence).    Turbulence  forecasts  apply  to  category  II  (CAT  II) aircraft.  Omit when no turbulence is forecasted.  Format turbulence groups as: 1.3.4.9.1.  5—Turbulence group indicator. 1.3.4.9.2.  B—Type and intensity of turbulence (Table 1.7)—When forecasting more than one type of turbulence within the same layer, encode the highest code figure. 1.3.4.9.3.  hBhBhB—Height  of  base  of  forecasted  turbulence  layer  in  hundreds  of feet AGL (Table 1.4). 1.3.4.9.4.  tL—Thickness  of  the  turbulence  layer  in  thousands  of  feet  (Table  1.6)—When forecasting a layer to be thicker than 9,000 feet, repeat the turbulence group so that the base of the layer expressed by the second group coincides with the top layer given  by  the  first  group  (See  Note).  NOTE:    Icing  and  turbulence  forecasts  are  for phenomena  not  associated  with  thunderstorm  activity,  from  surface  to  10,000  feet AGL.    Forecasters  may  address  the  areas  above  10,000  feet  MSL  provided  the forecast  in  the  TAF  is  horizontally  consistent  with  turbulence  products  in  the  FITL graphics.    Deviations  from  the  authoritative  forecast  require  concurrence  from  the servicing OWS.   16  AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013 Table 1.4.

For  weather  and  obscurations,  use  the  alphabetic  abbreviations  in Table 1.2  Use Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Order JO 7340.2,  Contractions, for all others.  Relate operationally significant forecast elements to geographical features within the  aerodrome  radius  when  possible  and  add  start/end  times  without  adding  a  Z  when   18  AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013 applicable (e.g. FG OVR RIVER E, WND 06010KT AFT 1219, or SHRA OMTNS E 1414-1419).  Ensure start/end times are not confused with other numerical values.  Do not use the terms  OCNL,  VC,  or  CB  in  remarks.    Do  not  use  the  remarks  section  as  a  substitute  for  a BECMG or TEMPO group.  Encode remarks in the following order of entry: Maximum and Minimum Temperature 1.3.5.1.  Forecast groups (T(X)(N)[M]TFTF/YYGFGFZ).    This    group    provides    a    mechanism    to    forecast    a  two-digit    temperature    (TFTF:    whole  degrees  Celsius)  in  the  TAF  code  for  specific times.    To  indicate  forecast  maximum  and  minimum  temperatures  expected  to  occur  at the  time  indicated  by  GFGFZ,  the  letter  indicator  TX  for  the  maximum  forecast temperature and TN for the minimum forecast temperature shall precede TFTF without a space.    Organizations  encode  the  forecast  maximum  (first  entry)  and  minimum temperature  (last  entry)  for  the  first  24-hour  period  of  the  TAF.    Format  temperature groups as: 1.3.5.1.1.  TX— Maximum Temperature remark indicator 1.3.5.1.2.  TN— Minimum Temperature remark indicator 1.3.5.1.3.  TFTF—The  forecast  temperature  in  whole  degrees  Celsius  (C).    Precede temperatures  between  +9°C  and  -9°C  with  a  zero  (0);  precede  temperatures  below 0°C by the letter M (for minus). 1.3.5.1.4.  YY—The 2 digit day of the month. 1.3.5.1.5.  GFGF—The valid time to the nearest whole hour UTC of the temperature forecast. 1.3.5.1.6.  Z—Abbreviation for Zulu, the military time zone associated with UTC. Figure 1.8.  Example of Min/Max Temperature Groups TX17/0721Z  TN08/0812Z —  forecast maximum temperature is 17°C at 072100Z and forecast minimum temperature is 8°C at 081200Z.

At location where limited-duty operations are in effect (i.e. < 24-hours with no weather personnel on duty), use the following remarks with YY being the day of the month UTC and GG is the time to the nearest whole hour UTC. 1.3.5.3.1.  LAST NO AMDS AFT YYGG NEXT YYGG—Use this remark when the airfield is closed and a TAF is no longer required per coordinated requirements. AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013   19  1.3.5.3.2.  LIMITED  METWATCH  YYGG  TIL  YYGG—Use  this  remark  when  an airfield is open and no weather personnel are on duty, and an operational automated sensor is not in use. (TTTTT).   Use  BECMG  YYGG/YYGeGe,  TEMPO 1.3.6.  Change  Groups YYGG/YYGeGe,  and  FM  YYGGgg  change  groups  to  indicate  changes  from  the predominant  forecast  condition  at  some  intermediate  date  and  hour  time  (YYGGgg)  or during a specified period between hours (YYGG to YYGeGe). TEMPO groups may be used to forecast a change in any or all forecast groups and will be followed by a description of all the  elements  (except  non-convective  low-level  wind  shear  and  QNH  groups),  for  which  a change is forecast to occur intermittently from YYGG to YYGeGe. FM change groups must include all encoded elements. Start a new line of text for each change group. Change groups that begin or end at midnight UTC will use 00 and 24 respectively to indicate the appropriate valid times.  Limit change groups to those that are significant to airfield operations.  Avoid overlapping forecast  periods in  order to  avoid  confusion and keep  the intent  of the forecast simple. 1.3.6.1.  Becoming (BECMG)—The change-indicator group TTTTT YYGG/YYGeGe  in the  form  of  BECMG  YYGG/YYGeGe    will  be  used  to  indicate  a  change  to  forecast prevailing  conditions  expected  to  occur  at  either  a  regular  or  irregular  rate  at  an unspecified  time  within  the  period  defined  by  a  two-digit  date  (YY),  two-digit  change beginning  time  (GG)  with  a  solidus  separating  a  two-digit  date  (YY)  and  a  two-digit ending time (GeGe) in whole hours.  The time-period described by a BECMG group will usually  be  for  one  hour  and  never  exceed  two  hours.    This  change  to  the  predominant conditions  will  be  followed  by  a  description  of  all  elements  for  which  the  change  is forecast.  The forecast conditions encoded after the BECMG YYGG/YYGeGe group are those elements expected to prevail from the ending time of this change group (GeGe) to the  ending  time  of  the  forecast  period  (YYG2G2)  and  the  forecasted  conditions  must occur in less than 30 minutes after the YYGeGe group.  When using the BECMG group to forecast a change in one or more elements, repeat the entire element(s).  For example, if the BECMG group was used to forecast a decrease in the ceiling and all other forecast layers were expected to remain the same, the entire cloud code group must be repeated, not just the ceiling layer. 1.3.6.2.  Temporary (TEMPO)—The change-indicator group TTTTT YYGG/YYGeGe in the  form  of  TEMPO  YYGG/YYGeGe  group  will  be  used  to  indicate  temporary fluctuations  to  the  forecast  meteorological  conditions.    Conditions  described  by  the TEMPO  group  must  occur  once  during  the  specified  time-period  indicated  by  the  date YY and time GG to the date YY and time GeGe, for less than 30 consecutive minutes or occur for an aggregate total of less than 30 minutes of every cardinal hour and cover less than half of the period indicated by the date YY and time GG to  the date YY and time GeGe.  Exception: Organizations will allow 45 minutes for thunderstorms.  The extra 15 minutes provide for the 15-minute period between the time thunder is last heard and the time the thunderstorm is officially ended.  If forecast conditions in the TEMPO group last more  than  30  consecutive  minutes  or  are  expected  to  last  more  than  half  of  the  period indicated  by  the  time  YYGG  to  YYGeGe,  then  the  temporary  condition  will    be  considered    to    be    predominant    and    entered    in    the    initial    forecast    period    or following a FMYYGGgg or BECMG group.   20  AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013 1.3.6.3.  From (FMYYGGgg)—The time indicator YYGGgg in the form of FMYYGGgg will be used to indicate the beginning of a self-contained part of the forecast indicated by the two-digit date YY and four-digit time GGgg.  When the group FMYYGGgg is used, all forecast conditions preceding this group are superseded by the conditions forecasted in this group.  For example, if the TAF period is 1909/2015 and a change is forecast at 1420 UTC,  the  entry  FM191420  shall  be  encoded.    The  elements  entered  on  this  line  are  in effect from 191420 UTC to the end of the forecast period, 201500 UTC.  While the use of  a  four-digit  time  in  whole  hours  (e.g.,  1600)  remains  acceptable,  a  forecast  and amending events may require a higher time resolution.  Use forecast minutes in this case.  Four-digit resolution will only be used in this FMGGgg group.  The forecasted conditions must occur in less than 30 minutes from the time specified in the YYGGgg group. AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013   21  Chapter 2 PILOT WEATHER REPORT (PIREP) CODE 2.1.  General.  This chapter contains instructions for encoding pilot weather reports (PIREPs) in a  standard  format  to  facilitate  processing,  transmission,  storage,  and  retrieval  of  reports  of  in- flight weather occurrences.  AFMAN 15-129, Volume 2,  Air and Space Weather Operations  – Exploitation outlines procedures for requesting, recording, and disseminating PIREPs. 2.2.  PIREP Code Definitions. 2.2.1.  PIREP. encountered by an aircraft.   A  meteorological  report  specifying  atmospheric  phenomena  that  is 2.2.2.  Text  Element  Indicator  (TEI).    A  two-letter  contraction  with  solidus  used  in  the standard PIREP message to identify the elements being reported. 2.2.3.  Navigational  Aid  (NAVAID).    An  electronic  navigation  aid  facility,  specifically limited to Very High Frequency (VHF) Omni-Directional Radio Range (VOR), or combined VHF Omni-Directional Radio Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) facilities. 2.3.  Encoding PIREPS.  Place the appropriate data received from a pilot either in the air or on the ground, or from a reliable source on the ground, in a standard format for dissemination.  Each report will: 2.3.1.  Identify the type of report and each element in the report by a TEI. 2.3.2.  Include  as  a  minimum,  the  transmitting  organization,  entries  for  message  type, location, time, flight level, type of aircraft, and at least one other element. 2.3.3.  Describe location with reference to a VHF NAVAID, the four-letter airport identifier (KQ  and  EQ  identifiers  will  not  be  used),  or  under  certain  circumstances  as  identified  in paragraph 2.4.2 using latitude/longitude. 2.3.4.  Use  only  authorized  contractions  and  aircraft  designators,  listed  in  FAA  Order JO 7350.9,  Location  Identifiers,  FAA  JO  7340.2,  and  authorized  four-letter  location identifiers.  Where  plain  language  is  called  for,  authorized  contractions  and  abbreviations should  be  used.    However,  do  not  omit  essential  remarks  due  to  lack  of  readily  available contractions. 2.3.5.  Omit TEIs for unreported or unknown elements other than those in paragraph 2.3.2.  If one of the required TEIs is unknown, enter "UNKN" for that element. 2.3.6.  Correcting a PIREP.  Correct original PIREP by adding  1  minute to  the initial Time group (/TM_GGgg) and add a remark (e.g., COR 1814) when the correction is transmitted as the last entry in the REMARKS section. 2.4.  PIREP Code Breakdown.     22  AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013 Figure 2.1.

NOTE:  Each TEI is preceded by a solidus (/) and, except for flight level, followed by a space.  The underline symbol (_) is used for illustration purposes only to indicate a required space.  In the individual TEI sections that follow, the information enclosed in parentheses depict the format of optional entries.  2.4.1.  Message Type.  Identifies the type of message reported.  Use UUA for urgent or UA for routine pilot reports.  Use UUA whenever reporting any of the following: 2.4.1.1.  Tornado/waterspout (+FC) or funnel cloud (FC) 2.4.1.2.  Severe icing 2.4.1.3.  Severe or extreme turbulence, including Clear Air Turbulence (CAT) 2.4.1.4.  Widespread dust storm and sand storm 2.4.1.5.  Low-Level Wind Shear (LLWS)—This condition exists when the fluctuation in airspeed is 10 knots or more. 2.4.1.6.  Hail (GR or GS) 2.4.1.7.  Volcanic eruption and/or ash (VA) when reported by any source, in the air or on the ground. 2.4.1.8.  Any  condition  that,  in  the  judgment  of  the  person  entering  the  PIREP  into  the system, would present an extreme hazard to flight. 2.4.2.  Location (/OV).  After the TEI, describe the point at which, or the line along which, the reported phenomenon or phenomena occurred by reference to a VHF NAVAID(s), or an airport using the four-letter location identifier. Latitude/longitude may be used anywhere in the  world  and  reported  in  degrees  and  minutes  where  latitude  is  reported  in  four  digits appended with N or S (North or South) and longitude is reported in five digits appended by E or W (East or West) NOTE:  Some weather processing systems may drop the leading K, P, or  H  on  the  location  identifier  and  display  only  the  three-letter  identifier.    If  appropriate, follow the identifier by the radial bearing and distance from the NAVAID.  Using three digits each, indicate the magnetic bearing direction in degrees followed by the distance in nautical miles. 2.4.2.1.  FORMAT:    /OV_LOC/AIRPORT  or  NAVAID  (RRRDDD)  (AIRPORT  or NAVAID (RRRDDD) or /OV_LLLLN LLLLW (LATITUDE and LONGITUDE). 2.4.2.2.  LOC/AIRPORT or NAVAID is the four-letter location identifier for the airport or four-letter identifier for the VHF NAVAID.  RRR and DDD are the magnetic bearing and  distance  from  the  location,  respectively.    There  is  no  space  between  location  and RRRDDD. two is  also  no  space  before  or  after   There the  hyphen  when AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013   23  AIRPORTS/NAVAIDs are reported.  When used, latitude and longitude will be recorded using degrees and minutes North/South and East/West.  Do not use contractions such as DURC or statements such as AT TOP OF CLIMB in this field.  Add these as Remarks (/RM).    A  further  explanation  of  distance,  referencing  an  airport,  may  be  added  in remarks, such as MDW 10E.  See Table 2.1 for examples of encoding locations. Table 2.1.

Time (/TM_GGgg).  Enter the UTC time, GGgg, in hours and minutes, as given by the pilot, when the reported phenomenon was (or phenomena were) encountered or occurred.  If a  span  of  time  is  reported,  encode  the  midpoint;  for  example,  if  the  report  is  for  1845Z  to 1935Z, encode the midpoint, 1910Z as 1910. 2.4.4.  Flight  Level  (/FLHHH  (-HHH).    Enter  the  aircraft’s  altitude  (flight  level),  HHH,  in hundreds of feet above mean sea level (MSL) when the phenomenon was or phenomena were first encountered, or if the altitude is unknown, enter UNKN.  If an aircraft was climbing or descending,  enter  the  appropriate  contraction  (DURC  or  DURD)  in  the  remarks  section. Unless  stated,  all  heights  are  considered  MSL  (i.e.,  /RM  DURC  OVC005-020  AGL,  /RM DURD MOD TB 010-040 AGL).  If the condition encountered was within a layer, enter the altitude range of the layer within the appropriate phenomenon TEI or in remarks.  There is no space  between  the  FL  TEI  and  the  altitude.    NOTE:    It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Pilot  to Metro Service (PMSV) operator  to  distinguish  low-level  MSL  heights,  versus  low-level  AGL  heights,  when gathering data from the pilot. 2.4.5.  Type  of  Aircraft  (/TP_AAAA  or  /TP_UNKN).    If  the  type  of  aircraft  is  unknown, enter  UNKN;  otherwise  enter  the  aircraft  type  designator  (i.e.,  B2,  F35,  etc).    The  proper coding of this TEI is critical for the accurate interpretation and use of PIREPs, in particular those  of  icing  or  turbulence.    FAA  JO  7340.2,  Chapter  5,  provides  a  list  of  all  recognized manned  aircraft  designators  for  use  in  PIREPs.    For  aircraft  without  a  designator,  use “ZZZZ” and add clarification in the remarks section. 2.4.6.  Sky Cover (/SK).  A PIREP may include the Sky Cover TEI.  Enter the sky condition followed by heights of bases, and applicable, -TOP followed by the height of the tops.  For each  layer,  enter  the  heights  of  clouds  in  hundreds  of  feet  above  mean  sea  level  (MSL)  in three digits and use the cloud cover contractions SKC, FEW, SCT, BKN, or OVC.  If cloud   24  AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013 cover  amounts  range  between  two  values,  separate  the  contractions  with  a  hyphen  and  no spaces  (e.g.,  BKN-OVC).    Indicate  unknown  heights  by  using  UNKN.    If  the  pilot  reports he/she  is  in  clouds,  enter  OVC,  and  in  remarks  enter  IMC.    When  more  than  one  layer  is reported, separate layers by a solidus (/).  NOTE:   There are no spaces between cloud cover contractions and heights. 2.4.6.1.  FORMAT: SNsNsNs) hbhbhb, etc.   /SK_NsNsNs  (-sNsNsNs)  hbhbhb  (-TOPhththt)/NsNsNs  (-2.4.6.2.  NsNsNs is the three-letter contraction for the amount of cloud cover, hbhbhb is the height of the base of a layer of clouds in hundreds of feet, and hththt is the height of the top of the layer in hundreds of feet and indicated as TOP and the height hththt.  Thus, the code form for cloud amount, base, and tops becomes NsNsNshbhbhb-TOPhththt. Figure 2.2.

Weather  (/WX).    PIREPs  may  include  flight  visibility  and/or  flight  weather  in  this TEI. 2.4.7.1.  Flight Visibility (FV).  Flight visibility will be the first entry in the /WX TEI if reported  by  the  pilot.    Enter  it  as  FV  followed  immediately  (no  space) by  the  two-digit visibility  value  rounded  down,  if  necessary,  to  the  nearest  whole  statute  mile  (SM). Append SM to the flight visibility value (e.g., FV03SM) when reported.  Use FV99SM to enter a report of unrestricted flight visibility.  Overseas organizations using metric system visibility values will encode in kilometers.  Encode unrestricted visibility as FV99. 2.4.7.2.  When  rounding  the  visibility  value  down  becomes  operationally  significant, consider adding a clarifying comment in the Remarks section.  For example, a report of 1/2  SM  (above  airfield  minimums)  visibility  would  be  rounded  down  and  reported  as FV00SM  (below  minimums);  append  in  remarks  the  comment  IN  FLT  VIS  1/2  SM.  Leave out if unknown or not reported. 2.4.7.3.  When entering flight weather into the TEI use one or more of the listed weather types in Table 2.2, using the appropriate METAR contraction. AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013   25   Table 2.2.

When combining one or more forms of precipitation,  report the dominant type  first.    The  proximity  qualifier  VC  (vicinity)  may  be  used  in  combination  only with  the  abbreviations  TS,  FG,      SH,      PO,  BLDU,  BLSA,  and  BLSN.    Indicate intensity ( − for light, no qualifier for moderate, and + for heavy) with precipitation types, except ice crystals, snow pellets, and hail, including those  associated  with  a  thunderstorm  and  those  of  a  showery  nature.  Encode tornadoes and waterspouts as +FC.  Do not ascribe intensity to obscurations of blowing dust, blowing sand, and blowing  snow.    Only  ascribe  moderate  or  heavy  intensity  to  dust  storms  and  sand storms. 2.4.7.4.  If  reported,  enter  weather  layers  (i.e.,  fog,  haze,  smoke  or  dust)  with  the  base and/or top of the layer, encoded in the same manner as cloud cover in the /SK TEI (e.g., FU002-TOP030).    When  reporting  more  than  one  type  of  weather  phenomenon,  report the  types  in  the  following  order:  (1)  Tornado,  Funnel  Cloud,  or  Waterspout,  (2) Thunderstorm with or without associated precipitation, (3) Weather phenomena in order of decreasing predominance (i.e., the most dominant reported first).  Use separate groups for  each  type  of  weather  or  thunderstorm,  and  report  no  more  than  three  groups  in  one PIREP.  Coding present weather and the use of qualifiers/descriptors is based on Federal Meteorological  Handbook  1  (FCM-H1),  Surface  Weather  Observations  and  Reports.  Further details are in AFMAN 15-111. 2.4.7.4.1.  FORMAT:  /WX_(FVvvSM_)ww(_ww)(_ww).    The  vv  is  the  two-digit flight visibility value and ww is the variable length encoded flight weather.

Temperature (/TA).  If given the outside air temperature, encode it using two digits in whole degrees Celsius.  Prefix sub-zero temperatures with an M; for example, a temperature of –2°C is encoded /TA_M02.  If the aircrew reports an uncorrected TA, append the remark, /RM TA IS UNCORRECTED.  00°C is a positive number. 2.4.8.1.  FORMAT:    /TA_(M)T’T’.    T’T’  is  the  two-digit  temperature  value  in  whole degrees Celsius. 2.4.9.  Wind Direction and Speed (/WV).  If reported, encode the direction which the wind is blowing  from,  in  tens  of  degrees  using  three  digits.    A  0  precedes  directions  less  than  100 degrees.    For  example,  code  a  wind  direction  of  90  degrees  as  090.    Enter  the  wind  speed (spot wind) as a two- or three-digit group immediately following the wind direction.  Encode the speed in whole knots using the hundreds digit (if not zero) and the tens and units digits.  The wind group always ends with KT to indicate that winds are in knots.  Encode speeds of AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013   27  less  than  10  knots  using  a  leading  zero.    For  example,  encode  a  wind  speed  of  8  knots  as 08KT.  Encode a wind speed of 112 knots as 112KT. 2.4.9.1.  FORMAT: /WV_dddff(f)KT.  The ddd is the three-digit true direction which the wind is blowing from, in tens of degrees and ff(f) is the wind speed in knots, followed by KT. Figure 2.4.  Examples of PIREP In-Flight Wind Direction and Speed /WV 26030KT —  (Decoded: Wind 260 degrees at 30 knots) /WV 080110KT —  (Decoded: Wind 080 degrees at 110 knots) 2.4.10.  Turbulence (/TB).  When reported, enter intensity, type, and altitude of turbulence as follows: 2.4.10.1.  Intensity.  This is the first element reported after the space following the TEI.  The reportable intensities are LGT, MOD, SEV, and EXTRM.  HVY is not a reportable intensity.    Enter  a  range  or  variations  in  intensity  as  two  values  separated  by  a  hyphen (e.g., MOD-SEV).  If the pilot specifies no turbulence was encountered, enter NEG in the /TB TEI. 2.4.10.2.  Type.    May  be  blank,  or  enter  either  CAT  or  CHOP,  if  reported  by  the  pilot.  CAT  is  Clear  Air  Turbulence.    Encountering  this  type  of  turbulence  occurs  where  no clouds are present and commonly applied to high-level turbulence associated with wind shear,  often  near  the  jet  stream.    CAT  intensity  may  be  light,  moderate,  severe,  or extreme.    CHOP  turbulence  causes  rapid  and  somewhat  rhythmic  jolts  or  bumpiness without appreciable changes in altitude or attitude and may be indicated as either light or moderate.  Never report CHOP as severe or extreme. 2.4.10.3.  Altitude.  Enter the reported turbulence altitude only if it differs from the value reported in /FL, or when reported as a layer with defined or undefined boundaries.  When entering a layer, use a hyphen between height values.  Enter undefined lower and higher boundary  limits  as  BLO  or  ABV.    Use  a  solidus  to  separate  two  or  more  layers  of turbulence. 2.4.10.4.  FORMAT:  /TB_III (-III)(_CAT or CHOP_)_(hbhbhb-hththt)/III(-III) etc.  The III is the intensity of the turbulence and CAT or CHOP are the only two entries for type of turbulence permitted.  The hbhbhb group is the base of the turbulence layer, if defined, or BLO or ABV, if undefined; and hththt is the top of a defined layer or the boundary of an undefined layer. Figure 2.5.  Example of PIREP Turbulence /TB_EXTRM_350 /TB_MOD-SEV_BLO_080 /TB_LGT_035 /TB_LGT-MOD_CHOP_310-350 /TB_NEG /TB_ NEG_220-280/MOD_CAT_ABV 2.4.11.  Icing  (/IC).    Enter  reports  of  icing  using  the  same  format  to  report  turbulence  (i.e., intensity, type, and altitude(s) of icing conditions).   28  AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013 2.4.11.1.  Intensity.    Enter  TRACE,  LGT,  MOD,  SEV,  or  ranges  covering  two  values separated by a hyphen.  HVY is not a reportable intensity.  If the pilot specifies no icing was encountered, enter NEG in the /IC TEI. 2.4.11.2.  Type.  Enter the reported icing types: RIME, CLR (Clear), or MXD (Mixed). 2.4.11.2.1.  RIME — Rough, milky, opaque ice formed by the instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets. 2.4.11.2.2.  CLR (Clear) — Glossy, clear, or translucent ice formed by the relatively slow freezing of large supercooled water droplets. 2.4.11.2.3.  MXD (Mixed) — A combination of rime and clear icing. 2.4.11.3.  Altitude.    Enter  the  reported  icing  altitude  only  if  it  differs  from  the  value reported  in  /FL,  or  is  reported  as  a  layer  with  defined  or  undefined  boundaries.    When entering a layer, use a hyphen between height values.  Enter undefined lower and higher boundary limits as BLO or ABV.  Use a solidus ("/") to separate two or more layers of icing. 2.4.11.4.  FORMAT.    /IC_III  (-III)  _  (type)  _  (hbhbhb-hththt)/III  (-III)  _etc.    The  III  is the intensity of the icing; type is one of the three listed icing types; hbhbhb is the base of the icing layer, if defined, or BLO or ABV, if undefined; and hththt is the top of a defined layer or the boundary of an undefined layer.

Data or phenomena  following this TEI are considered significant; however, they do not fit in any previously reported TEI or they further define entries reported in other TEIs.  Enter correction remarks as the last entry.  Report the following phenomena when encountered by pilots.  Enter heights only if they differ from /FL. 2.4.12.1.  Wind  Shear.    Low-Level  Wind  Shear  (LLWS)  is  indicated  by  rapid  air  speed fluctuations  within  2,000  feet  of  the  earth’s  surface.    When  the  fluctuation  in  airspeed is10 knots or more, the report is classified as an urgent (UUA) PIREP.  When LLWS is a reason  for  issuing  an  Urgent  PIREP,  or  whenever  it  is  included  as  an  element  in  any PIREP,  enter  LLWS  as  the  first  remark  immediately  after  the  /RM  TEI,  (i.e.,  /RM LLWS_-15KT_SFC-003_DURC_RY22_JFK.    LLWS  may  be  reported  as  -,  +,  or  +/-, depending  on the effect of the phenomena  on the aircraft.  If the location of the LLWS encounter is different from the /OV or /FL TEI, then include this information in remarks using the same format(s). 2.4.12.2.  FUNNEL  CLOUD,  TORNADO,  and  WATERSPOUT.    Enter  the  appropriate term followed by the direction of movement, if reported. 2.4.12.3.  Thunderstorm.  Enter area coverage descriptions (ISOLD, FEW, SCT, NMRS), or if storms are reported in a line, enter description (LN, SCT LN, BKN LN, SLD LN), if AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013   29  known.    Follow  the  area  coverage  description  with  the contraction  TS,  the  location and movement of storms, and type of lightning, if known. 2.4.12.4.  Lightning.  Enter frequency (OCNL, FRQ, CONS), followed by lightning type (e.g.,  OCNL  LTGIC,  FRQ  LTGCCCA,  CONS  LTGICCG,  FRQ  LTGCA)  or combinations, as reported by the pilot. 2.4.12.5.  Electric Discharge.  Enter DISCHARGE followed by altitude if different from flight level. 2.4.12.6.  Contrails.  Enter CONTRAILS followed by their height if different from the/FL height. 2.4.12.7.  Cloud Reports.  Report heights of bases and tops encountered in /SK TEI.  The remarks  section  is  used  for  clouds  that  can  be  seen  but  were  not  encountered  during flight, such as CS W, OVC BLO, SCT-BKN ABV, TS E MOV NE, etc. 2.4.12.8.  Language/Terminology.  The pilot may report information in words or phrases that  are non-standard  or cannot be encoded, such as  very rough or  bumpy.  If specified phraseology is not adequate, use plain language to enter a description of the phenomena as clearly and concisely as possible.  Appropriate remarks made by the pilot that do not fit in any TEI may also be included in remarks section.  Some remarks that fall into this category are DURC, DURD, RCA, TOP, TOC, or CONTRAILS. 2.4.12.9.  Volcanic  Eruption.    Indicate  Volcanic  Eruption  in  the  remarks  section  of  an Urgent PIREP.  (Volcanic ash alone is considered weather phenomena and is included in /WX TEI.)  In a report of volcanic activity, include as much information as possible, such as  the  name  of  the  volcano/mountain,  time  of  observed  eruption  (if  different  from  /TM entry),  location,  and  any  ash  cloud  observed  with  the  direction  of  the  ash  cloud movement.  When receiving a report from anyone other than a pilot in the air or on the ground enter aircraft UNKN, flight level UNKN, and indicate in Remarks that the report is  UNOFFICIAL.    If  the  report  is  only  for  the  smell  of  Sulfur  Dioxide  (SO2),  and  no volcanic ash, enter VA into the WX section of the PIREP and place in remarks “SO2 NO ASH” or “SULFUR SMELL NO ASH”.  Treat reports for SO2 and no ash cloud as non-urgent PIREPs. 2.4.12.10.  PIREP Source.  For further identification of the source of a PIREP, append the aircraft identification, call sign, or registration number to the Remarks section. 2.4.12.10.1.  The  facility  encoding  the  PIREP  may  be  added  to  the  end  of  the remarks (e.g., ZLA CWSU). 2.4.12.11.  Remotely  Piloted  Aircraft  (RPA)  /  Unmanned  Aerial  Systems  (UAS)  PIREPS.    Except  for  unmanned  aircraft  equipped  with  specialized  meteorological sensors,  RPA  /  UAS  pilots  typically  rely  on  the  limited  capability  of  onboard  Day  TV (DTV)/Infrared (IR) sensors and ground control station (GCS) readouts to detect inflight weather.  As a result, observed weather conditions filtered through the “lenses” of RPA / UAS  sensors  may  differ  significantly  from  weather  conditions  observed  by  pilots  of manned aircraft.  To ensure accurate interpretation of weather reported by RPA pilots: 2.4.12.11.1.  Only  encode  objective  weather  elements  (i.e.,  temperature  and  wind speed/direction) in the main portion of the text element report.   30  AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013 2.4.12.11.2.  Encode subjective weather elements (i.e., sky cover, weather, flight level visibility,  turbulence,  and  icing)  observed  using  onboard  sensors  in  the  remarks section of the report. 2.4.12.11.3.  Precede  subjective  weather  elements  encoded  in  the  remarks  section of the report with an estimated remark followed by the type of sensor used to determine subjective weather condition(s) (e.g., “EST DTV” for Day TV, “EST IR” for Infrared (IR) sensor, or “EST GCS”). 2.5.  PIREP Examples: 2.5.1.  Clear-air  Turbulence.    At  2200Z,  a  Boeing  757-200  pilot  reports  severe  clear-air turbulence between 35,000 and 39,000 feet over Toledo. Figure 2.7.  Example of Clear-Air Turbulence in a PIREP CCCC UUA /OV_KTOL/TM_2200/FLUNKN/TP_B752/TB_SEV_CAT_350-390 2.5.2.  Dust storms or Sand storms.  At 0750Z, a pilot reports a dust storm 35 miles northeast of Midland, Texas, flying at 4,000 feet with a visibility of 3/4 of a mile. Figure 2.8.  Example of Dust Storm in a PIREP CCCC UUA /OV_KMAF045035/TM_0750/FL040/TP_UNKN/WX_FV00SM_DS/RM IN FLT VIS 3/4SM 2.5.3.  Electric  Discharge.    A  military  pilot  flying  an  F-22  Raptor  between  Richmond, Virginia, and  Washington,  D.C., reports at 2120Z that  the aircraft experienced an electrical discharge 20 miles south of Washington at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

Repeat lines 4 and 4aas often as necessary.  Include data for only one phenomenon on a single data line 4 or 4a. 2.  For filaments which disappear overnight: Report the last time the filament was observed as the DSF start time, with a time qualifier of s = 3, "Activity started after GGgg"; and the time the filament was first observed to be absent as the DSF end time, with a time qualifier of e = 2, "Activity ended before GGgg".  Coordination with other observatories to narrow this time period is permitted.  Report the location of the DSF as its position at the time the filament was last visible.  As with all other DALAS messages, the date of the message (DD) must correspond to the activity start time. Do not use the DALAS code to report overnight DSF if the period between activity start and end exceeds 24 hours.  Instead, report all relevant information about the DSF in a scheduled or unscheduled PLAIN language message. 3.  Report DALAS features equal to or less than 5 degrees in length with only one QXXYY group located by the centroid.  Use up to three QXXYY groups, as needed, to indicate the two end points and one intermediate point.  If more than three QXXYY groups are required to describe a filament, either report the additional groups in an appended plain language message or divide the filament into sections and report them in separate DALAS messages. 3.4.

Do not include data for more than one GMT day in a single message.  Repeat line 4 as often as necessary. Include data for only one frequency on a single data line. 2.  The pp indicator in line 3 is a safeguard should any of the p values be garbled in lines 4. Repeat the highest p value assigned to any of the peak fluxes of the FFabp groups as pp in line 3. For example, if highest p value equals 2, then pp is encoded as 22. 3.  If a preliminary event-level burst is transmitted in error (e.g., caused by RFI, not occurring, or not event-level), immediately transmit a deletion using the event header (SXXX_ _, where _ _ is the specific numeric designator for each site) and the deletion code 4, and attach a short PLAIN message stating the event was transmitted in error. 4.  This only applies to uncertainty in hours and full minutes.  It does not apply to uncertainty in tenth of minutes. 5.  JJ is the same number for each frequency reported that, in the analyst's judgment, gives burst information associated with the same event.  Noise storms on different frequencies will have separate serial numbers assigned, to facilitate ending the noise storms independently. 6.  If a distinctly separate burst is superimposed on a non-impulsive burst, a noise storm, or on the decaying stage of a large burst, treat it as a separate burst and assign a different burst serial number. 7.  If, for example, the first two significant figures of a flux reading are 52, then a = 5 and b = 2. If the actual reading is 52 solar flux units (sfu) (1 sfu = 10-22 watt*m^-2*Hz^-1), then p = 1 and abp =521 (for 5.2 x 101).  Similarly, if the actual reading is 5200 sfu, then p = 3, and abp = 523 (for 5.2 x 103).  Do not report mean flux for noise storms or fluctuations, instead encode "000". Mean flux estimates for other types of bursts are required, even during manual operations. 8.  When a Castelli-U event occurs, continue to report the maximum peaks for each frequency, rather than the peaks used in defining the Castelli-U. 9.  Do not report bursts of less than 100 sfu unless they are significant and/or contribute to the understanding of what is occurring.  Examples: Gradual Rise and Fall bursts, or bursts that are part of a spectral group, should be reported even when their peaks are less than 100 sfu. 10.  The standard unit of integrated flux is the solar flux unit-second, where 1 sfu-sec equals 10- 22 watt*sec*m-2*Hz-1 or 10-22 joule*m-2*Hz-1.  Encode an integrated flux of 564,000 sfu-sec as 75605 (or 95605), which equals 5.6 x 10-17 watt*sec*m-2*Hz-1.  Do not report integrated fluxes for noise storms or fluctuations; reporting these fluxes are optional for other types of bursts during manual operations, since they can be computed later from the time and mean flux data in the message.  If an integrated flux value is not reported, replace the abpp with ////.  4.2.  Spectral Solar Radio Burst Code (SWEEP).

For messages sent at 15-minute periods of transmission, report only one 15-minute data set.  For messages transmitted every 30 minutes, report only two 15-minute data sets (observation intervals).  Messages transmitted once per hour would contain four 15-minute data sets. 2.  Use lines 5 through 7 only when needed to report data from a constellation of 2, 3, or 4 satellites within the field of view of the IMS during the reporting period of the messages. 3.  Repeat lines 4 through 7 for each data set corresponding to a time interval within the message.  For example, a message transmitted once per hour containing four 15-minute data sets and 4 satellites within the field of view for the entire period would have 3 lines for each 15- minute period for satellite 1 (Lines 4, 4a, 4b), 3 lines for each 15-minute period for satellite 2 (Lines 5, 5a, 5b), etc.  Thus, 3 lines per satellite per period, for 4 satellites, for 4 periods, would equate to 48 lines. 4.  The Ionospheric Penetration Point (IPP) is defined to be where the ray path between the GPS/NAVSTAR satellite and the IMS intersects 350 km altitude (typically in the F-region). 5.  Express latitudes and longitudes to the nearest tenth of a degree.  Longitudes run from 0 to 359.9 degrees west of Greenwich.  Latitudes run from -90.0 to +90.0, the sign being distinguished by the first coded character (0=positive, 1=negative).  Examples: 0675 is 67.5N; while 1675 is 67.5S. 6.  If the standard deviation (ddd) is lower by a factor of 10 from the TEC, encode ddd as 0dd (which is two significant digits to nearest tenth) in order to raise the exponent by one.  For example, if TEC equals 25.2 x 1016 and the standard deviation is 31.1 x 1015, then tttddde is 2520316.  If ddd is out of range (too low or high), encode as //9 or //0 respectively. 7.  If the minimum (tytyty) TEC is lower by a factor of 10 from the maximum TEC, encode tytyty as 0tyty (which is two significant digits to nearest tenth) in order to raise the exponent by one.  For example, if TEC (maximum) equals 35.2 x 1016 and TEC (minimum) is 98.1 x 1015, encode txtxtxtytytye as 3520986.  If TEC (minimum) is two orders of magnitude lower, encode as 00ty to raise exponent by two; i.e., 98.1 x 1014 is reported as 009.  If TEC minimum is out of range, encode as //9. 8.  Locations of the mean Amplitude Scintillation Index (S4) and mean Phase Scintillation Index (sigma-sub-delta-phi) are assumed to be at the same location (IPP) as the mean TEC (tttddde) group in Line 4. 9. The maximum S4 measured at 1.6 GHz should be in approximately the same location as the maximum S4 at 1.2 GHz. 10. The maximum spectral strength (TxTxTx) and the minimum slope parameter (PnPnPn) derived from the differential carrier phase advances between the two satellite frequencies (1.6 GHz and 1.2 GHz) are considered the worst cases for the occurrence of phase scintillation.  AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013   67  Chapter 6 SPECIAL CODES 6.1.  Event Code (EVENT).  Use this code for rapid reporting of real-time solar and geophysical events.    The  activity  being  reported  has  a  unique  identifier  depending  on  the  type  of  data. NOTE: the EVENT code (not to be confused with an encoded message such as BURST that is event-level)  is  transmitted  when  responding  to  a  REQST  from  the  SpaceWOC.    Send  an  event code  (EVENT)  response  to  all  instrument  observatories  when  your  observations  do  not  meet event criteria reported by another site.  For example,  if Sagamore  Hill transmits an event-level burst of 4000sfu on 245 MHz, and your 245 MHz burst at Kaena Point has reached a maximum of only  120sfu, then you would transmit a RADNS.  If you are not on the sun, respond with  a RADNO.  These same guidelines apply to optical (SOON) responses.  RSTN and SOON sites on the  sun  should  respond  only  once  with  the  appropriate  activity  condition.    The  purpose  of  the EVENT  Code  is  the  rapid  exchange  of  brief  event  information  (or  lack  of  it).    The  valuable information needed at the forecast centers is the coded preliminary burst, sweep, flare or DALAS messages.  EVENT coded data should  not be sent when the actual messages are available, and repeated EVENT Code transmissions should be minimized. Figure 6.1.

RAD (II), SWP(II), FLA(II), LOOP(I), and LIMB(I) may be encoded in any order within a single EVENT code message.  Repeat these event-type indicator groups in a message to report multiple phenomena (e.g., RAD05 RADCU).  No more than eight groups may be included in a single message. 2.  Do not report a combination of RAD05, RAD11, or RAD55 in the same message.  Report RAD00 and RADCU regardless of whether RAD05, RAD11, or RAD55 have already been reported.  Report RAD00 and RADCU only once per burst. 3.  SWP (II) data are not immediately available.  Transmit reports as soon as an accurate determination of sweep type is made. 4.  To initially report a flare event, an optical-only observatory in automatic mode (computer is able to analyze data and generate messages) will transmit a preliminary FLARE code message in place of the EVENT code "FLA//" message.  Combined optical-radio observatories are not required to (but may) include a "FLA//" in an all-sensor EVENT code message under these circumstances.  Since there is only one flare event threshold (i.e., exceeding 0N), do not transmit another "FLA//" message when a flare increases classification (for example, when it goes from a 1N to a 1B or a 2B).  However, an extra FLARE code preliminary message, before the mandatory post maximum preliminary, would be appropriate. 5.  Omit the LOOP(I) and/or LIMB(I) group(s) if they do not apply.  Report LOOP(I) and LIMB(I) only once per event. If a loop prominence event or an energetic limb event is still in progress when a new all-sensor EVENT code message must be transmitted for any reason, the solar analyst may (depending on the exact circumstances) find it appropriate to append a Plain Language Code (PLAIN) (see paragraph 6.3) stating that loops or limb event activity is still in progress. 6.  X-ray event messages do not require a response from the observatories.  6.2.  Event  Acknowledgment  Code  (AKNOW).

Do not combine optical, radio, and geophysical instruments in a single STATS message.  Send each system status in separate messages, using the MANOP headers appropriate to the data type: AXXX61 for optical, AXXX71 for radio, and SXXX6_ for ionospheric.  If old STATS messages are transmitted (e.g., to update 2d Weather Squadron, the current status must be retransmitted after sending the old messages is completed, since it is the last received message that updates the forecast center status displays.  2.  Repeat lines 4 and 4a as often as necessary, but do not include data for more than one UTC day in a single message.  Data line 4 contains the 11111 and GGggM groups, and a maximum of 7 jEEOI groups. Data line 4a contains the 22222 group and a maximum of 8 jEEOI groups.  3.  At a SOON site the method of observation ("M") may change (from semiautomatic to automatic, or vice versa) without any system/equipment item changing status.  This may occur when light levels improve in the morning, making automatic operations possible, and again later in the evening when declining light levels may make automatic operations impossible.  In such situations, the analyst must send a STATS message with a single jEEOI group of 206// (the 206// group is required for decode purposes at the forecast center, not because the status of the Hydrogen-alpha system (EE = 06) has changed).  For example, a SOON site opened in semi-automatic mode; when light levels improve sufficiently to support automatic operations, the analyst would transmit the following message, even though no systems/equipment changed status. Figure 6.5.  Example of STATS Message to change status from Semiautomatic to Automatic STATS IIiii 20226 20101 11111 17401 206// 99999  4.  Report the status of all installed systems/equipment, in numerical order (i.e., // or 01, 02, 03, ...), in the first STATS message of the observing day.  For SOON, analysts may report 05 (FMQ- 7, all SOON subsystems) in place of 06 to 09 if these items have the same status, expected outage time, and reason for outage.  For RSTN, analysts may report 10 (FRR-95, all discrete frequency radiometers and SRS) in place of 11 to 88 and 19 if these items have the same status, expected outage time, and reason for outage.  For example, a SOON site opens with the computer, commercial phones, and spectrograph inoperative; site has no Defense Switching Network (DSN) capability installed:  Figure 6.6.

The above example could be coded: AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013   77  Figure 6.7.  Example of STATS Message for Equipment Outage STATS IIiii 20226 20101 11111 17252 0//// 10192 10442 10752 99999  5.  After the first STATS message of the observing day, it is only necessary to report the systems/equipment that change status during the day.  For example, continuing from the example above, computer repaired, but no other changes:  Figure 6.8.  Example of STATS Message for Equipment Status Change. STATS  IIiii 20226 20101  11111 18301 201// 99999  STATS reportable internet network, DSN, or commercial phone outage is intended to reflect a site-wide outage in send, receive, or both.  The fact that a single phone instrument/line or teletype printer is out of service is not reportable by STATS.  For example, at a dual SOON/RSTN site, if SOON has no internet network capability, but RSTN does, the outage is not reportable by STATS.  At a dual site, the SOON and RSTN analysts should not both report a site-wide internet network, DSN, or commercial phone outage.  In fact, for a dual site, use only a SOON STATS message (i.e., 11111 or 22222 line entry) to update these three items.  The same is not true for computers.  It is possible for one side to have a computer outage and the other side to be in automatic mode, so the SOON and RSTN computers are treated separately.  For this reason, a computer outage that affects both SOON and RSTN must be reported in both a SOON and a RSTN STATS message.   Repeat lines 5 and 5a as often as necessary, but do not include data for more than one UTC day in a single message.  Data line 5 contains the 33333 and GGggM groups, and a maximum of seven jFFOI groups.  Data line 5a contains the 44444 group and a maximum of eight jFFOI groups.   Repeat lines 6 and 6a as often as necessary, but do not include data for more than one UTC day in a single message.  For example, report status of an ionosonde and an IMS in the same STATS message using two lines 6.  Data line 6 contains the 55555 and GGggM groups, and a maximum of seven jHHOI groups.  Data line 6a contains the 66666 group and a maximum of eight jHHOI groups.   78  AFMAN15-124  28 FEBRUARY 2013 Chapter 7 OTHER CODES 7.1.  Target  Weather  Information  Reporting  Code  (TARWI).
