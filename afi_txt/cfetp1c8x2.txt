The changing Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) and Air and Space Expeditionary Forces (AEF) environments require vision, preparation, and attention to ensure people have the right skills and tools to deliver the C4I capabilities and the support required by the war fighter in meeting the Air Force mission of today and the vision of the future.  Declining resources, expanding diversity of mission, and ever-changing technologies in the Air Force are impacting the availability of our most valuable resource--people.  These factors will continue to exist in the future, making it essential for the work force to be effectively and efficiently trained to perform duties within each skill level of an Air Force Specialty (AFS).  To meet the challenges of tomorrow, the Air Force must place a greater emphasis on career field training.  This Airfield Systems Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive core training document that identifies life-cycle training/education requirements, support resources, and minimum core task requirements for the 1C8X2 specialty.  The plan is a "training road map" for the career field.  It provides personnel a clear career path to success and makes career field training identifiable, measurable, and budget defensible. 2.  This CFETP is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty.  The CFETP documents the career field training program and consists of two parts.  Management uses both parts in conjunction with the Training Business Area (TBA) to plan, manage, and control training within the career field. NOTE:  Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training. 2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training, and other); and Section D indicates resource constraints. Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, facilities; Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt. 2.2.  Part II includes the following:  Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, Training References (TRs) to support training, AETC conducted training, wartime course and core tasks, and correspondence course requirements.  Section B contains the Course Objectives List (COL) and training standards supervisors will use to determine if airmen satisfied training requirements.  Section C identifies available support materials.  An example is a Qualification Training Package, which may be developed to support proficiency training.  Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses.  Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.  At unit level,  4  supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. 3.  Use of the guidance provided in this CFETP provides the foundation for effective and efficient training for individuals in this career field at the appropriate points in their careers.   This plan enables the Air Force to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs. 5  Abbreviations/Terms Explained This section provides a common understanding of the terms that apply to the Airfield Systems Career Field and Education Training Plan.

The mission of GCSS-AF is to provide timely, accurate, and trusted Agile Combat Support (ACS) information to Joint and Air Force commanders, their staffs, and ACS personnel at all ranks and echelons, with the appropriate level of security needed to execute the Air Force mission throughout the spectrum of military operations.  GCSS-AF is the means by which ACS functional systems will be modernized and integrated to improve business processes supported on a single robust network-centric infrastructure.  In addition to integrating combat support applications, GCSS-AF also provides core enterprise services such as a common user presentation through the AF Portal, Enterprise Information Management (Workflow, Records Management, Document Management, Knowledge Management, and Collaboration), and an enterprise data warehouse. Global Command and Control System (GCCS).  An automated information system designed to support deliberate and crisis planning with the use of an integrated set of analytic tools and flexible data transfer capabilities.  GCCS will become the single C4I system to support the warfighter from foxhole to command post. Go/No-Go.  The “Go” is the stage at which a trainee has gained enough skill, knowledge, and experience to perform the tasks without supervision; meets the task standard.  “No-Go” is the stage at which the trainee has not gained enough skill, knowledge, and experience to perform task without supervision; does not meet task standard. Individual Training Plan (ITP).  Use AF Form 623, On-the-Job Training Record/AF Form 623B, or other approved records system (e.g., Training Business Area (TBA)).

In response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will be taught in the 3-level course in a streamlined training environment.  These tasks are only for those career fields that still need them applied to their schoolhouse tasks.  11  Workflow.  A series of steps necessary for the initiation, tracking, and delivery of services or outputs with the capability to cut across existing or future organizational boundaries.  Furthermore, web-based workflow products allow electronic coordination, staffing, and task management of documents and files.  They are relational to an electronic version of the Staff Summary Sheet (SSS) and other AF/DoD forms used for routing/collection of information.  Automation provides the capability to suspense and track correspondence through the workflow process and provides action officers and document originators status on their packages.  Provides users the capabilities to comply with structured electronic workflow processes and the flexibility to create/develop ad hoc workflow courses of actions.  Future use of standardized EIM tools will enhance usability and eliminate legacy methods.   12  Section A - General Information 1.  Purpose of the CFETP.  This CFETP provides the information necessary for AFCFMs, MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training those individuals in AFSC 1C8X2 should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their careers.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the AF or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  This training is provided by the 338th Training Squadron (TRS) at Keesler AFB, MS.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, Career Development Course (CDC) completion, and correspondence courses required for award of the 5-, 7-, or 9-skill level.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes, some of which are: 1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field-training program.  Also, ensures that established training is provided at the appropriate point in an individual's career. 1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career. 1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training and the training medium. 1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact implementation of the desired career field training program. 2.  Use of the CFETP.  The CFETP is maintained by the 1C8XX Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), AF A3O-B.  MAJCOM FMs and AETC review the plan annually to ensure currency and accuracy and forward recommended changes to the AFCFM.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they determine whether duplicate training exists and take steps to eliminate/prevent duplicate efforts.  Career field training managers at all levels use the plan to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive training program is available for each individual in the career ladder. 2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, nonresident, field, and exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  MAJCOM FMs ensure their training programs complement the CFETP for mandatory initial skill and upgrade requirements.  They also identify the needed AFJQSs/AFQTPs to document unique upgrade and continuation training requirements.  Requirements are satisfied through OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courseware/courses.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be included in this plan.  13  2.3.  81 TRSS/TSQ Qualification Training Flight (Q-Flight) personnel develop training packages (AFJQSs/AFQTPs) based on requests submitted by the MAJCOMs and according to the priorities assigned by the AFCFM. 2.4.  Unit level training managers and supervisors manage and control progression through the career field by ensuring individuals complete the mandatory training requirements for upgrade specified in this plan and supplemented by their MAJCOM.  The list of courses in Part II is used as a reference for planning continuation or career enhancement training. 2.5.  Submit recommended CFETP corrections to the 81 TRSS Q-Flight Customer Service Desk at 81 TRSS/TSQS, 601 D Street, Keesler AFB MS 39534-2235 or call DSN 597-3343.  To contact electronically send email to: qflight.customer.service@us.af.mil. 2.6.  Submit recommended CFETP additions/deletions through your MAJCOM Functional Manager. 3.  Coordination and Approval of the CFETP.  The AFCFM is the approval authority.  MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The AETC training manager initiates an annual review of this document by AETC and MAJCOM functional managers to ensure the CFETP’s currency and accuracy by using the list of courses in Part II to eliminate duplicate training.   14  Section B - Career Field Progression and Information 4.

Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to superintendent skill levels play an important role in the Air Force's ability to accomplish its mission.  It is essential that everyone involved in training do their part to plan, manage and conduct an effective training program.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP and the 1C8X2 Education and Training Path table will ensure individuals receive viable training at appropriate points in their careers.   6.  Training Decisions.  This CFETP was developed to encapsulate an entire spectrum of training requirements for the Airfield Systems career field, using a building block approach (simple to complex).  Included in this spectrum is the strategy of when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training. 6.1.  Proficiency Training.  This training is job qualification for an assigned duty position.  Additional qualification training becomes necessary when personnel transfer to another duty position, the unit mission changes, a new personnel program comes on board, or any time changes in techniques or procedures occur. 6.1.1.  The 81 TRSS/TSQ (Q-Flight) develops AFJQSs/AFQTPs to support tasks relating to communications-electronics and communications-computer systems, functions and duties.   18  Completion of AFJQSs/AFQTPs is mandatory by duty position for personnel in upgrade or qualification training. 6.1.2.  CDC development is restricted to 3 volumes, two hundred pages each.  The first volumes will be common to all 1C8XX AFSCs, followed by the respective AFSC-specific volumes. The following table outlines 5-level CDC contents. VOLUME 1 VOLUME 2 VOLUME 3 0B1C852 Duties, Test Equipment, Transmit and Receive Fundamentals, Airfield Systems Configuration/Layout Air Traffic Control Navigation Systems Meteorological, Radio Communication/Recorder, Tactical Airfield, and Special Systems 6.2.  No CDC or 7-level course currently exists for upgrade to 7-level. 6.3.  No 9-Level training requirements currently exist.  6.4.  Commercial Certifications.  Below are some available commercial certifications for 1C8X2 technicians.  An “X” in the DANTES column indicates that testing may be completed at the base education office.  Tuition Assistance (TA) pays for only one certification during an entire career. See the local base education office for more information.

FIELD, Lieutenant General, USAF DCS, Operations, Plans & Requirements OFFICIAL   Attachments: 1.  IT Fundamentals Course Training Standard (CTS) 2.  Specialty Training Standard (STS) 1C8X2   31  PREFACE NOTE 1:  Dashed items in this CTS are not part of the original CTS created at the March 2009 IT Fundamentals conference however, they are the specific objectives taught in the IT Fundamentals course designed to meet the CTS requirements. NOTE 2:  Unless otherwise stated, students may be allowed two assists from the instructor and still successfully achieve the proper level of proficiency.  An instructor assist is anytime an instructor must intercede to provide guidance to a student which leads to a satisfactory completion of the objective or to prevent the student from continuing in a manner that will lead to an unsatisfactory conclusion, safety violation, or damage to equipment. NOTE 3:  All 3-level tasks will be trained if a wartime surge is ordered. Proficiency Code Key  Scale Value  Task Performance Levels  *Task Knowledge Levels  **Subject Knowledge Levels  1 2 3 4 a b c d A B C D Definition: The individual  Can do simple parts of the task. Needs to be told or shown how to do most of the task. (EXTREMELY LIMITED)  Can do most parts of the task. Needs only help on hardest parts. (PARTIALLY PROFICIENT)  Can do all parts of the task. Needs only a spot check of completed work. (COMPETENT)  Can do the complete task quickly and accurately. Can tell or show others how to do the task. (HIGHLY PROFICIENT)  Can name parts, tools, and simple facts about the task. (NOMENCLATURE)  Can determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task. (PROCEDURES)  Can identify why and when the task must be done and why each step is needed. (OPERATING PRINCIPLES)  Can predict, isolate, and resolve problems about the task. (ADVANCED THEORY)  Can identify basic facts and terms about the subject. (FACTS)  Can identify relationship of basic facts and state general principles about the subject. (PRINCIPLES)  Can analyze facts and principles and draw conclusions about the subject. (ANALYSIS)  Can evaluate conditions and make proper decisions about the subject. (EVALUATION)  Explanations *  A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.  (Example: b and 1b) **  A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks.  This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC. X  This mark is used alone in course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources. NOTE:  All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime.  32  1.  ELECTRONICS SUPPORT SUBJECTS 1.1.  Safety 1.2.  First Aid 1.3.

AFJQS items set the standard for qualification and certification and are mandatory for use in conjunction with this STS when applicable to the duty position. NOTE 3:  All objectives are trained during wartime. NOTE 4:  Track and manage training for TSgts and below and MSgt/SMSgt retrainees using Training Business Area (TBA). NOTE 5:  When an AFJQS is loaded into TBA, AFJQS task numbering will vary from the STS.  The numbering scheme is defined by your work center specific master training plan. NOTE 6:  Third person certification is not required for Airfield Systems personnel. NOTE 7:  Initial skills course climbing training objectives will be satisfied using a 40’ tower. NOTE 8:  Initial skills course objectives will be satisfied using the local maintenance computer. NOTE 9:  Senior NCO’s in the 1C8XX AFSCs are not required to have an Individual Training Plan (ITP) with the following exceptions:  personnel in upgrade training status or performing equipment maintenance as part of primary duties.  Unit Commanders can require MSgt's with UTC tasks to have an ITP.   37 Attachment 2 STS 1C8X2 THIS BLOCK IS FOR IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES ONLY  Personal Data – Privacy Act of 1974   PRINTED NAME OF TRAINEE (Last, First, Middle Initial)  INITIALS (Written) LAST 4 OF SSAN PRINTED NAME OF TRAINER AND CERTIFYING OFFICIAL AND WRITTEN INITIALS N/I N/I N/I N/I N/I N/I   N/I N/I N/I N/I N/I N/I  38 Attachment 2  - SCALE VALUE DEFINITION:  The individual PROFICIENCY CODE KEY STS 1C8X2  ksaT ecnamrofreP sleveL ksaT* egdelwonK sleveLj tcebuS**l egdewonK sleveL1 2 3 4 a b c d A B C D Can do simple parts of the task.

(PRINCIPLES) Can analyze facts and principles and draw conclusions about the subject.  (ANALYSIS) Can evaluate conditions and make proper decisions about the subject.  (EVALUATION) Explanations * A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.  (Example: b and 1b) **  A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks.  This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC. (-)  This mark is used alone in Proficiency Codes Course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources. NOTE:  All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime. (-)  When this code is used in the Core & Wartime Tasks Column it indicates that the qualification is a local determination. (5)  When this code is used in the Core & Wartime Tasks Column it indicates the CFM has mandated this task as a core 5-level requirement.  The training to satisfy this requirement is either provided through OJT, CBTs, CDCs, or a combination. (7)  When this code is used in the Core & Wartime Tasks Column it indicates the CFM has mandated this task as a core 7-level requirement.  The training to satisfy this requirement is either provided through OJT, CBTs, CDCs, or a combination.    39 Attachment 2 1.  TASKS, KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNICAL REFERENCES 1.

Measurement.  Each objective is indicated as follows:  W indicates task or subject knowledge which is measured using a written test, PC indicates required task performance which is measured with a performance progress check and PC/W indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a progress check. 5.  Standard.  The standard is 70% on written examinations.  Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. 6.  Proficiency Level.  Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step by step procedures for doing the task. Section C - Support Materials 7.
