When  an  acquiring  component  envisions  transfer  of  management responsibility for a system or equipment to another component, a joint Technical Manual (TM) transfer team will facilitate the smooth, incremental transfer of TM management responsibility.  The  team  will  review  the  TMs  outlined  in  a  TM  transfer  review  plan.    A  transfer  typically includes all TMs and all TM family increments in the affected TM series.  The need to update existing TMs will not prevent equipment or TM management responsibility transfer.  The team will  identify  those  TMs  that  are  not  current  and  require  updating  and  identify  transfer requirements for digital editable copy of text and graphics (if available), digital distribution files and  printed  stock.      The  team  will  also  propose  how,  when  and  who  should  accomplish  the updates. 5.2.  Transferring Acquiring Component Responsibilities.  The transferring component will: 5.2.1.  Arrange  for  a  meeting  of  all  interested  personnel,  including  receiving  component personnel,  to  establish  a  joint  TM  transfer  team.    The  transferring  component  will  chair subsequent team meetings. 5.2.2.  Develop a mutually acceptable, transfer review plan outlining the TMs to be reviewed, the percentage of review for each and a time schedule. 5.2.3.  As specified in the transfer review plan, have available for review: 5.2.3.1.  All  documentation  for  examination  to  determine  that  TMs  and  source  data  are complete and agree with the configuration of the system or equipment being transferred. 5.2.3.2.
