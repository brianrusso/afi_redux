Purpose. The purpose of this instruction is to implement direction from the Secretary of  the  Air  Force  (SECAF)  as  outlined  in  AFPD  23-1,  Materiel  Management.  This  policy provides direction for determining and stocking materiel requirements, cataloging, ordering, sourcing, receiving, delivering, and return/disposal of materiel for Class IX repair parts and select  Class  VII  major  end  items  and  Class  II  items  as  identified  and  approved  by Headquarters  Air  Force  (HAF).  Additionally,  guidance  for  other  classes  of  supply,  such  as Class V munitions is covered in specific subject areas. These references will be specifically enumerated where applicable. 1.1.2.1.  This  instruction  supports  the  Integrated  Life  Cycle  Management  (ILCM) Enterprise  chain  by  providing  applicable  materiel  management  guidance  to  ensure  the warfighter  receives  the  right  support  at  the  right  place  and  the  right  time.  Additionally, this  guidance  supports  the  Air  Force  Expeditionary  Logistics  for  the  21st  Century (eLog21)  umbrella  strategy  that  integrates  and  governs  logistics  transformation initiatives. 1.1.2.2.  Delegation of Authority: Air Force (AF). AF/A4 Logistics, Engineering & Force Protection  delegates  responsibility  for  procedural  guidance  development  to  Air  Force Materiel Command (AFMC): 1.1.2.2.1.  Provisioning 1.1.2.2.2.  Wholesale receipt processing 1.1.2.2.3.  Item Management (IM) 1.1.2.2.4.  Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) 1.1.2.2.5.

AFMC  shall  develop  separate  24/7  procedural  guidance  for  supply  chain operations activities to implement enterprise level support as required. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 9 1.1.3.  Scope. AF policy requires all government-owned property to be under the control of a responsible Accountable Officer (AO) at all times. The AO’s to which this instruction applies are: 1.1.3.1.  AF organizations under the direct jurisdiction of the CSAF. 1.1.3.2.  AF  organizations  under  the  jurisdiction  of  overseas  commands  instructed  to maintain formal stock record accounts. 1.1.3.3.  Designated  agencies  accessing  the  AF  materiel  management  system,  unless specifically exempted by the CSAF. 1.1.3.4.  Supply Chain Management (SCM) operations providing direct support to the F-35  platform  will  use  this  instruction  as  fundamental  baseline  for  materiel  management knowledge  and  guidance.    The  F-35  SCM  processes  will  be  managed  IAW  F-35  Joint Program Office (JPO) approved guidance.  (T-1) 1.1.4.  Compliance  Terminology.  For  the  purposes  of  this  instruction,  the  following definitions apply: 1.1.4.1.  Shall,  Must,  Will  -  Indicate  mandatory  requirements.  (Will  is  also  used  to express a declaration of purpose for a future event.) 1.1.4.2.  Should - Indicates a preferred method of accomplishment. 1.1.4.3.  May - Indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.1.5.  Construct.  This  instruction  has  the  same  construct  as  AFMAN  23-122  and  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1.  While  not  all  sections  within  AFI  23-101  have  associated  procedures enumerated  in  AFMAN  23-122  or  processes  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  those  sections where procedures/processes are detailed have the same section titles. For example, Sec. 5D, Equipment Management is the same section in AFI 23-101, AFMAN 23-122, and AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Chapter 5. 1.1.5.1.  Users  are  encouraged  to  refer  to  Attachment  1  and  Attachment  2  for  reference information  as  well  as  identification  of  legacy  AF  supply  chain  functions  with  updated terminology. 1.1.5.2.  References to materiel management systems. This instruction provides guidance which  properly  should  not  be  predicated  on  systems’  capabilities.  Guidance  shall  drive systems requirements. As such, the vast majority of references to systems information in this  instruction  are  systems  “neutral”  and  are  referred  to  as  “materiel  management  IT systems” or similar terminology. AFI 23-101’s  “companion” publications, AFMAN 23- 122 and AFH 23-123 provide more specific systems references (e.g. Integrated Logistics Support-Supply (ILS-S), Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS). 1.1.6.  Supplements.  This  instruction  may  be  supplemented  no  lower  than  the  Major Command  (MAJCOM)  level  unless  otherwise  indicated.  MAJCOMs  supplementing  this instruction  must  coordinate  with  AF/A4LR  and  will  follow  guidance  in  AFI  33-360, Publications and Forms Management. 10 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 Section 1B—Organization Structure and Responsibilities 1.2.

Ensure asset data is available for use. 2.2.3.1.13.  Ensure there are adequate quality control procedures established to verify and validate the data and critical factors that affect requirements computations. 2.2.3.2.  Categories and Characteristics of Consumable Items: 2.2.3.2.1.  An  item  categorized  as  a  consumable  is  an  item  of  supply  (except explosive ordnance and  major end items  of equipment) that’s normally  expended or used up beyond recovery in the use for which it is designed or intended. 2.2.3.2.2.  Categorize  consumables  according  to  the  Expendability,  Recoverability, and Reparability Category (ERRC). See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability, Cost Designators (ERRCD). 2.2.3.2.2.1.  Consumables  may  be  expendable  and  non-reparable  (XB3)  or expendable and field repairable (XF3). items  may  be 2.2.3.2.2.1.1.  XB3 (cleaned,  painted, straightened, sharpened, etc.) by users. XB3 items costing $50 or more may be authorized  repair  by  the  competent  maintenance  authority  at  organizational and intermediate levels. reconditioned 2.2.3.2.2.1.2.  Don’t  return  unserviceable  goods  marked  XF3  to  the  depot  or specialized  repair  unit.  Mark  XF3  items  that  cannot  be  restored  at  the  retail maintenance level and transfer them to servicing DLADS. 2.2.3.2.2.2.  Non-working  capital requirements. funds items  are  categorized  as  EOQ 2.2.3.2.2.2.1.  Derive  the  EOQ  requirement  from  a  mathematical  equation both  for wholesale  and retail.  For consistency, wholesale and retail  activities share computational methodology. 2.2.3.3.  Consumable Item Computational Guidance: 2.2.3.3.1.  Use the EOQ to: 2.2.3.3.1.1.  Minimize the total cost of ordering and holding inventories. 2.2.3.3.1.2.  Compute  peacetime  and  WRM  purchase consumables. requirements for 36 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 2.2.3.3.1.3.  Develop categories for budgeting and evaluating inventory. 2.2.3.3.2.  Consider requirements to fill. the importance  of  each  mission in  determining  which 2.2.3.4.  Consumable Item Computing Requirements: 2.2.3.4.1.  Determine  EOQ  at  the  wholesale  level  for  a  maximum  of  24  months demand. To determine the minimum EOQ, use either the Administrative Lead Time (ALT) or 6 months, whichever is less. 2.2.3.4.1.1.  The  EOQ  minimum  level  may  be  overridden  if  a  lesser  quantity  is demonstrably more cost effective. 2.2.3.4.1.2.  AFMC  may  adjust  the  maximum  EOQ  downward  to  ensure  they operate within budget. 2.2.3.4.1.3.  Adjust  EOQ  downward  for  phased-out  end  items  or  those  declining in demand. 2.2.3.4.2.  Determine EOQ at the retail level-for a maximum of 12 months demand. 2.2.3.4.2.1.  Adjust  EOQ  downward  for  phased-out  end  items  or  declining  in demand. 2.2.3.4.2.2.  Override  the  targeted  EOQ  requirement  when  more  cost-effective quantity is documented. 2.2.3.4.3.  Estimate projections for demand-based requirements using past records of recurring demand. Factor in serviceable returns. 2.2.3.4.3.1.  Purchase demand-based items when demand for items exceeds goods on-hand and on order. 2.2.3.4.3.2.  Determine the reorder point by adding together the ALT, stock due-out  quantity,  variable  safety  level  and  applicable  non-demand-based  additive requirements. 2.2.3.4.3.2.1.  Determine  the  variable  safety  level  to  augment  the  operating level  of  supply.  This  allows  for  continuous  operations  when  demand  rises steeply  or when lead-time is  extended. Decrease  safety levels  as  fluctuations even out. 2.2.3.4.3.2.2.  Determine non-demand-based requirements for goods that have limited or no demand history, but qualify for purchase based on other criteria. Two  types  of  non-demand-based  requirements  are  insurance  (INS)  and calendar time change items. 2.2.3.4.3.2.3.  Identify essential items with no demand records or forecast for failure  reports  and  stock  them  at  the  wholesale  level  as  INS  items.  These should  not  exceed  the  cost  of  one  minimum  replacement  unit  without documentation and justification of the added cost. 2.2.3.4.3.2.4.  Determine additive requirements to identify items not supported by past demand records. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 37 2.2.3.4.3.2.4.1.  Document and validate these requirements for authorization at both the retail and wholesale levels. 2.2.3.4.3.2.4.2.  Request  authorization  for  additive  requirements  when laying in stock at a base or adding stock to support a net increase in end item population or in base deployments. 2.2.3.4.3.2.4.3.  Use  the  additive  requirement  for  items  such  as  those  with calendar time changes, short shelf-life and short program life. 2.2.3.4.3.2.4.4.  Request  additive  requirement  authorization  for  modified items and applications that can’t adapt for use with the EOQ formula. 2.2.3.5.  Consumable Item Reporting Stratification. 2.2.3.5.1.  Use  stratification  reports item  purchasing  and  depot maintenance  budgets;  determine  readiness  status  of  inventories;  and  relate  assets  to the approved acquisition objective, other authorized retention of stock, and potential for reusing or disposing of materiel. to  develop 2.2.3.5.1.1.  Maintain  an  audit  trail  if  a  method  other  than  stratification  for budgeting is utilized. 2.2.3.5.2.  Develop  wholesale  and  retail  dollar  value  stratification  summaries outlining  individual  item  asset  and  requirement  comparisons.  Stratify  consumable items at least semiannually to reflect inventory as of September 30 (consulted during inventory  reporting  and  funding  reviews)  and  once  to  reflect  inventory  as  of  March 31 (used for budget preparation). 2.2.3.6.  Reparable  Item  Computation.  The  AF  reparable  requirements  computation system  will  be  forward-looking  using  past  usage  that  is  converted  to  a  demand  rate.  It will apply this rate to project future usage. The reparable item computation will be used to  develop  inventory  stratification  tables  needed  for  budget  submission  and  inventory evaluation. 2.2.3.6.1.  Categories and Characteristics of Reparable Items: 2.2.3.6.1.1.  An  item  categorized  as  a  reparable  is  an  item  of  supply  (except explosive ordnance and major end items of equipment) is subject to repair cycle control. 2.2.3.6.1.2.  Removal of a malfunctioning reparable item is normally followed by a request to supply for a replacement item. 2.2.3.6.1.3.  When  the  replacement  request  either  issues  or  backorders,  the removed item will normally be automatically placed under DIFM control. 2.2.3.6.1.4.  Refer  to  AFMAN  23-122,  Sec.  4C,  Repair  for  DIFM  return procedures. Categorize reparables according to the ERRC. See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for ERRCDs. 2.2.3.6.1.5.  Reparable  may  be  both  field  reparable  (XF3)  and  depot  reparable (XD2). 38 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 2.2.3.6.2.  Requirements  Computation.  Requirements  for  spares  support  consists  of the following elements. (Ref. Attach 1, Glossary for more detail on terms) 2.2.3.6.2.1.  Base Stock Level. 2.2.3.6.2.2.  Base Repair Cycle. 2.2.3.6.2.3.  Order and Shipping Time (O&ST). 2.2.3.6.2.4.  Safety Level. 2.2.3.6.2.5.  Negotiated Level. 2.2.3.6.2.6.  Depot Stock Levels. 2.2.3.6.2.7.  Depot Repair Cycle. 2.2.3.6.2.8.  Procurement Lead Time. 2.2.3.6.2.9.  Operating Requirement. 2.2.3.6.2.10.  Condemnation Requirement. 2.2.3.6.2.11.  Additive Requirement. 2.2.3.7.  Non-demand-Based Requirements. Items with limited or no-demand history, but qualify  for  stockage  based  on  other  criteria.  Three  types  of  non-demand-based requirements are for INS, Numeric Stockage Objective (NSO), and calendar time change items. 2.2.3.7.1.  No  Demands.  Essential  items  with  no  demands  or  forecast  of  failure  will be identified and stocked as determined by AFMC as INS items and will not exceed one minimum replacement unit unless fully justified and documented. 2.2.3.7.2.  Low  or  Sporadic  Demands.  Essential  items  with  demands  or  forecast  of failure  with  either  low  or  sporadic  will  be  treated  as  NSO.  These  items  will  be stocked in minimum quantities. 2.2.3.7.2.1.  Additive  Requirements.  Additional  requirements  authorized  for initial lay-in of base stocks and to support a net increase in end item population or planned  base  deployments.  May  be  used  for  items  such  as  those  with  calendar time  changes,  short  shelf-life  and  short  program  life  items,  or  for  modifications and other applications that are not computing in the computation. 2.2.3.8.  Asset  usage  data  is  data  necessary  for  the  computation  of  requirements.  Asset usage data will be obtained from appropriate IT systems, stock balance and consumption reports as well as any other official source. Asset and usage data will include: 2.2.3.8.1.  Worldwide  Assets.  All  serviceable  and  unserviceable  assets,  including DIFM and TO compliance at both wholesale and retail level. 2.2.3.8.2.  On-Order Assets. On-order assets include firm quantities due-in obtainable through the Interservice Supply Support Program (ISSP); items bailed to contractors; quantities  subject  to  contract  termination,  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS);  customer excess; and assets from reclamation. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 39 2.2.3.9.  Materiel Programs. Inventory positions or levels of activity will be expressed in terms of hours, months, units, overhauls or recoveries. These include: 2.2.3.9.1.  Past Programs. Statements of actual inventory or accomplishments during a specific past period. 2.2.3.9.2.  Projected Programs. Estimates of planned inventory and accomplishments during a future period. 2.2.3.9.3.  Organizational Intermediate Maintenance (OIM) Programs. 2.2.3.9.4.  Depot Level Maintenance (DLM) Programs. 2.2.3.10.  Consumption  Rate  Development.  These  rates  will  be  computed  from  base consumption information and depot reparable generations. 2.2.3.10.1.  Base Consumption Rates. Base consumption rates will be determined by taking the number of failures at base level, over a specific period of time, divided by the operating program for that same time period. Base consumption rates include (ref. Attach 1, Glossary for more detail on terms): 2.2.3.10.1.1.  Total OIM Demand Rate. 2.2.3.10.1.2.  Base Condemnation Rate. 2.2.3.10.1.3.  Base NRTS Rate. 2.2.3.10.2.  Depot  Consumption  Rates.  These  rates  will  be  computed  using  the number of failures at depot level divided by the appropriate depot program. 2.2.3.11.  New Items. 2.2.3.11.1.  Initial Requirements Quantity. This quantity will be calculated as the total of  ERRCD  XD2  items  needed  to  support  a  program  time  span  equal  to  the Procurement Lead Time (PCLT), plus an operating period of 3 months (lead time plus 3 months), which will be at least 12 months. The operating period will allow for the conversion from  the initial  requirements  computation to  the recurring  replenishment computation.  Compute  quantities  for  the  operating  period,  base  and  depot  repair cycle, and if authorized, additive requirements not covered by other segments. 2.2.3.12.  Reparable  Item  Stratification  Reports  will  be  generated  in  the  applicable  IT system  from  the  requirements  determination  process.  They  will  be  used  to  uniformly portray  the  materiel  requirements  and  available  assets  (on-hand  and  on-order)  of individual items at the wholesale and retail levels. 2.2.3.12.1.  The  wholesale  level  will  develop  dollar  value  stratification  summaries depicting individual item asset and requirement comparisons. Reparable items will be stratified quarterly, unless waived. Stratification cutoff dates will be 30 Sep, 31 Dec, 31 Mar and 30 Jun of each fiscal year. 2.2.3.13.  Centrally Managed Equipment. 2.2.3.13.1.  Criteria: 2.2.3.13.1.1.  Assigned Procurement Source Code (PSC). 5. 2.2.3.13.1.2.  Separate,  primary,  end  item  (other  than  the  weapon  itself),  needed 40 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 by an individual or organization to perform an assigned mission. 2.2.3.13.1.3.  Assigned ERRC ND or NF. 2.2.3.13.2.  Equipment will be acquired to: 2.2.3.13.2.1.  Meet a specific predetermined future requirement. 2.2.3.13.2.2.  Fill an existing shortage. 2.2.3.13.2.3.  Replace a condemned item. 2.2.3.13.3.  Equipment  item  requirements  computation  will  cover  the  conditions above;  however,  circumstances  may  arise  which  will  generate  requirements  for equipment  items  other  than  those  identified.  In  these  cases,  AFMC  may  establish levels in the equipment item requirements computation IAW HQ AFMC guidance. 2.2.3.13.4.  Base  and  depot  stock  levels  are  not  authorized  for  centrally  acquired equipment items. Exceptions to this policy are: 2.2.3.13.4.1.  Non-expendable individual equipment. 2.2.4.  Retention. 2.2.4.1.  Retention  rules  ensure  proper  utilization  of  Government  property  and  prevent unnecessary procurement. 2.2.4.2.  Wholesale Stockage Retention. AFMC will: 2.2.4.2.1.  Retain  only  sufficient  quantities  of  centrally  procured  serviceable  and economically  reparable  assets  used  on  active  DoD  weapon  systems  and  end  items required to support the projected life of the weapon system. 2.2.4.2.2.  Retain stocks IAW DoDM 4140.01 and this AFI. 2.2.4.2.3.  Retain serviceable assets up to the authorized Foreign Military Sales Order I  (FMSO  I)  stock  level  to  support  projected  Cooperative  Logistics  Supply  Support Arrangement (CLSSA) program requisitions. 2.2.4.2.4.  Retain all serviceable Local Purchase (LP), Local Manufacture (LM), and one-time  buy  assets  for  active  DoD  Weapons  systems  and  end  items  for  30  months after the last demand. 2.2.4.2.5.  Retain  ample  quantities  of  assets  applicable  to  DoD  weapons  systems  or end items to support modified or phased out items through the modification program or phase-out period. 2.2.4.2.6.  Retain  serviceable  assets  peculiar  to  weapons  systems  or  end  items  used solely  by  FMS  customers  pending  completion  of  a  buy-out  program.  Keep  these items  no  longer  than  2  years  from  the  date  the  AF  makes  a  buy-out  offer  to  FMS customers. 2.2.4.2.7.  Consider shelf-life, storage space limitations, weapons system essentiality, population, and projected life when deciding what to keep. Regularly review retention additives  and  ensure  they  have  been  deleted  once  they  have  served  their  legitimate purpose and are no longer justified. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 41 2.2.4.2.8.  Asset  Stratification.  AFMC  will  stratify  principal  and  secondary  items  to show assets against materiel requirements IAW DoDM 4140.01, Volume 6 for: 2.2.4.2.8.1.  Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) stock. 2.2.4.2.8.2.  Economic Retention Stock (ERS). 2.2.4.2.8.2.1.  ERS is developed by calculating an Economic Retention  Limit (ERL)  which  represents  the  maximum  retention  level  of  stock  that  could  be economically  justified  to  meet  future  peacetime  requirements.  ERS  is  the quantity of stock excess to the AAO requirement, but within the ERL. 2.2.4.2.8.2.2.  True  economic  retention  criteria,  includes  evaluating  potential future reprocurement costs, repair costs, depot survival rate, expected returns from disposal of materiel, costs of storing peacetime demand expectations. To warrant ERS, an item must have a reasonably predictable demand rate. 2.2.4.2.8.3.  Contingency Retention Stock (CRS). 2.2.4.2.8.3.1.  For  CRS  assets  that  grossly  impact  warehouse  storage  space, dispose  upon  validation  that  disposal  will  not  adversely  impact  the  AF mission. The  IMS documents and keeps the  rationale for this decision in  the NSN file. 2.2.4.2.8.3.2.  AFMC  will  work  with  DLA  to  ensure  DLA-managed  items with CRS quantities are reviewed at least once every 3 years. 2.2.4.2.8.4.  Potential Reutilization (PR) stock. 2.2.4.2.9.

Assets  may  be  transferred  to  disposal  or  to  the  wholesale  supply  point before the required retention period expires if they exceed shelf-life or storage space limits.  Consult  with  the  LRS  CC/AO  or  equivalent  to  deviate  from  retention  policy when  storage  space  is  a problem.  Coordinate  with  AFMC  before  returning  assets  to the wholesale stock point. 2.2.4.3.10.  Retail  activities  must  retain  secondary  items  applicable  to  weapon systems and end items in use at the retail activity, up to the total allowable AAO and ERS levels. 2.2.4.4.  Review  PRS  (Excess)  prior  to  approval  for  disposal.  All  PRS  (excess)  items must  be  reviewed  prior  to  disposal  to  ensure  that  no  known  or  projected  requirements exist.  This  review  will  include  exploring  possible  needs  due  to  next  higher  assembly (NHA) application, possible modification to a usable configuration, uses for other than its intended  purpose  and  reclamation  of  component  parts.  This  review  may  result  in  the retention of computed excess assets. 2.2.5.  Transfer  Guidance.  AFMC  will  ensure  that  AF  materiel  management  IT  systems’ capabilities  effectively  support  redistribution  policy  to  effectively  manage  and  execute  the transfer of materiel. 2.2.5.1.  Transfers  within  the  DoD.  It  is  DoD  and  AF  policy  that  materiel  assets  be utilized  within  the  DoD  to  the  fullest  extent  practicable.  NWRM  assets  will  not  be transferred without written approval from the Wholesale IM IAW AFI 20-110. Assets of one  military  service  shall  be  transferred  to  fill  requirements  of  another  military  service requirement.  Transfer  excess  AF  assets  to  DoD  activities  using  ISSP.  Conduct  ISSP interrogations  for  asset  availability,  offers  of  excess  assets,  and  transfers.  Interservice transfers will be handled IAW AFMC guidance. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 43 2.2.5.2.  Transfers  to  Allied  Forces.  Transfers  to  Allied  Forces  are  accomplished according  to  FMS  policy  and  procedures  contained  in  DSCA  Manual  5105.38-M, Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) and DoD 7000.14-R. It is DoD policy that  defense  articles  offered  and  sold  to  foreign  governments  and  international organizations  reflect  favorably  upon  the  U.S.  Articles  offered  and  sold  under  FMS  will normally  be  new  or  unused,  or  as  a  result  of  rehabilitation,  possess  original  appearance insofar as possible and, as a minimum, have serviceability standards prescribed for issue to U.S. forces. 2.2.5.3.  CLSSA. 2.2.5.3.1.  During peacetime conditions, a CLSSA is the normal means for providing follow-on  logistics  support  for  equipment  of  U.S.  origin  that  is  in  allied  or  friendly country inventories. Under CLSSA procedures participating countries "buy into" the DoD inventory. Recurring CLSSA demands for secondary items shall be included in the computational  system  for forecasting CLSSA requirements. Assets  shall be both stocked  and  maintained  on  order  from  procurement  in  anticipation  of  FMS  country requisitions. 2.2.5.3.2.  When  assets  are  transferred  under  matured  CLSSAs,  the  sales  are  made from  DoD  inventory  financed  by  CLSSA  funds,  and  the  materiel  cost  shall  be reimbursable at full stock list price. 2.2.5.3.3.  Materiel  sold  through  FMS  under  matured  CLSSAs  shall  be  given  equal treatment  with  AF  requisitions  (within  priority)  for  on-hand  and  on-order  depot stocks. 2.2.5.3.4.  Materiel  requests  received  prior  to  maturation  of  the  CLSSA  are considered non- CLSSA requirements and shall not be provided the same priority as CLSSA requirements. Materiel may be released, but not normally below the control level to fill non-CLSSA requirements. 2.2.5.3.5.  On an exception basis, materiel may be transferred from stocks below the control  level  to  fill  non-CLSSA  requirements  if  release  of  the  stocks  will  not adversely affect the support of U.S. Forces (such issues shall not be below the safety level).  2.2.5.4.  Nonstandard  Support.  Under  nonstandard  support  procedures  the  customer's materiel requirements are normally filled from procurement rather than from DoD stocks. Nonstandard  support  includes  hardware  or  services  required  to  support  commercial  end items; DoD obsolete end items, including end items that have undergone system support buy  outs;  and  selected  non-U.S.  origin  military  equipment.  In  the  event  assets  are available  from  DoD inventories, and the transfer out  of stock will not  adversely impact the support of U.S. Forces, materiel costs shall be reimbursable as follows: 2.2.5.4.1.  When  assets  are  within  the  AAO,  materiel  costs  shall  be  recouped  at  full stock list price. 2.2.5.4.2.  When  assets  exceed  the  AAO  and  have  not  been  procured  in  anticipation of  military  assistance  or  sales  requirements  as  a  result  of  CLSSAs,  or  pursuant  to  a military assistance or sales order, they are termed Excess Defense Articles and shall 44 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 be sold in an "as is" condition at excess prices exhibited in DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 15. 2.2.5.4.3.  All  FMS requirements for nonstandard support will be excluded from  the demand base of the respective computational systems. Materiel shall not be procured nor  retained  in  stock  in  anticipation  of  FMS  transfers  under  nonstandard  support procedures. 2.2.5.5.  Transfers to Federal Civil Agencies. 2.2.5.5.1.  With  the  exception  of  DoD  excess  materiel,  the  transfer  of  assets  to agencies outside the DoD shall require reimbursement IAW DOD 7000.14-R. 2.2.5.5.1.1.  Transfers of stock fund items shall be priced at the current stock list price. 2.2.5.5.1.2.  Transfers of non-stock fund items below the AAO shall be priced at the  estimated  replacement  cost  of  the  item  minus  an  adjustment  for  age  and condition of the item being sold, if applicable. 2.2.5.5.1.3.  Transfers of non-stock fund items above the AAO shall be priced at the current stock list price minus an adjustment for age and condition of the item being sold, if applicable. 2.2.5.5.2.  Transfers  of  DoD  excess  materiel  shall  be  non-reimbursable  and  are  not normally  authorized  from  DoD  stocks.  Such  transfers  are  the  responsibility  of  the DLADS IAW DoD 4160.21-M, Defense Materiel Disposition Manual. 2.2.5.5.3.  Transfers  of  DoD  non-lethal  surplus  property  may  be  made  to  the Department  of  State  for  humanitarian  relief  purposes  pursuant  to  the  Federal  Used Property  for  Domestic  Use  Act  of  1990  (reference  Title  40,  United  States  Code, Chapter  48  (as  amended),  Section  203  -  Federal  Property  and  Administrative Services Act of 1949). Such transfers are the responsibility of the DLADS IAW DoD 4160.21-M. 2.2.5.6.  Transfer of Cryptologic Materiel. shall be 2.2.5.6.1.

Wholesale Level Redistributable Material. 2.2.5.7.1.  Review  PRS  (Excess)  prior  to  approval  for  disposal.  All  potential reutilization  (excess)  items  must  be  reviewed  prior  to  disposal  to  ensure  that  no known or projected requirements exist. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 45 2.2.5.7.1.1.

Price Stabilization. Price stabilization is  the policy  wherein  the Standard Price (SP) of each cataloged asset remains constant throughout each fiscal year. WCF  prices  for  a  given  execution  year  are  fixed  to  protect  the  customer  funds  from AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 53 unforeseen fluctuations that would affect their ability to purchase the programs approved by  Congress.  The  prices  established  for  CSAG-S  assets  are  set  on  an  annual  basis  to recover the cost of doing business. There are instances where an error resulted in a gross misstatement of a price is identified and after analysis, may be changed if the magnitude to the customer or the WCF is significant and after weighing other circumstances. 2.3.2.5.1.  New  assets  that  enter  the  supply  system  during  the  year  have  all  prices computed and distributed through the next available monthly stock list change cycle.  These  changes  for  assets  entering  the  inventory  after  the  1  Oct  effective  date  along with  significant  price  error  changes  are  authorized  deviations  from  the  stabilized pricing concept. 2.3.2.6.  Point of Sale. For non-fly AF customer orders and all non AF orders, customer funds are obligated  at  the time an order is  placed with  base or depot  supply.  For  flying hour  orders  from  approved  AF  flying  hour  customers,  flying  hour  appropriated  funds must be available before billings occur based on actual hours flown, and are obligated at the beginning of the month billings are to occur. 2.3.3.  The General Support Division (GSD). 2.3.3.1.  The  GSD  includes  all  retail-managed  (Budget  Code  [BC]  9)  expense  items acquired primarily from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). 2.3.3.2.  The local GSD outlet will act as the procuring agent for expense items required to  satisfy  either inventory levels  or due-outs  to  customer organizations. Customer funds will  not  be  cited  for  GSD  items  (unless  specifically  authorized  by  AFMC)  on procurement  documents  issued  to  commercial  vendors,  DLA,  GSA  or  other  suppliers except for initial procurement by the AFWCF as authorized in AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Ch 18. 2.3.3.3.  The  designated  accounting  IT  system  consolidates  general  ledger  balances, which  are  transmitted  to  DFAS  for  consolidating  and  reporting  to  MAJCOM,  division and  higher  levels  of  authority.  See  DFAS-DE  7077.4,  Standard  Materiel  Accounting System User's Manual for procedures. 2.3.3.4.  Reimbursable Issues. All transactions by which customers obtain materiel from the  GSD  are  considered  issues  and/or  sales.  All  issues  to  authorized  customers  will  be reimbursed to the GSD from appropriations or other approved sources of reimbursement except for non-reimbursable issues specifically authorized by AFMC and SAF. Cost Per Flying  Hour  (CPFH)  items  ordered  and  filled  will  be  reimbursed  centrally  by  the customer  on  a  monthly  basis  based  on  hours  flown.  Authorized  customers  include contractor, appropriated and non-appropriated fund activities. Expense items brought into the SMAG from sources outside the normal AF supply channels at no cost to the SMAG will be processed as a receipt without charge and issues require reimbursement, except as authorized IAW AFI 23-101, General Support Division (GSD). 2.3.3.5.  Non-reimbursable Transactions. 2.3.3.5.1.  The  issue,  shipment  and/or  transfer  of  GSD  items  are  authorized  without reimbursement for the following situations: 2.3.3.5.1.1.

Issue  of  excesses  received  through  the  applicable  materiel management  IT  system  RDOs  when  the  customer  has  a  memo  backorder established prior to receipt processing. 2.3.3.5.1.4.3.  If the SMAG is previously reimbursed, in-stock equipment may be  free  issued  when  the  requesting  organization  has  a  valid  authorization.  Note:  Verification  must  be  performed  to  ensure  a  receipt-not-due-in  or backorder cancellation without a direct customer charge was processed in the last 365 days. If either condition exists, the item cannot be free issued until the criteria identified in this instruction are met. 2.3.3.5.1.4.4.  Prior to granting free issue every attempt should be made to sell items at a reduced price. Equipment-in-stock without previous reimbursement from  the  customer  must  remain  in  stock  for  365  days  prior  to  free  issuing. Free issues are authorized after 365 days. Note: The LRS CC/AO and/or funds manager may elect to retain property, if they believe there is a potential future sale. 2.3.3.5.1.5.  Items  may  be  withdrawn  from  DLADS  to  satisfy  specific  customer requirements  and  issued  without  reimbursement  regardless  of  supply  asset position.

If the entire on-hand quantity of an item is excess (i.e. its mandatory reporting cycle is completed and is authorized for transfer to DLADS) any portion of  this  quantity  may  be  issued  without  reimbursement.  Issue  of  partial  excess items  that  are  over  and  above  a  stock  level  for  the  same  item  requires reimbursement. 2.3.3.5.1.7.  Shop/laboratory  type  equipment  (NF2,  BC9)  with  an  established equipment  authorization  and issued  without reimbursement  when  received  from  contract  termination  without  cost  to  the SMAG.

Issue of an unserviceable GSD item for a Deficiency Report when the AF  will  not  receive  credit.  The  issue  will  be  processed  as  materiel  returns  for credit.  Current  DLA  credit  return  policy  consists  of  the  SP  minus  the  DLA surcharge. 2.3.3.5.1.10.  Non-reimbursable  transactions  will  be  reviewed  to  determine whether  any  were  unauthorized.  Unauthorized  non-reimbursable  issues  will  be reversed and the transaction processed correctly so that the appropriate customers are billed. 2.3.3.6.

Returns  of  serviceable  “XF_” assets  with  a  DIFM  detail  minus  those  as  a  result  of  DLADS  withdrawals  are considered  returns  with  a  sale.  These  returns  will  be  granted  100%  credit  up  to  the requisitioning objective minus the on-hand plus due-in assets. Returns of “XF” assets FOB  or  as  a  result  of  a  DLADS  withdrawal  will  be  credited  100%  up  to  the requisitioning  objective  minus  the  on-hand  plus  due-in  assets  and  a  predetermined percentage of credit up to the requisitioning objective plus 2 years of demand (daily demand  rate  times  730).  The  percentage  will  vary  by  the  amount  of  previous demands. 56 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 2.3.3.7.3.  The credit guidance on return of expense equipment (BC 9) to the GSD is 100  percent  for  serviceable  returns  of  non-EAID  (retail  sales)  items  if  the  quantity turned in is within the stock level or there is a known requirement. 2.3.3.7.4.  Forced Credit Guidance.  Forced credit, using credit code "Y" allowed for turn-in of items under certain conditions.  The use of credit code "Y" is approved by the  LRS/LGL  prior  to  processing  except  for  base  service  store,  individual  issue  and tool issue turn-ins. Following are the criteria for using credit code "Y": 2.3.3.7.4.1.  Turn-in  of  warranty  items  for  shipment  to  contractor  sources  for correction as directed by the IM. 2.3.3.7.4.2.  Turn-in  of  quantities  issued  to  a  customer  in  excess  of  customer request. 2.3.3.7.4.3.  Turn-in  of  an  item  issued  in  error  on  the  part  of  supply.  When  the error is caused by the customer, the customer will be charged for the item unless base supply has a need for the item.  Such customer errors are to be processed as a turn-in with the credit code left blank. 2.3.3.7.4.4.  Turn-in  of  excess  repair  parts  caused  by  shipment  of  an  awaiting parts reparable end item/assembly when items are required by the base. Items not required by the base will be processed as stated in TO 00-20-3. This procedure is limited to base level transactions only. Normal credit policies apply to the AFMC depot level repair activities. 2.3.3.7.4.5.  Turn-in of a serviceable item from directed cannibalization to satisfy mission  capable  (MICAP)  condition  for  shipment  when  credit  would  not otherwise be granted. 2.3.3.7.4.6.  Credit  will  be  allowed  for  turn-in  of  an  item  having  a  latent  defect when  issued  (includes  unsatisfactory  report  exhibits/product  quality  deficiency reports  (PQDR).  Credit  code  "Y"  may  be  used  to  force  credit  at  activities  not under program control. 2.3.3.7.4.7.  Turn-in  of  seasonal  clothing requirement for the next season. items  when there is  a  known 2.3.3.7.4.8.  Current AF policy allows 100 percent credit on all serviceable IEX E and K Turn-ins, but local authority can override this policy. By their nature these items have a high probability for resale and will fulfill anticipated requirements; however,  judgment  will  be  used  to  determine  if  there  is  a  probable  future requirement for the item before using credit code "Y".  If there is  no  future need foreseen for the item, credit code "N" will be used. 2.3.3.7.4.9.  Base/unit  phase-out/down.  SMAG  assets,  which  become  excess  and turned  in  to  the  SMAG  as  result  of  base  closure/phase  down  will  be  turned  in without credit. SBSS bases will use credit code "N," and retail depot supply will turn-in under program control. 2.3.3.7.4.10.  Any  proposed additions  to  this list  will be submitted to  AFMC for review and recommended approval. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 57 2.3.3.8.  Conditional  Policies  for  Special  Areas  of  Support.  Within  the  AF,  there  are various  special  procedures  in  existence  that  furnish  logistics  support  for  peculiar requirements that are not provided in the normal manner. 2.3.3.8.1.  Local purchase (LP) support for overseas activities. LP actions will follow procedures prescribed in AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 3B, Local Purchase and Retail Sales. 2.3.3.8.2.  Local  purchase  minimum  quantity  buys.  When  the  GSD  is  required  to purchase a minimum quantity of an item that is greater than the actual need, only the quantity  requested  by  the  customer  will  be  issued.  The  balance  of  the  minimum quantity of purchase should be retained in the local GSD account. At the expiration of the retention period, disposition will be taken as prescribed in this instruction. 2.3.3.8.3.  When  items  are  to  be  assembled  by  an  AFMC  Air  Logistics  Complex, GSD  items  will  normally  not  be  requisitioned  until  90  days  prior  to  outshipment. Waivers for earlier requisitioning must be approved by AFMC and/or SAF. 2.3.3.8.4.  Disaster  preparedness  decontaminants.  All  decontaminants  for  disaster preparedness will be expensed upon receipt to a designated/requiring organization. 2.3.3.9.  Transfer  of  inventory  responsibility  for  SMAG-R  items  between  Services, agencies,  divisions  etc.,  will  be  processed  as  capitalization/decapitalization  transactions with funds provided by the capitalizing organization to reimburse the losing organization. 2.3.3.10.  Disposition of GSD Items. Excess items managed by integrated managers (e.g., DLA)  will  be  referred  to  the  integrated  item  manager  for  disposition  instructions  when the  item  meets  the  reporting  criteria  of  this  instruction.  The  decision  of  the  AFMC  IM will  be  followed  regardless  if  credit  is  or  is  not  allowed  for  materiel  returned. Transportation costs associated with return of excess materiel to the item manager will be borne by GSD. Refer to AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2B, Stockage Procedure. 2.3.3.11.  Repair of GSD Items. 2.3.3.11.1.  GSD  items  normally  will  not  be  subject  to  repair  by  the  local  GSD maintenance activity. Items in inventory, whose serviceability is determined doubtful by  inspection  due  to  mishandling  while  in  stock  such  as  being  dropped,  should  be repaired as an O&M expense to the LRS CC/AO's account. Transportation costs for shipment of GSD items to a contractor for repair or servicing is charged to the O&M appropriation as stated in AFI 65-601, Vol 1, and Chapter 18. 2.3.3.11.2.  The  only  items  that  are  to  be  repaired  at  GSD  expense  are  those  items returned as unserviceable and later a subsequent requirement developed and repair of the item is authorized in lieu of new procurement. For assets not owned by the GSD, the  owning  organization  pays  all  associated  cost  for  repair,  cleaning  and transportation. When it is appropriate for the GSD to pay for repair of items in stock, the transaction should be processed as repair expense. 2.3.3.12.  Assembly/Disassembly  Involving  GSD  Items.  Assembly  is  the  process  of combining  two  or  more  separately  identified  articles  and  the  re-identification  of  this grouping  to  a  new  identity.  Because  the  general  type  of  item  involved  in  the  GSD  is considered  to  be  a  "bit  and  piece,"  there  should  only  be  rare  instances  when  the assembled item would be a GSD article. Normally, the resultant article will be identified 58 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 as  an  investment  item  or  a  CSAG-S  reparable  item.  The  assembled  article  will  be returned  and  processed  as  a  return  to  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity.  If  the return is a GSD item, it will be subject to a credit determination under program control. When the assembled article is  identified as an investment  item  it will process  as a non-GSD  transaction;  therefore,  it  will  not  involve  the  credit  determination.  Disassembly  is the reverse process of assembly. The "bit and piece" component part will be processed as a return subject to a credit determination under program control. 2.3.3.13.  Contract  Termination  Cost  Guidance.  Termination  costs  for  GSD  commercial vendor (LP) items resulting from cancellation of LP items will be absorbed by the GSD. 2.3.3.14.  Management  of  local  manufacture  and  Life  of  System  Stock  (LSS)  items. These stocks are normally bought as a package and furnished with an end article for the specific  purpose  of  providing  spares  support  for  the  life  of  the  end  article  or  system.  Refer to AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2C, Financial Management. 2.3.3.15.  Temporary  Loan  of  GSD  Equipment.  For  loan  policy,  refer  to  AFI  23-119, Management of Government Furnished Property. 2.3.3.16.  War  Reserve  Materiel/Readiness  Spares  Packages.  WRM for procurement  of  new  WRM  requirements  are  specifically  authorized  through  the budgeting process. funds 2.3.3.16.1.  The approved WRM obligation authority provided by the GSD manager for  ordering  initial  WRM  shortages  is  a  firm  limitation  and  must  not  be  exceeded. Requirements  in  excess  of  approved  obligation  authority  must  be  forwarded  to  the AFMC GSD manager for additional authority. 2.3.3.16.2.  When  WRM  items  are  used  to  satisfy  Mission  Capable  (MICAP) requirements,  these  items  are  replaced  with  GSD  operating  obligations  authority. WRM  items  should  be  rotated  with  like  peacetime  assets  to  the  extent  possible  to assure  their  continued  serviceability.  When  WRM  assets  become  unusable  or outdated, replacement is considered an initial procurement of new WRM and must be acquired  with  GSD  WRM  obligation  authority  and  identified  to  AFMC  GSD functional  office  on  the  GSD  Operating  Program  for  additional  WRM  funding.  For WRM Funding Procedures refer to AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2C, Financial Management. Also  refer  to  AFI  25-101  for  specific  stock  fund  budgeting  and  programming procedures  for  WRM,  Fuels  Operational  Readiness  Capability  Equipment  (FORCE) and Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR). 2.3.3.17.  For  Shipment/Disposition  of  Defective  GSD  Items.  AFMC  will  determine when  a  defective  GSD  item  should  be  returned  to  a  vendor/contractor  or  other disposition. AFMC activities will assure that GSD items are properly accounted for when dropped from GSD inventory in order to prevent the loss of GSD property. 2.3.3.18.  Unit Price. Unit prices for GSD items locally procured or manufactured will be developed  at  retail/base  level  using  the  instructions  for  computing  SPs  in  subsequent paragraphs. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 59 2.3.3.18.1.  Use of SPs. Each item financed under a GSD shall have a SP which will be effecting reimbursements for sale or issue. There will be no reductions to the item record SPs in the GSD. 2.3.3.18.2.  SPs  for  items  will  consist  of  the  product  cost,  a  percentage  to  recover transportation  charges,  inventory  losses  and  other  expenses  authorized  for  payment by the GSD. 2.3.4.  Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group (CSAG) - Supply Division Working Capital Fund  (CSAG-S).  CSAG-S  is  a  division  of  CSAG  of  the  AFWCF.  The  CSAG-S  operates under  a  revolving  fund  or  working  capital  fund  concept  whereby  inventories  are  held  and sold to customers. AF assets stocked at depots and bases belong to CSAG-S until sold to the customer. This includes RSP assets. 2.3.4.1.  AF-managed  reparable  and  design  unstable  consumable  assets  fall  under  the umbrella of CSAG-S. CSAG-S embraces a multi-tiered pricing framework to recover the cost of acquisition, repair, and related wholesale overhead expenses. CSAG-S prices are established annually. 2.3.4.2.  Business  Operations  funds  the  day-to-day  operating  costs  of  CSAG-S.  The BOCR recovers costs that CSAG-S pays for ICP and Headquarters (HQ) /Command level operations. 2.3.4.3.  CSAG-S Scope. 2.3.4.3.1.  CSAG-S  encompasses  all  wholesale  managed  (BC  "8")  items  acquired primarily  from  commercial  suppliers  and  other  DoD  services.  It  also  includes  non-reparable  fabricated  (local  manufacture)  items  when  local  manufacture  by  depot maintenance is the preferred means of procurement. Assets will be used by other than depot maintenance and most bases do not have the capability to fabricate. 2.3.4.3.2.  Certain  assets  have  been  excluded  from  CSAG-S  because  of  the  special management  procedures  associated  with  them.  Central  procurement  accounts continue to finance these assets. All requests for program exclusion from CSAG-S are processed  through  AFMC  to  SAF/FMBM  for  approval.  Assets  excluded  from CSAGS are: 2.3.4.3.2.1.  Classified  Program  Reparables.  These  assets  have  a  BC  “@."  Note: This does not include assets that may be part of a program that is intended to be managed in a non-classified logistics support environment. 2.3.4.3.2.2.  Assets Managed in the AF Combat Ammunition System (CAS). 2.3.4.3.2.3.  All  Federal  Supply  Class  1377  assets.  These  are  cartridge  and propellant actuated devices and components. 2.3.4.3.2.4.  All  BC  “H”  or  “U”  assets,  which  are  budget  program  (BP)  35, otherwise referred to as munitions assets. 2.3.4.3.2.5.  All  BC  “B”  assets,  which  are  BP  17,  otherwise  referred  to  as  war consumable spares. These include auxiliary fuel tanks, missile launchers, pylons, ejector racks, and adapters that are consumed  during contingency operations and peacetime operations. 60 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 2.3.4.3.2.6.  All  BC  “K”  assets  which  are  BP  83,  otherwise  referred  to  as cryptographic/cryptologic assets managed by Air Force Cryptographic and Cyber Systems Division  (CCSD). 2.3.4.3.2.7.  Spares  for  government  furnished  re-competition  support  packages associated with contractor logistics support. 2.3.4.3.2.8.  Aircraft whole engine spares (BP 16 only). 2.3.4.3.2.9.  Missile/drone whole turbojet engine spares (BP 26 only). 2.3.4.3.2.10.  Missile whole rocket engine spares (BP 25). 2.3.4.3.2.11.  Missile Telemetry packages that are not recovered for repair (BP 25 only). 2.3.4.3.2.12.  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits. 2.3.4.3.2.13.  Pods that are cataloged for control purposes only. These assets were procured  with  program  funds,  not  replenishment  spares  funds,  and  will  not  be stocked, stored or issued. 2.3.4.3.2.14.  Minuteman and Peacekeeper Missile Guidance Sets. 2.3.4.3.2.15.  Contractor ICP (C-ICP) BC “S” assets. 2.3.4.4.  Inventory and Capital Control. 2.3.4.4.1.  The  AF  finances  materiel  support  inventories  using  a  revolving  fund concept. When a customer orders and receives a CSAG-S non-fly asset (and all non AF customer orders), customer funds are used to reimburse the CSAG-S. For flying hour orders from approved AF flying hour customers, flying hour appropriated funds are billed (monthly) based on actual hours flown. 2.3.4.4.2.  CSAG-S  operates  on  the  premise  of  self-replenishment  without  periodic appropriations.  An  exception  is  new  weapon  or  operating  systems  that  require  cash infusion, through initial appropriations. 2.3.4.5.  CSAG-S  WCF  Prices  and  Costs.  CSAG-S  uses  a  multi-tiered  pricing  and  cost structure.  Prices  and  costs  are  normally  computed  for  all  CSAG-S  items  once  a  year during  the  budget  process  utilizing  the  appropriate  IT  system  computation  cycle.  All prices are updated annually and forwarded to the bases with a 1 Oct effective date. The SP, exchange price, and unserviceable asset price are part of the stock list records that are provided to the customer. There is one price and two costs for AF-managed ERRC “N” and “P” consumable items.  There are four prices and six costs for ERRC “T” reparable items. 2.3.4.6.  The various computed prices and costs are effective 1 Oct each year and remain constant  throughout  the  fiscal  year  except  for  approved  Price  Verification  challenges and/or significant cost updates/increases. 2.3.4.7.  Interchangeability  & Substitutability (I&S) Group (I&SG). Each  price  and cost is computed once a year for each CSAG-S I&S Subgroup Master (SGM) stock number. If the  subgroup  is  one-way  interchangeable,  each  one-way  interchangeable  stock  number will have its own price, unless someone (usually the Item Manager) changes them to be AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 61 the  same.  If  it  is  a  two-way  interchangeable,  all  items  in  the  group  will  have  the  same price as the SGM that heads the two-way interchangeable group. 2.3.4.8.  Price  Corrections.  Under  certain  very  narrowly  defined  circumstances,  AFMC can authorize immediate standard/exchange price reductions/increases on specific NSNs to  promote  better  overall  supply  management  and  reduce  excess  inventory.  However, usually  price  changes  are  only  approved  due  to  a  gross  error  in  the  original  price calculation. 2.3.4.9.  Credit Indicators. 2.3.4.9.1.  Credit  indicators  will  be  used  to  identify  when  credit  can  be  given  for return of an asset without an established DIFM. 2.3.4.9.2.  Credit is allowed if an asset is in a projected buy in the apportionment year, budget year, or extended year. This means that credit is allowed if an asset is in a buy position projected from the current point in time to three years out. 2.3.4.9.3.  LRS/Materiel Management Activities may force credit to retail customers, but  local  managers  must  consider  the  effect  on  CSAG-S  to  prevent  skewing  the overall  buy  computation  process  and  the  creation  of  imbalances  in  CSAG-S  to  the greatest extent possible. 2.3.4.9.3.1.  To  ensure  integrity  of  the  process,  forced  credit  procedures  will  not be  used  at  the  retail  level  unless  the  forced  credit  is  for  the  return  of  an  item issued in error. 2.3.4.9.3.2.  This  procedure  is  applicable  only  if  the  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity  made  the  error  and  cannot  perform  a  record  reversal.  All  forced  credit transactions  must  be  approved  prior  to  processing.  For  retail,  the  approving authority  is  the  LRS/LGL  and  at  the  wholesale  level  it  is  the  appropriate  item manager. For all other circumstances, forced credit override must be approved by AFMC.  2.3.4.10.  Free Issue. A non-reimbursable or free issue of an asset could potentially result in a lost sale that has a significant impact on the ability of CSAG-S to stock, store, and issue  materiel  for  all  customers.  To  this  end,  non-reimbursable  issues  of  assets  will  be made only in exceptional circumstances. Retail WCF managers do not have the authority to free issue CSAG-S assets unless previously authorized by AFMC. Units must submit free  issue  requests  to  the  AFMC.  Reference  free  issue  procedures  in  AFMAN  23-122, Sec. 5B, Order and Requisitioning. 2.3.4.11.  CSAG-S and Depot Repair. The AFMC depot maintenance function is financed under  the  CSAG-M  Division  of  the  AFWCF.  CSAG-M  finances  depot  operations  in support of its customers. CSAG-M is both a customer of and a supplier to the CSAG-S. 2.3.4.11.1.  CSAG-M as a Customer. One of the main tenets of CSAG is to eliminate internal  billings  between  CSAG  divisions.  As  a  result,  CSAG-M  is  provided serviceable  spares  for  the  repair  of  higher  assemblies  at  no  cost.  Organic  depot maintenance  normally  requisitions  CSAG-S  parts  through  depot  supply  using  the DIFM process. 62 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 2.3.4.11.2.  In order to recover the cost of CSAG-S assets used during repair, the cost of  the  assets  used  is  included  in  the  materiel  portion  of  CSAG-M  End  Item  Sales Prices (EISP). 2.3.4.12.  Contract  Depot  Maintenance  (CDM).  CSAG-S  also  obtains  repair  services from non-Organic sources. The repair cost of an item repaired by contract is factored into the average latest repair cost (LRC) of an item that is recovered in the item's sales price. The  LRC  is  a  weighted  cost  determined  by  the  cost  to  repair  an  item  organically, contractually or dual sourced based on the percentage of repair accomplished by each. 2.3.4.12.1.  Reparable item CDM contracts will be funded through CSAG-S or O&M, Depot Procured Equipment Maintenance (DPEM) funds. When a decision is made to provide CSAG-S assets on a DPEM-funded repair contract as Government Furnished Material (GFM), the CSAG-S must be reimbursed at the appropriate price (standard, exchange, unserviceable asset, etc.) depending on the maintenance being performed, the  condition  required  and/or  whether  a  carcass  is  planned  to  be  returned.  CSAG-S absorbs the cost of GFM when the contract is for CSAG-S repair workload. This cost will be recovered at the time the asset is sold. 2.3.4.12.2.  The wholesale IM must approve/disapprove release of CSAG-S asset for use as GFM. 2.3.4.12.3.  Besides  the  above,  consideration  must  be  given  for  two  categories  of returned GFM. 2.3.4.12.3.1.  Serviceable  GFM  Returns.  These  returns  go  through  the  normal issue and return process. 2.3.4.12.3.2.  Excess GFM or Asset Removals. Excess GFM or asset removals, as a  result  of  100%  replacement  or  modification,  will  be  returned  IAW  AFMC procedural guidance. 2.3.4.13.  Missing Assets. AF  activities will not  return end items  to  the depot  for repair with  missing  components  or  parts  unless  an  exception  has  been  negotiated  with  the AFMC end IM before movement of the end item from the activity to the depot. Likewise, AF depot repair activities will not return end items with missing components or parts to operational AF activities unless an exception has been negotiated with the AFMC end IM and the affected MAJCOM. Materiel costs for missing items are not normally contained in  the  CSAG-M  rates  since  AF  policy  dictates  that  the  above  all  components  and  parts will be returned with the end item unless otherwise negotiated as described above. As a consequence,  replacement  of  missing  parts  would  be  considered  a  change  to  the negotiated work requirements and the CSAG-M is authorized to negotiate a change to the stabilized  end  item  sale  price  of  the  workload  being  performed.  Procedures  to  address missing assets are in AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 4C, Repair. 2.3.4.14.  Stock Funding of Initial Spares. To obtain the necessary stock funding of initial spares, the program management community will identify the initial spares requirements in  conjunction  with  developing  the  cost  estimate  for  the  program.  Appropriated  funds will reimburse CSAG-S as initial spares parts deliver. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 63 2.3.4.15.  AFMC Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Activity Assets. The removal or  reclamation  of  reparable  assets  from  the  AFMC  Aerospace  Maintenance  and Regeneration  Activity  to  satisfy  valid  requirements  is  accomplished  only  through  the wholesale  IM  in  conjunction  with  the  single  manager.  See  AFMAN  23-122,  Sec.  2C, Financial Management for removal/reclamation procedures. 2.3.4.16.  Contractor Logistics Support (CLS). CLS spare parts are budgeted and funded within  the  central  procurement  accounts,  or  as  an  alternative,  can  be  replenished  from Fund  3400,  EEIC  578.  The  AFMC  CLS  Manager  needs  to  advise  MAJCOMs  of increased  costs  needed  to  cover  any  Depot  Level  Reparables  (DLR)  currently  being issued under CLS. There are two types of CLS requirements: 2.3.4.16.1.  Stocklisted  assets  managed  by  AFMC  that  are  used  on  CLS  systems. Generally,  this  would  be  an  asset  common  to  both  a  CLS  and  non-CLS  weapon system. 2.3.4.16.2.  Non-Stocklisted  assets  bought  as  spares  packages  that  are  government owned  materiel  used  by  contractors  in  performance  of  CLS  contracts.  These requirements are funded with central procurement funds. 2.3.4.17.  Foreign  Military  Sales.  FMS  customers  can  participate  in  the  AF  logistics system through the CLSSA. The AF also provides support for requirements that are not part of a CLSSA. The AF primarily uses a repair and replace concept where the country returns  a  reparable  carcass  and  is  issued  a  serviceable  asset  from  the  normal  supply system.  For  FMS  reparable  support,  refer  to  Sec.  9D,  Security  Assistance  of  this instruction. 2.3.4.18.  ICS. The CSAG-S does not pay for the cost of depot repair of assets under ICS, nor does the CSAG-S collect repair cost from the customer for assets under ICS. Until the assets  transition  to  organic  depot  repair,  the  carcass  cost  for  these  assets  is  computed assuming a depot repair cost of zero. This prevents CSAG-S from collecting repair funds that  are  not  required.  Therefore,  only  the  operational  costs  are  recovered  by  CSAG-S. Given  this,  the  IT  system  shows  the  LAC  and  carcass  cost  as  equal  until  the  asset transitions to organic depot repair. If any portion of an asset's repair is funded by ICS, the asset  is  treated  as  100%  ICS.  When  an  ICS  item  is  scheduled  to  transition  to  organic repair  during  a  given  fiscal  year,  the  LRC  is  established  as  a  percentage  of  the contractor’s repair cost (dependent on when the item transitions). 2.3.4.19.  Loans.  A  CSAG-S  asset  may  only  be  loaned  to  activities  for  the  purposes specified  in  DoD  7000.14R,  Volume  4,  Chapter  4.  Loans  must  be  for  reverse engineering, sample parts, and/or if in the best interest of the CSAG-S. For specific loan procedures, refer to AFI 23-119. 2.3.4.20.  Local  Purchase/Local  Repair.  Local  Purchase/Local  Repair are not  considered standard  business  practices  within  the  CSAG-S.  If  these  options  are  elected,  they  must follow the guidance of this instruction. The wholesale IM must provide a CSAG-S funds cite. 2.3.4.21.  Product  Improvement.  The  Improved  Item  Replacement  Program  (IIRP) combines the preferred spares and 100% replacement program into one integrated effort. IIRP  offers  the  AF  a  way  to  correct  deficiencies,  replace  obsolete  assets,  and/or 64 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 introduce,  through  technology  insertion,  state-of-the-art  components  such  as  line replacement units (LRUs) and shop-replaceable units (SRUs) that are stocked, stored, and issued  as  assets  of  supply.  The  IIRP  covers  both  installs  and  spares  in  support  of  the installed  assets.  IIRP  assets  must  be  a  form,  fit,  and  function  replacement  for  the  old asset. 2.3.4.21.1.  AFMC will: 2.3.4.21.1.1.  Be the AF Executive Agent for IIRP and final approval authority for all packages. 2.3.4.21.1.2.  Initiate/coordinate  IIRP  packages  with  lead  commands  and  fund holders, and submit finalized packages to AF/A4. 2.3.4.21.1.3.  Request  SMAG  Cost  Authority  (CA)  in  the  Budget  Estimate Submission (BES) to match the MAJCOM O&M submitted to the SRRB. 2.3.4.21.1.4.  In  coordination  with  the  funds  holders,  track  and  measure  the economic benefits of the actual implementation of the improved item against the original forecasted sustainment posture. 2.3.4.21.1.5.  Develop separate procedural guidance required to implement. 2.3.4.21.2.  Lead Command and weapon system fund holders will: 2.3.4.21.2.1.  Request  funding  through  the  Spares  Requirements  Review  Board (SRRB) process to ensure funding is included in their baseline. 2.3.4.21.2.2.  Coordinate  on  all  IIRP  packages  and  provide  AFMC  with information to track and measure implementation results. 2.3.4.21.3.  Criteria.  IIRP candidates will: 2.3.4.21.3.1.  Represent  Reliability  and  Maintainability  (R&M)  improvements over  the  existing  items  intended  for  replacement  verifiable  utilizing  measures  of merit (i.e., Mean Time Between Maintenance [MTBM]). Additional consideration will  be  given  to  NSNs  associated  with  the  IIRP  that  may  drive  savings  in  a different NSN. 2.3.4.21.3.2.  Show  a  positive  Return  On  Investment  (ROI)  over  the  remaining Future  Years  Defense  Program  (FYDP)  associated  with  the  Program  Objective Memorandum (POM) in which the candidate's funding will be included. 2.3.4.21.3.3.  Be  Form,  Fit,  Function,  and  Interface  compliant  with  the  item intended  for  replacement  and  result  in  added  performance  or  capability enhancements. 2.3.4.21.3.4.  Measures of merit will be used to quantify R&M benefits. 2.3.4.22.  RSP  Requirement  and  Funding  Guidance.  Refer  to  Sec.  2F  of  this  instruction for additional information and AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2F, Readiness Spares Packages and Kits,  for  procedures  on  deployed  weapon/operating  systems  and  their  associated  RSP assets. 2.3.4.23.  DELETE AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 65 2.3.4.24.  Special  Cases  -  Repair.  Services  in  support  of  CSAG-S  assets  are  funded  by CSAG-S.  These  services  include:  first  article  testing,  condition  checks,  TO  verification and  validation,  reclamation,  on-site  test  station  refurbishment,  and  other  services  as approved on a case-by-case basis. 2.3.4.25.  Special Purpose Recoverables Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM). 2.3.4.25.1.  Initial/Increased SPRAM Requirement. 2.3.4.25.1.1.  The initial  issue of SPRAM will be provided free of charge by the PM. For the purposes of this instruction, initial issue of SPRAM is defined using the  concept  of  new  support.  The  following  provide  examples  of  the  concept  of new support. 2.3.4.25.1.1.1.  The requirement is supporting a new aircraft. 2.3.4.25.1.1.2.  New  mission.  The  using  organization  is  converting  from  one weapon system to another or the unit’s mission changes, requiring a change in the SPRAM mix. 2.3.4.25.1.1.3.  New requirement. The TO has changed requiring a change in the amount of SPRAM. the  end 2.3.4.25.1.2.  The  PM  will  fund  the  SPRAM  buy  requirement  using  initial  MSD CA  based  on item  (e.g.,  aircraft  support  or  electronics  and telecommunications)  that  the  SPRAM  is  supporting.  To  accomplish  the  free-of-charge  issue,  the  PM  will  work  with  the  wholesale  item  manager  to  acquire  the necessary SPRAM assets and have them direct delivered to the using base. Once the assets are received  at  the using base, the base supply  receiving  function will not  process  a  receipt  for  the  asset,  but  will  place  the  asset  directly  on  the customer's SPRAM detail (K detail). 2.3.4.25.1.3.  Required initial SPRAM could be satisfied through on-hand supply balances, if the asset is in an excess position. 2.3.4.25.1.3.1.  When  assets  are  at  bases  other  than  the  requesting  base,  the PM,  working  with  the  wholesale  item  manager,  will  process  RDO  for  those assets.  The  receiving  base  supply  will  take  the  necessary  action  to  place  the asset  on  the  customer's  SPRAM  detail.  The  PM  will  use  O&M  funds  to support all RDO actions. 2.3.4.25.1.3.2.  When  assets  are  at  the  base  requesting  the  SPRAM,  the requesting  base  supply  will  issue  the  asset  to  the  requesting  activity,  which will  pay  SP  for  the  transaction.  In  turn,  the  PM  will  work  with  their  FM offices to reimburse the base requesting the SPRAM using O&M funds. be funded 2.3.4.25.2.  Replacement/Replenishment  SPRAM  Requirements.  For  SPRAM supporting flying hour programs all replacement/replenishment SPRAM requirements will other replacement/replenishment  SPRAM  requirements  will  be  paid  for  by  the  MAJCOM or  using  organization.  Replenishment  is  any  asset  that  does  not  meet  the  criteria  in SPRAM MSD charges Exchange Price if a carcass is returned, otherwise the SP will be charged. by  Centralized  Asset  Management.  All 66 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 2.3.4.26.  Time Compliance Technical Orders. 2.3.4.26.1.  When  in-stock  CSAG-S  assets  require  modification,  the  asset  is  issued using  activity  code  “C”  to  the  repair  shop  and  the  accompanying  TCTO  kit  is  free issued (one TCTO kit for each installed CSAG-S asset requiring modification). 2.3.4.26.2.  CSAG-S  is  not  responsible  for  funding  the  installation  of  modification kits when completed as a separate maintenance action. The exception to this is when a modification kit is being installed during depot overhaul of a Management of Items Subject to Repair (MISTR) exchangeable asset. The reason for this exception is that the cost of installation cannot be separated from the cost of the MISTR overhaul. 2.3.4.26.3.  The  CSAG-S  will  not  finance  the  replacement  of  modification  kit components,  which  are  CSAG-S  items  that  are  lost  or  used  for  other  purposes  by  a using  organization.  Replacement  kits  are  financed  by  the  modification  account  that originally procured the kit. 2.3.4.26.4.  For kits that are cannibalized, the activity responsible for cannibalization is responsible for replacing the assets in the kit. As an example, if the base has a kit and needs to withdraw an asset to support a MICAP requisition, that base must order the  asset  at  its  expense  to  satisfy  the  kit  shortage.  If  a  wholesale  IM  directs  the shipment of a kit asset to support a MICAP, then the wholesale IM must replace the asset in the kit. 2.3.4.27.  Transient Aircraft Support. 2.3.4.27.1.  Transient  Aircraft  Support  for  USAF  aircraft  (to  include  ANG  and AFRC). Transient support is financed by the transient base. Parts will be backordered or  issued  from  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  at  the  transient  base, regardless  of  cost  and  source  of  supply,  and  normal  sales  and  credit  policies  apply. The  exception  to  this  procedure  is  en-route  maintenance  units  that  are  funded  and operated by Air Mobility Command (AMC) for strategic airlift aircraft. 2.3.4.27.1.1.  Issuance  and  billings  of  reparable  assets  are  managed  the  same  as assigned aircraft maintenance. The transient base will support all transient aircraft using  a  Type  Organization  Code  3  organization  cost  center  record  (OCCR), preferably via a dedicated transient alert or “TA” OCCR. Naturally, the transient base has an opportunity to repair the asset if a repair shop is loaded on the repair cycle  record.  The  repair  shop  returns  serviceable  assets  at  Exchange  Price  and unserviceable assets receive no credit. 2.3.4.27.1.1.1.  If there is no repair shop loaded on the repair cycle record for that  reparable  asset  at  the  transient  base,  the  asset  is  tagged  Not  Reparable This Station (NRTS) by maintenance. It is then shipped by supply directly to the depot  maintenance facility for repair, or the  Consolidated Repair Facility (CRF) for those units under the alternate maintenance concept. 2.3.4.27.1.1.2.  If the transient base has a repair shop, the unserviceable asset is transferred to that shop using the original document number of the asset that was issued. The original issue document number should be used through the entire  repair  cycle  until  returned.  The  repair  shop  has  the  option  to  either AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 67 NRTS  the  asset  or  it  can  repair  the  item  and  return  the  serviceable  asset  to supply. The cost of SRU/bits and pieces used is recorded against the transient base repair activity. For assets ordered in support of the flying hour program, there is no charge or credit at the item level as reimbursement to WCF is made through  the  CPFH  process,  for  non-fly  assets  item  level  prices  and  credit return policies apply. 2.3.4.27.1.1.3.  Aircraft deployed or temporarily transferred from another base for an exercise, deployed operations, or other reasons (such as runway repair at their home station) are not considered transient and will not be issued parts using  the  above  transient  rules.  Such  deployed  aircraft  will  be  supported  via establishment  and  use  a  dedicated  Project  Funds  Management  Record (PFMR) and Type Org Code 3 OCCR. 2.3.4.27.1.1.3.1.  The  one  exception  to  the  deployed  aircraft  rule  is  when aircraft  are  deployed  to  or  operating  from  another  base  with  a  PFMR  and OCCR  linked  to  that  same  MDS  and  MAJCOM  already  loaded  at  the operating site. If a PFMR and OCCR are already in place for the same MDS and  MAJCOM,  there  is  no  need  to  create  a  new  PFMR  &  OCCR  for  the deployed aircraft, though the local  LRS/Materiel Management Activity has the option of directing the customer to create and use a new OCCR linked to the preexisting PFMR. 2.3.4.27.1.1.3.2.  CAM-type  PFMRs  &  OCCRs  will  be  established  for “regular”  customer  Wings  which  are  deployed  to  or  receive  transient support at a given base three or more times in a calendar year. See above for guidance on MAJCOM/MDS business rules. 2.3.4.27.2.  Transient Aircraft Support for other Services (US Navy, Army, etc.) and Agencies  (National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA),  Department  of Homeland Security, etc.). Transient aircraft support is financed by the transient base.  If  parts  are  issued  from  base  supply  at  the  transient  base,  normal  sales  and  credit policies apply, except other services or agencies will always pay SP for assets issued. 2.3.4.27.2.1.  The  home  base  is  responsible  for  reparable  support  for  its  aircraft, which require repair at a transient location when both of the following conditions occur:  (1)  the  spare  part  is  not  available  at  the  transient  location  and  2)  the Exchange Price for the reparable is greater than $20,000. 2.3.4.27.2.2.  The two options available to home bases are: 2.3.4.27.2.2.1.  Lateral support from the nearest location, enabled by the home base  providing  a  funding  document  to  the  support  location.  This  allows standard  MICAP  procedures to  occur,  or  maintenance-to-maintenance channels. 2.3.4.27.2.2.2.  Using the serviceable  and  reparable  part  originates  and  returns  to  the  home  base.  This allows for DIFM control and associated financial transactions to be processed at the home base. maintenance-to-maintenance procedures, 68 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 2.3.4.28.  Initial Issue of DLRs in Support of the Flying Hour Program. 2.3.4.28.1.  Justification  letters  for  the  initial  issue  of  DLRs  are  required  to  validate the requirement and ensure funding is available to cover the requirement. 2.3.4.28.2.  Requesting organizations will coordinate Justification Letters through the organization's commander, then route them to their MAJCOM’s CPFH office. 2.3.4.28.2.1.  For organizations whose CPFH funding is centrally managed under Centralized Asset Management (CAM), the MAJCOM CPFH office will forward the justification letters to the CAM office at WPAFB for approval/disapproval. 2.3.4.28.2.2.  As Funds Holders, the AMC Transportation Working Capital Fund, ANG,  AFRC,  and  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Command  (AFSOC)  will approve/disapprove initial issue requests. 2.3.4.28.3.  The  Fund  Holders  will  notify  the  supported  Command  and/or  base organization of approval/disapproval within 5 business days of receipt. 2.3.5.  Flying Hour Reimbursement. 2.3.5.1.  The flying hour reimbursement concept allows CSAG-S and GSD to sell flying hour  related  consumable/reparable  spares  and  management  services  to  the  customer based upon hours supported with those parts and services. 2.3.5.2.  Each  flying  hour  customer  manages  their  cost  per  flying  hour  (CPFH)  funding centrally  with  a  single  focal  point  loading  and  executing  funds  with  no  funds  being distributed  to  the  operating  units/bases.  Funds  are  loaded  centrally  into  the  applicable Accounting and Finance IT system so that monthly consolidated billings can occur. 2.3.5.3.  An obligation will be established at the beginning of each month using projected hours flown by each weapon system multiplied by the current,  approved Air Force Cost Analysis Improvement Group (AFCAIG) CPFH rates. At the end of the month, the WCF will bill each weapon system for actual hours flown multiplied by the approved AFCAIG CPFH rate. 2.3.5.4.  New Project Funds Management Records (PFMR) for each weapon system will be assigned as flying hour program only. No funds targets will be loaded nor will funds checks be performed for these OCCR/PFMR(s). 2.3.5.5.  Billing for the flying PFMRs will be by the actual flying hours flown and not by individual  stock  numbers.  The  revenue  will  be  recorded  into  one  billing  SRAN  per customer  for  CSAG-S  and  for  GSD  for  by  the  associated  element  of  expense identification code for the appropriated funds reimbursing each WCF activity. 2.3.6.  Support Equipment (SE) Funding. 2.3.6.1.  SE  is  procured  with  O&M  (EEIC  3400)  or  central  procurement  (appropriation 3010/3011/3020/3080) dollars depending on the unit cost. 2.3.6.1.1.  SE  items  with  a  unit/system  cost  less  than  $250K  are  funded  with  O&M dollars. AFMC provides the POM input for O&M requirements to AFMC/A4F. 2.3.6.1.2.  Those SE items with a unit/system cost of $250K and above or exempted items  are  funded  with  central  procurement  dollars.  Exempted  items  are  all  vehicles, AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 69 items  in  support  of  PEO  programs,  munitions  and  associated  equipment,  automatic test systems, and night vision goggles. Requirements for central procurement dollars for  the  items/programs  that  fall  into  this  category  are  placed  in  the  POM  by  the MAJCOM.  These  items  are  budgeted  using  Procurement  Documents  (PDOCs) submitted to Congress through SAF/AQX. PDOCs reflect the decisions of the POM submissions. 2.3.6.1.3.  Active  Duty  Air  Force    O&M  funding  for  the  procurement  of  support equipment  requirements  (EEIC  63812,  63883,  63884)  will  be  centralized  under  the Centralized Asset Management (CAM) structure Operating Agency Code (OAC) 87. HQ AFMC/A4 will submit SE funding in their POM submission and manage it from an Active Duty perspective. 2.3.6.1.4.  Air National  Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve (AFR) will POM their funding  and  manage  their  SE  requirements.  AFR  and  ANG  funding  will  not  be centralized  with  DAF  (Active  Duty)  funding  and  will  be  managed  by  the  AFMC accordingly. Section 2D—War Reserve Materiel (WRM) 2.4.  War Reserve Materiel (WRM). 2.4.1.  WRM  consists  of  enterprise  managed,  dynamically  positioned  equipment, consumables and spares that support initial operations and initial sustainment across the full range of military operations. It provides Agile Combat Support capability to reduce the time required to achieve an operational capability and/or produce an operational effect. 2.4.2.

(T-1). Section 2E—Degraded Operations 2.5.  Degraded Operations. 2.5.1.  Governing materiel management support processes must be performed in the event the materiel management IT system (in whole or in part) is not available. A degraded operation condition exists when automated systems are inoperative or other circumstances significantly impede normal materiel management processing. 2.5.1.1.  Materiel management support operations are degraded when automated systems are not accessible; are temporarily down due to power failure, environmental condition, hardware/software  problem,  etc.;  or  during  normal  offline  periods  (end-of-day,  end-of-year). 2.5.1.2.  Manual accounting procedures must be used during degraded operations. 2.5.2.  Roles and Responsibilities 2.5.2.1.  AF/A4LR will: 2.5.2.1.1.

To  the  maximum  extent  feasible  redundancies  and  failsafe  capabilities will  be  included  in  materiel  management  systems  to  prevent  outages.  However,  system outages  will  still  occur.  In  anticipation  of  such  outages,  each  materiel  management activity will maintain a COOP that addresses situations when normal system processing is unavailable and manual accounting will be required. Not all situations addressed in the COOP will require manual accounting. 2.5.3.2.  Materiel  Management  Contingency  Team.  As  part  of  a  base’s  materiel management  contingency  plan,  a  contingency  management  team  will  be  established  to maintain  control  of  overall  materiel  management  operations.  (T-2)  The  composition  of the  management  team  may  vary,  but  normally  it  will  include  the  LRS  CC/AO  or equivalent,  the  CTC,  and  representatives  from  each  affected  elements.  The  initial  team meeting  will  focus  on  assessing  the  situation  and  reviewing  the  contingency  plan.  This team will conduct situation assessments, identify  problems, and make recommendations for operation changes throughout the exercise/situation. 2.5.3.3.  System  Transaction  Recovery  (STR).  Occasionally  problems  will  occur  that cause database errors in Materiel Management IT systems. When this happens the system will be restored to the last back-up and thorough research must be conducted to determine what  transactions must be replayed/reprocessed.  Materiel management  activities will be prepared to respond to these situations that require STR. These situations may drive the need for manual accounting during the database recovery. 2.5.3.4.  Support  to  Contingency  Operations.  Support  to  contingency  operations  may  or may not involve manual accounting operations. Most contingency sites will have access to materiel management automated systems so normal transaction processing will apply. However, when systems are not available manual accounting procedures will apply. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 73 2.5.4.  Manual Accounting. 2.5.4.1.  Materiel  management  activities  will  establish  a  CT  capable  of  executing  and managing degraded operations. (T-2) 2.5.4.2.  Materiel  management  activities  will  maintain  applicable  data  prepositioned  for degraded operations. (T-2) 2.5.4.3.  Materiel  management  activities  (base  retail  and  wholesale)  will  follow procedures in AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2E, Degraded Operations. (T-2) 2.5.4.4.  Materiel management manual accounting operations are mandatory for UND A Issues and MICAP reportable transactions (e.g., backorders, shipments, receipts, DORs). 2.5.4.4.1.  Transactions are assessed on a case by case basis with  close  coordination between materiel management activities as needed. 2.5.4.4.2.  After  72  hours,  impacted  materiel  management  activities  will  perform  a daily  assessment  and  adjust  transaction  processing  as  needed  to  support  mission requirements  (e.g.,  begin  accepting  and  processing  requests  for  RSP  replenishment, single point failure, UND B, receipt, turn-in). (T-2) 2.5.4.5.  Exercises  directed  by  AF/A4LR,  end-of-year  closeout,  and  real  world  outages may be counted as a local degraded operations exercise. 2.5.4.6.  After  a  degraded  operations  exercise,  LRS  QA  will  submit  an  After  Action Report to  the  LRS CC/AO no later than 10 working days after  completion of recovery. (T-1) Note: Operating in a degraded/manual mode does not supersede the need to ensure special  handling  is  enforced.  Each  functional  area  will  ensure  that  special  handling continues to  be applied  as warranted. Special emphasis  will be placed  on the control of classified and NWRM items.

Ensure HPMSK assets are ready for deployment when authorized. (T-1) 2.6.2.  RSP Overview: 2.6.2.1.  Readiness  Spares  Packages.  RSPs  are  used  to  support  deployments  of  AF weapon  systems.  AF  doctrine  is  to  establish  immediately  premium  transportation  based air routes for eligible Class IX (a) and Class VII(x) assets from point of use to repair node and  retrograde  to  point  of  use  to  achieve  consistent  resupply  within  72  hours. Fundamental logistics warfighting doctrine and assumptions are found in the AF War and Mobilization  Plan,  Volume  I.  Over  time,  as  force  structure  and  operational  planning change, authorizations for RSP change also. 2.6.2.2.  Authorization Document. 2.6.2.2.1.  Authorizations are based entirely on formal wartime tasking in the War and Mobilization  Plan.  That  tasking  is  determined  by  agreement  between  AF/A5  (or equivalent for non-airborne authorizations) and the appropriate MAJCOM operational OPR. Authorizations for RSP resulting from those wartime taskings are listed in the RSP Authorization Document. Volume 3, Part III provides authorization for airborne RSP  and  Volume  2  provides  authorization  for  non-airborne  RSP.  MAJCOMs  are authorized  RSP  for  allocation  to  specific  units/bases.  The  only  effective  avenue  for the  update/correction  of  Volume  3,  Part  III  of  the  authorization  document  is  for  the using MAJCOM operations community to advocate such an update/correction to the appropriate Air Staff OPR. 2.6.2.2.2.  For  airborne  systems,  since  the  PM  must  build  RSPs  IAW  the  published authorization document. MAJCOMs, in conjunction with AFMC, develop the spares lists,  which  make  up  the  RSP.  The  RSP  will  be  adapted  to  fit  the  peculiar  mission requirements  of  each  individual  organization  to  which  it  applies.  Squadron  specific contingency  packages  may  be  developed  for  all  aircraft  weapon  systems  other  than strategic  airlift  aircraft.  Either  MRSP  or  In-Place  Readiness  Spares  Package  (IRSP) will  be  authorized  against  a  single  requirement,  but  not  both.  End  items  (including communications security items) with Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability and Category (ERRC) Code "S" or "U" will not be included in RSP. 2.6.2.2.3.  A separate unit-specific contingency package may  be established for each unit authorized an MRSP or  IRSP. AMC  strategic airlift  aircraft  are  exempted from unit  specific  contingency  package  development  per  policy  waiver  granted  by AF/A4LR.  When  required,  MAJCOM  will  assign  discrete  identification  numbers  to contingency authorizations provided to field units. 78 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 2.6.2.2.4.  When an RSP authorization is permanently transferred from one command to  another,  the  MRSP  bins  and  assets  will  be  transferred  intact  to  the  gaining command.  Those  items  of  RSP  that  are  not  transferred  will  be  made  available  for redistribution. When an RSP authorization is deleted from AF requirements, the using command  will the  storing  command  materiel  management  activity. Disposition  instructions  will  be  requested  through  the  MAJCOM  to  AFMC  to determine  appropriate  disposition.  The  RSP  Authorization  Document  will  identify transfers  and  deletions  wherever  possible.  Any  omissions  or  conflicts  with  the document  must  be  addressed  from  the  using  command's  operations  staff  to  the authorizing OPR at HAF, with information copies to AF/A4LR. inform 2.6.3.  Spare Parts program objective. The major objective of the RSP program is to support national  strategy  in  consonance  with  the  guidance  issued  by  OSD.  Specifically,  the  AF objective  is  to  authorize,  acquire  on  time,  preposition,  pre-stock,  and  maintain  in  a serviceable  condition  ready  for  use,  all  RSP  needed  to  support  the  wartime  activities specified in the Defense Planning Guidance and the War and Mobilization Plan (WMP). 2.6.4.  Contingency  support  for  AF  and  the  Air  Reserve  Components  (ARC)  is  provided through the utilization of on-hand Peacetime Operating Stock (POS) and RSPs. Contingency support  can  come  from  RSP  or POS  through  many  supply  chain  processes,  such  as  special levels, CHPMSKs, MSKs, and CRSPs to ensure that stocks are in place at the right time to support  the  contingency  mission.  The  RSP  is  prepositioned  at  or  near  the  base  of  intended use  and/or  airlifted  to  the  employment  bases  prior  to,  concurrently  with,  or  following  the deploying forces. 2.6.5.  The only items authorized in airborne RSP are those listed on the Minimum Essential Subsystem List (MESL). These items support a specific weapon system and generate a Non-Mission  Capable  (NMC)  grounding  condition.  Note:  Safety-of-flight  items  are  authorized even if not listed on the MESL and must be computed to the maximum extent possible. 2.6.6.  Funding for RSPs. 2.6.6.1.  Operating commands conduct RSP reviews annually in association with AFMC PM  RSP Managers.  To  update  the  types  and  number  of  parts  needed  for  right  sizing  is based  on  modifications,  demand  rate  changes,  Mean  Time  Between  Failure  (MTBF) changes  and  maintenance  experience  with  past  deployments.  New  requirements  are computed by the AFMC logistics systems and validated by MAJCOM. Programming and budgeting  for  RSP  and  HPMSK  annual  adjustments  is  the  responsibility  of  AFMC. AFMC  will  include  these  requirements  in  the  AFWCF  budget  as  part  of  the  Materiel Support Division buy requirement. See Sec. 2C of this instruction for further information. 2.6.6.1.1.  New RSPs and authorization changes required for modification of current weapon systems  or mission changes are funded through the 3010/3080  procurement accounts.  New  authorizations  can  be  driven  by  new  weapon  systems  entering  AF inventory, modification of current weapon systems, or mission changes. 2.6.6.1.2.  Mission  changes  include  changes  in  operational  requirements  (e.g., conventional  vs.  nuclear),  changes  in  number  of  Primary  Aircraft  Assigned  (PAA) supported, changes in the WMP-3, Part III, such as independent vs. dependent kits or in-place vs. mobility kits. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 79 2.6.6.1.3.  New authorizations and mission changes will be carried in an “unfunded” status  until  verification  of  funding/asset  source.  The  presence  of  an  authorization  in an  “unfunded”  status  reflects  the  lead  Commands’  commitment  to  advocate  for  the requirement  in  their  POM  for  all  users  of  the  new  kit  requirement.  The  lead command’s A8 is responsible for the POM process. 2.6.6.1.4.  Lead MAJCOM A4 is responsible for notifying the MAJCOM/A8 of new RSP  authorization  requirements  and  justifying  the  new  authorizations  to  the  A8  for prioritization  in  the  MAJCOM  POM  request.  The  lead  command  is  responsible  for addressing  the  total  force  RSP  requirement.  Responsibility  for  determination  of  the total force POM requirement is with the lead command in conjunction with AFMC. 2.6.6.1.5.  AFMC  will  determine  the  net  buy  and  repair  cost  of  new  MRSP authorizations. 2.6.6.1.6.  The  AFMC  will  pass  the  net  cost  to  the  lead  command  A4/A8,  so programming actions can be undertaken during the POM. 2.6.6.1.7.  Once  funding  is  approved  through  the  POM/Budget  Estimate  Submission (BES)/PB,  the  lead  MAJCOM/A4/A8  should  notify  AF/A5XW  (through  AF/A4)  to have the authorization moved to the funded section. 2.6.7.  New Weapon Systems. 2.6.7.1.  The initial step in RSP development will be a preliminary meeting between the PM and MAJCOM, chaired by the PM or delegated alternate, to determine when and by what method the initial RSP provisioning quantities will be computed and passed to the PM  RSP  manager.  Minutes  of  the  meeting  will  be  prepared  to  document  the  specific ground rules and method of operation. Copies of the minutes will be provided to AFMC, the MAJCOM RSP manager, AF/A4L, and all attendees. 2.6.7.2.  Selection of newly designed non-stocklisted items for inclusion in RSP must be a joint decision of the PM and the MAJCOM. 2.6.7.3.  The  provisioning  quantities  will  be  computed  to  the  greatest  extent  possible using the Aircraft Sustainability Model (ASM). 2.6.7.4.  Close  coordination  in  this  process  is  required  by  AFMC  and  the  MAJCOM OPRs. 2.6.8.  Accountability 2.6.8.1.  Equipment  items,  including  support  equipment,  will  not  be  included  in applicable non-airborne RSPs. Spare parts to repair support equipment may be included in the RSP. 2.6.8.2.  All  investment  items,  regardless  of  authorization  source,  will  be  carried  on FB/FE detail records. 2.6.8.3.  Allowance Standard items (equipment items -- ERRC code "S" and "U") will be accounted for on Equipment Authorized Inventory Data (EAID) details. Spares to support equipment  packages  such  as  BEAR  and  FORCE,  etc.  must  be  accounted  for  on  a  RSP detail  records.  The  only  kinds  of  RSPs  that  are  WRM  are  BEAR  and  FMSE/FORCE. These types of RSP must be managed IAW RSP policy and AFI 25-101. 80 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 2.6.8.4.  RSPs are prepositioned as follows: 2.6.8.4.1.  The using command will be responsible for arranging logistics support for its activities at non-AF locations in the continental United States. Arrangements with ANG  units  will  be  negotiated  through  the  National  Guard  Bureau.  This  will  be coordinated with storing/reporting commands (as appropriate), AFMC, and any other AF  command,  military  service  or  governmental  agency  concerned.  When  the designated  storing/reporting  command  has  an  RSP  prepositioning  requirement  at  a non-AF  location  and  does  not  have  the  capability  to  support  that  requirement,  the using command and AF/A4LR will be advised. The using command will evaluate the requirement  for  prepositioning  the  RSP  and,  if  valid,  will  negotiate  an  alternate method of support. When a solution to the problem cannot be found, the issue will be elevated to AF/A4LR for final resolution. 2.6.8.4.2.  When RSPs cannot be prepositioned at AF locations, the storing command will  select  alternate  storage  locations  in  coordination  with  the  using  command, AFMC, and any other affected commands. 2.6.8.5.  The peacetime deployment of an MRSP or MRSP segment will be transferred to the host account if the deployment is for greater than 30 days. RSP will not be transferred if  the  deployment  is  for  less  than  30  days.  The  using  command  or  subordinate headquarters  will  coordinate  all  support  requirements  in  advance  with  the  command providing  computer  support  for  the  deployment  (and  the  command  providing  home station  support,  if  different  than  the  using  command).  Temporary  package  transfers involving packages assigned to ARC units will also be coordinated with AFRC or ANG, as appropriate. In addition, the using command or subordinate headquarters will publish detailed guidance in appropriate deployment planning and implementation documents to ensure adequate controls over the deployed assets. 2.6.8.5.1.  Deployments  (less  than  30  days),  details  will  contain  deployment indicators, and accountability for the items will remain at the home station. Establish deployment indicators as follows: 2.6.8.5.1.1.  Continental  United  States  (CONUS)  deployment  indicators  will  be established no earlier than nine (9) days prior to deployment. 2.6.8.5.1.2.  Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) deployment indicators will be established no earlier than 14 days prior to deployment. temporary 2.6.8.5.2.  For the  designated  CSB  will  assume  RSP accountability.  However,  the  owning  base  still  retains  MRSP  Resource  Readiness reporting responsibility unless Resource Readiness reporting is done by a centralized agency. transfer, 2.6.8.5.3.  Deploying  units  will  submit  requests  to  transfer  supply  kits  and  packages to  AFMC.  AFMC  will  provide  detailed  kit  transfer  and  specific  redeployment instructions, to include a request for the latest results of the PC-Aircraft Sustainment Model  assessment. AFMC will coordinate with  the  gaining Contingency  Operations Activity (servicing the deployment theater) as required. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 81 2.6.8.6.  The  deployed  unit  CC  assigns  supervisory  responsibility  to  a  deployed  unit member  when  no  forward  supply  account  exists.  Accompanying  personnel  may  be collocated with the aviation package under control of the deployed unit CC. 2.6.8.7.  Use  and  peacetime  replenishment  of  MRSP  assets  while  deployed  will  be  as specified in MAJCOM to MAJCOM operations orders and agreements. 2.6.8.8.  Items  consumed  while  the  MRSP  is  on  temporary  loan  will  be  replaced  by  the using  organization,  insofar  as  possible,  prior  to  return  of  the  package.  When  time  does not permit, it will be returned to the organization with the existing shortages, and action taken to replace items. 2.6.9.  Review Process. 2.6.9.1.  Review Schedule and Milestones. 2.6.9.1.1.  The  PM  and  affected  MAJCOMs  will  review  RSP  annually.  The  review cycle will be timed to conclude in time for Air Staff approval of the requirement prior to the March IT system cycle RSP overlay. The purpose of the review is to update the range  of  items  in  authorized  RSPs  and  verify  the  complete  set  of  data  used  to compute  quantities  for  those  items.  The  review  will  include  all  recoverable  items. Stock  class  1377  cartridge  actuated  devices  and  propellant  actuated  devices  are exempt from annual review. Selected EOQ items, to include the following categories, must also be reviewed: aircraft guns, gun components, aircraft wheels, aircraft tires, aircraft  brakes  and  brake  components,  and  others,  as  agreed  between  the  PM  and affected  MAJCOMs.  Reviews  may  be  formal  (face-to-face  and  unit  funded)  or informal  (by  correspondence).  A  formal  review  will  be  held  for  all  new  weapon systems or end items and for all weapon systems or end items undergoing significant changes in configuration or demand rates. The decision to hold a formal or informal review  will  be  made  jointly  by  the  PM  and  affected  MAJCOMs.  When  a  weapon system  or  end  item  has  been  reviewed  informally  for  three  consecutive  years,  a formal review will be held. The scheduling of a review is done jointly by the PM and the  using  commands;  the  PMs  decision  is  final.  Once  the  review  is  scheduled,  all using commands must provide their required inputs IAW the milestones. 2.6.9.1.2.  For major milestones and  additional details  for the MRSP review process refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Chapter 2. 2.6.10.  Asset  Reporting.  Levels  and  assets  will  be  reported  in  the  Air  Force  Recoverable Assembly Management System (AFRAMS) or equivalent system using document identifier “9QN” format contained in AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Chapter 2. Storage: 2.6.11.  Storage Management. 2.6.11.1.  Maintain  all  RSP  and  peacetime  assets  in  serviceable  condition.  MAJCOMS requiring RSPs to be stored at non-AF locations will be responsible for its maintenance. RSPs  are  considered  supplies  of  vital  importance  and  must  be  stored  in  facilities  that meet the fire protection standards identified in the DoD Military Handbook 1008C, Fire Protection for Facilities Engineering, Design and Construction. 82 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 2.6.11.2.  Tenant  organizations  required  to  maintain  a  deployment  capability  will  keep the  required  manpower  authorizations  to  support  the  mobility  requirement.  Host/tenant support agreements will be established to specify who will store and maintain the RSP. 2.6.11.3.  Assets  authorized  for  IRSP  may  be  commingled  with  POS.  Assets  in  MRSP may not be commingled with POS, they should be segregated and clearly marked within the warehouse location. 2.6.11.4.  MRSP  will  be  stored  in  mobility  bins  or  in  segregated  base  warehouse locations. Items too large for mobility bins may be stored on 463L pallets for immediate movement. 2.6.11.5.  The maintaining activity must ensure that proper shelf-life control, rotation, TO compliance, and inventory practices are followed. 2.6.11.5.1.  Care  of  Supplies  in  Storage  (COSIS),  shelf-life  controls  and  other inspection  functions  established  for  like  peacetime  assets  will  be  applied  to  RSP items.  All  expendables  owned  by  the  materiel  management  activity  will  be  rotated with similar peacetime items to protect their continued serviceability. 2.6.11.5.2.  TO  and  Functional  Check.  Complete  TO  compliance  actions  for  RSP assets in the same manner as peacetime stocks and IAW applicable TOs. Functional check  requirements,  as  identified  in  Sec.  5G,  Physical  Inventory  and  Inventory Adjustments, will be performed prior to the item being placed in RSP. The frequency of subsequent inspections or checks will be as specified in the governing TO. 2.6.11.5.3.  Inventory.  All  configurations  of  RSP  and  MSK’s  will  be  inventoried within  10  calendar  days  after  return  from  deployment  or  transfer.  Submit  inventory parameter request to AFMC, IAW AFH 23-123, V2, P2, Ch 5 to update detail DOLI. All classified assets will be inventoried and store IAW AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5C & Sec.  5G  of  this  instruction.  Inventory  all  other  assets  annually.  The  materiel management activity will seal MRSP bins at the time of deployment. In addition, the gaining materiel management activity will inventory an MRSP when it is received on a transfer or loan from another unit. 2.6.12.  RSP Packages: 2.6.12.1.  Packages are developed to support the force as it is planned to exist at several specific points in time. 2.6.12.1.1.  Contingency packages are built to support the force as it will exist at the end  of  the  current  review  cycle;  therefore  the  review  contingency  package  will  be built to match authorizations for the next fiscal year. 2.6.12.1.2.  A  buy  package  is  to  be  input  to  the  next  budget  cycle  after  the  current review  cycle  is  completed.  The  review  buy  package  will  be  built  to  match authorizations three fiscal years into the future. 2.6.12.2.  Independent/Dependent Concept. 2.6.12.2.1.  The  independent/dependent  squadron  is  a  mobility  concept  designed  to recognize  wartime  deployment  and  beddown  plans  for  aircraft  units.  When  two aircraft squadrons having the same MDS are programmed to deploy and operate from AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 83 a single wartime beddown location, an attempt will be made to draw those squadrons from  a  single  wing  and  tailor  unit  equipment  and  manning  to  recognize  the efficiencies inherent to multiple squadron beddown. 2.6.12.3.  Regardless  of  how  the  authorized  MRSP  is  warehoused  or  packaged  for deployment,  it  will  be  reported  as  a  single  MRSP  of  the  Primary  Mission  Aircraft Inventory (PMAI). The dependent MRSP must be combined with the independent MRSP and will be Resource Readiness reported as a single MRSP of the combined PMAI. 2.6.12.4.  When  units  operate  under  the  independent/dependent  concept,  a  "working package" of the combined PMAI must be built. This package will not be listed in the RSP Authorization Document, and must always have an authorization factor of zero, because no such unit actually exists. It is built solely to aid in determining the quantities for NSNs in the dependent package. The working package and dependent MRSP will be built after all file maintenance has been done on the independent package. For procedures detailing the creation of the working package and  associated computations, refer to AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2F, Readiness Spares Packages and Kits. 2.6.13. Airborne MRSP: 2.6.13.1.  In-Place Readiness  Spares Package.  IRSP includes only the parts  needed over and above the normal POS levels expected to be available to a unit during wartime. IRSP use  POS  for  wartime  requirements.  The  AF  offsets  the  Total  Wartime  Requirement (TWR)  by  subtracting  the  amount  of  POS  it  expects  to  be  serviceable  on-hand,  which becomes the additive IRSP Authorized Quantity. 2.6.13.2.  The CRSP concept allows MAJCOMs to use either Mobility Readiness Spares Package  (MRSP)  or  IRSP  details  to  manage  consumable  item  support  for  contingency deployments. The CRSP process provides requirement and asset visibility, has automated transfer  and  deployment  procedures,  the  capability  to  provide  the  correct  priority  and project-coded replenishment requisitions. 2.6.13.2.1.  AF  units  will  maintain  all  approved  CRSP  authorizations  in  the  retail systems  and  in  a  constant  state  of  readiness  to  deploy  in  support  of  contingency operations.  When  reconciliation/approved  authorization  files  are  received  from MAJCOM  they  will  be  loaded  and  requisitioned  immediately.  The  CRSP  levels  for AF units will be based upon 2 years of demand history data, retrieved using the 7SC data  for  ERRC  XB3/XF3.  Where  possible  and  applicable,  MAJCOMs  should  use demand  history  from  multiple  bases  using  the  same  mission  design  series  (MDS) weapon  system.  MAJCOMs  will  use  7SC  data  to  create  a  list  of  consumables candidates.  MAJCOMs  will  compute  all  EOQ  requirements  and  for  those  items required for the LRU (attaching hardware) apply the higher of the computed quantity versus  the  QPA  required  quantity.  MAJCOM's  will  conduct  an  annual  base  level review to determine the range of items to be included in the CRSP. Units will provide an AF Form 1032, WRM Spares List with valid justification for out-of-cycle changes or items that are not on the 7SC list of candidates. 2.6.13.3.  Non-Airborne MRSP: 2.6.13.3.1.  Non-airborne  requirements  are  determined  by  the  MAJCOM.  The concurrence of the IMS/Equipment Specialist (ES) will be obtained for AF-managed assets.  The  RSP  will  include  spares  necessary  to  support  all  end  items  in  the 84 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 deploying non-airborne Unit Type Code (UTC). Equipment items, including support equipment,  may  not  be  included  in  RSPs.  Spare  parts,  to  repair  support  equipment, may be included in RSP. 2.6.13.4.  End Item Serial Number /Package Serial Number (ESN/PSN) Structure. 2.6.13.4.1.  A  standard  thirteen-digit  serial  number  structure  will  be  used  to  identify all RSPs. The PM RSP managers (or subsystem program manager for end items not managed  under  a  PM  office)  will  assign  serial  numbers  in  appropriate  IT  systems. Refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 1 for ESN/PSN structure definition. 2.6.13.4.2.  Non-airborne  reparable  authorizations  are  shown  for  the  “Purpose”  or “Mission” they are designed to perform, such as a CRE (Control Reporting Element), or  an  individual  combat  communication  system  (such  as  GRC-239,  Troop-Satellite Support  Radio).  “Purpose  packages”  composed  of  end  item  packages  for  individual components  are  built  in  D087H  and  their  supported  relationships  are  established  in the ESN/PSN Relationship Table. 2.6.13.5.  PM  RSP  managers  will  perform  file  maintenance  of  the  relationship  table. MAJCOMs will provide updates to PM RSP managers as required. 2.6.13.6.  Mission Support Kit (MSK). 2.6.13.6.1.  A  MSK  is  a  transportable  package  of  expendable  supplies  and  spares, parts  for  aircraft,  engines,  aerospace  ground  equipment,  and  communications  end items.  These  items  are  required  to  support  an  AF  unit  or  segment  of  a  unit  when deployed for short durations. If deployed for less than 30 days and support (the levels and  replenishment  requisitions)  is  from  the  home  base  or  no  replenishment  is necessary, then a MSK can be used. Deployed MSKs cannot be replenished from the deployment location, nor is replenishment for spares pulled from home station to fill MSKs authorized. Special priority or Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) project codes are not authorized for home station requisitions generated because assets were pulled for an MSK (e.g., if a part is canned to fill a kit and a MICAP is generated to fill the hole). MSKs  detail  records  are  usually  kept  on  home  station  record  with  a  deployed indicator. 2.6.13.7.  High Priority Mission Support Kit: 2.6.13.7.1.  A  HPMSK  is  an  additive  air-transportable  package  of  expendable supplies  and  repair  cycle  assets  designed  to  support  a  weapon  system  at  a  deployed location.  An  HPMSK  supports  selected  units  by  providing  a  spares  package  which contain  assets  that  are  additive  to  the  base  demand  level  and  to  worldwide requirement in D200A. The HPMSK is built to support units with unique peacetime operational  flying  profiles  that  cannot  support  with  unit  Readiness  Based  Levels (POS). HPMSKs are funded by the owning MAJCOM. 2.6.13.7.2.  AF/A4LR  is  the  approval  authority  for  all  HPMSKs.  MAJCOMs  will forward HPMSK requests directly to AF/A4LR. Only in unique situations, and with the  approval  of  AF/A4LR,  will  units  with  authorized  MRSP  be  authorized  an HPMSK.  Once  approved,  HPMSK  authorization  will  be  documented  in  War  and Mobilization Plan (WMP) 3, Part III, “RSP Authorization Document.” All approved AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 85 HPMSKs  will  be  loaded  into  the  appropriate  IT  system.  The  ASM  will  compute HPMSKs  using  the  Direct  Support  Objective  (DSO)  and  flying  profiles  provided  in the  WMP  or  OPLAN.  RSP  Non-optimized  rules  will  also  apply  to  HPMSK computations. Any exceptions to computation policy and parameters will be approved by AF/A4LR. 2.6.13.8.  Temporary High Priority Mission Support Kit (THPMSK) 2.6.13.8.1.  A  THPMSK  is  an  MSK  built  to  support  short  term  deployments (generally more than 30 days and less than 90 days) and the level/details records are transferred  to  the  gaining  host  base.  Requisitioning  action  comes  from  the contingency  site  to  the  source  of  supply.  The  “transferred  to”  base  increases  its Requisitioning Objective (RO) for the THPMSK and the home base RO is reduced by the amount of the THPMSK levels. When THPMSK is an option, MSKs should not be  used.  The  THPMSK  is  similar  to  the  CHPMSK,  except  it  is  used  to  support contingency  operations  for  a  period  less  than  90  days  or  to  support  quick  reaction contingencies  (when  there  is  no  time  to  get  a  CHPMSK  approved  or  when  it  is unknown if the contingency will last more than 90 days). Also THPMSK levels come only from the deploying unit, the home station RO is reduced for all NSNs loaded in the  THPMSK.  THPMSKs  can  become  CHPMSKs  if  the  contingency  is  extended beyond 90 days. 2.6.13.8.2.  The Host LRS CC/AO can approve deployed MSK. When the THPMSK option  is  available  to  MAJCOMs,  MSKs  will  not  be  transferred  (deployed  only). Exceptions must be granted by AF/A4LR. (T-1). 2.6.13.9.  Contingency High Priority Mission Support Kit: 2.6.13.9.1.1.  CHPMSK  levels  are  provided  from  the  overall  worldwide  POS requirements not just from the home station of the deploying aircraft. RBL levels are  allocated  in  a  way  that  minimizes  worldwide  expected  backorders.  Refer  to AFMAN  23-122,  Sec.  2F,  Readiness  Spares  Packages  (RSP)  and  Kits  for approval procedures and transaction processing to establish CHPMSK 2.6.13.9.1.2.  CHPMSKs are authorized for tactical JCS coded units supported by IRSP offset levels. 2.6.13.9.2.  CHPMSK Approval Authority. 2.6.13.9.2.1.  AFMC is the approving authority for CHPMSK requests. 2.6.13.9.2.2.  Requests  for  new  CHPMSKs  or  additions  to  existing  CHPMSKs will flow from  the requesting MAJCOM through the applicable  Lead Command to AFMC for approval. 2.6.13.9.2.3.  AFMC/SCOW  will  analyze  the  impact  (increase  in  worldwide expected backorders) if the CHPMSK is fielded and will approve, disapprove or recommend adjustments to range and depth or requested quantities. 2.6.13.9.2.4.  Information  Requirements  for  CHPMSK  Requests.    Requesting Lead  Command  will  provide  AFMC/SCOW  with  justification  to  support establishing a new CHPMSK or adding to an existing CHPMSK. The justification provides  information  why  an  existing  MRSP  cannot  meet/support  the  peacetime 86 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 or  contingency  needs  and  include  the  following  information  to  compute  a CHPMSK:  the  expected  mission  duration,  primary/secondary  units  tasked,  the number of weapon systems tasked, the number of that weapon system in the AF fleet, mission design series (MDS) tasked (model and block specific if necessary), as well as operational flying hour program, required operational support objective (i.e.,  aircraft  availability  target)  the  range/depth  of  NSNs  required,  deployed location  (including  SRAN),  and  the  recommended  MRSP to  apply  as  the  offset. Under no conditions will the CHPMSK and the MSRP support the same portion of the requirement. 2.6.13.9.3.  CHPMSK  and  deployed  MSK  are  separate  and  distinct  from  HPMSKs. When  a  deployment  or  tasking  can  be  accomplished  within  existing  flying  hour programs (i.e. aircraft are flying peacetime hours at a site away from home station), the CHPMSK or deployed MSK are the options to use. A CHPMSK should be used when  transferring  the  assets  to  a  contingency  and  support  (replenishment  and requisitioning) will come from the contingency base. These packages provide support to  tasked  units  without  increasing  the  worldwide  requirement  and  are  not  additive requirements. Therefore, additional funding is not required. 2.6.13.9.3.1.  CHPMSK  may  also  support  CRF  until  demands  are  sufficient  to establish peacetime levels 2.6.13.9.3.2.  AF units supporting split operations (deploying a unit to more than one location) or rainbow unit deployments (aircraft from different units deploying to  one  location)  to  support  recurring  or  AEF  deployments  may  use  CHPMSKs. Using  CHPMSKs  for  this  purpose  reduces  redundant  airlift  requirements, alleviates  support  problems  associated  with  the  lack  of  depth  in  RSPs  for  split operation deployments, and minimizes home station support degradation for lead unit rainbow deployments Section 2G—Contingency/Wartime Planning 2.7.  Contingency/Wartime Planning. 2.7.1.  General  Considerations.  Planning  shall  be  done  IAW  AFI  10-401  and  AFI  10-403. This section provides the basis for developing and providing materiel management inputs for this planning. 2.7.2.  Responsibilities. 2.7.2.1.  AF/A4LR. 2.7.2.1.1.  AF/A4LR  is  responsible  for  making  materiel  management  inputs  to Volumes 1 and 3 of the War and Mobilization Plan (WMP) annually. 2.7.2.1.2.  Submit  Unit  Type  Codes  (UTCs)  to  the  AF/A4LR  functional  manager, AF/A5X,  and  MAJCOM  Manpower  &  Equipment  Force  Packaging  (MEFPAK) OPR. (T-2). 2.7.2.1.3.  AF/A4LX planners shall oversee the UTC development process. 2.7.2.2.  MAJCOMS will: AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 87 2.7.2.2.1.  AFMC will assist with Materiel Management planning. 2.7.2.2.2.  Develop  contingency  plans  for  bases/forces  under  their  command  and ensure  OPLANs  are  supportable  and  Limiting  Factors  (LIMFACs)  /shortfalls  are identified and resolved. 2.7.2.2.3.  Coordinate  and  provide  guidance  with  Air  Staff,  other  Service  Staffs, MAJCOM counterparts and base-level planners. 2.7.2.2.4.  Develop  appropriate the  Logistics  Annex  and  materiel management  portions  to  OPLANs.  Review  other  portions  of  OPLANs  to  evaluate materiel management requirements. inputs to 2.7.2.2.5.  Determine  personnel  and  materiel  requirements  for  inclusion  in  the  Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD). 2.7.2.2.6.  Assess  organic  capability  (personnel/materiel)  and  either this capability  to  support  the  owning  command's  requirements  or  offer  it  to  other commands through the WMP, Part 3 (WMP-3). task 2.7.2.3.  Base level units that are pilot units will: 2.7.2.3.1.  The MEFPAK Responsible Agency will manage UTCs IAW AFI 10-401. (T-1) 2.7.2.3.2.  Submit UTCs to the MAJCOM MEFPAK OPR for approval, cancellation or change. 2.7.3.  The  AF  materiel  management  IT  system  must  support  wartime  combat  operations from any location, whether it is a bare base, a collocated operating base, and/or an existing theater main operating base (MOB) in OCONUS or any other contingency area identified in published operational plans. It must also support the worldwide deployment commitment of tactical  and  strategic  forces  as  specified  in  the  AF  10-series  instructions.  During contingencies,  maximum  materiel  management  IT  system  processing  support  must  be provided  for  direct  mission  requirements.  For  degraded  operations  refer  to  Sec.  2E  of  this instruction. 2.7.4.  Wartime  support  for  AF  forces  is  provided  through  the  use  of  peacetime  assets  plus WRM.  On-hand  base  primary  operating  stocks  will  be  used  to  support  WRM  requirements when sufficient WRM assets are not available to support implementation of an approved AF war plan. The WRM is prepositioned at or near the base of intended use or is transported to the  employed  bases  before,  concurrently  with,  or  following  the  deploying  forces.  During contingencies, all WRM assets will be integrated with and used as operating stocks. 2.7.5.  The LRS CC/AO must ensure prompt and accurate reporting of wartime stocks IAW AFI 10-201 Chapter 4 to facilitate stockpile readiness decisions. (T-2) 2.7.6.  Mobility  equipment  required  to  meet  wartime  taskings  will  be  identified  by  the MAJCOM and incorporated in either the Weapon System Allowance Standard (WSAS) or a general allowance standard (AS). All  mobility equipment  authorizations are mandatory  and will  either  be  on-hand,  on-order,  or  contained  in  appropriate  budget  documents  (unless centrally  procured).  Air  Reserve  Component  (ARC)  units  tasked  to  fulfill  the  same  UTC 88 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 deployment  requirements  will  be  similarly  equipped  so  they  can  be  used  interchangeably. These requirements are identified by gaining MAJCOMs and incorporated in the WSAS. 2.7.7.  The  Concept  of  Operations  (CONOPS)  developed  by  AF/A4LX,  outlines  materiel management operations to support sustained combat operations across the entire spectrum of hostilities. 2.7.8.  The base-level materiel management planner will: 2.7.8.1.  Coordinate  with  MAJCOM  counterparts  and  the  Plans  and  Integration  Section (LRS/LGRDX). (T-2) 2.7.8.2.  Comply with OPLAN support requirements IAW AFI 10-401. (T-2) 2.7.8.3.  Comply with  BSP requirements  IAW 10-404, Base Support And Expeditionary (BAS&E) Site Planning. (T-2) 2.7.8.4.  Ensure materiel management inputs are provided IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. (T-2) 2.7.8.5.  Monitor  Designed  Operational  Capability  (DOC)  Statement  and  Resource Readiness  IAW AFI 10-201. (T-2) 2.7.8.6.  Identify  training  requirements  for  assigned  UTCs  and  ensure  LRS/CC  or equivalent cognizance for necessary action. (T-2) 2.7.8.7.  Identify and prioritize all LIMFACs/shortfalls to LRS/LGRDX. (T-2) 2.7.9.  The  base  materiel  management  planner  will  prepare  for  the  actions  required  of deployed  materiel  management  units  deployed  and  absorbed  as  component  forces  in  the theater. (T-2) 2.7.9.1.  Home  station  pre-deployment  actions  will  be  IAW  AFI  10-403  for  the movement of equipment custodians and WRM (RSP, equipment, facilities, and WCDO) and the preparation of the deployment location (bare base or collocated operating base). 2.7.9.2.  After  full-up  communication  connectivity,  the  materiel  management  UTC  will establish accountability of deployed RSP and equipment using the materiel management IT system tied to the host computer for the deployed location. In-line processing by the host computer starts and normal base materiel management operations begin. 2.7.9.3.  Bulk shipments of CBRN/ IPE and weapons will be received and stored by the deployed LRS/ Materiel Management Activity until issued. (T-2) 2.7.9.4.  Planning  For  Redeployment/Reconstitution.  This  involves  redeployment  of forces  within  the  AOR  to  forward  operating  locations  (FOLs)  or  to  home  station.  The materiel management planner will be aware of the following. 2.7.9.4.1.  FOL  support  will  come  from  the  main  deployed  base.  FOLs  will  be considered  off-base  organizations  of  the  main  base.  Support  and  accountability  of assets will be provided and maintained by the main base. 2.7.9.4.2.  Redeployment will be accomplished by deployed teams who handle WRM. Property  will  be  shipped  in  UTC  configuration  with  shortages  identified  and inventory lists attached to designated locations for reconstitution. Reconstitution will AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 89 be  accomplished  at  specified  sites  by  deployed  reconstitution  teams.  After reconstitution, assets will be forwarded to prepositioning sites. 2.7.9.4.3.  Deployed  functional  agencies/custodians  are  responsible  for  inventorying and  processing  the  accountability  of  assets  through  materiel  management.  Materiel management will then transfer accountability back to the original unit/prepositioning site, and direct property flow of RSPs and equipment. 2.7.10.  Planning guidelines for materiel management support at deployed locations. 2.7.10.1.  The following general guidelines will be used by the base materiel management planner for operating at the deployed location. 2.7.10.2.  The  LRS  CC/AO  will  ensure  maximum  survivability  of  WRM  assets  and critical  peacetime  operating  stocks,  preferably  by  storing  in  hardened  shelters.  In wartime,  critical  assets  must  be  dispersed  and  not  stored  in  a  single  location.  Potential sortie  delays  caused  by  dispersal  can  be  tolerated  as  opposed  to  total  loss  of  critical spares. The planner will ensure planning is based upon anticipated wartime vulnerability rather than peacetime efficiency. 2.7.10.3.  The  base  materiel  management  planner  will  designate  alternate  demand processing and LRS readiness locations. (T-3).  COOP planning is essential for materiel management operations. 2.7.10.4.  A  large  workload  is  generated  by  break-out  and  issue  of  WRM,  especially auxiliary fuel tanks. Planners will ensure break-out/movement of WRM is practiced and publish adequate procedural guidance. WRM break-out and movement may be the largest materiel management workload early in a contingency. 2.7.10.5.  Materiel management planners will identify all buildings projected for materiel management use and, if none exist, plan for storage/work area alternatives. (T-3). Storage space requirements depend upon the aviation packages being supported. Special care will be  given  to  wartime  use  of  WRM  facilities  for  conversion  to  general  materiel management  storage.  MAJCOM  planners  will  pre-identify these  buildings  and binning/warehouse  items  required  to  convert  from  WRM  to  standard  materiel management warehouses. 2.7.11.  Logistics Support Decisions. 2.7.11.1.  Materiel management planning requires a review of logistics support decisions prior  to  deployments  to  ensure  selected  procedures  are  consistent  with  the  planned logistics support concept. As a minimum, these decision elements are: 2.7.11.2.  Length of deployment (if known). 2.7.11.3.  Identification  of  owning  and  supporting  materiel  management  IT  system accounts. Unless deployed asset accountability transfers at time of deployment, the home base materiel management IT system will be the owning account. Otherwise, the gaining materiel  management  IT system must be identified as the owning materiel  management IT  system.  Provide  designated  lateral  materiel  management  IT  system  support  bases including communication routing identifiers, DoDAAC and system designators. 2.7.11.4.  Spares Replenishment. Specify when and if replenishment is authorized. 90 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 2.7.11.5.  Specify if special vehicle and/or  general  purpose vehicle requirements will be identified and sourced. 2.7.11.6.  Requirement  for  base  service  store  support  and  scope  of  operations.  This requirement  must  address  whether  stocks  are  planned  for  initial  lay-in  and  means  for replenishment considering length of deployment. 2.7.11.7.  The force activity designator (FAD) of unit(s) to be supported. 2.7.11.8.  The  planned  maintenance  concept,  i.e.  remove  and  replace  or  remove,  repair, and replace or if a transition from former to the latter is planned. 2.7.11.9.  The  movement  of  retrograde  (reparable)  must  not  be  delayed.  Deployed  units must be aware of where to send reparable. 2.7.11.10.  The frequency/method for sending materiel management transactions must be determined. 2.7.11.11.  Contracting  support  and  associated  funding.  Identification  shall  be  made  of needed contracting support to provide for local purchase materiel management capability. 2.7.12.  Other Planning Tasks. 2.7.12.1.  Depending  upon  geographic  location,  MAJCOM,  and  mission,  the  LRS/CC may be responsible for planning actions other than reception. Some of these may include: 2.7.12.2.  Planning  for  Contingency  Operating  Bases  (COB)  or  Bare  Bases.  Main operating  bases  are  usually  tasked  to  accomplish  base-level  deployment/reception planning for COBs and bare bases. The base logistics plans office/wing plans office can identify COB/bare base support responsibilities. 2.7.12.3.  Noncombatant  Evacuation  Operations  (NEO)  or  Noncombatant  Emergency  & Evacuation  Plan  (NEMVAC).  In  areas  of  hostility  and  natural  disaster,  the  US  military may  be  tasked  to  assist  the  Department  of  State  to  evacuate,  shelter,  and  provide  for noncombatant  personnel.  See  the  base  logistics  plans  office/wing  plans  office  or MAJCOM A4R/A4X for unit responsibilities. 2.7.12.4.  Host  Nation  Support  Agreements  (HNSA).  At  overseas  locations,  LRS planners will be aware of HNSAs. The host nation may agree through negotiations with the  Department  of  State,  Service  components,  and  MAJCOMs to  provide materiel/services to the US Government for use during a war or contingency. Knowledge of  HNSAs  significantly  enhances  planning  efforts.  However,  the  planner  will  have  a back-up plan in the event host support does not materialize. 2.7.13.  Materiel management Wartime CONOPS 2.7.13.1.  CONOPS  development  will  be  done  in  IAW  AFI  10-401.  CONOPS assumptions include: 2.7.13.1.1.  Materiel  management  operations  will  be  based  upon  a  combination  of self-sufficiency  and  responsive  resupply  management.  Forward  stockage,  in  theater/ regional  repair  capability,  and  theater-wide  asset  management  will  be  employed, when appropriate, to support materiel management operations. Materiel management AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 91 support  systems  will  be  deployed  as  soon  as  possible  prior  to  or  after  the  onset  of hostilities or contingency and IAW current Operations Plan (OPLAN) taskings. 2.7.13.1.2.  Deployable communications to support stand-alone materiel management operations with an eventual communications link for upgrade to on-line operations, in conjunction  with  resupply  management,  are  critical to  combat  capability. Communications and resupply management, therefore, must be established as early as possible. Since communication availability is never assured in wartime, data will be accumulated and transmitted by whatever means are available. 2.7.13.1.3.  Logistics  support  may  be  limited  during  the  initial  deployment  period. Not  all  essential  materiel  can  be  initially  deployed.  Therefore,  critical  spares identified  after  arrival  in  the  area  of  hostilities/contingency  must  be  supported through expedited resupply management. 2.7.13.1.4.  Materiel management processing by deployed locations will be phased in by site as hardware and communications become available. The centralized capability provided by AFMC is particularly appropriate for supporting combat operations from bare bases or locations that are too  far from  an established materiel  management  IT system. 2.7.14.  Contingency materiel management support requirements. 2.7.14.1.  The  materiel  management  system  must  be  structured  to  provide  uninterrupted support  for  both  in-place  and  deploying  forces.  How  materiel  management  support processing  is  facilitated  is  largely  driven  by  the  scenario.  Coordinate  with  AFMC  to ensure uninterrupted materiel management support. 2.7.14.2.  Day-to-day  operations  must  mirror  contingency  operations  to  the  greatest extent possible to minimize disruption and training disconnects. 2.7.14.3.  Base  self-sufficiency  and  resupply  management  responsiveness  must  be maximized. 2.7.14.4.  In-place  and  deployed  materiel  management  activities  will  maintain  an  audit trail on all transactions. 2.7.14.5.  Theater  resource  allocation  decisions  must  be  made  within  the  theater command structure. 2.7.14.6.  Support must include the entire spectrum of combat materiel including aircraft spares,  equipment,  vehicles,  communications,  civil  engineering  items,  CWDE,  uniform items, and base reconstitution supplies. 2.7.14.7.  Prepositioning  WRM,  surging  depots,  and  resupply  management  efforts  must be  based  on  coordinated  actions  between  AFMC,  the  lead  command  and  operating commands. 2.7.14.8.  Range and depth  of support  will depend upon the nature/anticipated length  of the  contingency  and  total  units  to  be  supported,  i.e.  deployed  units  as  well  as  those already in place (support infrastructure). 2.7.14.9.  Coordination  with  AFMC  must  be  standardized  as  much  as  possible  to accommodate any MAJCOM or contingency. 92 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 2.7.14.10.  Contingency materiel management concept. 2.7.14.10.1.  In-place  units  will  operate  with  materiel  available  at  the  onset  of hostilities  and  critical  parts  secured  by  whatever  means  is  available  after  the contingency operation begins. 2.7.14.10.2.  Employment of mobile units will be comprised of two phases. The first phase  involves  deployment  of  a  materiel  management  advance  echelon  (ADVON) Team  (LRS/CC  and  materiel  management  infrastructure)  to  include  capability  of processing  materiel  management  IT  system  transactions  in  a  degraded  operations mode.  The  second  phase  involves  arrival  of  materiel  management  augmentation teams and connectivity with AFMC. 2.7.14.10.3.  From the beginning of a contingency until normal materiel management operations  are  resumed,  materiel  management  support  will  consist  of  POS,  RSPs, follow-on RSPs and responsive "Express Delivery Service" of high priority items. Section 2H—Life Cycle Product Support Planning 2.8.  Life Cycle Product Support Planning. 2.8.1.  The  Product  Support  Manager  (PSM)  is  responsible  for  developing  a  program's product  support  execution  plan  and  documenting  it  in  the  Life  Cycle  Sustainment  Plan (LCSP).  The  LCSP  specifically  addresses  materiel  management  support.  It  delineates  the PSM's plan for identifying, resourcing and implementing actions to acquire and repair spares, and  all  classes  of  supply  to  ensure  the  best  equipment/capability  is  available  to  support  the user.  For  additional  detail,  reference  AFI  63-101/20-101,  Integrated  Lifecycle  Management and AFPAM 63-128, Integrated Life Cycle Management. Section 2I—Provisioning 2.9.  AF  provisioning  policies.  AF  provisioning  policies  will  comply  with  requirements  in DoDM  4140.01;  DoDI  5000.02;  DoD  4100.39-M;  DoD  4140.27-M;  GEI-STD-007,  Logistics Product Data; MIL-HDBK-502, Department of Defense Handbook Acquisition; AFPD 23-1; and AFI 63-101/20-101. 2.9.1.  Delegation of Authority. Refer to Chapter 1. Section 2J—Weapon System Support Program (WSSP) 2.10.  Air  Force  Participation.  Air  Force  Participation  in  the  Defense  Logistics  Agency (DLAI3223). Weapon System Support Program (WSSP). 2.10.1.  AF participation in  this DLA managed program  is  required by  DODM 4140.01-V2 and  is  essential  to  receiving  the  required  level  of  DLA  support  for  AF  weapon  systems. WSSP provides Services the capability to identify DLA managed NSNs required  to support specific  weapon  systems.  AF  weapon  systems  using  DLA  managed  NSNs  are  identified  in the program by a weapon system designator code (WSDC). DLA managed NSNs are loaded in WSSP against the specific weapon system designator code (WSDC) on which the NSNs are  used  and  each  NSN  is  assigned  an  essentiality  code  (EC).  EC's  indicate  the  degree  to AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 93 which failure (shortage/stock-out) of a WSSP item affects the ability of a weapon system to perform its intended operation. 2.10.2.  Roles and Responsibilities. 2.10.2.1.  HAF A8X will: 2.10.2.1.1.  Determine  criticality/priority  (Level  A  to  C)  to  the  AF  mission  for  each system in WSSP. 2.10.2.2.  AF/A4LR will: 2.10.2.2.1.  Provide department level oversight for management of AF participation in WSSP. 2.10.2.2.2.  Initiate  annual  prioritization  review  of  WSGCs  for  systems  registered  in WSSP by requesting  a current  listing of systems  with  assigned WSGC from  AFMC WSSP functional OPR 2.10.2.2.3.  Forward prioritized WSSP WSGC list to DLA. 2.10.2.3.  AFMC will: 2.10.2.3.1.  Implement the AF component of WSSP. 2.10.2.3.2.  AFMC  ESs  will  be  primary  focal  points  for  determining  and  reviewing essentiality codes for NSNs maintained in WSSP for their respective weapon systems. This applies to ES personnel assigned to PM/system sustainment activities and supply chain  management  organizations.  Commodity  ES  personnel  will  take  the  lead assisting  AF  WSSP  Workbench  Focal  Points  in  reviewing  and  assigning  ECs  as required when systems they manage are considered “common” and used on multiple weapon systems. Commodity ES supervisors are authorized to grant access to the AF WSSP Workbench as focal points for weapon systems they support 2.10.2.3.3.

Systems  in  the  active  inventory--no  later  than  2  months  before  a system will require DLA parts support. 2.10.2.4.  WSSP  Eligibility.  Only  those  weapon  systems  requiring  DLA  parts  support will be registered in the DLA WSSP. Also, support systems/subsystems providing direct and  immediate  support  to  weapon  systems  (i.e.,  trainers,  simulators,  engines,  support equipment, communications-electronic systems/subsystems) relating to a priority weapon system may be nominated for WSSP inclusion. 2.10.2.4.1.  The following guidance will apply for nominating weapon systems: 2.10.2.4.1.1.  All  new  WSDC  requests  will  initially  be  assigned  WSGC  level  C Upgrade to WSGC level A or B will be made, if required, during the next annual WSDC WSGC review. 2.10.2.4.1.2.  WSGC  level  A  will  be  limited  to  weapon  systems  designed  as instruments  of  combat,  either  offensive  or  defensive,  issued  to  destroy,  injure, defeat,  or  threaten  the  enemy.  These  systems  require  the  most  intensive management to support performance goals and readiness objectives. WSGC level A  may  also  include  weapon  systems  experiencing  long-term  readiness  problems or  failures  of  supply  support  where  the  condition  can  be  improved  by management and resource reallocation with DLA. 2.10.2.4.1.3.  WSGC level B will be limited priority systems that are designed for and  have  a  primary  combatant  function,  or  provide  supplemental,  direct,  and immediate  support  to  a  combatant  weapon  system  or  situation.  These  systems require  intensive  management  to  support  performance  goals  and  readiness objectives. 2.10.2.4.1.4.  WSGC  level  C  will  be  assigned  to  systems  not  requiring  intensive management to reach assigned performance goals and readiness objectives. Section 2K—Spare Parts Breakout Program 2.11.

(Use Defense  Federal  Acquisition  Regulation  Supplement  (DFARS)  and  Procedures, Guidance,  and this determination.) [DFARS  PGI]  217.7506 to  make Information (PGI) 2.11.3.  The  DFARS  PGI  217.7506  requires  DoD  personnel  involved  with  design  control, acquisition, and management of any centrally managed replenishment or provisioned part to evaluate  the  part  for  competitive  buy  to  reduce  its  cost.  AFMC  must  buy  parts  without compromising configuration integrity, safety, and performance. 2.11.3.1.  Not Used. 2.11.3.2.  AFSPBP applies to: 2.11.3.2.1.  Any  centrally  managed  replenishment  or  provisioned  part  for  military systems and equipment. 2.11.3.2.2.  All  DoD  personnel  involved  with  design  control,  acquisition,  and management of such parts including, but not limited to project, program, and system managers, legal  counsel, inventory managers, inspectors, and small business specialist and technical advisors. technical  personnel,  contracting  officers, 2.11.3.3.  The AFSPBP does not apply to: AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 97 2.11.3.3.1.  Foreign military sale peculiar items. 2.11.3.3.2.  INS items. 2.11.3.3.3.  Local Purchase. 2.11.3.3.4.  Obsolete items. 2.11.3.3.5.  Phase out parts. 2.11.3.3.6.  Parts acquired under other specifically defined initial support programs. 2.11.3.3.7.  Items  with  annual  buy  values  below  the  threshold  developed  by  DoD components or field activities. 2.11.3.3.8.  Component breakout 2.11.3.4.  An  AMC  and  AMSC  are  assigned  to  provide  the  best  possible  technical assessment of how a part can be procured. 2.11.3.4.1.  The technical assessment will be based on factors such as: the availability of  adequate  technical  data,  the  government’s  rights  to  use  the  data,  technical restrictions placed on the hardware, and breakout cost versus projected savings. 2.11.3.4.1.1.  A  part  does  not  have  to  be  coded  as  noncompetitive  based  on  an initial  market  survey  that  only  uncovers  one  interested  source.  When  sufficient technical  data  is  in  the  government’s  possession  to  enable  other  sources  to manufacture an acceptable part and there are no technical restrictions on the part which  would  preclude  other  sources  from  manufacturing  it,  the  part  should  be coded competitive. Note: Component breakout under DFARS 207.171. 2.11.4.  General Guidance: 2.11.4.1.  The  breakout  program  develops  supplemental  procedures,  processes  and policies to accomplish the screening process detailed in DFARS PGI 217.7506. 2.11.4.2.  To aid breakout to competition or direct purchase, AFMC identify, select, and screen parts for breakout as early in an acquisition as possible. 2.11.4.2.1.  This  AFMC  review  should  occur  during  the  provisioning  cycle.  When parts are not fully standardized early in the acquisition process, the optimum solution may be breakout to the actual manufacturer. 2.11.4.3.  AFMC  Breakout  Program  Managers  apply  resources  and  assign  priorities  to those parts that have the greatest opportunity for breakout and potential savings. 2.11.4.4.  The  AF  may  not  deny  any  firm  the  opportunity  to  demonstrate  its  ability  to furnish a part that satisfies AF needs. For specific guidance regarding qualification, refer to FAR 9.202. 2.11.4.4.1.  The evaluating AF activity expedites its evaluation and gives a decision to the demonstrating firm or provides status within 60 days. The contracting officer need not delay a proposed award to give a potential offer or an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the qualification standards. 98 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 2.11.4.4.2.  The  AFMC  Air  Logistics  Complex may  consider  parts  manufactured  by approved  sources,  and  then  offered  by  surplus  or  other  nonmanufacturing  sources. Restrictive codes or low annual buy value does not preclude such consideration. 2.11.4.4.3.  Dealer or other nonmanufacturing sources must give the AF all necessary facts  to  prove  that  the  proposed  parts  meet  the  AF's  needs.  The  AF  considers authorized  dealers  and  distributors  identified  through  appropriate  contracting documents as nonmanufacturing sources of commercial items. 2.11.4.5.  To  aid  breakout  decision  making,  the  AF  may  use  contractors'  experience  in developing, designing, manufacturing, and testing equipment. 2.11.4.5.1.  The  AF  may  get  technical  information  from  the  contractor  through  the GEIA-STD-007  as  part  of  the  provisioning  process  or  directly  from  the  contractor, applying DFARS PGI 217.7506. 2.11.4.5.2.  The  AF  designates  contractor  technical  information  as  CTIC.  The  AF may not delegate responsibility for determining AMC and AMSC to a contractor. 2.11.4.5.3.  AFMC  request  contractor  help  in  screening  selected  parts  only  after weighing the benefit expected from the contractor's technical information and the cost to  the  government  of  obtaining  such  help.  Program  managers  may  not  request contractor help for: 2.11.4.5.3.1.  Parts covered by government and industry specifications. 2.11.4.5.3.2.  Parts that are commercially available. 2.11.4.5.3.3.  Non-developmental items. 2.11.4.5.3.4.  Parts for which data is already available. 2.11.4.5.4.  Contracts  to  obtain  technical  information  require  impartial  technical evaluations  conducted  by  competent  personnel  using  applicable  technical  data.  The government incurs no cost for duplicate screening of parts. 2.11.4.6.  Upon receipt of a funded MILSTRIP requisition from an authorized AF activity or  a  Military  Interdepartmental  Purchase  Request  (MIPR)  from  an  authorized agency/service,  AFMC  will  screen  for  items  that  the  AF  has  engineering  responsibility and are not assigned an Acquisition Method Code. 2.11.4.7.  Inadequate  or  incomplete  procurement  data  packages  limit  competition  for future procurement candidate items. Buying required data or acquiring the necessary data through  reverse  engineering  may  relieve  the  limitations.  The  life-cycle  savings  should clearly exceed the expected cost of acquiring data, or reverse engineering. 2.11.5.  Identifying, Selecting, and Screening Parts: 2.11.5.1.  Provisioned parts are subject to breakout. 2.11.5.1.1.  Throughout this breakout process, the AF should purchase items directly from the actual manufacturer whenever possible to avert added distributor and retailer costs. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 99 2.11.5.1.2.  Actual  screening  of  provisioned  parts  is  not  normally  practical  because the parts lack design stability. 2.11.5.2.  Generally, program managers need to periodically replenish provisioned parts. 2.11.5.2.1.  Managers  may  use  provisioning  lists  or  similar  lists  of  new  parts  for selecting parts for screening. 2.11.5.2.2.  Managers  base  screening  priorities  on  design  stability,  performance stability,  and  anticipated  replenishment.  They  also  consider  buy  values,  buy quantities, and the availability of technical data. 2.11.5.2.3.  Managers  should  make  efforts  to  fully  screen  parts  as  they  enter  the inventory. 2.11.5.2.3.1.  Parts should meet the above criteria. 2.11.5.2.3.2.  The  managing  activity  should  program  parts  for  replenishment procurement. 2.11.5.3.  AMCs  and  AMSCs  are  valid  until  the  next  assigned  review  date.  The  review may  vary  by  organization  and  part.  Coding  activities  may  assign  a  review  date  of  less than 5 years if available information indicates that no change in code is expected. 2.11.5.3.1.  Suspense dates may vary with the circumstances surrounding each part. 2.11.5.3.1.1.  AMSCs may receive suspense dates of: 24 months or less, 3 years, 5 years or 10 years. 2.11.5.3.1.2.  Items  with  a  1G  or  2G  code  do  not  require  a  suspense  date.  Management may dictate a periodic review of the parts assigned these codes. 2.11.5.3.2.  Program managers track the availability of data and the technical status of proposed actions to improve the competitive status until completion. 2.11.5.4.  When  an  activity  generates  a  buy  requirement  estimated  to  be  over  the screening threshold for a part without the current AMC or AMSC, the part is submitted for  screening  actions  according  to  either  the  full  or  limited  screening  procedures  IAW DFARS PGI 217.7506. 2.11.5.5.  Challenges to a suspect AMC/AMSC will be reviewed to verify the code. 2.11.5.6.  When events occur which may improve the competitive condition of a part and may result in recoding, management must conduct the screening and subsequent recoding promptly  without waiting for future procurement requests. Examples of actions that fall into this class are: 2.11.5.6.1.  Receipt of a technical data package. 2.11.5.6.2.  Release of proprietary rights. 2.11.5.6.3.  Completion of a reverse engineering project. 2.11.5.7.  Screening procedures for parts may vary depending on circumstances. No set of rules cover all conditions. Program managers may make an informed decision to breakout without  following  the  procedures  step-by-step  in  every  case.  They  should  do  the following in all cases: 100 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 2.11.5.7.1.  Obtain, consider, and record the necessary supporting facts. 2.11.5.7.2.  Involve  contractors  in  the  decision-making  process  only  to  the  extent  of providing technical information. 2.11.5.7.3.  Document any coding conferences with industry. 2.11.5.7.4.  Determine  through  screening  whether  a  part  is  suitable  for  competitive acquisition. 2.11.5.7.4.1.  It may be possible to break out the part for direct purchase from the actual manufacturer. 2.11.5.7.4.2.  Parts with  data belonging to the actual manufacturer and not likely to be procured by the government are particularly suited to direct purchase. Such direct  purchase  is  particularly  appropriate  if  the  manufacturer  assumes  total responsibility for the part, including its design, quality control, and testing. 2.11.5.7.5.  For  each  screened  part,  establish  a  file  to  document  and  justify  the decisions  and  results  of  all  screening  efforts.  Keep  this  file  on-hand  to  supply historical data for subsequent screening. 2.11.5.7.6.  After  a  part  gets  an  AMC  and  AMSC,  screening  does  not  cease.  The screening process continues as the AF receives documentation or contractor responses until  management  assigns  a  competitive  code  or  exhausts  all  efforts  to  improve  the code status. 2.11.5.7.7.  Before  completing  the  recoding  action,  the  responsible  engineering activity reviews and concurs with proposed changes to all screening packages. 2.11.6.  Reporting Instructions: 2.11.6.1.  The Spare Parts Breakout Screening Report (RCS DD P&L [QS&A] 714A) is a cumulative semiannual report detailing the accomplishments of the breakout program. The report describes full and limited screening for provisioning and replenishment parts by the number of different NSN for each AMC. 2.11.6.2.  The  Spare  Parts  Acquisition  Report  (RCS:  DD  P&K  [QS&A]  714B)  is  a cumulative  semiannual  report  documenting  all  spare  part  purchases  during  the  current fiscal year. The report describes the number and extended-dollar value of different NSNs purchased for each AMC. 2.11.6.3.  The  AF  maintains  actual  cost-savings  (or  cost  avoidance)  data  attributable  to the AFSPBP and include the data in the semiannual Spare Parts Acquisition Report. 2.11.6.4.  The  AF  purchases  reported  in  the  Spare  Parts  Acquisition  Report  may  not match the screenings reported in the Spare Parts Breakout Screening Report  because of time differences between screenings and actual purchases and procurement lead-times. 2.11.6.5.  The  AFSPBP  Costs  required  for  the  Spare  Parts  Breakout  Screening  Report come  from  the  SH069-LO3,  RC  Managers  Cost  Center  Report.  Activities  should  use EEIC  392,  Other  Civilian  Personnel  Compensation,  Gross  Obligation  to  reflect  their costs. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 101 2.11.6.6.  Reports  are  due  to  AF/A4LR  30  days  after  the  end  of  each  reporting  period (October through March and April through September). 2.11.6.7.  Correct and revise the midyear reports in the year-end reports. Year-end reports may not be revised. Section 2L—Tanks, Racks, Adapters, and Pylons (TRAP) 2.12.

WRM  TRAP  requirements  will  be  determined  annually  through  a  year-long process  that begins  with the MWG. Attendees will include various representatives from Air Staff, AFMC TRAP Activity, applicable sustainment depots, the combat MAJCOMs, and other key personnel. 2.12.4.2.  The latest  theater war plans, force structure documents, operational,  and other pertinent inputs will be reviewed at the TWG meeting(s) to develop and determine WRM TRAP requirements. 2.12.4.3.  Modeling,  war  plan  review,  current  and  projected  force  structure  review,  and manual inputs will be used to develop viable, defendable WRM TRAP requirements. 2.12.4.4.  WRM  TRAP  requirements  will  be  published  in  the  NCAA.  The  NCAA provides  near  term  (budget  year)  WRM  requirements;  out  year  (6  years  hence)  WRM TRAP requirements; TRAP Inventory Objectives (IO); and midterm TRAP requirements. 2.12.4.4.1.  Budget  year  requirements  will  be  considered  in  determining  near  term stockage levels. 2.12.4.4.2.  The  out  year  WRM  requirement  is  based  on  projected  inventories  of TRAP  items  and  supported  munitions;  it  is  the  basis  for  determining  excesses  for demilitarization, foreign military sales, etc., when compared to IOs. 2.12.4.4.3.  The  out  year  TRAP  IO  supports  an  optimum  mix  of  existing  and developing  weapons  and is  used as a basis for procurement decisions. The  IOs may be less than the sum of MAJCOM-identified WRM TRAP requirement. 2.12.4.4.4.  The midterm WRM TRAP requirements will be used for continuing trend analysis. 2.12.4.5.  WRM TRAP item apportionment will be computed in the NCAA and identified as theater starter objectives. 2.12.4.6.  TRAP requirements will be forwarded to the AFMC TRAP Activity and TRAP IMs.  TRAP  requirements  will  be  file  maintained  and  implemented  in  the  applicable AFMC materiel management IT system’s instructions for scheduling TRAP depot repair actions. These coordinated instructions, along with the current near and out year NCAA TRAP requirements, will be transmitted to each applicable AFMC Air Logistics Complex for review. 104 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 Chapter 3 SOURCING OF MATERIEL Section 3A—Overview 3.1.

Individual  basis  of training  equipment requirements  will  not  be  cited  in  allowance  standards  due  to  variation  in  student loads, duration of courses and other variable factors which preclude identity of fixed allowances. The only exceptions to this policy are nuclear weapons-related equipment cited in AS 805 (Nuclear Weapons Training), weapons-related equipment cited in AS 538ACFB (AETC  Students/Deployers  Requiring  Weapons  Training),  and COMSEC/CCI equipment (Serialized Report Code “C”). 5.4.3.17.2.  A single organization and shop code will be established for each course or FTD weapon system Mission Design Series (MDS) Training units with equipment in multiple  locations  may  have  multiple  equipment  accounts.  The  unit’s  organization identification code (Org ID) will be consolidated at the appropriate level  (i.e., wing, group, squadron) and will be assigned by HQ AETC/A4R 5.4.3.17.2.1.  The  equipment  custodian  will  provide  a  single  AETC  Form  120, Training  Equipment  List,  or  AETC  Form  120A,  Field  Training  Equipment  List, for  each  course  or  MDS.  (T-2).  The  AETC  Form  120/120A  is  utilized  as  the allowance  standard  for  the  course  or  FTD.  Custodians  will  list  items  in  stock number sequence and indicate maximum authorizations. (T-2). 5.4.3.17.2.2.  A  new  AETC  Form  120/120A  will  be  provided  whenever  the custodian  requests  authorization  changes,  additions,  or  deletions.  The  AETC Form  120/120A  must the Organizational/Detachment  Commander,  Director,  or  Flight  Chief.  The  letter must  indicate  any  required  authorization  changes  and  identify  any  quantity  that supply  must  order.  The  letter  and  AETC  Form  120/120A  will  be  kept  in  the Master Jacket File and the Custodian Jacket File. The new AETC Form 120/120A and signed cover letter will replace superseded forms and letters in both files. signed  by accompany a cover letter 5.4.3.17.3.  The  LRS EAE will cite the AS  of the functional  area or  weapon system followed by alpha “O” (e.g., 734OOOO). 5.4.3.17.4.  Equipment authorizations on the AETC Form 120/120A will be validated annually by the custodian. (T-2). 5.4.3.17.5.  Seized  Equipment  Search  and  seizure  is  an  investigative  technique  used by law enforcement to gather evidence pertaining to an investigation. Procedures for seized equipment are IAW 23-122 Chap 5 Sec. 5D. 5.4.4.  Allowance Standards-Issue and Control. 5.4.4.1.  Basis of Issue (BOI). The BOI in allowance standards is normally the maximum quantity  for  nonexpendable  items  which  may  be  authorized.  BOI  for  funded  (BC  9) Equipment  are  advisory  only  and  are  not  restricted  to  the  identified  users.  Note:  The commander/designated  representative  are  authorized  to  exceed  the  BOI  in  weapons AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 145 system  support  allowance  standards  if  the  prime  authorization  is  base  funded  (BC  9). Base funds cannot be used to procure alpha budget coded items. 5.4.4.2.  Allowance Standard Items. Allowance standards normally list the master item in the  ISG.  All  prime authorization records will reflect  the stock number prescribed in  the allowance  standard.  A  prime  NSN  will  not  be  substituted  for  another  prime.  If  another prime meets your requirement, submit a change request. 5.4.4.3.

Planning and conducting inventories. 5.7.4.1.  Establishing  an  inventory  schedule.  Within  the  LRS,  the  Inventory  Section  or equivalent  in  other  materiel  management  activities  will  establish  an  inventory  schedule by fiscal year to ensure all items assigned a warehouse location and/or on a detail record (to  include  IPE)  are  inventoried  at  the  designated  frequency.  The  warehouse  validation schedule will follow the inventory schedule for type stock record account codes B and E, and  satellites.  Out-of-cycle  inventory  counts  will  not  satisfy  quarterly,  semiannual,  or annual  complete  inventory  requirements.  The  LRS  CC/AO  has  the  authority  to  conduct inventories more frequently for assets on their accountable record. 5.7.4.2.  Closed  warehouse  inventory.  A  closed  warehouse  inventory  is  the  normal method  for  conducting  inventories.

Ensure all transactions affecting locations have  been  pulled  or  put-away  prior  to  a  physical  count.  Emergency  issues  will  be processed  as  degraded  operations  transactions  and  will  be  recorded  on  the  inventory recap sheet. The materiel management officer will ensure the warehouse does not remain closed  to  normal  receipts  and  issues  for  an  unreasonable  length  of  time  and  is immediately reopened after completion of the count. 5.7.4.3.  Inventory types. Only two types of inventory counts are authorized to ensure the accuracy  of  base  materiel  inventory  records.  They  are  complete  counts  and  special counts. Complete inventories will only be taken by the closed warehouse method. 5.7.4.3.1.  Complete  Inventory  Counts.  Complete  inventory  counts  are  designed  for conducting  Complete  inventory  counts  are  conducted  using  the  closed  warehouse-method of inventory. This method applies to all stock record account codes, satellites, and  custodial  accounts.

Automatic Inventory adjustment guidance. 5.7.9.1.  The  dollar  value  for  automatic  inventory  adjustment,  computed  by  multiplying the adjusted quantity by the unit price, is within the following limits: 5.7.9.1.1.  Pilferable items less than $100.00. 5.7.9.1.2.  Controlled  item  code  U,  unclassified  items  less  than  $1,000.00.  Note: Items  with  controlled  item  code  7,  although  considered  unclassified  for  storage  and handling  purposes,  require  research  prior  to  adjustment.  The  loss,  theft,  unlawful disposition,  and/or  recovery  of  an  item  in  this  category  will  be  investigated  IAW DLM 4000.25-2 and DoD 7200.10-M. (T-0). 5.7.10.  Inventory Research. The objective of inventory research is to identify causes for out of  balance  conditions.  Specific  types  of  errors  can  include  errors  in  inventory  counts, transaction processing, and transactions that may not have been posted to the recap sheet. As a minimum the following research will be conducted: 5.7.10.1.  Post  count  validation  will  be  done  for  all  out  of  balance  discrepancies.  Post count  validation  is  a  comparison  of  physical  count  to  recorded  balances  with consideration  for  transactions  that  have  occurred  since  the  date  of  last  inventory.  Post count  validation  research  ends  when  the  accuracy  of  the  original  inventory  count  has been verified or when any necessary recounts have been taken. 5.7.10.2.  Pre-adjustment  research  will  occur  on  all  adjustments  that  do  not  meet automatic  adjustment  criteria  IAW  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5.  Pre-adjustment research  is  a  review  of  potential  discrepancies,  which  involves  the  review  of  all transactions  to  include  supporting  documentation:  catalog  change  actions,  shipment discrepancies,  and  un-posted  or  rejected  documentation  occurring  since  the  last completed inventory; the last location reconciliation which included quantity; or back one year  whichever  is  sooner.  The  purpose  of  pre-adjustment  research  is  to  determine  the correct balance. Pre-adjustment research ends when the balance has been verified or the required adjustment quantity has been determined. 5.7.10.2.1.  For  Unclassified  and  Pilferable  assets,  the  maximum  time  to  complete pre-adjustment research is 7 calendar days. 5.7.10.2.2.  For  NWRM,  Sensitive  and  Classified  assets,  the  maximum  time  to complete pre-adjustment research is 5 calendar days. 5.7.10.3.  Causative  research  will  be  accomplished  for  all  pilferable  items  valued  over $100,  all  other  controlled  items,  DIFMs,  and  adjustments  greater  than  $1,000.  The purpose  of  causative  research  is  to  identify,  analyze,  and  evaluate  the  root  cause  of inventory discrepancies with the aim of eliminating repetitive errors. Causative research  ends  when  the  cause  of  the  discrepancy  has  been  discovered  or  when,  after  a  thorough review of the transactions, no conclusive findings are possible. 5.7.11.  Inventory  Analysis.  An  analysis  will  be  made  of  inventory  adjustments  that  have been  processed  and  potential  variances  resolved.  Analysis  can  reveal  trends  that  can  be  a valuable  tool  toward  gaining  effective  asset  control  by  identifying  areas  of  current  and AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 161 potential  high  loss.  Inventory  Analysis  will  be  performed  monthly  to  accomplish  the following: 5.7.11.1.  To identify failures in the control systems so improvements can be made. 5.7.11.2.  To reduce similar discrepancies in the future. 5.7.11.3.  To evaluate indicators of trends or system problems for corrective action. 5.7.11.4.  To  ensure  that  the  proper  inventory  adjustment  and  proper  controls  were asserted. 5.7.11.4.1.  For  inventory  adjustment  of  AF  items  with  a  Security  Classification,  to ensure  actions  required  for  Threat  Reduction/Controlled  Material  items  were followed.  See  AFMAN  23-122,  Sec.  5G,  Physical  Inventory  and  Inventory Adjustments for appropriate procedures. 5.7.11.5.  For  areas  with  a  high  rate  of  inventory  adjustments,  extra  controls  will  be instituted selectively by the LRS CC/AO or equivalent. These controls will include: 5.7.11.5.1.  Additional  research  to  identify  systems/operational  deficiencies  causing an inventory adjustment, high loss items and possible pilferage. 5.7.11.5.2.  Initiation of a report of survey. 5.7.11.5.3.  Disciplinary action as required. 5.7.11.5.4.  Establishment of studies and action items to correct deficiencies. 5.7.11.5.5.  Elevation  of  levels  authorized  to  review,  certify  and  approve  inventory adjustments. 5.7.11.5.6.  Referral  of  systems  problems  to  higher  echelons  with  recommended solutions. 5.7.11.5.7.  Follow-on actions of analysis. Section 5H—Special Purpose Recoverables Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM) 5.8.  Special Purpose Recoverables Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM). 5.8.1.  SPRAM  assets  are  ERRCD  code  XD/XF  items  used  by  maintenance  to  perform functions  such  as  detecting  or  isolating  a  fault,  calibrating  or  aligning  equipment,  and duplicating an active system  installed in  an aircraft or on-line equipment. SPRAM includes items  listed  in  the  -21  TO’s  and  are  used  to  conduct  approved  Air  Education  and  Training Command (AETC) training courses. 5.8.1.1.  This  section  is  applicable  to  AF  activities  providing  or  employing  SPRAM.  Note:  The  exclusion  of  -21  TO  items  in  the  SPRAM  program  is  optional  when  the owning MAJCOM is using other methods to  maintain accountability and  visibility. The owning MAJCOM has to provide the central IM an annual update of asset position. 5.8.2.  SPRAM management. SPRAM assets are managed on detail records accounted for by LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity. This  ensures additional SPRAM assets  are procured if requirements  exceed  asset  availability.  Recoverable  assets  accounted  for  by  a  different 162 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 method, such as supply points, do not require transfer to SPRAM details. SPRAM flag is a code used to identify the types of requirements authorized for retention of SPRAM assets. 5.8.3.  Responsibilities. 5.8.3.1.  MAJCOMs. 5.8.3.1.1.  All  SPRAM requirements will be  forwarded to  the MAJCOM CEMO for submission to the MAJCOM FAM. MAJCOM CEMO will forward request approved by  the  MAJCOM  FAM  to  the  Lead  Command  FAM  for  final  approval  with  a statement  of  unit/MAJCOM  funding  availability  for  the  requested  items.  Once MAJCOM  receives  Lead  Command  FAM  approval  with  supporting  documentation, the MAJCOM CEMO will forward a copy of approval documentation and notify the supported activity to requisition the asset. 5.8.3.1.2.  SPRAM  Requirements  for  aircraft  maintenance/Cost  per  Flying  Hour (CPFH) programs, replacement, and replenishment will be funded by the appropriate Funds Holder. The Centralized Asset Management (CAM) office is the Funds Holder for  most  active  duty  CPFH  programs  (excludes  Air  Mobility  Command  (AMC) strategic  airlift  and  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Command  (AFSOC).  The  Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve Command, AFSOC and AMC (C-5 and C-17) are responsible  for  their  individual  SPRAM/Flying  Programs.  All  other  (i.e.,  non-flying hour)  replacement/replenishment  SPRAM  requirements  will  be  paid  for  by  the owning MAJCOM or using organization. MSD charges Exchange Price if a carcass is returned, otherwise the Standard Price will be charged. 5.8.3.1.3.  Exceptions. 5.8.3.1.3.1.  XF3  items  are  not  on  SPRAM  details  unless  MAJCOM  or  a  higher authority so directs for a specific program. 5.8.3.1.3.2.  Recoverable  assets  accounted  for  by  a  different  method,  such  as supply point, do not require transfer to SPRAM details. 5.8.3.1.3.3.  SPRAM  assets  may  satisfy  MICAP requirements.  SPRAM requirements  will  not  be  misused  as  a  means  to  routinely  fill  MICAP requirements. 5.8.3.2.  AFMC will: 5.8.3.2.1.  Identify/select SPRAM items during the provisioning process. 5.8.3.2.2.  Provide  MAJCOMs  SPRAM  requirements provisioning identified  during initial 5.8.3.2.3.  Consider SPRAM requirements in buy computations. PM/EAIM approval is required for SPRAM authorizations. 5.8.3.3.

Reviews  and  certifies  as  the  approval  authority,  all  requests  for  SPRAM authorizations submitted by SPRAM custodians. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 163 5.8.3.3.2.  Ensures all SPRAM assets are properly maintained and safeguarded. Note: These  actions  may  be  delegated  by  the  Group/CC  to  the  Squadron  Commander/ Designated Representative. Delegation below that level is not authorized. 5.8.3.4.  Organization Commander/Designated Representative. 5.8.3.4.1.  Ensures  all  mission-essential  SPRAM  assets  are  on-hand  or  on-order  to support  the  assigned  or  programmed  functions  and  unit  mission.  Annually,  certifies by signing the SPRAM listing all authorizations are current and necessary for mission support.  This  will  be  done  in  conjunction  with  the  annual  inventory  or  upon assumption of the account. 5.8.3.4.2.  Appoints  capable  individuals  as  SPRAM  custodians  and  alternates, including  establishment,  change,  or  cancellation  of  SPRAM  accounts.  Custodians may be commissioned officers, noncommissioned officers, civilians or contractors (as specified  in  contract),  and  must  be  mutually  agreed  upon  by  the  organization commander. This applies to active duty AF and Reserve personnel. Foreign nationals or local wage rate employees (foreign nationals in host countries) may be appointed as  primary  or  alternate  SPRAM  custodians  only  when  they  may  be  held  pecuniary liable  under  the  laws  of  the  host  country.  A  new  primary  custodian  or  alternate  is appointed  when  both the  primary  and  alternate  custodian  will  be  absent simultaneously for 45 or more calendar days, or when either custodian is reassigned or separated. 5.8.3.4.2.1.  Ensures  primary  and  alternate  SPRAM  custodians,  not  previously trained, attend block training courses provided by the LRS CC/AO. 5.8.3.4.2.2.  Ensures  primary  and  alternate  SPRAM  custodians  receive  within every 2 years refresher block training courses provided by the LRS CC/AO. 5.8.3.4.2.3.  Ensures  qualified  individuals  are  preselected  as  SPRAM  custodians on  all  unit  deployments.  Individuals  identified  to  the  host  LRS  CC/AO  receive training regarding management of SPRAM assets during deployment. 5.8.3.4.2.4.  Ensures personnel are aware of policies and guidelines established in AFI 23-111 and AFI 20-110. 5.8.3.5.  Primary and Alternate SPRAM Custodian. 5.8.3.5.1.  Upon  assignment  and  every  two  years  thereafter  as  a  custodian,  attend training on responsibilities, current policies, and procedures with EAE. 5.8.3.5.2.  Performs initial, annual and periodic inventories of SPRAM assets. 5.8.3.5.2.1.  Periodic inventories and validations occur when there is a change of primary  custodian,  when  requested  by  the  Organization  Commander/designated representative or higher authority, or when directed by MAJCOM. 5.8.3.5.2.2.  Ensures that all items are on-hand and serviceable. 5.8.3.5.2.3.  Validate SPRAM authorizations and backorders. Turn-in  excess  and request cancellation of unneeded backorders and requisitions. 164 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 5.8.3.5.3.  Concurrent  with  annual  inventory,  specifically  determine  whether  the original justification is still valid and annotate the annual validation accordingly. If a change in mission and/or number of end items supported has occurred since the last validation,  custodians  must  provide  rationale  if  there  is  no  corresponding  change  in authorizations. 5.8.3.5.3.1.  Provides  SPRAM  listing  to  organizational  commander/designated representative  for  their  certification  and  signature  that  authorizations  are  current and necessary for mission support. 5.8.3.5.3.2.  Maintain  justification  documentation  for  all  SPRAM  authorizations until the authorization is deleted. 5.8.3.5.3.3.  Reports  at  once,  any  incorrect  authorizations  and  excess  on-hand assets to the EAE. 5.8.3.5.4.  Verifies  the  SPRAM  listing  received  from  the  EAE  to  ensure  data  are complete  and  accurate.  Signs  and  returns  the  SPRAM  listing  to  EAE  within  15 workdays from the production date on the SPRAM listing (off-base organizations are allowed 30 workdays). 5.8.3.5.5.  Furnishes  all  information  and  documentation  required  to  change  SPRAM records  to  be  relieved  from  accountability  or  responsibility  for  items  lost  or destroyed. 5.8.3.5.6.  Makes  sure  the  custody  account  has  been  properly  transferred  to  the  new custodian when responsibility ends, and the custodian is cleared by EAE. 5.8.3.5.7.  Provides  justification  to  EAE  citing  supporting  documentation  when requesting  new  or  increased  SPRAM  authorizations.  Supporting  documentation includes  TO  references,  maintenance  directives,  correspondence,  etc.  PM/EAIM approval  is  required  for  SPRAM  authorizations.  Also,  the  EAIM  may  challenge requests for suspect excess quantities. 5.8.3.5.7.1.  The  methodology  for  computing  the  SPRAM  quantity  will  be included  in  the  justification.  For  example,  a  maintenance  directive  states  a quantity  of  two  SPRAM  assets  are  required  per  aircraft  and  24  aircraft  are assigned  to  the  organization.  The  SPRAM  quantity  authorized  under  this justification would be 48 each. 5.8.3.5.8.  Performs  a  due-out  validation  with  the  EAE  in  the  LRS/Materiel Management Activity. 5.8.3.5.9.  Establishes  an  accounting  method  or  system  that  allows  immediate identification  of  SPRAM  assets  stored  or  used  outside  the  custodian's  workcenter. This may be done by using hand receipts (AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt), logs, letters, charts, etc. and is normally documented in a local MOI. 5.8.3.5.10.  Provide EAE a listing of all SPRAM assets to be transferred or deployed indicating  the  duration,  location,  and  any  special  actions  required.  The  custodian determines if any requirements on order at the time of transfer action will remain on order or be cancelled. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 165 5.8.3.6.  The EAE or equivalent is responsible for SPRAM processes. EAEs will: 5.8.3.6.1.  Report SPRAM authorizations and balances in the appropriate APSR. This data is reported as changes occur to SPRAM asset levels or when other changes occur to the applicable NSN. (T-2). 5.8.3.6.2.  Maintain  a  copy  of  each to  SPRAM authorizations  in  a  folder  along  with  the  current  SPRAM  listing  and  the  custodian appointment  letter.  (T-2).  Letters  may  be  destroyed  when  a  new  SPRAM  listing signed by the SPRAM custodian is received. letter  requesting  changes 5.8.3.6.3.  Review  all  SPRAM  authorizations  annually  and  certify  them  as  valid. Certification  may  occur  during  the  annual  SPRAM  inventory  and  may  be  noted  on the approved SPRAM listing. (T-2). 5.8.3.6.4.  Maintain SPRAM Custodian Files. (T-2). 5.8.3.6.5.  Review justification for SPRAM authorizations concurrent with the annual inventory. (T-2). 5.8.3.6.5.1.  Specifically  determine  whether  the  original  justifications  are  still valid and validate annually. (T-2). 5.8.3.6.5.2.  Delete  invalid  SPRAM  authorizations,  turn  in  excesses  and  cancel unneeded requisitions. (T-2). 5.8.3.6.5.3.  Maintain  justification  documentation  for  all  SPRAM  authorizations until the authorization is deleted. (T-2). Section 5I—Inspection and Related Operations 5.9.  Inspection Operations and Related Operations. 5.9.1.

Shelf-Life  Coded  Items.  Shelf-life  codes  are  established  in  the  retail  materiel management system to identify the number of months new items may remain unused in storage before they must be reconditioned or condemned. Note: The shelf-life code does not identify the shelf-life remaining on any particular unit(s) of on-hand stock. Shelf-Life coded items are managed and stored IAW the policies contained in DoD 4140.27-M. 5.9.9.2.1.  Controlling  Items  in  Storage.  To  control  items  in  storage,  Inspection personnel  will  at  least  quarterly  process  a  listing  of  the  item  records  for  all  items assigned  shelf-life  codes.  Refer  to  AFMAN  23-122,  Sec.  5C,  Physical  Asset Management for shelf-life procedures. (T-1). 5.9.9.3.  For guidance on TCTOs refer to Sec. 4B, TCTO of this instruction. 5.9.9.4.  Identification of Discrepant Material. To ensure the right items are identified as unsuitable for AF use. Inspection personnel will notify base customers via daily bulletins, AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 169 newsletters  or  phone  calls  as  a  means  of  notification.  (T-2).  The  basis  for  notification depends  upon  the  type  of  item,  i.e.  messages  concerning  items  peculiar  to  one organization will not be published in daily bulletins or newsletters. 5.9.9.4.1.  Suspect  Materiel  Flag.  Upon  notification  and  subsequent  identification  of an unsuitable item, Inspection personnel will process a stock control data load input; see  AFMAN  23-122,  Sec.  5C,  Physical  Asset  Management,  for  processing information.  The  length  of  time  an  item  will  be  coded  as  suspect  materiel  will  be published in the applicable directives. If not, the code will remain on the item record for one year. 5.9.9.4.1.1.  When suspect materiel is received or turned-in, Inspection personnel determine  if  the  materiel  is  unsuitable  or  not  and  dispose  of  unsuitable  items according to the disposition instructions provided in the applicable directive. They return  suitable  items  to  a  serviceable  condition  IAW  AFMAN  23-122,  Sec.  5C, Physical  Asset  Management.  If  disposition  instructions  must  be  obtained,  the inspector notes the corrective actions to be taken and signs/stamps and routes the management notice IAW AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5C, Physical Asset Management. 5.9.9.4.2.  Disposition. Remove on-hand unsuitable items from storage locations and dispose of them according to the disposition  instructions furnished in  the applicable directive.  When  disposition  instructions  have  not  been  provided,  process  a  stock control data load input to change the condition of the assets to supply condition code J. This will suspend the items on an unserviceable detail until disposition instructions can be obtained. 5.9.9.4.3.  Materiel  Suspect  Code  Listing.  Each  month  Inspection  personnel  must request  a  utility  program  to  list  all  stock  numbers  having  materiel  suspect  codes assigned  to  them.  (T-2).  Inspection  forwards  one  copy  of  the  listing  to  Distribution Flight  and  another  copy  to  Flight  Service  Center,  who  in-turn  uses  them  during Degraded  Operations.  Inspection  personnel  maintain  a  working  copy  until  a  new monthly listing is printed. 5.9.9.5.  Supply  Discrepancy  Report.  The  Report  of  Discrepancy  (ROD)/Supply Discrepancy Report, SF 364, is filed by receiving activities to record item or packaging discrepancies attributable to the shipping activity see DLM 4000.25, Vol 2, Chapter 17. SDRs  are  prepared  for  non-receipt  of  lost  or  misplaced  requisitions  (shipments)  after Cargo  Movement  or  equivalent  confirms  non-receipt  of  lost  or  misplaced  requisitions (shipments). Use the Enterprise Solution-Supply (ES-S) SDR function or the DoD Web-SDR  system  as  the  primary  means  to  submit  SDRs  and  SF  364  when  the  ES-S  SDR function  or  the  DoD  Web-SDR  system  is  not  available.  Corrective  action  will  be  taken depending on the source/nature of any discrepancy, and will involve proper identification and  condition  of  materiel.  Any  subsequent  action  taken  will  be  determined  only  by qualified and authorized inspectors. 5.9.9.5.1.  Customer  Support  Liaison  Element  must  coordinate  with  the  receiving activity to ensure all SDRs are identified. (T-2) 5.9.9.5.2.  Replies to SDR. 5.9.9.5.2.1.

Warranted or Guaranteed Items Requiring Repair. Normally, organizations will  process  warranted  or  guaranteed  items  requiring  repair  directly  to  Contract Maintenance.  For  exceptions  to  this  guidance,  either  the  AFMC  IM  or  the  ICP  will provide instructions for processing the item or FSC involved. 5.9.9.6.4.  Supply  Inspectors  normally  manage  the  functional  check  program  for  the LRS/AO.  At  the  option  of  the  LRS  CC/AO  or  the  MAJCOM,  the  functional  check program for RSPs may be managed separately. The LRS CC/AO and the AMXS and MXS/CC  of  Maintenance  will  jointly  agree  on  an  individual  to  act  as  the Maintenance contact point. (T-3). 5.9.9.7.  Items  in  MRSPs.  When  the  MAJCOM  or  LRS  CC/AO  has  not  directed otherwise, APS personnel will review dated items in MRSP using the Shelf-Life Control Listing. The MAJCOM or local management may direct Inspection personnel to perform this task using the Shelf-Life Control Listing provided by the MRSP monitor. 5.9.9.8.  Processing Condemned Items. Condemned items will be processed according to AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5I, Inspection and Related Operations. (T-2). 5.9.9.9.  Special  Storage,  Handling,  and  Inspection  Requirements.  There  are  numerous categories  of  items  and  circumstances  where  alternate  or  additional  procedures  for storage, handling, and inspection are required. Examples include: Controlled items, items requiring  functional  check  prior  to  issue,  hazardous  commodities,  shelf-life  control, assets  pending  modification,  and  items  that  may  have  a  warranty/guaranty  associated AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 171 with  them.  See  AFMAN  23-122,  Sec.  5C  Physical  Asset  Management  for  detailed procedures  required  to  manage  assets  that  require  special  storage,  handling,  and inspection requirements. 5.9.9.10.  Special Inspection Requirements. 5.9.9.10.1.  Inspection  Offline  Checklist.  Inspection  personnel  maintain  a  file/list  of items unsuitable for AF use (suspect materiel), functional checks, and TCTOs that are not loaded during the initial screening. Items must remain in the file/list at least 1 year or  sooner  if  the  situation  or  condition  affecting  the  item  has  been  resolved  or rescinded. 5.9.9.10.2.  Monthly,  Inspection  personnel  will  use  a  local  management  program  to determine if any items have been subsequently loaded. When any of the items in the file/list  are  loaded,  Inspection  must  then  take  the  action  required  by  the  appropriate directives and ensure the correct codes are loaded. (T-2) 5.9.9.11.  Tagging Requirements for Materiel Directly Affected by TCTO. 5.9.9.11.1.  Applicable to the AFMC Air Logistics Complexes. 5.9.9.11.1.1.  Materiel  spares  in  stock  with  outstanding  TCTO  requirements  will be  tagged  TO  compliance  (TOC),  condition  code  "D"  with  a  DD  Form 1576/1576-1, Test Modification Tag - Materiel upon receipt of the TCTO except when the TCTO will change the item's form/fit/function (change in NSN and part number), or when specific serial number controlled items are affected. In the case of  serial  number  controlled  items,  only  the  serial  numbers  identified  will  be tagged TOC. 5.9.9.11.1.2.  There  are  instances  when  only  a  portion  of  the  existing  stock  may require  TOC  action.  All  units  in  stock  will  be  tagged  TOC  upon  receipt  of  the TCTO. The IM will treat these items as management review items. 5.9.9.11.1.3.  When serviceable materiel with no outstanding TCTOs is turned in from  organizational/intermediate  or  depot  level  maintenance  to  supply,  the serviceable  tag/label  (DD  Form  1574/1574-1)  will  be  annotated  with  the following  phrase  in  the  remarks  block:  "The  following  TCTOs  have  been complied with: (list all TCTO numbers in the remarks block and/or on the back of the  tag)."  The  annotation  is  not  required  whenever  the  item  being  returned  has undergone TOC action involving modification and resulted in a change in NSN or part number. Material being turned in to supply with an outstanding TCTO(s) will be  tagged  with  a  DD  Form  1576/1576-1  tag  or  label  as  condition  code  "D" (TOC), and the phrase "TCTO (numbers(s)) not complied with" will be annotated in the remarks block. 5.9.9.11.1.4.  Material  in  a  condition  other  than  serviceable  will  not  require tagging  as  TOC.  The  maintenance  activity  will  determine  outstanding  TCTO requirements at the time of repair. 5.9.9.11.2.  Applicable to AF bases. Items requiring modifications which change their form,  fit,  or  function  will  be  assigned  NPPC  4  or  TCTO  flag  with  DD  Form 1576/1576-1. 172 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 Section 5J—Management of Discrepant, Counterfeit and Suspect Counterfeit Materiel 5.10.

Stock  positioning  decisions  will  be  based primarily on achieving responsive and efficient materiel distribution support. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 177 5.11.2.  AF  stock  positioning  policies  will  comply  with  requirements  in  DoDM  4140.01; DLM  4000.25-M;  DLM  4000.25-1-M;  DLM  4000.25-2,  Military  Standard  Transaction Reporting  And  Accountability  Procedures  (MILSTRAP);  DoD  4140.26-M;  DoDM4140.68; AFPD 23-1; AFI 20-110; and AFJMAN 23-210. 5.11.3.  Automatic  Sourcing.  Automatic  Sourcing  will  enable  a  capability  to:  1)  automate lateral  (base  to  base)  support  for  high  priority  orders  (HPOs)  and;  2)  automatically redistribute excess assets. 5.11.3.1.  The  Automatic  Lateral  Support  function  supports  MICAP,  AWP,  JCS,  and/or FSL requirements. 5.11.3.2.  The  Excess  Redistribution  function  automatically  screens  outgoing  lower priority requisitions for assets to determine if redistributable excess assets are available at other  materiel  management  IT  system  accounts  before  forwarding  the  requisition  to  the normal source of supply. 5.11.3.3.  The  Air  Force’s  policy  is  to  laterally  distribute  serviceable  assets  from  the location  that  has  the  least  need  for  the  requested  item  in  order  to  minimize  subsequent resupply  actions  (by  the  shipping  location)  and  to  ensure  that  any  subsequent  re-supply actions  (requisitions)  will  not  have  a  higher  priority  than  the  requisition  being  released. The  overall  distribution  sequence  is  described  in  Enterprise  Solution-Supply  (ESS) manual. 5.11.4.  Roles and responsibilities. 5.11.4.1.  Delegation of Authority. Reference Chapter 1. 5.11.4.2.  AFMC will: 5.11.4.2.1.  Direct the reallocation and redistribution of AF-owned materiel to ensure that  the  right  inventory  is  at  the  right  locations  to  meet  customer  requirements  by making  best  value  decisions  on  where  to  position  stocks.  Note:  The  Global Ammunitions  Control  Point  directs  the  reallocation  and  redistribution  of  AF-owned Class V materiel IAW AFI 21-201. 5.11.4.2.2.  In  coordination  with  DLA  (if  applicable),  determine  where  stock  listed assets are stored unless contingency operations dictate otherwise. 5.11.4.2.3.  Maintain  oversight  of  Industrial  Plant  Equipment  (IPE)  required  for support  of  AF  military  organizations.  Whereas,  the  IPE  Services  Division  under DLA’s  Aviation  Engineering  Directorate  maintains  full  inventory  control  of  DoD owned IPE IAW DLAM 4215.1. 5.11.4.2.4.  Position assets close to users resulting in improved responsiveness, better support  of  peace  and  wartime  requirements  and  reduced  distribution  costs.  This guidance  is  applicable  to  all  wholesale  secondary  items  stocked  by  the  AF,  except war  reserves  and  stocks  designated  for  specific  projects.  The  impact  on  inventory levels and the associated costs are an important part of the determination process. 5.11.4.2.5.  Restrict single point stockage of items to those that are supported by cost and benefit analysis. 178 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 5.11.4.2.6.  Make  arrangements  for,  and  the  coordination  of  intra-AF  or  interservice support between the affected activities. 5.11.4.2.7.  In  collaboration  with  DLA,  provide  final  authority  on  all  proposed agreements involving AF assets/storage sites. 5.11.5.  LRS/Materiel Management Activity 5.11.5.1.  Customer  Service  will  monitor  the  results  of  automatic  sourcing.  Rejects associated  with  the  A2A/A21/SHP  need  to  be  researched  and  not  just  “clear  carded”  to ensure the accurate response to requisitioning of another account. (T-2). Section 5L—Materiel Disposition 5.12.  Materiel Disposition. 5.12.1.  Roles and Responsibilities: 5.12.1.1.  AF/A4: 5.12.1.1.1.  Delegation of Authority. Reference Chapter 1. 5.12.1.2.  AFMC. AFMC shall: 5.12.1.2.1.  Provide guidance for AF reclamation processes. 5.12.1.2.2.  Provide  guidance  for  removal  of  parts  at  AFMC  Maintenance  and Regeneration Activity, including those to support retail-level MICAP requisitions and urgent  depot  support  requirement,  along  with  the  associated  mini-save  list(s) development. 5.12.1.2.3.  Direct IM responsibilities as identified in this section. 5.12.1.2.4.  Monitor formal disposal freeze notices, revisions, or cancellations within AFMC materiel management operations. 5.12.1.2.5.  Through its IMs, will: 5.12.1.2.5.1.  Initiate reclamation actions for AF-managed stock numbers and part numbers. 5.12.1.2.5.2.  Use  reclamation  in  place  of  procurement  or  repair  to  obtain components  whenever  it  will  result  in  measurable  savings.  It  will  also  be  used whenever it will provide the fastest means of satisfying a critical  requirement or when there is no other known SOS, regardless of savings. 5.12.1.2.5.3.  Will determine requirements for parts when end items or assemblies become available for reclamation. 5.12.1.2.5.4.  Initiate  reclamation  requests  for  items  capable  of  being  reclaimed economically or not available from other sources. 5.12.1.2.5.5.  Authorize changes/additions/deletions to save lists. 5.12.1.2.5.6.  Review and evaluate existing disposal freezes once a year before the annual retention computation. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 179 5.12.1.2.5.7.  Justify  in  writing  equipment  retention  additive  requirements  to  a subgroup  master  stock  number  in  the  requirements  data  system  and  review retention  additives  to  ensure  they  are  deleted  once  they  serve  their  legitimate purpose. 5.12.2.  Reclamation. 5.12.2.1.  The  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  Reclamation  Program  is  prescribed  by DoDM 4140.01 and implemented by DoD 4160.21-M, Chapter 13, Reclamation. 5.12.2.2.  The authority for reclamation of aircraft is AFI 16-402. Disposal of aircraft will not take place until AF reclamation requirements are met. Failure to do so will result in potential  loss  of  parts.  The  PM  must  consider  transferring  assets  to  AFMC  Aerospace Maintenance  and  Regeneration  Activity  for  reclamation  when  non-programmed requirements cannot be met on-site. Non-programmed reclamation must be planned prior to requesting save lists. 5.12.2.3.  AFI 20-115, specifies the authority for retention of aircraft engines. 5.12.2.4.  Reclamation  processes  in  this  section  primarily  support  AF-managed  assets. PM/SSM/EIM  organizations  supporting  CLS  weapon  system  support  programs  must comply  with  the  intent  of  DoD  reclamation  requirements  and  design  CLS  reclamation processes accordingly. 5.12.2.5.  Reclamations will be based upon the following criteria: 5.12.2.5.1.  A justifiable requirement exists. 5.12.2.5.2.  Removal must be economical. If it is not economical, the requirement will be based on an extreme urgency or lack of any other known supply sources. 5.12.2.5.3.  Based-funded items required locally may be reclaimed by retail activities when the parts can be economically removed and restored to a serviceable condition by the reclaiming activity. 5.12.2.5.4.  Resources  must  be  available  for  the  timely  repair  of  reclaimed unserviceable items. 5.12.2.6.  Reclaimed items must be returned to proper materiel management activities and maintained on accountable records. 5.12.2.7.  Priority  reclamation  of  DLA  items  must  be  initiated  by  DLA  or  a  DLA designated SOS representative. 5.12.2.8.  Aircraft  that  crashed  before  19  November  1961,  and  that  remain  wholly  or partially unrecovered, are considered formally abandoned. The AF neither maintains title to, nor has property interest in, these aircraft. 5.12.2.8.1.  The  authority  for  access  to,  and  recovery  of,  these  aircraft,  as  well  as liability  for  damages  associated  with  their  recovery,  are  matters  to  be  resolved between persons seeking recovery and landowners of the wreckage sites. 5.12.2.8.2.  When  any  human  remains  are  discovered  at  the  site,  recovery  personnel should  immediately  contact  the  nearest  United  States  Embassy  or  United  States military installation. To assist in proper identification of remains, recovery personnel 180 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 should refrain from further operations at the site pending removal of the remains by United States experts. 5.12.2.9.  Programmed/non-programmed  disposal  freeze  requests  may  be  generated  by HAF, AFMC, or as a result of a request from an AFMC Air Logistics Complex or ICP. 5.12.3.  Review  of  Potential  Reutilization  (Excess)  Wholesale  Stock  Prior  to  Approval  for Disposal.  All  potential  reutilization  (excess)  items  must  be  reviewed  prior  to  disposal  to ensure that no known or projected requirements exist. 5.12.3.1.  This  review  will  include  exploring  possible  needs  due  to  NHA  application, possible modification to a usable configuration, uses for other than its intended purpose and reclamation of component parts. 5.12.3.2.  This review may result in the retention of computed excess assets. 5.12.4.  Impairment 5.12.4.1.  Impairment  is  a  significant  and  permanent  decline  in  the  service  utility  of  an asset due to damage, obsolescence, or when the asset is excess to requirements. To meet the definition of impairment, the asset is no longer required by any Air Force activity and is  being  placed into long-term  storage  with  no  expectation  of being  returned to  service. Typically such assets are shipped to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) to be held until disposal is directed by the owing activity. 5.12.4.2.  Indicators of impairment 5.12.4.2.1.  Evidence of physical damage 5.12.4.2.2.  Enactment or approval of laws or regulations which limit or restrict usage 5.12.4.2.3.  Changes in environmental or economic factors 5.12.4.2.4.  Technological changes or evidence of obsolescence 5.12.4.2.5.  Changes in the manner or duration of use of the asset 5.12.4.2.6.  Construction stoppage or contract termination 5.12.4.2.7.  Assets is idled or unserviceable for excessively long periods 5.12.4.3.  Impairment Test 5.12.4.3.1.  The magnitude of the decline in service utility is significant. 5.12.4.3.2.  The decline in service utility is expected to be permanent. The decline is considered permanent when management has no reasonable expectation that the lost service utility will be replaced or restored. 5.12.4.4.  Documenting  evidence  of  management’s  decision  to  permanently  remove  the asset from service (Impairment). 5.12.4.4.1.  Documentation specifying that an asset is Impaired is required to support an  impairment  decision,  and  should  specify  that  the  asset  is  being  permanently removed from service and the asset’s use is terminated. 5.12.4.4.2.  The  Impairment  documentation  shall  be  signed  by  the  disposition authority (IM/PM). AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 181 5.12.4.5.  Financial Accounting for Impaired assets 5.12.4.5.1.  When the disposition authority (IM/PM) decides to permanently remove, retire,  and/or  dispose  of  an  asset  from  service  and  the  asset’s  use  is  terminated,  the asset’s  acquisition  cost  and  associated  accumulated  depreciation  shall  be  removed from the APSR general Property, Plant, and Equipment account and transferred to the Other General PP&E (Account 1890), IAW DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation  (FMR),  Volume  4,  and  Federal  Accounting  Standards  Advisory  Board (FASAB)  Statement  of  Federal  Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFFAS)  44: Accounting for Impairment of General Property, Plant, and Equipment Remaining in Use. *When Account 1890 is not available, account for impaired assets in an AFMC approved property accountability system. 5.12.4.5.2.  Upon completion of the disposal  of the asset, the storing  activity should write off the asset from its financial records. Any difference between the expected net realizable  value  previously  recorded  and  the  actual  disposition  amount  should  be recognized as a gain or loss. 5.12.4.6.  When impaired assets are returned to service, comply with reclamation process per this instruction. 182 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 Chapter 6 MATERIEL RETURNS Section 6A—Overview 6.1.  Overview.  This  chapter  outlines  AF  guidance  for  the  supply  chain  materiel  management processes  associated  with  materiel  returns  and  disposal  of  materiel.  These  activities  include Returns, Disposal and the Precious Metals Recovery Program (PMRP). As listed in Attachment 1, various DoD and AF publications are reference sources for this publication. For this chapter, DoD  4100.39-M,  DoDM  4140.01  and  DoD  4160.21-M,  and  DoD  4160.28-M-V2,  Defense Demilitarization Manual serve as primary DoD reference sources. 6.1.1.  Roles and Responsibilities. 6.1.1.1.  AFMC will: 6.1.1.1.1.  Update  the  Reparable  Item  Movement  Control  System  (RIMCS)  data master file to include reparable NSNs under Depot Maintenance Interservice Support agreements (DMISA). 6.1.1.1.2.  Direct return of retail assets only if there are insufficient wholesale assets to  support  the  weapon  system  or  end  item  throughout  its  remaining  life,  instead disposal instructions will be provided. 6.1.1.1.3.  Control  work  load  volume  input  to  repair  contractors  to  prevent accumulation of excess reparables at the contractor facility. 6.1.1.2.  LRS/Materiel Management Activity will: 6.1.1.2.1.  Process all retail level return requests through the FSC. (T-2) 6.1.1.2.2.  Coordinate  with  maintenance  to  identify  components  for  which  there  is base level repair capability as well as no base level repair capability and update repair cycle  records.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  will  review  this  information at least semiannually. (T-2) 6.1.1.2.3.  Recover consumable useable material defined by DoD 4160.21-M. (T-0) 6.1.1.2.4.  Establishment  of  on-base  and  off-base  pick  up  points  for  return  of consumable materiel. (T-3) 6.1.1.2.5.  Establish  agreements  with  the  servicing  DLADS  that  ensure  cooperation, support, and assistance. (T-3). 6.1.1.2.6.  All AF materiel management activities processing returns (serviceable and unserviceable) will: (T-2). 6.1.1.2.6.1.  Conduct  bare  item  inspection  to  verify  the  identification  and  ensure tags and documentation are completed prior to return IAW this chapter. (T-3). 6.1.1.2.6.2.  Research  shipment  shortages  thoroughly  to  attempt  to  find  missing asset  and  include  them  in  the  shipment.  When  it  is  impractical  to  recover component  shortages,  the  release/receipt  document  listing  the  shortages  will  be AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 183 certified. (T-3). 6.1.1.2.6.3.  Return  reparables  only  to  the  shipment  DoDAAC  contained  in  the repair cycle record. (T-3). 6.1.1.2.6.4.  Not is automatically transshipped to  the applicable  repair point, unless  there is  obvious or suspected evidence that condition or identity is incorrect. (T-3). inspect  reparables  which  are  received in  error  and 6.1.1.2.6.5.  Handle returned assets in such a manner to prevent further damage or cost  to  the  government.  Packing  and  crating  will  be  accomplished  as  prescribed by  appropriate  TOs  and  packaging  directives  IAW  AFMAN  24-206  (IP), Packaging of Materiel. (T-2). 6.1.1.2.6.6.  FOB Materiel. Assets in the possession of base customers that are not correctly  accounted  for  on  supply  system  due-in  from  maintenance  or  in-use equipment detail records are commonly referred to as found on base (FOB). AFI 23-111 requires the prompt recording of all property found on an installation not maintained  in  an  account  table  system.  FOB  property  will  be  processed  by  the Flight  Service  Center.  FOB  items  will  be  thoroughly  researched  before  being ADDED  to  the  accountable  record.  Controlled  items  will  not  be  processed  as FOB.  Controlled  items  will  use  Special  Inventory  guidance  to  clear  FOB conditions; an ROS will be required to add such items to the accountable record. (T-2). See AFMAN 23-122, Table 6.2 for exceptions. 6.1.1.3.  Customers in possession of assets will comply with following guidance prior to returning  property  to  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  to  ensure  proper identification, condition and complete documentation (i.e. forms, tags, reports, etc.): 6.1.1.3.1.  TO 00-20-3, TO 00-35D-54, AFI 21-101, AFI 21-102, Depot Maintenance Management, AFMAN 24-206 (IP), Packaging of Materiel, and AFMAN 23-122. For maintenance  activities  that  are  non-Aircraft,  refer  to  AFPD  21-1  for  the  governing maintenance publication. 6.1.1.4.  All  activities,  which  are  not  in  the  Stock  Number  User  Directory  (SNUD)  or equivalent  program  and  therefore  do  not  receive  RIMCS  data  (i.e.  contractors, universities, AFROTC), will ship AF reparable materiel to an authorized repair point. (T-2). 6.1.1.5.  All  activities  will  not  remove  Item  Identification  Plates  or  Labels  on  material being returned. (T-2). Section 6B—Returns 6.2.  Returns 6.2.1.  Assets  no  longer  used  by  retail  materiel  management  activities  will  be  returned  or transferred for disposal. 6.2.2.  Recoverables/Reparables. 184 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 6.2.2.1.  Maintenance  will  return  recoverable  items  to  the  wholesale  and  retail  materiel management  systems  after  repair  has  been  attempted  (either  successfully  or unsuccessfully) IAW Sec. 5C. 6.2.2.1.1.  Reparable  items  coded  “XD”  and  “ND.”  Serviceable  "XD2"  items  will only be returned to depot stocks or transferred to disposal when directed by the IM. 6.2.2.1.2.  Reparable Items Coded “XF,” or “NF.” 6.2.2.1.2.1.  To  preclude  the  unwarranted  disposal  of  economically  reparable "XF" or "NF" items which are beyond the capability, capacity, or need of the base to repair, the following criteria are established: 6.2.2.1.2.1.1.  Items  coded  "XF"  and  "NF"  will  be  processed  to  the  DLADS when they are in condemned condition. 6.2.2.1.2.1.2.  Reparable "NF" items not in condemned condition and having a line item value (quantity items x unit cost) less than $100 will be processed to DLADS.  Items  in  this  category  may  be  held  as  long  as  the  base  considers necessary for possible future repair and reuse. 6.2.2.1.2.1.3.  Reparable "NF" items not in condemned condition and having a line  item  value  of  $100  or  more  will  be  reported  to  the  IMs  for  disposition instructions. 6.2.2.1.2.1.4.  Reparable  "XF"  items  requiring  depot  repair  will  be  identified in RIMCS. 6.2.2.1.2.1.5.  Reparable  "XF"  items  not  in  the  RIMCS  will  be  processed  to DLADS, unless critical. (Exception: personnel parachute components). 6.2.2.1.2.1.6.  Guidance  outlined  in  this  paragraph  does  not  pertain  to  items recovered  by  reclamation  at  the  AFMC  Aerospace  Maintenance  and Regeneration Activity. 6.2.2.1.3.  When  notified  to  ship  reparable  (part  numbered)  Quick  Reaction Capability  (QRC)  equipment  to  a  contractor  or  depot  field  team,  shipments  will  be made by the most expeditious means available. 6.2.2.1.4.  Shipment of reparable and TCTO materiel to repair contractors. 6.2.2.1.4.1.  Reparable  and  TCTO  materiel  will  be  shipped  to  repair  contractors when the appropriate RIMCS data is reflected, except when directed by the IM. 6.2.2.1.4.2.  RIMCS applies to all reparables which can appropriately be shipped from the generating activity to the contractor repair facility. 6.2.2.1.5.  Movement  of  Test,  Measurement,  &  Diagnostic  Equipment  will  be  done IAW TO 00-20-14, Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program. 6.2.3.  Consumables items coded XB or NF1. 6.2.3.1.  DoD  and  AF  policy  mandates  all  government  materiel  will  be  fully  used  and reused  when  the  materiel  can  be  used  effectively,  economically,  and  safely.  Activities AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 185 will  never  discard  usable  material.  The  following  guidelines  for  determining  the usefulness of items apply to both on-base and off-base organizations. 6.2.3.1.1.  All consumable items, serviceable or unserviceable, having potential use or resale  value,  will  be  collected,  retained,  and  returned  to  the  retail  Materiel Management  Activity.  The  retail  Materiel  Management  Activity  will  reissue  and redistribute them, repair and reuse them, or transfer them to DLADS as scrap. 6.2.4.  NWRM. NWRM items will be returned IAW AFI 20-110 and, Sec. 10B. 6.2.5.  Deficiency Report (DR) Exhibit Returns. DR exhibit return actions will comply with TO 00-35D-54. Section 6C—Disposal, Demilitarization and PMRP 6.3.  Disposal, Demilitarization and PMRP. 6.3.1.  Disposal Guidance. 6.3.1.1.  DoD  4160.21-M  and  DoD  4160.28-M,  implements  the  requirements  of  the Federal  Property  Management  Regulation  (FPMR),  as  it  applies  to  the  disposition  of excess and surplus materiel. 6.3.1.2.  Primary  Inventory  Control  Authority  (PICA)  and  Secondary  Inventory  Control Activity  (SICA).  PICAs  have  final  disposition  authority  for  assets  under  their management.  Therefore,  SICAs  will  not  dispose  of  items  until  they  receive  written authorization  from  the  appropriate  PICAs.  PICAs  will  provide  SICAs  the  current  "ship to" information for reparable materiel. 6.3.1.3.  Retail activities will transfer centrally procured secondary and principal items to disposal  only  when  directed  by  the  IM,  unless  identified  as  authorized  for  immediate transfer  to  disposal.  Component  materiel  identified  by  an  IM  for  possible  disposal  but with  potential  for  reutilization  will  be  transferred  to  DLADS,  unless  new  information justifies retention. 6.3.1.4.  The LRS/Materiel Management Activity may locally-direct transfers to DLADS when: the item is unserviceable or when the item is a locally assigned stock number and the item is no longer required; the item does not support an active weapon system or end item;  and  all  disposal  authority  criteria  has  been  met.  Hazmat  disposal  must  be coordinated  through  local  environmental  staff  using  EESOH-MIS  for  an  evaluation  of hazardous waste regulations and requirements. 6.3.1.5.  AFMC will ensure all of the following disposal criteria for serviceable items are met before disposal action is taken: Table 6.1.  Enterprise Date Points to Equal Zero. Requisition Objective Daily Demand Rate Cumulative Recurring Demands Number Demands Current Number Demands Past 6 Months 186 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 Number Demands 7-12 Months Due-Outs Due-Ins Due-In From Maintenance Equip Authorization Equip On-Hand RSP Authorization RSP On-Hand SPRAM Authorization SPRAM On-Hand Bench Stock Flag Supply Point Flag Life of System Level Count 6.3.1.5.1.  For consumable serviceable items required to support and maintain active weapon system or end item: (T-2). 6.3.1.5.2.  The disposal criteria for BC 8 (XB3, XF3) and BC 9 (XB3, XF3, and NF1) is authorized when DOLD is greater than 10 years, SPC assigned is 5 or E, and Date SPC assigned is greater than 9. (T-2). 6.3.1.5.3.  For consumable items not required to support and maintain active weapon system or end item: 6.3.1.5.3.1.  The disposal criteria for BC 8 (XB3, XF3) and BC 9 (XB3, XF3, and NF1) is authorized when DOLD is greater than 3 years, SPC assigned is  5 or E, and Date SPC assigned is greater than 2 years. 6.3.1.6.  Base-level  organizations  will  transfer  materiel  to  DLADS  for  items  not processed  through  the  applicable  materiel  management  IT  system.  (T-2).  This  includes the transfer of scrap and GPC purchased items. 6.3.1.6.1.  Segregation  of  scrap  materiel  is  necessary  to  minimize  DLADS  handling costs and to ensure maximum return from the sale of disposed materiel. Segregation of  scrap  materiel  will  be  accomplished  by  base  organizations  initiating  materiel transfers to DLADS. 6.3.1.6.2.  When  items  are  coded  disposal,  disposing  organizations’  items  must  be turned  into  DLADS  and/or  demilitarized  prior  to  transfer  IAW  the  demil  code assigned,  DoD  4160.21-M,  DoD  4160.28-M,  and  AFMAN  23-122,  Sec.  6C, Disposal, Demilitarization and PMRP. 6.3.1.6.3.  Disposal  of  NWRM  and  scrap  from  NWRM  will  follow  guidance  in  AFI 20-110. 6.3.1.6.4.

This  chapter  also  establishes  policy  on  the  administration  and  use  of  the Integrated Logistics System – Supply (ILS-S). The policy described in this section is applicable to all subsystems of the ILS-S (the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS), Enterprise Solution-Supply  (ES-S),  and  the  AF  Supply  Central  Database  (AFSCDB).)  except  where  explicitly excluded.  Specific  procedures  to  create  and  maintain  user  accounts  within  each  particular subsystem of ILS-S are addressed in AFH 23-123. Section 7B—Automated Identification Technology (AIT) and MMHS and Other Capabilities 7.2.  AIT, MMHS and Other Capabilities. 7.2.1.  Automated  Identification  Technology  (AIT).  A  group  of  technologies  to  improve material identification and data collection. The implementation of AIT capability within the AF  shall  be  done  through  the  ELS  initiative  and  IAW  DoDM  4140.01.  The  adoption, acquisition  and  implementation  of  AIT  capabilities  shall  be  accomplished  at  the  enterprise level  unless  AF/A4L  has  granted  an  exception  to  this  guidance.  Requests  for  exception  to guidance shall be made in writing and coordinated with MAJCOM A4 and AF/A4LR. 7.2.1.1.  Asset  Marking  and  Tracking  (AMT).  AMT  enables  total  asset  management throughout the supply chain by ensuring the consistent marking and tracking of all assets. AMT  automatically  identifies  and  tracks  high  cost,  high  impact,  and  other  critical individual components from acquisition through transportation, supply, maintenance, and disposal. This includes consumables and non-serialized assets along with selected assets as  identified  within  the  OSD-led  Serialized  Item  Management  (SIM)  initiative.  AMT shall  use  existing  capabilities  and  policy,  such  as  IUID,  and  Radio  Frequency Identification (RFID). 7.2.1.1.1.  For  operational  security  purposes,  AFOSI  assets  that  are  used  for surveillance  missions  will  not  be  labeled  with  identification  markings.  Also,  assets will not be marked when identification markings hinder the use of the equipment (i.e. size, technical use). 7.2.1.2.  Enterprise  Asset  Tracking.    Use  enterprise  asset  tracking  in  the  retail  system.  The capability is comprised in large part of mobile device technology such as hand-held terminals. The technology will support the asset accountability function, warehouse pulls and put-aways, receipt and turn-in  processing, asset  delivery, warehouse  and equipment inventory  processing,  and  warehouse  location  validation  processing.    When  mobile device  technology  is  not  available  (either  due  to  hardware  or  network  constriction,  use Air Force approved modernized desktop application capable of the same function. 7.2.2.  IUID is a key enabler for automatic data capture on key items. This allows for capture of  accurate  lifecycle  data  that  can  be  aggregated  and  analyzed  by  planners,  engineers,  and logisticians  to  produce  predictive  maintenance  strategies.  IUID  implementation  will  meet 190 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 requirements in MIL STD-130, Identification Marking of U.S. Military Property, and DoDI 8320.04. 7.2.2.1.  SAF/AQ.  The  SAF/AQ  manages  IUID  implementation  with  the  acquisition  of new assets. 7.2.2.2.  AF/A4LR. AF/A4LR provides policy alignment strategy and oversight of IUID. 7.2.2.3.  AFMC/A4N.  AFMC/A4N  manages  IUID  implementation  and  sustainment  for legacy items to include Class II, VII, and IX supply items. 7.2.2.4.  Radio  Frequency  Identification.  Active  RFID  supports  asset  visibility  and improved  logistic  business  processes  throughout  the  DoD  logistics  enterprise.  The  AF maintains  an  active  RFID  infrastructure  IAW  with  DoD  policy  directives.  This infrastructure  primarily  supports  distribution  activities  tracking  shipments  to,  from  and between  OCONUS  locations.  The  use  of  such  automatic  identification  ensures  minimal or  no  manual  data  entry,  improves  data  accuracy  and  timeliness.  The  supporting  AF RFID  implementation  plan  encompasses  both  active  and  passive  RFID  technology  in  a cohesive environment to support the DoD vision will be IAW DoD and other applicable directives. 7.2.3.

The  MAJCOM  focal  point  is  the  liaison  between  the MAJCOM  Program  Manager  (PM)  and  the  AFMC  MMHS/SAS  Program Manager. to  AFMC 7.2.3.1.5.5.  AFMC PE manages all technical aspects of a project. These include: the  initial  evaluation  of  requirements,  cost  data,  design  (i.e.  the  preparation  of drawings  and  specifications),  contracting  package,  evaluation  of  technical proposals, and acceptance of installed equipment. When the MMHS/SAS project is  associated  with  a  MILCON  project,  the  PE  will  attend  all  MILCON  Design Conferences. 7.2.3.1.5.6.  AFMC  coordinates  funding,  manages  obligations  and  expenditures IAW AFI 65-601, and maintains financial management liaison with SAF/AQ and the AFMC PM. 7.2.3.1.6.  Base  Level.  The  Base  Project  Officer  (BPO)  is  designated  by  the  using organization’s commander to be responsible for coordinating all on-site activities of a particular  MMHS/SAS  project.  The  BPO  will  be  part  of  the  using  activity  and  be fully involved with project development. 7.2.3.2.  Guidance  regarding  MMHS  usage.  MMHS  includes  (but  is  not  limited  to) equipment,  process  controllers,  or  equipment  shelters  required  to  handle  materials  in  a proven,  systematic,  mechanized  manner.  Note:  MMHS  does  not  include  systems  that require research and development.  Systems  must be either "off-the-shelf” or made from off-the-shelf  components.  MMHS  also  does  not  include:  equipment  which  is  item managed  (unless  included  as  part  of  a  total  system),  general  purpose  forklifts,  ISU containers, conventional pallet jacks, floor scrubbers, refrigerators, and freezers. When a system  does  not  meet  the  above  criteria,  AFMC  decides  whether  it  qualifies  under  the MMHS program. 7.2.3.3.  Types of MMHS include: 7.2.3.3.1.  All types of conveyors, including 463L pallet conveyor. 7.2.3.3.2.  Narrow-aisle vehicles (guided by wire, radio, rail, light, or laser). 7.2.3.3.3.

It  also  includes  any  support  equipment  required  to  provide  a completely functional storage system, or specialized function within a larger system. 7.2.3.5.  Identification  of  Requirement.  The  base  identifies  the  need  for  the  project  and creates  the  Concept  Paper  for  the  MMHS/SAS  project.  The  base  submits  the  concept paper,  which  must  be  validated  and  updated  annually,  to  the  MAJCOM  Program Manager until funded. 7.2.3.6.  Economic Analysis. When required by AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis, the base is responsible for ensuring an economic analysis is prepared by the installation financial analysis office. 7.2.3.7.  Local  Infrastructure  Improvements.  Local  infrastructure  improvements  are required  to  support  an  MMHS/SAS  project.  These  improvements  (e.g.  new  transformer or  fire  pump)  cannot  be  funded  with  MMHS/SAS  funds  and  must  therefore  be  funded through another source. 7.2.3.8.  Installation Planning. Installation planning and scheduling will be accomplished after  completion  of  the  system  design  and  before  contracting  of  the  project.  Where necessary,  installation  plans  are  built  into  the  MMHS/SAS  contract  to  ensure  the equipment  installation  follows  the  predetermined  plan.  Installation  plans  include orientation  of  personnel  in  the  concept  of  operation  of  the  equipment  and  a  plan  for maintenance of the system. The base develops this plan with assistance from the PE. 7.2.3.9.  Contracting  Package.  After  receiving  the  contracting  package  from  the  PE,  the base  coordinates  the  package  with  the  appropriate  local  organizations.  The  base  directs any  comments  or  questions  on  the  package  to  the  PE,  who  modifies  the  contracting package as necessary. 7.2.3.10.  Contingency Plan. The base writes a contingency plan for the proposed system. Use  of  MMHS/SAS  must  consider  enemy  attack  and  power  outages.  There  must  be provisions for working around damaged or inoperable equipment and accessing material in support of the mission. The using organization commander approves the plan. 7.2.3.11.  Post Award Conference. The base attends the post award conference and assists the Contracting Officer and PE, as requested. 7.2.3.12.  Equipment  Installation.  The  base  monitors  contractor  performance  during  the installation of the equipment, reporting any problems to the PE. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 193 7.2.3.13.  Equipment  Accountability.  The  base  shall  maintain  equipment  accountability for MMHS/SAS under the applicable Support Equipment APSR and procedures. 7.2.3.14.  Programming for MMHS. 7.2.3.14.1.  Programming  Projects.  In  the  second  quarter  of  each  fiscal  year,  AFMC will  send  a  requirements  call  letter  to  each  MAJCOM  requesting  an  MMHS/SAS Priority List. 7.2.3.14.2.  Project Design. Once an MMHS/SAS project is identified as funded, the AFMC PE begins the design process. MMHS/SAS projects are typically designed for existing (non-MILCON) facilities or newly constructed (MILCON) facilities. 7.2.3.14.3.  Non-MILCON  Related  MMHS/SAS.  Design  of  a  project  includes collection and analysis of data, equipment  selection, development  of the layout,  and preparation  of  the  contracting  package  by  AFMC.  When  the  contracting  package  is complete, the PE sends it to the base for review and local coordination. 7.2.3.14.4.  MMHS/SAS  Associated  with  a  MILCON  Project.  The  process  is  the same for Non-MILCON related MMHS/SAS. However, the design process must start much  sooner  (as  much  as  a  year  before  funding),  usually  with  the  PE  attending  the initial  MILCON  conference  (Concept  Phase)  at  the  site.  The  building  will  be designed around the operation/equipment; it is paramount that the PE determines the appropriate MMHS/SAS before the MILCON process gets underway. Section 7C—Supply Chain Materiel Management Systems 7.3.  Supply Chain Materiel Management Systems. 7.3.1.  AF  materiel  management  systems  shall  comply  with  the  requirements  of  DoDM 4140.01,  and  AFI  33-108,  Compatibility,  Interoperability,  and  Integration  of  Command, Control,  Communications,  and  Computer  (C4)  Systems.  Use  of  DoD  or  AF  SCM  systems and Item Manager Wholesale Requisition Process IT systems is mandatory for all AF owned assets.  AF/A4  may  waive  this  requirement  for  systems  that  it  identifies  as  meeting requirements for visibility and accountability of assets across the supply chain. 7.3.2.  AF materiel management IT systems shall support tactical and strategic planning and robust  maintenance  practices  as  well  as  implement  unimpeded  distribution  of  goods. Concurrently,  the  systems  will  ensure  proper  tracking  and  identification  of  assets,  support proper  sourcing  and  maintain  solid  financial  management  accountability  of  the  AF  supply chain. 7.3.3.

Section 7E—Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S) 7.5.  Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S). 7.5.1.  System  Administration.  The  Supply  community  has  the  responsibility  to  administer the  ILS-S  system  access  and  security  program  in  accordance  with  the  identification  and authentication  procedures  outlined  in  this  publication,  AFMAN  33-282,  Computer  Security (COMPUSEC), (PMO)-produced  Rapid Program  Management  Office ILS-S 196 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 Communications  Messages  (RAPCOMs)  and  other  security  guides  as  applicable.  All  users are required to submit an automated System Authorization Access Request (SAAR). The DD Form 2875 may be used in situations where an automated submission method is not available or is prohibited by DISA. The level of approval required on the SAAR will be based on the user’s status (for example, type of user and location). Access will only be permitted for those functions required for mission accomplishment. 7.5.2.  Controlled Access. A high degree of control over the ILS-S system and data access to logistics  data  is  warranted  due  to  security  and  proprietary  data  issues.  ILS-S  has  several security  features that will lock user accounts and render the account  inaccessible. Accounts will  only  be  unlocked  after  positive  identification  is  made  in  person  with  a  CAC,  an encrypted  email  or  use  of  the  Telephone  Challenge  Word.  The  authentication  method  is  at the  discretion  of  the  ILS-S  Administrator.  Passwords  will  only  be  transmitted  from  the administrator to the user by means of encrypted email. ES-S access is granted through the Air Force Portal using CAC authentication. 7.5.2.1.  Restrict Direct SBSS Access. Direct access to the SBSS is limited to users with a validated mission need for functions not supported in any other component of ILS-S. All requests  for  direct  access  to  the  SBSS  made  by  personnel  outside  AFMC  must  be requested in writing and approved by AF/A4LR. A signed copy of this authorization will be maintained with the SAAR and reviewed quarterly by AFMC during validations.  (T-2).The  coordination  can  be  done  by  signed  email.  All  requests  will  be  reviewed  and validated annually by AF/A4LR to ensure direct SBSS access is still warranted. 7.5.2.2.  Tiered  Administration.  ILS-S  is  based  on  a  tiered  administration  concept  that includes a hierarchy of system administrators. Higher level administrators manage lower level  administrators and  lower level  administrators manage the users. Further details  on the tiered administration concept can be found in the ES-S User’s Manual Chapter 29. 7.5.2.3.  Administrative  and  Transaction  Groups.  ILS-S  Administrative  and  Transaction Groups  will  be  standardized  across  the  enterprise.  All  changes  will  be  requested  in writing through the requestor’s MAJCOM to AF/A4LR for approval. 7.5.2.4.  Proprietary  Information. Users assigned  to  Contractor  Inventory  Control Points (C-ICPs) will not be granted access to asset and order information from other CICPs. The Contractor’s  Government  Sponsor  and  the  IAO  responsible  for  each  Administrative Group  will  ensure  compliance  to  this  restriction  during  quarterly  system  generated validations. (T-2). 7.5.3.  Automated  User  Account  Validation.  The  ILS-S  Administrators  will  perform  a validation of user accounts quarterly.  (T-2). The ILS-S Administrator will be notified by an alert or e-mail that a validation is required. 7.5.4.  User  Administration.  Administrators  serve  as  trusted  agents  to  grant  and  maintain access  rights  to  individual  users  in  their  units  and  Administrative  Groups.  Organizational commanders  whose  responsibilities  include  oversight  of  ILS-S  operations  will  review  and approve  or  disapprove  the  SAAR  for  all  users  requesting  administrative  privileges.  (T-1) Commanders, with approval from AF/A4LR for direct access to the SBSS (discussed in this chapter),  will  also  appoint  (through  DISA)  an  Alternate  IAO  (AIAO)  for  controlling  and monitoring SBSS unique security requirements. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 197 7.5.4.1.  Qualifications.  Only  USAF  Military/Civilians  or  Support  Contractors  working under contract to the USAF can be appointed as ILS-S administrators (including AIAOs). C-ICP users will NOT be appointed as ILS-S administrators. 7.5.4.2.  Appointment.  AFMC  will  determine administering accounts. (T-2). the level  and responsibility for 7.5.4.3.  Responsibilities.  Administrators  are  charged  with  approving,  monitoring  and updating  user  accounts  when  permissions  change.  They  ensure  the  appropriate  level  of approval  has  been  obtained  before  allowing  access  to  and  use  of  ILS-S  applications. Administrators  will  also  disable  accounts  immediately  in  any  situation  requiring additional  research  to  validate  the  account.  Administrators  will  immediately  archive  all accounts that are no longer required to perform the mission. (T-2). 7.5.4.3.1.  Understand DoD, DISA and Air Force Policy and Procedures. Do not rely solely  on  policy  in  the  instruction.  All  administrators  must  also  have  a  thorough understanding  of  all  DoD  ,  DISA  and  Air  Force  policy,  manuals,  handbooks  and Security Technical Implementation Guides regarding system and user administration. 7.5.4.3.2.  Manage  System  Access  Authorization  Requests  (SAARs).  Maintaining SAARs  is  mandatory  and  vital  to  passing  system  security  audits.  Failure  to  pass  a system  security  audit  will  result  in  a  re-audit  within  90  days  and  may  result  in removal as a User Administrator. SAARs maintained outside ILS-S must be centrally located to enable rapid retrieval, validation and access by auditors. SAARs contain a user’s  personal  data  and  should  only  be  accessed  by  those  in  a  “need  to  know" position. 7.5.4.3.3.  Perform  Information  Owner  Duties.  The  Information  Owner  (IO) capability will only be assigned to administrators charged with local IO duties by the accountable officer. The IO will review all base level user requests and forward to the IAO  for  approval/disapproval.  The  IO  must  verify  the  SAAR  contains  only  the minimum privileges required to perform the mission.. (T-2). 7.5.4.3.4.  Perform  Information  Assurance  Officer  Duties.  ILS-S  IAOs  are  only located at AFMC. The IAO will review and approve or disapprove all user requests. The IAO must verify the SAAR contains only the privileges required to perform the mission. Extra scrutiny will take place at this level since the IAO is the last person in the  approval  chain  prior  to  account  creation  and  privileges  being  granted. Administrators will not update a data element the user has the capability to update in their profile. All requests to alter permissions in ILS-S will be documented using the automated SAAR. Under no circumstances will an administrator restore or reactivate an  account  when  it  is  clear  the  user  failed  to  fulfill  their  responsibilities or  to  avoid proper approval and validation by the supervisor, IO or IAO. 7.5.4.3.5.  Limit  SRAN  Access.  Administrators  will  not  grant  access  to  multiple accounts when  a base-level  user's  job only  requires access  to  a single SRAN. Users may  be  granted  privileges  for  multiple  SRANs  if  there  is  a  genuine  need  to  access multiple accounts (i.e. CRF, deployments, etc.). The IO and IAO will verify specific comments  justifying  the  need  for  access  to  multiple  SRANs  on  the  SAAR  to 198 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 document  this  exception  to  policy.  The  IAO  assigned  to  the  Admin  Group  will approve or disapprove all requests regardless of the source of the request. (T-1). 7.5.4.3.6.  Limit  Transaction  Identification  Code  (TRIC)  Group  Assignment.  Users are to be limited to a single primary TRIC group based on their job/duty title. A user may  possess  a  single  primary  TRIC  group  and  one  or  more  supplementary  TRIC group(s)  (i.e.  RVP,  ASSET-MGT  NWRM)  as  long  as  the  rational  for  the supplementary  TRIC  Group  are  clearly  stated  in  the  SAAR  Justification  block  and approved by the user’s approval chain (supervisor, administrator). Administrators will only grant a user access to the TRIC group associated to their job/duty title unless an exception to the policy is approved by HAF/A4LR and the exception is clearly stated in  the  SAAR  Justification  block.  (T-1).  TRIC  groups  allowing  access  to  warehouse responsibilities  and  duties  will  not  be  granted  to  a  user  that  also  has  Inventory Accountability  responsibilities.  This  policy  ensures  no  single  user  is  able  to  receive and issue property as well as accomplish scheduled/special inventories adjusting the item record for that same property. 7.5.4.3.7.  Validate  User  Accounts.  Administrators  will  complete the  ILS-S automated validation NLT the user’s validation due date to prevent the user’s account from being automatically disabled by the system. During the review, Administrators must  review  the  user’s  history  to  detect  adverse  trends  such  as  previously  denied access requests, erroneously assigned privileges not aligned with the user’s role (such as  assignment  of  multiple  SRAN  processing  privileges  for  a  base-level  user), expiration  dates  longer  than  three  years  and  base-level  users  with  the  “Get  It”  , “Release  Order”  or  similar  capabilities.  Validation  of  legacy  accounts  will  ensure only those transactions not available in ES-S are assigned to those users approved by AF/A4LR for SBSS access. 7.5.4.3.7.1.  Bulk  Load Not Authorized. The bulk uploading of validation data is not authorized without written approval of the AFMC 7.5.4.3.7.2.  Review  Administrator  Accounts.  AFMC  will  validate  all  SPO  and mid-level  administrator  accounts  each  quarter  during  the  automated  validation. The number of administrators will be maintained at the following ratios: 1 SPO-level admin per 1,500 users across the enterprise and 1 mid-level admin per 500 users across their Administrative Group. The mid-level administrator will validate low-  level  administrative  accounts  within  their  span  of  control  during  the automated validation. There will not be more than 2 low-level administrators per 100  users  supported  at  a  single  location.  Two  low-level  administrators  are authorized when the number of supported users is less than 100 users at a single geographical location. SPO-level administrators will only be located in the ILS-S Program  Office.  With  the  exception  of  the  NWRM  Admin  Group,  mid-level administrators  will  only  be  located  at  AFMC.  SBSS  administrators  will  only  be located at AFMC. DISA account validation and audit procedures will be followed to ensure compliance and continued access. (T-2). levels  will 7.5.4.3.7.3.  Prevent  Unauthorized  Use.  Administrators  at  all implement  proactive  measures  to  ensure  every  user’s  access  and  privileges  are reviewed prior to a change in the user’s status. This includes, but is not limited to, AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 199 transfer  (PCS,  PCA  and  new  duty  positions),  retirement,  administrative  action, changes  in  employment  status  or  extended  absences.  The  administrator  will ensure  the  user’s  account  expiration  date  is  updated  and  will  archive  the  user’s account(s)  NLT  1  duty  day  prior  to  the  user’s  last  day  in  that  role.  This  action ensures the user will have to apply for access through the user’s new supervisor, IO and  IAO  at  the  gaining location to  ensure the proper privileges are  assigned. This  will  be  accomplished  using  available  technology  and  processes  such  as  the vMPF contractor onboarding/departure procedures and locally-developed PCA checklists. in-processing/out-processing checklist functionality, 7.5.4.3.7.4.  Scrutinize  Deployment  Accounts.  Deployed  users  must  apply  for  a new  account  upon  arrival  in  the  deployed  location  through  the  ILS-S  automated SAAR if their duties require processing transactions against the deployed SRAN. The  user,  deployed  supervisor,  the  IO  and  the  IAO  will  ensure  the  account’s expiration  date  is  set  for  the  user’s  re-deployment  date.  Home  station  accounts will  be  subject  to  enterprise  rules  and  long  absences  will  result  in  the  account being disabled and archived by ILS-S. 7.5.4.3.7.5.  Scrutinize  Contractor  Accounts.  Contractors  perform  vital  services for the Air Force. However, their access to IL'S-S is contingent upon an approved and  up  to  date  contract  authorizing  their  continued  need  for  access.    The Government Sponsor and Information Owner must ensure the expiration date on the  contractor’s  account  is  the  last  day  of  the  current  contract.  Requests  for changes  to  the  expiration  date  must  be  requested  using  the  IL'S-S  automated SAAR  process  and  be  approved  by  the  Government  Sponsor  and  IL'S-S Administrators.  Any  account  that  expires  due  to  the  end  of  a  contract  requires submission  of  a  new  SAAR  to  ensure  accurate  recording  of  the  company  name, contract number and the continued approval of the government sponsor. (T-2). 7.5.4.3.7.6.  Scrutinize Multiple Accounts. There may be an operational  need for an ILS-S user to have more than one account. This can occur for several reasons to  include  joint  base  processing  with  separate  SBSS  accounts  within  close proximity  and  supporting  COOP  operations.  All  requests  for  multiple  accounts will contain a specific and detailed justification on the SAAR. 7.5.5.  Supervisor/US  Government  Sponsor  Responsibilities.  Supervisors  will  validate  the need for access requested and endorse SAARs. (T-3). A US Government Sponsor (normally the Contract QAE or Government PMO representative) must endorse (as the Supervisor) all ILSS  SAARs  for  contractor  personnel.  The  organizational  commander  will  serve  as  the supervisor  for  all  administrator  accounts.  Supervisors  are  also  responsible  for  the  timely validation of their subordinates’ user accounts. This includes removing privileges during the validation  process  that  are  no  longer  required.  It  is  the  supervisor’s/US  Government sponsor’s responsibility to notify the ILS-S Administrator NLT 3 duty days when a user no longer  requires  access  to  ILS-S.  This  notification  can  be  by  signed  email,  in-person  or  by telephone. 7.5.6.  User Responsibilities. ILS-S users are responsible for their actions on the system. This includes the responsibility to protect the ILS-S account(s) and to prevent unauthorized access to the ILS-S. 200 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 7.5.6.1.  Protect  Account  Access.  Account  sharing  is  strictly  prohibited.  It  is  a  security violation  to  leave  a  computer  unlocked  while  a  user  away  from  the  PC.  Violators  will have  accounts  archived  by  the  administrator.  The  user  will  re-apply  for  access  after reaccomplishing  Information  Assurance  Training  to  reinforce  security  policy  and procedures.  Users  will  also  contact  the  administrator  immediately  if  they  suspect  their account has been compromised. 7.5.6.2.  Request/Process  Account  Changes.  Users  will  update  changes  to  ILS-S  profile immediately as a condition of continued access. The ILS-S Automated SAAR will be the only mechanism to request changes to a user’s SRANs, capabilities and transactions. (T-1). Changes to an account not maintained by the automated SAAR require a new SAAR to  be  approved  and  routed  to  the  IAO/AIAO.  New  requests  and  changes  to  existing accounts  will  be  completed  by  the  user  NLT  3  duty  days  prior  to  the  operational requirement to allow for proper routing. (T-2). The user is also responsible for notifying the supervisor/US Government sponsor when ILS-S access or privileges to ILS-S are no longer required. 7.5.6.3.  Review  ILS-S  System  Messages.  Users  will  regularly  review  all  policy, procedures, RAPCOMs and the ILS-S SharePoint site to ensure proper use of the ILS-S. (T-1).  Failure to do so may result in the user’s account being disabled until appropriate training is completed to ensure compliance. 7.5.7.  Security  Manager  Responsibilities.  The  security  manager  with  access  to  a  user’s security  clearance  information  will  review  the  need  for  access  and  complete  the  Security Manager  section  of  the  SAAR.  (T-1).  This  includes  the  determination  to  approve  or disapprove the user’s access to ILS-S. 7.5.8.  Within  ILS-S,  SBSS  component,  Host  Constant  and  Support  Data  are  considered master data and will not be modified without notifying the ILS-S application adminsitrators in the ILS-S Program Office. Updates to the data are restricted to the AFMC Systems Flight using Unisys Demand Executive Command Language (ECL). Refer to AFH 23-123 v2 pt 3, Master Menu and List Constant Support Data for updating the Master Data. Within the ES-S component the DoDAAC screen is used to manage the master Data and updates are restricted to the ILS-S Program Office, application administrators. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 201 Chapter 8 LOGISTICS PROGRAMS AND SYSTEMS Section 8A—Overview 8.1.  Overview.  This chapter outlines AF guidance for logistics programs and systems regarding Cataloging  and  Records  Maintenance;  Uniform  Materiel  Movement  and  Issue  Priority  System (UMMIPS);  AF  Uniform  Clothing  Policy;  Price  Challenge  and  Verification  Program;  and Disposition  of  Critical  Safety  Items  (CSI).  As  listed  in  Attachment  1A,  various  DoD  and  AF publications  are  reference  sources  for  this  publication.  For  this  chapter,  DoD  4100.39-M, and,DoDM 4140.01 serve as primary DoD reference sources. Section 8B—Cataloging and Records Maintenance 8.2.  Cataloging and Records Maintenance. 8.2.1.  Cataloging  and  records  maintenances  actions  will  comply  with  US  Code  Title  10, Chapter  145,  Cataloging  and  Standardization,  the  DoD  4100.39-M;  the  Defense Standardization  Program  Policies  and  Procedures  Manual,  DoD  4120.24-M;  DoD  4140.26-M,  and  DoDM  4140.01  and  IAW  AFMAN  23-122,  Sec.  8B,  Cataloging  and  Records Maintenance. All  AF activities and their personnel,  including contracted  agents/entities, are responsible for ensuring that the policies and procedures are implemented and enforced. 8.2.1.1.  Cataloging.  Cataloging  actions  include  naming,  classifying,  describing,  and numbering items. It also includes the maintenance and dissemination of that information. AF  cataloging  operations  are  conducted  within  the  framework  of  the  Federal  Catalog Program (FCP) IAW DoD 4100.39-M. 8.2.1.2.  Records  maintenance.  Records  maintenance  actions  include  item  record  loads; research  and  processing  actions  for  non-cataloged  items;  preparing  and  processing  part number  loads,  changes,  and  deletions;  procedures  for  preparing  and  processing  changes to essential data on item, detail, and support records.

The AF Form 86, Request for Cataloging Data/Action will be used by AF activities to request Federal Supply Catalog actions to the DLIS Cataloging Center. The primary method AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 203 to  submit  a  request  for  cataloging  action  is  via  the  automated  AF  cataloging  system. However,  there  will  be  instances  where  the  system  will  not  accept  the  request  or  the  AF initiator does not have access to the system at their location. In this case, the hard copy AF Form  86  will  be  necessary.  AF  Forms  86  are  used  within  the  AF  only  and  will  not  be submitted  to  other  military  services  (Army,  Navy,  and  Marines)  or  to  a  DoD  integrated materiel manager. 8.2.4.1.  Submittal  of  cataloging  actions  by  initiator  will  always  be  accompanied  by Reference Number Category Code and Reference Number Variation Code. 8.2.4.2.  When cataloging actions are  completed, the AF  Form 86, indicating completed action will be returned to the initiator. 8.2.4.3.  Purpose  and  Nature  Of  Property  Classification.  The  rules  and  principles concerning the FSC are contained in DoD 4100.39-M, Volume 4. 8.2.4.4.  Item Aggregation. In addition to the FSC as a means of item aggregation, the AF uses  the  Materiel  Management  Aggregation  Code  (MMAC).  The  AF  logistics  system requires all weapons systems and technology group related items be assigned a MMAC for the purpose of: 8.2.4.4.1.  Segregating  property  according  to  air  and  ground  application,  when  not provided for by the FSC and required by supply management. 8.2.4.4.2.  Segregating items in specific classes for management purposes, where the FSC is too large or further relationship to an end item is required; such as 1560, 2840, FSG 14, etc. 8.2.4.4.3.  Items classified in FSCs 1560, 2810, 2840, 2845, 4935, 4960, and FSGs 14 and  18  must  have  a  MMAC  assigned  regardless  of  management  assignment  (i.e. DLA, AF, other service). 8.2.4.5.  Assignment of AF Control Numbers. 8.2.4.5.1.  Non-Cataloged (NC) Control Numbers: 8.2.4.5.1.1.  New  item  requests,  also  referred  to  as  non-cataloged  (NC)  numbers are  assigned  a  Standard  Inter-service  Agency  Serial  Control  Number  (SIASCN) constructed IAW DoD 4140.26-M-V6, Supply Support Requests (SSRs. 8.2.4.5.1.2.  The NC Control Number is used when a requirement exists for a new item to enter the supply system. This control number is assigned automatically by the AF system to control and monitor requests for NSN assignment. 8.2.4.5.1.3.  SIASCNs  are  assigned  to  all  potential  AF  managed  items  of  supply that  require  NSN  assignment.  SIASCNs  are  assigned  by  the  responsible  AFMC ICP,  which  is  generally  determined  by  the  MMAC  (i.e.  weapon  system  mission assignment). Non-weapon system/non-MMAC NSNs (e.g., medical items-FSG 65 and clothing- FSG 84 (except 8475)) will be determined by the FSC. 8.2.4.5.2.  Non-Definitive (ND) Control Numbers: 8.2.4.5.2.1.  Numbers are assigned by the AF system as a result of an AFMC ICP action to: 204 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 8.2.4.5.2.1.1.  Identify items not considered to be logical spares, on a one-time basis, for shipment of assets to support a part number requisition, or to show custody in support of an operational requirement. 8.2.4.5.2.1.2.  Establish controls within the AF system, on a temporary basis, for one-time buys of consumable (ERRC N), non-logical spares. 8.2.4.5.2.1.3.  Support special projects authorized by AFMC. 8.2.4.5.2.1.4.  Support non-standard one-time buy items in support of an FMS requirement. 8.2.4.5.2.2.  ND  numbers  are  “temporary”  control  numbers  used for accountability. They do not replace NSNs and the use of an ND number is not to exceed one year. 8.2.4.5.3.  Kits are assigned “K” numbers when established by AFMC. 8.2.4.5.4.  “P”  numbers  are  assigned  by  bases  for  control  of  items  having  a  true manufacturer’s  part/reference  number  of  10  digits  or  less.  When  the  part/reference number  exceeds  10  digits  or  if  more  than  one  part/reference  number  exists  for  the same item of supply, a “P” serialized number will be used. 8.2.4.5.5.  “L”  numbers  are  assigned  by  bases  when  a  “P”  number  cannot  be  used. (i.e. items without a part/reference number). When a valid requirement exists for the assignment  of  an  “L”  control  number,  bases  will  not  be  required  to  submit  an  AF Form 86. 8.2.4.5.5.1.  The  assignment,  justification,  control,  review,  maintenance  of register, cross-reference  file, etc. will be the responsibility of the activity  having supply support responsibility at that base or MAJCOM. 8.2.4.5.5.2.  Any  requirement  for  a  new  MMAC  (suffix  code)  for  MAJCOM numbers must be submitted to AFMC for approval. 8.2.4.5.6.  Each  item  assigned  a  control  number  in  an  accountable  file  will  be reviewed at least once a quarter by the assigning authority to determine the existence of an NSN. 8.2.5.  I&S Data. 8.2.5.1.  Management  of  I&S  data  will  be  done  IAW  DLAR  4140.66--  Elimination  of Duplication  in  the  Management  and  Logistics  Support  of  Interchangeable  and Substitutable Items. 8.2.5.2.  Item relationship data are developed, approved, and documented for sending and use throughout the AF and/or by other DoD activities, as required, through the media of the  AF  I&S  Grouping  Program.  Use  of  this  data  provides  for  more  effective  new  item entry control, utilization of available assets, supply support and orderly attrition of items from the inventory. 8.2.5.3.  The AF I&S Grouping Program provides for furnishing I&S data AF-wide on a current  basis  compatible  with  related  cataloging,  distribution,  and/or  materiel management systems. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 205 8.2.5.3.1.  I&S relationships are contained in the AF system and published only after careful research;  technical  comparison,  and assurance that the relationships revealed are  within  accepted  engineering  practices  and  meet  functional,  physical,  qualitative, and prescribed performance requirements. 8.2.5.3.2.  Substitution  and/or  interchange  of  items  of  supply  will  not  be  authorized and/or  orders  issued  for  shipment  unless  the  I&S  relationship  has  been  determined IAW the governing TO. Offers of substitute items under status code “BC” that cannot be readily  validated through these procedures will be submitted for  I&S  review  and determination IAW base interrogation procedures. 8.2.6.  Drawings and Associated Lists. 8.2.6.1.  Preparation  of  government  and  contractor  design  activity  drawings  and associated lists is  governed by MIL-T-31000,  General  Specification for  Technical Data Packages. 8.2.7.  Engineering data. 8.2.7.1.  AFI  21-101  provides  guidance  for  engineering  data  storage,  distribution,  and control..  All  engineering  data  will  be  compatible  with  the  Joint  Engineering  Data Management Information and Control System (JEDMICS). 8.2.7.2.  The  Engineering  Data  Manager  (EDM)  acquires  the  data  necessary  to logistically support the end item as stated in program management requirements. 8.2.7.3.  Contractor  design  activity  drawings  and  associated  lists  for  which  the government does not have unlimited rights, may not be released outside the government without written permission of the party asserting the limiting rights. 8.2.8.

Responsibilities  of  the  POC  include  researching  the  consolidated transaction history, confirmation or correction of records, scheduling the semiannual reconciliations,  reporting  semiannual  inventories,  and  scheduling  any  monthly reconciliation when necessary by the appointed COMSEC POC or LRS CC/AO. 10.2.10.  COMSEC Reconciliation. 10.2.10.1.  The AF is required (as directed by the National Security Agency) to account for  all  COMSEC  assets  requiring  serial  number  control.  All  COMSEC  assets  on applicable  materiel  management  system  detail  records  or  on  hand  in  supply  will  be reconciled semiannually prior to 15 March and 15 September. 10.2.10.2.  LRS/CC/AO will not maintain visibility of type account B COMSEC (ERRC XD/XF/XB)  assets  once  they  are  issued  to  the  using  organization  so  they  will  not  be included  in  the  annual  reconciliation  however,  when  these  items  are  shipped  the applicable materiel management system will report the serial number of the asset and that will  overlay  to  applicable  materiel  management  system  to  conform  to  national  security AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 227 agency  policy.  Note:  XD2  COMSEC  assets  used  in  support  of  RDT&E  programs  and projects  that are maintained on SPRAM accounts will be tracked 100% of the time and included in the annual COMSEC reconciliation. 10.2.10.3.  Out-of-Cycle  Reconciliation.  The  office  of  primary  responsibility  for  CCI, AFMC  Cryptologic  and  Cyber  Systems  Division  (CCSD),  JBSA-Lackland  Texas  may direct  out-of-cycle  reconciliation  reports  with  MAJCOM  approval.  When  bases  are directed to do these out-of-cycle reconciliations, transmission of data will be by the same method and to the same places as the scheduled annual reconciliation. 10.2.10.4.  Units will perform a local monthly COMSEC reconciliation by processing an R46 with a dash in position 64 to identify and resolve serial number discrepancies, IAW AFH 23-123, Chap 6. 10.2.11.  Special Logistics Support for Special Access Required (SAR) Parts Program. 10.2.11.1.  Required  when  normal  security  methods  cannot  protect  an  activity  from  a known threat, special access controls safeguard operational and technological advantages from potential enemies by limiting access to information about, or observation of, certain weapons, weapon systems, techniques, and operations. The term Special Access Program (SAP), often substituted for "Special Access Required (SAR)", may describe the security control system, the entire effort, and in some cases certain budget information. 10.2.11.2.  SAPs  must  obtain  approval into  a  Sensitive Compartmented  Information  Facility  (SCIF)  from  497  IG/INS  and  also  negotiate  a security agreement with 497 IG/INS. Refer to AFPD 16-7, Special Access Programs and AFI 16-701, Special Access Programs. to  introduce the  SAP 10.2.11.3.  Access  Requirements.  The  LRS  CC/AO  will  ensure  prior  to  activation  of  a special access program that personnel obtain proper clearances and are granted access by the  program  manager  or  their  designated  representative  for  receiving,  handling,  storing and  issuing  SAR  materiel.  (T-3).  For  contracted  supply  activities  the  government  must include in the Performance Work Statement the requirement for the contractor to have or hire  individuals  with  the  proper  clearance  for  SAR  processing.  The  LRS  CC/AO  will identify the number of individuals required to handle SAR material. (T-3). Only in rare or unusual  instances  will  office  administration  personnel  be  granted  access  to  SAR information, and then only if there is a valid need-to-know. Convenience or efficiency is not legitimate need-to-know criteria. 10.2.11.3.1.  After  the  individuals  are  granted  the  proper  clearance  and  the  storage area is inspected and certified, the program manager or their designated representative must  “read”  the  cleared  individuals  into  the  program  to  allow  the  proper  handling, storage and issue of SAR classified material. 10.2.11.3.2.  The  LRS  CC/AO  will  generate  and  keep  current  and  authorized  list  of on  base  personnel  authorized  to  receipt/handling  for  SAR  materiel.  This  listing  will be  used  to  update  the  applicable  materiel  management  system  and  confirm  only authorized personnel receive SAR items. (T-3). 10.2.12.  Item Unique Identification (IUID). Program. 228 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 10.2.12.1.  Overview. This section describes guidance for the capture and reporting of the Unique Item Identifier (UII) for IUID managed assets. 10.2.12.2.  The  AF  is  required  (as  directed  by  the  Department  of  Defense  (DoD))  to capture  and  report  the  UII  to  the  DoD  IUID  registry  for  all  IUID  managed  assets.  LRS personnel  are  required  to  scan/enter  the  UII(s)  of  IUID  managed  assets  when  prompted by the applicable ILS-S system. If UII is unavailable, submit transaction through the ILS-S system. 10.2.12.3.  IUID  managed  assets  are  identified  in  the  DoD  and  AF  cataloging  systems and  include  Class  II,  VII  and  IX  supply  items.  These  cataloging  systems  provide  the IUID indicator to the applicable ILS-S system. 10.2.12.4.  The  LRS  CC/AO  will  assign  a  single  point  of  contact  (POC)  for  referral  of inquiries regarding IUID managed assets. (T-2). 10.2.12.4.1.  Responsibilities  of  the  POC  include  researching  the  consolidated transaction history, delivery verification records and audit trail when necessary by the appointed IUID POC or LRS CC/AO.

The weapon may or may not be assigned to an individual. Actual  Unit  Price—The  latest  contract  price  plus  inflation  and  first  destination  transportation costs. This price is intended to approximate the price the item will cost on next acquisition. Additive  Requirement—Requirements  that  are  supported  by  projected  requirements  (e.g., modifications)  rather  than  past  demand  experience.  Requirements  computed  outside  the recoverable computation. Aircraft  Parts  Store—LRS  function  located  near  flight  line  maintenance  and  functions  as  a demand  processing  unit,  customer  service,  and  aircraft  parts  warehouse  for  maintenance activities. Aircraft  Sustainability  Model—The  mathematical  model  used  to  determine  the  requirements for recoverable RSP items (in the D087G system) It uses  a unit's wartime flying hour program, the range of items determined at the annual review, and the demand rate/indicative data for each item to determine the optimum mix of spares to achieve the target DSO. Allowance  Standard—Authorized document that  identifies the  amount and type of equipment for an organization. Approved  Acquisition  Objective—The  quantity  of  an  item  authorized  for  peacetime  and wartime  requirements  to  equip  and  sustain  U.S.  and  Allied  Forces,  according  to  current  DoD policies and plans. That quantity shall be sufficient to support other U.S. Government Agencies, as applicable. Awaiting  Parts—During  the  repair  process  for  systems/equipment,  parts  are  ordered  for  the system/equipment undergoing repair or an end item is being scheduled for a repair process and parts are ordered for a scheduled repair of the system/equipment to start the repair process. The end item system/equipment undergoing repair/being scheduled for repair is AWP when the parts to  continue  the  repair  process  are  backordered  or  the  scheduled  repair  process  will  exceed mission requirements. Base Condemnation Rate—The number of base condemnations divided by the sum base Repair This Station and base condemnations. Base Consumption Rates—Base consumption rates will be determined by taking the number of failures  at  base level,  over  a specific period of time, divided by the operating program for that same time period. Base Not Repairable this Station Rate—The number of Base NRTS divided by the sum of the base RTS, base NRTS, and base condemnations. Base  Repair  Cycle—The  number  of  days  that  elapse  between  the  time  an  unserviceable reparable item is removed from use and the time it is made serviceable and ready for issue. Base Stock Level—This level is computed in support of the base requisitioning objective. Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources—US Air Force systems consisting of assets formerly known as Harvest Eagle and Harvest Falcon. BEAR Systems are designed to provide minimum essential  troop  cantonment  facilities  (lodging,  field  feeding,  showers,  and  latrines)  and operational  support  (offices,  shops,  limited  shop  equipment,  and  runway  matting).  Units  using AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 249 this equipment are expected to deploy with mobility equipment, vehicles and spares peculiar to their operation in sufficient quantities to allow self-support until resupply is established. Bench  Stocks—Stores  of  ERRC  XB3  items  kept  on-hand  in  a  work  center  to  enhance maintenance productivity. C-Factor—Multiplier of the standard deviation (square root of the variance) of demand during replenishment.  The  materiel  management  system  uses  the  C-factor  to  selectively  increase  item special  level  quantities  for  stocked  items.  The  C-factor  assignment  policy  is  based  on  item mission impact, historical demand, and unit price criteria Calendar Time Change Items—Items requiring replacement at regular intervals as specified in appropriate technical orders. Carcass  Cost—The value of an asset when the LRC plus  BOCR have been removed from  the SP of the item. Carcass cost is also equal to the LAC minus the LRC. Care  of  Supplies  in  Storage—Program  composed of a set of processes and procedures whose purpose  is  to  ensure  that  materiel  in  storage  is  maintained  in  ready-for-issue  condition  or  to prevent uneconomic deterioration of unserviceable materiel. Cataloging—Act of naming, classifying, describing, and numbering each item repetitively used, purchased, stocked, or distributed to distinguish each item from every other item. Also included is the maintenance of information related to the item and the dissemination of that information to item users. Cataloging Tools—The process of initiating and enhancing documents and procedures required to research, record, and organize logistics information. Central Locator—a directory, file, or listing used to provide the location of all stored material. Location  changes  are  manually  entered  onto  the  central  locator.  Maintain  the  central  locator  in current status for use during degraded operations. Central  Procurement—The  purchase  of  materiel,  supplies  or  services  by  an  officially designated  command  or  agency  with  funds  specifically  provided  for  such  procurement  for  the benefit and use of the entire component or the military departments as a whole. Central Secondary Item Stratification—An automated capability that applies to wholesale and retail  asset  and  requirements  data.  The  CSIS  shall  uniformly  display  the  materiel  requirements and  associated  asset  status  of  individual  secondary  items  and  generate  summaries  of  essential information.  If a methodology other than stratification is  used as a  foundation, an audit trail to the applicable stratification table shall be submitted to the USD(L&MR). Secondary item assets shall  be  stratified  at  least  semiannually.  One  stratification  shall  be  as  of  September  30  (for inventory  reporting  and  funding  reviews),  and  the  other  shall  be  as  of  March  31  (for  budget preparation). Classes of Supply—Not to be confused with Federal Supply Class, terminology used to divide supplies  and  equipment  into  10  easily  identifiable  categories  of  materiel  that  are  depicted  by Roman Numerals. Classified  Item—Controlled  inventory  item/materiel  that  require  protection  in  the  interest  of national security. 250 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 Command  Authority—AFI  51-604,  Appointment  to  and  Assumption  of  Command,  identifies command  authority.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  references  to  commander  in  this  publication apply  to  the  mission  commander  at  the  appropriate  level,  i.e.  squadron,  group,  wing,  etc.  Joint Base locations/activities will refer to Joint Basing Implementation Guidance and/or the pertinent Joint Base MOAs for specific guidance on command relationships at that location. Commodity—A homogeneous aggregation of like items. Communications-Electronics—Specialized  field  items  concerned  with  the  use  of  electronic devices  and  systems  for  the  acquisition,  acceptance,  processing,  storage,  display,  analysis, protection, disposition, and transfer of information. Condemnation Requirement—Stock replacements for base and depot condemnations Consumable  Item—Item  of  supply  (except  explosive  ordnance  and  major  end  items  of equipment)  that  is  normally  expended  or  used  up  beyond  recovery  in  the  use  for  which  it  is designed or intended. Minor parts, tools, and hardware identified by ERRC designator XB3. NF1 items  (with  IEX  E,  K)  are  managed  like  consumable  items.  A  consumable  item  cannot  be economically  repaired  by  a  field  or  depot  maintenance  activity.  Accountability  for  consumable items is terminated upon issue. Contingency Retention Stock—CRS is stock above the AAO and above the ERS level, if one exists, that is held to support specific contingencies. Contract  Termination—The  cessation  or  cancellation,  in  whole  or  in  part,  of  work  under  a prime contractor a subcontract for the convenience of, or at the option of, the government, or due to failure of the contractor to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. Controlled  Inventory  Item  Code—Those  items  designated  as  having  characteristics  that require that they be identified, accounted for, secured, segregated, or handled in a special manner to ensure their safeguard or integrity. Control  Level—A  computed  stock  level  the  inventory  management  specialist  or  materiel management  IT  system  uses  when  filling  requisitions.  Non-programmed  requisitions  may  be filled from depot stocks if the asset position is above the control level. Coordination—The  necessary  action  to  ensure  adequate  exchange  of  information  to  integrate, synchronize,  and  deconflict  operations  between  separate  organizations.  Coordination  is  not necessarily  a  process  of  gaining  approval  but  is  most  often  used  for  mutual  exchange  of information. Counterfeit  Materiel—An  item  that  is  an  unauthorized  copy  or  substitute  that  has  been identified, marked, or altered by a source other than the item’s legally authorized source and has been misrepresented to be an authorized item of the legally authorized source. Critical  Safety  Item—Means  a  part,  an  assembly,  installation  equipment,  launch  equipment, recovery equipment, or support equipment for an aircraft or aviation weapon system if the part, assembly,  or  equipment  contains  a  characteristic  any  failure,  malfunction,  or  absence  of  which could  cause  a  catastrophic  or  critical  failure  resulting  in  the  loss  of  or  serious  damage  to  the aircraft  or  weapon  system,  an  unacceptable  risk  of  personal  injury  or  loss  of  life,  or  an uncommanded engine shutdown that jeopardizes safety. AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 251 Customer  Oriented  Leveling  Technique—Used  to  centrally  compute  levels  for  Non  AF-managed items that have an established demand pattern. Daily  Demand  Frequency  Rate—The  DDFR  reflects  the  average  daily  number  of  customer requests  for  an  item.  The  DDFR  differs  from  DDR  in  that  DDFR  is  based  on  the  number  of customer orders (requests), while DDR is based the number of units of stock requested. DDFR is calculated by dividing the sum of customer requests by the number of days since the item’s Date of First Demand (DOFD). Daily  Demand  Rate—Average  quantity  of  an  item  that  is  used  daily.  The  retail  materiel management  system  computes  the  DDR  using  one  of  the  following  methods:  (1)  Bachelor  or Substitute  Item.  Divide  the  item  cumulative  recurring  demand  (CRD)  by  the  difference  of  the current Julian date minus the DOFD. If the demand experience available is less than 180 days, a difference  of  180  mitigates  the  effect  of  limited  demand  experience.  (2)  Master  or Interchangeable  Item.  Divide  the  cumulative  recurring  demand  (CRD)  for  the  master  and  all interchangeable items within the group (for one system designator at a time) by the difference of the current Julian date minus the oldest date of first demand in the master/interchangeable group. If the demand experience available is less than 180 days, a difference of 180 days mitigates the effect of limited demand experience. Data Dissemination—Various products and events provide logistics information to customers at every level of the supply system. Data  Entry  and  Maintenance  Transactions—Those  actions  necessary  to  ensure  complete, accurate  and  current  logistics  data  records  (excluding  item  characteristics  data)  for  an  item  of supply. Defense Inactive Item Program—The systematic elimination of inactive items of supply from DoD materiel management systems and the Federal Catalog System. Defense  Logistics  Agency  Disposition  Services—Field  activity  of  the  DLA  charged  with  the responsibility  of  managing  all  aspects  of  the  process  of  receiving,  storing,  marketing, redistributing,  and  disposing  of  all  materiel  determined  by  elements  of  the  DoD  materiel management structure to be excess to the needs of a DoD activity. Demand—An indication of a requirement (requisition, request, issue, and reparable generation; etc.)  for  issue  of  serviceable  materiel.  Demands  are  categorized  as  either  "recurring"  or "nonrecurring." Demand Level—Stock level for a specific item that is based upon past user demands. Demand-Support Items—Items that are stocked based on forecasted usage. Demand-supported items  are  stocked  with  demand-based  requirements  on  the  basis  of  economics  or  with  limited demand requirements on basis of military mission essentiality. Demilitarization—Act  of  destroying  the  functional  or  military  capabilities  of  certain  types  of equipment  or  material  that  has  been  screened  through  inventory  control  points  and  declared surplus or foreign excess. Items that are subject to demilitarization include defense articles on the United States Munitions List, as provided by Section 38 of the "Arms Export Control Act" (22 CFR  121  (reference  (aj))).

Totally  Redistributable  Materiel—Exists  when  a  base  has  serviceable  shelf  stock  for  items with no historical demand data or base peacetime need (no demand driven or ASL), or when a base has unserviceable assets located in the warehouse. Tanks, Racks, Adapters, and Pylons (TRAP)—Those items of aircraft suspension and release equipment  (S&RE)  and  aircraft fuel  tanks that are subject  to  in-flight  consumption (consumed, jettisoned,  expended,  etc.)  from  the  platform  (aerial  vehicle;  aircraft)  on  which  it  is  installed. Turnaround—The means to record demand data in the materiel management system for either repairs  in  place  or  removal,  repair,  reinstallation  of  a  recoverable  item  without  ordering  a replacement item. Uniform  Materiel  Movement  and  Issue  Priority  System  (UMMIPS)—UMMIPS  sets priorities for the issuance and movement  of materiels.  The system enables supply customers to use  one  of  15  priority  designators  when  requisitioning  supply  items.  These  15  priority designators are based on two components: the UND defines the relative importance of the item ordered to the unit’s mission and the FAD defines the relative importance of the unit placing the order. Reference CJCSI 4100.01E. Unserviceable Asset Price—The price charged to a customer to purchase an unserviceable asset from the ICP. It includes the carcass cost of the unserviceable asset plus the BOCR. UAP is also equal to the SP minus the LRC. Variable  Safety  Level—A  quantity  of  materiel  stored  in  addition  to  the  operating  level  of supply.  It  is  required  to  be  on-hand  to  permit  continuous  operations  in  the  event  of  minor interruption of normal replenishment or unpredictable fluctuations in demand. War  Reserve  Materiel—Consists  of  enterprise  managed,  dynamically  positioned  equipment and  consumables  that  contribute  to  initial  operations  and  provide  initial  support  cross  the  full 262 AFI23-101  12 DECEMBER 2016 range  of  military  operations.  It  enhances  Agile  Combat  Support  capability  to  reduce  the  time required to achieve an operational capability and/or produce an operational effect. Wholesale  Stock—Stock,  regardless  of  funding  sources,  over  which  the  IMM  has  asset knowledge  and  exercises  unrestricted  asset  control  to  meet  worldwide  inventory  management responsibilities. Wholesale—The  highest  level  of  organized  DoD  supply,  and  as  such,  procures,  repairs,  and maintains stocks to resupply the retail levels of supply.
