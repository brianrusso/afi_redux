This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive document identifying life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for the health services specialty.  The CFETP will provide Health Services Management personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.  NOTE:  Civilians occupying associated positions may use Part II to support duty position qualification training.    2.  The CFETP consists of two parts; both parts are used by supervisors to plan, manage, and control training within the career field.   2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains the purpose of the CFETP and how everyone will use the plan.  Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path.  Section C associates each skill level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other).  Section D indicates resource constraints.  Examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities.  Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for the ranks of SSgt through MSgt.   2.2.  Part II contains six sections. At the unit level, supervisors and trainers use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references (TRs) to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, core tasks, and correspondence course requirements.  Section B contains the Course Objective List (COL) and training standards supervisors will use to determine if an Airman has satisfied training requirements.  Section C identifies available support materials.  An example is a Qualification Training Package (QTP) that may be developed to support proficiency training requirements.  Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory and optional courses.  Section E identifies Major Command (MAJCOM) unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.  Training for ARC personnel are identified in this section.  Section F outlines the format and documentation to maintain an AFTR.  3.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career.  This plan enables us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.     4 Abbreviations/Terms Explained  Air Education and Training Command (AETC).

Skill and Career Progression.  Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice through the superintendent skill level play an important role in the AF's ability to accomplish its mission.  It is essential everyone involved in training must do their part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in their career. 2.1.  Apprentice (3-Skill Level).  Non-prior service and ARC students in this specialty will complete the Health Services Management Apprentice course in-residence at METC for award of the 3-skill level.  In accordance to the presidential military initiative, an effort has been made to ensure service members have the opportunity to obtain civilian certifications that can be used for military occupational specialties. The decision to train specific task and knowledge items included in the STS is based on the National Healthcareer Association (NHA) Certified Electronic Health Record Specialist (CEHRS) certification.  Students are required to challenge the CEHRS certification exam prior to graduating the Health Services Management Apprentice course.  However, the successful achievement of the CEHRS certification exam is not required to be awarded 3-skill level.  After completion of this course and upon arrival at the first duty assignment, the apprentice will work with a trainer to enhance knowledge and skills.  The apprentice will enter UGT using CDCs and task qualification training to progress in the career field.  Once certified on a task, the apprentice may perform the task unsupervised.  NOTE: Retrainees will upgrade via OJT and units are strongly recommended to contact the Health Services Management Course for study material.  However, if seats are available, course attendance is strongly recommended.  2.2.  Journeyman (5-Skill Level).  Individuals must successfully complete the 5-skill level CDC before being upgraded to the 5-skill level.  Once upgraded, journeymen enter into continuation training to broaden their experience base.  Journeymen will attend the Airman Leadership School (ALS) after 48 months in the Air Force, or sooner, if selected for promotion to Staff Sergeant.  After ALS, journeymen can perform duties as trainers and supervisors and be considered for appointment as unit trainers.  To enhance their skills, they are encouraged to continue their education toward a Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) degree and complete a specialty certification to enhance their skills and value as a 4A0.  2.3.  Craftsman (7-Skill Level).  A craftsman must successfully complete the 7-skill level CDC(s) before upgrade to the 7-skill level.  Once upgraded, a craftsman can expect to fill various supervisory and management positions, such as noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC), supervisor, program manager, and task trainer or certifier.  Craftsman will attend the Noncommissioned Officer Academy (NCOA) after selection for promotion to Technical Sergeant (Active Duty only).  Continued academic education through CCAF and higher degree programs is encouraged.  2.4.  Superintendent (9-Skill Level).  Before attaining the 9-skill level, individuals must be promoted to Senior Master Sergeant (AD only).  A superintendent can expect to fill positions  15 such as flight chief, superintendent, functional manager, and various staff positions.  Additional training in the areas of resources, leadership skills, and management should be pursued through continuing education.  Completion of higher degree programs is highly recommended.  2.5.  Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) 4A000.  Awarded after promotion to Chief Master Sergeant.  A CEM can expect to fill positions such as functional manager at various command levels, group or squadron superintendent, and flight chief.  Additional training in the areas of resources, leadership skills, and management should continue. Completion of higher degree programs is highly recommended. 2.6.  Proficiency Training.  Any additional knowledge and skill requirements, which were not taught through initial skills, supplemental, or upgrade training.  The purpose of the continuation-training program is to provide additional training exceeding minimum upgrade training requirements with emphasis on present and future duty positions.  MFMs and MTF Functional Managers (FM) must develop a continuation-training program that ensures individuals receive the necessary training at the appropriate point in their career.  The training program will identify both mandatory and optional training requirements.  AETC will assist in this continuation training development wherever possible, by providing instructional system design/development expertise and media selection options.  2.7.  RSV Training Requirements.  Training is conducted through web-based courseware on specific tasks listed in the STS.  Tasks are identified with an R in column 4D of the STS.  Training tasks, which are identified in the RSV database, are the catalyst for training program development. Supervisors are required to annotate the member's initial RSV training completion in AFTR.  Subsequent RSV training or readiness-related training completion will be documented and maintained in MRDSS ULTRA for reporting/tracking purposes.  Supervisors and/or members can request an electronic print out of RSV completion from their unit FM and/or unit Medical Readiness flight.  NOTE:  RSV training will also be supplemented with hands-on skill training to reinforce preparedness.  2.8.  Training for UTC Requirements.  All 4A0X1s assigned to deployable UTCs will complete UTC-specific training, field training, and other requirements as directed in AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Program Management.  Training for these tasks normally will be conducted via medical unit readiness training, field training, readiness exercises, or annual ancillary unit training.  2.9.  Other Training.  Units will establish appropriate 4A0 training to meet unit-specific disaster response training. Generally, this training should include duties associated with TRICARE Operations, Medical Contingency Response Team Training, Aeromedical Evacuation, PRP, HIT, and general duties.  2.10.  Special Experience Identifier (SEI). SEIs are established to identify special experience and training not otherwise identified within the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS). SEIs complement the assignment process, but are not substitutes for AFSCs, CEM codes, prefixes, suffixes, Special Duty Identifiers (SDIs), Reporting Identifiers (RIs), or professional specialty course codes. They are established when identifying training, skills, or experience as critical to the assignment match, or force management needs and no other identification is appropriate or available. SEIs can be used to rapidly identify an already experienced resource to meet unique  16 circumstances, contingency requirements or management needs. They provide a means to track individuals and identify positions requiring or providing unique experience or training that would otherwise be lost.  2.10.1.  SEI 260, Information Assurance Technical Level 1.  Requires (1) assignment to perform information assurance technical support at the computing environment level (example: Client Support Administrator); (2) certification as A+, Network+ or System Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP); (3) recommendation of unit commander.

There are additional SEIs listed in the AFECD that any AFSC can obtain, to include SEI 005 and AFSO21 Level I Certification, which are strongly encouraged for 4A0s to attain.  3.  Training Decisions.  The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Health Services Management career field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  Training decisions are made during the 4A0X1 U&TW, held at the discretion of the 4A0X1 CFM.  3.1.  Initial Skills.  There were significant changes to the 3-skill level course for AFSC 4A0X1.  Most notably was the development and consolidation of an Army and AF training platform.  Changes incorporated in the merged program include training in such areas as TRAC2ES, MEDEVAC, ICD-9/10 Coding, and DHMRSi.  These additions support the joint doctrine principles fostering interoperability in the deployed environment.  Students will continue to interact in scenarios to enhance the realism and application of tasks. Students are awarded the 3-skill level upon completion of the basic course.  3.2.  5-Skill Level.  The existing CDC was reviewed to ensure only current material remained and new procedures and duties were added. Major changes were made to Systems and Readiness duties and responsibilities. The number of volumes for the 5-skill level CDC decreased from 5 to 4 volumes.  3.3.  7-Skill Level.  The 7-skill level CDC training requirements were reviewed and updated. The number of volumes for the 7-skill level CDC increased from 1 to 2. Readiness tasks were expanded to include the 9-line.   4.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).  CCAF is one of several federally chartered degree-granting institutions; however, it is the only 2-year institution exclusively serving military enlisted personnel. The college is regionally accredited through Air University by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degrees designed for specific Air Force occupational specialties and is the largest multi-campus community college in the world. Upon completion of basic military training and assignment to an AF career field, all enlisted personnel are registered in a CCAF degree program and are afforded the opportunity to obtain an AAS degree. In order to be awarded, degree requirements must be successfully completed before the student separates from the Air Force, retires, or is commissioned as an officer. See the CCAF website for details regarding the AAS degree programs.   18 4.1.  Degree Requirements.  All enlisted Airmen are automatically entered into the CCAF program. Prior to completing an associate degree, the 5-level must be awarded and the following requirements must be met:       Technical Education...................................................................................24 Leadership, Management, and Military Studies ..........................................6 Physical Education .......................................................................................4 General Education ........................................................................………15* Program Elective ......................................................................................15* Total: 64 Semester Hours    *Note: The Health Care Management degree requires 18 semester hours (SH) of general education (addition of a 3 SH general education elective) and 12 SH of program elective.  4.1.1.  Technical Education (24 semester hours).  A minimum of 12 semester hours of Technical Core subject or course must be applied and the remaining semester hours applied from technical core or technical electives subjects or courses.  Requests to substitute comparable courses or to exceed specified semester hour values in any subject or course must be approved in advance by Air University.  Semester hours for skill level completion are applied as follows: 14 hours for 3-skill level, 8 hours for 5-skill level, and 4 hours for 7-skill level.  The 2 remaining semester hours may be rolled over into program electives.    4.1.2.  Leadership, Management, and Military Studies (6 Semester Hours).  Professional military education and/or civilian management courses.  4.1.3.  Physical Education (4 Semester Hours).  This requirement is satisfied by completion of Basic Military Training.  4.1.4.

Implementation.  The STS will be used for technical training provided by METC for the 3-skill level Education and Training Apprentice course with the class beginning no earlier than October 2015.  The 4A051 CDC need date (date the CDC should be available to the field) is 1 Feb 2015 with an activation date of 19 May 15. The 4A071 CDC need date is 15 Nov 2015. All other portions are effective immediately upon publication.  2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, the STS:  2.1.  Lists in Column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airmen to perform duties in the 3, 5, and 7-skill level. Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies the core task requirements.  Core task requirements are met after individuals successfully complete the appropriate upgrade training for their skill level, the 3-skill level course (L8ABJ4A031 01AA, Health Services Management Apprentice Course), the entire 4A051 CDC and the entire 4A071 CDC.  2.2.  Provides certification for OJT.  Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements. Use the automated  AFTR to document technician qualifications.   2.3.  Qualitative Requirements.  Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.  2.4.  Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements.  Columns 4A, 4B and 4C are used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and the CDC. Training for these tasks is achieved through OJT and completion of appropriate CDC.  Column 4D identifies RSV tasks.  Primary methods are web-based training and frequency is on a 24-month cycle.  Units are encouraged to incorporate hands-on training to supplement and verify proficiency.  2.5.  The STS serves as a JQS for OJT when placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Form, and used according to AFI 36-2201. When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:    2.5.1.  Documentation.  Document and certify completion of training in accordance with AFI 36-2201.  Identify duty position requirements by circling the subparagraph number next to the task statement.  As a minimum, complete the following columns in Part 2 of the CFETP: Start Date, Training Completed, Trainee Initials, Trainer Initials, Certifier Initials (if applicable).  An AFJQS may be used in lieu of Part II of the CFETP only upon approval of the AFCFM. NOTE: The AFCFM may supplement these minimum documentation procedures as needed or deemed necessary for their career field.   2.5.2. Transcribing to new CFETP.  Transcribing documentation to a new CFETP is an administrative function, not a re-evaluation of training. Upon publication of a new CFETP, transcribe IAW AFI 36-2201.  28  2.5.2.1.  For tasks previously certified and still required in the current duty position, enter the current date in the completion column, trainee initials in the trainee column, and the current task certifier or supervisor/trainer initials in the trainer column.  2.5.2.2.  For tasks previously certified but not required in the current duty position, transcribe only the previous certification dates (no initials).  If the task later becomes required in the duty position, recertify using current dates and initials.    2.5.2.3.  Annotate the AF Form 623a, (for example, ―I certify the information contained in the CFETP dated XX was transcribed to the CFETP dated XX, and the trainee was given the superseded CFETP.‖ Signed and dated by the supervisor and trainee).  2.5.3.  Documenting Career Knowledge.  When a CDC is not available, the supervisor identifies STS training references the trainee requires for career knowledge and ensures, at a minimum, the trainees cover mandatory items in the Enlisted Classification Directory. For two-time CDC course exam failures, See AFI 36-220, Air Force Training Program, for specific instructions. NOTE: Career knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver.  2.5.4.  Decertification.  When an Airman is found to be unqualified on a task previously certified for his or her position, the supervisor utilizes the decertification feature found in AFTR.  Then appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form 623a, documenting the reason for decertification. See AFI 36-2201 for specific instructions.  2.5.5.  Training Standard.  Trainees are trained, evaluated, and certified to the go/no-go level.  Go means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures. Supervisors and superintendents will manage this process by assessing 4A051 qualifications.  2.5.5.1.  Trainers must be recommended by their supervisors, qualified to perform the task being trained and have completed the AF Training Course.  2.5.5.2.  Certifiers must be at least a Staff Sergeant, capable of evaluating the task being certified, be someone other than the trainer, and complete the Air Force Training Course.  Possession of at least a 7-skill level is desired, but not required.  2.6. The Training Standard is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  Specialty Knowledge Tests are developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron by SNCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog.  WAPS is only applicable to AD forces.  3.  Recommendations.  Identify inadequacies and recommend changes to this training standard through channels at 937 TRG/TGE, 2931 Harney Rd, Fort Sam Houston, Texas 78234-7674 or use the Customer Service Information Line (CSIL) at DSN 420-1080, commercial 210-808-1080, or email usaf.jbsa.937-trg.list.937-trg-tge@mail.mil to report your findings.  29          BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE       OFFICIAL    MARK A.

Stakeholder expectations require astute management of the delivery organizations in the MHS, along with the formulation of policy at all levels that support corporate goals. Data-driven decision-making is key to successful performance.  This 40-hour course reviews the basic processes of management decision making, with emphasis on the use and limitations of contemporary Military Health System (MHS) data and data systems.  Although the course uses examples set in a typical MTF integrated delivery system, the concepts and tools are equally applicable for other decision-makers, entities, and command levels in the MHS.  The target audience for this course is novice to mid-level ARS Bridge (M2) users who use MHS data for analysis.   1.1.11.  TRICARE Financial Management Education Program (TFMEP) Basic Course. TMA presents the TFMEP as a means to provide training on current and evolving TRICARE financial management subject areas.

This lesson provides background information for all primary participants using the TRAC2ES system.  Upon completion, students will have an understanding of the use and function of the TRAC2ES Automated Information System (AIS) and its relationship to the patient movement process.  TRAC2ES Enterprise refers to the umbrella system that includes an AIS and non-automated (non-AIS or manual) tasks to support patient movement.  The TRAC2ES mission is to link originating and destination MTFs with medical evacuation conveyances and C2 infrastructure to maintain continuous global awareness and management of the patient movement system.  It will be used the same way in peace, contingencies, or war.  This training focuses on the TRAC2ES AIS, but also includes some non-AIS tasks.  You may contact GPMRC for a copy of the TRAC2ES CBT CD-ROM.    1.1.12.2.
