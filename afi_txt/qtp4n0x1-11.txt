These qualification-training packages (QTPs) were developed to enhance on-the-job training (OJT) for Allergy/Immunology technicians (SEI 453).  They provide for you, as a trainer, the breakdown of tasks into teachable elements.  This will help you guide the trainee toward gaining enough proficiency to perform the tasks.  They will also aid task certifiers when it becomes necessary to evaluate trainees for task certification.  2.  As a trainer, go through each module and identify which QTPs are needed for the trainee’s job position.  You also have the flexibility to arrange training for each module in the order you decide.  Review the different tasks related to the subject area in each module with the trainee.  Direct the trainee to review the training references to better understand the objective of each module.  If the trainee has any questions about the objective, clarify what is expected based on the objective of the module.  Go through the performance checklist with the trainee and allow enough time to learn each step (some objectives may take longer to teach).  Remember, the objective of each QTP is to allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly.  When the trainee receives enough training and is ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluation instructions.  Use the performance checklist as you evaluate each objective.  If the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document appropriately in the Air Force Training Record (AFTR).  If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, go over the areas needing more training until the objective is met.  Conduct a feedback with the trainee on each module.  Once you, as the trainer, have ensured that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, a certifier will then evaluate him/her.  3.  The goal of the developers of each QTP is to publish a usable document for trainers and trainees that will benefit the CFETP concept of training throughout your career.  We value your expertise in meeting this goal.  If you find discrepancies in a QTP, or if you have suggestions for improvement or additional QTP development, please let us know about them.    4.
