Purpose.  This  chapter  contains  general  information  about  Defense  Joint  Military  Pay System (DJMS) that applies to all input sources outside the Financial Service Office (FSO). 1.2.  Supporting  Documents.  Actions  affecting  a  member's  Master  Military  Pay  Account (MMPA)  must  be  supported  by  legible  documentation.  This  consists  of  signed  and  certified documents  completely  explaining  each  transaction.  Source  documentation  also  includes transactions  that  do  not  affect  pay  and  allowances  but  are  required  in  DJMS  to  maintain  a member's MMPA. 1.2.1.  DJMS requires source documents for all transactions to support changes to the MMPA         and to clear rejected and suspended items listed on the daily register of transactions (DROT) for control purposes. The four types of source documents are: 1.2.1.1.  Regular Source Documents - Authorize and support changes in entitlements and deductions on a MMPA. 1.2.1.2.  Miscellaneous Source Documents - Authorize changes to a MMPA which do not involve entitlements and deductions. Examples are changes to payment option and taxing authority. 1.2.1.3.  Military Leave Documents - See Chapter 7. 1.2.1.4.  Administrative  Source  Documents  -  Used  to  change  member's  address,  and organization code in the central-site JBIT file. 1.2.2.  Disposition.  Send original of supporting documents to FSO. 1.3.  Input  Source  Code.  FSO  assigns  a  two-position  alphanumeric  input  source  code  to  each activity authorized to prepare and submit DJMS documentation. Use this code on AF Form 1373, MPO Document Control Log - Transmittal, as well as on each DJMS supporting document when submitting source documents to the FSO. Put the source code in the upper right hand corner of the documents. 1.4.  Transmission  of  Documents  to  FSO.  Each  input  source  transmits  original  source documents to the FSO daily. Use AF Form 1373 for transmittal  of  all  documents  except  leave  and    send    original    AF    Form    1373    with    source  documents  to  the  FSO;  keep  a  copy  in suspense  awaiting  acknowledgment  of  receipt  by  FSO  through  an  entry  on  the  DROT.    AF Forms 1373 are sequentially numbered by the input source. FSOs may, if they wish, require the input source to renumber AF Forms 1373 at the beginning of each fiscal year. When transmitting multiple  Military  Pay  Orders  to  the  FSO,  the  AF  Form  1373  can  be  annotated  "See  Attached" and include number of documents attached. 1.5.  Filing of Source Documents.  Keep a suspense copy of every source document. Attach this copy  to  the  DROT  and  keep  for  reference  and  audit.  Each  input  source  makes  sure  there  is  a properly certified document in suspense for each transaction appearing on the DROT. Notify the FSO  of  any  transaction  appearing  on  the  DROT  for  which  you  do  not  have  proper documentation. Follow-up to  determine processing status  of any source documents in  suspense  6 AFMAN65-116V2  18 JULY 2017 which have not  been acknowledged within five  workdays by an  entry on the DROT. Retain as specified in Air Force Records Disposition Schedule. 1.6.  Inquiries.  Direct members to Air Force Portal to view AFAFO Virtual Finance page where they can locate Frequently Asked Questions.   If the member is not able to locate an answer on the portal they can call or visit the customer service counter of the servicing FSO. 1.7.  Rejects.  Data entering DJMS is subjected to base-level and DFAS edits to make sure only acceptable and valid data is used to update the MMPA. Incorrect or invalid data is not accepted and  is  rejected  from  the  system.  Finance  personnel  review  all  rejects  and  management  notices. They determine action required, and when applicable, correct and resubmit the transaction. Any document  rejected  back  to  an  input  source  that  is  resubmitted  must  be  included  on  a  new  AF Form 1373. 1.8.  Input List.  The term "DROT" is used to describe the list of input transactions produced by DJMS-AC. 1.8.1.  Content. Input list is produced for each input source and shows: 1.8.1.1.  Base-level processed transactions. 1.8.1.2.  Rejected transactions. 1.9.  FAX/Email.  When servicing FSO is at a different location from a unit, DJMS data may be transmitted by: 1.9.1.  FAX:  Faxing  of  documents  for  processing  into  DJMS  is  permissible.  Units  should contact  their  FSO  for  the  FAX  telephone  number.  AF  Form  1373  should  be  used  as  the transmittal document. Follow-up with original documents is not required unless requested by servicing FSO under special circumstances. 1.9.2.  Email:  When  sending  documents  via  Email,  ensure  Personally  Identifiable Information  (PII) is  held to  a minimum  and is  safeguarded.  Ensure  email  is  encrypted and Privacy  Act  notice  and  For  Official  Use  Only  (FOUO)  headers  are  used  on  the  Email.  Include an AF Form 1373 with the scanned documents attached to the Email. 1.9.3.  myPay:  Members  may  submit  various  changes  to  their  MMPA  via  myPay.  These include  tax  withholding  changes,  address  changes,  direct  deposit  account  changes  and allotments. or https://mypay.dfas.mil/mypay.aspx. into  myPay Portal Air Force via the  Log 1.9.4.  CMS: Case Management System.  Units may submit documents via CMS to the FSO or Force Support Squadron (FSS).  AFMAN65-116V2  18 JULY 2017 7 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.  Purpose.  This chapter defines responsibilities of organizations and individuals outside the FSO who are involved in DJMS input. 2.2.  Certifying  Officers.  Certifying  officers  provide  certified  substantiating  documents  to  the servicing FSO.  An example is a document for assignment of government quarters. Certification establishes that the facts stated in supporting documents are correct. Certifying officers base the certification on personal knowledge of facts acquired during performance of their duty. 2.3.  Departmental  Accountable  Officials  .  Personnel  who  provide  data,  services,  or information upon which a certifying officer relies upon to  certify a pay-affecting document are considered departmental accountable officials (DAOs). DAOs are pecuniary liable for improper payments  resulting  from  their  negligence.  This  means  the  government  can  look  to  the  DAO  to repay all monies lost resulting from negligence in the performance of their duties. 2.4.  Geographically Separated Unit (GSU).  A GSU submits substantiating documents daily to their servicing FSO when such documents affect pay and allowances, leave, and other data in the MMPA. 2.5.  Member.  The member assists in updating the MMPA by providing the responsible office with  all  the  information  and  documents  necessary  and  or  required  to  support  pay-affecting recertification and updates or changes related to the member or the member’s dependents. 2.6.  Commander:  Unit  Commander  or  other  individual  on  G-Series  Orders  with  command responsibility for the member. In addition to their command responsibilities, they are responsible for  authorizing  certain  financial  entitlements  for  the  members  under  their  command.  Those responsibilities include, but are not limited to: 2.6.1.  Authorizing or certifying the number of meals missed. 2.6.2.  Annually  verifying  the  BAS  entitlements  of  enlisted  members  who  are  not  under blanket authority or are below pay grade E-5. 2.6.3.  Approving requests for advance of pay and allowances. 2.6.4.  Verifying members’ continued entitlement to special duty pays and incentive pays. 2.6.5.

Preparing  reinstatement  letters  for  members  whose  with-dependent  rate  BAH entitlement has been stopped because the recertification statements were returned to the FSO late. The commander must certify, when appropriate, that failure to recertify timely was for reasons  beyond  the  member’s  control  (see  JTR  Chapter  10).  In  these  cases,  the  member’s higher rate of BAH will be restarted, effective the day after the stop date. 2.7.  Installation/Wing  Commander.  Fully  supports  financial  services  operations  through ensuring  all  personnel  are  briefed  on  DJMS,  ensuring  coordination  between  staff  agencies  for accurate and timely flow of documents to the servicing finance office, and appointing certifying officers.  8 AFMAN65-116V2  18 JULY 2017 2.8.

Procedures when LeaveWeb is not used: 7.1.1.  Commander: 7.1.1.1.  Establishes  and  controls  leave  administration  within  the  unit.  This  should include  designating  a  primary  and  alternate  leave  monitor  in  writing.  Units  must  have access to current AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program. 7.1.1.2.  Receives monthly leave balance listing. Uses the leave balance listing to control the  approval  of  advance,  excess,  and  terminal  leave.  The  leave  balance  listing  may  be used to develop and update projected leave schedules. 7.1.1.3.  Approves  advance,  excess,  and  terminal  leave.  Refer  to  AFI  36-3003  for requirements on approving Advance, Excess and Terminal Leave. 7.1.1.4.  While  commanders  have  the  final  authority  to  approve,  disapprove,  or  extend leave, the authority usually is delegated to the lowest supervisory level according to the needs of the organization. If delegated, the leave approval authority should be at the level where it is easy to check the physical presence or absence of the member during normal duty hours. The authority to grant convalescent leave rests with the Unit Commander (or acting Unit Commander) and may not be delegated. 7.1.2.  Supervisor Leave Approval Authority: 7.1.2.1.  Verifies leave balance from current Leave and Earning Statement (LES) or unit leave balance listing.  NOTE:  Safeguard member’s privacy data, supervisor should only verify member’s name on LES and leave balance. Member should fold the LES in such a manner that the leave-approving official can view only the information pertaining to the member's  leave  balance.    Supervisor  or  designee  obtains  (or  has  obtained)  a  leave authorization  number  from  the  unit  commander’s  support  staff  immediately  before signing  a  leave  approval  and  forwarding  Part  1  of  the  AF  Form  988,  Leave Request/Authorization,  to  the  Financial  Services  Office  (FSO).  Leave  authorization numbers  may  be  obtained  telephonically  or  by  electronic  means.  NOTE:  (If  supervisor disapproves  leave,  there  is  no  need  to  obtain  the  leave  authorization  number).  Leave approving  officials  may  designate  someone  other  than  the  person  requesting  leave  to obtain  the  leave  authorization  number  for  them.  Supervisor  either  approves  or disapproves leave and processes requests for supervised members. NOTE:  Approval for excess, advance, or terminal leave must be made by level of Commander specified in AFI 36-3003.  Once  the  leave-approving  official  has  approved  the  leave,  they  should immediately forward part  I to the FSO. Part I is not returned to the member or given to the Unit Leave Monitor to submit to the FSO. 7.1.2.2.  If the leave approval authority is at a geographically separated location from the member, making it impractical  for the supervisor to  physically  sign the leave form, use the following procedures:  AFMAN65-116V2  18 JULY 2017 33 7.1.2.2.1.  Member  requests  the  leave  telephonically  or  by  electronic  means  and  the supervisor  sends  an  email  to  the  member's  location  indicating  leave  approval  or disapproval.  Fax may also be used, ensure protection of Privacy Act information. 7.1.2.2.2.  The email is used in lieu of the supervisor's signature block on Part I of AF Form 988 and a copy of the email is attached to Part I of AF Form 988. 7.1.2.3.  Advises  the  FSO  and  unit  when  a  member  fails  to  return  from  leave  when scheduled. 7.1.2.4.  Provides information to unit to satisfy rejects received when required. 7.1.2.5.  Certifies AF Form 988 Part III upon member's return. In consideration of the last day  of  duty  before  starting  leave,  and  including  all  other  available  information,  the supervisor  certifies  that  the  dates  of  leave  are  true  and  correct  to  the  best  of  their knowledge and belief. General officers may certify their own period of leave upon return from  leave.  The  email,  fax,  or  telephone  contact  used  for  notification  of  return  from leave, should be entered in the Supervisor's Signature block. NOTE: The definition of the word  "supervisor"  for  the  purposes  of  certifying  AF  Form  988  Part  III  upon  member's return  includes  the  next  available  person  in  the  member's  chain  of  command  having knowledge  of  the  facts  in  cases  where  it  is  impractical  to  obtain  actual  supervisor's signature. 7.1.2.6.  Completing the AF Form 988, Leave Request/Authorization: 7.1.2.6.1.  Blocks  1  through  5,  9,  12  through  21,  and  23  through  25  are  self- explanatory. 7.1.2.6.2.  Block 6. Current Leave Balance. Verify that the member has enough leave balance to  cover the period of leave requested. Check the member's LES or the unit commander’s support staff leave balance listing. Complete 6a when member requests leave with a planned return date within 30 days of date of separation (DOS). 7.1.2.6.3.  Block  7.  Recommend  Convalescent  Leave.  This  block  is  completed, signed,  and  stamped  by  the  appropriate  medical  authority  if  convalescent  leave  is recommended. 7.1.2.6.4.  Block  8.  For  permissive  temporary  duty  (PTDY),  state  the  paragraph number of the applicable reason for PTDY as stated in AFI 36-3003 and in Remarks area give abbreviated description of purpose of PTDY. 7.1.2.6.5.  Block 10.  Leave Authorization Number. Supervisor or designee obtains  a leave authorization number from the unit immediately before approving the leave and forwarding Part  I to  the FSO. Do not  obtain the number earlier than 30 days before the leave effective date (including terminal leaves). 7.1.2.6.6.  Block 11. First Day/Time of Leave Status. If member departs on leave on a non-duty day, enter the non-duty date and 0001 hours. If the member departs on leave on a duty day  without performing the majority  (more than 50 percent) of scheduled duty,  enter  the  date  and  0001  hours.  If  the  member  departs  on  leave  on  a  duty  day after performing the majority (more than 50 percent) of scheduled duty, enter the date and time released from duty. NOTE: Leave status is not necessarily chargeable leave.  34 AFMAN65-116V2  18 JULY 2017 Member can’t sign up for space-available transportation before date and time in this block. Date cannot be more than one day before the date in block 12. 7.1.2.6.7.  Block 22. For PTDY, use approval level in AFI 36-3003. 7.1.2.6.8.  Blocks  26-33.  These  blocks  are  completed  only  if  leave  is  advance  or excess.  Since  unit  commanders  only  are  authorized  to  approve  advance  or  excess leave,  block  22  should  not  be  completed  except  be  the  unit  commander;  however, member's supervisor/leave approval authority should complete blocks 21, 23, 24, and 25, along with other blocks according to 1 and 2. Blocks are self-explanatory except for block 27 and 28. 7.1.2.6.9.  Block  27.  Advance  Leave.  If  the  requested  leave  exceeds  the  current balance,  but  does  not  exceed  the  balance  to  expiration  term  of  service  (ETS),  the leave is advance leave. Complete blocks 26 and 27 and forward the form (all parts) to the  unit  commander  for  approval.  If  a  member  requesting  leave  has  a  cumulative advance balance over 30 days, comply with AFI 36-3003. 7.1.2.6.10.  Block  28.  Excess  Leave.  If  the  requested  leave  exceeds  the  balance  to ETS, the leave is excess leave. Complete blocks 26 through 28, and forward the form (all parts) to the unit commander for approval. 7.1.2.7.  Distribution of AF Form 988: 7.1.2.7.1.  Part  I.  Immediately  after  first  obtaining  a  leave  authorization  number followed  by  signing  AF  Form  988,  forward  Part  1  to  the  FSO  through  normal distribution channels unless the leave is terminal  or separation or involves excess or advance  leaves.  Forward  these  leaves  (all  parts)  to  the  Commander  for  approval.  If approved, unit returns Parts II and III to the supervisor, except that Part III is retained by the unit for terminal or separation leaves. 7.1.2.7.2.  Part II. Give Part II to the member. Instructions are self-explanatory. 7.1.2.7.3.  Part III. Hold Part III for completion after the member's return from leave. If member requests cancellation before any leave has been taken, complete section III of Part III and forward to the unit. 7.1.2.8.  Completing Part III of AF Form 988 After Member's Return From Leave. Upon member's return from leave, determine how the member's actual leave dates compared to the chargeable leave reported to the FSO on Part I. Complete section III and immediately forward Part III to the unit on member's first duty day after return from leave. If you must alter  any  section  III  data  after  initially  completing,  single  line  through  and  initial  the incorrect  data  or  block.  Immediately  forward  Part  III  to  the  unit  for  prompt  processing and correction of the member's leave account balance where appropriate. 7.1.2.9.  Leave Date Adjustments and Extensions: 7.1.2.9.1.  If  member  departs  before  or  after  the  first  day  of  chargeable  leave indicated in section I of parts I and III, complete part III, section III, by marking the should  be  corrected  box  in  item  A  and  completing  items  B  through  E  on  AF  Form 988.  AFMAN65-116V2  18 JULY 2017 35 7.1.2.9.2.  For  an  extension  of  one  or  more  days,  complete  AF  Form  988  Part  III, section  III,  by  marking  the  "SHOULD  BE  CORRECTED"  box  in  item  A  and completing items B through E. Sign Part III and forward to the unit. 7.1.3.  Unit:  NOTE:  in  the  Air  National  Guard  (ANG),  these  tasks  are  performed  in  the comptroller's office for members on active duty under Title 32 U.S.C.: 7.1.3.1.  Establishes and maintains AF Form 1486, Unit Leave Control Log. 7.1.3.2.  Compares  number  of  days'  leave  requested  against  the  balance  shown  on  the leave  balance  listing.  If  advance  leave  or  excess  leave  is  involved,  the  leave  must  be approved by the commander. 7.1.3.3.  Receives  Daily  Register  of  Transactions  (DROT)  from  the  FSO  daily.  When requested, the unit provides information to the FSO to satisfy rejected leave transactions. 7.1.3.4.  The unit must make sure all leave authorization numbers released to supervisors or leave-approving officials are processed by the FSO. The date the leave request appears on  the  DROT  must  be  posted  to  the  unit leave  control  log.  The  unit  must  follow  up  on any  leave  authorization  numbers,  which  have  been  released  or  used,  but  which  do  not appear  on  the  DROT  within  six  workdays  from  the  date  the  number  was  issued.  FSOs may  extend  the  follow-up  period  for  geographically  separated  units  when  warranted  by local  conditions.  Additionally,  verify  that  all  leave  dates,  and  the  number  of  days  leave charged match the entries in the unit leave control log. If leave type was recorded on the AF Form 1486, also check leave type on the DROT. Resolve any discrepancies with the FSO. 7.1.4.  AF Form 988 Procedures: 7.1.4.1.  Part  I.  For  most  leaves,  member's  supervisor  forwards  this  copy  to  the  FSO immediately  after  first  obtaining  leave  authorization  number  from  the  unit  and  then approving leave. 7.1.4.2.  Part II. Member's Copy. Section II issued to record data for a leave originating outside CONUS and return. Instructions to the member are on the member's copy. 7.1.4.3.  Part  III.  For  most  leaves,  supervisor  retains  Part  III  until  the  member  returns from leave, then completes Section III and forwards to the unit on the member's first duty day after return from leave. On receipt of Part III, the unit annotates the AF Form 1486 and either retains Part III or forwards it to the FSO for additional processing. Forward to the FSO for document submission. If member requests change of one or more days leave (either at the beginning or end of the leave period), supervisor indicates on AF Form 988, part  III,  section  III,  that  leave  should  be  corrected  and  forwards  to  the  unit. IMPORTANT:  Because  most  leave  is  charged  on  a  member's  anticipated  return  date, units must immediately forward Part III to the FSO, where appropriate, so that the FSO may promptly adjust any leave which requires correction. 7.1.5.  Exception Processing: 7.1.5.1.  Terminal  Leave.  All  parts  are  forwarded  to  the  FSO  for  assignment  of  a  leave authorization  number,  or  leave  authorization  number  can  be  obtained  by  phone  or  by electronic  means.  Parts  II  and  III  are  returned  for  distribution  of  Part  II  to  the  member, and retention of Part III in suspense.  36 AFMAN65-116V2  18 JULY 2017 7.1.5.2.  Advance and Excess Leave (Other than Appellate Review Leave). All parts are forwarded  to  the  Commander  for  approval  before  submission  of  Part  I  to  the  FSO.  For excess  leaves  only,  handprint  on  Part  III  in  one  inch  red  letters,  "excess  leave".  Return Parts II and III to member's supervisor for normal completion. 7.1.5.3.  Appellate Review Leave. All parts are forwarded to the FSO for assignment of a leave authorization number, or leave authorization number can be obtained by phone or by electronic means. Parts II and III are returned for distribution of part II to the member, and retention of Part III in suspense. 7.1.6.  AF  Form  1486  Procedures.  The  unit  leave  monitor  maintains  this  form  to  issue  and control  leave  authorization  numbers  and  to  record  leave  transaction  processing  from  the DROT.  For  terminal  leaves  and  appellate  review  leaves  only,  the  FSO  issues  the  leave authorization number and the FSO alone records processing of the leave on AF Form 1486. 7.1.6.1.  Issuing  Leave  Numbers.  Complete  the  first  five  blocks  from  the  left  margin, including  the  "remarks"  block  if  additional  information  is  needed,  that  is,  emergency address,  number  of  day’s  leave,  type  of  leave,  etc.  Under  the  Part  I  column,  enter  the "issue  date  of  the  authorization  number  plus  six  workdays,"  and  the  projected  "return date" (last date of chargeable leave) plus three workdays in the appropriate blocks. Leave authorization  numbers  are  not  assigned  or  released  more  than  30  days  before  the  leave effective  date.  For  the  purpose  of  determining  follow-up  dates  on  AF  Form  1486  only, use FSO workdays rather than unit workdays if FSO and unit workdays are different. 7.1.6.2.  Part  I  Processing  (Part  I  Column).  For  most  leaves,  enter  the  date  of  SB01 processing. If Part I is received by the FSO after the member returns from leave, an SB03 may be processed. 7.1.6.3.  Part III Processing (Part III Column). On receipt of Part III, enter the date of Part III  receipt  on  the  "Date  Part  III  Received"  line.  If  Part  III  indicates  "no  change,"  no further  data  is  entered  in  this  column,  and  Part  III  is  retained  for  attachment  to  the completed block assignment package. If the leave requires "cancellation," or "correction," enter either "cancel," or "correct," respectively in the second block, and immediately send Part  III  to  the  FSO  for  processing.  For  all  leave  area  "overseas"  (OS)  or  "overseas  to CONUS"  (OS  to  CONUS)  over  30  days,  enter  "Correct"  in  Part  III  column  and immediately send Part III to the FSO. For leaves requiring correction, postdate of SB05 processing.  For  canceled  leaves,  post  the  date  of  SB06  processing.  Important:  Since leave suspense notices do not appear on the DROT, it is critical that unit leave monitors promptly  post  daily  DROT  transaction  data  to  the  AF  Form  1486  and  follow-up  to supervisor and, or FSO for late or lost leaves as specified below. 7.1.6.4.  Follow-up procedures Part I. Follow-up to member's supervisor and FSO for any Part  I  for  which  an SB01 does not  clear the DROT within six workdays after the leave authorization number was issued. This date appears in the first block of the Part I column. 7.1.6.5.  Follow-up procedures Part III. Follow-up to member's supervisor for any Part III that  is  not  received  (by  unit)  within three  workdays  after  the  member's  projected  return date.  Enter  this  date  (return  date  plus)  in  the  Part  I  column.  For  all  leaves  requiring "cancellation," or "correction," follow-up to the FSO if leave transaction, as appropriate,  AFMAN65-116V2  18 JULY 2017 37 has not cleared the DROT within six workdays after transmittal (date Part III received) of Part III to the FSO. 7.1.6.6.  Leave  Block  Closure.  After  Parts  I  and  III  for  a  given  block  have  cleared  the DROT  as  applicable,  attach  retained  Parts  III  to  the  AF  Forms  1486  and  submit  the completed block assignment package to the command section for closure or review of the leave  block  assignment.  The  unit  commander  or  designated  representative  must  verify Block  assignments  against  the  DROT  at  least  once  every  45  days,  whether  the  block assignment has been completed or not. If this is not done, it is likely some of the DROTs needed  for  verification  will  be  unavailable  as  Air  Force  Records  Disposition  Schedule requires  that  DROTs  maintained  at  the  unit  input  source  are  to  be  destroyed  after  two months.  After  the  unit  commander  or  representative  inspects  the  package,  if  the  block assignment package is not ready for closure, return to the unit leave monitor. If the unit commander or representative has certified closure of the leave block on AF Form 1134, Unit Leave Authorization Numbers-Block Assignments, destroy all Parts III and retain the AF Form 1486 according to Air Force Records Disposition Schedule. 7.1.7.  AF  Form  1134,  Procedures:  The  unit  commander  or  designated  representative  (may not be the unit leave monitor) maintains this form for all non LeaveWeb leave requests. It is used  to  assign  blocks  of  leave  authorization  numbers  to  unit  leave  monitor  and  to  certify closure of the blocks  (block assignment package) after all leave numbers in  the block have been processed by the FSO. The block assignment package consists of completed AF Forms 1486, and Parts III, AF Forms 988 retained for examination. 7.1.7.1.  To assign a block, enter: Date issued, block assigned (for example, DE 00100 to 00199), authorized in block (for example, 100) and name and rank of unit leave monitor assigned. Obtain monitor's signature. 7.1.7.2.  Additional blocks are assigned when needed, whether or not any or all preceding blocks have been closed. Infrequent issuance of block numbers may indicate the need to issue  smaller  blocks,  thereby  allowing  more  frequent  examination  of  unit  leave  records for  improved  leave  control  and  administration.  It  is  within  the  unit  commander's discretion  to  establish  the  block  size  of  leave  authorizations  issuable  for  any  unit.  It  is recommended, however, that block assignments be of manageable size and for not more than a month of use. 7.1.7.3.  Block Closure. To close a block, enter the date closed, and sign the commander's (or  designate)  signature  block.  Before  closing  the  block,  follow  paragraphs  1  and  2 procedures  in  examining  AF  Forms  988  and  1486,  and  the  DROT  of  the  block assignment package. 7.1.8.  AF Form 1486: 7.1.8.1.  Part  I  Column.  For  each  leave  number  assigned,  verify  that  dates  appear  in appropriate  blocks  of  the  Part  I  column.  An  "issue  date+6"  and  "return  date+3"  should appear  for  all  leave  number  assignments  in  blocks  1  and  3  (lines  1  and  3)  respectively. An SB01 or SB03 should appear in the second block. 7.1.8.2.  Part  III  Column.  For  all  leave  entries,  a  date  must  appear  in  the  first  block  for each leave number  assignment. For  each leave number where  "cancel" is entered in  the second block, verify that an SB06 date appears in the third block. For each leave number  38 AFMAN65-116V2  18 JULY 2017 where  "correct"  is  entered  in  the  second  block,  verify  that  an  SB05  date  appears  in  the third block. 7.1.8.3.  DROT Transaction Processing. Select a sample of the leave entries from the AF Form 1486 and referring to copies of the DROT, verify all dates of SB01, SB03, SB05, and  SB06  processing,  as  appropriate.  Also,  check  that  other  leave  information  (leave dates, type of leave if recorded on the AF Form 1486, and number of days leave charged) match the entries in the unit leave control log. 7.1.8.4.  AF  Form  988-Part  III.  For  Parts  III  retained  as  part  of  the  completed  block package, randomly  verify  member  and supervisor signatures in  Section  III, and that  the "no change" block only is checked in Section  III. Select a sample of these Parts III and referring to the proper leave entries on AF Form 1486, verify that leave chargeable dates are  identical.  The  completed  block  package  should  not  include  any  Parts  III  indicating "should be corrected" or "should be canceled." 7.1.8.5.  Corrective  Action.  Whenever  a  potential  discrepancy  is  identified,  discuss  the matter  with  your  responsible  leave  monitor,  and  make  sure  corrective  action,  if appropriate, is taken. For example, additional transaction processing may be necessary, or further completion of columns I and III, AF Form 1486. 7.2.  Failure to Return from Leave. 7.2.1.  Leave  Return  File  Check.  The  supervisor  is  required  to  check  suspense  copies  daily and, upon receipt of inquiries from the FSO or unit, to determine if member failed to return from leave. If the member has no extension, the supervisor notifies the unit commander that the member has failed to return on the projected date of return. 7.2.2.  Duty Status Change. For those members  who fail to return from leave as scheduled, the unit commander must comply with AFI 36-2911, Desertion and Unauthorized Absence. Use  AF  Form  2098,  Duty  Status  Change,  and  place  the  member  in  new  status.  When member's  status  changes  from  leave  to  Absent  Without  Leave  (AWOL),  hospital,  etc.,  the supervisor completes the leave request, Part III, with the day before the new status date as the return date and sends to unit. Unit forwards AF Form 2098 to personnel and AF Form 988 to FSO for processing. 7.3.  Extension of Leave. 7.3.1.  Member.  Makes  request  to  the  unit  commander  or  supervisor.  If  request  is  made  by telephone or electronic means, obtain the member's signature on return from leave. 7.3.2.  Unit.  The  unit  commander  or  supervisor  approves  or  disapproves  the  request  and notifies  the  member  accordingly.  If  unit  approves,  the  unit  notifies  the  supervisor;  if supervisor  approves,  the  unit  is  notified.  In  either  case,  the  extension  is  processed  as  a correction from Part III upon member's return from leave. 7.4.  Corrections.  Unit  or  supervisor  notifies  the  FSO  in  writing  of  any  required  corrections after processing of leave period. Corrections made to the leave dates in the certification require the  supervisor's  initials.  Any  correction  on  the  leave  document  must  be  legible.  Illegible documents are returned to the leave approving official for re-accomplishment. 7.5.  Cancellation.  The  supervisor  informs  unit  that  leave  is  canceled.  Supervisor  checks "should  be  canceled"  block  on  Part  III  of  AF  From  988,  types  or  prints  name  and  grade  in  AFMAN65-116V2  18 JULY 2017 39 appropriate block, signs in Signature block, and forwards to the unit. The unit annotates leave log "canceled"  when  supervisor  informs  that  such  is  the  case.  When  SBO6  transaction  appears  on DROT, unit posts DROT date to unit control log. If an SBO6 transaction appears on the DROT but  supervisor  has  not  previously  informed  unit  of  cancellation,  unit  must  verify  cancellation with supervisor. The FSO randomly checks leave cancellations with unit logs to make sure logs are properly annotated. If leave is canceled before Part I is sent to FSO, supervisor submits Part III to unit with the statement "Leave request canceled before submission of Part I to FSO." 7.6.  Processing Other than Ordinary Leave. 7.6.1.  Excess Leave: 7.6.1.1.  Member with ETS. Leave is automatically charged: 7.6.1.1.1.  Against accrued leave, then, 7.6.1.1.2.  Against advance leave if earned before ETS 7.6.1.1.3.  All remaining days as excess leave. 7.6.1.2.  Member without ETS. Leave granted as excess is designated by the commander and  is  stated  on  AF  Form  988.  Advance  leave  is  granted  only  in  amounts,  which  can reasonably be expected to be accrued by member. Leave taken over and above that which can be accrued is categorized as excess leave. 7.6.1.2.1.  Process  extended  excess  leaves  as  shown  in  AFI  36-3003,  as  Ordinary (type A) leaves. If the leave is to be for an indefinite period, the leave should be set up for 300 days. 7.6.2.  Non-Routine Processing. Leave types requiring non-routine processing are: 7.6.2.1.  Sick or Convalescent  Leave. May be granted upon the written recommendation of  or  by  proper  medical  authority.  (Table  7.3)  The  approval  authority  for  convalescent leave is the unit commander (or acting unit commander) and may not be delegated. 7.6.2.2.  Emergency Leave. May be requested by a member, a relative, or persons acting on  behalf  of  the  family.  Procedures  for  members  taking  funded  emergency  leave  using AF  Form 972,  Request  and Authorization for  Emergency Leave Travel,  are in  AFMAN 65-114,  Travel-Policy  and  Procedures  for  Financial  Services  Offices  and  Finance Offices-Reserve Component. 7.6.2.3.  Leave  During  Travel.  When  a  member  who  is  on  TDY  departs  on  leave  and returns  to  the  TDY  point,  the  unit  at  the  TDY  point  initiates  and  sends  input  to  the reporting agency at the TDY point. If the member on TDY departs on leave and does not return to the TDY point, the FSO at member's permanent duty station (PDS) extracts the leave  charge  from  the  travel  voucher  covering  all  travel  from  old  permanent  station  to new permanent station, including any leave periods and TDY travel performed from any TDY points. When member performs TDY and is not  assigned to  a TDY unit, member submits  leave  request  to  the  unit  of  assignment  (request  may  be  by  telephone  or electronic means). In such cases, the unit of assignment prepares AF Form 988. Annotate in  Member's  Signature  block  of  the  AF  Form  988  "Member  TDY  per  SO."  Member attaches Part II of any AF Forms 988 issued during TDY to the travel voucher (partial or  40 AFMAN65-116V2  18 JULY 2017 settlement). FSO returns Part II to member after computation and payment of the travel voucher. 7.6.2.4.  Appellate  Review  Leave.  A  member  who  has  been  adjudged  a  punitive discharge  whose  sentence  did  not  include  confinement,  or  who  has  served  the confinement,  or  has  had  the  confinement  deferred  and  is  awaiting  completion  of  the appellate review process, may be directed to be placed on appellate review leave.  (When excess leave has been directed for a member in an overseas area who has been convicted by  court  martial,  refer  to  AFI  36-3003).  The  unit  prepares  AF  Form  988  for  appellate review leave showing a  period of leave of 300 days. The leave authorization number is obtained from  the FSO  and these leaves  are recorded on the AF  Form 1486 maintained by  the  FSO.  Upon  signature  of  the  Unit  commander,  Part  I  is  sent  to  the  FSO  for processing,  Part  II  is  given  to  the  member  and  Part  III  held  by  the  leave  approval authority  until  completion  of  the  appellate  review  leave.  Upon  completion  of  the  leave, Part III is sent to the FSO to return the member to duty. If the appellate review leave has been approved by the overseas commander, the overseas FSO must process the appellate review leave.  If, at  the end of the original appellate review leave period,  the member is still on appellate review leave and is no longer assigned to the overseas FSO, the overseas FSO  must  contact  the  stateside  FSO  to  which  the  member  has  been  assigned.  The stateside FSO provides the appellate review leave number for the next period of appellate review leave and the overseas FSO processes that leave. From that point on, the appellate review leave for the member is processed by the servicing stateside FSO. 7.6.2.5.  Leave  Awaiting  Space  Available  (Space-A)  Transportation.  When  members register  for  Space-A  transportation  at  an  AMC  terminal,  Part  II  of  AF  Form  988  is stamped with the date and time of registration. In certifying leave taken, supervisors must check part  II (member's copy) to make sure all periods awaiting Space-A transportation (regardless of whether member obtains transportation or not) are accurately reflected on part III of AF Form 988. The member must certify on section III, Part III, whether or not space-available transportation was used, and date of sign-up, if applicable. 7.6.2.6.  Special  Leave.  A  non-chargeable  increment  of  Special  Rest  and  Recuperation leave  (and  transportation,  if  applicable),  is  authorized  to  enlisted  members  in  certain specialties who voluntarily extend their overseas tours. 7.6.2.7.  Educational  Leave  of  Absence.  A  non-chargeable  leave  type  which  is  for  an authorized  leave  of  absence  for  a  period  not  to  exceed  two  years  for  the  purpose  of permitting  the  member  to  pursue  a  program  of  education.  (See  AFI  36-3003,  for eligibility criteria and administrative instructions.) 7.6.2.8.  Recruiter Assistance Program (RAP). HQ Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS) oversees  RAP.  See  the  local  recruiting  squadron  and  the  Recruiter  Assistance  Program Operations  Handbook  for  detailed  instructions  and  guidance.  If  you  need  additional guidance, contact AFRS/RSOAP, at DSN 665-0381 or commercial (210) 565-0381. (See AFI 36-3003, for eligibility criteria and administrative instructions.) 7.7.  Special Leave Accrual.  Members normally lose leave accumulated in excess of 60 days at end of the fiscal year (30 Sept). Refer to AFI 36-3003 for Special leave Accrual.  AFMAN65-116V2  18 JULY 2017 41 7.8.  Terminal Leave.  Commander may approve terminal leave for member who makes request. Compute member's leave balance through last day of active duty by using the last LES or, if LES is  unavailable,  request  the  FSO  to  provide  leave  balance.  Leave  is  taken  in  full  days;  half-day balances  must  be  rounded  down  to  a  full  day,  and  remainder  is  included  in  member's  final separation pay, unless the member has already sold 60 days leave, in which case any remaining leave days are lost. Also, deduct the number of days' leave taken that are not shown on the LES or  inquiry.    Work  with  servicing  FSO  to  ensure  accurate  leave  balance  to  be  used  for  terminal leave. 7.9.  Leave Within 30 Days of Separation or Retirement with Return to PDS  Before ETS, or Delay En Route Incident to PCS for Separation.  Leave approving authority must: 7.9.1.  Advise member departing on leave, or departing PCS with delay en route, to schedule the return from such leave no later than the 15th day before DOS. 7.9.2.  Advise member to use the exact number of days' leave granted. 7.9.3.  Advise  member  that  failure  to  comply  with  7.9.1.  and  7.9.2.  above  may  result  in  an adjustment and possible delay of final settlement of pay and allowances. 7.9.4.  Enter statement at top of AF Form 988, "Member separating (date)." 7.10.  Permissive TDY (PTDY).  Normally use AF Form 988 for all types of PTDY. Exceptions are listed in AFI 36-3003. 7.10.1.  Immediately  after  obtaining  leave  authorization  numbers  unit  commander  (or designee) approves PTDY (and leave, if applicable) and immediately forwards part  I to  the FSO.  Part  II  is  given  to  the  member.  Part  III  is  retained  by  the  approving  official  for completion  upon  the  member's  return.  Forms  that  contain  overlapping  dates  or  are improperly completed are returned to the approving official for correction. 7.10.2.  If leave is to be taken in conjunction with PTDY, a separate AF Form 988 must be prepared for approval by the leave approving official. If leave is taken immediately prior to PTDY, enter the date and time the member is authorized to depart on leave in block 10 of the AF Form 988 used for leave. The last day of chargeable leave (block 12) is the day prior to the day that PTDY begins (including travel time). If leave is taken immediately after PTDY, enter the date leave begins and 0001 hours in block 10. Once the member has ended the first period of leave or PTDY, Part III for the first AF Form 988 may be completed and sent to the unit. If it is impractical or impossible to obtain the member’s signature at that time, annotate the circumstances  and forward to  the unit.  If it is doubtful that member completed the first leave or PTDY as projected, the Part III for that AF Form 988 may be held by the supervisor and completed upon member's return. 7.10.3.  Extensions of PTDY. See AFI 36-3003 for approval authority for extensions. 7.10.4.  Terminal PTDY. PTDY is defined as PTDY granted in conjunction with separation or retirement where member will be in a PTDY status on the last day of active duty or when the member takes PTDY in conjunction with terminal leave. Terminal PTDY will be handled in the same manner as terminal leave. That is, the leave authorization number for Terminal PTDY  will  be  issued  by  the  FSO  and  may  be  recorded  on  the  same  leave  control  log  as terminal  leaves.  NOTE:  All  other  PTDYs  (those  which  are  not  terminal)  will  have  leave authorization numbers issued by the unit.  42 AFMAN65-116V2  18 JULY 2017 7.11.  LeaveWeb. 7.11.1.  Finance  trains  the  unit  leave  monitor  (ULM)  and  alternates  on  their  roles  and responsibilities in managing the leave program and on the use of leave web prior to issuing the unit administration access. This includes briefing the ULM to inform the FSO when they leave the unit or are no longer assigned as the ULM or alternate. AF Form 1134 is used for leave requests other than LeaveWeb. ULM will use a memorandum to certify that all leaves were closed, validated and reconciled for the period indicated as well as the exceptions. This will be accomplished every 30 days covering the previous 45 days of leave input. 7.11.2.  LeaveWeb  procedures  for  members,  approving  officials  and  unit  commander’s support staff. 7.11.2.1.  Member  LeaveWeb  Procedures  for  Ordinary  Leave:  for  most  leave  requests members  request  leave  in  LeaveWeb  much  the  same  way  as  requesting  leave  using manual procedures. 7.11.2.2.  Other than Ordinary Leave Procedures: For other than ordinary leaves or if the member is unable to access the LeaveWeb system, the member prepares and coordinates an AF Form 988 according to the procedures listed in this chapter. The member forwards the documentation to the unit commander’s support staff for processing in LeaveWeb by the ULM after approval by the appropriate commander. Input leave requests no later than one day prior to the start date of leave if possible. Upon return, the member coordinates with the supervisor and unit commander’s support staff to certify the return from leave. 7.11.2.3.  Bases  using  LeaveWeb:  The  ULM  should  access  LeaveWeb  daily  to  validate leave  request  submitted  by  the  members  and  approved  by  an  authorized  official.  The leave  request  should  be  reviewed  to  ensure  that  the  leave  request  contains  appropriate emergency  contact  information.  Review  comments  provided  in  the  appropriate  block  if leaves are rejected to the member and approving official. 7.11.3.  Other key duties: 7.11.3.1.  Unit  admin  has  capability  to  input  other  than  ordinary  type  leaves  (i.e. convalescent,  permissive).  Members  will  bring  the  forms  to  unit  admin  for  this  type  of leave. Enter them into system under new manual request. (They will flow through system as normal leave from that point on.) 7.11.3.2.  Leave balance listing.  At the end of each month print the leave balance listing for your unit(s). Review this list for any personnel either missing from this list or on the list but they are not assigned to your unit(s). Identify any required changes electronically or in writing to finance as soon as possible for the changes to be made. 7.11.3.3.  Member  maintenance.  Member  information  required  to  update  LeaveWeb. Correct e-mail address. Duty phone. Duty section. 7.11.3.4.  Unit leave log. 7.11.3.4.1.  Print AF Form  1486 every 30 days, from  LeaveWeb, that consists of 45 days of leave input. Unit commanders are required to verify and sign that leaves are closed  and  corrections,  cancellations  (if  applicable)  are  annotated  on  the  AF  Form 1486.  ULM  should  review  the  AF  Form  1486  weekly  in  LW  to  ensure  that  all transactions  have  been  reconciled.  Documented  follow  up  conducted  with  the  FSO  AFMAN65-116V2  18 JULY 2017 43 determines the status of unreconciled or unprocessed leaves no later than 6 workdays after the transactions were validated by the ULM. 7.11.3.4.2.  Make  certain  that  all  leaves  have  processed  and  closed;  follow-up  with finance  for  any  outstanding  transactions.  Follow-up  on  open  leaves  in  R0  and  R1 status must be accomplished with the member and/or supervisor by the unit admin. 7.11.4.  Status  of  Leave:  Q0  -  leave  has  been  entered  by  member  but  not  submitted.  Q1  - leave submitted by member but not yet approved by approving official. Q2 - leave approved awaiting validation from unit admin. Q9 - leave canceled before validation. R0 - member on leave;  awaiting  submission  of  part  3.  R1  -  member  completes  part  3  and  is  awaiting supervisor’s  approval.  R2  -  return  from  leave  has-been  approved  awaiting  validation  from unit admin. R4 - leave closed. R9 - leave canceled after it was validated. 7.11.5.  Troubleshooting: 7.11.5.1.  A member is not getting e-mail with their new password. Check e-mail address under  member  maintenance.  Does  it  match  global  address  in  outlook?  If  not  change  it. Manually change address if member does not have e-mail. 7.11.5.2.  System  will  not  let  member  take  leave.    Ask  if  the  member  just  put  in  for  an extension. Contact finance and request member's DOS to be adjusted in system to allow member to take leave. Ask if the member is within 30 days of separation or retirement. If so,  contact  the  separations  clerk  at  finance  for  guidance.  If  the  member  is  requesting separations, permissive TDY or terminal leave, have the member complete AF Form 988 and provide to FSO. 7.11.5.3.  Unit admin cannot login.  Check web address. Are you trying to enter through the member’s page? Are you using the right login? Admin use last name. When you take leave you enter through the member page with SSN#. 7.11.5.4.  Server crashes.  Have members complete manual leave forms. Contact finance for get well info. Hold manual leave forms until system comes online and manually input leaves. Finance  will advise to  bring leaves in  for  processing if system will be down for extensive period of time. 7.11.6.  Additional notes: 7.11.6.1.  Procedures  for  resolving  trouble  issues;  all  issues  must  be  addressed  to  your supporting unit administrator or FSO. Issues that cannot be resolved by Finance will  be routed Helpdesk (saf.fmpaffso.customerservice@us.af.mil)  or  by  calling  them  at  DSN  787-3117  or Comm 937-257-3117.
