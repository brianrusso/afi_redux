Purpose. This volume was developed to  provide deployed Airmen w ith alternative methods ofaccomplishing certain engineering tasks when there is insufficient time or materials or it is impractical toemploy conventional methods. Information regarding installation of standard expedient construction sys-tems such as Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR), is beyond the scope of this publication, butis available in other pamphlets in this series. 1.2.  Overview. This pamphlet contains illustrations of basic material applications and construction meth-ods that have proven their worth during field applications. Any data and definitions presented are generalin nature and should be used solely as guides. Detailed drawings are provided throughout this publicationto help supervisors illustrate and explain requiremen ts to their craftsmen. The data presented hereinapplies primarily to a field construction force operation in a remote or bare base area ( Figure 1.1.) ham-pered by shortages of standard constr uction materials. However, it will be evident that some proceduresmay be relevant and helpfu l during peacetime disaster response. In addition,  many of the techniquesdescribed may apply during post-att ack recovery efforts. For the pu rpose of this doc ument, the word"expedient" is defined as: "a m eans devised or employe d in a time and place  where prompt action isessential." Expedient engineering  definitely does not preclude usi ng normal engineer practices wheretime and materials are available. Figure 1.1.  Typical Desert Bare Base Beddown. 1.3.  Environmental Considerations. The United States Air Force is committed to achieving and main-taining environmental quality to protect US intere sts. Upholding a high level of environmental qualityduring training exercises or actual  contingencies is a dif ficult challenge that must be achieved. T o thisAFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200811end, all Air Force personnel involved in these operations are charged with environmental stewardship. Inno way is the intent of this res ponsibility either removed or diminis hed simply because expedient mea-sures are to be employed. Further information on how to integrate environmentally responsible practicesduring contingency operations can be found in Ai r Force Handbook 10-222, Volume 4, EnvironmentalGuide for Contingency Operations. 1.4.  Task Identification. As a general rule, this volume attemp ts to address only  expedient field con-struction and repair tasks  that are accomplished during wartime or contingencies. However, some con-struction and repair tasks  addressed in this pamphlet  may also be employed  during disaster recoveryoperations when immediate action is necessary and resources are limited. 1.5.  General Safety Practices. One of the first rules fo r response to a ny situation requiring expedientapplications is to be flexible a nd remain safe. Supervisors must alwa ys keep safety in mind when usingnonstandard construction methods and  materials. Losing or injuring  personnel or disabling equipmentduring field operations can severely impact miss ion accomplishment. Never compromise personnel andequipment safety when implementing the expedient procedures described in this pamphlet. 1.5.1.  Whether working alongside other military  units; federal, state, an d local disaster recoveryforces; government civilian employ ees and contractors; or traine d and untrained volunteers, it isessential that everyone involved is aware of the procedures used to identify hazards. 1.5.2.  To ensure safety, crew leaders should know the capabilities and limitations of assigned person-nel and monitor all work ef forts. In addition, make certain that  activities are coordinated with allinvolved. For example, debris removal in and around facilities is a dangerous, critical task. Vibrationsfrom heavy equipment can cause a building to collapse on recovery workers. 1.5.3.  When working in a contaminated environment, be sure to wear the appropriate individual pro-tective equipment (IPE) for the hazard present. Wash contaminated clothing and take a shower as soonas possible after working in a contaminated environment. Even when working in an environment thatis not contaminated, wear protective equipment for dust, noise, sharp objects, and construction mate-rials. Plywood and lumber, brick and block, and sheet metal can all  cause cuts and injuries. Even asmall cut can develop into a serious injury if the wound becomes infected. 12AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Chapter 2  ROAD AND DRAINAGE SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR 2.1.  Introduction. Expedient construction and repair of road s and drainage system s during disasters orafter an attack could be crucial to recovery operations and mission sustainment. These efforts may includetree clearing, grubbing and strippi ng; grading and assessing the drai nage system; repairing existing orconstructing new roads and drainage  systems; and implementing draina ge system erosion control prac-tices and maintenance. In remote locations, or during post-attack operations, engineer personnel may havefew supplies and resources to accomplish needed cons truction and repair. In this type of environment,engineers will need to use ingenuity , available resources, and a lot of backbreaki ng labor to accomplishthe mission. 2.2.  Overview. The concepts and examples in this chapter  may be applied singularly or in combinationor may be modified to suit field conditions for expedient construction. By using these procedures, an engi-neer contingent faced with resource shortfalls may be able to meet the minimum requirements for missionaccomplishment until additional resources become available. The topics presented in this chapter consistof expedient road construction and repair , expedient drainage construction and  repair, and drainage sys-tem erosion control and maintenance. Note: Information regarding airfield pavement repair procedures iscontained in Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-270-07, O&M: Airfield Damage Repair. 2.3.  Expedient Road Construction and Repair. Establishment of useable  roadways during disa sterrecovery operations or after an attack is crucial. Tasks may be as simple as clearing existing pavements oras arduous as actually constructing new surfaces. At austere sites where equipment and materials are lim-ited, expedient construction and repair measures may be needed to provide workable surfaces in a timelyfashion. The expedient road construc tion methods discussed in this chap ter are: wire mesh; sand grid;plank tread; landing mat; and snow and ice. In addition, soil cement, geo-fiber, lime, and fly ash stabiliza-tion procedures are also discu ssed. Field Manual (FM) 5-34, Engineer Field Data and FM 5-430-00-1,Planning and Design of Roads, Airfields, and Heliports in the Theater of Operations—Road Design, pro-vide further options for dealing with problems related to expedient road construction. 2.3.1.  Expedient Road Construction Methods.  2.3.1.1.  Wire Mesh. Chicken wire or chain-link (cyclone) fencing material may be used for expe-dient surfaces over sand. Adding a layer of burla p or similar material und erneath the wire meshhelps confine the sand. Longer life can be obtained by proper subgrade preparation, multilayer orsandwich construction, and staking the edges of the wire mesh at 3-foot intervals. As indicated inFigure 2.1., diagonal wires that cross the centerline at 45-degree angles and are securely attachedto buried pickets fortify the lighter meshes. The more layers used the more durable the surface willbecome. Other roads should never cross wire-mesh roads unless planking or some such material isplaced over the mesh to protect it. In addition, mesh surfaces should not be used on muddy roadsbecause they prevent grading and reshaping of the surface when  ruts appear. Commercial wire/fabric barriers, laid flat, prov ide similar confinement and separation as the wire mesh/burlap andmay be more available in the area of responsibility (AOR). AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200813Figure 2.1.  Wire-Mesh Road Construction Details. 2.3.1.2.  Sand-Grid Roads. This technique involves the conf inement of sand or sandy materialsin interconnected cellular elements called grid s (Geocells) to produce a  load-distributing pave-ment base layer. It has application in areas  where sandy materials are  abundant and quality con-struction aggregates are not av ailable. A sand-grid road over  a sand subgrade is capable ofsupporting over 10,000 passes of heavy truck traffic, including tandem axle loads of up to 53,000pounds. The plastic honeycomb grid is manufactured and shipped in unexpanded sections that areeasily expanded for field use (see Figure 2.2.). Each 4-inch-thick section expands to form a hon-eycomb arrangement of 561 cells that cover  an area 8 by 20 feet and weigh 1 10 pounds. Otherapplications of sand-grid technology include field fortifications, slope protection, channel protec-tion, and retaining walls. 2.3.1.2.1.  When installing this material, use pickets or place sand on the corners and sides tomaintain placement. After positioning the entire first layer, use a bucket loader to begin fillingthe grid, working from one edge of the repair to ward the center. A full grid section will holdthe weight of a bucket loader. A four-person crew can quickly construct a sand-grid road usingbucket loaders, light bulldozer s and vibratory compaction roll ers. The use of rough-terrainforklifts; water distributors; asphalt distribut ors; long-handled, round-point shovels; and8-foot by 4-foot by 3/8-inch  sheets of plyw ood can increase the effectiveness and speed ofconstruction. 14AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 2.2.  Typical Sand-Grid Material in Shipping Configuration. 2.3.1.2.2.  As the grids are filled,  the loader can drive forward onto the grids to expand theirrange. Use shovels and rakes to spread the material to overfill the cells by a uniform layer of 1to 2 inches. Provide suf ficient compaction by  using a rubber-tire or steel-wheel roller. How-ever, be aware that over compaction can damage the sand grid and result in premature failure.After compacting the first layer, repeat the process, starting by placing a porous layer of mem-brane (typically permeable geotextiles or geof abrics that are lightwe ight, waterproof, andbreathable). Put the top layer of sand grid with  its long dimension stretched 90 degrees to thefirst. This makes it perpendicular  to the r oad centerline and increases strength. Once again,overfill the grid cells by 1 to 2 inches. The  surface can be further  stabilized by applying asand-asphalt surface of about one-gallon of  RC-250 asphalt cutback per square yard.  Figure2.3. is an example of using sand grids to construct roads over rough terrain. Figure 2.3.  Sand-Grid Road Construction. 2.3.1.2.3.  When making road repairs  with this material, place the  initial 4-inch layer of sandgrid in the crater parallel to the centerline of the roadway. Expand the sand grid, using shovelsto fill the grid-edge sections to hold it in place. Cover the entire bottom of the cavity with gridmaterial in this manner so it conforms to the shape of the repair, curving or cutting as neces-AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200815sary (see Figure 2.4.). Sections that do not  fully expand add strength to the base. After posi-tioning the first layer, fill the grid, working fr om one edge of the repair toward the center .Compact the cells level with the  pavement, using a rubbe r-tire or steel-wheel roller or vibra-tory-plate tampers, and remove any excess material after compaction. If more than one layer isneeded, follow the previous instructions for sand-grid road construction. Figure 2.4.  Sand-Grid Construction Details. 2.3.1.3.  Plank-Tread Roads. Use plank-tread roads for crossing  short sections of loos e sand orwet, soft ground. This type of road may last severa l months if it is well-built and has an adequatebase (see Figure 2.5.). 2.3.1.3.1.  To construct a plank-tread road, first place sleepers 12 to 16 feet long perpendicularto the centerline on 3- to 4-foot centers, depending on the loads to be carried and subgrade con-ditions. If finished ti mber is not available, logs may be used as sl eepers. Next, place 4- by10-inch planks parallel to the line of traffic to form two treads about 36 inches apart. Staggerthe joints to prevent forming weak spots. If desired, 6-inch curbs may be installed on the insideof the treads. When built with an adequate ba se, plank roads can last for several months.Planks 3 to 4 inches thick, 8 to 12 inches wide, and at least 13 feet long are ideal for flooring,stringers, and sleepers. When  desired, 3- by 10-inch planks  (rough, not finished) can replacethe 4- by 10-inch timbers shown in  Figure 2.5. Rough 3- by 8-inch a nd 3- by 10-inch plankscan normally be cut to order. 2.3.1.3.2.  Position stringers in  regular rows parallel to the centerline on  3-foot centers withstaggered joints. Lay floor planks  across the stringers with about 1-inch gaps when seasonedlumber is used. The gaps allo w for swelling when the lumber  absorbs moisture. Spike theplanks to every stringer. Place 6-inch-deep gu ardrails on each side with a 12-inch gap leftbetween successive lengths of guardrails for surface-water drainage. Install pickets along eachside at 15-foot intervals to hold the roadway in line. 16AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 2.5.  Plank-Tread Road Layout Plan. 2.3.1.3.3.  To achieve proper drainage, construct the base for a plank  road with a transverseslope, as shown in  Figure 2.6., instead of a center crown. T o provide a smoother riding sur-face, put treads parallel to the line of traffic over floor planks. Figure 2.6.  Plank Road Construction Details. 2.3.1.4.  Airfield Landing Mats. The demand for rapidly constructed airfields led to the develop-ment of several portable, metal  landing mats. As metal airfield  landing mats became a standardsupply item, they were quickly put  to use on beaches as well as airf ields. They are still in use asexpedients for crossing sandy terr ain. Landing mat designs fabricated  from aluminum alloys cansupport heavier loads than many other materials and have a lower weight per square foot as com-pared to timbers. They also provide smoother surfaces so that the smallest-wheeled vehicle usingAFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200817the road can obtain traction. The three most common types of matting employed in expedient roadconstruction are pierced steel planking (PSP), M8A1, and AM-2 (see Figure 2.7.). Figure 2.7.  Common Landing Mat Variations. 2.3.1.4.1.  When used on sand, place the metal landing mats directly on the sand to the lengthand width desired. Install the mat so that its long axis is perpendicular to the flow of traffic. Ifa width greater than the ef fective length of one  plank is required, use half  sections to staggerthe joints. A second layer of the steel mat, laid as a treadway over the initial layer, increases itseffectiveness. If PSP is used, place an impervious membrane under the mat to smooth and firmthe subgrade, thus improving the road stability. 2.3.1.4.2.  After extended  use, landing mats te nd to curl at the edge s. This problem can beovercome by anchoring the edges  properly. Screw-type earth anchors provide the best meansof anchoring. Another method of securing the edges is to us e a curb of timber on the outsideedge of the road and either wire  it tightly to buried logs laid para llel to the road or stake it a sshown in Figure 2.8. In addition, the road surface must be void of high spots and ruts for mat-ting to be effective. Such irregularities cause difficulties in assembling the matting pieces. 2.3.1.5.  Snow and Ice Roads. In regions with heavy snowfall and where temperatures are belowfreezing for extended periods, expedient roads can  be constructed over the snow. When a road islaid out over snow or ice, make grades and curves as gentle as possible and compact the snow untilit is capable of supporting the weight of the vehicles expected to use it. Once proper compaction isachieved, add water to the comp acted plane and allow it to fr eeze to produce a sounder wearingsurface. Vehicle tire traction can be improved by spreading sand over the surface. 18AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 2.8.  Landing Mat Anchoring Technique. 2.3.2.  Soil Stabilization Techniques. In addition to expedient r oad construction proceduresaddressed previously, mechanical and chemical soil stabilization tech niques can be used to bolsterroad surfaces during contingencies (Figure 2.9.). Many of these approaches  can be ef fective forextended periods. Mechanically stabilized soil mixtures are widely used as surfaces for military roadsto carry light traffic where difficult soil conditions exist. Chemical admixtures are often used to stabi-lize soils when mechanical methods are inadequate and replacing an undesirable soil with a desirablesoil is not an option. Most chemical admixture stabilization projects involve the use of cement, lime,or fly ash. While both of these methods appear to be labor intensive, they are quite the opposite whencompared to standard road construction methods. In terms of mate rial, both processes are less costlythan normal road construction involving asphalt or concrete. Warning. The use of cement, lime or flyash to stabilize a soil with a high content of sulfates (as present in many Southwest Asia (SWA) coun-tries) can lead to heave from ettri ngite formation. Engineers may need  to have soil tested for sulfatecontent before selecting a stabilization agent. Figure 2.9.  Stabilizing a Tent Area in French Guinea. 2.3.2.1.  Chemical Mixtures Methods. Although effective, there are hazards associated withchemical stabilizers. When working with these materials, refer to detailed information listed in theMaterial Safety Data Sheet (M SDS) prepared by the manufactur er. Generally, the hazard of air-borne particles is reduced signifi cantly in the open air on the c onstruction site. General informa-tion is also provided in FM 5-410, Military Soils Engineering, Appendix C. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008192.3.2.1.1.  Soil-Cement. Soil-cement, also referred to  as cement-modified s oil andcement-treated aggregate base, is a dense, highly compacted mixture of soil or roadway mate-rial, Portland cement, and water. Almost any inorganic type of soil is suitable for soil-cement.However, granular soils are preferred over clay  soils because they pulverize more easily andrequire less cement to achieve the required strength and durability. A well-graded granular soilwill generally require 5 to 8 percent cement by dry weight of soil aggregate, while a soil that issandy silt with 25 percent passing the No. 200 sieve will need 8 to 11 percent cement. In addi-tion, granular soils are more desirable for this  application since they tend to make the surfaceresistant to both the abrasive effects of traffic and the penetration of precipitation. 2.3.2.1.1.1.  Soil-Cement's Advantages. Soil-cement's advantages include high strengthand durability combined with  low first cost, making it an  economical material. About 90percent of the material needed  for soil-cement is already i n place, keeping handling andhauling costs to a minimum. Like concrete, so il-cement continues to gain strength withage. Because soil-cement is compacted into  a tight matrix during construction, the pave-ment does not deform under traf fic or develop potholes like unbound aggregate bases.Soil-cement is capable of br idging over weak subgrade areas and is highly resistant todeterioration caused by seasonal moisture changes and freeze/thaw cycles. 2.3.2.1.1.2.  Installation Steps. Tests must be performed to determine the proper cementcontent, compaction, and water requirements for the soil material used. Soil-cement can bemixed in either a central plant or mixed in place. However, during contingency situationsinvolving expediency, mixing the material in place is  often the obvious choice. Forin-place operations, either clay or granular soils ca n be used. During a mixing-in-placeoperation, always follow the four basic soil-cement paving steps: spreading, mixing, com-pacting, and curing. 2.3.2.1.1.2.1.  When the roadway has been shaped  to grade and the soil loosened to adepth of 8 to 10 inches, the proper quantity of cement is spread on the in-place soil. 2.3.2.1.1.2.2.  The cement is then thoroughly mixed  into the soil and the requiredamount of water is added. 2.3.2.1.1.2.3.  The mixture is then tightly compacted with rollers, shaped to the propercontour and rolled again to achieve a smooth finish. Finally, to supply and maintain themoisture needed for hydration, the soil-cement is sprayed with water and sealed with abituminous mixture. Further information  regarding soil-cement procedures can befound in HQ AFCESA Enginee ring Technical Letter (ETL) 01-06,  Contingency Air-field Pavement Specifications. This document can be downloaded from the AFCESAweb site: https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/AFP40/Attachment/20070629/ETL%2001-6.pdf 2.3.2.1.2.  Lime. Experience has shown that lime reacts  with medium, moderately fine, andfine-grained soils to produce de creased plasticity, increased workability and strength, andreduced swell. Several soil classifications in the U nified Soils Classification System (USCS)are potentially capable of being stabilized wi th lime. Additional data on lime stabilizationactions can be found in FM 5-410. 20AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 20082.3.2.1.2.1.  If the soil temperatur e is less than 60 de grees Fahrenheit and is not expectedto increase for one month, ch emical reactions will not occu r rapidly. Thus, the strengthgain of the lime-soil mixture will be minima l. Lime-soil mixtures should be scheduled sothat sufficient durability is gained to resist any freeze/thaw cycles expected. If heavy vehi-cles are allowed on the lime-stabilized soil before a 10- to 14-day curing period, pavementdamage can be expected. Lime gains strength slowly and requires  about 14 days in hotweather and 28 days in cool  weather to gain significant  strength. Unsurfaced lime-stabi-lized soils degrade rapidly under traffic, so bituminous surface treatment is recommendedto prevent surface deterioration. 2.3.2.1.2.2.  Lime can be used either to modify some of the physical properties and therebyimprove the quality of a soil or to transform the soil into a stabilized mass, which increasesits strength and durability. The amount of lime additive depe nds on whether the soil is tobe modified or stabilized. Th e lime to be used  may be either hydr ated or quicklime,although most stabilization is done using hydrat ed lime. The reason is that quicklime ishighly caustic and dangerous to use. 2.3.2.1.2.3.  When lime is added to a soil, a comb ination of reactions begins to take placeimmediately. These reactions are nearly complete withi n one hour, although substantialstrength gain is not reflected fo r some time. The reactions result in a change in both thechemical composition and the physical properties. Most lime has a pH of about 12.4 whenplaced in a water solution. Therefore, the pH is a good indicator of the desirable lime con-tent of a soil-lime mixture. The reaction that takes place when lime is introduced to a soilgenerally causes a significant change in the plasticity of the soil. 2.3.2.1.3.  Fly Ash. Fly ash consists mainly of silic on and aluminum compounds that, whenmixed with lime and water , forms a hardened cementitious  mass capable of  obtaining highcompression strengths. Fly ash is a by-product of coal-fired, el ectric-power-generation facili-ties. The liming quality of fly ash is highly dependent on the type of coal used in power gener-ation. Fly ash is categorized into two broad classes by its  calcium oxide (CaO) content. Theyare: Class C and Class F. Refer to FM 5-410 for more information on fly ash stabilization. 2.3.2.1.3.1.  Class C. This class of fly ash has a high CaO content (12 percent or more) andoriginates from sub-bituminous and lignite (soft) coal. Fly ash from lignite has the highestCaO content, often exceeding 30 pe rcent. This type can be used as a stand-alone stabiliz-ing agent. The strength characteristics of Class C fly ash having a CaO less than 25 percentcan be improved by adding lime. 2.3.2.1.3.2.  Class F. This class of fly ash has a low CaO content (less than 10 percent) andoriginates from anthracite and  bituminous coal. Class F fly  ash has an insuf ficient CaOcontent for the po zzolanic reaction to occur. It is not effective as a stabilizing agent byitself; but when mixed with lime or lime and cement, the fly ash mixture becomes an effec-tive stabilizing agent. 2.3.2.1.3.3.  Lime Fly Ash (LFA) Mixtures. LFA mixtures can contai n either Class C orClass F fly ash. The LF A design process is a  four-part process that requires laboratoryanalysis to determine the op timum fines (particles passing  a Number 200 sieve) contentand lime-to-fly-ash ratio. The op timum fines content  is the percentage of fly ash thatresults in the maximum density of the soil mix. The initial fly ash content should be aboutAFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 20082110 percent based on the weight of the total mix. The design fines content should be 2 per-cent above the optimum fines content. For example, if 14 percent fly ash yields the maxi-mum density, the design fines content would be 16 percent. The moisture density relationwould be based on the  16 percent mixture. LFA is constructed in laye rs not less than 4compacted inches. Final thickness and actual proportions are set by  the engineer. AfterLFA has been constructed, the surface must be kept moist until a bituminous curing coveris applied. 2.3.2.1.3.4.  Lime-Cement-Fly Ash (LCF) Mixtures: The design methodology for deter-mining the LCF ratio for delibe rate construction is the same  as for LFA except cement isadded at the ratio of 1 to 2  percent of the design  fines content. Ceme nt may be used inplace of or in addition to lime; however , the design fines content should be maintained.When expedient construction is  required, use an initial mix  proportion of 1 percent Port-land cement, 4 percent lime, 16 percent fly ash, and 79 percent soil. Minimum unconfinedstrength requirements (see Table 2.1.) must be met. If test specimens do not meet strengthrequirements, add cement in  1/2 percent increments un til strength is adequate.  Note: Aswith cement-stabilized base course material s, LCF mixtures containing more than 4 per-cent cement cannot be used as base course material under Air Force airfield pavements. Table 2.1.

Mechanical Mixture (Sand Fiber) Method. The Army Engineer Research and Devel-opment Center (ERDC) in Vicksburg, Mississippi, developed this rapid-road-construction methodto overcome sandy and soft soil deficiencies. The road construction procedure involves stabilizingsand with geofibers, also known as sand fibers. The effectiveness of this approach has been veri-fied through extensive testing at the ERDC testing facilities. 2.3.2.2.1.  Sand-fiber ro ad stabilization technology involv es mixing small amounts (0.8 per-cent by weight) of hair-like, 5-centimeter-long (2 inches) polypropylene fibers into moist sandwith a rotary mixer ( Figure 2.10.). The sand-fiber layer is  then compacted with asmooth-drum vibratory roller. Next, a wearing surface is added by spraying a re sin-modifiedemulsion or emulsified asphalt onto the road surface to bond the sand grains with the fiber fil-aments and protect the sand-fiber surface. 2.3.2.2.2.  Using the geofiber cons truction method, military supply roads can be constructedquickly at remote sites, over beaches, or acros s desert sands with less equipment, manpower,22AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008and materials than ot her road-building methods require. Experiments conducted at ERDCindicate that roads constructed with this new technology can carry over 10,000 passes of heavymilitary supply traffic with very little or no maintenance required. Sand-fiber stabilization usesexisting military construction equipment and re quires no special construc tion skills. In addi-tion, it can be used on a wide variety of  sands and silty soils found around the world.  Table2.2. lists soil stabilization me thods for specific applicati ons.

Geotextiles Technique. Another technique available for improving the condition of soilsbesides mechanical blending and chemical stab ilization involves the us e of geotextiles (see  Fig-ure 2.11.). The term geotextile  refers to any permeable textil e used with foundation, soil, rock,earth, or any other geotechnical engineering-related material as an integral part of a human-made24AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008project, structure, or system. Geotextiles are also commonly referred to as geofabrics, engineeringfabrics, or just fabrics. Figure 2.11.  Using Geotextile During Road Construction. 2.3.2.3.1.  Geotextiles serve four  primary functions: reinforcement, separation, drainage, andfiltration. In many situations, using these fabrics can replace soil, which saves time, materials,and equipment costs. In theater -of-operations horizontal construction, the primary concern iswith separating and reinforcing low load-bearing soils to reduce construction time. 2.3.2.3.2.  The design engineer attempts to reduce the thickness of a pavement structure when-ever possible. Tests show that for low load-bearing soils (generally anything less than a 5 CBRvalue) the use of geofabrics can often decrease the amount of subbase and base course materi-als required. The fabric lends its tensile stre ngth to the soil to incre ase the overall designstrength. Figure 2.12. shows an example of this concept. 2.3.2.3.3.  Swamps, peat  bogs, and beach sa nds can also be  quickly stabilized by the use ofgeofabrics. The normal solution is to remove  the poor base material by a process commonlyreferred to as “mucking.” However, this is not an option during most contingencies for a num-ber of reasons. Specifically, the removal pro cess is often very dif ficult and time-consuming.Furthermore, it can only be used if the area has sound, stable soil underneath the soft soil anda suitable fill ma terial is available near by. Consequently, during contingencies, a bridge ofbase course construction material is usually placed directly over  the weak soil separated by alayer of geotextile material, as shown in Figure 2.13. The basic construction sequence for thedirect fill process is shown in Figure 2.14. Specific geotextile application details are providedin FM 5-410 and UFC 3-220-08FA, Engineering Use of Geotextiles. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200825Figure 2.12.  Comparison of Aggregate Depth Requirements. Figure 2.13.  Using Geofabric to Separate Construction Materials. 26AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 2.14.  Basic Geotextile Construction Sequence. 2.3.2.3.4.  Choosing Geotextiles. A wide range of geotextile fabr ic is available to meet vari-ous soil conditions. Selection of the proper geot extile will depend o n the actual soil andhydraulic conditions. The general soil conditions and considerations listed in  Table 2.3.should provide some in sight into selecting th e optimum material. Fu rther information aboutgeotextile uses is available in FM 5-410 and UFC 3-220-08FA. 2.3.2.4.  Other Surface Options. A number of other materials can be used to construct expedientroad surfaces. A few examples incl ude rubble, bricks, concrete blocks, timbers, and loose aggre-gate or gravel. Detailed information on expedient road construction variations can be found in FM5-430-00-1. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Table 2.3.  Soil and Hydraulic Conditions. 27Soil Condition Graded Gravels and CoarseSands Sands and Gravels with Lessthan 20% Fines Consideration The use of very open monofilament  or multifilament woven materialsmay be required to permit high rates of flow and a low risk of blinding.  This very "dirty" or si lty sand and gravel mate rial requires the use ofopen monofilament woven fabrics and need le-punched nonwovenmaterials with large openings to reduce the risk of blinding.  For thin,heat-bonded nonwoven geotextile s and thick needle-punched,nonwoven geotextiles, filtration tests should be performed. Soils with 20% to 60% Fines  When silt or silty sa nd soils are invo lved, filtration tests should beSoils with Greater than 60%Fines Silts with Sand Seams Gap Graded Cohesionless Soils  With these types of soils, consider  using a uniform sand filter with aperformed on all fabric types.  If dealing with silt  or clayey silt type  soils, heavyweightneedle-punched and heat-bonded nonwoven geotextiles tend to workbest as fines will not  pass.  If blinding does o ccur, the permeability ofthe blinding cake would equal that of the soil. woven monofilament as a filter for the sand. Consider using a uniform sand filt er over the soil with a wovengeotextile to prevent mo vement of the filter sand; alternatively ,consider using a heavyweight (t hick), needle-punched nonwovendirectly against soil as  water can flow latera lly through the geotextileshould it become locally clogged. 2.4.  Expedient Drainage Construction and Repair. Removing surface water  and water runoff awayfrom roads, buildings, and other structures is critical  during disasters or after an attack. The use of cul-verts, ditches, and other drainage  methods may be necessary to prev ent erosion of key building founda-tions and roadways or to clear floodwaters from housing and industrial areas. 2.4.1.  Expedient Culvert Designs: Expedient culverts can be cons tructed from a wide varie ty ofmaterials. A few of the more common variations include sand bags,  pierced steel planks, and emptyoil, gasoline, or asphalt drums. Culverts constructed of timber or logs are usable in the field as tempo-rary measures until structures that are more permanent can be employed. In both of these instances, anarea equal to the end area of an appropriately sized corrugated metal pipe (CMP) or concrete pipe out-let, on the same slope, can be used for hydraulic capacity. 2.4.1.1.  Oil Drum Culverts (Figure 2.15.). When empty drums are used, the capacity of the cul-verts can be assumed to be equivalent to the same diameter CMP set at a comparable slope. Note:If using drums as culverts, take extreme care when using a cutting torch to remove the lids. Jointsbetween drums should be welded solid. However, if this cannot be accomplished, tack welds canbe used if provisions are made to seal the join ts to prevent the culvert water from saturating thesurrounding fill material. 28AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 2.15.  Expedient Oil Drum Culvert. 2.4.1.2.  Log or Timber Box Culverts. When constructing a log or a timb er culvert, the covershould be greater than the top width of the box (see Figure 2.16.). Joints should be as tight as prac-ticable and, if plausible, covere d with some type of sealing ma terial (such as plastic  sheeting,asphalt, or tar) to prevent water seepage. If such  material is not available, caulk with leaves andbrush. If logs are to be  used, in order to obtain maximum  structural strength, logs should betrimmed where required to ensure  proper seating and securely fastened with spikes or driftpins(see Figure 2.17.). In order to reduce j oint openings, always lay logs  butt to tip. To prevent themovement of soil through log openings, double-layer the top logs with burlap or brush. This stepalso applies to culverts made of sandbags and pi erced steel planks if a  paved surface is not used(see Figure 2.18. and Figure 2.19.). Note: A minimum cover of three  feet over a culvert of thistype is required. 2.4.2.  Open-Ditch Design. From an expedient construction perspe ctive, the shape of a ditch is usu-ally governed by the engineer equi pment available. The road grader  will probably be the most com-mon heavy equipment item used. T riangular ditches are appropriate for most  situations; they can besymmetrical or nonsymmetrical. If  large quantities of runoff are probable, a trapezoidal ditch can beexcavated. Do not be conservative  when it comes to sizing drainage ditches; an  oversized ditch willcause much less problems than one that is too small. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 2.16.

Expedient Metal Plank Culvert. 2.4.3.  Deflectors. To remove water off the surface of an expedient road, a deflector can be installed.Deflectors are particularly effective on sloping roads and help to  stop channeling and rutting of theAFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200831road surface. A deflector is simply a piece of rubber belting 3/8- to a 1/2-inch thick fastened betweentreated timbers. An unserviceable ar resting barrier tape could also be  used if a flat  rubber belt is notavailable. The timbers are buried at a slight angle across the roadway with only about 3 inches of thebelt exposed (see Figure 2.20. and Figure 2.21.). As water runs down the surface of the roadway, it isintercepted by the belt and is dispersed off to the side. It is common practice to place riprap at the dis-persal end of the deflector to prevent erosion of the shoulder and side slopes of the road. Figure 2.20.  Typical Deflector Installations. Figure 2.21.  Deflector Construction Details. 2.4.4.  Open Top Culverts. The open top culvert ( Figure 2.22.) is another way to remove surfacewater away from the surface of roads. This method consists of a “U” shaped wooden trough made oftreated lumber. This trough is installed flush with  the roadway surface and  angled 30 to 45 degreesdowngrade. The outlet end of this  type of culvert should extend  beyond the edge of the road, andriprap should be placed at the outlet end to prevent erosion. This type of culvert generally requires reg-ular maintenance; consequently, it should only be used on roadways with minimum grades. If treatedlumber is not readily available, an open culvert can also be fabricated using natural material as shownin Figure 2.23. where logs were employed. 32AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 2.22.  Typical Open Top Culvert Example. Figure 2.23.  Open Culvert Built Using Logs. 2.4.5.  French Drains. The purpose of a  French drainage syst em is to carry unwanted freestandingwater away from a building. French drains, also  known as blind drains, ar e commonly installed nearthe perimeter of a structure at the lowest point where standing water is found. The system may termi-nate at any point where the water will not drain back toward the building. Installing a French drain isusually a simple, but labor -intensive, project. However, obstacles such as tree roots, boulders , andunderground utilities, can make the project difficult and time-consuming. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008332.4.5.1.  French drains are normally  shallow systems that function on the principle of gravity. Assuch, to be effective, the drain must slope downward with a minimum recommended slope of 1/4inch per foot. If the adjacent  ground grade runs upward along the drain path, dig deeper to main-tain a downward slope. 2.4.5.2.  In general, French drains are constructe d by filling a ditch or  trench with broken orcrushed rock (see Figure 2.24.). The top surface of the rock may be left exposed so the trench willact as a combination drain or the rock may be c overed by a relatively impe rvious soil so that nosurface water can penetrate. The latter is the general practice. Normally, French drains are not rec-ommended for permanent construction because they have a tendency to silt up with prolonged use.In field construction, such drains are often used  as a substitute for perfo rated or open joint pipesbecause of logistical limitations on piping or on filter materials suitable for use with such piping.However, it is advisable to use a French drain  with a perforated land drain in the bottom, whichmay also be wrapped in a layer of this geotextile fabric to ensure longer life by stopping any finesfrom clogging the system. In areas  with severe drainage problems,  multiple perforated pipes canbe run together to act as water  collectors or interceptor drains. This wa y, water is carried awaymore quickly when the surrounding earth is saturated. Figure 2.24.  Open French Drain Without Pipe. 2.4.5.3.  French Drain Construction Details. The basic procedure for installing a French drainthat includes perforated pipe is as follows. However, keep in mind, a system can also be installedwithout piping and geotextile fabric, but its longevity may be greatly reduced due to silt transfer.From the beginning point of th e drain, dig a trench about 12 inches deep and  approximately 8inches wide. If the ground slopes upward, dig deep er from the starting point to maintain a down-ward slope. Line the cavity with a geotextile, leav ing sufficient excess to allow it to overlap thesubsequent piping and fill material . Next, pour in about 2 inches  of rock (pea gravel or crushedstone). Lay a 4- to 6-inch perforated pipe over the rock with the perforations facing down. If per-forated pipe is not available, fabricate a substitute from lumber as shown in Figure 2.25. Once thepiping has been installed, place  another 2 inches of rock in th e opening to completely cover thepipe and fold the remaining geotextile over the stone in order to encapsulate the drain field. Lastly,34AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008back fill with soil (about  2 inches) and plant grass.  Note: Water entering the tre nch will have torun to a suitable drain-of f point, and in most cases, this is  a soakaway or watercourse. However ,rainwater should never be discha rged into a cesspool  or septic tank, and foul drai nage shouldnever be discharged into a French drain or soakaway. Figure 2.25.  Improvised Drain Line. 2.4.6.  Soakaway: A soakaway is simply a hole in the ground filled with rubble and coarse stone witha drainage pipe laid into it to aid in removing surface (rain) water from other areas. The soil in whichthe soakaway is placed must be  granular with good dr ainage properties. A  soakaway should not beused in clay soils. Most local authority regulations dictate soakaways be located at least 15 feet fromany habitable building. The  pipe flowing to them should be at least 3 inches in diameter , however, a4-inch pipe diameter is the recommended size. This pipe should be laid to a fall of 1 in 40. The size ofthe soakaway should be a minimum of 3’ x 3’ x 3’ below the bottom of the incoming pipe. The stonefill should surround the pipe and finish approximately 4 inches above it. As indicated in Figure 2.26.,an impervious layer should then be placed on the stone. Materials such as thick polyethylene, tarpau-lin, or even a bed of conc rete (A1) are recommended. Topsoil can then be placed on top of this layerto restore the garden level (A). AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 2.26.  Typical Soakaway. 352.4.7.  Vertical Wells. Vertical wells are sometimes constructed to permit trapped subsurface water topass through an impervious soil or rock layer to a lower, freely draining layer of soil. Additional wellsare driven if drainage is obstructed or the pocket is drained with an easily maintained lateral sub-drainsystem. Vertical wells are often used in northern latitudes to permit fast runoff from melting snow toget through the frozen soil and reach a pervious stratum. Under such conditions, the bottoms of thesewells are treated with calcium chloride or a layer of hay to prevent freezing. 2.5.  Drainage System Erosion Control and Maintenance. Erosion presents many difficult problems indesigning and maintaining open channels. Erosion tends to change the shape of channels, which can causetroubles near structures such as  roads, bridges, and  culverts. Additionally, erosion presents problemswhen the displaced material is deposited in undesi red locations. The primary cause for erosion is thevelocity of the water in the channel. The principle method for preventing erosion is to lower the velocityin the channel below the soil erosion velocity. 2.5.1.  Controlling Velocity. Velocity is dependent on the slope  of the channel. If the slope isincreased, the velocity increases. One method of decreasing the velocity of the water in a channel is todecrease the slope. Channel velocity  is also affected by the shape  and depth of the channel. Makingthe ditch wider and shallower increases the surface area. The larger surface area causes greater frictionand lowers the channel velocity. Since constructing a new ditch at a different slope is impractical, aneffective alternative is to construct a check dam. Check dams are the most common structure used toreduce velocity in ditches that have longitudina l grades not exceeding 8 percent. They work bydecreasing the slope of the water  surface. Eventually soil is depo sited on the ditch bottom and theditch slope itself is decreased. Check dams should be considered when the slope ranges between 2 and8 percent. Channels with slopes of 2 percent or  less generally do not require  extensive erosion con-trols. Usually with slopes in excess of 8 percent, it is more economical to pave the ditch with asphalt. 2.5.2.  Constructing Check Dams. Check dams may be constructed  of timber, sandbags, concrete,rock, or similar materials. They should extend at least 24 inches into the bottom and sides of the ditch,and the ditch top should be  at least 12 inches above  the top of the dam. The  effective height of thecheck dam should be at least 12 inches, but not mo re than 36 inches. An ap ron of rubble or riprapshould extend at least 4 feet from the face of the check dam on the discharge side to prevent erosion.36AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008A weir notch must be cut in the top of the chec k dam with a capacity lar ge enough to dischar ge theanticipated runoff to prevent water from cutting around the edges of the dam. Figure 2.27. shows twoviews of a check dam. Figure 2.27.  Typical Check Dam With Weir Notch. 2.5.3.  Check Dam Maintenance: Erosion around the dam is the  most common problem associatedwith check dams. The primary cause for this situation is that the weir notch is too small or is cloggedwith debris causing water flow over the top of the dam. This situation results in erosion where the damis anchored into the ground (see  Figure 2.28.), and if left uncorrected  over time, will often result inmore damage to adjacent structures than if the dam was never installed. 2.5.4.  Using Riprap and Rubble. By increasing the effective roughness of a ditch, ditch soil erosionis decreased. One easy way of doing  this is with riprap and rubble ( Figure 2.29.). This methodinvolves placing rocks or rubble in  the ditch bottom to provide a pr otective cover over the soil. Nor-mally, rocks should be lar ger than 6 inches to  assure stabilization. Furthermore, they should behand-placed and compacted individually in at least  two layers. The riprap not o nly prevents erosion,but will also tend to decrease the velocity in the channel. This makes it useful for lowering velocitiesin sections of channel when ma king transitions to so il ditches from paved or other high-velocityditches. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200837Figure 2.28.  Dam Erosion Caused by Weir Notch Debris. Figure 2.29.  Riprap-Lined Drainage Ditches. 2.5.5.  Using Turnouts on Roadside Ditches. If hilly terrain is  encountered during the constructionof expedient roads, erosion in the supporting drainage ditches may be a problem. As addressed previ-ously, one method of fighting such erosion involves us ing riprap, but the us e of turnouts might bemore effective. Turnouts are channels cut from the roadside ditches to adjacent areas that can handlelarger runoff quantities. Attempt to have collected water spread over an open land area. Refrain fromdiverting the water directly into nearby streams or lakes. Figure 2.30. shows a typical turnout arrange-ment and a chart that indicates the spacing of turnouts in respect to the grading of the road. 38AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 2.30.  2B22BTurnout Layout and Spacing Requirements. 2.5.6.  Constructing Headwalls and Wingwalls. Headwalls and wingwalls  are constructed to pre-vent and control erosion, guide water into a culvert, reduce seep age, and hold the end of a culvert inplace. Figure 2.31. illustrates three types of expedient headwalls. Headwalls, also known as retainingwalls, are always employed at the upstream end of a culvert. Nevertheless,  they can also be useddownstream where steep grades are involved to support and protect the soil mass at the end of the cul-vert and to hold the culvert sections in place. They should be constructed of materials as durable as theculvert. Sandbags or rubble can be used in emergency situations. 2.5.6.1.  Headwalls. The inlet end of the pipe should be extended so that a minimum-sized head-wall is required. Headwalls should not protrude above the shoulder grade and should be located atleast two feet outside the shoulder to avoid becoming traffic hazards. 2.5.6.2.  Wingwalls. Wingwalls are required to channeliz e water and prevent washing out ofheadwalls. They are set at an angle to the headwall to further support the surrounding fill and helpdirect the water flow. Their height should prevent embankment mate rial from spilling into thewaterway. The log headwall, shown as (3) in Figure 2.31., includes wings. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200839Figure 2.31.  Expedient Headwall Examples. 2.5.6.3.  Alternatives. Headwalls and wingwalls ar e costly to build in  both time and materials.When possible, avoid this ef fort by extending the outlet a minim um distance of two feet beyondthe toe of the fill. In addition, the area directly beneath the pr ojecting culvert should be well pro-tected by erosion-resistant material such as sandbags or rock riprap. Riprap should consist of rocknot less than 6-inches in diamet er. Riprap should be tw o layers deep on the sides of the channel.Riprap under the culvert outfall should be at least three layers deep (see Figure 2.32.). Figure 2.32.  Riprap and Rubble Use When There Is No Headwall. 40AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Chapter 3  EXPEDIENT STRUCTURAL REPAIRS 3.1.  Introduction. Expedient structural repair techniques are employed by Air Force engineers to protectfixed assets following a disaster, wartime or terrorist attack, or during humanitarian assistance activities.After a wartime or terrorist attack, emergency building repair is generally limited in scope and emergencyrepairs are considered adequate when they allow  mission-critical functions to continue. During peace-time, an emergency building repair may be required as a result of a major disaster or emergency. The typeand extent of the disaster  or emergency will, to a la rge degree, dictate both th e type and extent of therecovery response. Tornadoes and hurricanes are two  of the more common natural disasters that af fectmilitary installations. In the past, Altus, Homestead, and Tinker Air Force Bases suffered heavy damagethat was similar to that of an ai rfield attack from these weather phenomena. Installations and local com-munities can also experience fires, floods, and the af fects of volcanoes. The devastation from HurricaneKatrina at Keesler Air Force Base in 2005 (Figure 3.1.) reinforces the necessity for engineers to have theskill-sets required to expediently repair the damage generated by such storms. Figure 3.1.  Building Damage From Hurricane Katrina at Keesler AFB (2005). 3.2.  Overview. This chapter concentrates on common technique s used to make expedient or emer gencyrepairs to damaged structures—either civilian or military. Emergency repairs of critical facilities normallyinvolve debris removal; demolition and/or shoring and expedient structural patching of roofing, structuralopenings, and exterior sheathing. The  topics presented in this chapter  consist of repair considerations,area clearing and safing practices, debris clearing opera tions, structural shoring, and facility expedientdamage repair. 3.3.  Repair Considerations. Expedient repair of facilities must  be viewed from a common sense per-spective. The following considerations should form the basis for facility repair activities. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008413.3.1.  Safety. Wartime and contingency environments  are hazardous enough without endangeringpersonnel through unsafe  acts during repair activities. S tructures may be weakened, live electricalwires may be down, explosive gas vapors may be pres ent, chemical or biological contamination maybe prevalent, and unexploded ordnance may litter the installation. Air base medical facilities may becrowded with casualties, and civil engineer (CE) manpower will probably be at critical levels. Theseconditions make it essential that resources are not further taxed by injuries caused through neglect ofsafety practices. Enthusiasm for getting the job done must be temper ed with a prudent assessment ofthe risks. Time should be taken  to make a preliminary  survey of any suspect structures before anyrepairs are attempted. Also, when civil engineers provide assistance to off-base civilian facilities dur-ing a major disaster, they may be faced with various types of structures and hazards that are not com-mon to their installation environment. 3.3.2.  Expediency. All engineer efforts immediately following an emer gency should be limited tominimum-essential repair of crucial facilities. W ork performed should c oncentrate on functionalrather than cosmetic repair. All structural repair efforts should be geared toward making a facility safefor occupancy and providing minimal protection from the elements. 3.3.3.  Mission. The importance of the facility to the overall base mission determines the repair prior-ity. Damaged facilities housing activities that are not essential to the base mission and do not presenta hazard should be left as they are until time and resources permit conventional repairs. 3.3.4.  Practicality. Considerations of other re lated repair activities af fecting the facility should betaken into account. For example, if the facility pr ovides service to aircraft  and all access pavementsare so severely damaged that they cannot be made usable for days, the structural repair can wait. Sim-ilarly, if the supporting utility systems to a facility are far beyond emergency repair, the structural por-tion of the repair effort can be delayed. On the other hand, lack of full utility service does not mean abuilding will be totally useless. A facility with partial utility service, electricity but no water for exam-ple, can still be used for its wartime purpose. The da mage control center will have to make the deci-sion as to the practicality of repair. 3.3.5.  Flexibility. Flexibility is essential to any expedient repair effort—including ones of a structuralnature. During war, expect repair priorities to ch ange; engineer efforts must adjust accordin gly. Asmight be expected, no two attacks will be identical; therefore, no two sets of structural repair taskingswill be identical. Even during peac etime contingencies, engineer forc es must not get locked into astandard set of facility priorities and spend a lot  of time on minor repairs to the detr iment of othermore pressing requirements. For example, emergency repairs to a power generating plant may provemore important at some point in time than minor repairs to either an installation command and control(C2) center or other normally high-priority facility. 3.4.  Area Clearing and Safing Practices. Area clearing and safing are im portant considerations whenaccomplishing any type of repair, but they are es pecially important with regard to  expedient repairs fol-lowing an emergency. Below are some common safety considerations and hazards that may be encoun-tered. 3.4.1.  Safety Considerations. Working smartly and safely is vitally important during area clearingoperations. Disease-causing contaminants and structural damage  could present s ome unusual healthand safety problems for workers. 42AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 20083.4.1.1.  Disease-Causing Contaminants. Some buildings affected by conventional attacks, hur-ricanes, or contaminated floodw aters have walls, insulation, fl oors, and ventilation systems thatcan become breeding grounds for disease. Build ing materials can exhibit a wicking ef fect thatdraws water into and up the walls—as much as 3 feet above the water line. Even if workers do notbecome contaminated while rep airing the facility, the occupants  working in the buildings after-wards may quickly become seriously ill as the pa thogens grow and become  airborne. If time isavailable, make sure that the work area and criti cal facilities are free of  contaminants, even if itrequires ripping out wallboard, fl oor covering, and insulation. Cons ider hosing off contaminantswith clean water or disinfectant at the work site. 3.4.1.2.  Structural Damage. As emergency repairs are underw ay, efforts may grind to a haltshould the building incur further consequential structural damage by wind and water after the ini-tial onslaught. When sheetrock becomes wet, it loses strength and becomes heavier. The additionalweight and loss of stre ngth can cause further damage or coll apse. If repairs are delayed, providetemporary protection and early cleanup to avoid ad ditional damage. Shoring  procedures that arecovered in paragraph 3.6. may also be necessary. 3.4.2.  Hazards. Whether on or off base, not all hazards are identified and not all hazards are quicklycleared. Problems could arise when setting up for em ergency repairs even after first responders havebeen through the facilities. 3.4.2.1.  Electrical Hazards. Electrical wires are usually a problem following bomb damage, hur-ricanes, tornados, or floods. Th e wires are vulnerable and are  easily knocked down. They can beespecially hard to see at night and may not have been made safe by others. A generator poweringa nearby work site can send power through damaged electrical systems and reenergize wires at thework site. When working in this type of environment, be on the lookout for loose wires and makesure that main power panels are off before entering a building for emergency repair. This is espe-cially important when working on metal roofs or metal structures situated near damaged electricallines. The power distribution system damage depicted in Figure 3.2. is typical of what one mightexpect to encounter after a larger category hurricane. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200843Figure 3.2.  Hurricane Damage on St. Thomas, Virgin Islands (1995). 3.4.2.2.  Gas Hazards. Gas explosions and fires can cause fatalities. Containers and tanks can bedisplaced by winds and  floods. Compressed gas tanks and dr ums carrying chemicals are oftenfound in facilities. These containe rs can easily penetrate buildi ng walls as they are moved aboutby high winds and flood waters. Be alert for leaking  gas from tanks or ruptured utility lines, andpay particular attention to smells when around buildings. An extremely offensive, garlicky odor isusually associated with mercap tans, a class of sulf ur-containing compounds added to natural orbottled gas. Even moderate damage can turn deadly when leaking gas is involved. An ozone smellor a peculiar odor suggest ing that of weak chlorine may indi cate that there ar e arcing electricalwires. 3.4.2.3.  Biological Hazards. Biological hazards can be a problem after an attack. An example ofthis hazard would be a terrorist  use of anthrax or smallpox. Natura l biological hazards are also aproblem for civil engineers conducting emergency repairs after floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes.Hazardous wastes can also be a major problem afte r floods and other natural disasters. Floodwa-ters or debris may expose rotting animal carcasses and sewage that contain pathogenic microbes,viruses, bacteria, and fungi. 3.4.2.4.  Animal and Insect Hazards. Live animals and insects can be  just as dangerous as theeffects of dead animals during floods. Animals, re ptiles, and insects often take refuge withinbuildings that have been damaged. Snakes and venomous insects can be especially problematic incoastal areas affected by floods and hurricanes. 3.4.2.5.  Asbestos and Lead Hazards. Exposure to asbestos and lead can  be a problem, espe-cially when the work area has been badly damaged by an explosion or windstorm. Flying debris orblast waves can expo se enclosed areas of buildings wher e brittle asbestos wa s previously con-cealed. Previously encapsulated asbestos shingles, wallboard, plaster, insulation, or stucco canfracture and disperse  asbestos fibers (see  Figure 3.3.). While recent ba se control and removalefforts may limit exposure  to asbestos on the in stallation, off-base facilities could cause seriousexposure problems. 44AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 3.3.  Examples of Asbestos Use in Construction. 3.5.  Debris Clearing Operations. A major disaster or enemy attack  could generate vast amounts ofdebris (Figure 3.4.). When clearing debris from work areas  and facilities, provide enough room aroundthe facility to allow access for high-reach trucks, cranes, ladders, or scaffolding that may be required dur-ing the repair. Make sure utility and telephone cables are  removed or completely isolated from the workarea. Wires, cable, metal fences, pipes, and roofs  can become energized and cause electrocution if con-tacted by hot power lines. At times it is safer to remove damaged building parts when it is extremely dan-gerous to repair the component. This is often the case with heavy hangar doors when dislodged from theirtracks after an explosion or windstorm. Doors of this type normally  require special equipment and train-ing to allow recovery or repair. However, large doors or smaller hangar door sections may be valuable astemporary replacement wall sections if equipment is available to safely move them. Always clear out haz-ardous materials and debris, especially wet debris. If immediate repairs cannot be made to walls or roofswith plywood, protect the area with tarps and/or plastic sheeting. Keep in mind that little adjustments canmake the job much more manageable. For example, cleanup is easier when debris can be tossed through ablown out wall or window before repairs are made. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200845Figure 3.4.  Debris Clearing After Hurricane Andrew at Homestead AFB (1992). 3.5.1.  Debris Removal Priorities. The priorities for debris removal will va ry depending on basemission and type of disaster. The Emergency Operations Center (EOC), or the on scene commander inthe case of military response to a civilian emergency, assigns debris removal priorities. In the instancewhere damage is limited to a military complex,  debris removal personnel should expect the EOC toassign the highest priorities to the areas most critical to the mission. 3.5.2.  Debris Removal Resources. As might be anticipated, the type  of equipment required to clearan area is related to the size and amount of debris. Large pieces of wreckage will necessitate the use ofheavy equipment such as bulldozer s and cranes. If equipment is s carce, areas with lar ge amounts ofsmaller-size debris may be cleared with hand tools. The following equipment items can be effective indebris clearance operations. 3.5.2.1.  Crane. For removing extremely large chunks of debris, a crane may be the only suitablepiece of equipment. A crane can clear destruction on upper floors of a structure beyond the reachof a excavator or front-end loader. 3.5.2.2.  Bulldozer. A bulldozer has the power to push large pieces of debris out of an area and canquickly clear large areas of smaller debris (see Figure 3.5.). One skilled dozer operator can clearan area that would require several hours of labor if done by hand. However, bulldozers may be inshort supply if runway repair is required. 46AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 3.5.  Debris Clearing After Volcano Eruption in the Philippines (1991). 3.5.2.3.  Front-End Loader. Front-end loaders are especiall y useful in loading  debris on dumptrucks and other vehicles  for removal from the site. They al so are adequate for clearing pavedareas and streets of large amounts of small debris. 3.5.2.4.  Dump Truck. Dump trucks haul debris to disposal  sites; however, after an attack, likebulldozers, they are essential vehicles in airfi eld damage repair activities and may be availableonly in limited numbers for debris removal. Other suitable vehicles, such as cargo trucks and trac-tor-trailer units, can sometimes substitute for them. 3.5.2.5.  Sweepers. Once larger debris is removed from an  area, street sweepers are employed toclear smaller items from aircraft operating surfaces and primary access streets. If sweepers are notused, small metal items left on ro adways and working areas can cause tire damage to equipmentinvolved in cleanup operations. Time spent repairing and replacing flat tires on these vehicles onlyserves to further delay the overall recovery effort. 3.5.2.6.  Towing Devices. Steel cable, chains, hooks, and similar items can be fashioned into tow-ing devices for debris removal. 3.5.2.7.  Hand Tools. Various types of hand tools are useful in debris cleara nce. Chainsaws andaxes can be used to cut fallen tr ees into smaller sections for easier removal. Shovels are useful inloading smaller debris on vehicles for transport to a disposal site. Brooms and rakes can be used toclear surface areas of scattered debris. 3.5.2.8.  Manpower. The amount of CE manpower required  to clear an area  of debris will bebased upon the availabilit y of the labor -saving equipment discussed in th e previous paragraphs.Obviously, if mechanical equipm ent is available, fewer person nel will be needed for cleanup.However, personnel assigned to cleanup detail must be skilled in the operation of equipment. Lessequipment means a greater number of persons required, but their skill levels need not be as high.During recovery operations on a military installa tion, in all likelihood, the EOC will task otherinstallation agencies, whose post-attack missions may not be critical to aircraft generation, to sup-ply augmenters for debris removal efforts. In such instances, CE personnel will have to supervisethese individuals during debris removal activities and provide them with necessary tools and pro-tective gear such as gloves. Also, remember the augmentees may not be cognizant of the dangersAFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200847involved with debris removal nor be trained in explosive ordnance reconnaissance; therefore, theirtaskings should be assigned with these limitations in mind. 3.5.3.  Debris Removal Operations. The debris removal operation is  dictated by available equip-ment, manpower, and common sense. In the period immediately following a disaster or enemy attack,the EOC or on scene commander  will make decisions regardi ng how debris removal operationsshould proceed. Debris in nonessential areas will  be left until additional re sources become availableunless it hampers recovery operations or poses a sa fety hazard. Personnel  will be assigned debrisclearance tasks, and equipment will be allocated on a priority basis. 3.5.3.1.  Removal Preparations. This step consists of establis hing debris removal crews, posi-tioning equipment for removal activities, attaching cables and other devices to lar ge pieces ofdebris, breaking or cutting up lar ger debris pieces for ease of removal,  and similar actions. Anydebris salvageable for recovery operations should be set aside. 3.5.3.2.  Removal and Disposal. Under certain circumstances, the debris may be pushed into cra-ters, or prepared holes, and buried. When debris is not buried or otherwise disposed of at the sceneof destruction, it is moved to a  central location where it is loaded into dump trucks or other vehi-cles for transport to a remote location for burial or burning. The local environmental flight shouldbe consulted before establishing any landfill or debris-burning operation. 3.6.  Structural Shoring. Once debris has been removed and safe access is assured, the first concern instructural repairs should be shoring any weakened areas to restore a minimum degree of structural integ-rity to the facility. Immediately after an attack or natural disaster, there may not be time to make a detailedengineering analysis on structural soundness. Instead, rely on field experience, facility appearance, com-mon sense, and instinct. If a facility appears beyond repair, demolition is probably in order. On the otherhand, once it is determined to "save" a facility and the areas in need of repair have been identified, thereare numerous shoring and patching repair options available. Most require relatively common engineeringmaterials readily available on base or from off-base vendors. Examples include guying, bracing, jacking,splinting, tension ties, stitching dogs, and welding. 3.6.1.  Guying. Guys are usually fashioned from wire rope and tensioned by turnbuckles, if available.Guy wires are commonly found providing stabilizing support for power poles and tall antennas. Guysare normally installed to function  in opposing pairs to pr ovide lateral restraint from such forces aswind or ice loading. They  are particularly effective when damage has been sustained to end walls orsidewalls, yet roof members have been essentially untouched. Depending upon the situation, they canbe installed either inside or outside a facility. The number of pairs required will depend upon the situ-ation at hand, based upon the size of the facility being shored and extent of damage sustained. 3.6.1.1.  Although a number of dif ferent wire rope fittings are avai lable commercially, by far themost common means of attachment of wire rope  guys is the use of wire rope clips ( Figure 3.6.).When properly installed, clips can provide up to 80 percent of the rope’s strength. The size of thewire rope dictates the number of  clips used and their spacing. A  good rule of thum b is to use aminimum of three clips spaced about  3- 3/4 inches apart for 1/2- or  5/8-inch rope, and four clipsspaced 4- 1/2 inches  apart for  3/4- or 7/8-inch rope. These st andard practices prevent kinking ofthe rope and fraying of the cable  due to friction when it is connect ed to a turnbuckle or otherattachment. Also, note how the clips are attached to the rope. The bend of the U-bolt compressesthe dead end of the rope, whereas the clip compresses the live end of the rope. The live end of therope leads back to the structure that is being guyed. 48AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 3.6.  Installation of Wire Rope Clips. 3.6.1.2.  Figure 3.7. illustrates a typical guy wire connectio n to a structure.  The wire rope isattached to a turnbuckle that is attached to the building. This particular example shows a connec-tion to a steel beam using a beam clip. A beam clip is merely a C-shaped connector that can be fab-ricated in the shop, if necessary. Other connections to a structure are possible using eye bolts andeven wrapping the rope around the structural member to be stabilized. Note the use of the 2" x 4"board as a brace to prevent the guy wire from twisting as the turnbuckle is tightened. If an externalguy is to be used, one end of the guy must be  connected to a solid, immovable object, commonlyreferred to as a “deadman.” The deadman can be a nearby foundation, another part of the structureto be guyed, screw-anchors similar to what linemen use for pole guying, or even a piece of unser-viceable equipment, provided it is heavy enough. Figure 3.7.  Typical Guy Wire Connection to a Structure. 3.6.1.3.  As mentioned earlier, guys can be in stalled either internally or externally. Figure 3.8.illustrates an internal configuration. Keep in mind that guys must be tightened in pairs and concur-AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200849rently to avoid placing too much stress on the stru cture’s frame at any particular point. However,caution must be used to  prevent overtightening; the intent is to take a ll the sag out of the wireropes. Figure 3.8.  Internal Guy System. 3.6.1.4.  The external guy configuration is also installed in pairs (see Figure 3.9.). The major dif-ference is instead of using the structure itself  as the end points for the  guys, external anchors ordeadmen are used. The stabilization effect is essentially the same. Figure 3.9.  External Guy System. 3.6.2.  Bracing. Braces are compression members usually made of structural steel and heavy timbers(Figure 3.10.). Like guys, they can be installed either internally or externally. Depending upon the sit-uation, they can be placed in opp osite pairs or used individually . Regardless of the method used,ensure adequate connections to the struct ure are made. If  not well attached, the probability that thebracing will slide out  of position is great, risk ing further facility damage  or collapse. Footings forbracing require the same attention; they must be of sufficient mass so they will not move when forceis applied. Do not expect a brace  that is just shoved into the  ground to hold. If necessary , build anexpedient footing out of rubble, heavy metal, or timber if another part of the structure’s foundation, orthe foundation of an adjacent building is not available. 50AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 3.10.  Typical Brace Configuration. 3.6.2.1.  In most cases, braces will have to be installed in pairs, as shown in Figure 3.11. Like guywires, more than one pair of  braces may be required. This will  be an on-site decision, generallydriven by the size of the building being shored and severity of damage incurred. Figure 3.11.  Externally Opposed Braces. 3.6.2.2.  Internal braces are depicted in  Figure 3.12. and are also normally installed in pairs.Remember, braces must be firmly attached to the facility to prevent slipping out of position whenpressure is applied. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 3.12.  Internally Opposed Braces. 513.6.3.  Jacking. Guying and bracing usually are used to st abilize a facility from  lateral movement,keeping it from moving side to side. In some cases, the structural integrity of a facility may be jeopar-dized due to damaged structural me mbers that are more directly affected by vertical loads—in otherwords, the effects of gravity. In such situations, there may be deflected or cracked beams/girders thatneed vertical support or damaged co lumns that will eventually need replacement. Shoring jacks helpprovide expedient solutions for these types of problems. 3.6.3.1.  Shoring jack s are placed immediately under the point  of deflection, or adjacent to thedamaged column, and extende d until they are firmly  wedged into position ( Figure 3.13.). Anydebris around the base of the jacks must be cleared away so that the jacks are positioned squarelyon the facility floor. While not shown in the figure, it is also advisable to brace the jacks once theyare in position. This can be accomplished by welding two steel plates on the jacks at 90 degrees toeach other. The plates should have 3/4-inch holes drilled in them. Standard 2" x 4"s are then boltedto the plates at one end and nailed  at the other end to short pieces  of 2" x 4" stock that have beenattached to the floor of the facility using explosive actuated fasteners or suitable threaded concretefasteners. Figure 3.13.  Shoring Jack Installation. 52AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 20083.6.3.2.  In most cases, shoring jacks will be in short supply and too valuable to leave in damagedfacilities. An alternative to leaving the jacks is using timbers as supporting members, as shown inFigure 3.14. Wood and timber are extensively used to shore damaged structural componentsbecause of their availability  and economy. A variety of elemen ts can be employed, ranging fromtree logs, sawed timbers, and utility poles to industrially made items with different cross sections,such as planks, boards and beams.  The procedures for installing t imbers are similar to jacks, butare somewhat more manpower intensive. After clearing debris from the work area, a shoring jackis placed immediately adjacent to  the location where the timber is going to go. Th e jack is thenraised until it reaches the desi red height, or it can no longer be  extended. Measure the distancefrom the top of the jack to the floor and cut th e timber 1/2-inch shorter than the measurement.Once cut, the timber is raised into position and several wedges are pounded into the 1/2-inch gapbetween the top of the timber and the damaged b eam; this secures the timb er into position. Theshoring jack is then lowered and  removed. The final step is to brace the timber in two directions,similar to what was done earlier with nails and 2" x 4" stock. 3.6.3.3.  Timber shoring can also be used for expedient repair of damaged load-bearing walls withopenings, such as windows or doors.  The use of timber to take the  vertical load from a damagedmasonry pier between two windows is shown in  Figure 3.15. Note that bracing  is used betweenthe vertical timbers in each window opening. Th is common construction technique increases theefficiency of the timbers by reducing their potential for buckling under any increases in load. Also,spreader beams have been placed  at the top and bottom of the ti mbers where they meet the win-dow frames. These beams spread the vertical load over a larger surface area, decreasing the chanceof punching through or sh earing the window frame.  Spreader beams can be made from planks,boards, or even steel plates. The wedges shown are used to secure the vertical timbers in position.One final note concerning the us e of timbers; if heavy timbers  are not readily available, beresourceful. Other facilities that have been  damaged beyond repair may contain salvageable tim-bers. Also, consider nailing, gluing, bolting, or banding 2" x 8" or 2" x 10" stock together to formusable substitutes. Figure 3.14.  Timber Column Use. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200853Figure 3.15.  Support of Damaged Load Bearing Walls With Openings. 3.6.4.  Splinting. Another method of providing basic structural integrity involves the splinting of col-umns, particularly the reinforced concrete type, that have not been seriously damaged but show signsof cracking or minor fracturing. 3.6.4.1.  One te chnique involves "sandwiching" the damaged column between two steel platesconnected by threaded rods. The plates have sl otted holes so they can be  fitted to  various sizedcolumns. In this repair, splints are placed around the column at the location of the crack(s) to pro-vide a lateral restraining force (see Figure 3.16.). If cracks are at several locations on the column,multiple splints can be used. This repair is preferable to column replacement when a damaged col-umn is still capable of carrying a significant load, because it requires less manpower and is a fasterrepair. However, if a column is severely damaged and appears near the point of collapse, columnreplacement using jacks or timber supports should be used. Figure 3.16.  Steel Plate Splint. 3.6.4.2.  A second splinting technique involves placing angle iron at the corners of a damaged col-umn and connecting the angles with steel straps (see Figure 3.17.). Steel plates should be provided54AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008at the ends of the angles to a void load-bearing problems at the  bottom of the column whe re it isattached to the slab. Figure 3.17.  Use of Steel Angles at Corners of a Damaged Column. 3.6.4.3.  A third method of splinting again uses angle iron at the corners of the damaged columns,but the angle irons are joined together  with wire rope or  similar cabling (see Figure 3.18.). Oneend of the wire rope is welded to the top of one of the angles, and the rope is tightly wound aroundthe column. The other end of the wire rope is welded to one of the angles at the base of the column.Additional welds may be made at various points to better secure the cable to the angle iron. Figure 3.18.  Use of Wound Spiral to Repair Column. 3.6.5.  Tension Ties. Some facilities at overseas locations are essentially all reinforced concrete con-struction. In such cases, slabs and beams will be  of unitary construction,  meaning that they areformed, reinforced, and poured as a  single unit. After an attack or na tural disaster, some of the slabsand beams may develop minor cracking. Tension ties are a method of providing a compressive forceon the slabs and beam s that aids in th e prevention of further cracking (see Figure 3.19.). For slabrepair, a threaded rod is anchored  to the beams on both  sides of the cracked area of the slab. Forbeams, anchor plates are bolted to  the beam on both sides of the  crack and a threaded rod is placedAFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200855parallel to the beam, connecting the two anchor  plates. Tightening the nuts on the threaded rodinduces a compressive force into the beam or slab, thereby restricting further cracking. Figure 3.19.  Tension Ties. 3.6.6.  Stitching Dogs. Yet another method of restoring structur al integrity into a cracked concreteslab is the use of "stitching dogs."  These dogs are steel bars, normally rebar , formed into a U-shapeand placed over the crack, rather like staples, as shown in Figure 3.20. The dogs should be of randomlength and variably spaced along the crack. The hol es that the dogs are inse rted into must be wellgrouted to ensure a tight fit. Figure 3.20.  Stitching Dogs. 3.6.7.  Welding. Welding steel sections back into place to restore the stability of a steel framework isa common shoring meth od. Welding repairs will usua lly be limited to a relati vely small section of afacility. To attempt more than this as an expedient  repair will take too much  time and effort. For themost part, such repairs will involve erecting scaffolding, positioning steel plate and structural shapes,and accomplishing the welding. 3.7.  Expedient Repair of Damaged Facilities. Once basic structural integrity has been restored throughstructural shoring, steps can be taken to protect personnel and essential equipment from the elements. This56AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008usually involves patching hol es in walls, roofs, and floors. Before expending resources to patch theseholes, determine if ur gent, immediate patching is required. Local climate  and prevailing weather aremajor factors. If the weather i s warm and rainfall is not a detrimental factor, some openings may be leftexposed temporarily without significant impact. On the other hand, if patching is required, there are sev-eral different types of materials and expedient techniques that can be used. 3.7.1.  Roof Repairs. It is important to recognize that some  roofs and support sy stems perform vari-ous functions. While some are simply a weather cover, others act as part of a structural frame or dia-phragm. Analyze failed sections and holes in the roof to  determine the needs for eme rgency repair.Initial efforts must focus on safety. Ensure that bracing and shoring are adequate. Secondly, eliminatehazardous hanging materials (i.e., lights, wires, cable trays, mechanical ducts, etc.) below the roof andassess the extent of damage to the roof support  system. The third and any  subsequent efforts are tocover the hole, replace damaged sections of roof covering, and strengthen the support system as nec-essary. 3.7.1.1.  Damage Assessment. Once the emergency has subsided, inspect both the top and bottomportions of the roof to make su re that the areas are sound. Be aw are that even though roof struc-tural members and the deck are intact, emergency repairs may still be needed. One example is thateven after hurricane winds subside, persistent rains can cause severe damage or building collapse.Many roofs are covered with insulation boards. High winds can leave the decking intact but blowoff felts and expose insu lation boards. Some insula tion boards soak up rain like a sponge. Theadditional dead load from  the water-soaked insulation, as well as ponding  of trapped water, cancollapse structures, especially warehouses and large hangars. If the supporting members are dam-aged, shore and brace the trusses and repair damaged supports. 3.7.1.2.  Fire-Damaged Roofing Components. Fire-damaged wood structural members must bechecked for structural integrity. Scrape the ch arred wood off the member  in various sections tocheck for the extent of damage. Fire-damaged wo od can remain in place if  it retains most of itsstructural integrity. The amount  of remaining strength will depend  on the extent of charring orexposure to high temperatures. There is no defini tive, in-place test to determine if fire-damagedwood is still structurally sound.  An engineering test and analysis  are normally required. If thestructure was modified af ter construction, such as  installing an overhead  rail, then a structuralanalysis is needed to determine if fire-damaged members are adequate. Charred wood should onlybe used if at least 90 percent of the wood cross section is not charred; and charring itself does notextend more than 1/16 inch into  the wood. Emer gency repair of fire-damaged trusses normallyinvolves scraping off the charred material and sistering a similar piece of wood onto the damagedsection, splinting the damaged area  between two sound pieces of  wood, using gusset plates (seeFigure 3.21.), or using a combination of these procedures. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 3.21.  Gusset Plate Repairs. 573.7.1.3.  Weather Tightness. Once the structural integrity is  assured you can begin returning theweather tightness to the structure. From an expedient aspect, it will be difficult to completely sealoff the building from weather, but most of the i ll effects of bad weather can be kept out. Keep inmind that many roof systems are interchangeable . An example is that  metal and wood roof sys-tems can be used with wood, metal, or precast concrete buildings. Sheets of plywood can be nailedover the opening. Sheet metal, plas tic sheeting, and even canvas can  be used in lieu of plywood.For flat roofs, sheets of plywood can be fabricated into a patch a bit larger than the hole and nailedin place. If the roof is concrete, explosive actuated fasteners or suitable threaded concrete fastenerscould be used to att ach the plywood patch. If av ailable, rolled roofing ca n then be nailed to thepatch for added weather protection.  Figure 3.22. shows personnel providing expedient roof pro-tection, in the form of plastic sheeting, on a h ousing unit at Homestead  AFB after HurricaneAndrew’s assault in 1992. Once any covering is in place, positive drainage must be maintained todivert rainwater and prevent po nding. This could involve stacki ng sandbags above the repair todivert the water or changing the sl ope at the repair itself. For lar ger areas, raise the center of thetarp or sheeting to divert water. 58AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 3.22.  Using Plastic to Cover a Damaged Roof. 3.7.1.4.  Metal Roof Repair. Metal roofs are repaired the same way as metal wall systems. Whenpossible, remove the dama ged surface material and replace wi th new or cannibalized material.Overlap the good metal roofing wi th the replacement metal roofing by at least a matching co rru-gation or rib section. Catch as many purlins as  possible for support and t ack in place with sheetmetal screws along the edges. Use caulk or construction adhesive on the  upslope side for addi-tional water protection. For large holes where purlins are too badly  damaged to allow fast repair,and where reuse and imme diate coverage is required, expediently pa tch the hole w ith similarmaterials, but provide at least 24 inches of overlap to distribute loadings. Add purlins later as timeallows. 3.7.2.  Wall Repairs. For the most part, wall repairs are similar to roof repairs, except they should besomewhat easier since the  requirement to lift all materials to ro of height is eliminated. Damage towalls can be covered with standard materials such as plywood, sheet metal, tarpaulins, and plasticsheets (Figure 3.23.). Before beginning a wall repair , ensure the structure is st rong enough to with-stand pounding from additional winds when using tarps or plastic sheeting. Shore and brace the struc-ture as described previously in paragraph 3.6., if required. Secured tarps can provide good protectionfrom rain and can withstand greate r wind loads than plastic sheeting.  Note: Usually large tarps andhigh-strength plastic sheets must be special ordered but are generally available as a construction mate-rial item. Coordinate with federal and state emergency management officials or MAJCOM personnelto obtain large tarps and sheeting. For overseas humanitarian deployments, the US Agency for Inter-national Development (USAID), Office of Foreign Disa ster Assistance (OFDA) can often providespecial sheeting for shelters. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200859Figure 3.23.  Temporary Tarpaulin Protection. 3.7.2.1.  Plastic Sheeting Protective Techniques. When plastic sheeting is used to cover a hole,size the nailing strips and plastic based on the si ze of the hole. Normally , the required materialsare: nailing strips that are at least 1" x 2" furring strips (or 12-gauge metal strips that are 1" wide),plastic sheeting that is at least  6-mil plastic or reinforced sheeting (10-mil plastic or plastic withwoven fiber is preferable), and fasteners of sufficient length to penetrate the sheathing (or at least1- 1/2 inches into the stud). Avoid black, recycled plastic sheeting if the repair will be exposed toharsh elements for more than a month due to the hi gh rate of deterioration. Use nails, staples, orscrews in wood and self- tapping metal screws  to fasten into metal  siding. To accomplish therepair, wrap plastic sheeting around nailing strips and nail the strips around the hole as a rectangu-lar frame to provide a tight plastic surface. When possible, provide 6 to 12 inches of plastic over-lap around the edges of the hole. For holes in plywood (or other nailable substrate) cut the nailingstrips 12 to 24 inches wider than the hole and cut the plastic sheeting yet another 24 inches wider.For holes in a non-nailable substrate, locate  the nailing strips over the closest undamagedwall-framing studs. Cut the plastic sheeting 24 inches wider than the nailing strip. Wrap 12 inchesof plastic around both the top and bottom nailing strips. When installed, the plastic should be flatagainst the building with the wrapped nailing strip on the outside. Position the strips and fasten inplace to the wall (or studs for non-nailable surfaces), stretching tight vertically (see Figure 3.24.).Note that both plastic sheets and tarps only provide protection against the elements. More substan-tial structural repairs are often necessary. 3.7.2.1.1.  If there are no intermedia te studs to nail into for s upport, use adhesive and tape tosecure the top and bottom edges.  If there are damaged intermediate studs, sister new studs tothe damaged studs to allow nailing strips to be fastened. 3.7.2.1.2.  Repair any miss-cuts or tears in the plastic with flexible duct tape. Use caulk to fillin larger gaps between the nailing strips and wall surface. For metal skin walls with deforma-tions, use expanding foam to fill in gaps as necessary between the metal and the nailing strip. 60AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 3.24.  Typical Plastic Sheeting Wall Repair. 3.7.2.2.  Emergency Wall Repairs on Wood Frame Structures. Wood-framed walls are typi-cally the easiest wall systems to repair. Depending on the size of the hole, the repair may be madeby replacing the damage d area in kind, repl acing a wall section, or  providing a structural ornon-structural patch. Explosions, projectiles, or debris can create similar damage in wood-framedwalls. The repair requirements will vary by the  size of hole, location, a nd wall function. Smallerholes with little damage to framing members can usually be fixed with a sheathing material (ply-wood, fiberglass, metal sheet, etc.) or plastic  sheeting. Plywood or Oriented Strand Board (OSB)sheets are normally used. Holes larger than 3 feet in diameter usually require some reframing andnew plywood/OSB. Still larger holes usually require the wall s ection to be replaced with newframing and plywood/OSB on the outside of the wall. If the damaged  wall is a shearwall, a crosswall that provides lateral support, or a load-bearing wall, a  structural frame wall having plywoodon both sides may be required. 3.7.2.2.1.  Small Hole Repair. Use plywood or OSB sheathing to repair small holes (less than3 feet in diameter) when the substrate is nailable. If possible, provide at least a 6-inch overlapover the undamaged siding. If mo re weather protection is need ed than provided by plasticsheeting, use sheathing. When the substrate is not nailable, cut the sheathing to fit between theclosest studs on both sides of the hole. Position  sheathing over the hole and fasten into a studor nailable substrate. Be sure to caulk along the edge of the sheathing before fastening in place. 3.7.2.2.2.  Large Hole Repair. Remove damaged framing for larger holes, but be particularlycareful around any load-bearing joists, beams, or wall top plates. Replace damaged or missingframing and blocking. Where sheathing is missi ng and framing is damaged, the wall usuallyrequires repair or replacement of damaged framing and new sheathing. After shoring and brac-ing adjoining walls and ceiling, replace any missing studs and top and bottom plates. Attemptto maintain normal stud spacing at 16 inches on center. For partially split or gouged studs (i.e.,60 to 80 percent of the damaged stud cross section remains) and where some sheathing is stillpresent, sister another stud to the damaged stud to strengthen  it. Apply construction adhesivebetween the damaged stud and new stud for addi tional strength. To add strength to walls thatmust withstand additional wind lo ads, apply construction adhesi ve on stud surfaces and thennail the members together. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008613.7.2.2.3.  Sheathing Repair. One emergency repair where sheathing is required is duringrepair of a structural wall, particularly where shearwalls have failed. As seen in Figure 3.25.,shear failure in plywood can be either localized to a small area that appears as a tearing patternin the plywood, or invol ve a complete fa ilure where the sheathing itself is dislodged. Whensheathing is entirely missing, add new material as necessary. To do this, remove damaged wallcovering and/or sheathing back to the nearest exposed stud. Apply 1/2-inch nominal sheathingto the studs for most walls. However, for shearwalls, use 3/4-inch plywood when available. Ifadditional nailing surface is needed for securing  the new sheathing, add  another stud to theexposed stud. When the  wall must act as a hold down for  the roof, nail the sheathing at 6inches on center vertically and horizontally, except on the top and bottom plates where nailingis at 4 inches on center . Be sure to block the  wall at sheathing edges if  it is taller than thesheathing. For additional strength and less nailing, appl y construction adhesive (meetingrequirements of APA AFG-01) on framing members near edges.  Also, if the repair will beexposed to heavy rains, cover with plastic sheeting and/or ca ulk butt joints. For shearwallswider than 4 fe et, apply plywood horizontally on both sides of the  wall. When dealing withshearwalls between floor levels,  if possible do not align plywoo d butt joints with any of thefloor joints. Instead, stagger end joints and block all edges that require nailing. For other walls,except shearwalls, apply sheathing vertically or horizontally  per standard nailing procedures.Note: Some failed shearwalls may  have been constructed with vertical sheathing. If newbuilding standards require three-by (3x) lumber at edges, consider running the plywood hori-zontally and block at all hori zontal edges. Blocking provides additional stif fness support toshearwalls. 3.7.2.3.  Emergency Wall Repairs on Masonry Structures. Emergency repair of masonry wallsis usually more time-consuming, strenuous, and equipment and material sensitive than emergencyrepairs to wood walls. Masonry walls are usually block and/or brick; however, masonry building-scomposed of rock and mo rtar walls may be encountered at some overseas locations. Use extracaution when performing emergency repairs on masonry walls. Failed masonry walls are normallymore dangerous to work  with than most other walls for seve ral reasons. This added danger iscaused by factors such as the increased dead weight of the building materials, the brittle nature ofmasonry products, and the limited ab ility to determine the actual  extent of damage by simplyviewing the apparent damage. In fact, it may not be known how or even if the wall is reinforced orwhat is holding the cracked areas together. 3.7.2.3.1.  Damage Assessment Considerations. Consider the following when assessingmasonry wall damage. While a crack may appear to be small, the wall may still fail if there isinadequate reinforcing steel to hold the crack together. Reinforcing steel is us ually in selectcells. Determine if a crack crosses reinforced cells and if the cells are still solid. If the cells donot contain reinforcing steel, determine if the crack is being momentarily held in place by fric-tion from dead loads. If such is  the case, a small shift in the  weight of a structure or groundtremors (i.e., seismic shaking from nearby move ment of heavy equipment) can cause releaseand catastrophic collapse. Keep in mind that re moval of debris, rain, snow , or wind can alsocause shifting in multistory structures and subsequent collapse. Two additional factors associ-ated with masonry walls that must be assessed include determining if the wall can be shored tomaintain lateral support when  pilasters are damaged and deter mining if the wall’s floor/roofattachments are damaged or have failed. 62AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 3.25.  Examples of Sheathing Damage. 3.7.2.3.2.  Masonry Wall Variations. Emergency repairs to mas onry structures usuallydepend on whether the wall is a structural  wall or a non-stru ctural infill wall ( Figure 3.26.).Structural walls can be infill  walls that provide lateral support  or shearwalls built into a con-crete or steel moment frame  building. Also, structural wall s can be supporting walls (andpilasters) that provide lateral and vertical support for the roof and other floors. Non-structuralwalls are usually constructed as infill walls that have wall ties to flexible frames, or they mayuse tracks or offset walls that extend past the exterior frame  and wrap around it without pro-viding lateral support. If a structural wall is damaged, emergency shoring and bracing may berequired along with repair. Once strengthened, th e wall should be closed up with injectiongrout or some other means of confinement as discussed in this chapter. Emergency repairs fornon-structural walls depend on the da mage. Typical repairs usually involve removing andreplacing damaged material and patching the open area with appropriate sheathing. Figure 3.26.  Damaged Brick Infill Wall. 3.7.2.4.  Small Hole Repair in Structural Walls. The simplest emergency repair to a masonrywall is repairing a small hole that has been punched through the wall involving no damage to theAFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200863rest of the structure. Usually , this will occu r from debris being thrown through the wall from anexterior blast or high winds. The repair method for small punched holes in masonry structures var-ies according to the type of wall involved. Th e emergency repair method for small holes cleanlypunched through a non-structural masonry wall, where only a few blocks are missing, is to simplyfasten a patch of wood sheathing over the hole. Cut a sheet of sheathing (plywood or OSB) that islarge enough to extend several in ches past the next unda maged blocks' grout joints around thehole. When positioning the patch on the outside of  the wall, apply construction adhesive to theedges of the sheathing. Next, drill holes through the sheathing and into the undamaged grout joint(or a block with a filled  cell); secure the shea thing in place with bolts , washers, and lead orexpanding anchors. Do not use th is repair method if there are  loose blocks or cracks around thehole; rather, tie the wall together with sheathing on both sides. When only a block or two are miss-ing, it is usually easier to knock out the damage d material, square up the opening to size, and fillthe void using new blocks and a fast-setting cement or epoxy grout mortar (see Figure 3.27.). Figure 3.27.  Correcting Damage With New Material. 3.7.2.5.  Large Hole Repair in Structural Walls. Structural masonry walls with lar ger holes(i.e., larger than about five blocks high and four blocks wide) or failed sections are very dangerous(see Figure 3.28.). It is usually better to shore and br ace the roof or floors above the failed areaand then work somewhere else in the facility. However, moving to another section of the buildingshould not be attempted until th e extent of the structural dama ge has been thoroughly analyzed.Failed sections in one  part of  a masonry building can often lead  to a progressive collapse in therest of the structure when wind, rain, vi bration, or shifting loads are involved. Figure 3.29. is anexcellent example of a progressive structural failure after an earthquake. There are few options formaking emergency repairs for larger holes in structural masonry wa lls. For a wartime repair of alarger hole in a shearwall or support wall, shore and brace the area around the wall, square up thehole, provide necessary bracing, and cover the hole.  Leave the shoring in place if there will becontinued blast or seismic shaking; cribbing is more stable than using a single support post. Aftershoring the area, square the hole, brace the hole with double 2" x 8" headers and side braces, anduse double 2" x 4" cross bracing.  Cover over each side with 1 or  2 layers of 3/4-inch plywood64AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008(depending on the expected shear loads). Cut sheets to run horizontally, and allow at least 8 inchesof overlap onto good masonry . Position sheets and drill holes th rough the masonry to align withthe holes in the plywood. Tie together with threaded rods, washers, and nuts. When possible, use2" x 4"s between opposing bolts to prevent the tie rods, washers, and nuts from tearing through theplywood. Figure 3.28.  Extensive Structural Wall Damage at Homestead AFB. (1992) Figure 3.29.  Progressive Structural Damage in Guam (1999). 3.7.2.6.  Structural Wall Confining. When broken blocks cannot be  replaced for a small hole ina structural masonry wall, confin ing the wall is a safe option. Th is repair should be limited tosmall holes with 7 or 8 blocks  missing and where there is no extensive cracking around the hole.Use at least 4- or 3-gauge sheet steel (i.e., about 1/4-inch thick) on both sides of the hole. Cut thesteel to provide about 8 inches  of overlap between the steel and the undamaged block. Drillthrough the sheet steel about 4 in ches from the edges in the corn ers and midpoint on each side.Next, drill through the masonry so  it will align with the holes in  the sheet steel. Next, run a beadof construction adhesive around  the hole on both sides before fa stening the sheet steel togetherwith threaded rods, washers, and nuts (see Figure 3.30. graphic sequence). AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200865Figure 3.30.  Masonry Wall Confining Sequence. 3.7.2.7.  Large Hole Repair in Non-Structural Walls. Non-structural walls with lar ge holes(i.e., up to about five blocks high and four blocks wide) can usually be repaired with a sheet of ply-wood, a couple of 2" x 8" braces , and a header. Knock out or saw-cut loose block on the top andsides of the hole to provide fairly straight edges (i.e., square up the hole). Cut one or two 2" x 8"sfor a header to fit the top of the squared hole (if overseas and metric blocks are used, use a widerheader or add 3/4-inch plywood cut as wide as the block and nailed to the top of the header). Next,cut two side braces about 1/8 inch longer than the distance from the bottom of the hole to the bot-tom of the header and place one end of the braces at the bottom of the hole on each side and drivethe top of the braces in place to  hold up the header . Once in position, toe- nail the top of eachheader. Lastly, cut sheathing and fasten in place  in the same manner as described for covering asmall hole. If desired, and for add itional rigidity, apply 1/2-inch  sheetrock on the inside facing.Additional expedient masonry wall repair procedure options, such as pressure injected epoxy andstructural steel bracing, are provided in the  Expedient Structural Repair Course on the Air ForceCivil Engineer Virtual Learning Center web site at https://afcesa.csd.disa.mil. 3.7.2.8.  Crack Repairs on Reinforced Walls. When replacing a reinforced masonry or concretewall is not feasible, an a cceptable repair is to f ill the cracks with a struct ural grout or epoxy. Inmost cases, epoxy injection works best (see  Attachment 2, Crack Repair Using Epoxy InjectionMethod). The epoxy injection method can be used to repair cracks as narrow as 0.002 inch if thereinforcing steel has not been stre ssed beyond its elastic  limit. If necessary, seal the top of thecrack with the same epoxy troweled in place or use metal plates. This type of repair generally con-sists of drilling holes at close intervals along the cracks, in  some cases installing entry ports, andinjecting the epoxy under pressure. However, for small cracks, cartridges can be used with hand-guns (see Figure 3.31.). For massive structures, an alternative procedure consists of drilling aseries of holes, usually 7/8 inch in diameter, that intercept the crack at a number of locations. Typ-ically, holes are spaced at 5-foot intervals. 66AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 3.31.  Epoxy Application. 3.7.3.  Window Repair. In an expedient sen se, there are no t too many fixes fo r damaged windows.Attempting to replace glass is much too long an ef fort and during a conflict or earthquake, is almostself-defeating since it will probably all be lost again in the next attack or aftershock. 3.7.3.1.  Repair Options. Normally, placing plywood over the  window opening is sufficient. Ifthe facility must remain  occupied and requires da ylight, then rigid plasti c sheets can be used tomaintain a visible opening. Plexiglas sheets ar e usually used for this repair . Use polycarbonatesheets if additional protection is required. Either way, it is important to first bond the rigid sheet tothe building using construction adhesive, and then clamp it to the building using a simple woodenor metal frame and screws. 3.7.3.2.  Repair Procedures. Do not drill or fasten through the  sheets if there will be additionalblasts or high winds. In stead, hold them in  place with a wooden (or metal) frame. Cut the rigidsheets 2 inches wider and taller  than the opening. Use 2" x 4"s or  2" x 6"s to frame the opening,sizing the frame to fit outside the dimension of the opening. Once the frame is configured, apply acontinuous bead of construction adhesive to the  edge of the opening to set and hold the sheet inplace. Sandwich the rigid sheet between the building and the frame and clamp in place by fasten-ing the frame to the building with screws or other appropriate (removable) fasteners. 3.7.4.  Door Repair. Damaged door openings that must remain  accessible for entry and exit are usu-ally shored and framed to keep the opening safe. To protect the opening against further damage fromwind, weather, or blast forces, use expedient measures such as stacking sandbags at the opening. Thisis especially important when the wall is a structural wall and has been damaged. 3.7.4.1.  Repair Priorities. The first priority for an emergency repair of a door opening in a struc-tural wall is to maintain the wall's structural  integrity. Shore the opening at the top, bottom, andsides. Use spreaders at the top and bottom of the door to take the place of cross bracing. If blast orwind protection is required, use sandbags stacked at the entrance and along walls (see  Figure3.32.). AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 3.32.  Sandbagged Entrance. 673.7.4.2.  Weather Tightness. If weather tightness and further  strengthening are required, con-struct a separate door. Tack the door framework to the opening to  avoid causing additional stresson any weakened structures. Make sure the conn ections to the building are relatively weak. Relyon sandbag berms or other expedient berm structures for protection against blast. 3.7.4.3.  Sliding/Roller Doors. Hangars, warehouses, and maintenance facilities are often criticalfacilities. Other than for hardened aircraft  shelters, these types of fac ilities have doors that arequite vulnerable to exterior blast and high wind s. Typical hangar-type doors are bottom rolling(sliding doors), which have top guide tracks and bottom rollers on support tracks. Different typesof large doors can be used on large facilities when blast protection is not a problem or when snowand ice are a problem. Lightwei ght doors are often used on newe r permanent or deployable han-gars and warehouses. Deployable hangars and some  newer hangars, maintenance facilities, andwarehouses may have vertical lift, clamshell, canopy, or folded-fabric lift (panel) doors. 3.7.4.4.  Heavy Metal Door Repair. Full metal, bottom-rolling doors that have come loose fromtheir tracks usually cannot be expediently repaire d. Limit repairs to patchi ng holes. If the rollersand top tracks are not damaged, some doors can be jacked up and pushed back on tracks. The fol-lowing failures require door removal and/or track repair: (1) rolling doors come loose from the toprail; (2) the doors have fallen in ward from the top when wind or  blast pressures have racked thebuilding or collapsed the metal overhead track sy stem, (3) high winds or  floods lifted or pushedthe doors off the bottom track; (4) the door ha s hung up on the upper track and torqued the walland supporting framework.  Warning: When dealing with very lar ge metal rolling doors such asthose on hangars, emergency repair is usually not feasible excep t by trained heavy repair teamssupported by cranes and other special equipment. Also, check on the door and framing specifica-tions before considering the repair of top rail s using standard shapes of A36 (36,000-psi) steel.Large steel hangar door structures often use 50,000-ps i steel and special fittings. If an A36 struc-tural shape is used and the orig inal specification was  for 50,000-psi steel, the door framing andtracks will be grossly undersized for the load. 68AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 20083.7.4.5.  Lightweight Metal and Fabric Door Repair. Because of their de sign, lighter weightdoors, such as vertical lift, clamshell, canopy, and folded-fabric lift doors, can usually be repairedin an emergency without the use of heavy equipm ent. Two deployable fabric door examples areshown in Figure 3.33. The first example is a B-1 hangar th at uses folded-fabric lift doors withlightweight framing door guides. In the clamshell hangar example, lightweight framing and tubingare used as the superstructure. Figure 3.33.  Lightweight Fabric Hangar. 3.7.4.5.1.  Structural Repairs. Bent framing on these types of  structures can usually bestraightened, bolstered with additional pipi ng, or replaced with similar common materials.Also, damaged tracks can often be straightened or detached/cut out and replaced using similarmaterials. 3.7.4.5.2.  Surface Skin Repairs. Holes in lightweight rigid co mposite panels are usuallyrepaired with a patch of 14-gauge sheet metal  fastened over the hole. Use construction adhe-sive and sheet metal screws, screw-in shield s, or expanding sleeve anchors, whichever isappropriate. Fabric panel systems can usually be quickly repair ed. Coated fabric systems areused with many portable shelters, deployable hangars, and maintenance shelters. The mostcommon coating is PVC-coated polyester. It is used with many  clamshell-type structures andfabric hangars. Larger structures may use a tensile fabric design.  Emergency repairs mustmaintain structural integrity of these larger structures. Emergency fabric repair kits are usuallyavailable from the manufacturer. If one is not available, cons ult with Fuel System Mainte-nance or Fabrication shops, as some of their shop methods and equipment are similar to man-ufacturers' recommended methods and equipment. Depending on whether the material is acover fabric or tensile fabric, there are usua lly two repair methods for fixing pierced fabricsections in walls and overhead doors: the Fabric Clamp and PVC-Coated Polyester Fabric sys-tem. 3.7.4.5.3.  Fabric Clamp Repair. Fabric clamp systems are most often used for folded fab-ric-lift doors (Figure 3.34.). The steps involved begin with  loosening screws on the fab-ric-clamp strips above and belo w the torn section. Next, cut th e repair fabric large enough tooverlap the tear by at least 2 inches on each side. Once t he repair patch is properly sized,extend the repair fabric under and between th e two clamp strips . Then, retighten the clampstrips, trim off excess material, and tack down the fabric edges with adhesive or double-sidedtape. Lastly, trim off or glue together any l oose fabric that is under the patch and around thetear. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200869Figure 3.34.  Typical Fabric Clamp Repair. 3.7.5.  Repair of PVC-Coated Polyester Fabric Systems. These systems are used with several gen-erations of shelters and hangars. T he manufacturer for each system  usually provides repair criteria;however, if criteria are not readily available, follow the general guidance here. Repairs usually requireeither a heat-welded patch (with either a heat gun  or bonding iron and a roller) or a solvent-weldedpatch (with solvent). For  coated fabric systems that have a slick,  Teflon-like coating on the exteriorsurface, patch the hole from the inside using a piece of fabric and adhesive. As with the Fabric Clampmethod, work with Fuel System Maintenance and Fabrication shop personnel to repair these types offabrics. Begin the repair by cutting and positioning a fabric patch over the torn section. For tensile fab-ric systems that distribute load, cut the patch to  extend at least 12 inches past each damaged edge,unless the manufacturer has othe r recommendations. For simple cover systems, cut the patch toextend 2 to 4 inches past each damaged edge. For heat-welded patches, provide heat between the fab-ric and the patch. Hold a piece of plywood on the inside surface and use the roller on the outside of theheated patch to roll the material together. Roll out air bubbles, keeping the temperature just under thepoint where smoke develops on the patch or the two fabrics will melt. When done properly, the resultshould look similar to that in Figure 3.35. Figure 3.35.  Typical Heat/Solvent -Welded Patch Repair. 3.7.6.  Cement and Sealer Fabric Repair. Other fabric-based deployable structures, such as theTEMPER tent and Medium/Small Shelters, are all sh eathed with a fabric outer covering over rigidframing. When damage to these units occurs, it is not always pos sible or practical to make sewnrepairs. This is especially true when a tent is erected and the damage is minor. If a hole or tear is fairlysmall and it is not located near a seam, an edge, or hardware, a cemented patch or dab of adhesive can70AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008be used to repair the damage. When a stovepipe shield is slightly damaged, sealer can be used to repairthe damage. There are specific repair kits available that have been developed by each product manu-facturer to correct minor damage. T ypical repair procedures for minor holes and tears are describedbelow. 3.7.6.1.  Small Hole Adhesive Repair. A dab of adhesive is used on a hole in a tent that measures1/8 inch or less across. To seal a small hole, first use a wire brush to clean the area around the holeand raise the nap of the fabric. Next, simply use a small stick or paddle to put a dab of adhesive onthe hole, working it into the fabr ic while being sure to  bridge the damage with the adhesive toensure a complete seal. 3.7.6.2.  Large Hole/Tear Adhesive Repair. Cemented patches are used to cover holes and tearsthat are more than 1/8 inch, but less than 4 3/4 inches across. Putting a cemented patch on a tent issimilar to patching a bicycle tire. To apply a cemented patch (see Figure 3.36.), first obtain the fol-lowing items (if not included in the repair kit): a ruler, chalk, wire brush, flat board, paddle, roller,tent-patching adhesive, and a piece of clean matching canvas. Next, measure the damage and cuta round patch from a piece of matching canvas, making sure the patch is large enough to extend 3/4 inch beyond the damage in all directions. Th en, place the board under  the damage for support.On an erect tent, another individua l will be needed inside the tent to hold the board against thedamage. Center the patch over the damage and  draw a circle with chalk around the patch, thenremove the patch. Use a wire brush to clean the fabric and raise the nap of the material inside thecircle and the patch itself. Now, position the patch facedown over the damage and use the paddleto coat the patch evenly with adhesive. Let the  adhesive overlap the edge of the patch a little sothat it forms a circle on the tent. Next, remove the patch, flatten out the canvas and the edges of thehole or tear as much as possible  and fill in the circle with a coating of adhesive. Let the adhesivedry, then apply a second coat of adhesive to the tent and to the patch. Now, wait 10 to 15 minutesfor the adhesive to become tacky (test the patch by touching it). The patch is ready to use when itis sticky. Once the adhesive reaches this point, center the patch face up on top of the damage andpress the two sticky surfaces together. Use a roller to press the excess adhesive and the air bubblesfrom under the patch. Roll first in  one direction and then in the  opposite direction. If no roller isavailable, use the can of adhesive as a roller. Be sure to tightly seal the can first. Lastly, dip the tipof one gloved finger in  the adhesive and ru n the finger around th e edge of the pa tch to seal theedge with adhesive and prevent fraying. Note: With some fabric (e.g., TEMPER tents), large tearsmust be sewn together prior to the application of adhesive or sealer. Caution: Seam sealer and sol-vent are extremely flammable and  contain toxic fumes. Do not smoke or use seam sealer/solventnear an open flame. Use seam sealer and solven t with goggles and gloves. When indoors, wear arespirator, or use in an open,  well ventilated area, aw ay from sources of  combustion. Death orsevere injury may result from explosion or fire. Inhalation of fumes may cause toxic sickness. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200871Figure 3.36.  Large Hole/Tear Adhesive Repair Steps. 3.7.6.3.  Sealer Repairs for Small Holes and Tears in Stovepipe Shields. Holes and tears instovepipe shields can be repaired with sealer. The kind of repair used depends on the extent of thedamage, as described below. A layer of silicone sealer is used to repair holes or tears that measure2 inches or less across. To make this repair, obtain cleaning materials, a dry rag, a can of siliconesealer (MIL-A-46106), and a pa ddle. Then clean and dry the da maged area thoroughly. Next,spread a 1/16-inch-thick layer of sealer on both sides of the shield, covering the hole or tear and atleast 1/2 inch on each s ide of the damage. Smooth  out the layer as evenly as possible. Brace theshield so that the sealer does not  touch anything while it is wet,  and allow the repair to dry for 4hours on a sunny day with low humidity or 6 hours on a humid day. Do not move the tent while thesealer is drying. 3.7.6.4.  Sealer Repairs for Large Holes and Tears in Stovepipe Shields. A patch  attachedwith silicone sealer is used to repair holes and tears more than 2 inches across in stovepipe shields.To make this repair (see Figure 3.37.), first obtain the following items (if not included in the repairkit): ruler, cleaning materials, a dry rag, a craftsman’s knife, a piece of matching patch material, acan of silicone sealer, and a paddle. Begin th e process by cleaning and drying the damaged areathoroughly. Next, measure the damaged area and cut a patch from material salvaged from a shieldthat could not be repaired, making sure that the patch is large enough to extend 1 inch beyond thedamage on all sides. Now, spread a layer of sealer on either the pa tch or the shield and press thepatch in place at once. Finally, spread sealer 1 inch over all edges of the patch to eliminate fraying.Do not move the shield for 4 to 6 hours. 72AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 3.37.  Larger Hole Sealer Repair. 3.7.6.5.  Additional details on fabric  repair procedures can be  obtained in the following docu-ments: FM 10-16, General Fabric Repair; T.O. 35E5-6-1, Tent, Extendable, Modular, Personnel(TEMPER); T.O. 35E5-6-11, Alaska Small Shelter System; and T.O. 35E-6-21, CalifornianMedium Shelter System. 3.8.  Conversion of Alternate Facilities. There may be some facilities which are damaged beyond expe-dient repair capabilities. If such a  facility is vital to the air base  mission, another facility must be con-verted to meet the uninhabitable facility’s role. To effectively convert another facility, engineers must beaware of the function of the destroyed structure. Equipped with this knowledge, potential alternate facili-ties can be evaluated in terms of size, utilities support, and other special functional requirements. To selector recommend the best facility for conversion, the base civil engineer (BCE) should consider two factors.First, what other structures on the installation come  closest to meeting the requirements for an alternatefacility? Second, how much work will be required to convert the facility to meet its intended use? If thereare no special considerations, the structure meetin g the functional requirements and taking the leastamount of time to convert should be selected. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200873Chapter 4  EXPEDIENT REPAIR OF WATER AND WASTE SYSTEMS 4.1.  Introduction. Timely repair of water and waste systems is essential after a disaster or enemy attackfor obvious health, hygiene, and operational reasons. Since it is impossible to predict the extent of damageto these systems during a disaster or attac k, specific priorities need to be established after  an incident.Facility priorities listed in base recovery plans are generally a s ound starting guide. However, the Emer-gency Operations Center (EOC) normally dictates repair priorities during emergencies. Bottom line—ser-vice to crucial base functions must  be restored quickly. If necessary, some creative engineering andcannibalization of non-critical systems may be required to establish or keep priority water and sanitationsystems operating. 4.2.  Overview. This chapter primarily focuses on exp edient water and waste systems repair. Addition-ally, gas line and POL system repa ir is briefly discussed. Although some  expedient repairs to water andwaste systems end up being permanent, most repairs are temporary measures that provide limited supportfor short periods. The topics presented in this chapter address expedient repair of water distribution, watertreatment, water storage, expedient water sources, sewage disposal, gas line, and POL systems. 4.3.  Water Distribution Systems. Water is an important  utility requiring quick restoration following adisaster or hostile attack. Water systems normally have a high pr iority for repair due to fi refightingrequirements, decontamination purposes, personal consumption, cooking uses, and both general and med-ical hygiene. The major components of any water supply system are source, treatment, storage, and distri-bution. Of these, the distribution network is the most extensive component of the installation water systemand is where most expedient repairs are affected. 4.3.1.  Anticipated Damage and Effects. Subterranean construction protects the distribution net-work from certain types of disasters. Its widespread layout can make it more vulnerable to other emer-gencies. 4.3.1.1.  High wind associated with a hurricane or tornado is not likely to break underground watermains, but a major enemy air attack is almost certain to disrupt some part of the dispersed layoutof the distribution network. Dama ge to the d istribution system is normally confined to pumps,valves, and water mains. Water mains may be broken in several locations resulting in easily recog-nizable leaks (Figure 4.1.) as well as numerous hidden leak s producing delayed damage in theform of undermined streets or structures. 4.3.1.2.  A water system is easily contaminated wh en water mains and sewers in close proximityare fractured. If the water mains and sewers are on a steep gradient, sewa ge may enter the watermains with enough head to flow to the consumer s' taps below. Contamination may result whenbroken mains reduce pressure within the system,  heavy draft for firefighting, valve closures, andsupply failures occurring during enemy attack or sabotage. Contamination may also be caused byfilth entering open mains through open ends or fractures during repair operations. The more com-mon diseases attributed to contaminated water are typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery. Diarrheamay also be caused by contaminat ed water. An epidemic of any  of these seriously hampers mili-tary operations. 74AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 4.1.  Obvious Water Line Break. 4.3.1.3.  During periods of conflict, a retreating enemy or terrorists may deliberately contaminatewater supply systems by placing bo ne oil, refuse, bodies, lubrica tion oils, or other materials inwells, springs, reservoirs, tanks, or the distri bution system. Consequently, measures should betaken to secure easy access points such as well points, pumping stations, and storage vessels. 4.3.2.  Expedient Repair Procedures. As soon as the situation perm its, work should be started onrestoring water supply sin ce water supply systems ofte n have a higher priority  in rehabilitation thanother utilities. Time is normally a limiting factor during base recovery, and rapid completion of the jobis by far more important than economy of labor , materials, and equipment. In making improvisedrepairs, any suitable material or  equipment available is used to me et the immediate need. A repairedwater main does not have to be l eak-proof to be functional. Expe dient repairs are improved as timeand supplies allow. Water distribution systems include pipe from 1- 1/ 2 to 24 inches in diameter andmay consist of PVC rigid plastic pi pe, steel, asbestos cement, cast iron, and ductile iron. Water pres-sure ranges from 60- to 120- psi. Most distribution lin es are considered repa irable and, therefore,efforts should concentrate on quickly reestablishing major feeder lines. As a general rule, system com-ponents, such as pumps, hydrants, valves, and purification units, are not considered expedientlyrepairable due to the time required to accomplish a fix. Suggested repair procedures for water supplysystems are listed below. 4.3.2.1.  Identify the Problem. The fi rst corrective action is to iden tify the extent of the problem.Pipes and mains, valves, and pumping stations can be located from existing utility drawings. Ifavailable, local technicians should be able to assist greatly in  this effort. Multi-frequency pipelocators and similar equipment can be used to locate otherwise hidden lines. 4.3.2.2.  Select Repair Materials. Repairs can be accomplished with cast-iron pipe with mechani-cal couplings or by using iron or steel pipe. Steel pipe is preferable to cast-iron pipe because it isstronger and lighter, can be fabricated in longer lengths, has fewer joints, and is easier to transportand handle. Fire hoses may also be used for temporary bypasses. Schedule 40 PVC piping can alsobe used as feeder lines. Plastic piping, which  normally comes in 10-foot  lengths, is very easy toassemble and modify. Mechanical couplers are  generally desirable because they are quicklyinstalled and resist vibr ation and settlement. The most common coupler s are the full circle andclosed circle types. The full  circle or open side couplers ( Figure 4.2.) are the most preferred andAFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200875recommended for water, sewer, and POL line repairs. The closed ci rcle or closed side coupler isused primarily for steam line repairs. If normal repair materials, such as couplers, are not availableto repair a broken pipe or leaking joint, other expedient line repair techniques are still available. Figure 4.2.  Typical Full Circle Couplers. 4.3.2.3.  Implement Repairs. Expedient repair to water distribution systems basically consists ofpiping. In essence, replace or repair piping syst ems with locally available materials or materialsobtained by dismantling non-criti cal systems for components. Fi rst responders will nor mallyattempt to isolate and/or bypass damaged lines. Once the damage has been assessed, make tempo-rary repairs to control water wastage, maintain essential flow, and permit the reopening of valves. 4.3.2.3.1.  Repairing Water Main Breaks and Leaks. Water main repairs should be repairedas quickly as possible. The type of repair technique that is used depends on the type of leak inthe water main. Use the procedures in  Table 4.1. as a guide for repairing water main breaksand leaks. 76AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Table 4.1.  Checklist for Repairing Water Main Breaks and Leaks. Problem Type Small Holes Joint Leaks Cracks in Main Repair Procedure Use wood plugs to stop small holes temporarily. (Replace wood plugs with permanent metal plugs at a later date.)  Temporary wood plugs can also be used to plug the ends of pipes up to 8 inches in diameter. Brace the plugs to withstand the pressure in the main. Repair joint leaks by recaulking the joint if caulking was previously used in the joint. Cracks in mains usually require that the valves be shut off in the affected area, especially in severe main breaks.  Notify the fire fighting authorities in case of main shutoff.  Repair leaks in mains using split sleeves or mechanical couplings. Split-sleeve and mechanical-joint repair fittings offer the best method for quick, effective repairs.  Several companies manufacture split-sleeve and mechanical-joint repair fittings. Split-sleeve repair method:  Insert a split sleeve over fracture or hole. Split-sleeve fittings can be installed underwater if necessary. Mechanical-joint repair method:  Cut out a section of the cracked pipe and replace it with a piece of pipe and mechanical couplings.  Mechanical couplings are manufactured by several companies for various types of repair jobs.  Consult the manufacturer’s instructions for installation methods to make the proper selection and installation.  If the break is too long for a short insertion piece, insert a whole length of pipe. When a water main is opened for repair, flush and disinfect it before returning it to service. 4.3.2.3.2.  Tapping Water Mains. After a disaster or during a contingency, it may be necessaryto tap into water mains to make expedient repairs or reroute essential service. Water mains areusually cast iron, 8 inches or more i n diameter. If the involved main is  less than 8 inches indiameter, taps should be 2 inches or smaller. Use the steps in Table 4.2. and the illustration inFigure 4.3. to tap the water main. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Table 4.2.  Steps to Tap a Water Main. Water Main Tapping Procedures 77Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 Step 5 Step 6 Step 7 Step 8 Step 9 Step 10 Step 14 Step 15 Step 16 Step 17 Step 18 Step 19 Step 11 Step 12  Drain water from cylinder through the bypass. Step 13 Dig to expose pipe at the point where tap is to be made.  Dig as close to the top of water main as possible. Clean all dirt and rust off pipe at that point. Place gasket of water main self-tapping machine on pipe, and set saddle of machine on the gasket. Wrap the chain around the pipe, and tighten it to clamp water main self-tapping machine to the pipe. Remove cap from the cylinder of machine, and place combination drill and tap in boring bar. Reassemble machine by putting boring bar through cylinder and tightening cap. Open flap valve between the compartments and start drilling hole by applying pressure at feed yoke and turning ratchet handle until drill enters the main. When tap starts threading the hole, back off the feed yoke to prevent stripping threads. Continue to turn boring bar until the ratchet handle can no longer be turned without extra force. Remove tap from the hole by reversing the ratchet.  Then, back the boring bar out by turning it counterclockwise. Close the flap valve between upper and lower compartments. Remove cap and drill tool.  Place a corporation stop in the boring bar, ensuring that the stop is closed. Repeat steps 6 and 7. Turn ratchet handle to thread corporation stop into the pipe. Repeat Step 13. Remove cap from the cylinder, and unbolt boring bar from the corporation stop. Remove lower chamber from the pipe. Inspect for leaks.  If corporation stop leaks, tighten it with a suitable wrench 78AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 4.3.  Water Main Tap. 4.3.2.3.3.  Making Temporary Repairs in Water Pipes. Although expedient repairs may noteliminate all leaks from water distribution pipes, small leaks should be repaired when the tac-tical situation or mission permits. Before making any repairs, shut off the water and relieve thepressure from the system. Pipes can be temporarily repaired using the following methods. 4.3.2.3.3.1.  Rubber Hose or Plastic Tubing. Cut the pipe on either side of the leak witha hacksaw or pipe cutter. Remove the damaged pipe section and replace it with a length ofrubber hose or plastic tubing. To do this, slip the ends over the pipe and fasten them withhose clamps. The inside diameter of the hose must fit the outside diameter of the pipe. 4.3.2.3.3.2.  Sheet Rubber. Wrap the leaking area with sheet rubber . Place twosheet-metal clamps on the pipe  (one on each side). Then, fasten the clamps with nuts andbolts. 4.3.2.3.3.3.  Electrician's Friction Tape. Wrap several layers of  friction tape around thehole or crack, extending the tape about 2 inches above and below the leak. 4.3.2.3.3.4.  Wood Plugs. Similar to water main repairs,  small holes in other water pipescan also be filled with wood plugs. Drive a wooden plug into the hole after it is drilled orreamed. The plug will swell as it absorbs wat er, preventing it from being blown out bywater pressure. 4.3.2.3.4.  Installing Temporary Piping or Hoses. These repairs may involve plugging or cap-ping fractured mains or shunti ng water around breaks with a fire  hose connected to the frac-tured pipe or fire hydrants. Ex pedient repairs could also consis t of new piping laid on theground. Replace temporary piping and hoses with more permanent repairs as soon as possiblebecause they may interfere with traffic, are likely to freeze in cold weather, and may not pro-vide sufficient supply. Figure 4.4. and Figure 4.5. give examples of typical service and water-line connections that may require repair. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200879Figure 4.4.  Service Connections to Existing Mains. 80AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 4.5.  Typical Waterline Connections. 4.3.2.3.5.  Repairing Burst Water Lines. Four examples of ways to repair a burst water line areshown in Figure 4.6. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200881Figure 4.6.  Expedient Pipe Repair Techniques. 4.3.2.3.6.  Using Dissimilar Materials. During expedient repair, the goal is delivery. As such,the piping size must be based upon the sizes that the pumps will accommodate and the materi-als available. During contingency operations pr oper fittings, material, and tools may not beavailable. Therefore, the field eng ineer may have to improvise using  dissimilar materials toeffect temporary repairs. Figure 4.7. through Figure 4.9. illustrate a few ways to accomplishpipe repairs when working with limited resources or dissimilar materials. Regardless of whattype of expedient repairs are performed, the total system will need to be disinfected when therepairs are completed. Figure 4.7.  Joining No-Hub Cast-Iron Pipe. 82AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 4.8.  Working With Flexible Plastic Pipe. Figure 4.9.  Dissimilar Materials Jointing. 4.3.2.3.7.  Thawing Frozen Systems. Pipes may freeze in temperat e as well as frigid zones.In frigid climates, freezing presents a major problem to a water distribution system, and pipesAFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200883are normally insulated and he ated. If a building’s temperature falls below freezing, insidepipes may also freeze causing the pipe to break at the weakest point. The best way to avoid fro-zen pipes is to insulate or wrap lines with electrical heat tape. In areas where the ground is per-manently frozen, water pipes are placed in h eated conduits. Pipes are typically buried belowfrost penetration depth in temperate climates where freezing is only a seasonal problem. Evenwith proper protection, some pipes may still  freeze. The paragraphs below discuss somepipe-thawing procedures. 4.3.2.3.7.1.  Electrical Thawing of Wrought-Iron and Cast-Iron Pipe. Electrical thaw-ing is quick and relatively inexpensive. Th e electrical circuit fo r the thawing operationconsists of a sourc e of current (a DC genera tor, such as a welding  unit, or a transformerconnected to an AC outlet), a length of the frozen pipe, and two insulated wires connectingthe current source and the pipe. As current fl ows through the pipe, heat is generated andthe ice within the pipe begins to melt. As the water starts to flow, the rest of the ice is pro-gressively melted by contact with the flowin g water. The wires f rom the current sourcemay be connected to nearby hydrants, valves, or  exposed points at the ends of the frozensection. The amount of current and voltage required to thaw various sizes of wrought-ironand cast-iron pipe are given in  Table 4.3. The time required for el ectrical thawing variesfrom 5 minutes to over 2 hour s, depending on the  pipe size and leng th, the intensity offreezing, and several ot her factors. The best  practice is to supply current until the waterflows freely. Table 4.3.  Current and Voltage Required to Thaw Wrought-Iron and Cast-Iron Pipes. Type Pipe Size Pipe Length Approx. Volts Approx. Amps Wrought Iron Cast Iron Inches 3/4 1 1-1/2 2 3 4 6 8 (mm) (20) (25) (40) (50) (75) (100) (150) (200) Feet 600 600 600 500 400 400 400 300 (m) (180) (180) (180) (150) (120) (120) (120) (90) 60 60 60 55 50 50 50 40 250 300 350 400 450 500 600 600 4.3.2.3.7.1.1.  Precautions. In general, do not use a curr ent higher than the one listedin Table 4.3. for a particular pipe size. When in doubt, use a lower current for a longerperiod of time. Select contact points on the pipe as close as possible to the frozen sec-tion and make sure the contact  points are free of rust, grea se, or scale. Remove anymeters, electrical ground connections, and couplings to the building plumbing from theline to be thawed. If the pi pe joints have gaskets or ot her insulation, thaw the pipe insections between the joints or use copper jumpers to pass the current around the insu-lated joints. 84AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 20084.3.2.3.7.1.2.  Procedures. To thaw pipe with a weld ing generator or similar DCsource, set the generator to the correct amperage for the pipe to be thawed and connectleads to the pipe. For an AC  source, transformers are required to adjust the amperageof the AC circuit to the pipe being thawe d. Consult an electrical engineer for the besttransformer arrangement. To keep hazards to a minimum, a competent electrician gen-erally sets and connects tr ansformers, makes the connec tions, and assists throughoutthe thawing procedure. Wher e frequent thawing is necessary at di fferent points, thetransformers may be mounted on a trailer for ready use. 4.3.2.3.7.2.  Steam Thawing. Steam thawing is slower than electrical thawing and is usedonly when insulating ma terial in pipe joints or couplings makes the use of electricityimpractical. In steam thawing,  a hose connected to  a boiler is inserted through a discon-nected fitting and gradually ad vanced as the steam melts th e ice. Steam thawing is com-monly used on fire hydrants. 4.3.2.3.7.3.  Thawing With a Heat Lamp or Blow Torch. A heat lamp or blowtorch is agood method for th awing aboveground pipes, but there is a risk  of fire—especially withplastic pipes. Use the followi ng steps to thaw frozen pipe s when using a  heat lamp orblowtorch: (1) open the faucets in the line; (2) apply heat from the heat lamp or blowtorchat one end of the pipe and work along the entire length of the pipe (Figure 4.10.); (3) con-tinue to heat the pipe unt il the water flows freely. Caution: Do not overheat the pipes,because soldered joints will break loose if the solder melts. Figure 4.10.  Thawing Frozen Interior Pipes. 4.3.2.3.7.4.  Thawing with  Boiling Water and Thaw Pi pe. Follow the steps in  Table 4.4.and use the illustration in Figure 4.11. to thaw frozen exterior pipes. 4.3.2.3.7.5.  Other Thawing Methods. Pipes can  also be thawed by wrapping them withburlap or other cloth and pouring boiling water over the wrappings, thus transmitting heatto the frozen pipe. In some cases, a small pump may be used to clear a piece of pipe. How-ever, excessive pump pressure can cause a backup; therefore, this procedure must be care-fully monitored. When indoor pi pes freeze due to failure in the heating plant, the heatingplant must be repaired. A high  temperature should be maintained in the building until thepipes thaw. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008854.3.2.3.8.  Disinfecting the Piping System. After repairs are made to water supply pipes, cleanand disinfect plumbing pipes and other parts of a water supply system carrying drinking waterbefore use. Flush the system to remove dirt, waste, and surface water. Disinfect each unit witha chemical such as a solution of hypochlorite or chlorine according to established disinfectionstandards and procedures. Normally, there is little danger of contamination, and disinfection isnot required if leaks or breaks are repaired with clamping devices while the mains remain fullof pressurized water. Table 4.4.  Steps to Thaw Frozen Underground Pipes. Pipe Thawing Procedures Remove the pipe fittings. Insert small thaw pipe or tube into the frozen pipe as shown in Figure 4.11. Step 1 Step 2 Step 3  Add an elbow and a piece of vertical pipe to outer end of the thaw pipe. Step 4 Step 5 Step 6 Place a bucket under the opening to the frozen pipe. Insert a funnel into the open end of the vertical pipe. Pour boiling water into the funnel and, as the ice melts, push the thaw pipe forward. Step 7  After the flow starts, withdraw the pipe quickly.  Allow the flow to continue until the thaw pipe is completely withdrawn and cleared of ice. Figure 4.11.  Thawing Frozen Exterior Pipes. 4.4.  Water Treatment Systems. The expedient restoration of water trea tment capabilities may consist ofrepairs to an existing treatment plant or the installation of portable water treatment units. The importanceof restoring the water treatment facility will depend upon the quality of the in stallation water source fol-lowing an emergency. If the source is relatively free of contaminants, treatment plant repairs or setting upof portable treatment equipment may be of less importance than othe r installation repairs. If water treat-86AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008ment is necessary and the treatment plant is beyond repair, or the installation does not possess a treatmentfacility, it may be necess ary to use expedi ent water treatment equipment. Th e most common expedientwater treatment system available to civil e ngineer forces is the rever se osmosis water purification unit(ROWPU). The ROWPU purifies wate r by forcing water under high pre ssure through a series of mem-branes to eliminate impurities. The ROWPU is capable of removing dissolved minerals from water. Dis-infection treatment is accomplished  only after processing  through the membrane fi lter elements sincechlorine causes acute damage to  the filter elements. The producti on capability of  the ROWPU will bereduced by high temperatures of the feedwater source. Although ROWPUs come in several sizes, the AirForce currently uses both the 600-GPH unit shown in Figure 4.12. and the 1500-GPH unit shown in Fig-ure 4.13. For more information on ROWPU operations, refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 9, Guide to ReverseOsmosis Water Purification Unit Installation and Operation. Figure 4.12.  600-GPH Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU). Figure 4.13.  1500-GPH Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU). 4.5.  Water Storage Systems. The water storage system on an air base or beddown location may consist ofunderground reservoirs, elevated water tanks, open reservoirs, and temporary storage facilities like thosein Figure 4.14. The most severe damage to the storage system could be a rupture causing loss of thestored water. Another consideration is sabotage by clandestine groups. Whenever possible, water storagefacilities should be postured well within the secure  area of the installation  or beddown setting. Rupturesor other damage to existing storage facilities can be sealed from the inside using rubber patches, epoxy, orwooden dowels if the holes are small. When conventional installation water storage facilities are damagedor additional storage space  is required, swimming pools  and similar watertight  facilities make excellentAFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200887alternate reservoirs. Other expedient water storage alternatives include: flexible bladders ranging in sizeup to a 50,000-gallon capacity, water distribution trucks, water trailers, lyster bags, 5- and 10-gallon igloowater coolers, and 55-gallon drum s. An aboveground reservoir can  be constructed using sandba gs orearthen berms lined with plastic sheeting to make it watertight. Bear in mind that a considerable amountof water is stored within the pipelines themselves. For example, a 6-inch pipeline, two miles long containsapproximately 16,000 gallons  when full. Using shutoff valves to  quickly isolate undamaged sections ofthe distribution system could mean substantial amounts of water saved within the pipes for future use. Figure 4.14.  Temporary Water Storage Facilities. 4.6.  Expedient Water Sources. The source of water for an air base or beddown location may be as var-ied as a commercial supplier, a ground water source, or a surface water source (Figure 4.15.). Damage toa commercial water supply during an emergency will normally consist of a ruptur ed or blocked supplyline that results in either reduc ing or eliminating the base water  supply. Ground water sources, waterpumped from below the surface, are probably the least vulnerable supply sources. It can be assumed mostnatural disasters or hostile attacks would not destroy this type of water source. However, some emergen-cies can cause damage to the well and pumping systems that give access to this source. Specifically, wellscould be partially filled with debris, well walls and pumping facilities damaged or destroyed entirely. Var-ious types of emergency situations can af fect surface water sources a lso. Water-borne debris associatedwith a flood or hurricane might block water inlets to the system; nuclear, biological, or chemical contam-inants used during an en emy attack could make the source unus able; or conventional enemy munitionsmay diminish, divert, or stop access to a river or lake. Other  sources of water available to the civil engi-neer force are sometim es overlooked. In cold weather regi ons there are vast amounts of "solid" wateravailable in the form of snow and ice. Snow and ice melting devices can be fabricated and used to provideexcellent water supplies from glaciers and other ice formations. Base swimming pools, ornamental pools,and similar facilities often contain substantial amounts of water, which can be used during emergencies.Table 4.5. through Table 4.8. show the characteristic advantages and disadvantages associated with sup-plying and using water in the four major climatic regions of the world. 88AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 4.15.  Sourcing Water for Earthquake Victims (Turkey 1999). Table 4.5.  Temperate Regions. Advantages Abundant Resources Lakes Streams Rivers Existing Wells Local Water Systems Sources are convenient to locate, develop, and access. Water sources can be purified at small unit level. Drinking water does not require cooling. Disadvantages Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear munitions easily contaminate surface sources. Natural contamination is possible by organic, disease-bearing organisms, and inorganic salt. Environmental pollution from local development such as septic fields may contaminate ground water. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Table 4.6.  Tropical Regions. 89Advantages Disadvantages Water sources available are more scattered than temperate regions.  They include: Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear munitions easily contaminate surface sources. Lakes Streams Rivers Existing Wells Local Water Systems Water sources can be purified at small unit level. Dense vegetation may make access difficult. The presence of waterborne diseases and parasites capable of transmitting disease may make water unsuitable for bathing and laundry use until disinfected. Higher water use is needed because of high humidity and heat. Table 4.7.  Frigid Regions. Advantages Disadvantages Water sources may be abundant, but frozen.  Sources include: Expect increased consumption to prevent dehydration. Lakes Streams Rivers Existing Wells Water purification, storage, and distribution systems must be protected against freezing. Snow and ice are impractical to melt for other than very small units due to the excessive fuel needed for melting. 90Table 4.8.  Desert Regions. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Advantages Disadvantages None.  Surface fresh water almost nonexistent. Available water sources are limited and widely dispersed. Anticipate increased water use to prevent heat casualties. Limited supplies may dictate the tactical scenario. The lack of water abundance makes an extensive storage and distribution system vital. 4.6.1.  Water Sources Development. Once water sources have been  identified for a beddown loca-tion, the field engineer  must further develop and  maintain these sources  for use. General tasksinvolved in this process include, (1) developing  water points by creati ng ponds and lakes acrossstreams, deepening and reinforcing existing water collection areas; (2) providing drainage to preventcontamination of water sources from storm runoff; (3) constructing physical protection structures forwater sources; (4) constructing and improving roads from water points and well sites to the main sup-ply routes; (5) maintainin g, repairing and buildin g semi-permanent and pe rmanent water utilities atexisting installations; and (6) repairing and constructing water storage and distribution systems. 4.6.2.  Surface Water Resources. Surface water from ri vers, streams, lakes, or spri ngs is the mostcommon sources of water supply . Surface water sources must be tr eated according to establishedwater treatment procedures and standards to ensure water is potable before use. Refer to AFH 10-222,Volume 9 for water treatment procedures. The capacity of small streams to meet supply requirementsmay be increased by the construction of small dams  or reservoirs. Expedient structures for this pur-pose are shown in Figure 4.16. through Figure 4.18. In regions such as tropical islands where there isabundant rainfall and rapid surface runof f, rainwater is the primary source for the inhabitants, how-ever, the quantity of water available may not be sufficient to supply the needs of both the civilian pop-ulation and the military. Rainwater as a source may be sufficient for small units for limited operations,but it should not be considered if other more reliable sources are available. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200891Figure 4.16.  Expedient Dam and Reservoir Layout. Figure 4.17.  Typical Small Expedient Dam. 92AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 4.18.  Improvised Dam for Impounding a Small Stream. 4.6.3.  Water Intakes. Once the natural water resources are confined in a reservoir the water must bedelivered to the point of usage. This is generally accomplished by pumps or gravity pipelines. Intakesare used as a means of obtaining water from its source. Water at the intake point should be as clear anddeep as possible. Screens are installed on all in takes regardless of how  clean the water appears.Screens used at surface sources serve to keep fish and debris out of the water system. Special attentionmust be given to the intake. If a lot of muck or silt is on the bottom of the water source, a floating typeintake is best. On the other hand,  if bottom of the water source is  a bed of sand or gravel, a surfaceintake with a screen may be equally effective and easier to use. 4.6.3.1.  Floatable Intakes. Floats made of logs, lumber, sealed cans, or empty fuel drums can beused to support the intake strainer in deep water. They are especially useful in large streams wherethe quality of the water  varies across its width or  where the water is not  deep enough near thebanks to cover the intake  strainer. An adequate depth of  water can cover t he intake point byanchoring or stationing the float at the deep part of the stream. The intake hose should be securedto the top of the float, allowi ng enough slack for movement of the  float. If support lines are usedto secure the float to the banks, the position of the float can be altered to correspond to changes indepth by manipulation of the lines. The chief advantage of a float intake is the ease with which thescreen can be adj usted. Figure 4.19. and Figure 4.20. illustrate two type s of improvised intakefloats. Note: The strainer on the suction hose of a floating intake should be placed at least 4 inchesbelow the water level. This precaution reduces  the possibility of the strainer becoming cloggedwith floating debris, or the loss of prime owing to air entering the suction line. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 200893Figure 4.19.  Drum Float Type Water Intake. Figure 4.20.  Log Float Type Water Intake. 4.6.3.2.  Rock and S take Supported Intakes: If  the stream is not too sw ift and the water is deepenough, an expedient intake  may be prepared by placing the intake  strainer on a rock. This willprevent clogging of the strainer  by the streambed and  provide enough water overhead to preventthe suction of air  into the intake  pipe. If the water source is a sm all stream or shallow lake theintake pipe can be secured to a post or pile as shown in Figure 4.21. 94AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 4.21.  Stake Supported Water Intake. 4.6.3.3.  Pit Supported Intakes. When a stream is so shallow that the intake screen is not coveredby at least 4 inches of water , a pit should be dug  and the screen laid on a rock or board placed atthe bottom of the pit. Pits dug in  streams with clay or  silt bottoms should be  lined with gravel toprevent dirt from entering the purification equipment (Figure 4.22.). The screen is surrounded bygravel that prevents collapse of the sides of th e pit and shields the screen from damage by lar gefloating objects. The gravel also acts as a coarse strainer for the water. Enclosing the intake screenin a bucket or other container as shown in Figure 4.23. may provide a similar method. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 4.22.  Typical Gravel Pit Intake. 95Figure 4.23.  Bucket Use with Gravel Pit Intake. 4.7.  Wastewater (Sewage) Systems. Improper disposal of sewage in  the aftermath of a disaster orenemy attack will compound base recovery problems. If the sewage enters a water supply, an outbreak ofintestinal diseases such as typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and diarrhea, is almost certain to occur. To preventsuch outbreaks, civil engineer forces may have to repair damage to existing sewer systems as well as pro-vide temporary sanitation facilities. The priority of these repairs will be based on an estimate of potentialhazard to the installation population. 4.7.1.  Classification of Air Base Sewage. Sewage may be divided into several classifications accord-ing to its source. These classifica tions will decide the imm ediate need for sewe r rehabilitation. Thetwo primary types of sewage on most installations are domestic sewage and storm sewage. 96AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 20084.7.1.1.  Domestic Sewage . Domestic sewage is the waste from  toilets, lavatories, urinals, bath-tubs, showers, laundries, and kitchens. Proper disposal of this type of sewage should receive firstconsideration in expedient repair operations. 4.7.1.2.  Storm Sewage. Storm sewage is the inflow of surface runoff during or immediately fol-lowing a storm or heavy rain. Disposal of storm sewage following a disaster is not a high priorityunless it hinders base operations or endangers lives by flooding critical areas. Since storm sewersare designed to catch runof f whether it is natural or man-made, th ey will also ca tch and collecttoxic chemicals introduced accidentally or on purpose. For this  reason, civil engineers should beprepared to establish blocking points at critical locations to prevent the spread of hazardous mate-rials. Storm sewers may be blocked using commercially available plugs or sandbags. 4.7.2.  Sewage System Operation. The major components of the sewage system consist of facilities forcollecting, pumping, treating, and disposing of sewa ge. The basic collecting  system consists of aseries of branch, lateral, main, and trunk sewers leading from various installation structures. Raw sew-age moves through the collection system to a central point for treatment and eventual disposal. At anypoint along the system where gravity is not sufficient to move the sewage, a pump or lift station maybe required. Sewage treatment plants vary in complexity according to the characteristics of the influ-ent and the degree of treatment requ ired prior to discha rge. Effluent standards, set by national andlocal regulations, determine the degree of treatment. 4.7.3.  Anticipated Sewer Damage.  Common problems with the sewage  system during typical disas-ters such as floods and hurricane s are complete inundation of th e system by excessive amounts ofwater and blockage of parts of the system by debris. In the extreme, earthquakes or enemy attacks cancause complete destruction of treatm ent plants and lift stat ions as well as rupt ures of sewage lines.Damage sustained during hostile attacks will probably be collateral in nature since the sewage systemis not normally a preplanned target. Specific damage could consist of the following: 4.7.3.1.  Sewers. Deliberate demolition to sewers by an enemy is usually limited to junction man-holes or large mains. Stoppages caused by debris  being blown and washed into sewers can beexpected. 4.7.3.2.  Pumping S tations. During conflict, pum ping stations may be deliberately damagedbecause they are key points, are  more accessible, and are most dif ficult to repair. They are notlikely to be damaged seriously by bombs or artillery fire since they offer a relatively small target.However, flooding during either tropical storms or tornados can prove consequential. 4.7.3.3.  Treatment Units. Treatment units may be damaged during a conflict by the demolition ofmachinery and other key equipment. However, they are not norma lly high-value targets due totheir small size and the ability to achieve effective treatment results by other means. 4.7.3.4.  Cesspools and Sep tic Tanks. Damage to cesspools an d septic tanks from sabotage orbombing is relatively unimportant. Destruction of a cesspool or septic tank would affect only oneor a small number of properties. Their wide dispersal provides a large measure of safety. 4.7.4.  Effect of Damage. Human wastes must be properly disposed of in order to protect personnel. Ifsewage enters a water supply , an epidemic outbreak of intestinal  diseases such as typhoid, cholera,dysentery, and diarrhea is almost certain to follow . Existing sewer systems ma y have to be rehabili-tated to prevent such mission-impacting outbreaks. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008974.7.5.  Expedient Re pair Procedures. Expedient sewer repairs should consist only of the minimumwork required to prevent the outbrea k of disease. For example, i f the ruptured sewer line results insewage leakage into an occupied area and does not threaten water sources, repairs can be delayed untilemergency conditions subside. When damage is too widespread for  expedient repair, civil engineersmust resort to pro ven field sanitation methods. Development of  temporary latrine facilities isaddressed in Chapter 6 of this pamphlet. The rehabilitation of a sewage disposal system requires thefollowing actions. 4.7.5.1.  Sewers. Sewer lines are the most essential item in a sewage disposal system. If the situa-tion is critical, service can be restored temporarily by pumping from an upstream manhole, aroundthe damaged section, and into a downstream manhole. If the sewer is completely stopped or badlydamaged, an open channel can be  built. Where storm and sanitary  sewers are separate, it may bepossible to divert sanitary sewage through a storm sewer to a suitable outlet. 4.7.5.2.  Pumping Stations. When sewage pumping stations cannot be repaired expeditiously usingavailable replacement parts or  parts cannibalized from other st ations, portable pumps should besubstituted. If pumps are not availabl e, consider rerouting past the  lift station with pipe or openchannels using gravity flow. 4.7.5.3.  Treatment Plants. It may be necessary to bypass severely damaged treatment plants. Set-tling and digestion tanks and filters can usually be repair ed with standard construction materials.Sludge beds are practically indestructible. M achinery must be repair ed by cannibalization orimprovised methods. If compressed  air is used in an activated sl udge process, replacement of aircompressors is difficult at best. However, the activated sludge plants can be operated as sedimen-tation or septic tanks. Such treatment, together with chlorination, provides a reasonable degree ofpurification. Further information about expedient septic systems is provided in Chapter 6 of thispamphlet. 4.7.5.4.  Septic Tanks. Septic tank systems (Figure 4.24.) are used to treat and dispose of waste-water from buildings wher e it is not feasible to provide a  community wastewater collection andtreatment system. A septic tank speeds up the decay of raw sewa ge. It may be made of concrete,stone, fiberglass, or brick (lumber is used when other materi als are not available), in box-sectionform, and it should be watertight. The septic tank should have a manhole and cover to give accessfor cleaning and repair and must be designed to hold 70 percent of the peak water demand of thatfacility for 24 hours and not less th an 16 hours. Contingency rapid re pair of a septic tank wouldnormally be low prio rity since other options ar e usually available. However, if a septic tank isseverely damaged and totally inoperable and othe r prudent options are not available, an expedi-ent-type septic tank can be constructed using procedures provided in Chapter 6 of this pamphlet.Otherwise, expedient repairs would probably be limited to unc logging pipes, pumping out tanks,and improving or expanding drain fields. 98AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 4.24.  Typical Septic Tank. 4.7.5.5.  Grease Traps. Grease traps come in countless sh apes and sizes, but their operation isbasically the same. Just as the  name suggests, a grease trap catc hes grease (animal fats and oils)from kitchen wastewater. Although there are ma ny different models, grease traps are typicallyplaced in the flow line  of the building’s sewer system to ca tch grease and fats from kitchen andscullery sinks, preventing clogs in the waste pipes. Expedient repair of grease traps is usually lim-ited to unclogging inlet pipes and repairing or replacing damaged traps. Service personnel shouldbe trained to perform routine cl eaning and maintenance of grease traps installed in their area(s) .Figure 4.25. provides a layout of a typical grease trap. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 4.25.  Typical Grease Trap Layout. 994.7.5.6.  Additional details on  water supply and wastewater sy stems repair procedures can beobtained in the following documents: 4.7.5.6.1.

Natural Gas Systems. Damage to a natural gas system must  be dealt with rapi dly to prevent andcontain potential accidents like the one shown in Figure 4.26. The most expedient method of dealing withgas system leaks is to shut  off the gas supply at main feeder po ints. Since gas is often not essential toinstallation operations, selective system isolation can usually be used  until time and resources are avail-able to make the necessary permanent repairs. 100AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 4.26.  Ruptured Natural Gas Line Fire. 4.8.1.  Emergency Cut-Off Procedures. If it is not possible to shut the gas off through the use of exist-ing valves, gas main bags or gas stoppers, as shown in Figure 4.27., may be required. Gas main bagsare canvas or rubber bags which can be inserted into a gas main and inflated until they fill the pipe andhalt the gas flow. The gas stopper  consists of oiled or rubber -coated canvas stretched over a flexiblesteel frame. The edge of the stopper forms a seal with the interior of the gas main thereby stopping thegas flow. To seal a main with a gas bag, the rubber or canvas bag is inserted through a hole in the main(a hole created by damage, removal of a riser, or access port). If the interior of the pipe is coated withtar or oil, canvas bags are necessary. The bag is then inflated through a piece of attached tubing untilit fills the pipe and stops the gas flow. To use a gas stopper, the frame is squeezed together and insertedinto the hole in the gas main. After the stopper is in the pipe, it is restored to its circular shape throughthe use of wire levers attached to the frame. The ga s stopper can then be adjusted to shut of f the gasflow. In larger mains, it is safer to use both bag and stopper. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 4.27.  Typical Gas Main Bag Kit. 1014.8.2.  Expedient Repairs of Gas Systems. As mentioned earlier, it is best to simply cut off gas systemsand make permanent repairs later when the emergency has subsided. However, certain conditions maycall for some immediate expedient repairs to prevent danger to personnel or to provide limited gas ser-vice. 4.8.2.1.  Venting of Gas Accumulations. After the main gas supply is shut off, immediately checkbuildings and other areas for th e presence of dangerous gas accu mulations. The presence of gascan be detected through the use of special gas detection devices such as a combustible gas indica-tor or, when no detection instrument is availabl e, by an individual’s sense of smell. The sense ofsmell cannot always be depended on to detect leaks because ga s can lose its odor while travelingthrough the ground. Any accumulations should be vented to the outside to reduce the potential forasphyxiation or explosion. 4.8.2.2.  Repair of Broken or Punc tured Gas Pipes. There may be  conditions following an emer-gency when gas must be supplied  to certain facilities for esse ntial operations. For example, thedining hall may have no alternate method of preparing food for the recovery force, or the hospitalmay need hot water for crucial medical services and have no other source of energy for water heat-ers. During periods of cold weather, gas may be the only source of heat for certain mission-criticalinstallation facilities. Under any of these conditions, leaking or ruptured gas  lines may requirepatching. If the leak is small a nd involves low-pressure gas pipes,  a sealant may be used in con-junction with a pressure mold to close the  opening. The sealant should be a product which doesnot break down in the presence of natural gas. Larger leaks and pipe breaks can be repaired usingvarious types of mechanical clamps. 4.8.2.3.  Safety. The potential for asphyxiation or explosion during encounters with gas leaksmakes it imperative that the repair crew exercise extreme caution. Personnel should not enter con-fined areas with high gas accumu lations unless they are equipped  with self-contained breathingapparatus. No open flame from cutting torches, ci garette lighters, or similar devices will be usedin a gaseous environment. Additionally, the repair crew must be careful not to generate sparks inthe vicinity of a gas leak. A good  rule of thumb is not to enter  any area where the mixture of airand gas is at, or  approaches, the lower explosive limits. Taking a few  extra minutes to properlyvent the area will greatly reduce the danger to personnel. 102AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 20084.8.2.4.  Leak Detection Measures. Natural gas can  be detected through the use of special gasdetection devices such as the ones shown in  Figure 4.28. There are also other methods to detectgas leaks—like heavy insect activity (swarming), hissing sound, unusual improvement or deterio-ration in surrounding vegetation, and odor. Although natural gas is odorless, gas companies injectodor additives into the system to warn the public and  aid in leak identification. These additivesproduce a rotten egg or sulfur odor when released into the air . However, be aware that a lack ofodor is not a reliable indicator of  the absence of a gas leak. The  odor of the gas could be filteredout as the gas passes through cert ain soils or the odor may be m odified by other vapors within asewer system. Therefore, reports of gas leaks should be investigated using leak detection devicessuch as a Combustible Gas Indicator (CGI) or Flame Ionization Detector (FI). An effective way topinpoint the location of small leaks on exposed lines involves using a spray bottle of soapy water.The soapy liquid will bubble when it comes in contact with a leak. Figure 4.28.  Common Gas Leak Detection Devices. 4.9.  POL Systems. An installation’s petroleum, oils and lubricants (POL) system is a key utility that hastwo primary components: storage facilities and distribution systems. 4.9.1.  Storage Facilities. Most installations have several days of storage capacity for major fuel prod-ucts. POL storage methods vary  considerably from installation to  installation. At some CONUSinstallations, there are large fixed storage tanks located aboveground (Figure 4.29.). Conversely, POLstorage tanks at most overseas locations are both dispersed and covere d by a protective layer of soil.In both instances, engineer forces  will only be able to  accomplish expedient  repairs if the involveddamage is superficial. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 4.29.  Altus AFB POL Tank Farm. 1034.9.2.  Distribution System. The  POL distribution consists of pum ping stations, pipelines, and dis-pensing points. The nature  of construction of the POL distribu tion system makes it  relatively safefrom natural disasters othe r than flooding. The ma jor damage that a POL  distribution system mightreceive would more likely result from an enemy attack during wartime. The impact of damage will bereduced at installations where the distribution system is interconnected. As a protective measure, mostcontrol valves at a number of overseas locations have been installed in pits in order to limit their expo-sure to direct impact during an attack. 4.9.2.1.  Pumping Stations. POL pumping stations are not easy targets to hit, however, and wouldnot be considered primary tar gets during an en emy attack. Some loss es to pumping capabilityshould be expected from collateral damage but it is likely that some capacity to pump fuel will beretained. 4.9.2.2.  Pipelines. POL pipe lines are essentially al l welded steel. They  are the most survivablePOL system component. However, since the distribution system piping is the most extensive ele-ment of the POL system, it is the most likely element to be damaged. The impact of such damagewill be reduced at installations where the distribution system is looped. 4.9.2.3.  Dispensing Points. Dispensing points range fr om vehicle fill stands to concrete-encasedaircraft hydrant refueling systems. The fill stands service POL tank trucks for refueling aircraft atmost locations. Damage to fill stands can be expected as a collateral effect of weapons detonation.Hydrant refueling systems, however, because of their "hardness," should remain relatively intact. 4.9.3.  POL Repair Actions. Damage  to the POL system is compounded  by the volatile nature of thesystem contents. Engineers will have to think in terms of expedien t repairs to water systems and usewhatever spare parts and materials  currently exist in bench stock or  special levels. However, unlikewater systems, POL repair crews will have to be especially concerned with toxicity, flammability, andcompatibility issues. Primarily for Pacific theater  installations, the POL rapid utility repair kit104AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008(RURK) provides a means of quickly  repairing valve and line failur es resulting from an attack ordisaster. For additional information on the POL Utility Repair Kit or the Contingency Fuel RecoverySystem, refer to the associated Qualification Training Package (Figure 4.30.). Figure 4.30.  POL Qualification Training Packages. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008105Chapter 5  EXPEDIENT REPAIR OF HVAC AND ELECTRIC SYSTEMS 5.1.  Introduction. Air bases need viable power source to support mission operations. Electrical power isessential to daily activities; and, to a lesser de gree, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)systems are also necessary. Obviously, having effective heating and air conditioning for personal comforthas a minimum impact  on aircraft sortie generation. However, in today’s operating environment, a largenumber of mission-critical systems and electronic equipment require stringent climate control. For exam-ple, many command and control cente rs are self-contained operations that cannot function without inde-pendent electrical or HVAC support. In these situations, adequate  HVAC systems are critical to missionaccomplishment. 5.2.  Overview. This chapter focuses on expedient HVAC and electrical repair options during contin-gency situations. Specific topics include recovery concepts and expedient repair of heating, air condition-ing, and electrical distribution systems. Each of  these areas deals with ha zardous materials and mayrequire work on or near energized circuits; therefore, only trained technicians are allowed to accomplishHVAC and electrical system repairs and modifications, while strictly complying with Air Force electricalsafety criteria. Electrical safety requirements in AFI 32-1064 , Electrical Safe Practices, and UFC3-560-01, Electrical Safety O&M, are mandatory and outline the type  of arc thermal performance value(ATVP) rated PPE to wear when wo rking on or near energized circuits, when work on or near ener gizedcircuits is authorized, and who is the energized work authority. Table 4-2 in UFC 3-560-0 defines hazard./risk category classifications for work tasks. In addition, due to the complexity of these systems, the scopeof this document is to pr ovide only basic expe dient repair guidelines for  use during emergencies. Addi-tional information is provided in the references listed in Attachment 1. 5.3.  Heating Systems. In general, heating systems carry heat from the point of production to the place ofuse, and their design can be complex with many  variations. They are usuall y classified by the mediumused to carry the heat from the source to the point of use, such as hot water, steam, and forced-air systems. 5.3.1.  Heating Systems Repair. Depending upon weather c onditions at the time  of a disaster orattack, repairing damage to the heating system can range in importance from critical to insignificant.The extent of damage can span the gamut from  nothing whatsoever to  total destruction. However,unless the installation is undergoing a period of severe cold, repairs to  heating systems servicingnon-mission-essential facilities can probably be delayed throug h the use of spa ce heaters and thewearing of additional clothing. Ho wever, if repairs must be made , concentrate on  minimum effortsnecessary to return some measure of  heat to base facilitie s. It is not necessary  to attain pre-disastercomfort levels following an emergency. A partial return of heat can  raise temperatures to a level thatwill allow normal operations if personnel are warmly clothed. 5.3.1.1.  Central Heating Systems Repair. For those installations that have a lar ge central heat-ing system, damage following an attack or disaster can be widespread. It may well involve the pro-duction plant along with the distribution system. The feasibility of conducting expedient repairs tothe heating system will depend to a great degree upon the amount of damage incurred. For exam-ple, if an earthquake or  bomb explosion causes a la rge rupture of the central  boiler, it is unlikelythat expedient repair techniques will suffice. On the other hand, a break in one of the pipes leadingfrom the boiler could probably be expediently repaired. Fortunately, the inherent strength of mate-106AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008rials used to contain the pressure within the system also serves to protect the system from externaldamage. Expedient repairs to central heating systems may consist of the following: 5.3.1.1.1.  Production Plant Repairs. Expedient repair of heat production plants may bedelayed pending structural and/or electrical support. Damaged walls may have to be shored toprevent structural collapse or electrical utility service may have to be restored to power controland monitoring devices. From a mechanical perspective, broken pipes may need to be repairedor replaced, damaged automatic  controls may have to be bypassed with manual ones, andinternal cannibalization may be require d in order to get some boilers  back in operation. Asstated earlier, however, if a plant’s boilers have sustained significant damage, the productionplant is probably beyond immediate repair. 5.3.1.1.2.  Distribution System Repairs. The high heat and pressure associated with mostheating systems are characteristics that preclude the use of many expedient repair methods andmaterials used to otherwise correct water distribution system damage. For example, temporaryconnectors, such as fire hoses, which are ef fective in bridging damage to a water distributionsystem, will likely not tolerate the high temperatures and pressures of a heat distribution line.Similarly, a standard sealer or joint compound which could patch a water leak will break downwhen applied to a steam line. If repairs are attempted, only materials which have been specifi-cally designed to withstand th e stresses imposed by  heating systems s hould be used. Pipereplacement and welding are the most common re pair techniques used to correct distributionsystem problems. Caution must be exercised, however, since welding of high-pressure vesselsis a specialized technique and requires substa ntial experience. You cannot slap together asteam line, even in a contingency mode, and e xpect it to work. In overseas areas, expect toencounter older systems which  may contain components that  are no longer in production.Repair parts for these facilities may have to be  custom fabricated or  cannibalized from othersystems. Most locations, however, should have an emergency stock of heating system materi-als. Tap this source as much as possible. 5.3.1.2.  Individual Systems Repair. Installations without a central heating system generally fea-ture individual building systems. The great advantages of these independent units are that damageis limited to the system which  supports a single building and genera l repair concepts are, for themost part, universally applicable. The basic question then becomes whether or not to repair. 5.3.1.2.1.  The easiest way to deal with a damaged individual heating system is to ignore it. Ifthe weather permits, or the facility is not critical to the base mission, delay repairs until emer-gency conditions are essentially  over. Another quick alternativ e when extensive repairs arerequired is to move personnel into a nearby building with a working heating system. 5.3.1.2.2.  Expedient repairs to an individu al heating unit are gene rally less complex thanrepairs on a large central system. Damage is confined and easy to determine since the indepen-dent system does not involve a dispersed ne twork. Components are sma ller, making it easierfor repair crew members to install replacements. Also, spare parts may be more readily avail-able from base supply and local vendors. Furt hermore, since there often are many facilitiescontaining similar individual heating systems, there are more opportunities for cannibalizationof parts from low- priority buildings. If the damage is limited to the system’s ducting, tempo-rary flexible ducts can be rapidly put in place to correct the problem. Figure 5.1. shows exam-ples of flexible ducting. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008107Figure 5.1.  Typical Flexible HVAC Ducting. 5.3.2.  Alternative Heating Source s. If attempts to re pair existing installation heating systems fail,temporary heating sources can be provided for mission-essential facilities. Remember, however, alter-nate heat sources can be  dangerous and require fre quent checks and servicing. As time permits, sys-tems should be repaired  by using existing stocks  or cannibalized materials, thereby freeing theportable heaters for use elsewhere. 5.3.2.1.  Space Heaters. Various types of space heaters provide  an alternative to central or indi-vidual heating systems. Fuel-fired heaters (Figure 5.2.) can be used in large open buildings if theodor is not objectionable and explosive vapors are not present. The propane heater on the right ofthe figure delivers 8,000 to 24,000 BTUs of portable, infrared heat from a common 20-lb propanecylinder. A number of variations  are readily available o n the open market, including larger unitsdesigned to meet higher heating demands.  Table 5.1. provides approximate propane fuel con-sumption information for various  temperatures. In general, open  flame heaters are dangerous,especially the unvented type. If they are used th e catalytic types are the  safest. Electric heaters(Figure 5.3.) provide a safe alternative to open flame units provided temporary wiring and powersources can handle the extra load. Space heaters can be obtained from various sources. BEARassets contain units ( Figure 5.4.) that can be used in permanent  structures or tents. Commercialspace heaters may be available from local vendors. Some installation units may also have portableshop heaters which can be reassigned to more critical facilities. 108AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 5.2.

Typical Industrial Portable Electric Heater. Figure 5.4.  BEAR Heater Asset. 5.3.2.2.  Cart-Type Ducted Heaters. Cart-type ducted heaters provide an excellent alternate heatsource because combustion stays outside the structure being heated . The units may be ava ilablefrom organizations on base, such as aerospace ground equi pment (AGE) or communicationssquadrons, after requirements for aircraft sorties and other vital operations have been met. 5.3.2.3.  Improvised Heaters. The use of improvised heaters should be avoided except in cases ofextreme cold and where no other alternative exists. The primary dangers inherent with improvisedheating systems are the possibility for asphyxiation and fire hazard potential. Caution must be110AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008taken to ensure that dangerous  fumes are vented during combus tion and any open flame is prop-erly contained. One of the most common types of improvised heaters consists of a 55-gallon drumconverted for use as a burner coupled with makeshift sheet metal ducting to vent fumes to the out-side. Remember, improvised heaters do not completely contain combustion vapors. Therefore,even with vents to the outside, makeshift heaters should never be used in totally enclosed areas. 5.4.  Air Conditioning Systems. Most, if not all, installations have some facilities that ca nnot functionproperly without air conditioning a nd/or climate control support. T oday’s Air Force relies on sophisti-cated electronics that supp ort the operation and maintenance of such  things as aircraft navigation andattack systems, computer systems, communications, and air traffic control equipment. These systems arehighly susceptible to heat build-up  and fail rapidly if subjected to  overheating conditions. This situationmakes air conditioning support critical to these mission-e ssential facilities. As a  general rule, air condi-tioning systems are more vulnerable than their heating counterparts. Most critical climate control systemcomponents are located externally to the facility they serve and therefore are more susceptible to damage.Two air conditioning or r efrigeration systems are used by the Air  Force: the vapor compression systemand the absorption system. The vapor compression system is the most common. 5.4.1.  Repair of Air C onditioning Systems. Typical air conditioning repairs tend to be manpowerintensive and usually take a considerable amount of time. Like heating systems, air conditioning sup-port is highly dependent on a reliable electric supply. In addition to being time intensive, it is commonto have a very large number of unit and system va riations present on the average base. These factorsmake developing an expedient repair strategy and standardized repair kit to satisfy all potential needsboth cost prohibitive and virtually impossible. Expedient repairs may typically involve replacing partsand locating and repairing leaks within the system. 5.4.1.1.  Replacing Parts. If system rejuvenation is pl ausible and parts are not available in a stan-dardized repair kit, consider  obtaining needed parts from similar  units that support less criticalfunctions. 5.4.1.2.  Leak Testing and Repair. If a mission-essential refrigeration unit is operable except forminor leaks after a natural disaster or damage from attack, the usual first course of action would beto charge the unit as a temporary measure and move on to the next issue. However, if the situationallows for a more concerted effort, permanent repairs should always be considered to avoid dupli-cation of effort. When a leak is found and repaired, the complete unit should be rechecked not onlyto confirm the repair, but also to ensure that there are no additional leaks. 5.4.1.2.1.  The method for leak testi ng varies with the refrigerant used. However, most meth-ods involve applying pressure to the system with an inert gas, such as nitrogen or carbon diox-ide. With proper care, nitrogen or carbon dioxide may be used safely when pressure-testing forleaks. However, be aware that  the pressure in a  nitrogen cylinder is us ually about 2,000-psiand the pressure in a carbon dioxide cylinder is normally about 800-psi. Consequently, a pres-sure-reducing device that has both  a pressure regulator and reli ef valve must always be usedwhen testing with either of these gases. Check the system’s nameplate before conducting thistype of test. In most cases, it  will provide recommended testing pressures. If this informationis not provided, UUnever UU test all or part of  a hermetic sy stem at pressures exceeding170-psi. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 20081115.4.1.2.2.  Many companies recommend using the refrigerant in the system to test for leaks. Insuch situations, sensitive elect ronic leak detectors like thos e addressed below should beemployed. 5.4.1.3.  Leak Detection Devices. As a general rule , refrigeration system  leaks are usually verytiny and require sensitive dete cting devices. Commonly used  detection devices include bubblesolutions, fluorescent dye, and electronic detection devices such as the corona discharge (Figure5.5.), heated diode (Figure 5.6.), and UV lamps. The newer electronic detectors can be used withR-134a, R-123, and other new alternative refrigerants. Figure 5.5.  Corona Tester. 112AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 5.6.  Heated Diode Tester. 5.4.2.  Alternative Air Conditioning Sources. If ai r conditioning systems cannot be expedientlyrepaired after an attack or natu ral disaster, portable units are the ideal w ay to go u ntil time andresources allow permanent repairs. A number of BTU vari ations are available that support air condi-tioning requirements, ranging from small area units to large package configurations used for coolingentire buildings. Two examples of large portable units are shown in Figure 5.7. Figure 5.7.  Typical Large Portable Air Conditioning Units. 5.5.  Electrical System. After an attack or disast er, power for airfield lighting, navigational aids(NAVAIDS), communications centers, C2 nodes, medical facilities, and other important activities must berestored before the installation can resume its operational mission. If the attack  or disaster resulted indowned or damaged electrical lines, the repair or isolation of life-threatening electrical hazards must alsoreceive high priority. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 20081135.5.1.  Basic Safety Rules. Detailed safety procedures for electrical repair operations are contained inAir Force criteria and must be strictly followed. Electrical safety requirements in AFI 32-1064, Elec-trical Safe Practices, and UFC 3-560-01, Electrical Safety O&M, are mandatory and outline the typeof arc thermal performance value (ATVP) rated PPE to wear when working on or near energized cir-cuits, when work on or near energized circuits is authorized, and who is the energized work authority.Table 4-2 in UFC 3-560-0 defines hazard./risk category classifications for work tasks. As outlined inAFI 32-1064 and UFC 3-560-01, work on or near energized lines and equipment is prohibited exceptin rare circumstances and then only when appr oved in advance by the  BCE or equivalent. Whenauthorized, the energized work will only be performed after the energized work permit completion isaccomplished IAW AFI 32-1064. 5.5.2.  Primary and Secondary Circuits. The electrical system can be divided into two major sub-systems: primary circuits and secondary circuits. Circuits above 600 volts are generally referred to asprimary or feeder circuits. Circuits carrying less than 600 volts are usually referred to as low voltageor secondary circuits. Even in a contingency situation, work on the high-voltage primary systems willbe performed only by craftsmen with specialized qualifications and equipment. 5.5.3.  Components of Electrical System. The electrical system supporting a typical installationconsists of three components: pr oduction, distribution, and interior  wiring. Each component of thesystem should be viewed in term s of its anticipated da mage during a continge ncy and the expedientrepair techniques needed to adequately remedy the damage. 5.5.3.1.  Production Systems. At overseas installations, electrical power  is either supplied bybase power plants or commercial sources. In the CONUS, primary power is most likely providedby a commercial grid. If the commercial source is interrupted, usually the only alternative is to dis-connect the impaired po wer source from the dist ribution system and su bstitute generators topower vital facilities. Most mission-essential facilities already have dedicated standby generatorswith an automatic transfer capability to maintain operations in the event the prime power is lost. 5.5.3.2.  Distribution Systems. The power distribution system  may consist of substations,switchgear, and utility lines that are either overhead or underground. Overhead power lines and theassociated utility poles are likely to suffer extensive damage during a hurricane, tornado, or enemyattack. An underground system, although better protected from th e high winds common to hurri-canes and tornadoes, is still vul nerable to the effects of an earthquake, flooding, or enemy muni-tions. There are three basic ty pes of distribution  systems: radial, loop, and network. Anycombination of these three systems can be found at most installations. 5.5.3.2.1.  Radial System. The radial layout is one in which a  mainline is established throughthe approximate center of an installation and branch lines are run from the main to power var-ious facilities. A very basic radial layout is shown in Figure 5.8. The primary disadvantage ofthe radial layout is that a break of wires at point "B" results in a complete loss of power to allfacilities on the installation. Thus, the radial system is less effective since it is very susceptibleto extreme weather conditions, war damage, a nd sabotage. However, since the radial systemrequires considerably less material, manpower, and time to construct, radial systems are oftenused during contingency beddowns. 5.5.3.2.2.  Loop System. A loop or ring layout supplies power to a facility from more than onedirection as shown in  Figure 5.9. Note that a break in the circ uit at point "A" will not causecomplete power failure since power may still be  distributed through the lower section of the114AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008loop. Thus, a loop system has an inherent capabi lity to prevent complete power loss of allfacilities. Faults in the circuit can be isolated and repaired without large disruption of service.In addition, the loop layout normally distributes  power with less voltage drop. The primarydisadvantage of the loop system is that it requires more material and time to construct than theradial system. Figure 5.8.  Basic Radial Layout. Figure 5.9.  Basic Loop Layout. 5.5.3.2.3.  Network System. A network system is simply a merger of both the radial and loopsystems. In particular, it uses the independent feeder  system of the radi al system to supplypower to distribution tran sformers while also paralleling th e secondary lines that are used inthe loop concept. This c onfiguration capitalizes on the strong individual  points of both theradial and loop systems, thereby allowing optimum flexibility and efficiency. 5.5.3.3.  Interior Wiring. After transmission and distribution systems, the “third leg” of the elec-trical system is the interior wiring. It generally consists of the electrical wiring, switches, outlets,circuit breakers, and other electrical accessories  located within a building after the serviceentrance interface. 5.5.4.  Repairing Electrical Systems. After assessing the initial damage to an electrical system afteran attack or disaster, the first action should be  the isolation of those  damaged areas presentingAFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008115life-threatening hazards to personnel or posing the potential for additional property damage. Once ini-tial isolation is accomplished, damage control center (DCC) personnel, using installation utility plansand maps, determine how to best restore electrical power to vital installation facilities. Typically, thisis accomplished by rerouting po wer lines to bypass damaged area s. After damage assessment datahave been posted to the installati on utility maps, the DCC  should be able to quickly direct electricalsystem rerouting using the existing, undamaged  circuits. When rerouting around damaged areas,remember that non-standard materials can be used provided they do  not jeopardize safety. If capableof carrying the required loads, wires and cables of different sizes or those normally designed for otheruses may be substituted as expedient power lines. Strictly adhere to electrical safety requirements out-lined in previous paragraphs and  ensure proper “phasing” of cond uctors is accomplished. Addition-ally, conductors, wire, and other components may be  salvaged from unimportant or abandonedfacilities. 5.5.4.1.  Repairing Power Production System. The extent of damage to an independent power pro-duction plant on the installation will vary with th e type of emergency that has occurred. Naturaldisasters, such as hurric anes and tornadoes, are likely to cause st ructural damage to the plant aswell as disrupt the plant’s connections to the distribution system . An enemy attack will probablycause structural damage and disruption of connections to the distribution system, and it may pro-duce damage to other components of the power system; e.g., demolished control equipment, bro-ken turbine blades, and shattered  insulators and bushings. In re pairing such damage, take fulladvantage of bench stocks maintained by each  power plant or draw on base supply sources. As alast resort, try cannibalization. Generators, as an alternate power source, will probably be in shortsupply, making it imperative that these vital assets be properly positioned and maintained. Gener-ators should be limite d to providing power to only those faci lities that are absolutely crucial tobase operations. AFI 32-1063, Electric Power Systems, shall be used to determine those facilitiesthat are authorized emergency or standby generators. Consider damaged or inoperative generatorsas a source of spare parts. Com ponents and parts from several da maged generators may be reas-sembled to produce one usable machine. Equipment other than disabled generators may serve as asource of repair parts; e.g., inje ctors from a diesel e ngine in a destroyed ve hicle can be salvagedand adapted to a generator engine. 5.5.4.2.  Repairing Power  Distribution System. Expedient repairs to power distribution systemsare limited by the extent of damage involved and av ailability of spare parts. A large part of mostelectrical distribution systems is composed of non-repairable items such as poles, insulators, crossarms, switch gear, and in most cases, transformers. Only a few items within the electrical distribu-tion system lend themselves to  repair. Items such as conduct ors, grounding wires, guy wires,anchors, service entrances, and occasionally transformers fall into this category. 5.5.4.2.1.  Conductors. Overhead power lines may need to be hung  from trees, existing struc-tures or new poles. In some instances, cutting the damaged line on both sides of the destructionand bridging the area with new cable may be n ecessary. If it does not pose a danger , run thenew power cable directly on th e ground. It can always be pr operly buried or  elevated whentime and resources are more available. Low-volt age distribution cables can be placed or runalong the ground. Conductors that cross roads or  pathways must be buried or protected bysome means at the crossing. Figure 5.10. and Figure 5.11. show two different techniques forsuch crossings. The former displays a commercial cable protector bei ng used, and the lattershows how to protect cables using PVC and sandbags. The latter figure also has the cables onboth sides of the road protected from foot traffic by sandbags. Schedule 40 Polyvinyl Chloride116AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008(PVC) conduit with a diameter of 3 to 4 inches is suitable for expedient raceways under cross-ings. In applications for which excessively high roadway temperatures are expected, Schedule80 PVC should be used if available. For average temperatures over 90°F, the number of cablesper raceway should be limited to three to prevent insulation overheating. In addition, the race-way in this application must also have at least 60 percent air space in its section to reduce thepossibility of overheating. Figure 5.10.  Commercial Cable Protector Across Roadway. 5.5.4.2.1.1.  Cable Burial Requirements. As manpower becomes available, the cables thatwere placed on the ground should be direct-buried to protect them from threat, equipment,and personnel damage; to prevent deterioration by the elements; and to improve their cur-rent- carrying ability. In moderate temperature locations, a burial depth of 8 inches for sec-ondary cable and 18 inches for primary cable is normally adequate. However , in siteswhere high temperature is anticipated, ensure that the secondary cable has at least 12 to 16inches of cover. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008117Figure 5.11.  Underground Roadway Crossing. 5.5.4.2.1.2.  Buried Cable Grounding. To save time and labor, distribution cables can beplaced in trenches along with water and san itary lines. To reduce personnel exposure toelectrical hazard, it is highl y advisable to place a bare c opper conductor in the trenchalongside the cables if the cable does not have  concentric neutral wires inside the cablejacket. This conductor must be bare and solidly attached to the generator ground terminaland to the frames of all connected electrical equipment. The size of  the bare conductorshould be close to the size of the largest insulated conductor in the trench. 5.5.4.2.2.  Grounding Wires and Rods. Proper grounding of elect rical systems is essential tothe safe operation of the system. Grounding is most of ten accomplished by driving groundrods into the ground with a minimum 1/0 American Wire Gage (AWG) bare copper wire fromthe ground rod to either the device or system to be grounded. The spacing and depth of groundrods depends upon the resistance to ground to the earth at the site. In the absence of the capa-bility to measure the resistance to ground and determine actual grounding requirements for thesite, use a 3/4-inch diameter metal water pipe with at least 10 feet in contact with the earth, ora ground rod driven at least 8 fe et into the earth or into th e permanent ground water level, ifknown. Electrical continuity is essential in a grounding system; therefore, all connections mustbe clean and properly bonded. The design and application of grounding to an electrical systemshould normally be inherent in the system installation and not something that is added at a laterdate. 5.5.4.2.3.  Guys (Wires and Anchors). Expedient repairs to guys usually involve replacing orresetting guy wires and anchors  while raising new poles or br acing existing poles. In newwork, guys should generally be installed before power line wires are strung. In reconstructionwork, guys should be installed before making any changes in the line wires while at the sametime being careful not to place excessive pu ll on the pole and wi res already in position.Improperly or inadequately guyed power lines will soon begin to sag, degrading the reliabilityof the line. When replacing guy wires, determine the condition of the pole before removing the118AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008old guy wire. If the pole is we ak, it should be securely bra ced before any changes in polestrains are made. Make sure the guy wire is installed so there is minimal interference with theclimbing space on the pole, and guys should clear all energized wires. In some cases, it may benecessary to install a guy hook to prevent the guy from slipping down the pole. Position thesehooks so they do not interfere with climbing and cannot be used as steps. Where guys are lia-ble to cut into the surface of a pole, protect the pole by installing a guy plate at the attachmentpoint. The plate should be well secured to the pol e to prevent the possibility of injury to aworker climbing up or down the pole. When guys  are installed near roadways, position themso they do not interfere with st reet or roadway traf fic. Guys located near streets should beequipped with yellow traffic guards (sometimes called "anchor shields"). Any guy wires con-taining snarls or kinks should not be used for line work, and it is preferable to use guy wires ofthe correct length to avoid unnecessary splices. The type of anchor used in these repairs mustprovide suitable resistance to up lift and is therefore dependen t on the condition of the soil.Table 5.2. indicates suitable anchor types based on a range of soils from hard to soft. While thesoil descriptions are not an i ndustry standard, manufacturers are  familiar with this or similarclassifications. For the majority of cases, the  most suitable anchor is an expanding type ( Fig-ure 5.12.), because most lines are installed in ordinary soils. Table 5.2.  Anchors Suitable for Various Soils.

Expanding Anchor Details. 1195.5.4.2.4.  Service Entrances. During the aftermath of an attack or disaster, it may become nec-essary to repair or build ne w service entrances with expedi ent methods and materials. Newinstallations would be intended as temporary measures only and would be upgraded as the sit-uation stabilizes or used where the location is intended only as a one-time, short-term develop-ment. An electrical service entrance is the point at which electrical service enters a facility, andit normally consists of a main junction box, circuit breakers or fuses, and any other equipmentlocated between the main junctio n and service drop, including  meters. An expedient serviceentrance can be constructed as follows: 5.5.4.2.4.1.  If service entrance cable is available, a weather head can be formed with plas-tic electrician’s tape that will effectively seal moisture out of the cable insulation for a ser-vice entrance purpose (Figure 5.13.). Individually insulated wires can be bundled, tiedwith marline, and wrapped with tape to form a service entrance cable. Should plastic tapenot be available, friction tape  can be used to wrap the cabl e; however, if friction tape isused, it should be coated with varnish to render it waterproof before installation. 5.5.4.2.4.2.  Normally, split bolt connectors or compression splices will be used to connectthe service entrance conductors to the service drop conduc tors. In an emergency whereboth conductors are solid, terminal loops can  be turned in the conductors and a bolt withtwo washers can be used  to make the connection ( Figure 5.14.). This type of connectionshould be taped on all hot conductors, but tape is not required for the neutral conductor. 120AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 5.13.  Taped Weather Head. Figure 5.14.  Emergency Service Entrance Connection. 5.5.4.2.4.3.  If circuit breaker panels  or mains are not available,  using safety switches forservice equipment can protect light loads. It may be necessary to bridge one set of contactsinside the switch so that the  neutral will be a solid, unbroken circuit. The hot circuits canthen be fused to the proper ampaci ty through the operating contacts ( Figure 5.15.). Keepin mind that this is  an emergency situation and that  the fuses should be well below theampacity of the branch circuits  installed to protect the ins ulation of these branch circuits.Regardless of circumstances, some method must be provided to open all circuits within thestructure with a maximum of five hand motions. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008121Figure 5.15.  Safety Switch Used as Service Equipment. 5.5.4.2.5.  Transformer Repair. Expedient repair of transformers can be accomplished if thedamage is not too extensive. Cracks or holes in the tank can be patched by welding, providedtesting indicates that internal windings have  not been compromised. T ransformers can bereturned to service after being thoroughly dried and replacing lost or contaminated oil. Keep inmind that oil from damaged transformers must be filtered before being reused and that motoroil is not a satisfactory  substitute for transformer use (a transformer requires a highly refinedmineral oil free from moisture or other impurities). In most case s, there will not be sufficientspare transformers available to provide a one-for -one replacement for damaged units. Forexample, you may not have a single-phase transformer with the capacity for the required load.In such a case, it may be necessary to parallel two smaller transformers in order to supply theload (Figure 5.16.). This expedient solution will solve an immediate problem, but it is not costeffective and should be replaced when the correct equipment becomes available. In a situationwhere three-phase power is n eeded and one  transformer out of the three is damaged,three-phase power can still be provided by making what are commonly called open-delta con-nections. Figure 5.17. shows the open-delta connection wh en a four-wire, three-phase wyeprimary is involved. Figure 5.18. illustrates the connections that must be made to achieve theopen-delta connection when a three-wire, three-phase delta primary is involved. Regardless ofthe type of primary involved, these connections  are used only for emer gency situations andshould not be  constructed as per manent installations. The two transf ormers used in theopen-delta connection will only supply 86.6 percent of their rated capacity. The total capacityof the bank will be only 57.7 percent of the original bank capacity. 122AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 5.16.  Paralleling Single Phase Transformers. Figure 5.17.  Open–Delta With Wye Primary. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008123Figure 5.18.  Open-Delta With Delta Primary. 5.5.4.3.  Repairing Interior Wiring. Expedient repairs to the interi or wiring of a structure dependon the extent of da mage and the criticality of th e facility. If the facility is not criti cal to currentbase recovery operations, delay repairs until additional resources are available. For facilities con-sidered essential to base operations, determin e the minimum level of required electrical service.Does an entire structure need power or only a small portion of it? What type of equipment will theelectrical system of the building be required to support? Will it only need minimum electrical volt-age to provide lighting, or are th ere requirements for specialized voltages to power large air con-ditioning units, refrigeration units, or X-ray machines? For exam ple, there is no need to devoteexcessive manpower and materials to complete restoration of the base hospital’s electrical systemif the hospital staf f needs only one section of th e building and one X-ray  machine. In this case,electrical wiring in this section of the building could be restored and a special high-voltage cablecould be run to operate the X-ray machine. 5.5.4.3.1.  When making expedient repairs to the interior wiring, use undamaged wiring to themaximum extent possible. This  will cut repair time and r esult in fewer exposed live circuitswhen the facility is returned to operation. As with distribution systems, damaged areas can bebypassed with new wiring to complete a vital circuit. 5.5.4.3.2.  When bypassing damaged areas or running temporary lines into a structure, wiringcan be run across floors and other building surfaces to expedite repairs. However, if the facilitywill have a high volume of pers onnel traffic, tack the wiring to  the wall or ceiling to preventfurther damage or hazards. The  temporary wiring does not  have to be conc ealed to present afinished appearance; it only needs to be functional and out of the way of heavy traffic (Figure5.19.). 124AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 5.19.  Installation of Temporary Interior Wiring. 5.5.4.3.3.  Another important  consideration in the  expedient repair of in terior electrical sys-tems is the supply of wiring, switches, and a ssociated hardware needed to make repairs.Depending on the extent of damage, base supply sources may not have adequate levels to pro-vide for all repair needs. In  these cases, cannibalization and  substitution become very impor-tant. At theater locations, many  components will be of foreign manufacture and not readilyavailable through US supply channels, making it imperative that repair crews salvage as muchas possible. Structures declared irreparable may contain switches, wiring, and other hardwarethat can be u sed to restore electrical services to other structures. A note of caution: do notinflict additional or  unnecessary damage during salvage attempts. S tructures being salvagedmay have to be rehabilitated in the future. 5.5.5.  Foreign Wiring Systems. Another type of contingency situation involves reactivating an estab-lished installation in a foreign country. In this case, the facilities on the installation would be intact butpossibly requiring renovation or modifications. 5.5.5.1.  Foreign Systems Interface. The primary di fference between US and foreign wiring sys-tems is that most foreign systems  have not be en installed according to the standards  outlined bythe US National Electric Code (NEC). This fact may be attributed largely to the material shortagesin many foreign countries, particularly economica lly depressed nations, which have dictated theuse of materials at hand. Additional details rega rding material variances and electrical systemcomparisons are described in the following paragraphs. 5.5.5.1.1.  Voltage. The U.S. uses  nominal voltages th at range from 120 to  240 volts for sin-gle-phase alternating current (AC) and 208 to 600 volts for three-phase AC in low-voltage dis-tribution systems. A considerable number of  foreign countries use other voltages, requiringour electrical equipment to be converted, modified, or operated inefficiently when powered bythese foreign electrical systems. 5.5.5.1.2.  Frequency. The standard frequency of AC distribution in the US is 60 Hertz (Hz). Inmany foreign lands, 50-c ycle frequency generation is common; but the electrician may alsoencounter frequencies such as 25, 40, 42, and  100 cycles. General guidelines for using 60 Hzelectrical equipment on 50 Hz power sources is provided in paragraph 5.5.5.4. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 20081255.5.5.1.3.  Materials. The wiring materials commonl y used in foreign countries are normallypeculiar to the country’s manufacture. The US employs the American Wire Gage (AWG) sys-tem, which is peculiar to US installations. Most foreign wire will differ in size and use. Also,receptacles, switches, and plugs used in foreign wiring systems are different and normally can-not be mated or used with similar American -manufactured components. Be aware that prob-lems may be cr eated when dissimila r materials are used interchangeably in apower-distribution system. The close association of dissimilar metals may cause galvanic cor-rosion at the joints that eventually destroys the usefulness of the equipment. This is a particularconcern when aluminum  and copper are joined. New materi als are especially made for con-nection to copper or aluminum  with no adverse ef fects and will be a ppropriately marked.Except in emergency expedient installation, dissimilar metals must never be used together. Ifaluminum is exclusively used in a system, a special joint compound must be applied to all con-nections or joints to protect against excess surface oxidation. The oxide of an aluminum con-ductor differs from copper oxide in that it adds a high contact resistance to the wire. 5.5.5.2.  Expedient Procedures Involving Foreign  Systems. During contingency operations in aforeign country, the Air Force may use all or part of an electrical system on a foreign installation.Though the decision of employment  is largely determined by the  immediate circumstances, theAir Force electrician or unit commander will foll ow one of two general procedures as outlinedbelow. 5.5.5.2.1.  Since the electrical components of a fo reign and domestic electrical system cannotbe interchanged, the decision may be made to use all foreign equipment. The obvious problemin this decision is one of supply. The parts needed may not be readily available. 5.5.5.2.2.  If time is a consequential factor , consideration should be given  to the use of stan-dard electrical items made in the US and the modification of plugs or connections so that theymay be used in the foreign system. Although this method usually results in decreased operat-ing efficiency, the ease of adaptability and abundance of supplies usually outweigh the reduc-tion in performance. 5.5.5.3.  Different Voltage Effects. Whenever possible, all equipment should be operated at itsrated voltage. To expedite foreign system use, items built to operate at standard American voltagesmay have to function at dif ferent voltages. Though such items may not be operated ef ficiently,their availability for use may be an important military need. Some effects of voltage differences oncommon electrical devices are explained below. 5.5.5.3.1.  Lighting Fixtures. When fluorescent  lamps are operated at voltages higher thanstandard, both the lamp and ballast life are shortened. Line voltages below the minimum of theoperating ranges of 110-125, 199-216, or 220-250 vo lts will cause uncertain star ting, shortlamp life, and reduced lighting efficiency. When incandescent lamps are used and operated atvoltages higher than their ratings of 114, 120, and 125 volts, they also have a shortened lamplife below that expected; but their light output is increased. Conv ersely, if the line voltage ofoperation is below standard, the life of the la mp is increased; but the lighting ef ficiency isreduced approximately 3 percent for each 1 percent drop in rated voltage. 5.5.5.3.2.  Motors. Ro tating equipment, such as motors an d fans, is usually manufactured tooperate with a permissible volta ge variation of 10 percent with in their prescribed rating. Thecombined voltage and frequency variation is al so limited to 10 percent. Higher voltages give126AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008increased torque, increased ef ficiency, and increased starting  temperature. Operating at volt-ages differing from rated voltages by more th an 10 percent may be permitted only in anextreme emergency since the eq uipment may be damaged or ev en destroyed by such ope ra-tions. 5.5.5.4.  Different Frequency Effects. Electrical operating items based on resistance characteristics(such as heaters, hot plates, and electric sto ves) operate efficiently over all ranges of distributionfrequencies used throughout the US and foreign territories. Rotating equipment and items such aslights and transmission or receiving equipment are adversely affected by variations in frequency.Some of the effects of frequency changes on this type of equipment are described below. 5.5.5.4.1.  Resistive Load s. Fluorescent lights rated to oper ate at a nominal 60-cycle currentcan be used at 50 cycles, but with a shorter ball ast life. At lower than 60-cycle frequencies, anoticeable flicker in the light output can be de tected. This is undesirable where painstakingand meticulous work is being performed. Operation at lower frequency is not satisfactory andshould be avoided. Incandescent lights, because  of their resistance design, will operate satis-factorily at all of the frequencies encountered overseas. However, lamps designed to functionat 60 Hz will not burn as brightly at 50 Hz and ovens will not be as hot. 5.5.5.4.2.  Static Induction Devices. Distribution transformers, electric discharge lighting bal-lasts, series lighting current regulators, and  other static inductive equipment induce magneticenergy fields in iron as  part of their normal operation. The  magnetic flux density is directlyproportional to the volts/hertz ratio of the pow er source. Consequently, the voltage must bereduced proportionally to maintain the volts/hertz ratio at the design point. 5.5.5.4.3.  Transmitting Equipment. All receiving and transmitting  equipment, or other itemswhich have transformers  included in their wiring, will not  operate satisfactorily either belowor above their rated line freque ncy and should be used only in  an emergency. In some cases,there may be frequency converters available, part icularly in flight line operations, which canbe obtained and used when the equipment operation is mission essential. 5.5.5.4.4.  Induction Motors. Induction motors rated for 60 Hz operation will run at about 5/6of rated speed when connected to a 50 Hz source. Consequently, if a motor is nominally ratedto run at 1800 rpm at 60 cycles and is operated at 50 cycles, its output speed will be reduced toapproximately 1500 rpm. Motor current varies inversely with both source frequency and volt-age. As the 50 Hz source voltage is reduced, motor current heating the winding increases whileiron loss heating is decreasing. No amount of voltage reduction can compensate for both heat-ing effects simultaneously. However, induction motors rated at 120V, 60 Hz will operate suc-cessfully at about 110V, 50 Hz if the speed reduction can be tolerated. Keep in mind that somemotors are built to function at either 50 or 60 cycles. 5.5.5.5.  Electric Motor Voltage/Hertz Variation Remedies. Corrective me asures for two of themore common major electric motor problems re lated to voltage and he rtz incompatibilities areprovided below. 5.5.5.5.1.  Motor Heating Due to Iron Saturation.  Motor geometry establishes a design volts/hertz ratio. As addressed earlier, if the motor will be operated at less than designed frequency,then the voltage must be reduced  proportionately (5/6) to maintain the vo lts/hertz ratio at orbelow the design limit. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 20081275.5.5.5.2.  Reduced Moto r Shaft Speed. Shaft speed is a  function of source frequency andmotor configuration. The coupling  to the drive load often invol ves belts, pulleys, chains, orgears. A change in drive ratio s could correct the speed. Howe ver, many loads operate ade-quately at 5/6 of design speed. 5.5.6.  Miscellaneous Reference Ma terial. The next few page s list reference information regardingload-carrying capacity of wire, load current and circuit breaker sizes for AC motors, a description ofcommon AWG wire sizes, types, and general uses along with pole sizing and setting specifications. 5.5.6.1.  Wire Size and Voltage Drop Determination. The size of wire for a given section of a sys-tem is selected based on the amount of electrical load that it must carry and on the allowable volt-age drop. Note the larger the wire size, the greater its capacity and the less resistance it will have,hence, less voltage drop. Economy, however, should be considered  in size determination.  Table5.3. shows the KVA (kilovolts-amperes) and current-carrying capacities for wires ranging fromNo. 8 to a 4/0. In addition, Table 5.4. lists current and circuit breaker sizes for AC motors.

Conductor Types. Conductors used in installation overhead distribution systems are usu-ally copper, although they may be steel, aluminum, or combinations of these metals. Figure 5.20.provides information regarding common AWG wire sizes, types, and app lications. In addition,Table 5.5., Table 5.6., and Table 5.7. list the wire sizes for 120-volt, single-phase circuits, numberof wires allowable in various conduits, and th e wire sizes for 240-volt,  single-phase circuits,respectively. Lastly, Figure 5.21. shows four of the more common wire splice techniques in usetoday. 5.5.6.2.1.  Copper Conductors. Copper has high conductivity and is easily spliced. Hard-drawnor medium-hard-drawn copper is desirable for distribution conductors because of its strength.Since heating and cooling redu ces the wire's tensile stre ngth from 50,000-psi to 35,000-psi,soldered splices should not be used on hard-drawn copper wire because the hot solder weakensthe joints. Splicing sleeves are normally used when making joints. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 20081295.5.6.2.2.  Steel Conductors. Steel wire used as a conductor permits long spans because of itshigh tensile strength. S teel has about 10 to 15 percent as much  conductivity size-for-size ascopper, but the short life and low conductivity of steel wire are overcome, to some extent, bythe use of copper-clad steel made by welding a copper coating to the steel wire. 5.5.6.2.3.  Weatherproofing. Triple-braid weatherproofing is preferred to double braid.Improved types of weatherproofing include plastic covering and layers of impregnated unspuncotton or impregnated rubber filler. Before these newer type coverings are used, approvalshould be obtained from the higher command having jurisdiction. Figure 5.20.  Wire Sizes, Types, and Uses. 5.5.6.2.4.  Primary Distribution. For  primary distribution below 5,000 volts, either bare orweatherproof conductors may be used. The ordina ry weatherproof covering is not to be con-130AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008sidered as insulation, although  it does prevent breakdowns  on the lower primary voltagescaused by conductors swinging together . For all primary distribution over 5,000 volts, bareconductors are ordinarily used. 5.5.6.2.5.  Secondary Distribution. Weatherproof wires are us ed for secondary distribution.The weatherproof covering is an ef fective insulation for secondary voltages, permittingrack-type distribution and closely spaced secondary conductors. No wire smaller than a No. 8should be used for secondary distribution or for any external transmission of power. Table 5.5.  Wire Sizes for 120-Volt, Single-Phase Circuits.

Common Wire Splices. 1335.5.6.3.  Overhead Distribution Pole Requirements. At established installations, electrical distribu-tion lines are often overhead, supported by poles or strung from building to building. As a generalrule, lines carrying over  240 volts are supporte d on poles while those  carrying 120 to 240 voltsmay be supported on masts or  insulators attached to buildings. Service wire s should be kept a tleast 3 feet from windows and 8 inches above flat roofs. Since theater of operations electrical dis-tribution systems are exclusively overhead systems, wooden poles similar to those used in civilianconstruction are used to carry the conductors.  Unlike civilian construction, cross arms are notoften used at overseas installa tions. Instead, conductors are hung  directly on the pole, one abovethe other. 5.5.6.3.1.  Pole Selection. The poles used in a distribution  system should consist of a goodgrade of timber that will last. Good pressure-treated Texas southern pine, for example, can beexpected to last 35 to 50 years.  Conversely, untreated local timber such as soft pine may lastonly a couple of years and have a useful life of only one season under unfavorable conditions.However, the fact that a pole is in good condition is not proof that it can satisfactorily supportthe line. Poles must withstand column loadings as well as transverse loads from wind and turnsin the line. 5.5.6.3.2.  Pole Height and Class. Table 5.8. shows the required heights and classes of polesfor various types of loadings in military installations. The smaller a class number the sturdierthe pole. The class of a given  pole depends on its length, di ameter, and the materi al fromwhich it is made. The height  is governed by restrictions  both above and below the proposedconductors. Near airfields, poles must be kept low, yet high enough to provide adequate clear-ance over streets and roads. Co rner poles, transformer poles,  and the like are usually one ormore classes heavier and sometimes 5 feet higher than line poles. Table 5.9. gives the requiredclasses for transformer poles. 134AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Table 5.8.  Height and Class of Power Poles.

Vertical wire spacing is the clear distance between wir es.Six-inch minimum spacing is re quired for spans up to and incl uding 200 feet  while 12-inchminimum spacing is required for spans over 200 feet. A clear space is always left at the top ofan electrical pole. This distance is equal to the wire spacing, that is, 6 inches for 200-foot spansand less and 12 inches for spans greater than 200 feet. 5.5.6.3.4.  Setting Poles. Poles should be set deep enough to develop their full bending strengthat the ground line. Table 5.10. gives the recommended setting depths in soil and in rock. Theactual setting or installation of the poles is  done by one of three  methods: by hand, with acrane, or by using a nearby pole as a gin pole. 37 ½ 75 100 AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Table 5.10.

Clearances. Minimum clearances of conductors over ground, rails, and other objectsare given in  Figure 5.22. Special consideration must be gi ven to railroad yards and materialhandling areas. Allow a minimum horizontal clearance of 11 inches from the outside face of acurb or roadbed to the face of  the pole to prevent damage by  vehicles. The clearances shownmay be decreased in theater of  operations construction where safety factors are reduced. Theengineer officer must use sound judgment in  establishing minimum clearances for a givenproject, taking into account materials available, military necessity, urgency of the project, andother factors. 136AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 5.22.

Introduction. Sanitation during beddown operations or contingencies in cludes providing facilitiesfor disposal of human waste and ba sic personal hygiene. Prepackaged de ployable facilities like those inFigure 6.1. are part of BEAR packages that support deployed forces when there are inadequate or no san-itary systems available. However, expedient methods must be available to  provide crude, temporaryamenities until these deployable prepackaged facilities arrive. 6.2.  Overview. This chapter presents basic data and concepts to help personnel provide rudimentary san-itation facilities for initially deployed forces and  during contingencies. These concepts can be expandedby duplication to support additiona l people but are not c onsidered long-term solutions. Facilitiesaddressed in this chapt er consist of expedient field latrines, urin als, and hand-washing stations. Theseconcepts should help personnel accomplish the minimum  requirements for sanitation needs until addi-tional, more permanent resources are obtained. Figure 6.1.  Typical Deployment Package Sanitary Asset. 6.3.  Human Waste Disposition Policy. Air Force policy directs that hum an waste be disposed of withgood sanitary practices; and the Air Force must comply with federal, state, and local environmental lawsfor human waste. Few laws specifical ly address human waste disposal in  the field; nevertheless, properhuman waste disposal is essential to maintaining good health and requires command emphasis at all lev-els. For more information on managing waste disposal, see AFH 10-222, Volume 4, Environmental Guidefor Contingency Operations Overseas, and FM 3-100.4, Environmental Considerations in Military Oper-ations. 6.3.1.  Responsibilities. At installation level, base  engineers are responsible for constructing, main-taining, and operating fixed sewage systems. Commanders are responsible for providing human wastedisposal facilities in the field. During contingencie s when deployable kits are not available, engineersupport will be required to construct various types of field disposal devices. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 20081476.3.2.  Field Facility Considerations. The type of field latrine selected for a given situation dependson a number of factors–the number of personnel, the duration of the stay at the site, and geological andclimatic conditions. Preventive-medicine personnel can assist in determining the right type, location,number, and size of latrines. The locations of base  camp latrines are usually a compromise betweenthe requirement for separation from dining facilities and water sources and convenience for personnel.Multiple latrine sites are clearly necessary for larger base camps. Sanitation and maintenance are crit-ical to prevent disease transmission to and from personnel. 6.4.  Latrine Facilities. Expedient latrin es are basic versions of either  pit or aboveground drum- typelatrines. They are intended for temporary use until more suitable facilities are erected or while an existingsanitary sewer system is being rehabilitated. 6.4.1.  Basic Field Requirements. The following general rules apply to constructing all types of pitlatrines, except cat holes. T o ensure that food a nd water are protected from contamination, latrinesshould be at least 100 yards from  the dining facility a nd 100 feet from the nearest water source.Latrines should not be dug below the groundwater table or where they may drain into a water source.(The groundwater table can be determined from information given by local inhabitants or excavatingto the groundwater table.) Latrines are usually built at least 30 yards from the end of the unit area butwithin a reasonable distance for easy access. They  should be lighted at night  if the military situationpermits. If lights cannot be used, tie pieces of cord or  tape to trees or stakes as guides to the latrines.Note: Latrines must be policed daily. Specific unit personnel are to  be assigned the responsibility ofensuring that the latrines are always properly maintained. 6.4.1.1.  Drainage and Fly Control. Place a canvas or b rush screen around  each latrine orenclose it in a tent. If  possible, heat the shelter in cold cl imates. Dig a drainage ditch around thescreen or tent to prevent water from flowing over the ground into the latrine. For fly control, spraythe shelter with an insecticide twice a week. If fly problems persist, spray the pit contents and boxinterior twice a week with a residual insecticide. 6.4.1.2.  Latrine Closing Procedures. Close a latrine pit when it is f illed to within 1 f oot of thesurface or when it is being abandoned. Remove the latrine box and close as follows: (1) fill the pitto the surface with successive, 3-inch layers of earth and pack each layer down, (2) place a l-footmound of dirt over the length of the pit to prevent  fly pupa from getting out of the closed latrine,and (3) install a rectangular sign on top of the mound. The sign should indicate the type of pit andthe date closed; include the unit designation in non-operational areas. 6.4.2.  Types of Field Latrines.  6.4.2.1.  Pit Latrines. There are several versions of the pit latrine and as the name suggests, itinvolves digging a pit in the ground. This type of latrine is normally used where the groundwatertable is deep enough to prevent gr oundwater contamination or water standing in the latrine pit. Itis also limited to areas that are free of impervious rock formations near the surface. The pit latrinesaddressed in this chapter include the cat hole,  cross tree, straddle tree, deep pit, and bore holelatrines. Alternatives to pit latrines are available for locations where a high groundwater table or arock formation near the surface  prevents digging a pit of adequate  depth. They will be addressedlater in this chapter. 6.4.2.1.1.  Cat Hole Latrine. The simplest of all  pit latrines and fiel d human waste disposaldevices is the cat hole latrine (see Figure 6.2.). This latrine is used by individuals on the move148AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008or when on patrol (if individual waste collection bags are not available) and is covered imme-diately after use. It is also used in situations where latrine facilities are not available. As indi-cated in the drawing, a cat hole latrine should be dug at least 1 foot wide and 1 foot deep. Afteruse, replace and repack the removed soil. Figure 6.2.  Cat Hole Latrine. 6.4.2.1.2.  Cross Tree Latrine. Another very basic latrine is  the cross tree type (see  Figure6.3.). One latrine will usually se rve the needs of 6 to 8 personne l. As might be expected, thelatrine is situated downwind  from the beddown area, but not so  far from the shelters as toencourage individuals to break sanitary dis cipline. In areas where it is dif ficult to dig a pit,ration boxes or similar material should be used to collect waste. A urinal, designated for eachshelter, should also be located within 4 to 5 mete rs (4 to 5 yards) of th e shelter. Urinal varia-tions are provided elsewhere in this chapte r. A windbreak of boughs, tarpaulins, ponchos, orsnow wall can be constructed to provide both privacy and protect the latrine from the wind. Figure 6.3.  Cross Tree Latrine. 6.4.2.1.3.  Straddle Trench Latrine. The most common type of latrine for temporary (one tothree days) beddowns is the straddle trench or straddle pit latrine (see Figure 6.4.). A straddletrench latrine is usually dug 1 foot wide, 2 1/2 feet deep, and 4 feet long. In this configuration,it will accommodate two people at the same time. Provide straddle trenches to serve at least 4AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008149percent of the unit's male strength and 6 percent of the female strength. Thus, for a unit of 100men and 100 women, at least four latrines are needed for the men and six for the women. Placethe trenches at least 2 feet apart. As shown in the drawing, there are no seats with this type oflatrine. Instead, boards may be placed along both sides of the trench to provide better footing.Place toilet paper on a su itable holder and protect it from bad weather wi th a tin can or othercovering. Remove the earth and pile it at the end of the trench so that each individual can prop-erly cover his excreta and toilet paper. Figure 6.4.  Typical Straddle Trench Latrine. 6.4.2.1.4.  Deep Pit Latrine. The deep pit latrine is used f or longer periods of time and inbuilt-up areas. As shown in Figure 6.5., it is used with a latrine box. The standard latrine boxhas four seats and is 8 feet long and 2 1/2 feet wide at the base. A unit of 100 men requires twofour-seat latrine boxes. Cover th e holes with fly-proof, self-clo sing lids. Fly proof the crackswith strips of wood or tin. Place a metal deflector (can be made with a flattened can) inside thefront of the box to prevent urine from soaking into the wood. 6.4.2.1.4.1.  Dig the pit about 2 feet wide and 7 1/2 feet long. This will give the latrine box3 inches of support on all si des. The depth of the pit depe nds on the estimated length oftime the latrine is to be us ed. As a rough guide, allow a dept h of 1 foot for each week ofestimated use, plus 1 foot for the dirt cover when closed. Rock or high groundwater levelsoften limit the depth of the pit, but it should  be no deeper than  6 feet. Support may beneeded in some types of soil to prevent the  sides from collapsing. If so, use planking or asimilar material. Pack the ear th tightly around the bottom ed ges of the box to seal anyopenings through which flies might enter. Note: If the ground is too hard for digging or ifthe water table is too high, use a pail latrine or a burnout latrine instead. Both are describedelsewhere in this chapter. 6.4.2.1.4.2.  To prevent flies from breeding and to reduce odors, keep the latrine box clean,the seat lids closed, and the cracks sealed. Maintain a good fly control program in the area.Applying lime to the pi t contents or burning  it does not effectively control flies or odor.The box and latrine seats should be scrubbed with soap and water daily. 150AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 6.5.  Deep Pit Latrine. 6.4.2.1.5.  Portable Latrines. The portable latrine uses a latr ine box similar to the deep pitlatrine except the latrine box is built inside a portable structure that offers limited privacy andprotection from the elements. If prepackaged deployable sanitation assets are delayed during asizeable deployment or beddown activity; this  more substantial portable latrine may servelarge groups better than some of the other expedient options discussed in this chapter. Portablelatrines vary; however, all are built on the same  basic precepts of mobility, adequate ventila-tion, proper sanitation, and reasonable privacy. Once the supporting pit is filled, the latrine issimply relocated to another spot, usually in the same vicinity, and the old pit is then filled andclosed as discussed previously. Figure 6.6. shows an example of this type of facility. Figure 6.6.  Portable Latrines. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 20081516.4.2.1.6.  Bored Hole Latrine. A bored hole latrine consists of a hole that is about 18 inchesin diameter and 15 to 20 feet deep. As indicated in Figure 6.7., a one-hole latrine box coversit. The actual diameter is not cr itical, so make it as lar ge as available augers permit. Removeboth ends of a metal drum and sink it into the ground to serve as a box. Make a fly-proof seatcover with a self-closing lid to fit the  top of the drum. If a drum is no t available, construct afly-proof, wooden box that is 18 inches high. A  bored hole latrine is sa tisfactory for smallunits. 6.4.2.2.  Expedient Latrines in High Groundwater Areas. Latrines should not be dug belowthe groundwater table or where they may drain into a water source. The groundwater table can bedetermined from information give n by local inhabitants or excavating to the groundwater table.The latrines described below are normally used where the groundwater table is high and ground-water contamination or water sta nding in the latrine pit  is probable. They are also ideal when animpervious rock formation is close to the surface, preventing adequate dispersal of liquids. 6.4.2.2.1.  Mound Latrine. A dirt mound makes it possible to build a deep-pit latrine withoutthe pit extending into water or rock. Construct a mound of earth that is at least 6 feet wide and12 feet long. It  must be able to suppor t a four-hole latrine box. The mound sh ould be highenough to meet the pit's depth requirement. Allow 1-foot from the base of the pit to the wateror rock level. Break up or plow the area where  it is to be placed to aid in seepage of liquidsfrom the pit. If timber is available, build a crib of desired height to enclose the pit and supportthe latrine box. Build the mound and compact it in successive l-foot layers to the top of the cribas shown in Figure 6.8. Roughen the surface of each layer before adding the next. If timber fora crib is unavailable, construct  the mound to the desired height  in l-foot layers, as describedand dig the pit into the mound.  If necessary, brace the walls w ith wood, sandbags, or othermaterial to prevent them from collapsing. Fly proof and enclose a mound latrine as describedin paragraph 6.4.1.1. Note: The size of the mound base depends on the type of soil in the area.Make the mound larger if the slope is steep. Also, it may be necessary to build steps up a steepslope. Figure 6.7.  Bored Hole Latrine. 152Figure 6.8.  Mound Latrine. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 20086.4.2.2.2.  Burn Out Latrine. A burn out latrine (Figure 6.9.) is particularly suitable for jun-gle areas with high groundwater tables. It has also been extremely useful in the past in desertregions where an impervious  rock layer lay a short distan ce under the sand. When using thistechnique, ensure the burning location is downw ind of the base camp. For a unit of 100 menand 100 women, at least eight men's latrines and eight women's latrines are needed. As shownin Figure 6.10., construct a burn out latrine by first  placing a 55-gallon drum in the ground.Leave enough of the drum above the ground for a comfortable sitting height. The drum may becut in half, making two latrines  of less capacity. Place a wooden seat with a fly-proof,self-closing lid on top of the drum. Weld handles to the sides of the drum, allowing two men tocarry it with ease, because drums must be moved before the contents are burned. Have two setsof drums, if possible, so one set can be used while the other set is being burned out. Encouragemale personnel to urinate in a urine disposal  facility rather than a burn  out latrine becausemore fuel is required to clean a latrine with a  liquid content. Burn the contents of each drumdaily by adding sufficient fuel to incinerate the fecal matter (Figure 6.11.). Do not use highlyvolatile fuel because of its explosive nature. A mixture of 1 quart of gasoline to 5 quarts of die-sel oil is effective; nevertheless, use it with caution. Burn the contents again if they are not ren-dered dry and odorless  in one effort. Bury the residual  ash once the bu rning process iscomplete. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008153Figure 6.9.  Multiple-Station Burn Out Latrines. Figure 6.10.  Burn Out Latrine Details. 154AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 6.11.  Performing Daily Burn Out Latrine Functions. 6.4.2.2.3.  Pail Latrine . Build a pail latrine when conditions  (populated areas, rocky soil,marshes) are such that a latrine cannot be  dug. Construct a standard latrine bo x according toparagraph 6.4.2.1.4. Also add a floor and place a pail  under each seat. Place hinged doors onthe rear of the box (see Figure 6.12.) to facilitate removal of pails when emptying. Position thebox to form a part of the outer wall (if the box is located in a building) while ensuring that therear of the box opens directly to the outside of the building. The box should be fly proof, andthe seats and rear doors should be self-closing. Construct the floor of the box with an impervi-ous material (concrete if possible) and allow en ough slope toward the rear to facilitate rapiddrainage of washing water. Clean pails at least once daily and bury, burn, or dispose of the con-tents by another sanitary method. Plastic liners for the pails reduce the risk of accidental spill-age. Tie the filled bags at the top before disposal. Figure 6.12.  Typical Pail Latrines. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 20081556.4.2.3.  Alternate Latrine Options. During certain contingencies, a lack of resources may makeit difficult to build one of the  aforementioned latrines. In such situations , the makeshift toiletdescribed below may serve as a temporary soluti on. In contrast, where t ime and resources areplentiful, it may be worthw hile to construct mobile  latrines ahead of an anticipated populationincrease. These options address both ends of the spectrum—from rudimentary to a cut above sim-ple functionality. Both have their place during the right situation. 6.4.2.3.1.  Makeshift Toilet. During an emergency or during  field activities where digging acat hole latrine is not an option, an expedient toilet can be made using a common water bucket.Simply line a bucket with a garbage bag and make a toilet seat out of two boards placed paral-lel to each other acros s the bucket. After each  use, pour a disinfectant such as bleach (1  partliquid chlorine bleach to 10 parts water) into the garbage bag to help avoid infection and stopthe spread of disease. Cover the bucket tightly when it is not in use. Bury garbage and humanwaste to avoid the spread of di sease by rats, insects, and other  vectors. Dig a pit two to threefeet deep and at least 50 feet downhill or away from any well, spring, or water supply. 6.4.2.3.2.  Personal Toilets. During very short deployments or during special operations, indi-viduals may be provided personal chemical toilets (Figure 6.13.). Also, when on a march, per-sonal disposal bags should  be used first, if available. If not available, personal cat holes areanother option. Always dispose of waste immedi ately to prevent flie s from spreading germsfrom waste to food or water supplies. Disposin g of waste a lso helps keep unwanted animalsout of the beddown area. Figure 6.13.  Typical Personal Chemical Toilets. 6.5.  Urinals. In permanent and semi-permanent camps, urine disposal facilities are usually connected tothe sewer system. However, in the field, separate devices for urine dis posal are often necessary. At leastone urine disposal facility is required for each male latrine or per 100 personnel. Following are examplesof some of the more common expedient field devices used for the disposition of urine and their applicablemaintenance procedures. As a general  rule, urinals should always be situat ed either in or very near malelatrines. This avoids undesirable soiling of the latrine seats and immediate area. 6.5.1.  Urine Soakage Pit. One of the best devices for urine disposal in the field is a urine soakage pit(see Figure 6.14.). Begin construction of this item by digging a pit 4 feet square and 4 feet deep. Next,fill it with an aggregate material and lay a border along each edge so that each side of the soakage pit'ssurface is 5 feet long. Ideally the  border should be 6 inches wide,  4 inches deep,  and composed of156AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008small stones. Depending on available materials, use either pipe urinals or trough urinals with this pit.An optional feature is the ventilat ing shafts with screened openings  that extend from about 8 inchesabove the pit to within 6 inches of the bottom of the pit. As shown in Figure 6.14., pipe urinals shouldbe at least 1 inch in diameter and installed at an angle near each corner of the pit or, if needed, on thesides halfway between the corners. The pipes should extend at least 8 inches below the surface of thepit. Place a funnel made of tarpaper, sheet metal, or similar material in the top of each pipe. The upperrim of the funnel s hould extend about 30 inches  above the ground surface.  For fly control and as asound sanitation practice, if tarpaper funnels are used, fill the funnels with straw and replace them ona daily basis. Note: A soakage trench (see paragraph 6.5.4.) may be used when the groundwater tableor a rock formation precludes digging a standard urine soakage pit. 6.5.2.  Trough Urinal. If materials are available  and more permanent facil ities are desired, build atrough urinal as shown in  Figure 6.15.. The trough is U- or V -shaped and made of sheet metal orwood. If it is co nstructed of wood, line it  with heavy tarpaper. The four troughs forming the sidesshould be no m ore than 4 1/2 f eet long when t hey are used with  a soakage pit and an apron. Eachtrough should slope slightly toward one corner wher e a pipe carries the urine to the soakage pit.Another expedient urinal variation is shown in Figure 6.16. Figure 6.14.  Typical Urine Soakage Pit. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 6.15.  Common Trough Urinal. 157Figure 6.16.  Trough Urinal Variation. 6.5.3.  Urinoil. The urinoil represents a further modification for more permanent installation (Figure6.17.). In its simplest form, an urinoil is a 55-gallon drum containing oil that is placed over a recessedsoakage pit, thus the name, urin oil. Waste POL can be used; but vegetable oil is preferred. Urinevoided through the screen immediately sinks through the oil to the bottom of the drum. The action of158AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008the urinal is somewhat like that of a barometer. As more urine is added, the oil level rises in the 3-inchpipe. This continues until it  reaches the 1 1/2-inch no tch on the overflow pipe  in the center of thedrum. Atmospheric pressure and the weight of the oil cause the urine to overflow until equilibrium isreestablished in the drum. The oil al so acts as an effective seal against odors and flies. The screen iseasily lifted with attached hooks fo r removal of debris. To initiate the operation of the urinoil, placethe prepared drum in pos ition on the soakage pit a nd tamp the ground around  the drum to the levelshown in the drawing. Next, pour at least one foot of water into the drum. Lastly, add waste oil (about32 gallons) until the oil reaches the point indicated in the graphic. The urinoil is now ready for use andwill remain functional as long as the soakage pit will accept urine. 6.5.4.  Soakage Trench. Use a soakage trench ( Figure 6.18.) when the groundwater level or a rockformation precludes digging a soakage pit. The trench consists of a pit, 4 feet square and l foot deep.The pit has a trench radiating outward from each side for a distance of 6 or more feet. Dig the trenches1 foot wide, varying the depth from 1 foot at the center to 1 1/2 feet at the outer ends. Fill the pit andtrenches with material similar to that used in the soakage pit. 6.5.5.  Maintenance of Urine Disposal Facilities. Proper maintenance of urinal facilities consists ofthe steps in Table 6.1. Figure 6.17.  Basic Urinoil Details. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 6.18.  Soakage Trench. 159Table 6.1.  Urinal Maintenance. Urinal Maintenance Step 1 For proper operation and sanitary purposes, individuals must urinate in the trough or the pipe, not directly on the pit's surface. Step 2  Wash funnels and troughs with soap and water daily. Step 3 Step 4 Replace funnels when necessary.  Prevent oil or greas e from getting in to the pit to prevent clogging.  Oilleeching through the pit may also contaminate the groundwater.  If the latrine is located some di stance from sleeping areas, place a lar gecan or pail at a convenient location for use as a urinal at night.  Empty thecan into the trough, pipe, or soakage  trench every morning, and wash thepail with soap and water before reusing it. Step 5 Step 6  When a urine soakage pit is abandoned or becomes clogged, spray it withinsecticide.  Mound it over with a l -foot covering of compacted earth andplace a rectangular sign on the mound indicating the type of pit and date ofclosure. 6.6.  Expedient Hand-Washing Devices. Simple hand-washing devices must be available at field latrinelocations. These devices should be easy to operate a nd have a constant supply of water . As previouslymentioned, the importance of hand-washing devices must be given a ggressive emphasis, because handscontaminated with fecal material are a common means of disease transmission. An expedient hand-wash-ing device is shown in Figure 6.19. 160AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 6.19.  Expedient Hand Washing Device. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008161Chapter 7  CONSTRUCTING EXPEDIENT SOIL BERMS AND DIKES 7.1.  Introduction. In today’s high-tech engineering environment, low-tech engineering solutions aresometimes the best way to satisfy certain expedient field construction requirements. A prime example isthe building of berms and dikes. In  addition to force prot ection requirements, engineers are frequentlytasked to build earthen berms for landfills, hazardous materials, burn pits, aircraft engine blast and noiseabatement, and other expeditionary activities. Dikes are often constructed for spill control, flood control,and basic water management operations. Both berms  and dikes have been around for centuries and liketoday, ancient engineers also used these methods for fortification and water management. The simplicityof design, ease of constructi on, and effectiveness ensure berms and di kes will continue to be a valuableengineering solution in the future. 7.2.  Overview. This chapter reviews expedient field construction procedures for soil berms and dikesand highlights how these applications are used to s atisfy specific engineering challenges. There are sev-eral definitions for berms. Many are described as a raised barrier or bank of earth that separates two areas(see Figure 7.1.). Conversely, dikes are often depicted a s a ditch or channel or as a raised barrier thatencloses an area. Each of these berm and dike applications will be addressed in this chapter. Figure 7.1.  Berm Construction During Desert Operations. 7.3.  Soil Berms. In an expeditionary field environment, soil berms are constructed around different sitesand facilities for a variety of reas ons. They can be emp loyed as either freestanding structures or builtagainst building exterior walls and retaining walls. Freestanding berms typically require more soil androom to construct than other berms; however, they are very effective when employed in applications suchas burn pits, landfills, and hazardous material storage. 7.3.1.  General Construction Requirements. Due to their size, most berm construction usuallyinvolves the use of heavy construction equipment. Typically, the berms are built of compacted soil andmust be designed to contend with th e ever-present effects of gravity. If the sides of a berm are toosteeply sloped, the soil will shift. Because of this, th e base of berms is often  at least three times  the162AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008width at the top. Figure 7.2. shows some general berm construction requirements. The top of a bermshould have a 10-to-1 slope to minimize water ponding on the crest and subsequently soaking into thestructure's interior. Also, once built, the sides of earthen berms shoul d be faced to control erosion. Avariety of face-sealing methods are available to meet this purpose. Sod and polyethylene are two com-mon methods. Other construction gu idelines and factors  are explained in the  following paragraphs.Table 7.1. provides labor comparisons for construction  of soil berms and other  types of revetments.As can be seen, berms are generally  less labor intensive and quicker  to build than some of the morecommon revetment materials—particularly sandbag protective structures. Figure 7.2.  General Berm Construction Factors. 7.3.2.  Berm Base Dimensions and Slope Angle. For general planning purposes, expect to make thebase of a freestanding berm three times its height. However, if time is available, a more detailed anal-ysis may be in order. Simply put, the allowable side slope of the berm face coupled with the width ofthe berm crest determines the width of the berm base. In practice,  for expedient situations, the maxi-mum realistic slope is the natural angle of repose of the soil. The lesser the slope, the greater berm sta-bility during inclement weather. For cohesionless soils (those composed primarily of sand), the slopeangle can be taken as the angle of internal friction. Table 7.2. gives friction angles for a range of soiltypes. However, if the soil type is unknown or time is not avai lable to conduct proper compaction, itis generally conservative to use  a 1-to-2 slope for preliminary desi gn and planning purposes. Forcohesive soils, greater slopes can typically be sustained. If time permits perform a slope failure analy-sis as described in standard soil mechanics texts or handbooks.

Other Consequential Factors. Other factors that must be taken into account when planning toconstruct any type of berm are soil composition,  moisture content retention, proper drainage, andcompaction requirements (see Table 7.3.). 164AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Table 7.3.  Other Construction Factors. Soil Composition Factors: A number of soil composition factors directly impact the performance of any earthen structure.  In fact,the soil consistency of a berm has  a direct relation to its stability an d performance.  In general, soil isprimarily composed of sand or clay.  There are also sandy loams and clay loams, but those are normallyrestricted to the relatively thin top layer of earth known as topsoil. Moisture Content: As addressed earlier in th e chapter, it is very important  that adequate measures be taken to seal theexterior of the structure at beddown locations where the annual precipitation level is high.   Proper Drainage: Drainage should always be a prime consideration when constructing any earth berm.  Poor drainage canrapidly undo all the hard work involved in building the structure.  If the berm is to be built in a region ofhigh rainfall, consider installing an  interior drainage tile to remove  moisture that may seep into thestructure's encasement. Compaction Requirements: Proper compaction is an essential  part of berm c onstruction, regardless of the type  of berm or soilinvolved.  Basically, berm material is compacted to increase i ts density—greater density increasesstability and performance.  Berm compaction is done in layers, and the extent is dictated by both the soiltype and its moisture content.  Usually, compactions will occur after every 6-to-12-inch layer of materialhas been placed.  Compaction can  be accomplished using a hand tamp, portable vibratory tamper , orpneumatic plate.  Heavy equipment (dozers/loaders) can compact in layers if tampers and rollers are notreadily available.  The hand tamp approach ( Figure 7.3.) is a slow, labor-intensive process, but itssimplicity means that it shoul d always be available.  Th e portable vibratory tamper ( Figure 7.4.) is amotorized hand-controlled tool ab out the size of a common house hold lawn mower.  The pneumaticplate is an excavator attachment and is one of the fastest methods  available.  A vibratory roller (Figure7.5.) may also be used where construction of very large berms is involved. Figure 7.3.  Airman Using Portable Hand Tamp. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008165Figure 7.4.  Portable Vibratory Compactors. Figure 7.5.  Vibratory Roller. 7.3.4.  Negative Aspects of Soil Berms. Soil berms offer simple and effective engineering solutionsto several field construction requirements. Soil berms also have nega tive aspects, especially from anexpediency approach. The principl e disadvantage associated with us ing berms is their lar ge spacerequirements. Soil berms may not be a practical solution in very rocky terrain or where grading equip-ment is not available. Heavy equi pment availability is an  absolute necessity. Berms sited near taxi-ways and runways may increase problems related to blowing dust and debris. Arid locations, such asdesert beddown sites, are particularly susceptible to this predicament.  At such site s, erosion controlmeasures are of particular  importance. In areas wh ere there is a lar ge amount of rainfall, berms willrequire frequent maintenance, particularly if the si des and crest are not waterproofed, covered withsod, or otherwise adequately stabilized. If berms use sod as protective cover, slope angles steeper than1 foot vertical to 3 foot horizontal (1V:3H) could make mowing grass difficult. 7.3.5.  Slope Protection for Soil Berms. Many different types of slope protec tion have be enemployed to counter the effects of soil berm erosion. Techniques such as grass or vegetation, gravel,sand-asphalt paving, concrete paving, articulated concrete mats, ri prap or rock blankets, and severaldifferent types of geotexti le material have been  used depending on  the level of protection needed.However, in an expeditionary environment where time and resources are generally limited, techniquessuch as riprap, articulated mats, or paving may be avoided if high-class slope protection is not needed.Grass, geocells, or other geotex tile protection methods may provi de lower-class slope protection166AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008options, if necessary. Table 7.4. addresses the function or  suitability of grass and geocells as slopeprotection. Slope protection for soil berms utilized  as containment dikes and levees requires specialconsideration. Review paragraph 7.4.2. for information on dike and levee construction. Table 7.4.  Berm Slope Protection. Type Grass or Vegetation Geocells BERM SLOPE PROTECTION COVERS Function or Suitability  •    Counteracts soil movement down the slope and erosion from rainfall  •    Reinforces soil by providing network of roots that resist soil shearing   •    Permits excess water to drain from the slope  •    Limits soil movement down the slope  •    Soil confinement system that stabilizes soil berm fill material through use of       cells or grids 7.3.6.  Berm Applications.  7.3.6.1.  Burn Pits. Burn pits are normally constructed to  dispose of solid waste and hazardouswaste materials. Burn pits at beddown locations will often be coll ocated with the base controlledwaste disposal area. Burn pits are normally located far away from the main part of the installationto minimized personnel exposure to smoke and alleviate any impact on airfield operations causedby burning waste. As an added sa fety measure, a soil or earthen  berm (usually 15’-20’ high) isplaced around the burn  pit. Although berms for burn pits  are constructed like other expedientberms, sometimes other features are incorporated into the design and constr uction of the pit. Forexample, dirt ramps may be added to allow acce ss by dozers and compactors to perfo rm routinemaintenance on the pit. The size of the pit (and berm) is dictated by the amount of solid waste thatneeds to be burned in the pit. The height of the berm is also determined by factors at the beddownlocation. Factors such as groundwater table, pi t design (above or below ground, loading ramps),maintenance equipment, personnel safety, etc., may affect how high the berm is built. Figure 7.6.is one example of a burn pit that utilizes a soil berm. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008167Figure 7.6.  Typical Burn Pit Surrounded by a Soil Berm. 7.3.6.2.  Landfills, Hazardous Material Storage Areas, Airfields, and Firing Ranges. Otherthan for force protection, freestanding soil  berms are normally employed around these types offacilities to limit a ccess, provide noise abatemen t, or provide a safety ba rrier. Regardless of thepurpose or location, the construction procedures for freestanding soil berms are basically the sameas those discussed in paragraph  7.3.1. However, engineers should  review and comply with ETL06-11: Small Arms Range Design and Construction, when constructing  soil berms for fi ringranges. 7.4.  Dikes. Dikes are generally constructed to support spill control measures or in response to floodwateremergencies and disasters. They cons ist of two basic featur es: either a raised embankment/barrier or adrainage ditch. The raised embankment is often constructed around fuel storage and distribution areas tolimit damage due to accidental spills. Raised embankments are used in conjunction with ditch construc-tion to hold back or drain floodwaters, respectively. 7.4.1.  Fuel Dikes. Fuel dikes are constructed around POL tanks and bladders (Figure 7.7.) as a forceprotection measure and to contain fuel spills if the tanks rupture or catch on fire. Although the primaryfocus of this section is to address expedient fuel dike construction, a brief description of site selectionand criteria is app ropriate. Engineers tasked to build  fuel dikes should work  closely with logistics(fuels) specialists responsible for the design and operation of the fuel distribution system. 168AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 7.7.  Dikes Placed Around Fuel Bladders. 7.4.1.1.  Site Criteria. Selected sites should be in non-conge sted areas where ot her facilities donot interfere with fuel operations. Avoid locating fuel dikes in drainage areas above critical instal-lations. Locate them in areas where a potential fuel fire will not spread down to other installationareas. The best sites are on flat ground in sloping terrain to allow for gravity flow to the issue sideor first pumping station. Beachh ead sites may be located in sa ndy seashore areas up from thebeachline (Figure 7.8.). Sites should also have adequate drainage. Preferably, the water tableshould be more than 6 feet b elow the surface. Avoid marshlands, riverbanks, or bottomland sub-ject to flooding and other sites with poor or undependabl drainage. Figure 7.8.  Cutting a Sand Dike for a Fuel Bladder. 7.4.1.2.  Fuel Dike Construction. When constructing a fuel dike,  the size or height should besuch that the volume of liquid in the fuel bladder can be contained within the dike should a ruptureoccur. Figure 7.9. and Figure 7.10. give examples of a typical fuel dike construction. When pre-paring the surface, clear the site  and grade about a 1 p ercent slope towards the issue side or tankdrain location. Inspect the ground and remove any rocks, sticks, or sharp objects that could punc-ture the bladder. Place a dike basin drain at the lowest end of the bladder pad. The drain is a pipe(2-inch diameter minimum) with a gate valve.  Place this pipe under th e dike construction. Thedike should extend about 1 foot above the fuel tank  and be at least 4 feet wide at the crown. Thewalkway area between the dike and the fuel bladder should be about 2 feet wide to allow for main-tenance. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 7.9.  Typical Fuel Dike. 169Figure 7.10.  Fuel Dike Cross Section. 7.4.1.2.1.  Dike  construction for fuel bladde rs should be const ructed to hold fuel a mountsslightly larger than bladder capacity. When constructing the dike, ensure the fuel trucks, fuel-ing and de-fueling, are able to travel over the ground adjacent to the dike. Keep in mind mostof the trucks weigh more than 80,000 lbs. Stabilize the travel area around the dike by 50 to 100feet to ease truck operations . If applicable, consid er civilian delivery truck weights and turnradiuses when sizing the truck travel area. 7.4.1.2.2.  Locations experiencing extreme heat for several months at a time will likely causebladder leaks. Fuel bladder kits contain liners  to hold spilled fuel if/when bladders burst orleak. Consider constructing secondary dikes outside of the prim ary dike to catch leakage andspillage of residual or accidental spills due to hose/coupling breaks (Figure 7.11.). The linersshould be long enough to cover the secondary dike. 170AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 7.11.  Illustration of Fuel Dike with Secondary Dike. 7.4.2.  Raised Flood Control Dikes. Raised flood control dikes, emba nkments, or barriers (oftenreferred to as levees) (Figure 7.12.) are typically constructed of soil and sandbags. However, sandbaglevees are not considered an expedient method because significant  time and personnel are needed tofill sandbags during an emergency (Figure 7.13.). In recent times, filled HESCO barriers have beenused in the construction  of expedient dike walls. S ince expedient dikes are constructed in an em er-gency, their primary purpose is to  provide flood protection for periods  of only a few days or weeks.More permanent dikes or levees require more planning, analysis, time, and materials to construct andcannot be considered expedient. Although there is typically very  little time to pr epare for an unfore-seen flood emergency, local emergency planners should address certain basics that engineers will needprior to dike construction. Issues such as the loca tion of earth borrow sites; heavy equipment routes;proposed alignment for dike, equipment and supplies, and other matters should be determined beforeconstruction of the dike begins. Figure 7.12.  Earthen Dike Being Constructed to Control Flood Waters. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008171Figure 7.13.  Personnel Constructing Sandbag Levee. 7.4.2.1.  General Construction Requirements. The design of raised flood control dikes or barri-ers is very similar to that of  freestanding soil berms discussed earlier;  however, they serve twovery different purposes. Flood control dikes are designed to hold back floodwaters, and their fail-ure could potentially result in devastation over a wide area a nd adversely affect many people.Raised dikes constructed during an emergency should be built to hold throughout the entire floodevent. Anytime there is  water against the embankm ent, there is a potential dang er that the dikecould fail. Therefore, even und er emergency situations, proven construction methods should beused when constructing raised  flood control dikes—an emergency is not the time to experiment.The standard design of a raised dike is generally dictated by the foundation soils and the materialsavailable for construction. Always attempt to make the dike  or embankment compatible with thefoundation. Information on foundation soils may be  available from local of ficials or engineers,and it should be utilized. Use  the information in paragraph  7.4.2.5. as a guide when determiningvertical and horizontal embankment design. Also keep in mind that a revised forecast may requireadditional fill to be placed. 7.4.2.2.  Alignment. Before heavy equipment operators can  begin moving earth to build a raiseddike, engineer planners must  establish an alignment for the  proposed barrier. The alignmentshould be the shortest route possible, provide  the maximum practical protection, and take advan-tage of any high ground where available. The flood  barrier should be kept as far landward of thebody of water as possible  to prevent encroachment on the fl oodway. Sharp bends should also beavoided. Keep as many trees and as much brush between the dike and the water as possible to helpdeflect water current and debris. The earth borrow  areas should have ade quate material for con-struction of the dike and must be accessible at all times. Also, the borrow area should be located inan area that will not become isolated from the dike project by high water. 7.4.2.3.  Foundation Preparation. Prior to constructing a rais ed embankment, the foundationarea along the levee alignment should be prepared. Trees should be cut and the stumps removed.All obstructions above th e ground surface should be  removed, if possible. This includes brush,structures, snags, and similar debris. In snow-c overed areas, push the snow riverward so as todecrease ponding when the snow melts. The foundation should then be stripped of topsoil and sur-face humus. Stripping may be impossible if the ground is froze n. In this case, the foundation172AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008should be ripped or scarified, if possible, to provide a rough surface for bonding with the embank-ment. Every effort should be made to remove all ice or soil containing ice. Frost or frozen groundcan also give a false sense of secu rity in the early stages of a fl ood fight. It can act as a rigidboundary and support the levee; but on thawing, soil strength may be reduced sufficiently to allowcracks or slides to develop. Frozen soil forms an impervious barrier to prevent seepage. This mayresult in a considerable buildup in pressure under the soils landward of the levee and, upon thaw-ing, pressure may be sufficient to cause sudden blowouts. If this condition exists, it must be mon-itored and one must be prepared to act quickly if  sliding or sand boils  develop. If stripping ispossible, the material should  be pushed landward and riverward of the toe of the levee.   Note:Clearing and grubbing, structure removal, and stripping should be performed only if time permits. 7.4.2.4.  Materials. Earth fill materials for emergency levees will usually come from local borrowareas. As previously mentioned, an attempt should be made to utilize materials which are compat-ible with the foundation materials as explained below. However, due to time limitation, any localmaterials may be used if re asonable construction procedures  are followed. The materials shouldnot contain large frozen pieces of earth. 7.4.2.4.1.  Clay. Clay is preferred because the section can be made smaller (steeper sideslopes). Also, clay is relatively impervious and has a relatively high resistance to erosion whenit is compacted. A disadvantage in using clay is that adequate compaction is difficult to obtainwithout proper equipment. Additi onally, the water content in impervious fill can impact thecompaction needs. Efforts are typically made at the borrow site  to obtain material with theoptimal moisture; otherwise, if that is not possible, more time may be required for compaction.Another disadvantage is that the clay may be  wet, and sub-freezing temperatures may causethe material to freeze in the  borrow pit and in the hauling eq uipment. Weather could causedelays and should definitely be considered in the overall construction effort. 7.4.2.4.2.  Sand. If sand is used, the section should comply as closely as possible with recom-mendations in paragraph  7.4.2.5.1. below. Flat slopes are important, as steep slopes withoutpoly coverage will cause seepage through the levee to outcrop high on the landward slope andmay cause the slope to slump. 7.4.2.4.3.  Silt. Material that is primarily  silt should be avoided, and  if it is used, poly facingmust be applied to the waterside slope. Silt , upon wetting, tends to collapse under its ownweight and is very susceptible to erosion. 7.4.2.5.  Design Considerations. As previously addressed, dike or levee designs are based on thesoil foundation and available construction materials. The three foundation conditions cited beloware classical and idealized, and usual field conditions depart from them to various degrees. How-ever, they should be used as a guide so that  possible serious flood fight  problems might be less-ened during high water. A top wi dth adequate for cons truction equipment will usually facilitateraising the embankment. Also, the  embankment height should be 2  feet higher than the forecastflood crest. Finally, actual embankment construction will, in most cases, depend on time, materi-als, and right-of-way available. 7.4.2.5.1.  Sand Foundation. If the foundation material under th e emergency dike is sand orsome other pervious material, the following guidance is provided. 7.4.2.5.1.1.  If the dike section is  to be made of sand, use a  minimum of 1V (Vertical) on3H (Horizontal) river slopes. A 1V on 4H river slope is preferable and will be less suscep-AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008173tible to erosion, but a 1V on 3H  slope is considered an adequate minimum for emergencypurposes. Use 1V on 5H for the landward slope and a 10-foot top width. 7.4.2.5.1.2.  If the dike section will be made of clay, use 1V on 2 1/2 H for both slopes. 1Von 3H slopes are preferable, but 1V on 1 1/2 H is an ac ceptable minimum for emergencypurposes. The bottom width should comply with soil creep ratio criteria; i.e., L (across bot-tom) should be equal to C x H; where C is  the foundation soil creep  ratio (i.e., 9 for finegravel and 15 for fine sand) and H is levee height. See  Table 7.5. below for various soilcreep ratios. Table 7.5.  Creep Ratios on Pervious Foundations. (Source: USACE EM 1110-2-1901) SOIL CREEP RATIO Soil Type Critical Creep Ratio Very Fine Sand or Silt Fine to Medium Sand Coarse Sand Fine Gravel or Sand and Gravel Coarse Gravel including Cobbles Very Hard Clay or Hardpan 18 15 12 9 3.0 1.6 7.4.2.5.2.  Clay Foundation. If the foundation material under the emergency levee is clay, thefollowing guidance is provided 7.4.2.5.2.1.  If the dike section is to be made of sand, it should be constructed with 1V on3H for the river slope. Again, a 1V on 4H is preferable, but the steeper slope is consideredadequate for emergency purposes. Use 1V on 5H for the landward slope and a 10-foot topwidth, as described in the previous section. 7.4.2.5.2.2.  If the dike section is  to be made of clay , use 1V on 2 1/2 H for both slopes.Slopes of 1V on 3H are preferable for clay levees, but 1V on 1 1/2 H is an acceptable min-imum for emergency purposes. With a clay foundation, there is no need to construct addi-tional berms. 7.4.2.5.3.  Clay Layer Over a Sand Foundation. If the foundation material is such that thereis an impervious clay layer resting over a pervious sand layer , the following guidance is pro-vided. 7.4.2.5.3.1.  If the dike section is  to be made of sand, use  a minimum of 1V on 3H riverslopes for emergency purposes. A 1V on 4H slope is preferable if this construction is pos-sible. Use 1V on 5H landward slope and 10-foot top width. In addition, a landside berm ofsufficient thickness may be ne cessary to prevent rupture of the clay lay er. The berm maybe constructed of sand, gravel, or clay, but since berms made of clay generally need to bewider and thicker than those made of pervious materials, it would probably reduce the con-struction effort to build the berm with sand or gravel if these materials are available. Stan-dard design of berms requires  considerable information and detailed analysis of soil174AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008conditions. Prior technical assistance may reduce berm constr uction requirements in anyemergency situation. 7.4.2.5.3.2.  If the dike section is  to be made of clay , use 1V on 2 1/2 H for both slopes.Again, 1V on 3H slopes are preferable, but 1V  on 1 1/2 H is an  acceptable minimum foremergency purposes. Additionally, a berm may be necessary to prevent rupture of theimpervious top stratum. 7.4.2.6.  Placement and Compaction. Obtaining proper compaction  equipment for a given soiltype will be dif ficult. In most cases, the on ly compaction may be fro m hauling and spreadingequipment; i.e., construction traffic routed over the fill. 7.4.2.7.  Slope Protection. Methods of protecting embankment sl opes from current scour, wavewash, seepage, and debris dama ge are numerous and varied. Du ring a flood emer gency, time,availability of materials, cost, and construction capability preclude the use of all accepted methodsof permanent slope protection. Field personnel must decide the type and extent of slope protectionthe emergency barrier will need. Several methods of protection exist which prove highly effectivein an emergency. Again, resourcefulness on the pa rt of the field personne l may be necessary forsuccess. 7.4.2.7.1.  Polyethylene and Sandbags. Experience has shown that a combination of polyeth-ylene (poly) and sandbags is one of the most expedient, effective, and economical methods ofcombating slope attack in a flood situation (Figure 7.14.). Poly and sandbags can be used in avariety of combinations. Time becomes the f actor that may determin e which combination touse. Ideally, poly and sandbag protection should be placed in the dry. However, many cases ofunexpected slope attack will occur during high  water. A method for  placement in the wet iscovered below. See Figure 7.15. to Figure 7.17. for suggested methods of laying poly andsandbags. Since each flood fight project is unique (river, personnel available, materials, etc.),specific details of pl acement and materials ha ndling will not be covere d. Personnel must beaware of resources available when using poly and sandbags. Figure 7.14.  Poly Sheeting and Sandbags Reduce Water Absorption. 7.4.2.7.1.1.  Toe Anchorage and Poly Placement. Anchoring the poly along the water-side toe is important for a successful job (see Figure 7.15.). This may be done three differ-ent ways: (1) After completion of the embankm ent, excavate a tren ch along the toe andAFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008175place poly inside the trench and backfill the trench; (2) Place poly flat-out away from thetoe and push earth over the flap ; and (3) Place poly flat-out  from the toe and place one ormore rows of sandbags over the flap. After anchoring the poly, unroll the poly up the slopeand over the top, leaving enough excess to  anchor with sandbags. The poly should beplaced from downstream to upstream along the slopes and overlapping at least 2 feet. Thepoly is now ready for the “hold down” sandbags. Figure 7.15.  Anchoring Polyethylene. 7.4.2.7.1.2.  Slope Anchorage. Poly placed on raised embankments should be held down.An effective method of anchoring poly is a grid system of sandbags (Figure 7.16.), unlessextremely high velocities of water, heavy debris, or a large amount of ice is anticipated. Inthat case, a solid blanket of  sandbags over the poly should be  used. A grid system can beconstructed faster and requires fewer bags and much less labor than a total covering. Vari-ous grid systems include ver tical rows of lapped bags, 2” x 4” lumber held down byattached bags, and rows of bags held by a c ontinuous rope tied to each bag. Poly can alsobe held down by a system usi ng two bags tied with rope a nd the rope sadd led over theembankment crown with a bag on each slope. 176AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 7.16.  Slope Protection. 7.4.2.7.1.3.  Placement in the Wet. In many situations during  high water, poly and sand-bags placed in the wet must provide the emergency protection. Wet placement may also berequired to replace or maintain damaged  poly or poly displaced by current action.  Figure7.17. shows a typica l section of e mbankment covered in the wet.  Sandbag anchors areformed at the bottom edge of the poly by bunching the poly around a fistful of sand or rockand tying the sandbags to this fist-sized ba ll. Counterweights consisting of two or moresandbags connected by a length of 1/4-inch rope are used to hold the center portion of thepoly down. The number of counterweights will depend on the uniformity of the levee slopeand current velocity. Placement of the poly consists of first casting out the poly sheet withthe bottom weights and then adding counterwe ights to slowly sink the poly sheet intoplace. The poly, in most cases , will continue to move down slope until the bottom edgereaches the toe of the slope. Suf ficient counterweights should be added to ensure that noair voids exist between the poly and the levee  face and to keep the poly from flapping orbeing carried away by the current. For this reason, it is important to have enough counter-weights prepared prior to the placement of the sheet. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008177Figure 7.17.  Placement of Polyethylene in the Wet. 7.4.2.7.1.4.  Overuse of Poly. In past floods, there has been a tendency to overuse and, insome cases, misuse poly on slopes. For example, on well compacted clay embankments inareas of relatively low velo cities, use of poly would be  unnecessary. Also, placement ofpoly on landward slopes to prevent seepage must not be done. It will only force seepage toanother exit and may prove detrimental. Poly has been used on the landside slope of leveesto prevent rainwater from entering a crack wh ere slope movement has occurred, particu-larly in fat clay soils. Keeping water out of  the cracks resulting from slope movements isdesirable to prevent lubrication and additional hydrostatic pressure on the slip surface. 7.4.2.7.2.  Riprap. Riprap is a positive means of providing slope protection (Figure 7.18.) andhas been used in a few cases where erosive forces were too large to effectively control by othermeans. Objections to using riprap when flood fighting are: (1) rather costly; (2) large amountnecessary to protect a given area; (3) availability; and (4) little control over its placement, par-ticularly in the wet. In situations when suitable rock is not available within economical haulingdistance, soil cement slope protection may be a viable option. 7.4.2.7.3.  Miscellaneous Measures. Several other methods of  slope protection have beenused. Small groins, extending 3.05 m (10 ft) or more into the channel were effective in deflect-ing current away from the levees. Log booms ha ve been used to protect levee slopes fromdebris or ice attack. Logs can  be cabled together and anchored  with a deadman in the levee.The boom will float out in the current and, depending on log size, will deflect floating objects.Straw bales pegged into  the slope may be successful against wave action as well as strawspread on the slope and overlain with snow fence. 178AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008Figure 7.18.  Placement of Riprap. 7.4.2.8.  Using Wire/Fabric Earth Filled Barriers. Earth filled barriers can be used for fast con-struction of a water dike  wall. The walls need to be reinfo rced on the opposite side (landside) ofthe water with earthen material filled with organic/rock mixture for strength. 7.4.3.  Drainage Ditches and Channels. As previously addressed, drainage ditches and channels arealso defined as a type of dike. They are used to control or enhance water runoff (Figure 7.19.) and areoften employed after a flood to handle unwanted surface water. Sometimes requests are made to locateirrigation and/or drainage ditches in close proximity to the landside levee toe. This could lead to seri-ous seepage and/or slope stability problems. Th e location and depth of proposed ditches should beestablished by seepage and stability analyses. This requires information on foundation soil conditions,river stages, and geometry of the  proposed ditch. Local engineers  should be consulted before con-structing drainage ditches, es pecially if raised levees are in the immediate area. See Chapter 2 formore information on expedient drainage construction measures. AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008179Figure 7.19.  Creating a Drainage Ditch to Enhance Water Runoff. 7.5.

Purpose. To provide guidance on use of epoxy injection to repair cracks in concrete. The followinginformation was extracted from Repair, Evaluation, Maintenance, and Rehabilitation (REMR) TechnicalNote CS-MR-3.9, Crack Repair Method: Epoxy Injection. A2.2.  Description. This method can be used to repair cracks as narrow as 0.002 inch. The method gener-ally consists of drilling holes at close intervals along the cracks, in some cases installing entry ports, andinjecting the epoxy under pressure. For massive structures, an alternative procedure consists of drilling aseries of holes, usually 7/8 inch in  diameter that intercepts the crack at a number of locations. Typically,holes are spaced at 5-foot intervals. A2.3.  Equipment, Tools, and Personnel Requirements. A concrete drill, an  epoxy injection system, ameans of cleaning holes and cracks, and normal hand tools are required. One man can repair cracks usingthis method, but a two- or three-man operation is more efficient. Epoxy injection requires personnel witha high degree of skill for satisfactory execution. A2.4.  Applications and Limitations. Epoxy injection has been successfully used in the repair of cracksin buildings, bridges, dams, and other types of concrete structures. However, unless the crack is dormant(or the cause of cracking is removed, thereby making the crack dormant), it will probably recur, possiblysomewhere else in the structure. If the crack is active and the desired is to seal it while allowing continuedmovement at that location, a sealant or other material that allows the crack to function as a joint must beused. The ambient temperature may  also limit application of this meth od. In the case of delaminatedbridge decks, epoxy injectio n can be an ef fective intermediate-term repair method. In this case, steps inparagraph A2.5.1., A2.5.2., and A2.5.6. outlined below are omitted. The proces s is terminated at a spe-cific location when epoxy exits from the crack at so me distance from the injection ports. This methoddoes not arrest ongoing corrosion. A2.5.  Step-By-Step Procedure.  A2.5.1.  Clean the cracks. Th e first step is to clean  cracks that have been  contaminated. Oil, grease,dirt, or fine particles of concrete prevent epoxy pe netration and bonding. Preferably, contaminationshould be removed by flushing with water or some  other especially effective solvent. The solvent isthen blown out using compressed air, or adequate time is provided for air-drying. A2.5.2.  Seal the surface. Surface cracks should be sealed to keep the epoxy from leaking out before ithas gelled. Where the crack face cannot be reac hed, but where there is backfill, or where aslab-ongrade is being repaired, the ba ckfill material or subbase material is often an adequate seal. Asurface can be sealed by brushing an epoxy along the surface of the crack and allowing it to harden. Ifextremely high injection pressures  are needed, the crack sh ould be cut out to a  depth of 1/2 in. andwidth of about 3/4 in. in a V-shape, filled with an epoxy, and struck off flush with the surface. If a per-manent glossy appearance along th e crack is objectionable and if  high injection pressure is notrequired, a strippable plastic may be applied along the crack. When the job is completed, the dry fillercan be stripped away to expose the gloss-free surface. A2.5.3.  Install the entry ports. Three methods are in general use: AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008189A2.5.3.1.  Drilled holes—fittings inserted. Historically, this method was the first to be used and isoften used in conjunction with V -grooving of the cracks. The method enta ils drilling a hole intothe crack, approximately 3/4 inch in diameter and  1/2 to 1 inch below the apex of the V -groovedsection, into which a f itting, such as a pipe ni pple or tire valve stem,  is bonded with an epoxyadhesive. A vacuum chuc k and bit are useful in preventing the cracks from being plugged withdrilling dust. A2.5.3.2.  Bonded flush fitting. When  the cracks are not V-grooved, a method frequently used toprovide an entry port is to bond a fitting flush with the concrete face over the crack. This flush fit-ting has a hat-like cross section with an opening at the top for the adhesive to enter. A2.5.3.3.  Interruption in seal. Another means of providing entry is to omit the seal from a portionof the crack. This method can be  used when special gasket devices  are available that cover theunsealed portion of the crack and al low injection of the adhesive directly into the crack withoutleaking. A2.5.4.  Mix the epoxy . This is done either by ba tch or continuous methods . In batch mixing, theadhesive components are premixed according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually with the useof a mechanical stirrer, like a paint mixing paddle. Care must be taken to mix only the amount of adhe-sive that can be used pr ior to commencement of gelling of the  material. When the adhesive materialbegins to gel, its flow characteristics begin to change, and pressure injection becomes more and moredifficult. In the continuous mixing system, the two liquid adhesive components pass through meteringand driving pumps prior to passing through an automatic mixing head. The continuous mixing systemallows the use of fast-setting adhesives that have a short working life. A2.5.5.  Inject the epoxy. A2.5.5.1.  Hydraulic pumps, paint pressure pots,  or air-actuated caulking guns can be used. Thepressure used for injection must be carefully selected. Increased pressure often does little to accel-erate the rate of injection. In fact, the use of excessive pressure can propagate the existing cracks,causing additional damage. A2.5.5.2.  If the crack is vertical, the injection process should begin with pumping epoxy into theentry port at the lowest elevation until the e poxy level reaches the entry port above. The lowerinjection port is then capped, and the process is re peated at successively higher ports until thecrack has been completely filled and all ports have been capped. A2.5.5.3.  For horizontal cracks, injection should proceed from one end of the crack to the other inthe same manner. The crack is fu ll if the pressur e can be main tained. If the press ure cannot bemaintained, the epoxy is still flowing into unfilled portions or leaking out of the crack. A2.5.6.  Remove the surface seal. After the inje cted epoxy has cured, the surface seal should beremoved by grinding or other m eans, as appropriate. Fittings an d holes at entry ports should bepainted with an epoxy-patching compound. A2.6.  Environmental Considerations. Reasonable caution should guide the prepar ation, repair, andcleanup phases of any crack repair activities invol ving potentially hazardous and toxic chemical sub-stances. Manufacturer's recommendations to protect  occupational health and environmental qualityshould be carefully followed. In in stances where the ef fects of a ch emical substance on occupationa lhealth or environmental quality ar e unknown, chemical substa nces should be trea ted as potentially haz-ardous and toxic materials. 190AFPAM10-219V7   9 JUNE 2008A2.7.
