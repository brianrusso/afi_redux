Training  Objective.  This  instruction  prescribes  basic  policy  and  guidance  for  training United  States  Air  Force  KC-10  crewmembers  according  to  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1,  Aircrew Training. 1.1.1.  The  overall  objective  of  the  aircrew  training  program  is  to  develop  and  maintain  a high  state  of  mission  readiness  for  immediate  and  effective  employment  in  exercises, peacekeeping  operations,  contingencies,  and  war.   Mission  readiness  and  effective employment  are  achieved  through  the  development  and  mastery  of  core  competencies  for KC-10 crewmembers.  These core  competencies include the ability to  conduct  receiver and tanker AR, tactical ingress, tactical egress, tanker operations, instrument procedures, mission planning, ground operations, crew management and C4/AOC integration. 1.1.2.  This document also links AFTTP 3-3.KC-10, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals—KC-10, requirements into mission and continuation training tables while retaining a combat culture, leading edge technologies, and pushing capabilities while anticipating warfighter needs. 1.1.3.  The  secondary  objective  is  to  standardize  KC-10  training  requirements  into  a  single document  to  meet  requirements  for  a  basic  document  in  AFI  11-200,  Aircrew  Training, Standardization/Evaluation, and General Operations Structure. 1.1.4.  Throughout this document references are made to training requirements controlled by other  AFIs  and  provide  guidance  derived  from  those  AFIs.    The  controlling  AFI  may  be updated  after  the  publication  of  this  document,  so  it  is  necessary  to  refer  to  the  source document  AFI  for  current  guidance.    If  a  conflict  is  identified  for  a  training  requirement, comply with source document that establishes the training requirement. 1.2.  Key Words Explained. 1.2.1.  "Will" and "shall" indicate a mandatory requirement. 1.2.2.  "Should"  is  normally  used  to  indicate  a  preferred,  but  not  mandatory,  method  of accomplishment. 1.2.3.  "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.2.4.  "Note" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered essential to emphasize. 1.3.  Administration. 1.3.1.  Supplements.    This  AFI  is  a  basic  directive.    Each  MAJCOM  or  operational  theater may supplement this AFI.  MAJCOM supplements may be more, but not less restrictive than this instruction. 1.3.1.1.  MAJCOMs may set training requirements lower than specified in this instruction when the statement “or as specified in MAJCOM supplement” is indicated as applicable to  that  item  or  event.    MAJCOM  supplements  must  be  coordinated/approved  by AMC/A3T  and  AF/A3OI  IAW  AFPD  11-2,  and  AFI  11-202  Volume  1,  before AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 9 publication.  Units will send one copy of local supplement to the parent MAJCOM OPR.  (T-2) 1.3.2.  Local  Training  Guidance.    Units  may  supplement  this  instruction  and  will  submit  a copy  of  the  supplement  to  the  parent  MAJCOM  OPR  after  approval  by  the  OG/CC.    Air National Guard (ANG) is considered a MAJCOM for purposes of this instruction per AFI 11-202, Volume 1.  (T-2) 1.4.  Responsibilities.  AFI 11-202, Volume 1 outlines responsibilities for aircrew training.  See Chapter 6 for specific responsibilities related to the KC-10 Aircrew Training System (ATS). 1.4.1.  Lead Command.  Air Mobility Command (AMC) is designated lead command for the KC-10  Mission  Design  Series  (MDS)  as  specified  in  AFPD  10-9,  Lead  Command Designation  and  Responsibilities  for  Weapon  Systems,  AFPD  11-2,  and  AFPD  10-21,  Air Mobility  Lead  Command  Roles  and  Responsibilities.  The lead  command is  responsible for establishing and standardizing aircrew flying training requirements in coordination with user commands.    AMC/A3  delegates  to  AMC/A3T  the  authority  to  manage  all  training  course requirements,  training  tasks  and  Aircrew  Training  Systems  (ATS).    AMC/A3T  in coordination  with  user  commands  approves/fields  continuation  training  requirements  or adjustments,  and  short-notice  specialized  local  upgrade  courses  (e.g.,  FM  Immunity).  AMC/A3T is OPR for this AFI. 1.4.1.1.  Courses.    AMC/A3T,  in  coordination  with  user  commands,  approves  initial, mission  certification  and  continuation  training  requirements  and  fields  locally  taught upgrade courses. 1.4.1.2.  Realistic  Training  Review  Board  (RTRB).    AMC/A3T  will  host  a  RTRB biennially, or more frequently as required.  The RTRB reviews all training programs for currency, applicability, compliance and effectiveness.  Attendees should include training representatives  from  AMC/A3T/A3V/A3D,  USAF  Expeditionary  Center  (USAF EC)/WCOX, AFRC, curriculum developers, formal schools, selected unit representatives, and aircrew training system (ATS) contractors, as applicable. 1.4.1.3.  Detachment 1, Air Mobility Command Air Operations Squadron (AMCAOS): 1.4.1.3.1.  Aircrew Training Device (ATD) Certification.  Det 1 AMCAOS personnel will  conduct  a  semi-annual  Simulator  Certification  (SIMCERT)  on  all  ATDs according  to  AFI  36-2251,  Management  of  Air  Force  Training  Systems,  FAA  AC 120-40B,  Airplane  Simulator  Qualification,  FAA  AC  120-45A,  Airplane  Flight Training Device Qualification and, Aerial Refueling Airplane Simulator Qualification (ARASQ).  SIMCERT includes objective and subjective testing, inventory inspection, Quality  Assurance  Inspection  (QAI),  and  contract  compliance  evaluation.    The contractor  will  run  one  quarter  (1/4)  of  the  Qualification  Test  Guide  (QTG)  every three months based on actual aircraft data.  These tests will annotate Pass or Fail for each sub-test prior to semi-annual simulator certification.  Det 1 AMCAOS will use one simulator period to randomly sample 10% of the QTG.  This profile will be stated in the notification letter to the contractor. 1.4.1.3.1.1.  Flight  Training  Device  (FTD)  Certification.    The  FTD  is  tested  and certified  in  the  same  manner  as  the  simulator  except  where  the  fidelity  of  the device limits the tests.  The standards for these types of devices are derived from 10 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 FAA AC 120-45A. 1.4.1.3.1.2.  SIMCERT.    Notify  the  host  unit  45  days  in  advance  of  a  scheduled SIMCERT.    A  short-notice  SIMCERT  is  available  with  verbal  coordination between host unit, Det 1, AMCAOS, AMC/A3TK, ATS contractor, and the ATS contract management team.  Report SIMCERT results to AMC/A3TK and AFMC ASC/WNSPA. training  device  utilization,  availability,  and  ensure 1.4.1.3.1.3.

Det 1 will coordinate directly with the contractor when testing or familiarity training in the simulator is required.  The use of the simulator will be on a non-interference basis with contractor concurrence and Det 1 AMCAOS/CC approval. 1.4.1.3.2.  ATS  Courseware  Certification.   KC-10  courseware  development, revisions,  and  acceptance  are  tracked  by  a  mutually  accepted  process  between  the government  and  the  ATS  contractor.    This  process  is  to  review  and  approve  KC-10 courseware  for  timely  delivery,  accuracy,  and  compliance  with  the  KC-10 Instructional  Systems  Development  (ISD)  Management  Plan  and  USAF  courseware standards.    The  chief  of  courseware  or  appropriate  Det  1  courseware  representative will  issue  final  approval  for  the  government  after  the  training  media  is  ready  for implementation  at  the  training  sites.    Contractual  acceptance  for  the  government  is vested  in  the  KC-10  program’s  contracting  office  located  at  Wright-Patterson  AFB (ASC/WNSPA). 1.4.1.3.2.1.  Training  Systems  Configuration  Working  Group  (TSCWG)  will  be held  monthly  or  as  specified  by  the  ATS  contract,  and  attended  by  Det  1 SIMCERT  and  Courseware  representatives.    The  status  and  disposition  of  each courseware effort, whether in-scope, out-of-scope, late, or delayed will be briefed by  the  ATS  contractor  courseware  staff.   Det  1  AMCAOS  will  alert ASC/WNSPA  and  AMC/A3TK  of  any  discrepancies  that  cannot  be  resolved through Det 1 and contractor agreements. 1.4.1.3.2.2.  Det  1  AMCAOS  will  schedule  Subject  Matter  Experts  (SME)  for Technical  Interchange  Meetings  (TIM)  with  the  ATS  contractor.    Det  1 AMCAOS  will  also  schedule  crewmembers  (as  required  by  the  contractor)  to assist  in  courseware  development  including  Individual  Tryouts  (ITO)  and  Small Group Tryouts (SGTO). 1.4.1.3.3.  Contract  Compliance.    Det  1  AMCAOS  personnel  will  conduct  periodic Contract  Compliance  Evaluations  (CCE)  for  KC-10  ATS-supported  sites  and  report results to  AMC/A3TK and ATS contract  management.  Evaluation  personnel  assess ATS  contractor  performance  of  aircrew  ground  training  programs  to  include Computer-Based Training (CBT), simulator training, and facilities.  The KC-10 ATS site  and  Air  Force-Appointed  ATS  Contracting  Officer  Representative  (COR)  will receive  45-day  advance  notice  of  the  CCE  (non-interference  basis)  via  notification memo  or  email.    Unit  support  may  include  the  use  of  an  inbrief/outbrief  facility, AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 11 approximately 4-hours CBT time, and access to available crewmembers and staff for the purpose of conducting surveys and/or soliciting comments.  Units should consider the CCE a unit-level feedback tool to monitor quality of ATS ground training. 1.4.2.  Training  Command.    AMC/A3  is  responsible  for  formal  school  syllabi  and  is  the approval authority for any changes in coordination with lead and user commands according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1.  AMC/A3 designates AMC/A3T to oversee formal school courses and  syllabi  management  in  coordination  with  the  ATS  contractor  through  AMC/A3TK.

OG/CC  will  also  review  all  unit defined training “X” events for relevancy. 1.4.5.2.  ADSCs.    The  OG/CC  will  develop  and  maintain  procedures  with  their  local servicing  military  personnel  section  (MPS)  for  individual  crewmember  counseling  and personnel  system  updates  affecting  active  duty  service  commitment  (ADSC)  incurred with training specified in this AFI.  See AFI 11-202 Volume 1, AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service  Commitments  (ADSC),  and  Education  and  Training  Course  Announcements (ETCA) for more information. 1.4.5.3.  The  OG/CC  may  develop  additional  training  requirements  and/or  programs  as necessary  to  meet  unit  mission  requirements.    Include  such  requirements  in  local supplement. 1.4.5.4.  OG/CC  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  the  academic  training program  for  non-ATS  courses  (may  be  delegated  to  squadron  level).    The  OG  (or squadron) OPR will: 1.4.5.4.1.  Appoint  primary  and  alternate  instructors  for  each  non-ATS  course  to  be taught. 1.4.5.4.2.  Publish  a  ground  training  schedule  (AFRC  as  required)  to  include  date, time, location, instructor and designated crewmembers for each course (both ATS and non-ATS).  Include details in local supplement. 1.4.5.4.3.  Use MAJCOM, ATS, or unit-developed training products and/or syllabi for all courses, as applicable.  Units will reproduce courseware as applicable. 1.4.5.4.4.  Develop a procedure to monitor the academic training program for course content,  currency  of  materials,  instructor  availability,  and  status  of  training  aids.  Squadrons  should  recommend  to  the  commander  changes  to  existing  courses  or additional academic training courses required, based on crewmember feedback. 1.4.5.4.5.  Units will develop local procedures for scheduling ATS courses.  The unit training  manager  is  responsible  for  procedures  that  minimize  schedule  changes  and maximize  training  in  the  available  time.    Advise  ATS  contractor  for  scheduling changes and special training requirements. 1.4.5.4.6.  Send  recommendations  for  changes,  additions,  and  deletions  of  courses through  appropriate  channels  to  appropriate  MAJCOM  with  an  information  copy  to AMC/A3T. 1.4.5.5.  Instructor  Selection  and  Training.    OG/CC  (or  as  delegated/specified  in  local supplement)  will  select  course  instructors  (for  non-ATS  courses)  on  the  basis  of professional  qualification  and  aptitude  to  instruct  aircrew/students.    Local  academic instructor  program  will  follow  AFMAN  36-2236,  Guidebook  for  Air  Force  Instructors.  An individual instructor may receive course credit if instructing the class. AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 13 1.4.6.  Squadrons.  Sq/CC (or designated representative) will: 1.4.6.1.  Select  DOT Chiefs from the most highly qualified and experienced instructors.   Previous evaluator or FTU experience is highly desired. 1.4.6.2.  Ensure Sq/DOT is physically manned with a minimum of one instructor for each crew position.  Instructors should be selected based on experience, availability, and time on station (to ensure continuity of operations for each crew position in DOT). 1.4.6.3.  Convene a Squadron Training Review Panel (STRP) to be chaired by the Sq/CC and/or  Sq/DO.    Panel  members  should  include  squadron  representatives  from  training, Stan/Eval,  ADOs,  and  the  chief  from  each  crew  position.    Sq/CCs  should  utilize  the STRP  to  focus  training  objectives,  ensure  standards  are  being  met,  select  upgrade candidates, and ensure completion of required continuation training. 1.4.6.3.1.  STRP Requirements.  Squadrons will convene a STRP monthly (quarterly for  AFRC)  and  maintain  minutes  for  a  period  of  two  years.    STRP  minutes  will  be approved  by  the  Sq/CC    or  Sq/DO  and  may  be  produced/distributed/stored electronically by the Sq/DOT. 1.4.6.3.2.  STRP  Format.   The  STRP  should  review  staff  and  crewmember management  actions  necessary  to  complete  squadron  flight  and  ground  training programs.  The STRP will review the current status of aircrew training to ensure that current  training  objectives  are  being  met  and  that  those  individuals  selected  for upgrade training are the best candidates after reviewing their experience, proficiency level,  and  retainability.    To  accomplish  these  goals,  suggested  STRP  topics  include but  are  not  limited  to:    crew  position  gains/losses,  current  upgrade/requalification training (i.e., crewmembers in  an active training  status), recently  completed training (including  performance  during  training  and  current  certification  status),  future training  (individuals  already  approved  via  STRP),  upgrade  candidates,  current waivers, projected waivers, and continuation training status. 1.4.6.4.  Sq/CC  will  ensure  crewmembers  complete  in-unit  mission,  ground  and continuation training according to Table 1.2  Failure to reasonably progress may require action for removal. 1.4.6.5.  Before each semi-annual training period, the Sq/CC will assign FTLs and levels of qualification to assigned and attached crewmembers (see Chapter 4).  Use experience and aircraft proficiency as the basis of training level assignments. 1.4.6.6.  Sq/CC  (or  designated  representative)  will  ensure  formal  school  student  and supervisor  post-graduate  surveys  are  completed  via  the  KC-10  ATS  web  page.    The student  post-graduate  and  “Ops  Supervisor”  survey  will  be  completed  within  three months  after  scheduled  Phase  IB  graduation  date.    The  surveys  can  be  found  at www.kc10ats.com, click on “Graduate Survey”.  Contact AMC/A3TK (DSN 779-2553) for assistance. 1.4.6.6.1.  Sq/CC  (or  designated  representative)  will  periodically  review the “Graduate List” (that have not yet completed the Graduate Survey) for the appropriate location. 14 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 1.4.6.7.  Ensure  adequate  training  continuity  and  supervision  of  assigned  and  attached crewmembers.    Unit  commanders  may  assign  additional  requirements  based  on individual crewmember’s experience and proficiency. 1.4.6.8.  Sq/CC will review training and evaluation records of newly assigned or attached crewmembers  and  those  completing  formal  training  to  determine  the  necessary  training required  to  complete/certify  the  individual  as  Basic  Aircraft  Qualified  (BAQ),  Basic Mission  Capable  (BMC),  or  Mission Ready  (MR).    Document  this  review  on  AF  Form 4023, Aircrew Training Progress Report as “initial review.” 1.4.6.9.  Coordinate with the operations group in developing training programs. 1.4.6.10.  Review  qualifications  and  monitor  training  requirements  for  unit  assigned flight surgeons (FS). 1.4.6.11.  Execute unit-level aircrew certifications described in this instruction and local supplement. 1.4.6.12.  Ensure  flight  commanders  or  designated  squadron  representatives  monitor quality  of  training  being  accomplished  and  identify  training  deficiencies.    Squadron commanders must be advised of additional training needs. 1.4.6.13.  Ensure, to the  maximum  extent possible, that  flight training sorties (including those conducted when all Vol 1 training requirements for all crew positions have already been met) are required to meet aircrew, unit, or external user requirements. 1.4.7.  Formal  School  with  ATS  Contractor.    The  KC-10  ATS  contractor  is  responsible  for academic  and  aircrew  training  device  (ATD)  instruction  at  all  KC-10  training  sites.    This responsibility  includes  developing,  updating  and  publishing  courseware  and  the  formal school  syllabi  in  accordance  with  the  ATS  contract  and  published  syllabi  direction.    See Chapter 6 for additional ATS guidance. 1.4.8.  Formal School, Non-ATS.  See requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 1. 1.5.  Waiver Authority. 1.5.1.

It  is  essential  that  all  personnel  at  all  levels  prevent  the  misuse  of  air  mobility resources as well as the perception of their misuse when planning and executing local or off-station training missions. AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 17 1.6.1.2.  See  AMCI  11-208,  Tanker/Airlift  Operations,  for  off-station  training  flight requirements. 1.6.2.  Training  on  Operational  Missions.    Unless  specifically  prohibited  or  restricted  by weapon  system  operating  procedures  or  specific  theater  operations  order  (OPORD),  the OG/CC may  approve upgrade, qualification or special qualification/certification training on operational  missions.    See  passenger-carrying  restrictions  in  AFI  11-401  and  AFI  11-2KC-10, Volume 3, KC-10 Operations Procedures. 1.6.2.1.  Commanders will ensure the training will not impact mission effectiveness  and the  crewmember  receiving  training  is  under  the  supervision  of  an  instructor  of  like specialty.  In the event the mission changes and the training status may affect the ability of  the  crew  to  fly  the  mission,  the  instructor  will  ensure  coordination  between  OG/CC and 618 AOC (TACC) prior to accepting the mission. 1.6.3.  Unit  Commanders  will  utilize  aircrew  training  devices  (Weapons  Systems  Trainer (WST), Boom Operator Trainer (BOT), etc.) for continuation training to the maximum extent possible. 1.7.  In-Unit  Training  Time  Limitations.  Comply  with  the  time  limitations  in  Table  1.2  for mission  certification  training  (MCT)  and  in-unit  training.    Note:  for  Phase  IA  and  IB  time limitations  of  formal  KC-10  qualification,  upgrade,  and  requalification  courses  refer  to  Table A3.3.  Crewmembers entered in an in-unit training program leading to upgrade qualification (or requalification)  will  be  dedicated  to  that  program  on  a  full-time  basis  (i.e.  no  training  or  extra duties  that  do  not  directly  contribute  to  upgrade  certification).    Exception:    Supervisory personnel may continue their normal duties as time permits.  In-unit training will begin no later than 45 days (90 days AFRC) after reporting or being attached to a new duty station or unit. Table 1.2.  In-Unit Training Time Limitations.

MCT starts on the first duty day following the successful completion of a Phase IB evaluation.  Mission certification training events (ground and flight) may be accomplished concurrently with Phase IB training when deemed appropriate by the FTU Chief, squadron DO, or DOT. 2.  Not for Form 8 downgrades.  Additional training due to a Form 8 downgrade is set by AFI 11-202, Volume 2. 18 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 1.7.1.  Training Time.  Non-MCT training time start date is the date when the first significant training  event  (a  training  event  directly  contributing  to  qualification,  requalification,  or upgrade, e.g. Computer Based Training (CBT) lesson, Part Task Trainer (PTT), WST, Flight Training  Device  (FTD),  BOT,  Aircrew  System  Trainer  (AST),  ground  training,  flight training)  is  started  or  45  days  (90  days  AFRC)  after  being  attached  or  assigned  to  the  unit after completion of the formal school, whichever occurs first.  Voluntary self-study prior to course start date does not count as training time start date (see paragraph  2.2.2).  See Table 1.2, Note 1 for MCT training time.  Training time ends with the successful completion of one of  the  following  events:  flight  evaluation  (if  required  as  part  of  the  training  program), instructor validation of successful program completion (“sign-off”), or squadron commander certification (if required as part of the training program). 1.7.2.  For in-unit (not FTU) Phase I and MCT training, Sq/CC may extend training time up to  60  days  (120  days  ARC).    No  notification  to  MAJCOM/A3T  is  required  for  the  Sq/CC extension.  Extensions exceeding 60 days (120 days for AFRC) require MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent)  approval.    Units  will  notify  the  appropriate  MAJCOM/A3T  (or  equivalent)  via the waiver request procedures specified in paragraph 1.5.4, before the crewmember exceeds upgrade training time limits in Table 1.2.  Include training difficulty, unit corrective action to resolve and prevent recurrence, and estimated completion date in the waiver request.  (T-3) 1.8.  Training Documentation.  Units will use the AF Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew Qualification Worksheet as prescribed by AFI 11-202, Volume 1, to update aircrew certifications in  ARMS.    See  Chapter  7  for  specific  “Q”  codes.    See  Attachment  2  for  additional  training documentation requirements. 1.9.  Flight  Examiner  Usage.  Use  flight  examiners  as  instructors  for  any  phase  of  training  to capitalize  on  their  expertise  and  experience.    Units  may  use  flight  examiners  as  instructors  for qualification,  upgrade,  and  corrective  action  training.    If  an  examiner  is  used  as  a  primary instructor to train an individual, the same examiner will not administer the associated evaluation. 1.10.  Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements: 1.10.1.  All instructors should be MR (wing level and below). 1.10.2.  Instructor  candidates  who  previously  attended  a  formal  instructor  school  for instructor qualification and were qualified instructors in any US Air Force aircraft and who meet  the  minimum  flying  hour  requirements  may  upgrade  in-unit  with  OG/CC  approval.  Sq/CC will determine training required to complete the instructor upgrade in-unit, including evaluations IAW AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 2, KC-10 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.  (T-3) 1.10.3.  Formal  Training  Unit  (FTU)  Instructors.    Regular  Air  Force  (RegAF)  Operations Support  Squadrons  are  provided  with  staff  authorizations  (pilot,  flight  engineer,  and  boom operator)  over  and  above  the  crew  force.    Positions  are  allocated  per  AMC  manpower standard (AMCMS) to support initial qualification, requalification, upgrade, and continuation training  requirements  at  each  KC-10  main  operating  base  (MOB).    Personnel  assigned  to these positions must be very capable and highly experienced, both as instructors and KC-10 aircrew  members.    All  FTU  instructors  must  be  thoroughly  familiar  with  KC-10  course books,  training  requirements,  operational  techniques,  and  the  contractor  training  program.  Assigned  instructors  will  have  an  Associate’s  Degree  or  higher  within  one  year  of  being assigned to FTU instructor duty. AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 19 1.10.3.1.  Faculty Training Course (FTC).  The Faculty Training Course is  taught  at  the FTU  to  prepare  newly  assigned  instructors  for  schoolhouse  duties.    This  course  will  be locally  developed  and  updated  as  necessary.    All  instructors  conducting  initial qualification flying training should be graduates of FTC. 1.10.4.  Instructor  Supervision  Requirements. following personnel must be under the supervision of an instructor:   When  performing  aircrew  duties,  the 1.10.4.1.  All non-current crewmembers.  For non-current crewmembers, direct instructor supervision is required while performing the non-current event.  (See paragraph  4.9 for exceptions.) 1.10.4.2.  All  crewmembers  in  initial,  or  requalification  flying  training,  or  upgrade students flying an upgrade syllabus sortie as a student (see paragraph  1.10.4.5.2). 1.10.4.3.  Any other personnel designated by the Wg/CC, OG/CC, or Sq/CC. 1.10.4.4.  All unqualified or flying training level (FTL) “E” crewmembers require direct instructor supervision during critical phases of flight. 1.10.4.5.  Exceptions to paragraph  1.10.4 Instructor Supervision Requirements: 1.10.4.5.1.  Instructor supervision is not required for pilots certified by the Sq/CC to conduct receiver AR under the supervision of a Sq/CC certified Aircraft Commander. 1.10.4.5.2.  Flight  Engineer  and  Boom  Operator  students  in  instructor  upgrade training may fly, on a limited basis, without instructor supervision, as a crewmember in  their  previous  position  provided  they  are  current  and  qualified  in  that  position  in order to seat-fill  FTU sorties, as  required (i.e. a  current and qualified mission ready Flight Engineer (MF) in upgrade to IF may fly unsupervised as an MF).  If flying as an  FTU  student,  the  instructor  supervision  requirement  of    A3.1.1.1  applies  as  the member is now in a “student” status for upgrade to the next higher crew position. 1.10.4.5.3.  During FTU training, two Instructor Aircraft Commander (IAC) students (or one PCO student and one IAC student) may sit in the seat together for all events in which they are current and qualified. 1.10.4.5.4.  For  IAC  training,  selected  aircraft  events  (Formation  (F020),  AR Formation  (F060),  and  Tanker  AR,  Autopilot-off  (R080))  do  not  require  the  IAC student  to  be  at  a  set  of  controls;  the  IAC  student  must  demonstrate  the  ability  to instruct to a proficient level while the event is being accomplished.   1.10.4.5.5.  At a minimum, IP supervision is required for all tanker AR accomplished by  students  pursuing  qualification,  whether  in-unit  or  in  the  FTU,  who  are recommended for supervised AR. 1.11.  Distribution.  Units  will  establish  the  necessary  hard  copy  or  electronic  device distribution requirements of this AFI, as applicable. 1.12.  Transfer of Aircrews. 1.12.1.  When a crewmember transfers from one unit to another, the gaining unit will review, assess  and  assign  the  appropriate  FTL.    During  the  review,  the  gaining  unit  will  normally honor  the  losing  unit’s  assigned  training  level.    Certified/qualified  MR  crewmembers 20 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 transferring between units accomplish only unit-specific training and any applicable events in which they have lost currency.  See paragraph 3.3.5 and  3.4.2 for additional information in regards to transfer of aircrew members. 1.12.2.  For  Foreign  Military  Sales,  guest  pilots,  and/or  exchange  officers,  see  training requirements in  AFI 11-401.   Initial and/or continuation training requirements are specified in the appropriate MOU, OPLAN, or agreement and should mirror requirements of this AFI to the maximum extent possible. 1.13.  Aircrew Training While DNIF.  Crewmembers whose status is duty not including flying (DNIF) may log ground training events (including simulator) if the member's physical condition allows  it.    If  the  crewmember’s  ability  to  complete  training  is  in  question,  consult  the  flight surgeon  signing  the  AF  Form  1042,  Medical  Recommendations  for  Flying  or  Special Operational  Duty,  placing  the  crewmember  in  a  DNIF  status  IAW  AFI  48-123,  Volume  3, Medical Examinations and Standards, Flying and Special Operational Duty if the DNIF status includes ground training limitations. 1.14.  Aircrew Rated Management Overview. 1.14.1.  Programmed Flying Training (PFT).  AMC/A3T fulfills the training command’s role IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1.  A key product of this process is the PFT.  The PFT balances available  training  quotas,  ATS  throughput,  schoolhouse  capacities  and  course  requirements on  a  Fiscal  Year  basis.    Annually,  units  will  send  projected  PFT  requirements  to  their respective  MAJCOM  quota  managers,  who  in  turn  compile  and  forward  projections  to AF/A3OI,  for  inclusion  into  the  Graduate  Program  Requirements  Document  (GPRD).  Training  commands  will  determine  training  capacity  and  report  shortfall  in  the  GPRD  to AF/A3OI. 1.14.1.1.  AF/A3OI sponsors an annual PFT conference for attendees to balance training capacity,  MAJCOM  training  requests,  and  pipeline  Undergraduate  Flying  Training students (Rated and Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA)) against Formal Training Unit (FTU) capacity.  The training command allocates approved quotas to user commands, which in-turn  allocate  training  quotas  to  subordinate  units.    The  training  command  publishes  the annual PFT quota workbook. 1.14.1.2.  Throughout  the  training  year,  MAJCOM  training  staff  and  PFT  managers  use assigned/allocated  training  quotas  to  assign  individual  crewmembers  to  formal  training quotas.    Daily  student  quota  adjustments  to  the  annual  PFT  are  made  on  quota management documents. 1.15.  Information  Management.  AMC/A3T  hosts  aircrew  training  information  on  a  military website.  Training event descriptions are maintained on the website, as well as non-ATS training courses (e.g., GRACC, FM Immunity, ATD status, host nation agreements (HNA), etc.).  Site is: https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/a3t/default.aspx. 1.16.  Failure  to  Progress  or  Complete  Training.  If  the  training  received  leads  to  a qualification  or  certification  that  must  be  met  for  the  unit’s  mission,  comply  with  syllabus guidelines.    If  a  crewmember  fails  to  complete  a  formal  course,  the  formal  school  will  send  a recommendation to the individual’s gaining unit.  The recommendation will state whether he or she  should  complete  training  in-unit,  return  to  the  formal  school  to  complete  training,  or  be referred to the AF personnel system for reassignment. AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 21 1.16.1.  Progress Review Board (PRB).  If a student fails to progress in accordance with the requirements in this volume, the trainee’s gaining flying unit Sq/CC will conduct a progress review.  A PRB will be convened to review the trainee’s records and recommend continuing training, re-training, modify training, or a Flight Evaluation Board (FEB).  OG/CC will have final  approval  of  PRB  recommendations.    (See  AFI  11-402,  Aviation  and  Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, for FEB and administrative procedures.  Note: In certain  situations,  AFI  11-402,  Chapter  3  and  4  outline  additional  information  regarding removal  from  training  short  of  the  FEB  process  for  initial  CEA  training.)    The  ATS contractor  will  identify  students  who  fail  to  progress  IAW  the  applicable  ATS  guidance  as outlined in Chapter 6. 1.16.1.1.  The make-up of the PRB will be at the Sq/CC’s discretion, but will include, as a  minimum,  Sq/CC,  OST  and  OGV  representatives,  and  the  FTU  Chief.    Phase  I  ATS and Det 1 (or Det 1 designated attendee) will be represented as well.   Each  unit  will  determine their  process  for 1.16.2.  Supervised  Status/Retraining. documenting  performance  which  would  put  a  crewmember  into  a  supervised  status.    This process  will  include  how  and  where  to  document  the  crewmember’s  retraining.    As  a minimum, an AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder, or electronic equivalent is opened for the  retraining  unless  waived  IAW  paragraph  A2.1.1.1.    The  crewmember’s  unit  should develop  a  training  plan,  coordinate  training  resource  requirements  through  OSS/OST,  then gain  Sq/CC  approval.    For  those  individuals  being  trained  at  the  FTU  (initial  qualification, requalification,  and  upgrade),  FTU  instructor(s)  will  coordinate  the  training  plan  and  gain FTU Chief approval.  The AF Form 4025, Aircrew Summary/Close-Out Report, or electronic equivalent  documenting  the  completed  training  will  then  be  given  to  the  unit’s  Stan/Eval section  IAW  paragraph  A2.1.5  and  the  crewmember  will  be  rechecked  at  the  Sq/CC’s discretion (exercised through Stan/Eval). 1.17.  Career  Enlisted  Aviator  Skill  Levels.  CEAs  are  not  tied  to  AFI  36-2101,  Classifying Military  Personnel  (Officer  and  Enlisted),  and  skill  level  upgrade.    All  enlisted  aircrew qualifications  are  separate  and  distinct  from  skill  level  qualification.    When  AF  Form  8, Certificate  of  Aircrew  Qualification  as  prescribed  in  AFI  11-202,  Volume  2,  Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program is completed for the applicable flight evaluation, then that crewmember  is  qualified  to  perform  all  duties  assigned  to  that  crew  qualification  regardless  of skill  level.    Aircrew  instructor  and  flight  examiner  qualifications  are  also  separate  and  distinct from on the job training (OJT) trainer or certifier designation and are reflected in AFSC by use of  "K"  prefix  (aircrew  instructor),  “T”  prefix  (aircrew  FTU  instructor),  and  "Q"  prefix (standardization and evaluation flight examiner). 1.18.  Aircrew  Training  Quota  Management.  The  following  information  describes  AMC's policy and procedures for quota management.  This  policy is  mandatory  for all AMC  units;  all other units follow their MAJCOM guidance. 1.18.1.  Wing training offices (OSS/OST) will submit the rank, full name, SSAN, course, and class  number  via  e-mail  to  AMC/A3TF  NLT  45  days  prior  to  class  start  date  (CSD).  Training  quotas  not  filled  45  days  prior  to  CSD  will  be  offered  to  the  next  unit  on  the AMC/A3TF standby list.  OSS/OST should confirm all scheduled training with their units at least 10 days prior to CSD to ensure notification of training, active duty service commitments are established, and orders issued. 22 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 1.18.1.1.  All course prerequisites will be completed NLT 30 days prior to CSD to allow for remedial training or substitution.  Units will internally identify an alternate candidate for  each  allocated  quota.    If  the  primary  candidate  becomes  unavailable,  notify AMC/A3TF with the alternate's information. 1.18.1.2.  Foreign  exchange  officers  cannot  be  locally  substituted  (they  must  also  be identified when submitted to load against an allocation), send the replacement's full data to AMC/A3TF. 1.18.1.3.  Return all unused quotas to AMC/A3TF NLT 45 days prior to CSD. 1.18.1.4.  All  no-shows and late cancellations within 7 days of CSD must be explained.  Forward  an  initial  report  of  circumstances  to  AMC/A3TF  Quota  Manager  within  24 hours  of  notification.    This  initial  notification  will  be  followed  by  a  memorandum  of explanation from the OG/CC to AMC/A3T within one week.  Please send the e-mail to: AMC.A3T@us.af.mil and courtesy copy the appropriate AMC/A3TF Quota Manager. 1.18.1.5.  Send  requests  for  additional  quotas  to  AMC/A3TF.    If  unit  capability  is  in jeopardy,  AMC/A3TF  will  coordinate  with  Air  Staff  to  add/or  reallocate  additional quotas.    AMC/A3TF  quota  managers  will  coordinate  with  the  wing  training  offices (OSS/OST) exclusively.  Squadrons or individuals will be referred to their OSS training office.  Please submit the name/phone number/e-mail for the primary and alternate point of contact for quota management in wing training office. 1.18.1.6.  AMC  units  are  prohibited  from  coordinating  quota  exchanges  with  other commands.    OSS/OST  training  offices  will  forward  all  requests  to  the  AMC  quota manager for coordination with other commands.  Please allow for extended coordination time when considering this option. 1.18.2.  HQ AMC Orientation Tour / GRACC.  GRACC is an Aircraft Commander overview of the offices and functions of Air Mobility Command.  Questions regarding GRACC can be referred to the POC at AMC.A3TA@us.af.mil. 1.18.3.  Senior  Officer  Training  coordination.    Questions  regarding  Senior  Officer  training Course (SOC), availability  and prerequisites can be forwarded to  AMC/A3TF at  DSN 779-3577.    No  formal  actions  to  schedule  training  will  be  taken  until  directed  by  AF/DPO  or AF/DPG in conjunction with MAJCOM Senior Leaders Management offices. Table 1.3.  Seating Chart.

AFI 11-202, Volume 1 defines initial qualification training.  This chapter  specifies  minimum  training  requirements  for  initial  qualification,  requalification, conversion/difference qualification, and senior officer courses.  Phase IA training is provided by the ATS contractor and consists of academic training and various ATDs.  Following successful completion of Phase IA, Phase IB is conducted at the Formal Training Unit (FTU) where aircraft training  is  received.    MCT  training  completes  all  remaining  mission  ready  and  qualification/ certification  training  requirements.    The  sole  method  of  KC-10  initial  qualification  is  to  attend and  complete  the  appropriate  formal  training  course  listed  at  the  ETCA  website.    The  website address is: https://etca.randolph.af.mil/default1.asp. 2.2.  IQT  Prerequisites.

Required prior to first aircraft flight.  Mandatory grounding item; individual will not fly until required training is accomplished. Flight physicals become due 366 days after the previous physical, and expire after the 455th day or as indicated on the AF IMT 1042, whichever occurs first.  The required frequency may vary to address waivers and/or individual physical limitations (as determined by the Flight Surgeon), but in no case will exceed 455 days. 2.  Accomplish SS02 or SS05 if more than 36 months since completion of SS20 or SS32.   3.  Crewmembers in initial qualification or requalification are required to complete prior to flying to destinations OCONUS. 4.  AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 1 is not the governing directive for completion of this event.  IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, paragraph 6, refer to reference publications which provide guidance for accomplishment of ancillary training requirements. 5.  Accomplish within 30 days of initial assignment or PCS per AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground. 6.  Not required for BAQ, BMC crewmembers (i.e. crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM Headquarters, NAF, 618 AOC (TACC), and USAF Expeditionary Center), or Senior Officers. 7.  Required prior to first flight at home station; students attending training at a location other than their permanent assigned base require SS01 prior to first flight at the training location as well. 8.  To be certified as mission ready the individual is only required to submit the application for passport. 9.  Prior MWS Initial VTRAT does not satisfy the requirement of VT01.  Prior MWS crew members must attend VT01 for the KC-10. 10.  For Flight Engineers and Boom Operators, only the Iridium Phone training portion of G080 is required 2.4.  Flying  Training  Requirements.  Complete  flying  training  requirements  for  initial qualification in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 1; AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 1, Chapter 3 and Attachment 3; and published KC-10 course syllabi. 2.5.  Conversion/Differences Qualification Training Requirements.  When possible, qualified personnel in other units will provide the initial cadre.  In some instances, it will be necessary for units  to  form  an  initial  cadre  of  aircrew  personnel  for  whom  certain  training  qualification requirements may be waived.  The following conditions will apply to the management of initial cadre aircrew qualification: 2.5.1.  Form  a  nucleus  of  instructor  and  flight  examiner  personnel  (initial  cadre)  to  begin aircrew conversion/differences training.  Converting units may request initial cadre waiver of primary aircraft inventory (PAI) time requirement.  Send waiver request through MAJCOM training staff in the format in paragraph 1.5.9.  Additionally, include the most recent aircraft flown and total time in that aircraft in the remarks section.  (T-1) 2.5.1.1.  Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held, e.g. C-130 mission pilot (MP) to KC-10 examiner pilot (EP), unless previously qualified at that level in the conversion aircraft, i.e. prior KC-10 EP. AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 27 2.5.1.2.  After  final  approval,  publish  a  unit  letter  to  identify  initial  cadre  of  instructors and flight examiners by crew qualification. 2.6.  Multiple Qualifications.  Crewmembers will attend a formal initial qualification course for dual  qualification  in  different  MDS  aircraft.    Crewmembers  maintaining  dual  qualification  in different  model  aircraft  will,  as  a  minimum,  maintain  FTL  A  currency  requirements  in  each aircraft  (N/A  for  senior  officers;  see  paragraph    2.7).    Further  guidance  on  multiple qualifications is available in AFI 11-202, Volume 1, paragraph 2.6. 2.7.  Senior  Officer  Qualification  Training  Requirements.  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1  identifies senior  officer  qualification  requirements.    Senior  Officer  Course  (SOC)  graduates  will  be assigned  FTL  E  for  continuation  training  purposes,  and  will  not  fly  unsupervised  in  a  primary crew position (see paragraph  4.3.1.4). 2.7.1.  After  qualification  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1,  and  with  OG/CC  approval,  senior officers  (assigned  or  attached)  may  seek  training  which  leads  to  a  higher  FTL  and/or qualification.  The unit OSS/OST office is responsible for determining training requirements based  on  the  senior  officer’s  flying  experience  and  familiarity  with  the  weapons  system.  AMC/A3T  or  appropriate  MAJCOM/A3T  will  approve  the  proposed  training  plan  prior  to execution.  (T-2) 2.7.2.  In order to keep the course length to a minimum, and maximize the students’ training time, a suite of CBT lessons must be viewed prior to attendance at the Senior Officer Course.  These  CBT  lessons  can  be  found  at  https://www.kc10ats.com.    Contact  AMC/A3TK  for assistance (DSN 779-2553). 2.7.3.  As a minimum, Senior Officers and all other crewmembers maintaining BMC or BAQ status  in  the  KC-10  will  maintain  FTL  E  requirements.    Senior  Officers  on  MR  status  will comply  with  Table  4.3.    FTL  E  crewmembers  must  always  fly  with  an  instructor  of  like specialty.  This requirement also applies to additional aircraft an individual may be qualified in (see multiple qualifications).  See AFI 11-2KC10, Volume 3, AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and AFI 11-401 for additional restrictions when flying with passengers. 2.8.  Flight Surgeons.  Flight Surgeons are allowed to fly locally as defined by OG/CC and log time in their primary MDS while in training for initial (mission) qualification.  See AFI 11-202, Volume 1 for training requirements. 2.9.  Requalification  Training  (RQT).  An  aircrew  member  is  unqualified  upon  expiration  of the  qualification  evaluation,  loss  of  currency  exceeding  6  months  (for  the  following  currency items,  Pilots:  P020,  P070,  P190,  and  R010  –  current  Form  8  with  receiver  AR  qualification. Flight  Engineers:  M010.  Boom  Operators:  R120  and  P300.),  failure  of  a  periodic  or  spot evaluation,  when  down-graded  by  the  Sq/CC,  or  completion  of  a  qualification  evaluation  in  a different  MDS  (unless  authorized  multiple  qualifications).    The  duration  of  unqualified  time  is from the date the aircrew member became unqualified until the specific retraining start date.  For Active  Duty  Service  Commitments  for  aircrew  training,  see  AFI  36-2107.    See  AFI  11-202, Volume  1  for  additional  requalification  training  limits  and  requirements.    NOTE:    Additional training requirements as a result of an unsatisfactory evaluation (periodic or spot) or commander-directed  downgrades  are  at  the  discretion  of  the  evaluator  and  timeline  for  completion  is  IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 2.  Unit training organizations will coordinate with unit Stan Eval to track completion and review status at monthly squadron TRPs. 28 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 2.9.1.  Requalifying  KC-10  crewmembers  will  complete  in-unit  or  formal  school  training (IAW  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1)  and  accomplish  those  mission  qualification/certification events from Table 2.1,  3.1,  4.1, and  4.2 that have expired or are overdue.  See Table 1.2 for in-unit training timeline. 2.9.1.1.  Training items to be accomplished during the requalification will be determined by a thorough review of the individual’s flying training/history documentation conducted by  the  appropriate  training  authority  (Sq/DOT  for  in-unit  requalification,  or  FTU  if formal school requalification).  These items will be annotated on the AF Form 4024, or electronic  equivalent,  in  the  individual’s  training  folder  and  specified  on  the  in-unit requalification letter if applicable. 2.9.2.  Former  KC-10  instructors  may  accomplish  instructor  requalification  concurrent  with basic requalification (in-unit or formal course) for their crew position.  In all cases of loss of qualification  exceeding  39  months,  all  special  qualifications  and  certifications  must  be  re-accomplished.    If  the  gaining  squadron  commander  determines  that  the  individual  requires additional seasoning prior to performing instructor duties, an individual can be certified as an aircraft commander (pilots) or basic qualification (flight engineers/boom operators) until the squadron commander determines the individual is ready to be certified as an instructor. 2.9.3.  Requalification  Training  Courses.    Unqualified  crew  members  will  complete  the appropriate TX-1, TX-2, TX-3 (longest to shortest) courses outlined below. 2.9.3.1.  Pilot, Flight Engineer, and Boom Operator TX-1, TX-2, TX-3 Courses: 2.9.3.1.1.  Unqualified  KC-10  crewmembers  (over  8  years)  will  complete  the  Initial Qualification  (PIQ,  ACIQ,  FIQ,  BBQ)  formal  school  flying  training  course  (TX-1) and  a  flight  evaluation.    An  active  duty  or  reserve  service  commitment  is  required IAW AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC). 2.9.3.1.2.  Unqualified KC-10 crewmembers (greater than 39 months at  the end of a non-flying assignment or 51 months at the end of any active flying assignment up to 8 years) will complete the Pilot Requalification (PRQ), Flight Engineer Requalification (FRQ),  and  Boom  Operator  Requalification  (BRQ)  formal  school  flying  training course  (TX-2)  as  appropriate  and  a  flight  evaluation.    An  active  duty  or  reserve service commitment is required IAW AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC). 2.9.3.1.3.  Unqualified  KC-10  crewmembers  (up  to  39  months  at  the  end  of  a  non-flying  assignment  or  51  months  at  the  end  of  any  active  flying  assignment)  will complete  a  Sq/CC  directed  requalification  (TX-3)  course  in-unit  and  a  flight evaluation.    Note:  The  Requalification  formal  school  flying  training  courses  in paragraph   2.9.3.1.2 may  be substituted for the in-unit training.  An active duty  or reserve service commitment is required for in-unit or formal training course IAW AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC). 2.9.3.1.3.1.  Squadron  commanders  may  tailor  or  expand  the  TX-3  course  based on  individual  proficiency  and  experience.    Unqualified  pilots  will  complete training  in  all  delinquent  items,  additional  training  as  directed  by  the  squadron commander,  and  a  flight  evaluation.    The  flying  unit  Sq/CC  will  determine requirements  for  accomplishment  of  events  from  Table  3.1  that  are  not AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 29 continuation training events, e.g. Fighter Deployment Operations (M260). 2.10.  Formal  Training  Unit  (FTU)  Guidance.  The  KC-10  Formal  Training  Units  conduct training  at  two  schoolhouses  located  at  Travis  AFB  and  Joint  Base  McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.  Specific course information is located in Attachment 3 and KC-10 formal course syllabi located on the ATS website: https://www.kc10ats.com and the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB). 30 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 Chapter 3 MISSION QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION TRAINING 3.1.  Description.  This  chapter  establishes  minimum  mission  ready  criteria  and  training requirements  to  be  accomplished  during  mission  certification  training  (MCT).    Except  where specifically stated, squadrons may arrange mission sequence or sequence of items as necessary to use  flying  training  hours  effectively  and  accomplish  the  unit  mission.    All  crewmembers  will complete  initial  qualification  (Phase  IA/IB)  and  MCT,  but  are  not  necessarily  required  to  be certified in the unit’s mission before entering special certification (i.e. large formation, formation lead, etc.) training.  Crewmembers in MCT may participate in exercises (see paragraph  1.6.2). 3.1.1.  Mission  certification  is  the  primary  certification  and  must  be  completed  prior  to crewmembers deploying. 3.2.  Time  Periods  for  Mission  Certification  Training.  See  Table  1.2.    During  this  period, crewmembers  will  complete  remaining  requirements  from  Table  2.1  and  flying  training requirements in  Table  3.1.  Upon successful  completion, a crewmember will be mission ready (MR) after review and certification by Sq/CC or a Review and Certification (R&C) Board for all aircraft  commanders  (AC)  and  all  instructor  candidates  according  to  AFI  11-202,  Volume  2, AMC Supplement. 3.2.1.  Upon completion of all MCT requirements from Table 2.1 and  3.1, PCO, ACIQ and PRQ graduates will be counted as MR pilots for Status Of Resources and Training Systems (SORTS)  and  TRP  purposes  and  may  fly  as  an  FPL  on  any  crew,  including  operational missions.  PCO, ACIQ and PRQ graduates are not MPs and may not fly as pilot-in-command until  formally  certified  by  the  Sq/CC.    See  paragraph    5.2  for  additional  requirements  for Mobility Pilot Development (MPD) pilot certification as aircraft commander. 3.2.2.  Basic  Qualified  Boom  Operators  (FB)  flying  during  MCT  (who  are  current  and qualified  in  the  aircraft)  may  fly  without  an  instructor  of  like  specialty  on  CONUS-only sorties.  See paragraph  3.3.1 for minimum ground training requirements. 3.3.  Ground Training Requirements.  All crewmembers will accomplish any remaining events from Table 2.1 that were not previously accomplished while at the FTU.  Aircrew members will complete  all  academic  ground  training  events  required  for  mission  certification  in  the  unit’s operational  mission  (not  applicable  for  senior  officers  or  staff  officers  maintaining  BAQ).  Training may be accomplished concurrently with other training. 3.3.1.  Training sorties and operational missions may be flown before completing all events, provided Aircraft Marshaling Exam (G002), Flight Physical, Physiological Training, Aircrew Flight Equipment Familiarization (LL01), Egress Training (LL03), and Local Area Survival (SS01)  are  accomplished.    Ground  training  events  required  for  the  mission  must  be completed  prior  to  being  flown.    Pilots  will  complete  Overwater  Navigation  Procedures (G160)  prior  to  flying  to  destinations  OCONUS.    Boom  Operators  will  complete  Boom Operator Cockpit Orientation CBT (G272) prior to their first flight. 3.3.2.  Graduates of the formal Pilot Check Out Course need only accomplish ground training events in which they have lost currency. AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 31 3.3.3.  The  ATS  contractor  post-graduate  questionnaire  will  be  completed  by  the  student three months after scheduled Phase IB graduation date. 3.3.4.  Certified  or  qualified  MR  crewmembers  transferring  between  KC-10  main  operating bases  (MOB)  will  require  Aircraft  Ground  Marshaling  Training  and  Examination  (G002), ISOPREP  Review  (G120),  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment  Familiarization  (LL01),  Local  Area Survival  (SS01),  and  unit-specific  MR  training  events  (and  events  in  which  they  may  have lost currency during the change-of-station).  See paragraph 1.12.1 and  3.4.2 for additional information. 3.3.5.  Ground  training  events  accomplished  during  MCT  establish  the  crewmember’s  due dates for subsequent continuation training.  Completion of Combat SERE Training, Wartime Level  C  (SS20)  or  Evasion  Conduct  After  Capture  (SS19)  (FS  Only),  Water  Survival Training,  Non-Parachuting  (SS32),  and  initial  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment  Familiarization (during formal school) establishes the due date (based on date of first completed course) for recurring  Combat  SERE  Training  (SS02),  Conduct  After  Capture  (SS03),  Water  Survival Training  (SS05),  and  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment  Training  (LL06).    Completion  of  SS20  or SS19 (FS only) also establishes the due date for recurring Law of Armed Conflict (G100). 3.4.  Flying Training Requirements: 3.4.1.  Upgrade  students.    Complete  mission  certification  flying  training  requirements  in Table 3.1.  Items accomplished to the appropriate proficiency level during FTU count toward this  mission  ready  table.    Use  date  of  successful  evaluation  to  establish  currency requirements  for  these  events.    BAQ  crewmembers  pursuing  MR  status  will  be  assigned  a Flight  Training  Level  and  accomplish  continuation  training  requirements  IAW  Chapter  4.  Crewmembers in upgrade training will credit all events accomplished during Phase IA, Phase IB,  and  MCT  IAW  paragraph  4.4.1.    Crewmembers  pursuing  MR  status  who  fail  to accomplish  minimum  aircrew  requirements  (currency  and  semi-annual)  must  fly  in  a supervised status when that event is required for a particular flight until the delinquent event or currency is corrected. 3.4.2.  After  arrival  at  the  duty  station  following  a  PCS  from  the  other  KC-10  MOB, crewmembers will receive a local area briefing and supervised local orientation flight.  The lack of a local briefing and local flight does not preclude the crewmember from deploying as MR.    The  crewmember  must  accomplish  all  grounding  items  prior  to  the  local  orientation flight.  See paragraph 1.12.1 and  3.3.4 for additional information. 3.4.3.  MPD  Pilots  selected  for  PCO  upgrade  certification  training  must  re-accomplish  all applicable events in Table 3.1, except for N013, N014, P260, P270, P280, and P290, with an emphasis on aircraft commander duties and responsibilities prior to certification.

When  training  is completed, individual’s  certification  as  an  Aircraft Commander. the  Sq/CC  determines the 3.5.3.  Flight Engineer Basic Prequalification (FBP) and Flight Engineer Initial Qualification (FIQ):  The object of MCT is to provide graduated exposure to the duties of a KC-10 Flight Engineer prior to  MF certification.  To streamline Flight  Engineer training, Phases  IIA and IIB has been combined into one MCT program.  This allows for the ability to credit events when training becomes available. See Table 1.2 for MCT timeline. AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 33 3.5.3.1.  FBP  Students:    MCT  begins  the  first  duty  day  following  the  successful completion  of  Phase  IB  evaluation  and  ends  when  the  requirements  in  this  chapter  and Table  2.1  are  complete  and  documented  IAW  Attachment  2.    FBP  students  require  a minimum  of  two  M261s  and  two  M262s.    The  first  M261  and  M262  need  only  to  be completed  and  documented  to  a  satisfactory  level  before  completing  the  second  M261 and  M262.    The  second  M261  and  M262  must  be  completed  and  documented  to  a proficient  level  IAW  Attachment  2  prior  to  MF  certification.    Consecutive  M261s  and M262s  are  authorized  in  order  to  take  full  advantage  of  every  training  opportunity.  NOTE:    A  Dual  Role  can  only  satisfy  one  M261  and  one  M262  requirement  for  MCT training.  If a second Dual Role mission is to be used to accomplish the requisite M261 and/or M262, a waiver is required to be submitted to the OG/CC IAW paragraph  1.5.3 of this instruction. 3.5.3.1.1.  FBP  students  will  fly  local  training  sorties  under  IF  supervision  and  may fly  local  training  sorties  unsupervised  once  the  following  items  listed  below  have been completed to the required level (B/S/P) and properly documented to the desired grade  as  indicated.    Exception:    FBP  students  will  not  fly  on  local  training  sorties where cargo loading is being accomplished without IF supervision. 3.5.3.1.1.1.

After achieving designated grade in the events in paragraph 3.5.3.1.1 and sub  paragraphs,  and  prior  to  flying  local  training  sorties  unsupervised,  squadron training  office  will  document  a  recommendation  in  the  student’s  training  folder suggesting the student be able to fly unsupervised.  This recommendation will then be reviewed and endorsed by the Sq/CC. 3.5.3.1.3.  The  FBP  students  must  have  at  least  150  hours  of  flight  time  after  the Phase IB evaluation to achieve MF certification.  This requirement may be waived by the OG/CC on a case-by-case basis.  (T-3) 3.5.3.1.4.  For  cargo  missions  only,  FBP  students  may  fill  the  second  engineer augmentation  requirement  once  all  items  listed  above  have  been  completed  and provided  the  other  Flight  Engineer  is  an  instructor.    Crew  augmentation  criteria  are outlined in AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 3, KC-10 Operations Procedures. 3.5.3.2.  FIQ  students:    MCT  begins  the  first  duty  day  following  the  successful completion  of  Phase  IB  evaluation  and  ends  when  the  requirements  in  this  chapter  and Table  2.1  are  complete  and  documented  IAW  Attachment  2.    FIQ  students  require  a minimum  of  only  one  M261  and  M262  documented  to  a  proficient  level  IAW Attachment 2 before MF certification. 34 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 3.5.3.2.1.  FIQ students may fly local training sorties unsupervised.  Exception:  FIQ students  will  not  fly  on  local  training  sorties  where  cargo  loading  is  being accomplished without IF supervision. 3.5.3.2.2.  For  cargo  missions  only,  FIQ  students  may  fill  the  second  engineer augmentation requirement provided the other Flight Engineer is an instructor.  Crew augmentation  criteria  are outlined in  AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 3,  KC-10 Operations Procedures. 3.5.4.  KC-10  Basic  Boom  Operator  Qualification  (BBQ):    MCT  consists  of    two  training phases; Phase IIA, Academic Ground Cargo Load Training and Phase IIB, Flight Cargo Load Training.  See Table 1.2 for MCT training time limitations. 3.5.4.1.  Phase  IIA  Academic/Ground  Cargo  Load  Training.    Training  consists  of  a  15 training day academic program in basic cargo loading operations utilizing a combination of  classroom  instruction,  CBTs,  and  P302  cargo  loads.    Student  duties  are  limited  to attendance/completion  of  Phase  IIA.      The  primary  instructor  will  complete  an  end  of course  assessment  detailing  progression,  recommendations,  and  documenting  Phase  IIA training  completion  on  AF  Form  4025  or  electronic  equivalent.    The  assessment  will assist  squadron  leadership  and  training  flights  in  determining  if  the  student  should progress to Phase IIB or if additional academic/ground training is required prior to Phase IIB  start.    Phase  IIB  shall  not  commence  until  Phase  IIA  has  been  successfully completed. 3.5.4.2.  Phase IIB Flight Cargo Load Training.  Training starts upon completion of Phase IIA.  This phase consists of flight cargo training utilizing P300 and P301 cargo missions.  It  will  include  at  least  one  cargo  load  and  one  recommend  ride  cargo  load.    The recommend ride cannot be conducted on the student’s first P300 or P301 mission. 3.5.4.3.  Fighter  contact  certification  training  will  be  IAW  requirements  of  Q022/Q023 detailed  in  paragraph  5.6.3,    7.14.10,  and    7.14.11    Mission  ready  status  shall  not  be granted until fighter certifications are attained. 3.5.4.4.  MCT  Completion.    MCT  is  complete  upon  successful  accomplishment  of  the Q180  Cargo  Loading  evaluation  IAW  AFI  11-2KC-10,  Volume  2  and  requirements  of Table  2.1  and  3.1.    However,  boom  operators  will  not  perform  any  cargo  operations unsupervised until mission ready certified by the Sq/CC. 3.5.4.4.1.  If an MCT student fails Q180 and will exceed the allotted training timeline, then a waiver must be completed through A3T while also adhering to the AFI 11-202, Volume 2 requirements. 3.5.5.  Flight Surgeon Mission Qualification Requirements.  Flight Surgeon requirements are outlined in AFI 11-202, Volume 1. AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 35 Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  Description.  This  chapter  establishes  the  minimum  flying  and  related  ground  training requirements  to  maintain  currency  and  qualification.    The  unit  commander  will  ensure crewmembers receive sufficient continuation training to maintain individual proficiency. 4.2.  Aircrew Status.  KC-10 crewmembers are assigned to Mission Ready (MR), Non-Mission Ready (NMR), Basic Mission Capable (BMC), or Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. 4.2.1.  Mission  Ready  (MR).    For  SORTS,  operational  tasking,  and  deployments,  a  MR crewmember  is  defined  as  one  who  is  available  and  certified  in  the  squadron’s  mission (completed qualification and mission certification training for applicable crew position). 4.2.2.  Non-Mission  Ready  (NMR).    A  crewmember  that  is  unqualified,  non-current  or incomplete in required continuation training, or not certified to perform the unit mission.  See paragraph  4.9 for specific guidance on crewmembers that are non-current or incomplete in required continuation training. 4.2.3.  Basic Mission Capable (BMC).  A non-mission  ready  (NMR) crewmember assigned to  MAJCOM  headquarters,  NAF,  618  AOC  (TACC),  USAF  Expeditionary  Center, Contingency Response Wing (CRW), or Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) who has satisfactorily completed  mission  certification  training  and  does  not  maintain  MR  status,  but  maintains familiarization in the command or unit’s operational mission. 4.2.3.1.  The crewmember may maintain qualification in some aspects of the unit mission and is able to attain full qualification in the unit mission within 45 days. 4.2.3.2.  BMC crewmembers whose aircrew position is either instructor or examiner, may log instructor or examiner time for the portion of the mission for which they are current and qualified and performing instructor or examiner duties.  Otherwise, they will log FP, FF or FB time. 4.2.4.  Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ).  A crewmember that has satisfactorily completed initial qualification training and is qualified to perform aircrew duties in the unit aircraft. 4.2.5.  MR,  BMC,  and  BAQ  crewmembers  must  accomplish  and/or  maintain the requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 1 (for their respective status) and the appropriate events in the ground and semi-annual flying continuation tables in Chapter 4. 4.3.  Flying Training Levels. 4.3.1.  The  Sq/CC  assigns  crewmember  Flying  Training  Levels  (FTL)  (see  paragraph  1.4.6.5).  NMR crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM headquarters, NAF, 618 AOC (TACC), USAF  Expeditionary  Center,  CRW,  or  a  DRU  are  normally  categorized  as  BMC  and assigned FTL A or E.  FTL A NMR crewmembers mentioned above may fly unsupervised on CONUS training missions provided they are current and qualified. 4.3.1.1.  FTL A–Highly Experienced Crewmembers (including BAQ Highly Experienced Crewmembers pursuing MR status).  As a guide, crewmembers having 10 or more years of operational flying experience (i.e., MR or NMR MAJCOM headquarters staff and 618 36 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 AOC  (TACC)  personnel;  NAF  personnel;  USAFEC  instructors,  Wg/CC,  OG/CC,  and Sq/CC,  operations  officers,  and  crewmembers  assigned  to  OG  evaluation  positions).  Sq/CC may assign highly experienced MR line crewmembers to FTL A. (including  BAQ  Experienced 4.3.1.2.  FTL  B–Experienced  MR  Crewmember Crewmembers  pursuing  MR  status).    As  a  guide,  crewmembers  having  between  5-10 years of operational flying experience. 4.3.1.3.  FTL C–MR Crewmember.  Initially assign inexperienced MR crewmembers and inexperienced individuals pursuing MR status after initial qualification training to FTL C.  As a guide, crewmembers having less than 5 years of operational flying experience. 4.3.1.4.  FTL  E–BAQ  or  BMC  non-instructor  staff.    This  training  level  may  include senior officers, MAJCOM, NAF, 618 AOC (TACC), CRW, and DRU staff who are not maintaining MR or instructor status.  FTL E requirements are insufficient for MR status and crewmembers assigned to this FTL will fly with an instructor of like specialty at all times. 4.3.2.  Change of FTL.  Once the semi-annual period begins, do not move a crewmember to a level  requiring  fewer  events.    Exception:  Units  associating  FTLs  with  crew  positions  may change FTLs after upgrade i.e. instructor upgrade.  BAQ crewmembers may be placed into a different  FTL  any  time  after  attaining  MR  status.    Prorate  events  upon  changing  training levels. 4.4.  Training  Events/Tables.  Standardized  ARMS  training  event  identifiers  and  descriptions can be found in Chapter 7.  Unit defined events will be designated “X” events (i.e. X020) and listed  in  local  supplement.    Proration  of  training  information  can  be  found  in  Table  4.5  and paragraph  4.8 of this AFI. 4.4.1.  Crediting  Event  Accomplishment.    Crewmembers  may  credit  events  accomplished during  training,  MCT,  operational  missions,  and  satisfactory  evaluations  toward  currency requirements and establish a subsequent due date.  They must be qualified in the events and either current or under the supervision of an instructor.  Use date of successful evaluation as the  date  of  accomplishment  for  all  flying  training  currency  events  that  were  trained  during the formal or in-unit course.  Crewmembers may credit G240, that quarter’s G261-G264 (as appropriate), and G292 refresher training upon satisfactory completion of evaluation of any formal or in-unit course for the current quarter (use the simulator evaluation date as the date of accomplishment).  ATS courses are listed in Table 6.2 (see paragraph  4.8 for proration).  For  upgrade  students  (not  initial  qualification  or  requalification  students),  continuation training  events  accomplished  during  upgrade  training  prior  to  the  evaluation  are  credited towards  the  requirements  for  the  current  crew  position.    Do  not  log  training  events  for  the upgrading crew position prior to the evaluation. 4.4.2.  For  an  unsatisfactory  flight  evaluation,  do  not  log  continuation  training  event  items graded unsatisfactory (according to AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 2) until re-qualified. 4.4.3.  Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.  For G220,  flight  engineers  and  boom  operators  must  accomplish  systems  refresher  material  for the missed quarter. AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 37 4.4.4.  Instructors and flight examiners may credit up to but not more than 50 percent of their semiannual  training  requirements  while  instructing  or  evaluating  (for  example,  if  a  FTL  A instructor Flight Engineer instructed 2 M010s when the requirement is 3, the instructor could only credit 1 for the half).  Exception:  Instructor and flight examiner pilots may not credit any  takeoffs,  landings,  or  receiver  air  refueling  (rendezvous  may  be  credited)  flown  by another  pilot.    Instructor  and  examiner  boom  operators  must  accomplish  all  their  own contacts. 4.4.5.  Records  and  Documentation.    Units  will  use  AF  Form  1522,  ARMS  Additional Training  Accomplishment  Report  prescribed  by  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1,  to  record  training accomplishments.  Course instructors will deliver these forms to the appropriate scheduling and training documentation sections within one duty day after the class is taught.  Small arms training  (G280)  will  be  recorded  on  AF  Form  522,  USAF  Ground  Weapons  Training  Data IAW AFI 36-2654, Combat Arms Program. 4.4.5.1.  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1,  units  may  use  locally  developed  mission accomplishment  reports  (MAR),  or  electronic  equivalent,  to  document  continuation training.  Minimum requirements for the MAR is defined within this chapter and tables. 4.5.  Continuation Training Requirements. 4.5.1.  Ground  Training  Events.    Completion  and  tracking  of  continuation  training  is  the responsibility  of  the  individual  crewmember.    Crewmembers  shall  actively  work  with  unit schedulers  and  training  offices  to  ensure  their  continuation  training  is  accomplished  as described in this chapter. 4.5.2.  Ground Training Events.  Crewmembers will comply with requirements of Table 4.1 and 4.2. 4.5.2.1.  Failure to accomplish events in Table 4.1 leads to non-mission ready status.  See paragraph  4.9 for regaining mission ready status. 4.5.2.2.  Failure to complete mobility training requirements in Table 4.2 does not lead to non-mission  ready  status  but  may  restrict  member  from  certain  missions  requiring  the associated training.  Staff crewmembers (i.e. MAJCOM, NAF, 618 AOC (TACC), USAF EC,  etc.)  may  accomplish  ground  training  events  at  locations  other  than  their  unit  of attachment.  The crewmember is  responsible for reporting accomplished  training events to their unit of attachment (ARMS office). 4.5.2.3.  Ancillary Training.  See paragraph 4.7. 4.5.2.4.  Crewmembers  performing  extended  alert  duty  (more  than  72  hours)  may accomplish  ground  training  that  does  not  degrade  required  response  time  or  mission accomplishment.  Specify requirements and/or restrictions in MAJCOM supplements. 4.5.2.5.  All training events will be recorded in ARMS. 4.5.2.5.1.  Training  events  conducted  during  block  or  phase  training  may  be consolidated under one ARMS entry. 4.5.2.5.2.  Combined training events may have only one ARMS entry. 38 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 4.5.2.5.3.  Input  all  one-time  events  and  events  required  for  Permanent  Change-of-Station  (PCS)  in  the  ARMS  database.    Do  not  maintain  these  events  on  the crewmember’s currency reports.

Flying  Continuation  Training  Requirements.    Table  4.3  and    4.4  lists  standardized flying continuation training requirements.  See Chapter 7 for event descriptions. 4.5.3.1.  ATD  Credit  for  Training  Requirements.    Flight  events  creditable  in  the  ATDs are listed in Table 4.3 and 4.4.  For ARMS tracking, simulator events will be logged with an  “S”  prefixed  task  ID  in  ARMS.    Events  accomplished  during  Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO) will be logged with a “D” prefixed task ID in ARMS. All simulator accomplishments  must  be  documented  and  tracked  in  ARMS.  Ensure  the  maximum number of simulator creditable events is not exceeded. 4.5.3.2.  Continuation  Flying  Training.    Each  MAJCOM  provides  flying  hours  to  each wing as training, test, and ferry hours or operations and maintenance (O&M) hours.  The hours, based on FTL C, are designed to provide all crew positions with sufficient hours to accomplish all continuation flying training requirements. 4.5.3.3.  Mission profile and refresher simulators will be flown in the same manner as the aircraft, to include the wear and use of professional gear (headsets, etc.). 4.5.3.3.1.  Simulator sorties will be scheduled as ground events in GDSS (if able) and sortie  cancellation  authority  will (or  designated representative). the  OG/CC reside  with 4.5.3.3.2.  Pre-requisites  for  simulator  training  must  be  completed  prior  to  the simulator  start  time  or  the  training  may  be  cancelled.    AFRC  members  should accomplish  CBTs  prior  to  simulator  training,  but  the  sortie  will  not  be  cancelled  if this is not accomplished. AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 41 Table 4.3.

Logging of P301 followed by a P302 or vice a verse is authorized as long as different AMC/A3TK approved cargo loads are utilized. 6.  Boom Operators may not log consecutive P300 and P301 cargo loads for currency while performing evaluator duties. 7. P300 currency for all FTL A/B personnel is 180 days. 4.6.  Flight  Surgeon  Continuation  Flying  Requirements.  Flight  Surgeons  requirements  are outlined in and will be accomplished IAW AFI-11-202, Volume 1. 4.6.1.  For  contingency/AOR  missions,  Flight  Surgeons  must  also  be  current  for  all  SERE training as required by AFI 16-1301 as well as G120. 4.7.  Ancillary  Training.  Ancillary  Training  is  guidance  or  instruction  that  contributes  to mission accomplishment, but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or occupational series.  AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 1 is not the governing directive for completion of ancillary training events.  In accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 1, the source AFI provides training frequency for these events  unless  an  approved  waiver  has  been  authorized.    See  Unit  Deployment  Manger representative to ensure compliance with additional non-aircrew specific training requirements. 4.8.  Proration of Training.  AFI 11-202, Volume 1 describes proration of training requirements for crewmembers not available for flying duties.  In addition, prorate training for non-availability due  to  operational  deployments  when  the  Area  of  Responsibility  Special  Instructions  or  local deployed unit policy precludes training for certain mission events.  This authority must be used judiciously,  especially  when  prorating  the  same  crewmember  for  consecutive  semi-annual training periods. 4.8.1.  Use  this  formula  to  determine  training  requirements:  number  of  months  available times the event volume divided by the number of months in the training period.  Round down to the nearest whole number (e.g. 5.6 rounds to 5), but not less than 1 unless the individual was  available  for  less  than  15  days  during  the  semi-annual  period.    Document  proration  to zero on end-of-half training letter. 4.8.1.1.  Use  Table  4.5  to  determine  the  number  of  months  available.    Prorate  only  if absence  is  at  least  15  cumulative  days.    For  contingency  alerts  and  contingency  flying TDYs  non-consecutive  periods  of  non-availability  can  be  combined  for  proration purposes. 4.8.1.2.  When an individual permanently changes station (PCS) during the training cycle to a unit flying the same model aircraft and enters the same FTL or lower, credit training accomplished  at  the  previous  base.    Prorate  training  requirements  based  on  the  time available  (e.g.,  time  at  former  base,  plus  time  at  new  base,  minus  number  of  days  not available)  during  the  training  period.    Time  available  starts  7-days  after  sign-in  for CONUS and 14-days after sign-in for OCONUS or on the date of actual accomplishment 46 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 of  the  first  training  event,  whichever  occurs  first.    Subtract  previous  accomplishments from the prorated total to determine remaining requirements. 4.8.2.  Units  may  also  prorate  requirements  for  individuals  changing  training  levels.    If requirements are prorated, do not credit events accomplished while in the former FTL. 4.8.3.  For  upgrade  students,  continuation  training  requirements  will  be  prorated  from  their training  start  time  through  the  day  prior  to  the  successful  completion  of  their  upgrade evaluation  (see Table 4.5). 4.8.4.  For initial qualification and requalification students, training accomplished prior to the successful aircraft flight  portion of their evaluation will not  be credible towards their semi-annual  continuation  training  requirements.    They  are  considered  unavailable  for  proration purposes.    Initial  and  requalification  student’s  time  available  for  proration  purposes  begins the  duty  day  prior  to  the  successful  completion  of  their  initial  or  requalification  evaluation and will be prorated accordingly. Table 4.5.  Individual Availability. Days Available 0 - 15 16 - 45 46 - 75 76 - 105 106 - 135 136 - 165 ≥ 166 Months Available 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 4.9.  Failure  to  Complete  Training  Requirements.  Declare  individuals  NMR  if  they  fail  to maintain  flying  currencies,  fail training requirements,  or  fail  to  complete  ground  continuation  training  requirements.    The  following guidance applies: to  complete  semi-annual  flying  continuation 4.9.1.  Failure to Maintain Flying Currency. 4.9.1.1.  Flight  Training  Currency.    Flight  currency  is  associated  with  those  events denoted in  the flying continuation training tables by  a specific period of time (monthly, quarterly,  semi-annual,  or  annually)  within  which  an  event  must  be  accomplished.    A currency event must be accomplished at least once within that specified time in order to maintain the currency. 4.9.1.2.  Loss of Currency.  Place individuals non-current in one or more currency events in supervised training status for that event and declare them NMR in those unit missions requiring  that  event.    Crewmembers  are  “non-current”  the  following  calendar  day  after event currency expires (i.e. a crewmember, who accomplished a monthly currency event on 5 September, becomes non-current on 1 November). 4.9.1.2.1.  The  crewmember  cannot  deploy  and  may  not  fly  unsupervised  OCONUS until  currency  is  regained.    Loss  of  currency  prohibits  an  individual  from AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 47 accomplishing unsupervised in-flight duties in the non-current event(s).  Example:  If the  individual  is  non-current  for  tanker  air  refueling,  the  individual  may  fly unsupervised on CONUS sorties which are not scheduled for and do not accomplish tanker  air  refueling.    A  non-current  instructor  or  evaluator  may  not  instruct  or evaluate the non-current event. 4.9.1.2.2.  A  Pilot  non-current  in  Takeoff  (P010  or  P020),  Landings  (P190), Approaches  (P070),  or  Refresher  Simulator  (G261-G264)  will  not  fly  unsupervised on  any  sortie.    A  Pilot  non-current  in  Formation  (F020)  may  regain  currency  under the  supervision  of  an  IP  in  another  aircraft  of  the  formation  if  instructor  manning prevents direct IP supervision.  The optimum position for the IP is the last aircraft so they may monitor all aircraft of the formation. 4.9.1.2.3.  Flight  Surgeon  loss  of  flying  currency.    Flight  surgeons  that  exceed  60 days between sorties require a review of aircraft exits and oxygen systems conducted by a member of the flight crew designated by the Aircraft Commander (AC) prior to the flight to regain flying currency. 4.9.1.2.3.1.  The  egress  review  will  be  signed  off  by  the  AC  on  a  copy  of  the AMC/SGP  memo  or  other  approved  form  (e.g.,  AF  1522,  locally  generated form/memo,  etc.).    Note:    documentation  on  AFTO  781  is  not  acceptable.    The Flight  Surgeon  must  submit  this  documentation  to  the  local  Squadron/Host Aviation Resource Manager (SARM/HARM) office after the flight or upon return to home station if the flight is in conjunction with a TDY.  The HARM or SARM will place the documentation in the Flight Surgeon’s training folder. 4.9.1.2.3.2.  Failure to complete and document required training before the flight will result in the loss of ability to log primary Flight Surgeon time. 4.9.1.2.3.3.  Notify  the  MAJCOM/SG  when  Flight  Surgeons  fail  to  meet  semi-annual  or annual  sortie requirements.  MAJCOMs establish  procedures to  assess continued  active  flying  authorization.    Place  a  copy  of  the  MAJCOM/SG notification in the member’s flight training folder. 4.9.1.3.  Regaining Currency. 4.9.1.3.1.  Loss  of  Currency  up  to  6-Months.    Crewmembers  maintain  their  current training  level  and  no  training  folder  is  required.    Crewmember  must  demonstrate proficiency in the aircraft or WST (as appropriate) in all delinquent items while under supervision of an Air Force instructor (or ATS contract instructor when Table 4.3 or  4.4 permits regaining currency in the ATD). 4.9.1.3.2.  Loss  of  Currency  exceeding  6-Months.   Crewmember  is  declared Unqualified  for  a  loss  of  currency  exceeding  6  months  (i.e.  event  was  due  31  Dec, crew member is unqualified as of 1 Jul the following year).  For Pilots: P020, P070, P190, and R010 (only applies to those individuals who have a current Form 8 with a receiver AR qualification), Flight Engineers: M010, and Boom Operators: R120 and P300.    The  crewmember  will  complete  Sq/CC  directed  requalification  training  (and evaluation,  if  required)  according  to  AFI  11-2KC-10,  Volume  2.    For  all  other currency events, regain currency by demonstrating proficiency in the aircraft or WST 48 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 to the satisfaction of an Air Force instructor (or ATS contract instructor when Table 4.3 or  4.4 permits regaining currency in the ATD) in all delinquent items. 4.9.1.3.2.1.  Flight  Surgeons  that  exceed  6-months  between  sorties  require completion  of  LL03,  Emergency  Egress  Training,  Non-Ejection  Seat,  with  a certified aircrew instructor prior to the next flight. 4.9.2.  Failure to Complete Semi-annual Flying Training Events. 4.9.2.1.  The Sq/CC will review ARMS products at the end of each semi-annual training period.  For  individuals  who  fail  to  accomplish  training  requirements,  the  Sq/CC  will place individuals in supervised training status for the event(s) and declare them NMR in those  unit  missions  requiring  the  event(s),  or  request  an  OG/CC  waiver  for  the requirement (paragraph  1.5.8).  (T-3) 4.9.2.1.1.  If OG/CC waiver is not  accomplished,  place individuals who have failed  to  complete  semi-annual  flying  training  events  in  supervised  status  for  the  event(s) (crewmember  flies  with  an  instructor  of  like  specialty)  until  Sq/CC  directed  re-training is accomplished.  The crewmember cannot deploy or fly unsupervised (on a mission requiring the event the individual is NMR for) until Sq/CC directed retraining is accomplished.  Failure to complete semi-annual flying training events prohibits an individual from accomplishing unsupervised in-flight duties in those events. 4.9.2.1.1.1.  Individuals  who,  by  the  nature  of  their  crew  position  are  NMR,  or already  require  instructor  supervision  (i.e.  some  individuals  in  MCT,  FTL  E crewmembers) do not need to be separately placed in supervised status over and above  what  their  crew  position  or  training  program  already  confers  on  them.  Crew members in a training program who are already qualified, who have reached a  point  in  their  training  program  before  the  end  of  the  semi-annual  period  that permits  them  to  fly  unsupervised  (i.e.  FF  or  FB),  who  fall  within  the  currency window  to  revert  to  an  earlier  crew  position  (i.e.  FPK,  etc.),  or  who  are undergoing training as a result of a failed evaluation must be tracked as NMR for unit readiness purposes. 4.9.2.1.2.  Notify the MAJCOM/SG when Flight Surgeons fail to meet semi-annual or annual  sortie  requirements.  MAJCOMs  establish  procedures  to  assess  continued active  flying  authorization.  Place  a  copy  of  the  MAJCOM/SG  notification  in  the member’s flight training folder. 4.9.3.  Failure to Complete Ground Training Events. 4.9.3.1.  Individuals  who  fail  to  complete  ground  training  requirements  are  declared NMR.    The  crewmember  cannot  deploy  or  fly  unsupervised  until  currency  is  regained Exception:  Noncurrent  crewmembers  may  fly  unsupervised  on  local,  routine,  and CONUS  missions  according  to  Table  4.1  on  sorties  not  requiring  the  ground  training event. 4.9.3.1.1.  An  individual  NMR  for  failure  to  complete  Hazardous  Cargo  Training (G182)  may  fly  unsupervised  on  local  training  missions  only  with  Sq/CC  approval until training is completed. AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 49 4.9.3.2.  Waivers  for  Ground  Training  Events.    The  decision  to  grant  a  waiver  will  be based on the individual crewmember’s experience and proficiency level (i.e. waivers will not be based on a crewmember’s availability).  OG/CC will determine the allowable time period  of  the  waiver.    The  make-up  training  should  be  accomplished  at  the  earliest opportunity.   This  waiver is  for unforeseen  circumstances only  and only  for events  that will not degrade mission accomplishment.  (T-3) 4.9.4.  Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period. 4.10.  Requirements  Before  PCS  or  TDY  By  Members  On  Active  Flying  Status.

Description.  This  chapter  identifies  general  prerequisites  and  training  requirements  for upgrade.  Specific course requirements are described in the KC-10 formal course syllabi which are  located  on  the  AMC/A3TK  SharePoint:  https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/a3t/default.aspx.  AETC  also  maintains  a  list  of  formal  school  courses  at  the  Education  and  Training  Course Announcement is: https://www.my.af.mil/etcacourses/default1.asp. website. (ETCA)  The site address 5.1.1.  Wg/CC  (or  OG/CC  if  appropriately  delegated)  is  designated  waiver  authority  for minimum prerequisites for entry into upgrade programs.  (T-3) Table 5.1.  Pilot Upgrade Prerequisites. Prerequisite for Course Entry Prerequisite Before R&C Board Certification Pilot Check Out Course (PCO) or In-Unit upgrade and AC Qualification Evaluation; Mission Certification Training; MPD Phase I-III Notes 1,4 From To PIQ Graduate MP (via PCO or In-Unit upgrade) ACIQ Graduate MP (via ACIQ) NOTES: 1000 hours TFT and MPD Phase I & II Previous AC in USAF MDS and/or 1000 hours TFT; 200 PAA flying hours Mission Certification Training; Phase II guide, if required 1,2,3,4 1.  Total Flying Time (TFT) represents all flying time logged aboard a fixed wing aircraft as a military pilot including SUPT “student” and “other” time (but does not include time in another aircrew specialty or RPA time).  WST time is creditable to meet TFT requirement. 2.  Minimum of 200 KC-10 hours PAA required (does not include “other” or Phase IB) before R&C to perform AC duties.  3.  For MAF crossflow with similar skill set (i.e. KC-135, C-17, etc.), MPD Phase II guide is not required.  Pilots with dissimilar background (i.e. OSA/FAIP, F-16, etc.), accomplish MPD Phase II guide in-unit. 4.  Units should make every effort to schedule students for CNS/ATM differences course prior to start of upgrade to facilitate training on both aircraft in FTU. 5.2.  Mobility  Pilot  Development  (MPD).  Mobility  Pilot  Development  is  the  development program  leading  to  Aircraft  Commander  certification.    The  MPD  program  flows  from  Pilot Initial  Qualification  (PIQ)  or  Aircraft  Commander  Initial  Qualification  (ACIQ)  formal  training courses through continuation training to  upgrade  selection and culminates in  certification as an Aircraft  Commander.    MPD  continuation  training  is  divided  into  three  phases:  MPD  Phase  I (V280), MPD Phase II (V281), and MPD Phase III.  All MPD pilots will be dual-seat qualified AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 51 and  maintain  qualification  requirements  according  to  AFI  11-2KC-10,  Volume  2.    MPD  pilots are not Aircraft Commanders.  See minimum flying hour requirements in Table 5.1. 5.2.1.  The  success  of  this  program  depends  on  MPD  pilots  being  mentored  and  provided with  development  opportunities.    The  upgrade  training  timeline  to  Aircraft  Commander  is based  on  performance  and,  at  the  discretion  of  the  Sq/CC,  should  be  tailored  to  match  an individual’s capabilities and experience level. 5.3.  MPD Continuation Training through Aircraft Commander Upgrade. 5.3.1.  Documentation.  Completion of MPD Phase I and II is documented in ARMS via an AF 1522 as V280 and V281 respectively; GRACC is documented in ARMS via an AF 1522 as  V282.    Document  the  completion  of  the  entire  course  via  AF  Form  4324  and  Sq/CC certification accomplished in conjunction with Aircraft Commander certification. 5.3.2.  Training  Guides.  MPD  Phase  I  &  II  guides  are  available  for  download  on  the AMC/A3T  SharePoint.    Guides  should  be  carried  on  all  sorties  to  maximize  training opportunities. 5.3.3.  MPD Phase I (V280).  After completion of the PIQ course, pilots enter MPD Phase I of  continuation  training.    This  first  phase  consists  of  completing  the  MPD  Phase  I  guide, which  focuses  on  core  aircraft  abilities  including  communication,  checklist  discipline, systems  knowledge,  and  basic  mission  planning.    A  Phase  I  MPD  pilot  should  not  have additional squadron duties nor be expected to act as an Aircraft Commander, yet they should observe and learn from their aircrew leadership. 5.3.3.1.  During this stage of pilot development, a  Phase I MPD pilot is restricted to the right seat and may only occupy the aircraft left seat with an IP.  Phase I MPD pilots will train  in  the  right  seat  during  refresher  WSTs  and  may  occupy  the  left  or  right  seats  for proficiency WSTs (and available proficiency time at the end of a refresher WST).  Phase I MPD pilots will complete the MPD Phase I guide NLT 180 days (365 days for ARC) after becoming mission ready. 5.3.3.2.  In  order  to  advance  beyond  MPD  Phase  I,  the  pilot  must  be  at  least  6  months from  the  training  start  date  (as  defined  in  paragraph    1.7.1),  have  a  minimum  of  200 PAA  (aircraft)  hours,  and  have  completed  the  MPD  Phase  I  guide.    Once  these requirements are met, the Phase I MPD pilot may be approved for MPD Phase II via the STRP  and  in  no  case,  no  later  than  selection  for  Aircraft  Commander  upgrade.    For FAIP/OSA  or  non-mobility  weapon  system  pilots  transitioning  to  MAF  aircraft, completion of V280 is not required; however, V281 and V282 are required. 5.3.3.3.  Receiver AR training for MPD pilots may be accomplished anytime with an IP (as  long  as  passengers  are  not  on-board)  IAW  AFI  11-2KC-10,  Volume  3,  Chapter  9 training restrictions.  MPD pilots may be entered into a certification program  IAW AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 1, paragraph 5.6.7.  MPD pilots should be certified in Q583, MPD Receiver Air Refueling,  prior to  entering PCO.  This  refueling may be accomplished in either seat. 5.3.4.  MPD  Phase  II  (V281).  This phase consists of completing the MPD Phase II guide, which  focuses  on  the  core  tasks  of  flying  skills,  mission  situational  awareness,  and  crew management required for Aircraft Commander certification. 52 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 5.3.4.1.  Training in this stage will ensure a balanced exposure to both left and right seats in the aircraft with an AC or above.  Good judgment and Operational Risk Management (ORM)  will  dictate  with  whom  they  fly  and  what  seat  they  occupy.    As  Phase  II  MPD pilots advance in knowledge, they are encouraged to practice actual mission management skills and decision making under the guidance of their AC or IP. 5.3.4.2.  MPD Selection for Aircraft Commander Upgrade/Certification.  MPD pilots must meet prerequisites defined in Table 5.1 as well as complete the MPD Phase II guide prior  to  starting  Pilot  Checkout  course.    Based  upon  performance,  experience,  and requisite  flight  hours,  Phase  II  MPD  pilots  will  be  identified  for  upgrade  by  squadron leadership via the STRP.   Selection for Phase II and Aircraft Commander upgrade may be  concurrent.    Additionally,  MPD  pilots  require  a  minimum  of  one  AF  Form  8 evaluation  after  FP  mission  ready  certification  and  prior  to  entry  into  Aircraft Commander  upgrade  (N/A  for  MAF  crossflow,  FAIP/OSA,  or  non-  mobility  weapon system pilots). 5.3.4.3.  AMC  Orientation  Tour  /  GRACC  (V282).  This  event  provides  an  in-depth look  at  selected  AMC  and  618  AOC  (TACC)  operations  as  well  as  an  opportunity  to interact with command senior staff.  Ideally, this course should be completed by Aircraft Commander  candidates  after  completing  V281,  but  before  beginning  formal  Aircraft Commander upgrade training (ACU or PCO).  GRACC is mandatory for AMC pilots and highly  encouraged  for  PACAF,  USAFE,  AFRC,  and  ANG  mobility  forces  pilots upgrading to Aircraft Commander.  GRACC is transferable between all mobility weapon systems.    For  AMC  pilots,  V282  will  be  completed  prior  to  Aircraft  Commander certification.    If  unable  to  complete  V282  prior  to  certification,  units  may  schedule attendance  up  to  90  days  after  certification;  beyond  90  days  requires  OG/CC  approval.  See paragraph  1.18.2 for details.  Additional information is available via ETCA.  (T-3) 5.3.5.  MPD Phase III.  Pilot Checkout (PCO).  After the Sq/CC determines (via the STRP) an  upgrade  training  start  date,  training  time  begins  and  the  upgrade  candidate  will  begin applicable  PCO  training  events,  as  required  (see  Table  1.2  for  training  time  limitations).  Prior to  starting training, the training office will open and maintain an AF Form  4022 until the upgrade candidate is certified as an Aircraft Commander.  Units using multiple folders to document  a  pilots  training  progress  may  combine  those  into  a  single  training  folder  at  the unit’s discretion.  Training guides are authorized.  Note: Phase III refers to in-unit upgrade to aircraft commander and does not apply to students going through the formal PCO course at a KC-10 FTU.  FTU training time starts on the published Class Start Date (CSD). 5.3.5.1.  Current  and  qualified  Aircraft  Commander  candidates  accomplishing  MPD Phase  III  training  events  require  IP  supervision  during  non-critical  phases  of  flight  and direct  IP  supervision  during  critical  phases  of  flight  (see  course  syllabi  for  exceptions).  Two  Aircraft  Commander  candidates  may  sit  in  the  left  and  right  seats  under  IP supervision in the simulator, as required. 5.3.5.2.  The Aircraft Commander candidate will accomplish the following requirements prior to the Aircraft Commander Review and Certification (R&C) Board: 5.3.5.2.1.  The  preferred  method  for  completing  Aircraft  Commander  upgrade training  is  by  completion  of  the  Pilot  Check  Out  (PCO)  Course  conducted  by  the contractor  followed  by  flightline  training  conducted  by  the  Formal  Training  Unit AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 53 (FTU).    Contractor  training  covers  emergency  procedures,  tactics,  and  Aircraft Commander  duties.    FTU  training  completes  air  refueling  training.    Units  retain  the option  to  conduct  in-unit  Aircraft  Commander  upgrades  without  waiver  for  highly qualified and experienced pilots. 5.3.5.2.2.  Aircraft  Commander  candidates  must  be  current  in  applicable  Mission Certification Training events prior to certification. 5.3.6.  Evaluation  and  Certification.  Prior  to  certification,  the  upgrade  candidate  must demonstrate  aircraft  commander  proficiency  during  an  Aircraft  Commander  flight evaluation,  to  include  receiver  air  refueling  IAW  AFI  11-2KC-10,  Volume  2.    PCO culminates with a Sq/CC’s R&C Board recommendation. 5.3.7.  Aircrew  Designation  Codes.  Mobility pilot designation codes are IAW AFI 11-401 AMCSUP I, Aviation Management, AMC pilot designation codes.  During Phase IB training, pilots will log “UP” time (except PCO and IAC students).

Total Flying Time (TFT) represents all flying time logged aboard a fixed wing aircraft as a military pilot including UPT “student” and “other” time (but does not include time in another aircrew specialty).  WST time is creditable to meet TFT requirement. 2.  Instructor Flight Engineer candidates with total flying hours logged from other than the Flight Engineer crew position (i.e. Boom Operator, Loadmaster) require 2000 total flying hours and 750 hours as a KC-10 Flight Engineer prior to consideration for upgrade. 3.  Instructor Boom Operator candidates with total flying hours logged from other than the 54 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 Boom Operator crew position (i.e. Flight Engineer, Loadmaster) require 2000 Total flying hours and 750 hours as a KC-10 Boom Operator prior to consideration for upgrade. 5.4.  Aircrew Instructor Program.  Instructor candidates will be selected based on experience, judgment,  ability  to  instruct,  flying  skill,  and  technical  knowledge.    For  specific  instructor upgrade prerequisites, see Table 5.2. 5.4.1.  Instructor candidates, who are current and qualified in the aircraft, previously attended a  formal  instructor  school  for  instructor  qualification,  were  qualified  instructors  in  any  US Air Force aircraft, and who meet the minimum flying hour requirements may upgrade in-unit with  OG/CC  approval.    MAJCOM  waiver  is  not  required.    Sq/CC  will  determine  training required to complete the instructor upgrade in-unit, including evaluation, IAW AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 2.  (T-3) Table 5.3.

Flight Examiner Certification.  Flight examiner prerequisites are in Table 5.3. 5.5.1.  Sq/CC  will  recommend  instructors  for  flight  examiner  certification.    Instructors identified  for  certification  as  flight  examiners  must  possess  satisfactory  knowledge  of training,  evaluation  policies  and  procedures,  and  the  ability  to  administer  evaluations according to applicable publications.  Flight examiner candidates will: 5.5.1.1.  Observe  qualified  examiners  conducting  a  cross-section  of  evaluations,  to include techniques used to evaluate aircraft systems and flight directive knowledge. 5.5.1.2.  Demonstrate  comprehensive  knowledge  and  application  of  command  policies, AFI  11-202,  Volumes  1  and  2,  AFI  11-2KC-10,  Volumes  1  and  2,  and  MAJCOM supplements. 5.6.  Special  Qualifications  and  Certifications:  Certain  KC-10  aircrew  qualifications  and certifications are one-time events trained after completion of formal qualification Exception: see paragraph  2.9.2.  Special qualifications and certifications may  require an evaluation  or an  AF Form 4324 update.  These programs are usually taught at the unit level by Air Force instructors of like specialty. 5.6.1.  EMCON Options 3 and 4 Certification Training (N013 & N014): AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 55 5.6.1.1.  Sq/CC  will  certify  crewmembers  to  accomplish  EMCON  3  or  4  procedures during  formation,  rendezvous,  and  AR  on  both  operational  and  training  sorties.    All members  of  the  crew  must  be  certified  or  in  training  under  the  supervision  of  a  like specialty instructor.  Thorough coordination with the receiver aircrew is required for units to practice EMCON 3 or 4 on non-operational training missions.  Coordination should be accomplished  during  mission  planning  phase.    In  no  case  will  a  crew  launch  under EMCON  3  or  4  without  prior  coordination  with  the  receiver  crew.    Document certification via AF Form 4324 as EMCON 3-Certified and EMCON 4-Certified.  ARMS event identifiers are N013 and N014.  Accomplishment during Phase IB is creditable for this certification. 5.6.1.2.  Training  Program.    Unit  Sq/CC  will  determine  training  requirements  based  on the crewmember’s experience and the unit's mission.  Boom Operators with less than 200 flying hours must receive a minimum of one flight with an instructor stressing radio silent procedures before certification.  Units will include details of the EMCON Option 3 and 4 programs in local supplement. 5.6.2.  Formation Lead Certification (Q011): 5.6.2.1.

The  squadron  commander  is  responsible  for  developing  a  large  formation certification training program for all pilots.  This certification must include a minimum of one flight flown under supervision of an instructor pilot.  If instructor manning prevents placing  IPs  in  all  aircraft,  units  may  place  an  IP  in  one  aircraft  in  the  formation.    The optimum  is  the  last  aircraft  so  that  the  IP  may  monitor  all  aircraft  of  the  formation.  Commanders of deployed units or tanker task force (TTF) commanders may certify TDY crew members and will forward certification paperwork to the crew member’s home unit for filing in the member’s training folders.  Requires pre-coordination with all formation participants and associated AR support.  MPD pilots that were previously certified are not required  to  be  re-certified  following  PCO.    Accomplishment  during  Phase  IB  is  only creditable  towards  certification  if  specifically  documented  on  the  AF  Form  4025.  Document  the  certification  via  AF  Form  4324.    ARMS  event  identifier  is  Q580,  Large Formation Certification. 5.6.12.  Phoenix  Banner,  Silver  and  Copper  Certification  (Q544)  :  Sq/CCs will identify their most highly qualified crewmembers for entry into certification training.  Training will focus  on  the  unique  circumstances  that  differentiate  this  mission  from  other  mobility missions.  Document the certification via  AF  Form  4324.  ARMS event  identifier is  Q544, Phoenix Banner, Silver and Copper Certification. 5.6.12.1.  Wings  will  establish  and  maintain  Phoenix  Banner  training  programs.    As  a minimum,  training  will  consist  of  an  instructor-led  in-depth  review  of  AFI  11-289, Phoenix  Banner,  Silver,  and  Copper  Operations,  discussion  of  tasking  and  execution agencies  for  Phoenix  Banner  missions,  and  how  the  aircrew  will  interface  with  these agencies.  Furthermore, the program will address the personnel to coordinate with, in case of diversion or delay, including the Presidential Advance Agent, US Secret Service, and HMX-1  representative.    The  goal  of  training  is  to  educate  crewmembers  on  the requirements for these individuals/agencies and illustrate their ability to help accomplish the mission.  Following the review, an open book examination of AFI 11-289, minimum passing score of 80 percent, corrected to 100 percent will be accomplished.  All aircrew members will complete the training program and be certified prior to flying unsupervised on a PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, or COPPER mission. 58 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 Chapter 6 AIRCREW TRAINING SYSTEM (ATS) 6.1.  Description.  The  KC-10  ATS  is  a  civilian  contractor-provided  aircrew  training  system.  The  ATS  contractor  provides  training  courseware  and  all  academic  and  ATD  instruction.    The Air  Force  conducts  all  flight  training  and  administers  all  evaluations.    The  ATS  contract guarantees trained students meet government standards.  Formal ATS courses are listed in Table 6.2 and non-formal ATS courses are listed in Table 6.3. 6.2.  Applicability.  As defined in AFI 11-202, Volume 1. 6.2.1.  Purpose.    KC-10  ATS  is  a  system  of  academics,  ATD  sessions,  and  ground  training phases.  This system provides qualification, requalification, upgrade, senior staff, differences, and  continuation  training  to  attain  and  maintain  appropriate  qualification  for  KC-10 crewmembers and maintenance engine run technicians.  6.2.2.  Goal.    The  goal  of  the  ATS  program  is  to  optimize  aircrew  training  through  the integrated  use  of  academics,  ATD,  and  flight  line  KC-10  aircraft  instruction.    The  KC-10 ATS,  by  contract,  establishes  performance  requirements  in  the  ATS  Statement  of  Work (SOW) and system specification. 6.2.3.  Responsibilities: 6.2.3.1.  ATS Contractor. 6.2.3.1.1.  Each  ATS  site  will  provide  academic  and  ATD  training  for  KC-10 crewmember  qualification,  requalification,  upgrade,  senior  staff,  differences,  and continuation training programs to meet course objectives. 6.2.3.2.  AMC/A3T. 6.2.3.2.1.  Provide overall management authority for KC-10 contract training. 6.2.3.2.2.  Act as AMC focal point for review of all recommended initiatives directed toward  the  KC-10  training  contract.    This  includes  recommendations  for  changes submitted by contractor or other Air Force agencies. 6.2.3.2.3.  Ensure  instruction  is  of  the  highest  quality  through  the  review  of crewmember surveys, instructor/examiner feedback, FTU feedback, and through their own evaluations. 6.2.3.3.

Close coordination with the formal school  quota  manager  (AMC/A3TK  or  A3TF)  is  imperative  to  ensure  effective utilization of training slots and contractor resources. 6.3.  Dedicated Training Time.  As defined in AFI 11-202, Volume 1, paragraph 5.2. 6.3.1.  It is imperative that students complete training in a timely and uninterrupted manner.  Students  will  enroll  on  a  full-time  basis  (AFRC  students  will  be  available  for  the  entire ground and simulator phases, but do not need, though highly encouraged, to be on a full-time basis for the flight phase).  Students will be relieved of duties not directly related to training.  Exception: Supervisory personnel may continue their normal duties as time permits. 6.4.  ATS Course Prerequisites.  ATS course prerequisites are listed in Table 5.1,  5.3, and 6.1.  Each ATS course is  designed and based on  student prerequisites being met.   Prerequisites may include  a  minimum  number  of  flying  hours,  squadron  operations  officer  recommendation,  and completion of applicable training guides.  AETC maintains a list of formal school courses on the Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) website. Table 6.1.  Initial Qualification Training Prerequisites.

This course is archived for future reference/use and are not updated nor maintained by the ATS contractor.  They can be updated for use following AMC/A3TK notification to the contractor.  2.  This training is Computer Based Training. 3.  CRM training is developed in accordance with AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program.  Training is included in the requisite Initial Qualification, Instructor Qualification, and Refresher courses. 4.  Course designed to teach KC-10 qualified instructors and evaluators to operate devices (WST and FTDs for IPs/IFEs, BOT for IBOs). 6.5.  Lesson  Objectives.  Contractor-developed  lesson  objectives  are  based  on  requirements  in this instruction. 6.5.1.  General.  The training contractor will provide KC-10 aircrew members with  ground-based  training  required  to  meet  syllabus  objectives  for  initial  qualification,  requalification, upgrade, senior staff, differences, and continuation training. 6.5.2.  Objective.    Ensure  all  aircrews  maintain  proficiency  required  to  safely  operate  the aircraft  and  effectively  perform  the  assigned  mission.    Crewmembers  will  utilize  training devices to enhance training areas that ATDs are particularity well suited to accomplish (e.g., wind  shear  and  microburst  training,  low  visibility  approaches,  systems  knowledge, emergency and abnormal procedures, etc.). 6.5.3.  Crew  Resource  Management  (CRM)  training.    The  KC-10  ATS  incorporates  CRM principles  during  all  phases  of  training  including  initial  and  continuation  training  to  meet requirements  of  AFI  11-290.    Instructors  use  AF  Form  4031,  CRM  Skills  Criteria Training/Evaluation as prescribed in AFI 11-290, for CRM skills training. 6.6.  Unsatisfactory  Student  Progress.  If  a  student's  training  progress  is  unsatisfactory,  the contractor  will  notify  the  student’s  squadron  commander.    Following  a  review  of  the  student's record, the government (Sq/CC, OSS/OST, Det 1, COR) will determine whether to continue or terminate training. 6.6.1.  The contractor will provide written feedback to the student’s gaining unit commander or training office for students who display substandard performance. 6.6.2.  Remediation  Procedures.    ATS  contractor,  COR,  AMCAOS  Det  1,  and  HQ AMC/A3TK  must  receive  prompt  notification  of  failed  flight  evaluations  culminating  an ATS  course.    Local  procedures  must  ensure  notification  is  completed  within  24  hours  of failure for local  evaluations and within 24 hours after return to  home station for off-station evaluations.    Remediation  subsequent  to  a  failed  flight  evaluation  may  be  the  ATS contractor’s responsibility, Air Force’s responsibility, or a joint responsibility, depending on the  nature  of  failure.    In  every  case,  close  coordination  is  required  to  achieve  maximum trainee progress.  Direct contact with appropriate ATS instructor supervisor is encouraged. 6.6.2.1.  Remediation Scheduling: 64 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 6.6.2.1.1.  When  a  trainee  is  required  to  return  for  remediation  regarding  deficient areas, the trainee’s unit, appropriate wing or group training office, and ATS training manager will coordinate training start and completion dates. 6.6.2.1.2.  The  ATS  contractor  will  contact  the  trainee’s  squadron  commander  if  a trainee  is  identified,  during  ATS  contractor’s  instruction,  to  need  remediation  or additional  training.    If  the  ATS  contractor  determines  no  further  amount  of remediation  or  additional  instruction  will  result  in  the  individual  attaining  required proficiency  level,  the  contractor  will  expeditiously  inform  the  trainee’s  squadron commander  verbally  and  follow-up  in  writing.    As  a  minimum,  the  Air  Force  ATS COR will receive a courtesy copy of this documentation.  Following a review of the student's record, the government (Sq/CC, OSS/OST, Det 1 AMCAOS, and COR) will determine whether to continue or terminate training. 6.7.  Courseware  Changes.  Changes  to  ATS  courseware  may  be  proposed  by  any  KC-10 crewmember.    Complete  recommended  change  on  ATS  contractor’s  change  proposal  form  and submit to the local COR.  Change proposals will be sent through wing or group training and ATS COR offices to  Det  1 AMCAOS.  Det  1 AMCAOS  will coordinate with  HQ AMC/A3TK, the ATS contractor, and the originator to provide feedback to reflect action taken.  Change proposal forms are available from ATS contractor site manager at each site. 6.8.  Scheduling: 6.8.1.  AMC/A3T Responsibilities: 6.8.1.1.  Submit the following fiscal year’s student training requirements to the contractor no later than 28 February of the current year. 6.8.1.2.  Publish  and  distribute  the  next  fiscal  year’s  annual  programmed  flying  training (PFT) schedule no later than 1 June of the current year. 6.8.1.3.  Coordinate  changes  to  the  current  PFT  with  the  KC-10  program  management team and the contractor and then distribute those changes. 6.8.2.  Contractor  Responsibilities:  (These  reports  are  exempt  from  Office  of  Management and Budget review in accordance with Public Law 96-511, The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended, Title 44, United States Code, Chapter 35.) 6.8.2.1.  Develop  and  submit  the  following  year’s  PFT  to  AMC/A3TF  no  later  than  15 April of the current year. 6.8.2.1.1.  Notify  AMC/A3TF  and  A3TK  prior  to  15  April  of  the  current  year  for resolution  if  yearly  PFT  request  received  by  the  contractor  exceeds  contracted  PFT baselines  from  either  the  overall  PFT  numbers  requested  or  due  to  contractor limitations. 6.8.2.2.  Provide  units  with  a  quarterly  pilot,  FE,  and  BO  refresher  and  Additional Training  Time  (ATT)  schedule  no  later  than  45  days  prior  to  the  start  of  the  following quarter.    The  contractor  will  fill  any  vacancies  in  each  quarter’s  draft  WST  and  BOT schedule with ATT periods.  The goal is to ensure the squadrons have the opportunity to use  100%  of  available  WST  time  as  long  as  the  contracted  ATT  throughput  is  not exceeded.  This means the contractor should not leave an available period unscheduled in AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 65 the draft schedule due to lack of instructor availability.  The training facility manager and all local KC-10 squadrons will establish mutually agreeable scheduling procedures. 6.8.3.  OG/CC OPR (AFRC/A3TA) Responsibilities: 6.8.3.1.  No later than the last week in November of each year, provide AMC/A3TF with estimated  training  requirements  (initial  qualification,  requalification,  upgrade,  senior staff, ATD refreshers, engine run, and additional simulator training time) of their units for the next fiscal year. 6.8.3.2.  Coordinate  with  AMC/A3TF  when  additional  training  slots  are  required.  Additional requirements for training slots will be thoroughly justified. 6.8.3.3.  Provide  Wing  Formal  Training  with  either  a  form  letter  or  an  annotated  class roster indicating the date and names of crewmembers completing their evaluation. 6.8.4.  Unit Responsibilities: 6.8.4.1.  No  later  than  the  last  week  in  October  of  each  year,  provide  OG/CC (AFRC/A3TA  for  AFRC  units)  with  the  estimated  training  requirements  (initial qualification, requalification, upgrade, ATD refreshers, and additional simulator training time) of their units for the next fiscal year. 6.8.4.2.  When  filling  initial,  requalification,  and  upgrade  course  allocations,  ensure allocation RIPs are sent to the unit MPS with the minimum: course, class number, grade, name,  and  SSN  of  the  individual  scheduled  for  training.    Crewmembers  are  to  be reminded to receive an ADSC briefing by MPS prior to attending training (N/A AFRC).  When training involves TDY, it is unit funded.  In this case, units must provide fundcite to the applicable MPS. 6.8.4.3.  No later than 45 days prior to the class start date, units must inform AMC/A3TF (AFRC/DPTF  for  AFRC  units)  and  MPS  or  DPMPC  with  class  number,  name,  and  a SSN of personnel attending. 6.8.4.3.1.  AMC/A3TF  will  forward  this  information  to  contractor  site  managers  at the  beginning  of  every  month.    The  contractor  site  manager  will  compare  the AMC/A3TF  list  to  the  PFT  to  ensure  every  course  on  the  AMC/A3TF  list  has  the same number of students as the PFT.  On the first day of class, the contractor will also ensure only the students designated on the AMC/A3TF list are trained.  If no student or the wrong student attends the class, the contractor will coordinate with the unit and AMC/A3TF to correct the problem. 6.8.4.4.  Thirty  (30)  days  prior  to  the  start  of  a  new  quarter,  all  units  must  notify AMC/A3TF of all allocations they do not plan to use during that quarter. 6.8.4.5.  AMC/A3TF makes unused allocations available to other units.  Normally, AMC allocated slots remain AMC slots until relinquished by AMC/A3TF.  Conversely, AFRC slots remain AFRC slots until relinquished by AFRC/A3TA. 6.8.4.6.  Units desiring to trade quotas may do so without AMC headquarters’ approval; however, they must inform AMC/A3TF and all appropriate agencies and units. 6.8.4.7.  Requests for additional training quotas will be submitted directly to AMC/A3TF with  information  copies  to  OG/CC and  AFRC/A3TA (if applicable).    AMC/A3TF will 66 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 take required action and inform applicable command formal training (DPPET-AMC and DPTF-AFRC) of any new authorized classes. training refresher  and  additional 6.8.4.8.  Coordinate  aircrew time  scheduling requirements  with  the  applicable  training  facility.    The  unit  will  work  with  the  training facility manager to establish mutually agreeable and effective scheduling procedures.  As a  minimum,  in  accordance  with  the  contract,  the  contractor  will  provide  next  quarter’s schedule to the units 45 days prior to the start of the quarter.  Units will designate which unit will use each training period and cancel any training that is not needed.  Units will then return the schedule with squadron assignment no later than 20 days prior to the start of  the  quarter.    Each  RegAF  and  AFRC  associate  unit  will  coordinate  closely  when scheduling ATD training.  Training slots that cannot be filled by one unit must be offered to other units in a timely manner.  Training slots should not go unfilled unless absolutely unavoidable. 6.8.4.9.  Ensure the training contractor is kept apprised of scheduling changes or training requirements.  The contractor should be provided as much advance notice as practical. 6.8.4.10.  When  practical,  the  contractor  will  schedule  one  ATT  per  week  per  RegAF squadron.    These  ATTs  will  be  scheduled  so  they  may  be  used  for  crewmember evaluations on the third consecutive day following a two-day refresher.  Intent is to move RegAF  simulator  evaluations  out  of  quarterly  refresher  periods  and  into  ATT  simulator periods. 6.8.4.11.  When  practical,  squadrons  will  use  these  ATT  periods  to  schedule  RegAF recurring  simulator  evaluations.    If  practical,  try  to  schedule  more  than  one  evaluation during  the  same  ATT,  i.e.  a  pilot  and  flight  engineer  who  are  both  in  their  eligibility window.  Units should also strive to maintain crew integrity throughout the 3-day period. 6.8.4.12.  Squadron  schedulers  will  notify  the  contractor  training  administrator  with  the names of the students  for refresher ATD periods.  The squadron scheduler may  replace individuals to meet mission requirements.  If the squadron cannot fill the training session with  a  full  crew,  the  contractor  must  be  notified  of  the  cancellation  by  1600  Local,  the work day prior to the scheduled training.  When the squadron does not fill the scheduled training  session  and  does  not  notify  the  contractor  administrator  of  a  cancellation,  this constitutes  a  "no-show."    No-shows  are  submitted  to  AMC  on  the  contractor  monthly throughput report.  Det  1 AMCAOS will notify squadron Director of Operations of any "no-shows" incurred by the squadron. 6.8.5.  Simulator Tours: See paragraph 6.13. 6.9.  Administration: 6.9.1.  ATS Feedback. 6.9.1.1.  Air Force-appointed ATS CORs are primary focal points and the liaison agency between the Air Force and the ATS contractor.  CORs are the only Air Force personnel empowered  to  evaluate  any  component  of  contract  compliance.    These  individuals  are entrusted  with  quality  assurance,  are  the  only  appropriate  office  (unit-level)  to  direct contractor to perform or stop work via the Administrative Contracting Officer's (ACO) or Procurement Contracting Officer's (PCO) direction, and are accountable for these actions.  AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 67 Each  wing  or  group  commander  will  establish  ATS  CORs  positions  and  enforce directives,  requirements,  and  procedures  established  by  DoD  and  MAJCOM  directives and  publications.    ATS  CORs  must  maintain  a  current  copy  of  the  ATS  contract(s), designated quality assurance regulations and directives, and quality assurance procedures. 6.9.1.2.  Operational  Evaluation.    The  ATS  contractor  is  required  to  evaluate  the  ATS program  (both  formal  and  non-formal)  and  its  graduates’  on-the-job  performance  as stated in the contract. 6.9.1.3.  Feedback  includes  inputs  from  graduates,  flight  commanders  (or  designated representatives), and examiners.  Analysis of actual  performance (Air  Force  evaluation) and  trainee  critique  data  help  to  determine  if  graduates’  on-the-job  performance  meets MTL  and  established  performance  standards.    The  importance  of  this  on-the-job performance  feedback  from  graduates,  flight  commanders,  and  examiners  cannot  be overemphasized.    This  data  is  vital  to  establishing  a  database  to  identify  trends  and support revisions to the ATS. 6.9.2.  ATS  Data  Collection.    Internal  and  external  data  will  be  collected,  reported,  and corrective actions taken according to approved operation evaluation plan. 6.10.  Training Implementation/Student Expectation: 6.10.1.  Crew  Member  Preparation.    The  crew  member  is  responsible  for  adequate preparation prior to reporting for each ATD mission.  This includes a review of the mission profiles,  pre-course  study  material,  all  associated  normal,  abnormal,  and  emergency procedures,  and  applicable  aircraft  systems.    Aircraft  Systems  Refresher  CBTs  (G220)  will be  accomplished  by  the  Flight  Engineer  and  Boom  Operator  during  the  quarter  for  those systems topics IAW Table 4.1 6.10.2.  Mission  Pre-Briefing.    Prior  to  each  ATD  mission,  the  instructor  will  brief  crew members  on  mission  objectives,  specific  training  items  to  be  accomplished,  scheduled systems  and  performance  training,  crew  resource  management,  and  any  additional  area  of emphasis.    The  briefing  should  include  data  and  information  necessary  to  complete  the mission, special procedures, and aircraft systems.  The information presented in the briefing should  correlate  to  the  tasks  to  be  reinforced  in  the  training  device.    It  should  include  any changes  or  adjustments  to  pre-positioned  data  and  a  review  of  the  overall  mission  and coordination  of  individual  crewmember  responsibilities.    Prior  to  executing  the  scheduled training event, a designated crewmember should conduct a mission briefing covering AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 3 briefing items. 6.10.3.  Mission  Debrief.    Following  ATD  missions,  all  aspects  of  the  mission  will  be discussed. Emphasis will be placed on all observed weak areas.  The crew is required to enter maintenance  discrepancies  in  the  AFTO  Form  781,  ARMS  Aircrew/Mission  Flight  Data Document  prescribed  by  T.O.  00-20-1,  Aerospace  Equipment  Maintenance  Inspection, Documentation, Policy and Procedures and debrief the maintenance technician. 6.11.  Browsing  Training  Products.  KC-10  crewmembers  and  engine-run  personnel  are encouraged  to  browse  any  and  all  lessons,  guides,  and  material  within  the  ATS.    This  is particularly  appropriate  to  those  crewmembers  preparing  to  enter  upgrade  courses.    Use  the following guidelines: 68 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 6.11.1.  Browser time is on a space-available basis. 6.11.2.  Coordinate browser requests with the local ATS site manager. 6.11.3.  Trainees  are  not  to  be  scheduled  to  browse  lessons  for  remediation.    Remediation will  be  scheduled  by  coordinating  with  the  ATS  contractor.    Browsing  a  lesson  does  not enable the trainee to take the end-of-lesson test.  Trainees in remediation will be enrolled in lessons for review in order to take the end-of-lesson test and keep a permanent record of the remediation. 6.12.  Aircraft Flights for ATS Training Instructors. 6.12.1.  ATS Contractor Personnel Flight Operations.  ATS Training Instructors observe in-flight  operations  according  to  AFI  11-401  and  the  KC-10  ATS  contract.    Flights  will  be accomplished according to the terms and conditions of a current government contract.  ATS contract instructors who observe local missions (defined as training missions originating and returning  to  home  station)  may  observe  the  mission  in  Mission  Essential  Personnel  (MEP) status.    ATS  contract  instructors  are  authorized  (at  the  Aircraft  Commander's  discretion)  to occupy the flight deck during any phase of flight.  As MEPs, ATS contract instructors may observe  all  portions  of  KC-10  training  missions  to  include  tactical  maneuvers,  receiver  air refueling, tanker air refueling, touch-and-go landings, and full stop taxi back landings.  ATS contract  instructors  are  not  authorized  access  to  flight  controls  nor  shall  they  occupy  a primary crew position.  Units detail local requirements in a supplement to this AFI. 6.12.1.1.  ATS contractor instructors are required to fly a minimum of one time per year, subject to OG/CC concurrence and the ATS contract. 6.13.  ATS Facility Tours. 6.13.1.  Wing training offices will coordinate all requests for KC-10 ATS facility tours with the contractor as soon as possible, but at least 24 hours in advance to ensure the tour will not impact simulator maintenance or training.  Training will not be affected to meet a tour time and tours requiring whole periods or a significant part of simulator periods will typically not be  supported.    The  fifteen-minute  break  during  each  WST  is  the  most  opportune  time  to accomplish an orientation without adversely affecting training. 6.13.2.  Facility  tours  may  require  close  coordination  with  public  affairs  and  protocol.    Air Force  option  time  may  be  used  at  the  discretion  of  the  OG/CC.    Tours  will  be  on  an  as-available basis and will not displace scheduled training events. 6.13.3.  OG/CC  will  ensure  an  Air  Force  representative  meets,  greets,  accompanies,  and conducts all tours.  The contractor is not manned for or on contract to perform these duties.  The contractor shall be responsible for providing an aircrew training device operator only. 6.14.  Aircrew Evaluation: 6.14.1.  General.    The  decision  of  the  Air  Force  examiner  as  to  the  ability  of  the  aircrew member to meet qualification levels as set forth in AFI 11-202, Volume 2, shall be final and will not  be subject  to  question by  the  contractor.  An AF Form  8 will be completed  for all initial  and  recurring  simulator  evaluations.    Less  than  qualified  performance  will  be documented as Qualification Level 3. AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 69 6.14.1.1.  Initial Qualification Evaluations.  Prior to commencing Phase IB flight training in  the KC-10, each  crew member will be administered an  evaluation  (Q005 or Q006 as appropriate) in the applicable ATD; evaluation will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of  contractor  training  as  well  as  the  capabilities  and  proficiency  of  the  student.    Each initial  qualification  (IQ)  training  device  evaluation  shall  be  conducted  using  either contractor-developed  (and  Air  Force  approved)  mission  scenarios  or  local  unit standardization-evaluation (Stan/Eval) developed scenarios. Exception:  Boom operators evaluations will be conducted using contractor developed (Air Force approved) scenarios.  For  unit  developed  profiles,  the  examiner  must  coordinate  with  the  contractor,  at  a minimum, one day prior to the evaluation and ensure it is compatible with ATD software. Exception:  If using a standard local profile, coordination must be accomplished prior to the  simulator  period.    In  the  event  of  an  unqualified  rating  (ATD  or  in-flight),  a Qualification Level 3 AF Form 8 is issued to document the unqualified performance and the  contractor  is  responsible  for  all  retraining  (ground-based)  in  those  phases  and  sub-phases determined to be under the direct control of the contractor.  A joint contractor and Air  Force  review  board  consisting  of  crew  specialty  representatives  from  Group  level training,  FTU  (if  an  in-flight  evaluation),  Group  and/or  Squadron  Stan/Eval  and appropriate  contractor  personnel  will  review  the  aircrew  member’s  performance  and determine  those  phases  of  the  ground  based  courses  that  require  additional  training  to meet qualification levels. 6.14.1.2.  Recurring Evaluations.  Recurring ATD evaluations will be given using either contractor-developed  refresher  profiles,  evaluation  profiles,  or  Air  Force  examiner provided  profiles.    Exception:    Boom  operators  evaluations  will  be  conducted  using contractor  developed  (Air  Force  approved)  scenarios.    For  unit  developed  profiles,  the examiner  must  coordinate  with  the  contractor,  at  a  minimum,  one  day  prior  to  the evaluation  and  ensure  it  is  compatible  with  ATD  software.    Exception:    if  using  a standard local  profile, coordination  must be  accomplished prior to  the simulator period.  In the event  of an evaluation  failure (in-flight  or ATD), the appropriate  ATD should be used  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  for  retraining  and  rechecks.    Usually,  additional training and rechecks will be accomplished during a unit’s scheduled ATT periods.  In all cases,  the  unit  must  coordinate  with  the  training  contractor  for  ATD  or  instructor availability.    In  some  cases,  it  may  be  necessary  to  cancel  or  reschedule  training  to accomplish the desired corrective actions. 70 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 Chapter 7 ARMS EVENT IDENTIFIERS AND COURSE DESCRIPTIONS 7.1.

Specific training  accomplished  must  be annotated on a MAR, (See Chapter 4 for training events that can be accomplished or logged in  ATDs).  Contractor-administered  simulator  refresher  courses  (KC-10  PFREF)  of instruction  for  aircraft  commanders,  pilots,  and  Flight  Engineers.    Consists  of  two  WST periods per quarter (each period consist of: 2.0 hours pre-brief, 4.0 hour WST period, and 1.0 hour  de-brief)  emphasizing  crew  coordination,  normal,  abnormal,  emergency  procedures, aircraft performance, as well as aircraft systems.  Det 1-approved quarterly refresher profiles will  include,  as  a  minimum,  the  abnormal  and  emergency  procedures  listed  in  paragraph 7.9.23.1  and    7.9.23.2  below.    Det  1  may  substitute/delete  single  items  on  the  list  once  per year to accommodate emphasis items or for accomplishing abnormal/emergency procedures requiring additional time.  Depending on device availability, one FTD and one WST may be used in Det 1 approved profiles.  Day two in the WST is still suitable for recurring simulator evaluations.  Evaluation will consist of complete instrument evaluation (aircraft commander and  pilot)  and  applicable  portions  of  a  qualification  evaluation.    Recurring  simulator evaluations should be administered to two pilots and one FE as much as possible.  This will minimize the number of evaluation periods required as well as minimize negative impacts on refresher  training.    Due  to  unusual  or  unforeseen  circumstances,  HQ  AMC/A3TK  may approve conversion to a single-day refresher profile, in coordination with the ATS contractor. Single  day  refresher  profile  shall  be  limited  to  highly  experienced  crewmembers,  and  may not  be  accomplished  in  consecutive  quarters.    Students  in  an  approved  single-day  profile should  not  have  accomplished  a  single-day  refresher  in  the  previous  quarter.    Single-day profiles  are  inadequate  to  accomplish  all  required  training  and  accomplish  an  evaluation, therefore,  single  day  periods  will  not  be  used  to  accomplish  pilot  or  flight  engineer evaluations.    Must  be  accomplished  with  at  least  one  FPK+  on  the  crew.    ARC  may substitute an FTL A FPQ for an AC, if needed. 7.9.24.1.  Aircraft Commanders and Pilots: 7.9.24.1.1.

M010–Proficiency  Sortie.  Provides  crewmembers  specific  guidance  on  items  that should  be  accomplished  during  local  training  sorties  that  will  emphasize  core  skills.    See requirements listed below by crew position. 7.11.1.1.  Pilots:  As a minimum, a pilot proficiency sortie will consist of the following: 88 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 7.11.1.1.1.  Three instrument approaches 7.11.1.1.2.  Missed approach 7.11.1.1.3.  VFR traffic pattern (weather permitting) 7.11.1.1.4.  In  addition,  the  following  should  be  accomplished  when  available  and applicable: 7.11.1.1.4.1.  Circling approach 7.11.1.1.4.2.  Holding pattern or procedure turn (to include entry) 7.11.1.1.5.  Notes: 7.11.1.1.5.1.  If flown in the aircraft, once the exercise commences, it should not be  disrupted  for  any  other  type  of  training.    A  minimum  of  1.5  flying  hours  (1 hour for AFRC) should be scheduled for this event.  Must be  accomplished with an IP (formal school instructors are exempt from the IP requirement).  IPs should accomplish their M010 requirements with another IP on board the aircraft. 7.11.1.1.5.2.  If  accomplished  in  the  WST,  the  M010  event  does  not  require  any specific  time  requirements  as  long  as  the  requirements  listed  above  are  met.  Pilots should focus on instrument proficiency with all engines/systems operating.  This  event  is  not  intended  to  be  logged  while  handling  multiple  aircraft malfunctions.    If  an  M010  is  accomplished  in  the  WST,  the  students  must  be under the supervision of an IP or an ATS contractor pilot instructor. 7.11.1.1.5.3.  Because  holding  is  incorporated  into  the  quarterly  refresher simulator profile, M010 time need not be spent on holding unless further training is necessary. 7.11.1.1.5.4.  If circumstances prevent completion on one sortie (aircraft or WST), credit  may  be  taken  after  a  second  IP-supervised  sortie,  provided  the  combined activity fulfills the intent of this paragraph. 7.11.1.1.5.5.  Instructors should tailor each M010 to the individual pilot's needs. 7.11.1.2.  Flight  Engineers:  To  credit  a  proficiency  sortie,  flight  engineers  must complete  a  full  preflight  inspection,  perform  the  required  pre-departure  activities,  and applicable panel duties and checklists for the type mission flown.  Half of the semiannual requirements  may  be  credited  by  performing  a  through-flight  inspection  versus  a complete  preflight  inspection,  provided  all  other  duties  associated  with  a  proficiency sortie  are  accomplished.    Flight  Engineers  should  also  complete  manual  TOLD.  Exception:    AFRC  flight  engineers  may  credit  a  sortie  for  missions  flown  where  a preflight  inspection  was  not  possible  (e.g.,  NERCC),  and  a  preflight  inspection  was accomplished at another time.  When a preflight is accomplished (not associated with or after  flight),  log  a  preflight  event  P361.    When  required,  combine  the  preflight  and through-flight proficiency sortie events by logging an M013.  Logging a combined M013 will dual log to M010 and update the monthly proficiency sortie currency requirement. 7.11.1.3.  Boom  Operators:  For  FBs  and  MBs,  must  be  accomplished  under  IB supervision. For IBs, should be accomplished under IB supervision.  Complete pre-flight through  engine  shutdown  checklist  items  and  an  AR  contact  or  cargo  load  operations.   AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 89 The intent of this event is to review and reinforce all boom operator responsibilities while under instructor supervision.  Note:    If circumstances prevent completion on one sortie, credit  may  be  taken  after  a  subsequent  IB  supervised  sortie,  provided  the  combined activity fulfills the intent of this event. 7.11.2.  M013–Flight  Engineer  Proficiency  Sortie,  Combined  (ARC  Only).  See  M010 Flight Engineer requirement. 7.11.3.  M020–Unit  Specific  Training  Sortie  (UST).

Sortie  includes  primary  aircrew  logging  primary, secondary,  instructor,  or  evaluator  time  outside  the  48  contiguous  states  of  the  CONUS associated with a procedural oceanic crossing as well as a review of oceanic procedures and overseas  (non-FAA)  airspace  regulations.    Airspace  considerations  (MNPS,  RNAV/RNP, AP1/2/3/4, etc.) for the intended route of flight  will also  be  covered as  well as  a review of associated  documents  (to  include,  but  not  limited  to  the  MNPSA  Manual,  a  sample  NAT Track Message, North American Routes, and the North Atlantic European Routing System).  Crewmembers must also review oceanic re-routing procedures.  Discussions must emphasize critical  CRM  activities  associated  with  a  re-route,  with  a  focus  on  updating  the  master oceanic log, the oceanic plotting chart and the FMS.  Additionally, VVM and PM duties shall be thoroughly covered IAW AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 3, and AFI 11-290 AMC SUP.  OPR:  AMC/A3T. 7.11.4.1.  OG/CC  may  elect  to  substitute  a  CONUS  sortie,  coupled  with  an  extensive review  of  oceanic  navigation  procedures,  for  the  procedural  oceanic  obligation  when aircraft  requirements  or  crewmember  availability  is  insufficient  for  accomplishing  the oceanic sortie requirement.  Consecutive CONUS sortie substitutions are not permitted. 7.11.4.2.  OG/CC  at  OCONUS  units  may  allow  accomplishment  of  an  off  station  sortie which includes a takeoff (P020) or landing (P190) at a location other than home station.  In  all  cases,  aircrew  members  are  still  required  to  review  airspace  and  oceanic  crossing procedures. 7.11.4.3.  Crewmembers  performing  instructor  or  evaluator  duties  may  log  M030 provided appropriate airspace and oceanic procedures are instructed/evaluated during the sortie. 7.11.4.4.  Two  oceanic  sorties  may  be  credited  if  total  mission  time  exceeds  30  flight hours (AFRC crewmembers may log two oceanic sorties if total mission time is less than 30 flight hours) and the pilot logs primary, secondary, instructor, or evaluator time during oceanic crossings. 90 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 7.11.4.5.

This  attachment  provides  standardized  guidelines  on  proper training documentation.  Instructions are provided for AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder, AF  Form  4023,  Aircrew  Training  Progress  Report,  AF  Form  4024,  Aircrew  Training Accomplishment  Report,  AF  Form  4025,  Aircrew  Summary/Close-Out  Report,  and  aircrew training  guides.    These  forms  are  prescribed  in  AFI  11-2KC-10  Volume  1,    Aircrew  Training.  Units  may  use  the  Graduate  Training  Integration  Management  System  (GTIMS)  or  other AMC/A3T approved electronic gradebook in lieu of the hard-copy requirements described in this regulation.   Units must  maintain all referenced  documentation (training, reviews,  waivers, etc.) within the database when an electronic option is used. A2.1.1.  Initiate  a  training  folder  (AF  Form  4022)  for  Table  6.2  formal  training  (either  at formal  school  or  in-unit),  mission  qualification/certification,  special  qualification  or certification  training,  in-unit  upgrade  program  to  the  next  higher  crew  qualification, requalification  training  (either  at  formal  school  or  in-unit),  or  for  any  corrective  action  or additional training. A2.1.1.1.  The  unit  operations  officer  may  waive  the  training  folder  requirement  if corrective  action  or  additional  training  is  limited.    If  initiated,  the  instructor  or  flight examiner  who  evaluated  the  aircrew  member’s  performance  will  enter  comments pertinent  to  the  training  deficiency  on  AF  Form  4023  or  the  training  guide.    Use  the existing training folder for end-of-course evaluations that result in additional training. A2.1.1.2.  At  the  unit’s  discretion,  training  folders  for  an  individual  undergoing  more than one training program in a short period of time may combine all training into one AF Form 4022 or electronic folders; e.g., a tanker pilot upgrading to AC may have his or her upgrade, mission qualification/certification, and formation lead training combined in one folder. A2.1.1.3.  Electronic Training Folders and forms are authorized.  AMC directs the use of the  electronic  training  folder  program  (GTIMS)  for  all  RegAF  units.    All  requirements associated with Attachment 2 (i.e., reviews, ground training requirements, flight training time,  etc.)  will  be  documented  within  GTIMS.    GTIMS  is  a  suitable  substitute  for  AF Forms  4022,  4023,  4024  and  4025.    Units  cannot  alter  the  original  forms  without AMC/A3TK approval.  Electronic Training Folders (other than GTIMS) and reports not reproduced  on  paper  for  inclusion  in  the  AF  Form  4022  must  be  stored  in  2  places  (a primary and a backup) for at least one year. A2.1.2.  Formal  schools  will  send  AF  Form  4022  with  all  training  records  to  the  trainee’s gaining  unit.    Squadron  commanders  will  review  formal  school  training  records  and  enter appropriate comments on the training guide progress record or AF Form 4023. A2.1.3.  Squadrons  will  maintain    training  folders  for  their  personnel  in  a  location  readily accessible to instructors and supervisory personnel.  The trainee may review his or her folder at  any  time.    Electronic  versions  must  be  password  protected  to  ensure  data  integrity.  GTIMS CAC login suffices for this protection. AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 139 A2.1.4.  The instructor or trainer will review the training folder prior to all training periods.  Those areas not previously accomplished or those, in which crew members require additional training, will be noted for possible inclusion during the current training period. A2.1.5.  Upon  completion  of  training,  complete  and  place  an  AF  Form  4025  in  the individual’s  training  folder,  or  accomplish  a  sufficient  write-up  in  the  student’s  training jacket in GTIMS.  Ensure appropriate description of events accompled and note any strengths and weaknesses.  Place a copy of the AF Form 4025 in the individual’s FEF only if directed by  the  guidance  implementing  the  associated  training.    Squadrons  will  retain  all  AF  Forms 4022 for 1 year then return them to the crew member.  (N/A for GTIMS) Do not insert AF Forms  4022,  AF  Forms  4023,  AF  Forms  4024,  or  training  guide  into  FEFs.    Document  in ARMS per applicable event and paragraph 1.8. A2.1.6.  Training Guides, AF Forms (4023, 4024, 4025), GTIMS equivalent products, and/or unit  overprints  may  be  used  for  all  KC-10  continuation  and  formal  training.  The  current AMC/A3TK  approved  formal  school  training  guides  are  available  through  a  link  on  the A3TK  SharePoint  web  page:  https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/A3T/A3TK/default.aspx  or  the KC-10 ATS Website:  https://www.kc10ats.com/index.aspx. A2.1.7.  For  purposes  of  training  documentation,  classroom  only  training  conducted  at  the unit will be identified as Academic Training (AT).  Ground Training (GT) will be considered all training conducted outside the classroom  not  associated with  a flight  or aircrew training device  (Exception:    WST/BOT  G  events).    All  G  series  ground  training  referenced  in  this AFI will be referenced as (GT). A2.1.8.  Units  will  use  the  AF  Form  4324,  Aircraft  Assignment/Aircrew  Qualification Worksheet, to update aircrew certifications in ARMS.  Blocks 5 – 6 will be used to document initial, upgrade, or downgrade, of aircrew qualification.  Block 22 will be used to document award  of  specific  ARMS  “Q”  code  identifiers  containing  the  following  minimum information: “Q” code (i.e., QXXX), Certification Name (i.e., Phoenix Banner), and date of certification.    AF  Forms  1522s  may  be  used  in  lieu  of  AF  Forms  4324  to  document  new aircrew certifications that  require award of specific ARMS “Q” code identifiers that do not require  assignment  of  associated  training  profiles.    Forward  completed  form  to  the  unit SARMS  section  for  processing.    Once  updated  and  signed,  the  letter  of  X's  becomes  the source document for certifications. A2.2.  Instructions  for  AF  Form  4022.  This form is a folder constructed of hard stock paper.  The  inside  covers  have  tables  for  documenting  training.    AF  Forms  4023,  4024,  4025,  and additional information (waivers, memorandums, etc.) will be attached through the centered holes of  the  folder.    Training  guides  will  be  placed  inside  the  folder.    The  form  is  available  through unit  publications  distribution  offices  or  the  AMC  Command  Publication  Distribution  Center.  Units may organize the 4022 to fit their needs provided all necessary documentation is included in this folder.  This includes the use of tabs and/or dividers when multiple certifications or phases of  training  are  included  in  one  training  folder  (i.e.  MPD  folder  with  Phase  I,  Phase  II,  various certifications, continuation training, PCO, Aircraft Commander MCT training).

Students will print and sign their name. A2.3.7.  Reviewer  (block  12).    For  monthly  and  quarterly  reviews,  squadron  commanders, operations  officers,  or  flight  commanders  will  print  and  sign  their  name  and  indicate  their position.    Flight  commanders  may  use  their  initials  in  the  review  block  after  reviewing individual AF Form 4023 entries. A2.3.8.  AF  Form  4023  will  be  completed  and  reviewed  by  the  student  prior  to  his  or  her next training period. A2.4.  Instructions  for  the  AF  Form  4024.  This form tracks, for each sortie, individual event and task accomplishment, and grades.  Units will overprint event and task listings, total number of  repetitions  required,  and  the  required  proficiency  level  (RPL)  for  each  event  and  task.  Maintain  AF  Forms  4024  on  the  right  side  of  AF  Form  4022.    Note:    Training  guides  may  be used to  document training instead of the AF Form  4024.  The AF Form  4024 may be used  for ATS and formal school courses. A2.4.1.  Name.  Self-explanatory. A2.4.2.  Crew  Position.    Self-explanatory.    For  aircrew  members  in  an  upgrade  program, enter the aircrew position to which they are upgrading. A2.4.3.  Course  or  Phase  of  Training.    Enter  the  AFCAT  36-2223  formal  course  identifier (e.g.,  KC10P).    For  special  mission  certification,  enter  the  type  and  identify  the  method  of training (e.g., WST training, flying training, etc.). A2.4.4.  Sortie.  Enter sortie number (e.g., S-1, S-2, FTD-1, etc.). A2.4.5.  Date. A2.4.6.  Training  Event  and  Task  Listing.    Reflects  the  tasks  and  subtasks  in  the  training program that require specific student performance or knowledge proficiency standards. A2.4.7.  Number Accomplished.  Reflects the number of times an event was accomplished on that sortie. A2.4.8.  Grade.  Enter a “1,” “B,” “F,” “P,” “S,” or “U” as appropriate. A2.4.8.1.  “1”–Item  must  be  accomplished  once  by  the  crew  member,  but  does  not require proficiency. A2.4.8.2.  "B"–Briefing item only. A2.4.8.3.  "F"–Familiarization  item;  proficiency  is  not  required.    The  operations  group commander  or  equivalent  will  determine  whether  "F"  items  are  completed  by  briefing, demonstration, observation, or actual accomplishment. 144 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 A2.4.8.4.  "P"–Proficient; crew member has achieved the required proficiency level. A2.4.8.5.  "S"–Satisfactory; crew member has not achieved the required proficiency level but progress is satisfactory. A2.4.8.6.  "U"–Unsatisfactory; crew member was previously proficient, but has regressed or progress is unsatisfactory. A2.4.8.7.  Note:  Events preceded by an (*) are trained to proficiency by the contractor in the  appropriate  ATD  during  phase  1A;  however  proficiency  in  the  ATD  may  in  some cases  not  equate  to  full  aircraft  proficiency  due  to  differences  in  the  real-world  flight environment.  For this reason a student may be graded “S” until full aircraft proficiency is demonstrated in phase 1B for an event graded “*P” in the ATD.  An “S” grade denotes satisfactory  progression  and  does  not  require  contractor  notification.    However,  once  a crew  member  has  received  “P”  for  an  event  (in  phases  1A,  1B  or  MCT),  the  only subsequent  grade  allowed  is  either  “P”  or  “U”.    Likewise,  multiple  consecutive  “S” grades may indicate lack of progression and warrant a “U”.  Any event graded “U” must have an associated remark on AF Form 4023. A2.4.9.  Total Number Required.  Indicates the total repetitions of an event or task required by the course syllabus. A2.4.10.  Total  Number  Accomplished.    Total  of  the  number  of  repetitions  actually accomplished. A2.4.11.  Required  Proficiency  Level  (RPL).    RPL  for  the  specific  event  and  task.    Each event and task will have a performance standard designated for the required proficiency level the  crew  member  must  achieve.    In  addition,  each  event  and  task  may  have  (optional)  a knowledge standard designated and used in the same manner as a performance standard.  The standards  for  specific  events  are  either  listed  in  the  applicable  master  task  list  (MTL)  and evaluation  standards document (ESD) for each weapon system or identified in  this volume.  For the KC-10, all events will have an RPL of "3" for performance and "C" for knowledge (if knowledge standards are used in addition to performance standards).  KC-10 units may use “P” to signify the RPL has been attained.  Performance and knowledge standards follow: Table A2.1.  Event and Task Performance Standard. Code Performance is Definition 1 2 Extremely Limited Partially Proficient 3 Proficient Individual can do most activities only after being told or shown how. Individual can do most of the behaviors, but not necessarily to the desired levels of speed, accuracy, and safety. Individual can do and show others how to do the behavior in an activity at the minimum acceptable levels of speed, accuracy, and safety without the assistance of an instructor.  For MPD Pilots, proficiency may involve actual airplane control or non-pilot flying duties only.  For instructors, proficiency includes the ability to demonstrate, instruct, and supervise ground and flight activity. AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 145 4 Highly Proficient Individual can do behaviors in an activity at the highest level of speed, accuracy and safety. Table A2.2.  Event and Task Knowledge Standard. Code  Knowledge of Definition A B C D Fact and Nomenclature Principles and Procedures Analysis and Operating Principles Evaluation and Complete Theory Individual can identify basic facts and terms about the subject and, when used with a performance code, can state nomenclature, simple facts, or procedures involved in an activity. Individual can explain relationship of basic facts and state general principles about the subject and, when used with a performance code, can determine step-by-step procedures for sets of activities. Individual can analyze facts and principles and draw conclusions about the subject and, when used with a performance code, can describe why and when each activity must be done and tell others how to accomplish activities. Individual can evaluate conditions and create new rules or concepts about the subject and, when used with a performance code, can inspect, weigh, and design solutions related to the theory involved with activities. A2.4.11.1.  Regression.    Once  a  crewmember  has  received  “P”  for  an  event,  the  only subsequent grade allowed for that event is either “P” or “U”.  Regression occurs when an activity is graded “U” after having achieved “P” in the same task.  Regression from a “P” to a “U” requires an explanation in the student’s training folder.  The overall grade is at the instructor’s discretion.  For regression, the student will re-obtain proficiency prior to the  end  of  the  block  of  training  in  order  to  be  recommended  for  an  evaluation  (when applicable) or certification (when applicable). A2.5.  Instructions for the AF Form 4025. A2.5.1.  Units  will  close  out  student  folders  within  5  duty  days  once  training  timeline  ends IAW paragraph 1.7.1.  When a training folder is closed, a single summary/closeout report (Form  4025)  will  be  completed  detailing  the  individual's  strengths,  weaknesses,  overall performance, and other pertinent information. A2.5.2.  Squadron  commanders,  operations  officers  and  flight  commanders  will  ensure  the comments  on this form do not  reflect  personnel  opinions or biases.  All comments  must  be supported  by  information  contained  in  the  AF  Forms  4023  and  4024  or  training  guides  as applicable.    At  formal  schools,  the  instructor  will  accomplish  the  AF  Form  4025  and  the squadron commander's signature is optional. A2.6.  Aircrew  Training  Guides.  If  available,  aircrew  training  guides  (TG)  may  be  used  as reference for training programs. A2.6.1.  The  ATS  contractor  will  develop  TGs.    Units  may  produce  TGs  when  the  ATS contractor  is  unable  to  provide  them.    TGs  will  be  developed  in  accordance  with  AFI  36-146 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 2201,  Air  Force  Training  Program.    Coordinate  TG  development  through  appropriate MAJCOM with an info copy sent to AMC/A3T.  (T-2) A2.6.2.  Initiating  TGs.    Training  and  resource  management  personnel  in  each  unit  will initiate  a  TG  on  crew  members  prior  to  their  entering  any  phase  of  qualification  training.  Units may elect to use TGs as reference only and utilize AF Form 4023 and subsequently, the AF Form 4024 or GTIMS equivalent to document the completion of each training event. A2.6.3.  Use of TGs.  Specific instructions for annotating training are included in each TG. A2.6.3.1.  Active  status  TGs  may  be  carried  by  the  student  during  all  training  and operational missions and made available to the instructor for review and annotation.  The student  will  review    and  initial  the  training  progress  record  prior  to  the  next  training period. A2.6.3.2.  Complete the training progress record  with sufficient detail to specify areas of training  accomplished,  areas  needing  improvement,  recommended  specific  study  areas for the trainee, and recommended training for the next training period.  When the trainee attains sufficient knowledge, experience, and prerequisites for upgrade, the instructor will recommend an evaluation and state: "Recommend evaluation for (crew position)" on the training  progress  record.    Trainees  will  not  be  recommended  for  an  evaluation  if    any required training events  are incomplete or requires corrective action. A2.6.3.3.  On missions without an instructor or examiner, the senior qualified counterpart (e.g. AC for pilots, etc.) will accomplish required training for those areas not requiring an instructor. training  progress record.A2.6.3.4.    When  an  initial  qualification  flight  evaluation  is  not  successfully completed  and  additional  training  is  required,  the  flight  commander  will  annotate deficient areas on reproduced pages of the appropriate TG and training progress record.     Annotate  applicable the training information  on A2.6.3.5.  At the conclusion of training, when all requirements of   training are met, fill-out  an  AF  Form  4025  in  accordance  with  this  volume.    Maintain  completed    training reports and associated AF Form 4025 in a training folder according to paragraph A2.1.5. A2.6.3.6.  Do not maintain the TG or training reports in the flight evaluation folder. A2.6.4.  Review Procedures: A2.6.4.1.  Instructors  and  students  will  review  the  TG  and/or  training  reports  after  each training  period.  Training  accomplished,  problem  areas,  and  immediate  goals  will  be discussed.  The following are areas that should be covered in the comments’ section: A2.6.4.1.1.  Pilots: A2.6.4.1.1.1.  AR missions.  Indicate whether the flight  was day or night.

General  Requirements.  Qualification  training  for  KC-10  crew  members  consists  of Phases IA and IB requirements.  Phase IA is administered by the training contractor and Phase IB is  administered by US  Air Force instructors.  Phase  IA training is  contractor-developed and Air  Force-approved.    The  objective  of  Phase  IA  training  is  to  minimize  aircraft  flying  training within simulation and human factor constraints.  Phase IB training validates transfer of training from  Phase  IA;  however,  Phase  IB  training  is  driven  primarily  by  training  aircrews  to proficiency  in  receiver  AR,  formation,  various  types  of  approaches,  landings,  as  well  as experience  in  the  differences  of  the  real-world  flight  environment.    Phase  IB  training requirements and events are conducted under AMC/A3 approved syllabi.  All Phase IB training for most, if not all, students will be accomplished at the appropriate AMC FTU.  Current syllabi can be found at KC10ats.com and the EFB.  A3.1.1.  Instructor  Requirements.    All  flight  training  conducted  under  this  attachment  must be  supervised  by  a  qualified  instructor  of  like  specialty.    Crew  members  undergoing  initial qualification  training  will  be  under  "direct  instructor  supervision"  during  critical  phases  of flight.  Exceptions:  The requirement for "direct instructor supervision" during tanker AR is not  required  for  initial  qualification  students  after  demonstrating  proficiency  in  tanker autopilot-off  AR  (R080)  and  recommendation  for  “supervised  AR”  by  an  instructor  pilot.  During  initial  qualification  training,  once  the  student  demonstrates  the  ability  to  taxi  the aircraft safely (no sooner than after sortie 1), they may be certified by their instructor to taxi without direct instructor supervision. A3.1.1.1.  Two KC-10 IAC students or one PCO and one KC-10 IAC student may sit in the seats together for all flight events in which they are current and qualified.  All FTU students  still  require  direct  instructor  supervision  for  takeoff,  landing,  tactics,  and receiver AR. A3.1.2.  The  training  and  upgrade  folder  of  individuals  undergoing  training  under  this attachment must be reviewed by the instructor prior to each mission briefing for each sortie.  Areas  that  were  previously  identified  unsatisfactory  or  unsafe  must  be  reviewed  and corrective measures discussed in detail with the student.  In coordination with the FTU chief, the  instructor  will  ensure  that  the  training  contractor  is  apprised  of  less  than  satisfactory activity of a student undergoing Phase  IB training.   If  appropriate, additional academic and ATD training may be coordinated and scheduled with the training contractor. A3.1.3.  All  pilots  will  be  dual  seat  qualified.    Dual-seat  qualified  ACs  must  be  capable  of accomplishing  AC  duties  from  the  left  seat  and  pilot  duties  from  the  right  (i.e.  no requirement to be right-seat qualified in receiver AR). A3.1.4.  Prior to commencing Phase IB flight training in the KC-10, each crew member, with the  exception  of  SSF  students,  will  be  administered  an  evaluation  (Q005  or  Q006  as appropriate) in the applicable ATD.  This evaluation will be used to assess the effectiveness of contractor training as well as the capabilities and proficiency of the student. A3.2.  Initial  Qualification  Training.  Conducted  at  the  appropriate  contract  training  facility and Air Force unit.  Training is designed to qualify aircrew members in specific crew positions AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 149 of  the  KC-10  aircraft.    Initial  qualification  training  requirements  are  found  in  the  appropriate syllabi.    Specific  course  prerequisite,  entry  qualifications,  and  other  requirements  are  listed  in Table 6.1. A3.2.1.  KC-10  ACIQ  –  Aircraft  Commander  Initial  Qualification  (PTX-1):  Qualifies  prior MWS, FAIP, and OSA Aircraft Commanders as a KC-10 Aircraft Commander. A3.2.2.  KC-10 PIQ – Pilot  Initial Qualification: Qualifies an SUPT graduate to operate the KC-10 from both seats but does not result in an Aircraft Commander certifiable pilot.  The pilot will be Aircraft Commander certified in unit or via PCO per Chapter 5. A3.2.3.  KC-10  FBP  –  Flight  Engineer  Basic  Prequalification  Course:  Provides  required training  for  Senior  Airman  and  above  with  no  prior  Flight  Engineer  experience  to successfully  complete  the  KC-10  FIQ  follow  on  course.    Requires  BFE  (Lackland  AFB) prerequisite. A3.2.4.  KC-10  FIQ  –  Flight  Engineer  Initial  Qualification:  Qualifies  a  prior  fixed  wing performance engineer as a KC-10 Flight Engineer.  Experience requirement is at least three years  as  a  performance  engineer  (fixed  wing).    Also  qualifies  KC-10  FBP  graduates  (see paragraph  A3.2.3) as KC-10 Flight Engineer. A3.2.5.  KC-10  BBQ  –  Boom  Operator  (Basic)  Initial  Qualification:  Qualifies  member  as KC-10 Boom Operator.  Requires BBO (CEA CoE) prerequisite. A3.2.6.  KC-10  SSF  –  Senior  Staff  Officer  Familiarization  Course:    The  contractor-administered Senior Staff Officer Familiarization Course  consists of three days of academic and simulator training followed by one aircraft flight.  It is intended for familiarization only and  does  not  lead  to  qualification  in  the  aircraft.    Senior  Staff  Officers  who  complete  this course cannot log FP time nor be at a set of controls with passengers on the aircraft.  Senior staff-level personnel who previously accomplished a formal KC-10 pilot training course that resulted in a Form 8 qualification (i.e., KC-10 SOC, KC-10 PCO, KC-10 IAC, etc.) receive credit for the KC-10 SSF course.  Regardless of the venue of KC-10 SSF course credit, KC-10  SSF  course  credit  expires  39  months  from  the  date  of  the  member's  last  KC-10  aircraft flight.  A3.2.7.  KC-10  SOC  –  Senior  Officer  Course:    The  Senior  Officer  Course  consists  of  pre-course  CBTs,  5  days  of  contractor  administered  academic  and  simulator  training,  and  a maximum of four flights with Air Force instructors.  This training is the minimum required to attain basic qualification in the aircraft with instructor supervision. A3.2.7.1.  School  Quotas  for  Senior  Officer  courses  are  controlled  by  AMC/A3TF.  These courses are scheduled according to  need in  cooperation with  the  ATS contractor.  Training throughput requirements may affect availability of these courses.  Requests for training  should  be  forwarded  to  AMC/A3TF/K  (AFRC  users  contact  AFRC/A3TA).  AMC/A3TF will work in conjunction with AMC/A1A and AFRC/A1T to finalize course approvals and schedules.  These requests must be submitted a minimum of 45 days prior to  requested  start  date.    AMC/A3  will  be  final  authority  should  a  disagreement  arise regarding eligibility. 150 AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 A3.3.  Aircraft Commander Upgrade.  Individuals may upgrade to aircraft commander via the formal Pilot Check Out (PCO) course or in-unit.  The preferred method for aircraft commander upgrade is PCO. A3.4.  Aircrew  Instructor  Program.  Courses  are  designed  to  teach  selected  crew  members fundamentals and concepts of instructing. A3.4.1.  Pre-course materials  will be provided by the contractor to  the unit  no later than 35 days  prior  to  course  start  date.    The  package  will  contain  a  road  map  of  the  course, supplemental materials, pre-course reading assignments, and a course workbook.  Squadron Training  Units  will  request  pre-course  materials  from  the  site  contractor  and  ensure successful completion prior to course start date. A3.4.2.  Specific course prerequisites, entry qualifications, and other requirements are listed in  Table  5.3.    All  instructor  candidates  will  be  trained  to  a  level  of  proficiency  that  will ensure  their  ability  to  instruct  and  supervise  student  activity.    Successful  completion  of ground  and  flight  requirements,  including  completing  an  AFI  11-202,  Volume  2,  as supplemented, evaluation, qualifies the individual to be placed in instructor status. A3.4.2.1.  KC-10  IAC  –  Instructor  Aircraft  Commander  Course:  Qualifies  current  and qualified KC-10 AC as a KC-10 IP. A3.4.2.2.  KC-10 FIC – Flight Engineer Instructor Course: Qualifies current and qualified KC-10 FE as a KC-10 IF. A3.4.2.3.  KC-10  BIC  –  Boom  Operator  instructor  Course:  Qualifies  current  and qualified KC-10 MB as a KC-10 IB. A3.5.  Formal  Training  Unit.  The  flying  phase  of  training  is  accomplished  at  the  Formal Training  Unit  (FTU).    Although  a  considerable  amount  of  time  is  spent  mission  planning  for sorties, due to the dynamic nature of the tanker mission, instructors are given great flexibility in accomplishing activity during sorties.  Therefore the syllabi provide a recommended number of sorties, but training is complete once proficiency is gained in all the required areas. A3.5.1.  In  order  to  ensure  continuity  of  training,  limit  the  number  of  different  flight instructors  to  a  maximum  of  four  for  students  undergoing  qualification,  requalification,  or upgrade training (not applicable for all AFRC training and RegAF initial cargo qualification).  Squadron  commanders  may  waive  the  four-instructor  limit  on  a  case-by-case  basis.    The flying squadron commander, operations officer, Det 1 AMCAOS personnel, and FTU Chiefs (Pilot,  FE,  and  BO)  do  not  count  against  the  four-instructor  rule.    A  copy  of  the  waiver (including waiver justification) will be filed in the AF Form 4022.  Additionally, each student will  have  one  instructor  who  will  monitor  the  student’s  progress  throughout  their  training.  This primary instructor will be designated, in writing, and will personally ensure the student is proficient in all required areas and is ready for evaluation, if required. A3.6.  Failure  to  Complete  Formal  Training.  Refer  to  the  appropriate  course  syllabus  for guidance.  The formal school will send a recommendation to the individual’s unit on whether he or she should complete training in-unit (which requires a waiver), be eliminated, or return to the formal school for training. A3.6.1.  Phase  IA.  An  individual  may  be  removed  from  Phase  IA  training  if  identified  by the  training  contractor  as  incapable  of  successfully  completing  a  course  of  instruction.    A AFI11-2KC-10V1  1 MARCH 2016 151 joint Air Force and contractor review of the identified student’s record will be conducted and a joint recommendation made as to termination or continuation.  The training contractor will notify the applicable squadron commander and Det 1 AMCAOS to determine the appropriate course of action. A3.6.1.1.  Det 1 AMCAOS will: A3.6.1.1.1.  Review  training  records  to  ensure  the  training  provided  was  within contract requirements and guidelines. A3.6.1.1.2.  Review  required  procedures  and  assist  local  units  in  taking  appropriate action  to  ensure  that  aircrew  members  who  cannot  meet  training  proficiency standards are eliminated from training.  See AFI 11-402. A3.6.1.2.  The squadron commander will: A3.6.1.2.1.  Chair Air Force and contractor review of the identified student’s record. A3.6.1.2.2.  Request the contractor to provide additional training, if appropriate. A3.6.1.2.3.  If  the  student  is  to  be  eliminated  from  training,  notify  AMC/A3TK  and AFRC/A3T  (AFRC  disqualification  or  suspension  from  aviation  service),  via message with information to the appropriate NAF/A3T, if applicable. A3.6.2.  Phases IB.  If an individual is unable or unwilling to complete any phase of training, the  determination  of  the  appropriate  administrative  action  rests  with  the  squadron commander. (See AFI 11-402 for flight evaluation board or administrative procedures.) Table A3.1.  Initial Qualification Ground Training Requirements (Phase IB).
