Conduct  all  T-38  aircrew  evaluations  according  to  the provisions of AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and this instruction. (T-1). 1.2.  Procedures: 1.2.1.  Flight examiners (FE) will use the evaluation criteria contained in this instruction for conducting flight and emergency procedure evaluations (EPE). (T-2). To ensure standard and objective  evaluations,  FEs  must  become  thoroughly  familiar  with  the  prescribed  evaluation criteria. 1.2.2.  When  available,  use  video  tape  or  Data  Transfer  System  (DTS)  information  to reconstruct or evaluate the mission. (T-2). 1.2.3.  Unless specified, the examinee or FE may fly in any flight position or seat (to include chase) that will best enable the FE to conduct a thorough evaluation. 1.2.4.  Prior to the flight, the FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how  it  will  be  conducted.  (T-2).  The  examinee  will  accomplish  required  flight  planning according  to  the  flight  position  during  the  evaluation.  (T-2).  Higher  headquarters  FEs  (and unit FEs as determined locally) will be furnished a copy of necessary mission data, mission materials, and maps, if required. (T-2). 1.2.5.  Areas  required  by  AFI  11-202,  Volume  2,  are  indicated  in  Chapter  2  of  this  AFI. When it is impossible to evaluate a required area in flight, it will be evaluated by an alternate method (that is, in a simulator or cockpit procedure trainer [CPT] or by oral examination) to complete the evaluation. (T-2). The alternate method of evaluation will be documented in the examiner’s  remarks  in  the  Comments  block  of  the  AF  Form  8,  Certificate  of  Aircrew Qualification. (T-2). 1.2.6.  The  FE  will  thoroughly  debrief  all  aspects  of  the  flight.  (T-2).  This  debrief  will include the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified),  and  any  required  additional  training.  (T-2).  A  squadron  supervisor  must  be debriefed  on  all  evaluations.  (T-2).  Additionally,  a  squadron  supervisor  must  attend  the debrief if the overall grade is Q-3. (T-2). 1.3.  Grading Instructions: 1.3.1.  Tolerances  in  performance  parameters  are  based  on  conditions  of  smooth  air  and  a stable  aircraft.  Momentary  deviations  from  tolerances  will  not  be  considered  in  grading, provided  the  examinee  applies  prompt  corrective  action,  and  such  deviations  do  not jeopardize flying safety. (T-2).  Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade. (T-2). 1.3.2.  FEs  will  use  the  grading  criteria  in  Tables  1.1,  3.1,  and  3.2  to  determine  individual area grades. (T-2). FE judgment must be exercised when the wording of areas is subjective and specific situations are not covered. (T-2). AFI11-2T-38V2  5 AUGUST 2014   5  1.3.3.  The general evaluation criteria in Table 1.1 for basic aircraft control apply during all phases of flight (except as noted for specific events and instrument final approaches). Table 1.1.  General Criteria. General Area Altitude Airspeed Q Q- U +200 feet +5 percent +300 feet +10 percent VOR or TACAN Course +5  degrees  or  3  NM (whichever is greater) +10  degrees  or  5  NM (whichever is greater) RNAV Course +2 NM Visual Navigation Course +5 NM VOR/DME or TACAN Arc  +2 NM +3 NM +10 NM +3 NM Exceeded Q- limits 1.3.4.  When grading criteria specify that the airspeed or angle of attack (AOA) be evaluated, and the flight manual lists only a minimum, maximum, recommended airspeed or AOA for that area, the examinee will brief the desired airspeed or AOA. (T-2). 1.3.5.  When  grading  criteria  specify  “knots,”  the  performance  is  based  on  the  appropriate airspeed  for  the  aircraft  model:  knots  indicated  airspeed  for  the  T-38A  or  knots  calibrated airspeed for the T-38C. (T-2). 1.3.6.  When grading criteria includes references to a “procedures manual,” FEs will refer to the  appropriate  manual:  AFMAN  11-250,  Volume  1,  T-38  Flying  Fundamentals,  AFMAN 11-251,  Volume  1,  T-38C  Flying  Fundamentals,  AETCTTP  11-1,  Employment Fundamentals T-38C/Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF), or 3-3.AT38C, IFF Basic Employment Manual (ENJJPT). (T-2). 1.3.7.  When  grading  criteria  includes  an  evaluation  of  the  aircrew’s  interface  with  ground controlled intercept (GCI), airborne warning and control system (AWACS), or other assets, performance parameters are based on mission-qualified controllers or aircrew members. FEs may make allowances for the controllers’ or other assets’ training requirements. 1.3.8.  When  grading  criteria  includes  an  evaluation  of  timing,  base  the  evaluation  on  an ordinance  impact  for  a  preplanned  time  on  target  (TOT)  or  TOT  for  target  over  flight,  as agreed to in the briefing. The FE may substitute time at another preplanned point if a delayed range  clearance  affects  timing  and  may  widen  the  timing  criteria  for  extensive  threat reactions or route weather. 1.4.  Emergency  Procedures  Evaluation  (EPE).  In  order  of  preference,  the  EPE  will  be conducted  in  a  simulator,  cockpit  procedure  trainer  (CPT),  or  verbally.  (T-2).  Only  conduct  a verbal  EPE  if  a  simulator  or  CPT  is  not  available  or  not  configured  appropriately  for  the evaluation. (T-2). PIT and ENJJPT PIT trainees will accomplish EPEs IAW the syllabus. (T-2). 1.4.1.  The FE will include an evaluation of the following items on the EPE: (T-2) 1.4.1.1.  General knowledge to include aircraft systems and operating procedures, as well as use of the National Airspace System.   6  AFI11-2T-38V2  5 AUGUST 2014 1.4.1.2.  Emergency procedures. Evaluate all BOLDFACE procedures and a minimum of one emergency procedure per phase of flight. 1.4.1.3.  Unusual attitude recoveries. 1.4.1.4.  A minimum of one approach and use of standby or emergency instruments. 1.4.1.5.  A  minimum  of  one  approach  at  other  than  home  base  (alternate  or  divert airfields). 1.4.2.  Units will not permit examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade (Q-3) because of  an  unsatisfactory  EPE  to  fly  in  any  aircrew  position  until  the  examinee  completes  a successful reevaluation. (T-2). 1.4.3.  For EPEs graded “Q” with  additional training required, the FE  will indicate whether the additional training must be accomplished before the next flight. (T-2). Additional training and  reevaluations  will  be  accomplished  in  accordance  with  (IAW)  AFI  11-202,  Volume  2. (T-2). 1.4.4.  Grading criteria for each EPE area is listed in Table 3.2. 1.5.  Completion of AF Form 8/8a.  FEs will record aircrew member qualification using the AF Form 8 or AF Form 8a. (T-2). 1.5.1.  Documentation of Evaluation. When an evaluation in any model of the T-38 satisfies the  evaluations  requirements  in  any  other  T-38  model,  include  a  remark  in  the  Examiner’s Remarks section of the AF Form 8/8a. (T-2). 1.5.2.  Documentation  of  Weapons  Employment  Results.  Weapons  employment  results  will be documented in the Examiner’s Remarks of the AF Form 8/8a under Mission Description as follows: (T-2) 1.5.2.1.  Air-to-Surface Results. Record the results using “hit” or “miss”. (T-2). FEs will evaluate weapons employment results based upon the examinee’s ability to achieve valid release  parameters  for  the  event  flown  and  the  type  of  range.  (T-2).  FEs  will  refer  to applicable training standards for event parameter tolerances. (T-2). 1.5.2.2.  Air-to-Air  Results.  Record  the  number  of  simulated  missile  or  gun  firing “attempted”  and  the  number  that  were  “valid”.  (T-2).  Include  entries  for  each  type  of simulated  ordnance  employed.  (T-2).  FEs  will  refer  to  applicable  training  syllabus  to determine valid employment criteria. (T-2). AFI11-2T-38V2  5 AUGUST 2014   7  Chapter 2 EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS 2.1.  General.  There are six types of evaluation  in  the T-38:  qualification (QUAL), instrument (INSTM),  mission  (MSN),  instructor  (INSTR),  rear  cockpit  (RCP)  landing  qualification,  and SPOT. Evaluations include requisites and required areas. Table 2.1 indicates when a requisite is required  for  an evaluation. Table 2.2 prescribes the required areas that  must be included in  the flight evaluation profile. Required areas are aligned under the type of evaluation. 2.1.1.  MSN Evaluation Scenarios. Units will conduct MSN evaluations using scenarios that represent  the  unit’s  mission.  (T-2).  FEs  will  designate  mission  profiles  to  evaluate  the training, flight position, and special qualifications of the examinee. (T-2). To the maximum extent possible, IPs and flight leads (FL) will brief and lead the mission. The FE may require the FL to fly the wing position to perform events from the wing position. 2.1.2.  Formal  Course  Evaluations.  Conduct  formal  course  evaluations  on  a  mission  profile developed from syllabus training objectives. (T-2). FEs will use syllabus training standards to evaluate tasks not addressed in Chapter 3. (T-2). 2.1.3.  Alternate Methods of Evaluation.  If it is impossible to accomplish a required area in flight, the FE may elect to evaluate the areas by an alternate method (for example, simulator, CPT,  orally,  etc.)  in  order  to  complete  the  evaluation.  The  alternate  evaluation  will  be documented  in  the  Examiner’s  Remarks  section  of  the  AF  Form  8  under  Additional Comments. (T-2). If the FE determines the required area cannot be adequately evaluated by an  alternate  method,  the  examinee  must  complete  an  additional  flight  to  complete  the evaluation. (T-2). 2.1.4.  Publications  Check.  The  FE  will  check  the  examinee’s  in-flight  guide  and  the appropriate  flight  manual  checklist  during  all  QUAL  checks.  (T-2).  Units  may  require  a check of additional publications. 2.2.  Requisites.  Table 2.1 indicates the minimum requisites for each type of evaluation. When periodic evaluations are combined, accomplish all requisites for each evaluation and document in the  corresponding  phase  of  the  AF  Form  8.  (T-2).  Completed  requisites  may  be  used  for  more than one evaluation IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2. Table 2.1.  Evaluation Requisites (T-2).

Pilot Evaluations: 2.3.1.  Pilot  INSTM  and  QUAL  Evaluations.  The  pilot  INSTM  and  QUAL  evaluations  are normally  combined.  A  mission  flown  according  to  instrument  flight  rules  fulfills  the objective of the combined INSTM/QUAL evaluation. 2.3.1.1.  To  the  maximum  extent  possible,  this  evaluation  will  include  approaches  at airfields other than the examinee’s home field. 2.3.1.2.  The  initial  (INIT)  or  requalification  (RQ)  evaluation  will  be  flown  in  the  front cockpit  (FCP).  (T-2).  Pilots  who  maintain  basic  aircraft  qualification  will  occupy  the front cockpit during periodic evaluations. (T-2). 2.3.1.3.  Multiple  qualification  pilots  who  complete  an  INSTM  evaluation  in  another aircraft  are  not  required  to  complete  an  INSTM  evaluation  in  the  T-38.  Note:  Unit commanders may require pilots to complete this additional INSTM evaluation. 2.3.2.  Pilot  MSN  Evaluations.  Mission-qualified  pilots  will  complete  an  INIT  or  RQ  MSN evaluation  for  each  mission  for  which  they  maintain  qualification:  Undergraduate  Pilot Training  (UPT),  IFF,  Companion  Trainer  Program  (CTP),  or  T-38A  Adversary  Pilot (ADAIR). (T-2). The INIT or RQ INSTR/MSN evaluation at Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) meets  the  requirement  for  mission  qualification  in  the  UPT,  PIT,  and  CTP  missions.  The INIT  or  RQ  INSTR/MSN  evaluation  in  IFF  IP  upgrade  meets  the  requirement  for  mission qualification  in  the  IFF  and  CTP  missions.  The  INIT  or  RQ  MSN/INSTR  evaluation  in ADAIR meets the requirement for mission qualification in ADAIR. 2.3.2.1.  UPT  and  PIT  MSN  Evaluations.  Mission-qualified  UPT  and  PIT  IPs  will complete  a  contact,  formation,  instrument/navigation,  or  low-level  mission  evaluation. (T-2). The examinee will occupy the RCP on INIT or RQ MSN evaluations during PIT. (T-2). 2.3.2.2.  IFF MSN Evaluations. Mission-qualified IFF pilots will complete either an air-to-surface or air-to-air MSN evaluation. (T-2). 2.3.2.2.1.  Air-to-Surface  Evaluation.  The  examinee  will  normally  lead  a  four-ship surface attack sortie. However, any air-to-surface profile the examinee is qualified to fly may be flown. 2.3.2.2.2.  Air-to-air  Evaluation.  The  examinee  will  normally  lead  a  basic  fighter maneuver (BFM) sortie. However, any air-to-air profile the examinee is qualified to fly may be flown. 2.3.2.3.  CTP  MSN  Evaluations.  Multiple  (aircraft)  qualification  pilots  who  complete  a MSN  evaluation  in  their  primary  aircraft  are  not  required  to  complete  the  MSN evaluation  in  the  T-38.  All  other  mission-qualified  CTP  pilots  will  complete  a  contact, formation, low-level, or instrument/navigation MSN evaluation. (T-2). AFI11-2T-38V2  5 AUGUST 2014   9  2.3.2.4.  ADAIR  MSN  Evaluations.  ADAIR  pilots  will  complete  an  air-to-air  MSN evaluation. (T-2). 2.3.3.  Pilot  INSTR  Evaluations.  All  instructor  evaluations  will  evaluate  INSTR  required areas  and  the  examinee’s  instructor  knowledge  and  ability.  (T-2).  Instructor  pilots  must complete  an  INIT  INSTR  or  RQ  INSTR  evaluation,  which  is  normally  combined  with  the INIT  or  RQ  MSN  evaluation.  (T-2).  The  examinee  will  occupy  the  crew  position  normally occupied when performing instructor duties. (T-2). 2.3.3.1.  INIT  INSTR  Evaluations.  To  initially  qualify  as  an  instructor,  a  crewmember must successfully complete a dedicated INIT INSTR evaluation. (T-2). An FE will act as a student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s instructional ability. (T-2). 2.3.4.  Pilot RCP Evaluations. All pilots qualified to land in the RCP will complete an INIT RCP landing qualification evaluation. (T-2). Periodic RCP evaluations will be combined with another evaluation flown in the RCP. (T-2). RCP landing qualification is mandatory for IPs. (T-2). The examinee will occupy the RCP. (T-2). 2.3.4.1.  FEs  will  include  “Rear  Cockpit  Landing  Qualification”  in  the  Examiner’s Remarks section of the AF Form 8/8a under Mission Description. (T-2). 2.3.4.2.  When  the  RCP  landing  qualification  is  evaluated  as  a  flight  requisite  for  an evaluation, record “SPOT” in the flight phase block on the AF Form 8. (T-2). 2.3.4.3.  All  RCP  landing  qualification  evaluations  will  include  in-flight  evaluation  of overhead  and  straight-in  patterns,  and  simulated  single-engine  (SE),  no-flap  (NF),  and normal landings flown in the RCP. (T-2). 2.3.5.  Instructor  Pilot  Loss  of  Qualification.  Instructor  pilots  who  lose  their  instrument and/or mission qualification will not perform instructional duties. (T-2). 2.4.  Weapons  System  Officer  (WSO)  Evaluations.  All  WSO  evaluations  are  combined QUAL/MSN evaluations. (T-2). 2.4.1.  WSOs will complete the combined QUAL/MSN evaluation using mission profiles that support the unit’s mission, for example IFF. (T-2). 2.4.2.  Instructor WSOs (IW) will complete an  INIT QUAL/MSN/INSTR evaluation. (T-2). Subsequently,  all  periodic  evaluations  will  evaluate  INSTR  required  areas  and  the examinee’s  instructor  knowledge  and  ability.  (T-2).  Accomplish  periodic  instructor evaluations on actual instructional missions whenever possible. (T-2). When students are not available  or  mission  requirements  or  crew  composition  requirements  prevent  inclusion  of students,  the  FE  may  serve  as  the  student  for  the  purpose  of  evaluating  the  examinee’s instructional  ability.
