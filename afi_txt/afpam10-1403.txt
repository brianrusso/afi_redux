Attachment 1—GLOSSARY OF REFERENCES AND SUPPORTING INFORMATION       3  20 21 22 Section A—Mobility Planning 1.  How To Use This Pamphlet 1.1.  There  are  four  basic  parts  to  this  pamphlet:  terms  and  definitions,  formulas,  planning factors, and examples. Although each of these parts can be individually used, we recommend you review the entire contents to get a full understanding of the planning process. 1.2.  Due  to  the  number  of  variables  involved  in  every  air  mobility  operation,  the  planning factors presented are not universally applicable. Instead, they provide ―order of magnitude‖ approximations in the context of a generic scenario. The use of detailed computer simulation models is encouraged for extensive calculations. 1.3.  This  pamphlet  only  addresses  objective  planning  computations.    It  does  not  provide guidance  concerning  other  factors  such  as  environmental  and  tactical  considerations  which can impact the mobility operation. Section B—Airlift Formulas 2.  Number of Cargo Missions Required  3.  Number of Passenger (PAX) Missions Required   NOTE: PAX on Cargo Missions = Number of PAX seats available on each cargo mission x Number of Cargo Missions.  4.  Total Missions Required   = Cargo missions + PAX missions  5.  Time to Arrival   = active route flying time (ARFT)   +   active route ground time (ARGT)          4   6.  Cycle Time AFPAM10-1403  12 DECEMBER 2011 = round trip flying time (RTFT)  +   round trip ground time (RTGT)   7.  Closure     NOTE: For major wartime operations, we recommend planners use the wartime objective surge UTE  rates  published  in  Table  6.  For  non-mobilized  contingencies,  we  recommend  the contingency UTE rates published in  Table  6. The computations involved in determining actual UTE rates are quite involved and not necessary for initial gross planning estimates. 8.  Fleet Capability   Short tons delivered to the theater per day    NOTE: This formula is preferred for contingency planning because it accurately relates the variables affecting the deployment of requirements.  9.  Fleet Capacity   Million ton-miles per day    NOTE: Although planners do not commonly use this formula, occasionally we need to convert short  ton  figures  into  million  ton-miles  per  day  (MTM/D).  AMC  force  structure  programmers use  MTM/D  when  funding  out-year  aircraft  purchases  and  many  civilian  agencies  are accustomed  to  visualizing  our  fleet  capability  in  terms  of  MTM/D.  Fleet  Capacity  is  generally more optimistic than actual Fleet Capability for a particular contingency. 10.  Airfield Throughput Capability (station capability)  NOTE: Use the lower of the working, parking, or fuel MOG. Section C—Air Refueling Formulas  AFPAM10-1403  12 DECEMBER 2011   5  11.  Air  Refueling  Overview  Refer to  Table  10,  Table  11, and  Table  12 for determining  the approximate number of tankers required to  meet  the air refueling  requirements for various size fighter/airlift deployments. These tables were constructed using average/historical data and will provide a gross estimate of the size and duration of an air refueling operation. If actual mission specifics  and  data  are  known,  such  as  aircraft  model,  configuration,  air  refueling  altitude, airspeed,  tanker  basing,  etc,  using  the  formulas  below  will  provide  more  accurate  planning estimates. However, this formula does not consider specific air refueling abort reserves and the impact  on  destination  fuel.  As  stated  in  the  introduction  we  recommend  using  computer simulation models whenever feasible. 11.1.  Offload Required (per receiver)   Distance  = total distance from takeoff to landing   TAS = average airspeed of receiver leg (use Table 4 Aircraft Block Speeds or applicable flight manual airspeeds for other aircraft.)  Fuel Flow = fuel burn rate in lbs/hr  Total Fuel = total fuel on board at takeoff  Destination Reserve = required fuel reserves at destination 11.2.  Offload Available (per tanker)  11.3.  Tankers Required  Section D—Aeromedical Evacuation Formulas 12.  Aeromedical  Evacuation  Overview  Refer  to  AFI  11-2AE  V3  Addenda  A  for  detailed aircraft  specific  configuration  and  mission  planning.    Use  the  following  formulas  and  data  in Table  14  to  determine  the  AE  force  and  capabilities.  In  the  near  term,  AE  will  be  primarily accomplished  using,  C-21,  C-130,  KC-135,  or  C-17  aircraft.    Opportune  airlift  may  be  used, keeping the best interest of the patient and crew in mind. When the aeromedical segment (Stage II or Stage III) of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) is activated, the B-767 will be the primary means of intertheater AE, with  augmentation by military aircraft such  as KC-135 and C-17,  as necessary.  An AE crew consists of two (2) flight nurses and three (3) medical technicians.  12.1.  AE Missions (# required per day)     6  AFPAM10-1403  12 DECEMBER 2011 Aircraft Load Planning Factor = standard number of patients loaded per aircraft for aeromedical evacuation (see Table 14).  12.2.  AE Crew (# required for missions flown, does not include stage)   Crews per Aircraft: Refer to Table 14  Crew Cycle Time:  Intratheater (Within Theater) =  2 days Intertheater (Theater to CONUS) = 4 days Section E—Examples 13.  Airlift  Example.  As  an  example  of  how  to  use  the  formulas  and  planning  factors  in  this pamphlet,  assume  the  following  scenario.  The  10th  Mountain  Div.  out  of  Ft.  Drum,  NY,  is  to deploy  to  Kathmandu,  Nepal,  at  the  foot  of  the  Himalayas,  to  assist  in  earthquake  relief.  The requirement is to move 700 personnel and 800 short tons of cargo. NOTE:  The following examples use International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) codes, which are four-character alphanumeric code designating each airport around the world and commonly used in flight planning. 13.1.  Suitable Airfield 13.1.1.  Referring  to  the  Aircraft  Airfield  Restrictions  (Table  1),  we  see  that  the  B-767 requires a minimum of 6,000 feet of runway and the C-17 requires a minimum of 3,500 feet.  Since the  airfield at Ft.  Drum, Wheeler-Sack AAF, has  a runway length  of 10,000 feet, it meets the requirements for both aircraft (this assumes adequate runway width). NOTE: Refer to the HQ AMC Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) or the airfield database (AFD) in AMC‘s Global Decision Support System (GDSS) to determine suitability for mobility aircraft (C-5, C-17, C-21, C-130, KC-10, KC-135).   If the airfield does not appear in the  ASRR/AFD,  contact  AMC/A3AS  and  request  the  airfield  be  evaluated  and  added  to  the database  (Airfield.Helpdesk@amc.af.mil).  AMC/A3AS  will  provide  prompt  feedback  and include suitability information in future editions of the ASRR. 13.1.2.  Looking  in  the  Kathmandu  area,  we  find  Tribhuvan  International  airport  in Kathmandu to have 10,121 feet of runway which, along with the associated taxiways and ramp, is stressed for B-767 aircraft. Therefore, we make our initial plans based on using Wheeler Sack AAF as the onload and Tribhuvan International as the offload. 13.2.  Missions Required.  Our examples will address only the cargo requirements, however passenger  movement  would  be  handled  in  a  similar  manner.  For  all  examples  to  follow, assume  we  have  15  C-17s  apportioned  for  our  use  and  we  will  use  crew  staging  where necessary.   AFPAM10-1403  12 DECEMBER 2011   7     13.3.  Time  to  Arrival.  The  time  required  for  cargo/PAX  to  arrive  at  the  offload  location including  all  en  route  ground  times.  For  this  example,  the  C-17‘s  will  depart  McGuire (KWRI), fly to Wheeler Sack AAF (KGTB) for onload, then en route stop at Rota (LERT), Dhahran  (OEDR),  Delhi,  (VIDP),  and  then  offload  at  Tribhuvan  (VNKT).  Refer  to definitions and tables as needed. =   active route flying time (ARFT)  +  active route ground time (ARGT)             NOTE:  First leg from McGuire to Wheeler is inactive as it‘s a positioning leg.  Block speeds were interpolated from Table 4.      (refer to Table 5.)     = 26.55 hours     13.4.  Cycle Time.  For this example, we calculated round trip flying time (RTFT) and round trip ground time (RTGT) using reverse routing except the last leg will be from Rota (LERT) to McGuire (KWRI).   Refer to definitions for RTFT and RTGT. Cycle Time = round trip flying time (RTFT) + round trip ground time (RTGT)                  8  AFPAM10-1403  12 DECEMBER 2011     = 20 hours    13.5.  Closure     = 3.8 days   13.6.  Fleet Capability (short tons delivered to the theater)     = 208.8 Stons/day   13.7.  Airfield Throughput Capability  It is necessary to look at the throughput capability of all airfields associated with a deployment, to determine whether any one airfield limits a planned operation.  However, for initial planning, the en route locations may be assumed to have a higher throughput capability than the onload and offload locations. For this example, we have used Tribhuvan International and a working MOG of one narrow body (NB) aircraft.    Airfield Throughput Capability (e.g.., Tribhuvan)        = 282.5 Stons/day (Refer to Table 8.)   NOTE: Since the arrival airfield can handle the estimated fleet capability that will be delivered, this calculation is complete. If the fleet capability had exceeded the airfield‘s throughput, either the flow would need to be slowed to compensate or the airfield‘s resources increased to handle the airflow.  14.  Air  Refueling  Example.  For  this  example,  assume  you  need  to  deploy  6  F-15C‘s  from Langley (KLFI) to Spangdahlem (ETAD). How much fuel and how many tankers (KC-135R) are AFPAM10-1403  12 DECEMBER 2011   9  required?    Note:  For  this  example  average/historical  figures  were  used.  Actual  numbers  would vary according to aircraft model, configuration, altitude, airspeed, etc.  14.1.  Onload Required (per receiver)  Distance  =  total distance from takeoff to landing   TAS = average airspeed of receiver leg (use Table 4. for mobility aircraft or applicable flight manual airspeeds for other aircraft.)   Fuel Flow = fuel burn rate in lbs/hr  Total Fuel = total fuel on board at takeoff  Destination Reserves = required fuel reserves at destination = (3500/480 x 10,822) - 23,000 + 7500  = 63,410 lbs (per receiver) x 6 = 380,462 lbs  14.2.  Offload Available (per tanker)           =  71,848 lbs per tanker  14.3.  Tankers required  =  380,462   (rounded up)      71,848   =  6 KC-135Rs required  15.  Aeromedical Evacuation Example.  For this example, C-130s will be used to evacuate 500 patients per day. 15.1.  AE Missions (# required)   = 10 AE Missions required    10  AFPAM10-1403  12 DECEMBER 2011  Table 1.

HQ AMC/A3 retains runway criteria waiver authority for AMC organic aircraft.  2. Refer to DOD Flight Information Handbook for an airfield‘s specific Pavement Classification Number (PCN) and subgrade as well as additional aircraft Aircraft Classification Number (ACN). Table 1 reflects values for the aircraft‘s empty weight and the aircraft‘s maximum take-off/taxi weight.  3. Refer to the weight bearing information in the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) or Global Decision Support System (GDSS) for an airfield‘s specific PCN and sub-grade. The GDSS also provides weight bearing capacity (WBC) information when pavement strength is reported in terms other than ACN or PCN, and translates raw WBC into aircraft gross weight limits.  Planners can contact the AMC Airfield Help Desk (Airfield.Helpdesk@amc.af.mil) for assistance regarding weight bearing capacity information in the ASRR or GDSS/AFD.  Mobility aircraft planners will use only the weight bearing information figures published in the ASRR and GDSS.  4. For Non-Tactical Assault Operations, minimum runway width is 80 ft; minimum runway length is 5000 ft. 5. Values listed are maximum values for the Aircraft Type. AFPAM10-1403  12 DECEMBER 2011   11   Table 2.

Active  route  flying  time  (ARFT)—  The  flying  time  from  onload  to  the  offload  location including all intermediate locations en route. This does not include ground time. Active  route  ground  time  (ARGT)—  The  cumulative  ground  time  of  all  intermediate  stops from the onload location to the offload location. This does not include flying time. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Patients— Litter = Patient who needs to be carried during both enplaning  and  deplaning.  Patient  requires  assistance  to  enplane  and  deplane.  Ambulatory  = Patient capable of walking who may not require assistance to enplane and deplane. Air cargo— Stores, equipment or vehicles, which do not form part of the aircraft, and are part or all  of  its  payload.  Note:  There  are  different  classifications  of  military  cargo,  categorized  as follows: Bulk Air Cargo, including the 463L pallet itself, that is within the usable dimensions of a 463L pallet (104‖ x 84‖ x 96‖) and within the height and width requirements established by the cargo envelope of the particular model of aircraft.  Oversize Cargo exceeding the usable dimensions of a 463L pallet loaded to the design height of 96‖ but is equal to or less than 1,090‖ in length, 117‖ in width, and 105‖ in height. This cargo is transportable on the C—5, C-17, C-130, and to a limited extent the KC-10. Outsize Cargo which exceeds the dimension of oversize (1,090‖ x 117‖ x 105‖) and requires use of a C—5 or C-17. Rolling Stock Equipment that can be driven or rolled directly into the cargo compartment.  Special  Items requiring specialized preparation and handling procedures, such as space satellites or nuclear weapons.  Aircraft block speed— True airspeed in knots under zero wind conditions adjusted in relation to length of sortie to compensate for takeoff, climb out, descent, instrument approach, and landing. AFPAM10-1403  12 DECEMBER 2011   25  Aircraft  parking  size— The ramp space a particular aircraft occupies, usually expressed in C-17 equivalents (See Table 2.). Airfield  database  (AFD)—  The  airfield  database  is  contained  in  the  AMC  Global  Decision Support  System  (GDSS)  and  establishes  suitability  and  restrictions  for  AMC  and  AMC-gained C-5, KC-10, C-17, C-130, and KC-135 aircraft operations. Airfield  Suitability  and  Restrictions  Report  (ASRR)—  AMC/A3  quarterly  publication available  on  line  that  contains  AMC  policy  and  guidance  regarding  airfield  suitability  and  a synopsis of suitability for airfields AMC operates at globally. Airfield  throughput  capability—  The  amount  of  passengers  or  cargo  which  can  be  moved through the  airfield per  day  via strategic airlift  based on the limitations of the  airfield (such as parking spots). Air refueling track— A track designated for air refueling reserved by the receiver unit/planner. If possible, the track from  the ARIP to  the ARCP should be along a TACAN/VORTAC radial and within 100 NM of the station. Air  refueling  initial  point  (ARIP)—  A  point  located  upstream  from  the  ARCP  at  which  the receiver aircraft initiates a rendezvous with the tanker. Air refueling control point (ARCP)— The planned geographic point over which the receiver(s) arrive in the observation/precontact position with respect to the assigned tanker. Air refueling control time (ARCT)— The planned time that the receiver and tanker will arrive over the air refueling control point (ARCP). Air  refueling  exit  point  (AR  EXIT  PT)—  The  designated  geographic  point  at  which  the refueling  track  terminates.  In  a  refueling  anchor  it  is  a  designated  point  where  the  tanker  and receiver may depart the anchor area after refueling is completed. Allowable cabin load (ACL)— The maximum payload that can be carried on a mission. Note: The ACL may be limited by the maximum takeoff gross weight, maximum landing gross weight, or by the maximum zero fuel weight. Anchor point— A designated geographical point on the downstream end of the inbound course of the Anchor Refueling Pattern. Anchor refueling— Air refueling performed as the tankers maintain a prescribed pattern which is anchored to a geographical point or fix. Anchor  rendezvous  (Anchor  Rendezvous)—  The  procedures  normally  employed  by  radar (CRC/GCI/AWACS) to vector the tanker(s) and receiver(s) for a visual join-up for refueling. Base  air  refueling  altitude— A reference altitude at  which lead aircraft of a tanker formation (or single aircraft for individual air refueling) will fly at initial contact. Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF)— A program in which the Department of Defense (DOD) uses FAA Part 121-certificated, US-flagged aircraft. These aircraft are allocated by the Department of Transportation  (DOT)  to  augment  the  military  airlift  capability  of  the  DOD.  These  aircraft  are allocated,  in  accordance  with  DOD  requirements,  to  segments,  according  to  their  capabilities, such as International, Domestic, and Aeromedical segments as may be mutually agreed upon by the DOD and the DOT. The CRAF can be incrementally activated by the DOD in three stages in   26  AFPAM10-1403  12 DECEMBER 2011 response  to  defense-oriented  situations,  up  to  and  including  a  declared  national  emergency  or war, to satisfy DOD airlift requirements. Note: The International segment is further divided into long-range and short-range sections; and the Domestic segment is further divided into National and Alaskan sections. Closure— In transportation, the process of a unit arriving at a specified location. It begins when the first element arrives at a designated location, e.g. port of entry/port of departure, intermediate stops,  or  final  destination,  and  ends  when  the  last  element  does  likewise,  For  the  purposes  of studies and command post exercises, a unit is considered essentially closed after 95 percent of its movement requirements for personnel and equipment are completed. Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATT)— CCATTs provide critical care augmentation to  aeromedically  evacuated  injured,  ill  and/or  burn  patients  requiring  advanced  care  during transportation.    They  are  available  to  assist  the  AE  crews  if  a  patient‘s  condition  dictates.  A CCATT intensivist (cardiopulmonary), a critical care nurse, and a respiratory technician. three  personnel:  a  physician  who  may  be  an is  comprised  of Cycle  time— Total  elapsed time for an aircraft to depart home station, fly  a complete mission and be back to start a second time. Dual role mission— A mission where both air refueling and airlift are provided to the user. The primary  mission  role  is  normally  air  refueling.  Missions  where  cargo  movement  is  primary require a dedicated funded special assignment airlift mission (SAAM). Enroute  rendezvous—  A  rendezvous  procedure  whereby  the  tanker  and  receiver  arrive  at  a common rendezvous (RZ) point at the same time with 1,000 feet altitude separation. Fleet  capability—  The  amount  of  cargo  or  passengers  which  can  be  moved  into  or  out  of  a location  or  theater  expressed  in  short  tons  or  PAX  per  day.  Limitations  include  the  number  of aircraft in the operation, their UTE rate, and the distance between onload and offload locations. Fuel MOG— See Maximum on Ground. Global Decision Support System (GDSS)— GDSS is AMC's force level command and control (C2) system supporting 618th Tanker Airlift Control Center (618 TACC) execution authority for effective airlift mission management. It provides AMC accurate, near real-time data required for making  decisions  concerning  the  deployment  and  employment  of  AMC  resources.    New accounts  may  be  obtained  by  following  the  "GDSS2  Accounts"  guidance  on  the  support  web site: https://gdss2ams.c2.amc.af.mil/gdss2web/ Ground time— The planned ground time for the type of aircraft used. Maximum on ground (MOG)— It is most commonly expressed in C-17 equivalents. Parking MOG— The number of aircraft that can fit, or be parked, on the ground. Working  MOG—    The  number  of  parked  aircraft  can  be  worked  simultaneously  based  on available personnel, materials handling equipment (MHE), and ramp space. Missions required— The number of strategic airlift missions (by aircraft type) required to move a requirement from the onload to the offload location. AFPAM10-1403  12 DECEMBER 2011   27  Noncombatant  evacuation  operation  (NEO)—  Operations  conducted  to  relocate  threatened noncombatants  from  locations  in  a  foreign  country.  These  operations  normally  involve  US citizens whose lives are in danger, and may also include selected foreign nationals. Note: NEO planning factors (refer to Table 3.) should be used when planning NEO operations. Emergency NEO capabilities represent the most extreme of circumstances.  Number of aircraft— The specific number of aircraft apportioned to any peacetime operation, contingency,  or  exercise,  or  the  number  apportioned  in  the  Joint  Strategic  Capabilities  Plan (JSCP) Enclosure 11 for tasked OPLANs. Pavement/Aircraft classification system— The ICAO standard method of reporting pavement strengths.  The  Pavement  Classification  Number  (PCN)  is  established  by  an  engineering assessment  of  the  runway.    The  PCN  is  for  use  in  conjunction  with  an  Aircraft  Classification Number (ACN). ACN values (provided in Table 1.) relate aircraft characteristics to a runway‘s load  bearing  capability,  expressed  as  a  PCN.  An  aircraft  with  an  ACN  equal  or  less  than  the reported PCN can operate on the pavement subject to any limitations on the tire pressure. Refer to DOD Flight Information Publication (Enroute Supplement) for an airfield‘s specific PCN. Payload— The sum of the weight of passengers and cargo that an aircraft can carry. Note: Cargo weight is normally expressed in short tons. Planning  payload—  The  payload  (expressed  in  short  tons  of  cargo  or  number  of  passengers) expected  on  a  fleet-wide  basis,  and  used  by  planners  to  make  initial  gross  planning  estimates. The size, shape, and density of most payloads, as well as passenger constraints (i.e., oxygen or life preservers available), rarely permit loading to 100 percent capacity. Planning payload data, not maximum payload data, should be used for operations/transportation planning. Point  parallel  rendezvous—  A  rendezvous  accomplished  with  the  tanker  maintaining  an appropriate offset, the receiver flying the ARIP to ARCP track, and the tanker turning in front of the receiver at a computed range. Primary mission aircraft inventory (PMAI)— Aircraft authorized to a unit for performance of its operational mission. The Primary authorization forms the basis for the allocation of operating resources to include manpower, support equipment, and flying hours funds. Productivity factor— Gross measure of an aircraft‘s expected useful ability to move cargo and passengers  to  a  user,  expressed  as  a  percentage.  Positioning,  depositioning,  and  other  non-productive legs all diminish the overall productivity. For example, on a strategic airlift mission involving an outbound and a return leg, the return leg is normally considered nonproductive. The productivity factor, in  this  case would be 50 percent.  However, this assumes cargo has already been positioned at the aircraft‘s departure point. In most situations, airlift aircraft must fly one or more positioning legs to an onload location. Since productive cargo is usually not moved at this time, these positioning legs reduce the overall productivity factor to a value less than 50 percent. For planning purposes use the productivity, factors found in  Table  7, or calculate your own by dividing productive leg distance (onload to offload) by round trip cycle distance.  Queuing  efficiency—  A  factor  used  by  planners  and  applied  in  formulas  (i.e.,  throughput capability)  to  account  for  the  physical  impossibility  of  using  limited  airfield  facilities  with perfect efficiency. For example, when a parking spot is vacated, it is never instantly re-occupied. Historically, planners have applied a queuing efficiency of 85 percent.   28  AFPAM10-1403  12 DECEMBER 2011 Requirement— Airlift. The force to be moved in number of passengers or short tons of cargo.   Tanker. The number and type of receivers, fuel desired, time to loiter, and AR track.   Round  trip  flying  time  (RTFT)—  The  accumulated  flying  time  from  the  aircraft‘s  starting point, to the onload location, through the en route structure, to the offload location, back through the en route system, to starting point of origin or other final destination. Round  trip  ground  time  (RTGT)— The accumulated ground time from the aircraft‘s starting point, to the onload location, through the en route structure, to the offload location, back to the final destination. Short Ton (Ston)— 2,000 pounds. Time  to  arrival— The time required for cargo/PAX to  arrive at the offload location including all en route ground times. USE  rate—  The  capability  of  a  subset  of  PMAI  aircraft  to  generate  flying  hours  expressed  in average flying hours per aircraft per day. Computed only for those aircraft applied to a specific mission.  For  example,  consider  an  operation  using  2  C-17  aircraft.  If  1  aircraft  flies  10  hours while the other is in maintenance, then one aircraft has 10 hours of USE rate and the other has 0 hours of USE rate.  Collectively, these two aircraft generate 5.0 hrs/day of ―USE‖. Utilization rate (UTE rate)— The capability of a fleet of aircraft to generate flying hours in a day, expressed in terms of per Primary Authorized Inventory (PAI). Applies only to long-term, large scale operations such as OPLANs. For small operations involving less than the entire fleet, UTE rates are not normally a factor. Wartime  Objective  “Surge”  UTE  Rate—  A  command  established  flying  hour  goal  for planning  and  programming  to  meet  JCS  directed  wartime  objectives  in  the  first  45  days  of  the most  demanding  wartime  operations.  AMC  sets  this  rate  as  a  target  for  planning  and programming aircrews, maintenance, and aerial port manpower, active and reserve force mixes, and spare parts. This early 45 day surge period assumes the deferral of scheduled maintenance, support people working overtime, and the full mobilization of both active and reserve forces with fully funded and fully stocked spares in supply.  Wartime Objective “Sustained” UTE Rate— Sustained UTE rates represent another command goal for planning purposes. After a 45 day surge operation in wartime, the immediate demand for airlift  decreases  somewhat  and  a  greater  percentage  of  needed  equipment  arrives  by sealift/surface. AMC plans to fly at a lower operational tempo known as a sustained UTE rate. This reduced rate is based upon normal duty days, 100% active and reserve participation, and the accomplishment of maintenance activities deferred in the surge period. Contingency  Non—Mobilized  UTE  Rate  =  Sustained  rate  of  flying  hour  activity  based  upon full  active  duty  participation  and  25%  reserve  volunteerism.  (e.g.  JUST  CAUSE,  RESTORE HOPE, PROVIDE COMFORT).  AFPAM10-1403  12 DECEMBER 2011   29
