The  CFETP  is  a  comprehensive  education  and  training  document  that  identifies  life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources and minimum core task requirements for  this  specialty.    The  CFETP  will  provide  Public  Affairs  personnel  a  clear  career  path  to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.  Note:  Civilians occupying associated positions may use Part II to support duty position qualification training.  Air Force Reserve  Command  (AFRC)  and  Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  career  paths  will  differ  from  the career  paths  depicted  in  this  document.    They  may  develop  career  paths  that  more  accurately describe the life-cycle of reserve and guard personnel. 2.    The  CFETP  consists  of  two  parts;  both  parts  of  the  plan  are  used  by  supervisors  to  plan, manage and control training within the career field. 2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains  how  everyone  will  use  the  plan;  Section  B  identifies  career  field  progression information,  duties  and  responsibilities,  training  strategies  and  career  field  path;  Section  C associates  each  level  with  specialty  qualifications  (knowledge,  education,  training  and  other); Section D indicates resource constraints (some examples are funds, manpower, equipment and facilities); Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt. 2.2.  Part II includes the following:  Section A identifies the STSs and includes duties, tasks, technical  references  to  support  training,  Air  Education  and  Training  Command  (AETC) conducted training, wartime course, core task and correspondence course requirements; Section B  identifies  the  course  objective  list;  Section  C  identifies  available  support  materials  (an example  is  a  Qualification  Training  Package  (QTP)  which  may  be  developed  to  support proficiency  training  and  they  are  identified  in  http://www.e-publishing.af.mil);  Section  D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training  (included  here  are  both  mandatory  and  optional  courses);  Section  E  identifies  Major Command’s  (MAJCOM)  unique  training  requirements  supervisors  can  use  to  determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs. 3.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in Public Affairs specialties receive  effective  and  efficient  training  at  the  appropriate  point  in  their  career.    This  plan  will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.  At unit-level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.       4   ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED 3N0  Designations.    3N0XX  includes  Public  Affairs  specialties,  3N0X2,  3N0X5  and  3N090 AFSCs; does not include 3N000.  3N03X, 3N05X and 3N07X refer to the skill level progression for the respective specialty (i.e. 3N03X = 3N032 and 3N035).

Section A, General Information  1.    Purpose.    The  CFETP  provides  information  necessary  for  AFCFM,  MFMs,  commanders, training  managers,  supervisors  and  trainers  to  plan,  develop,  manage  and  conduct  effective career  field  training  programs.    This  plan  outlines  the  training  that  individuals  in  these  AFSs should  receive  in  order  to  develop  and  progress  throughout  their  career.    This  plan  identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers.  UGT identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7- and 9-skill levels.  QT is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the UGT process.  It is  designed  to  provide  the  performance  skills/knowledge  required  to  do  the  job.    Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected Airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training,  either  in-residence  or  exportable  advanced  training  courses  or  OJT,  provided  to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes, some are: 1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct and evaluate a career field training program.    Also,  it  is  used  to  help  supervisors  identify  training  at  the  appropriate  point  in  an individual's career. 1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career. 10   1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training and the training delivery method. 1.4. Identifies major resource constraints which impact full implementation of the desired career field training process. 2.  Uses.  The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty. 2.1.  DINFOS  training  personnel  will  develop/revise  formal  resident,  non-resident,  field  and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  MAJCOM  FMs  will  ensure  their  training  programs  complement  the  CFETP  mandatory initial, upgrade and proficiency requirements.  Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident  training,  contract  training  or  exportable  courses.    MAJCOM-developed  training  to support these AFSCs must be identified for inclusion in the plan. 2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory  training requirements  specified in this plan.  The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 3.    Coordination  and  Approval.    The  AFCFM  is  the  approval  authority.    MAJCOM representatives  and  AETC  training  personnel  will  identify  and  coordinate  on  the  career  field training requirements.  The AETC training manager for 3N0XX specialties will initiate an annual review  of  this  document  by  (DINFOS)  AETC  and  MFMs  to  ensure  currency  and  accuracy.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.  Section B, Career Progression and Information  4.    Specialty  Descriptions.    Typically,  specialty  descriptions  provide  a  summary  of  the specialty, insight into duties and responsibilities associated to the specialty, and qualifications for entry or progression within the specialty.

Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level play an important role in the Air Force's ability to accomplish its mission.  It is essential that everyone involved in training must do their part to plan, manage and conduct an effective training program.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will 14   ensure  each  individual  receives  viable  training  at  appropriate  points  in  their  career.    The following narrative and AFSCs 3N0XX Career Development Flow Charts identify career skill progression. 5.1. Apprentice (3-skill level):  Upon completion of initial skills training, trainees work with a trainer  to  enhance  their  knowledge  and  skills.    Individuals  will  use  a  combination  of  Career Development  Courses  (CDCs),  OJT  and  advanced  courses  to  progress  in  the  career  field.  Education toward a CCAF degree should continue.  The goal for 5-skill level upgrade training is 24 months but must have a minimum of 12 months of OJT for all 3N0XX AFSCs. 5.2.  Journeyman  (5-skill  level):    Once  upgraded  to  the  5-level,  journeymen  will  enter  into continuation training to broaden their experience base.  5-levels will complete required available advanced  courses,  and  MAJCOM-specific  training.  Individuals  will  use  their  CDCs  and appropriate reference materials to prepare for testing under the Weighted Airman’s Promotions System (WAPS).  Education toward a CCAF degree should continue.   5.3.  Craftsman  (7-skill  level):    Craftsmen  can  expect  to  fill  various  supervisory  and management positions and may be assigned to higher headquarters staff positions and 3N0XX formal schools.  Personnel are encouraged to take additional courses to obtain added knowledge on management of resources and personnel.  Continue academic education through CCAF and higher degree programs.   5.4.  Superintendent  (9-skill  level):    A  9-level  is  expected  to  fill  leadership,  supervisory  and management positions and may be assigned to headquarters staff positions.  Additional training through  continuing  education  in  the  areas  of  budget,  manpower,  resources  and  personnel management is necessary.  The 9-skill level is awarded upon sew-on of Senior Master Sergeant.  Additional  higher  education  and  completion  of  courses  outside  the  career  AFSC  are  also recommended. 6.    Training  Decisions.    The  CFETP  uses  a  building  block  approach  (simple  to  complex)  to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Public Affairs career field.  The spectrum  includes  a  strategy  for  when,  where  and  how  to  meet  the  training  requirements.  Strategy  must  be  apparent  and  affordable  to  reduce  duplication  of  training  and  eliminate  a disjointed approach to training.  The CFETP was revised at the Specialty Training Requirements Teams (STRT) held in August 2014 in San Antonio, Texas. 6.1.  Initial  Skills  Training.    The  initial  skills  courses  were  revised  to  provide  the  training needed to better prepare graduates for the tasks they will be facing in the field. 6.2.  Upgrade  Training.    Completion  of  CDC  3N052  is  required  for  award  of  AFSC  3N052.  Completion of CDC 3N055 is required for award of AFSC 3N055.  Completion of CDC 3N07X is required for award of AFSC 3N07X. 7.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). Enrollment in CCAF occurs upon completion of Basic Military Training. CCAF provides the opportunity for all enlisted members to obtain an Associate in Applied Science degree. The  degree must be completed before the student separates from the Air Force, retires, or is commissioned as an officer.  7.1. Degree Program. The Mass Communications (2FDE) program applies to the 3N0X5 and 3N0X2 career fields.  7.2.  Legacy  Degrees.  Airmen  enrolled  in  the  Public  Affairs  (2FDE)  program  or  the  Multimedia Production Services (2IAJ) program before 1 January 2014 may complete those degrees or transfer to the Mass Communications program. 15                                 7.3.  Degree  Requirements.    The  journeyman  (5)  level  must  be  held  at  the  time  of  program completion and the following requirements must be met (see CCAF Online General Catalog link below for most current information):   Overall Requirements         Semester Hours Technical Education……………………………………………………………………………..24 Leadership, Management, and Military Studies…………………………………………………..6 Physical Education………………………………………………………………………………..4 General Education……………………………………………………………………………….15 Program Electives………………………………………………………………………………..15 Total        64  *Note: One-fourth (16) of the 64 credits must be earned from CCAF affiliated schools (residency credit).

Program Electives (15 Semester Hours): Satisfied with applicable Technical Education; Leadership, Management, and Military Studies; or General Education subjects/courses, including natural science courses meeting GER application criteria.  Nine semester hours of CCAF degree-applicable  technical  credit  otherwise  not  applicable  to  this  program  may  be  applied.  See  the applicable  General  Catalog  for  details  regarding  the  Associates  of  Applied  Science  for  this specialty. 7.4.  CCAF  General  Catalog.  The  current  CCAF  General  Catalog  contains  details  regarding  the Associates  in  Applied  Science  in  Mass  Communications.    The  catalog  is  available  at  your education officer or from http://www.au.af.mil/au/ccaf/. 7.5. Off-Duty Education. Additional off-duty education is a personal choice that is encouraged for all. Individuals desiring to become an Air Education and Training Command instructor should be actively pursuing an associate's degree. A degreed faculty is necessary to maintain accreditation through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.     16   8.  Public Affairs Career Path.  The following summarizes career progression and personnel allocations  across the career ladder.  3N0XX personnel maintain their individual AFSC identifiers through  the rank of MSgt.  Upon promotion to SMSgt, individuals holding the 3N0X2 AFSC merge with  3N0X5 to become 3N090.  Upon promotion to CMSgt, individuals holding  the 3N090 AFSC become 3N000.       3N Career Planning DiagramCMSAFSenior Developmental EdSNCOAProfessional EducationPAQC, VIM, JSPAC, BMCIntermediate Developmental EdNCOAProfessional EducationIPC, JIPAC, JEPAC, IOFAC, AEJCDevelopmental EdALSProfessional EdBPJC, BCSCFM, CCM,MFM, MSG Supt,Band CEM9-level7-levelCraftsman5-levelJourneyman3-levelApprentice      SAF/PAPA AdvisorMAJCOM, JointPA Supt, NAF Warplanner,SNCO DSD, Band DO, Resource AdvisorSection NCOIC, Operations NCOIC,Band Ensemble Leader DSD OpportunitiesPhotojournalist Broadcast Journalist Band InstrumentalistAccessions17   Table 8.1  Enlisted Career Path  Education and Training Requirements Basic Military Training School Apprentice Technical School (3-Skill Level) Upgrade To Journeyman (5-Skill Level) - Minimum 12 months OJT (9 months for retrainees), career field goal 24 months max - Complete appropriate CDC and/or 5-level course if/when available  - Complete all 5-level Core tasks  - Recommended by supervisor Airman Leadership School (ALS) - Must be a SrA with 48 months time in service or be a SSgt Selectee - Completion is a prerequisite for SSgt sew-on (Active Duty Only) Upgrade To Craftsman (7-Skill Level) - Minimum rank of SSgt - Minimum 12 months OJT (6 months for retrainees), career field goal 18 months max - Complete appropriate CDC and/or 7-level course if/when available  - Complete all 5-level Core tasks  - Recommended by supervisor Noncommissioned Officer Academy (NCOA) - Must be a TSgt, MSgt Selectee, or MSgt - Completion is a prerequisite for MSgt sew-on (Active Duty Only) Upgrade To Superintendent (9-Skill Level) - Minimum rank of SMSgt USAF Senior NCO Academy (SNCOA) -  Must be a MSgt, SMSgt, or SMSgt Selectee  - Completion is a prerequisite for SMSgt sew-on (Active Duty Only)                        Rank  Amn   A1C SrA GRADE REQUIREMENTS Average Sew-On Earliest Sew-On High Year Of Tenure (HYT) 6 months 16 months 3 years   28 months 8 Years Trainer - Recommended by the supervisor - Qualified to perform the task being trained - Attend the Air Force Training Course  SSgt 5 years 3 years 15 Years   TSgt 11.5 years 5 years 20 Years MSgt 16 years 8 years 24 Years SMSgt 19 years 11 years 26 Years 18   Section C, Skill Level Training Requirements  9.

Contains  the  proficiency  code  key  used  to  indicate  the  level  of  training  and  knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses. 2.6. Is used to document task completion within TBA. CFETP documentation shall be IAW AFI 36-2201, or any subsequent messages. Note:    Required  upgrade  training  “core  task(s)”  identified  by  local  unit,  as  “not  available  for training” must be annotated in TBA.  The 5- or 7-level skill can then be awarded when all other training and core tasks are complete. 2. 7. Assists in the development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  Senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields develop the Specialty Knowledge  Tests  (SKTs)  at  the  USAF  Occupational  Measurement  Squadron.  The  tests  sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for  promotion  to  higher  grades.  Questions  are  based  upon  study  references  listed  in  the  Enlisted Promotions Reference and Requirements Catalog (EPRRC).  Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System. 3. Transcribing.  Transcribing documentation to a new CFETP is an administrative function, not a re-evaluation of training.  Therefore, supervisor and trainer are considered synonymous for the purpose of documentation. Transcribe within 120 days (240 days for ARC) of CFETP revision date or from date revision is posted to automated training records system. 4.  Third-Party  Certification.    Core  tasks  identified  in  this  CFETP  do  not  require  third-party certification. 5.    Decertification  and  Recertification.    When  an  Airman  is  found  to  be  unqualified  on  a  task previously certified on for their duty position in TBA, the supervisor will take action to decertify the task  and  complete  Journal  Entry  IAW  the  TBA  Application  User’s  Guide,  Decertify  IPT  Task instructions.  23   6.  Training Standard.  Tasks  are  trained  and  qualified  to  the  “go/no  go”  level.    “Go”  means  the individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy, timeliness and correct use of procedures IAW AFI 36-2201.   7.  Recommendations.  Please submit all training-related comments and recommendations through appropriate command channels to SAF/PAR, 1690 Air Force Pentagon, Room 4B912, Washington D.C. 20330.

Needs to be told or shown how to do most of the task.  (Extremely Limited) Can do most parts of the task.  Needs only help on the hardest parts.  (Partially Proficient) Can do all parts of the task.  Needs only a spot check of completed work.  (Competent) Can do the complete task quickly and accurately.  Can tell or show other how to do the task.  (Highly Proficient) Can name parts, tools and simple facts about the task.  (Nomenclature) Can determine step by step procedures for doing the task.  (Procedures) Can identify why and when the task must be done and why each step is needed.  (operating Principles) Can predict, isolate and resolve problems about the task.  (Advanced Theory) Can identify basic facts and terms about the subject.  (Facts) Can identify relationship of basic facts and state general principles about the subject.  (Principles) Can analyze facts and principles and draw conclusions about the subject.  (Analysis)  Can evaluate conditions and make proper decisions about the subject.  (Evaluation)               Explanations: "*"  A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.  (Example: b and 1b) "**"  A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several task. "-"   This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC. "X"  This mark is used alone in course columns to show that training required but not given due to limitations in resources.   Note for Core/Wartime Task (Column 2): Items in Core/Wartime Tasks column marked with a symbol/character (5, 7, A, C and V) are mandatory “core” tasks that must be completed before the next skill level can be awarded.  Required up-grade training “core task(s)” identified by local unit, as “not available for training” must be annotated in TBA.  Comments regarding training availability may also be annotated in TBA.  The 5- or 7-skill level can then be awarded when all other training and core tasks are complete.   25    1. TASKS, KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNICAL REFERENCES     EMITRAW / EROC .2 SKSAT1.
