DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE Headquarters Air Force Washington DC 20330-1030 Air  Force Job  Qualification Standard 2XXXX  LRS  QA  Evaluator 20 March 2015Air Force Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS) Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) Quality Assurance (QA) Evaluator  (2FXXX, 2GXXX, 2SXXX, 2TXXX) ACCESSIBILITY:  Publications and forms are available on the e-publishing website at  www.e-publishing.af.mil for downloading or ordering. RELEASABILITY:  There are no releasability restrictions on this publication. 1. PURPOSE.  As directed by AFI 20-112, Logistics Readiness Squadron Quality AssuranceProgram, this AFJQS identifies the minimum training requirements to become a qualified LRS QA  evaluator (both military and civilian).  This AFJQS will be available in Training Business Area  (TBA) and must be used to develop the Master Training Plan (MTP) for the LRS QA Section  and the Individual Training Plans (ITP) for evaluators.  Specific applicability of this  AFJQS to ANG personnel is addressed in AFI 20-112.  This AFJQS will remain in effect until  superseded or rescinded. 2. TASK QUALIFICATION.  Personnel will be qualified to the GO/NO GO standard on thisAFJQS.  GO means the individual can perform the task without assistance utilizing appropriate instructions or other procedural guidance.  If the required training listed under Part II, Task #1 is  provided through web-based courses or trainers outside of TBA, a LRS QA trainer will complete  the trainer’s block to document training completion.  Task 1.3 is meant to be tailored training on  the 8-step problem solving process taught by the local AFSO21 office.  This is not required to be  full facilitator training but rather the basics of eight step problem solving to include root cause  analysis (4th step). 3. EVALUATOR PERSONNEL EVALUATIONS (EPE).  After the LOG 143 course (Task1.1)  is completed and on-the-job training on tasks 3.1 through 3.4 are accomplished, LRS QA Evaluators must pass three EPEs (Task 3.5) conducted by a fully qualified QA evaluator.  If fully  qualified QA evaluators do not reside within the LRS, the QA Manager will work with the local MXG  QA section for assistance with the necessary training and evaluations.  Each QA evaluator, permanent or augmentee  must pass the EPEs prior to performing unsupervised evaluations and inspections.  At a  minimum, a qualified evaluator must ensure that the inspector can execute the proper steps to  conduct an evaluation.  QA augmentees require an annual EPE on either a Personnel Evaluation (PE) or technical  inspection to remain qualified. 1 4.  TRAINING DOCUMENTATION AND TRAINER/CERTIFIER IDENTIFICATION. Document training required by this AFJQS in accordance with AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program and the TBA procedural guide available in the TBA application.  For civilians,  document civilian training on AF Form 971, Supervisor’s Employee Brief.  All trainers and certifiers authorized to sign off  tasks in Part II of this AFJQS will be identified in TBA.  Per AFI 36-2201, paragraph 6.9.8.1,  critical tasks in this particular AFJQS are defined as those tasks requiring third party  certification.  If a military trainee is assigned an additional duty or task not  included in an individual’s CFETP or this AFJQS, the supervisor will add the tasks to the MTP  and ITP.  Specific CFETP tasks that an evaluator is authorized to evaluate will be identified in  the evaluator’s ITP.  Specific QA training tasks for each Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) may be added to the  applicable CFETP by the individual Career Field Manager (CFM). 5.  This AFJQS has been coordinated with all applicable CFMs.  Overall POC for this AFJQS is  HAF/A4LR, DSN 612-4209, usaf.pentagon.af-a4.mbx.a4lr-workflow@mail.mil.
