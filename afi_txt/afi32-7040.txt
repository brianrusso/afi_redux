Overview.  It is Air Force policy to promote environmental stewardship in all activities to ensure  uninterrupted  access  to  the  air,  land,  and  water  assets  needed  to  conduct  the  Air  Force mission.    By  focusing  on  the  warfighter’s  operational  requirements  while  following  the regulatory  strictures  for  sustaining  resources  and  protecting  human  health,  the  Air  Quality Compliance and Resource Management Program (Air Quality Program) will sustain, restore, and modernize natural infrastructure assets. 1.2.  Mission.  The mission of the Air Quality Program is to: “Maintain mission support while effectively managing, sustaining and continually enhancing air quality natural infrastructure resources through regulatory compliance, regulatory risk minimization, professional competency, and pursuing emission reduction.” 1.3.  Objective.  The  Air  Quality  Compliance  and  Resource  Management  Program  identifies essential Air Force requirements and actions to manage Air Force air resource assets in order to maximize  their  military  value  and  optimize  their  economic,  ecologic,  and  community  value, while  attaining  and  maintaining  compliance  with  the  Clean  Air  Act  (CAA;  Title  42,  United States Code (U.S.C.) Sections 7401 et seq.) in addition to all applicable state and local air quality regulations, or for overseas installations, the host-nation FGS, or OEBGD (per DoD 4715.5-G) where no FGS exist, or any relevant obligations under a binding international agreement. 1.4.  Concept.  This instruction establishes a framework for all Commands to use in complying with  air  quality  requirements  and  AFPD  32-70,  Environmental  Quality.    All  references  to Commands in this AFI include the Air National Guard Readiness Center and other agencies that Headquarters,  U.S.  Air  Force  designates  as  “Major  Command  equivalent.”    As  needed, Commands will provide administrative and technical support to ensure installations comply with Air Force policies and regulatory requirements. Safety, (E.O.)  13693,  Planning and  Occupational  Health  Management 1.5.  Environment, System for  Federal (ESOHMS).  Consistent  with  Executive  Order Sustainability  in  the  Next  Decade;  DoDI  4715.17,  Environmental  Management  System;  AFPD 90-8, ESOH; and AFI 32-7001, Environmental Management, Air Force installations are directed to  have  an  EMS  to  sustain,  restore,  and  modernize  natural  and  built  infrastructure  to  support mission capability, as part of a larger undertaking toward an Air Force ESOHMS.  All Air Force installations and facilities will comply with E.O. 13693, DoDI 4715.17, and Air Force ESOHMS guidance.  (T-0).  The  Air  Quality  Program,  as  a  part  of  the  overall  ESOHMS,  seeks  to appropriately plan, implement and operate, check, and review, as necessary, the management of air  resources  to  ensure  mission  completion.    This  AFI  is  organized  to  align  with  that  cycle  of continual  improvement  in  progressive  chapters  for  Planning,  Implementation  and  Operation, Checking and Corrective Action, and Management Review (chapters 3 through 6). 6 AFI32-7040  4 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Installations will cite applicable emission/control/performance standards for  each  project  requiring  specification  or  installation  of  equipment  for  control  of  regulated  air pollutants  to  ensure  that  the  proposed  control  technology  meets  air  quality  compliance requirements. (T-0) 3.3.1.  New major sources located in areas designated as attaining NAAQS require utilization of Best Available Control Technology (BACT).  Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT)  Standards  are  technology-based  air  emission  standards  established  to  reduce emissions  of  hazardous  air  pollutants  (HAPs);  the  standards  for  smaller  (area)  sources  are called Generally Available Control Technology (GACT). Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) is required on new or modified major sources in nonattainment areas.  Reasonably Available  Control  Technology  (RACT)  is  required  for  existing  sources  in  nonattainment areas, and in most cases, is less stringent than New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) or BACT. 3.4.  Conformity  Rule  Planning  (applicable  to  all  installations  under  the  regulatory oversight  of  the  EPA).  Conformity  Rules  (40  CFR  Part  93,  Subpart  B,  and  any  applicable state/tribal  regulations  promulgated  per  40  CFR  §  51.851)  apply  only  to  federal  actions  in nonattainment and maintenance areas.  Installations will ensure all Conformity Rule planning is accomplished  IAW  the  current  Air  Force  Air  Quality  EIAP  Guide  maintained  by  AFCEC/CZ, and meets the requirements of the CAA, Section 176(c)(1) and 40 CFR Part 93, Subpart A, for federal highway and transit actions, or 40 CFR Part 93, Subpart B, for all other actions.  (T-0) 3.4.1.  Before  implementing  any  federal  action  in  an  air  quality  nonattainment  or maintenance  area,  the  installation  or  other  proponent  (with  assistance  from  AFCEC/CZ, ANG, and AFRC) shall complete a General Conformity applicability analysis per 40 CFR §§ 93.153(b)  and  (c),  and  a  General  Conformity  determination  per  40  CFR  §  93.154  (if applicable), to ensure the action does not interfere with a state’s plan to attain and maintain the  NAAQSs  (known  as  State  Implementation  Plans  or  SIPs).  (T-0).  IAW  CAA,  Section 176(c),  any  action  that  negatively  affects  the  implementation  or  goals  of  the  SIP  is  not allowed  to  proceed.  Installations  will  ensure  all  EIAP  documents  address  applicable conformity  requirements  and  the  status  of  compliance.  (T-0).  Conformity  applicability analyses and determinations are developed in parallel with EIAP documents, but are separate and distinct requirements and should be documented separately. To increase the utility of a conformity  determination  in  performing  the  EIAP,  the  conformity  determination  should  be completed  prior  to  the  completion  of  the  EIAP  so  as  to  allow  incorporation  of  the information from the conformity determination into the EIAP decision process. 3.4.2.  As  an  initial  part  of  the  planning  process,  the  proponent  (with  assistance  from  the AFCEC/CZ,  ANG,  and  AFRC)  shall  perform  a  General  Conformity  Applicability  Analysis using  the  Air  Conformity  Applicability  Model  (ACAM)  or  other  A4C  approved  automated air  quality  impact  assessment  tool  (T-0).  If  ACAM  (or  other  approved  tool)  determines General  Conformity  is  applicable,  the  proponent  (with  assistance  from  the  AFCEC/CZ, ANG,  and  AFRC)  will  perform  and  approve  a  conformity  determination  before  the  EIAP process is completed. (T-0) AFI32-7040  4 NOVEMBER 2014 19 3.4.2.1.  Proponents  shall  prepare  required  conformity  documents  in  coordination  with the  installation  and  AFCEC/CZs.  (T-0).  AFCEC/CZ  will  transmit  draft  conformity determinations  to  HQ  USAF/A4C  for  higher  HQ  coordination  and  SAF/IEE  approval, prior to release for public review.  (T-0) 3.4.2.2.  Currently,  SAF/IEE  is  the  lowest  level  of  signature  authority  designated  for  a General Conformity determination. 3.5.  Environmental  Impact  Analysis  Process  (EIAP)  Planning  (applicable  to  all installations  under  the  regulatory  oversight  of  the  EPA).  NEPA  requires  the  responsible federal  official  to  consult  with  and  obtain  the  comments  of  any  federal  agency  that  has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with  respect  to  any environmental impact.  Proponents/ installations/MAJCOMs will ensure all NEPA/EIAP planning is accomplished IAW 32 CFR Part 989 and 40 CFR Parts 1500-1508, the most current Air Force Air Quality EIAP Guide issued by AFCEC/CZ, and must meet the requirements of the CAA Section 176(c), 32 CFR Part 989, and 40 CFR Parts 1500-1508.

Before implementing any federal action (regardless of the air  quality  attainment  status)  the  proponent  (with  assistance  from  the  AFCEC/CZ)  shall complete  an  Air  Quality  Impacts  Analysis  (AQIA)  that  analyzes  and  discloses  all  of  the ambient air impacts and any permit requirements involving any attainment criteria pollutant emissions, HAP emissions, and emissions of any other regulated pollutants under the CAA, such as ozone depleting substances (ODS), that result from the proposed action. (T-0).  The AQIA includes an initial screening of the net change in emissions using the ACAM (or other approved tool). (T-0) 3.5.2.  Conformity Rules:   According to  32 CFR § 989.30, all EIAP  documents address  the CAA Conformity Rule requirements. Proponents ensure a General Conformity applicability analysis  and  a  General  Conformity  determination  (if  applicable),  is  completed  prior  to  the completion of the EIAP in order to allow incorporation of the information into the EIAP and allow  for  the  agency  and  public  review.  Where  required,  proponents  must  complete conformity  determinations  simultaneously  with  EIAP  decision  documents,  otherwise  the action becomes delayed. (T-0) 3.6.  Preconstruction  New  Source  Review  (NSR)  (applicable  to  all  installations  under  the regulatory  oversight  of  the  EPA).  In  the  early  planning  phase  for  any  construction  (i.e., construction, renovation, or major equipment  addition/modification) project, the proponent of a proposed construction project shall consult with the CEIE on any NSR requirements. (T-0). The CEIE  shall  evaluate  the  proposed  project  based  on  the  PTE  IAW  the  applicable  local,  state, and/or  federal  rules  that  make  up  the  appropriate  nonattainment  NSR  or  Prevention  of Significant  Deterioration  (PSD)  program  under  the  regulations  contained  in  40  CFR  §51.165, §51.166, §52.21, §52.24, and/or 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix S. (T-0) 3.6.1.  There  are  three  types  of  permits  that  can  be  issued  under  NSR  for  either  new  or modified sources: 3.6.1.1.  Prevention  of  Significant  Deterioration  (PSD)  Permits  apply  to  new  major sources  or  major  modifications  at  existing  sources  in  areas  designated  attainment  or unclassifiable  for  a  particular  NAAQS  (See  local,  state,  and/or  federal  program  rules promulgated under 40 CFR §§ 51.166 and/or 52.21). For specific source categories a new 20 AFI32-7040  4 NOVEMBER 2014 major source has a PTE of 100 tons per year or more, otherwise the threshold is set at 250 tons  per  year.  Thresholds  for  modifications  at  existing  major  sources  vary  according  to the  regulated  pollutant.  For  example,  the  significance  threshold  for  Ozone  depleting substances (ODSs) at existing major sources is zero, while the significance threshold for Nitrous  Oxides  (NOx)  is  40  tons/year.  Application  of  BACT  is  required  to  control emissions. 3.6.1.2.  Nonattainment NSR Permits apply to new major sources or major modifications to existing sources in areas designated nonattainment or maintenance for the NAAQS as well  as  in  attainment  areas  within  an  Ozone  Transport  Region  (See  local,  state,  and/or federal  program  rules  promulgated  under  40  CFR  §§  51.165  and  52.24  and/or  40  CFR Part  51,  Appendix  S).  Thresholds  for  new  major  sources  and  major  modifications  vary from 10 tons/year to 100 tons/year, depending on the area’s classification or severity of nonattainment. Application of the LAER technology is required to control emissions. 3.6.1.3.  Minor  NSR  Permits  apply  to  stationary  sources  that  do  not  require  PSD  or Nonattainment  NSR  permits.    They  may  contain  enforceable  conditions  that  limit emissions or operating conditions in order to create “synthetic minor” sources that are not subject to PSD or nonattainment NSR requirements. 3.6.2.  Process  owners  responsible  for  projects  which  will  create  new  major  stationary sources of air pollution or process owners making any major modifications to existing major stationary  sources  will  ensure  air  permits  are  obtained  IAW  40  CFR  Part  51,  Subpart  I, before commencing construction activities. (T-0). 3.7.  Utilizing  Air  Emission  Reduction  Credits  in  Planning  (applicable  to  all  installations under the regulatory oversight of the EPA).  The CEIE, with assistance from AFCEC/CZ, will pursue EPA and/or the state economic incentive programs (EIPs) to control/reduce air emissions to acquire ERCs whenever possible. (T-0).  The CEIE shall report ERCs received to AFCEC/CZ for  tracking.  (T-0).  More  detailed  information  on  Air  Force  generation,  use  and  disposition  of ERCs is provided in the Air ForceictectAir Quality EIAP Guide Volume II. 3.8.  Planning  for  Military-Unique  Sources  (applicable  to  all  installations,  including overseas).  Where  military-unique  sources  exist,  obtain  the  most  recent  information  on  EPA, DoD, and Air Force policy and guidelines regarding air resource management strategies for these sources.   The CEIE  will report any  new military-unique sources they encounter to  AFCEC/CZ for evaluation and specific guidance. (T-1) 3.9.  Risk  Management  Planning  (applicable  to  all  installations  under  the  regulatory oversight of the EPA).  The CEIE will develop a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for stationary sources that have more than a threshold quantity of regulated hazardous or extremely hazardous substance under 40 C.F.R. Part 68 or applicable state law. (T-0). Additionally, all RMPs must be revised and resubmitted to EPA every five  years. (T-0).  All stationary sources are subject to a “general duty” to plan for, prevent, and minimize the consequences of any accidental releases of extremely hazardous chemicals under § 112(r)(1) of the CAA. 3.10.  Episode  Planning  applicable  to  all  installations,  including  overseas).  Where required under  40  CFR  Part  51,  Subpart  H,  Prevention  of  Air  Pollution  Emergency  Episodes,  the  CEIE must  develop  and  implement  a  contingency  plan  for  air  pollution  emergency  episodes  which AFI32-7040  4 NOVEMBER 2014 21 identifies  all  actions  that  can  reasonably  be  taken  without  compromising  essential  services  and mission responsibilities. (T-0) 3.11.  Emergency  Planning (applicable to all  installations,  including overseas).  Follow AFI 10-2501,    Air  Force  Emergency  Management  (EM)  Program  Planning  and  Operations,  for emergency planning and response to major accidents; natural disasters; terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction; and nuclear, biological, chemical, and conventional warfare. 22 AFI32-7040  4 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 4 IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION 4.1.  General Program Guidelines.  In order to assure uninterrupted mission accomplishment at an  installation,  it  is  important  that  an  Air  Quality  Program  governing  the  operation  of  all stationary  and  mobile  sources  of  air  pollution  be  maintained  at  all  Air  Force  installations  to assess,  attain,  and  maintain  compliance  with  all  applicable  federal,  state,  and  local  air  quality regulations  and  permits.  The  Installation  Civil  Engineering  office  is  assigned  the  responsibility of  carrying  out  Air  Quality  compliance  activities  with  direct  operational  oversight  and  support from  the  AFCEC.    At  a  minimum,  the  program  includes  establishing  robust  recordkeeping, reporting, and monitoring processes;  maintaining  and actively  using emissions inventories; and identification  and  documentation  of  trivial,  de  minimis,  and  otherwise  insignificant  or  exempt sources. 4.2.  Air Emissions Inventory (AEI).  The CEIE must prepare and periodically update an AEI, using APIMS, of all installation stationary sources (stationary source AEI) and Air Force owned or  operated  mobile  sources  (mobile  source  AEI)  IAW  the  current  Air  Force  air  emissions inventory guidance and applicable state or local requirements promulgated per 40 CFR Part 51 Subpart A, Air Emissions Reporting Requirements. (T-0) 4.2.1.  Comprehensive AEIs (i.e., includes both permitted and non-permitted sources) are performed at  the frequency  as  required by  federal,  state and local  regulations. Overseas installations  conduct  AEIs  IAW  Foreign  Governing  Standards  and/or  Host  Nation agreements.  At  a  minimum,  the  CEIE,  will  annually  review/validate  APIMS  as  current (i.e., sources and consumption  data is  representative of the current  base conditions) and update (i.e., a comprehensive review of all sources and their  consumption data) at least every  three  years  (five  years  for  overseas  and  remotely  located  facilities)  to  accurately reflect current emissions. (T-1). 4.2.2.  Stationary source AEIs include all criteria pollutants, HAPs, and GHGs and reflect the installation’s current actual and PTE emissions.  Annual regulatory emissions reports, a  subset  of  the  comprehensive  AEI,  are  provided  to  federal,  state  and  local  (including Metropolitan  Planning  Organization  or  other  regional)  regulatory  agencies  as  required.  Mandatory pollutant emissions reporting is provided to AFCEC/CZ as part of the annual data call. GHG reporting mandated by E.O. 13693, is accomplished at the HAF level. 4.2.3.  Affected  installations  that  exceed  the  GHG  reporting  threshold  shall  accomplish GHG reporting mandated by Title 40 CFR Part 98, Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases.  (T-0).    Other  installations  within  10%  of  the  GHG  reporting  threshold  shall accomplish  GHG  estimates  IAW  Title  40  CFR  Part  98  and  only  report  the  results  to AFCEC/CZ via APIMS. (T-1).  Installation AEI data stored in APIMS are available for use as needed by AFCEC and higher headquarters. 4.3.  Title  V  and  State  Operating  Permits  (applicable  to  all  installations  under  the regulatory oversight of the EPA, state, or local air pollution control authorities).  Facilities formally designated as a major source must obtain a Title V Operating Permit. (T-0) AFI32-7040  4 NOVEMBER 2014 23 4.3.1.  Each  time  a  facility’s  PTE  is  reestablished,  the  CEIE  must  make  a  major  source determination  by  comparing  the  facility’s  PTE  against  the  applicable  criteria  pollutant and/or HAP major source thresholds under 40 CFR Part 70 and 40 CFR 71. (T-0) 4.3.2.  If  the  determination  concludes  the  facility’s  PTE  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the applicable  criteria  pollutant  and/or  HAP  thresholds,  the  CEIE  shall  consult  with AFCEC/CZ  (or  ANG  and  AFRC  for  Guard  and  Reserve  units  respectively)  for  review and validation of the determination. (T-0). Unless the permitting authority takes specific exception,  the  CEIE  must  have  performed  the  PTE  and  determination  IAW  the  PTE guidance  within  the  current  Air  Force  air  emissions  guidance  and  the  EPA  guidance memorandum,  Major  Source  Determinations  for  Military  Installations  under  the  Air Toxics,  New  Source  Review,  and  Title  V  Operating  Permit  Programs  of  the  Clean  Air Act, John Seitz, 2 August 96. (T-0) 4.3.3.  If  an  installation  can  bring  itself  under  major  source  emission  thresholds  by accepting self-imposed federally enforceable limits on PTE without negatively impacting the mission, the installation considers the pros and cons of applying for a synthetic minor permit instead of a Title V operating permit.  Facilities must ensure that inventories are current in order to maintain non-Title V permit status. (T-0). 40 CFR § 70.5(a)(1)(i) (or 40 CFR § 71.5(a)(1)(i) requires installations, that become subject to  Title V permits, to file an application within one year of becoming a Title V source.  States are authorized to establish a shorter time period for this requirement. 4.3.4.  Installations  shall  forward  any  major  source  or  synthetic  minor  determination  to AFCEC/CZ  for  final  review/validation  (Guard  and  Reserve  units  forward  through  the ANG and AFRC respectively). (T-1). Upon final validation by AFCEC/CZ, installations (with  AFCEC/CZ  assistance),  or  the  ANG  and  AFRC  for  Guard  and  Reserve  units respectively, are responsible for obtaining the appropriate permits. 4.4.  Mobile  Sources  (applicable  to  all  installations,  including  overseas).  The  CEIE,  in concert  with  the  installation  vehicle  maintenance  shop  (A4L  Logistics  Readiness)  shall  ensure that motorized Air Force vehicles and portable equipment are operated, refueled, and maintained IAW all applicable federal, state and local requirements. (T-0) 4.4.1.  Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) (applicable to all installations located in areas where an EPA SIP approved I/M program is in effect).  Installations ensure that all Air Force fleet vehicles and privately owned vehicles (POVs) operated on the installation comply with non-discriminatory motor vehicle I/M programs that apply under §118 of the CAA. 4.4.1.1.  Installation Commanders ensure, if CAA §118 is applicable to their installation, that  employee  owned  vehicles  driven  on  the  installation  are  in  compliance  with  the installation  I/M  Program  requirements.    Under  the  installation  I/M  Program,  Federal employees  operating  POVs  on  the  installation  are  required  (regardless  of  where  the employee’s vehicle is registered) to self-certify (using the Employee-Vehicle Certification and  Reporting  System,  ECARS)  their  compliance  status  with  the  local  area  I/M requirements. (T-1) 4.4.1.2.  For  all  Air  Force  facilities  located  in  an  area  with  an  applicable  vehicle  I/M program,  commanders  are  required  by  42  U.S.C.  §  7418(d)  to  ensure  that  employees 24 AFI32-7040  4 NOVEMBER 2014 provide proof of  compliance  with  the local  (or an equivalent)  I/M  program  for vehicles that the employees operate on the affected facility. 4.4.1.3.  All  employees  assigned  to  the  affected  facility  for  more  than  60  days  shall certify  compliance  (and  periodically  recertify  compliance)  by  digitally  signing  the  Air Force Form 4434, available in the ECARS module of APIMS. (T-1). The Air Force Form 4434  is  maintained  on  the  ECARS  server  while  the  employee  is  assigned  to  the installation, or for the duration of the registration period, whichever is shorter.  Hard copy Air Force  Form 4434 may  be used in  lieu of the electronic ECARS in  situations  where government employees are not identified in the Air Force Personnel System, such as non-Air Force employees on an Air Force hosted installation (e.g., DCMA employees). 4.4.1.4.  All  employee  vehicle  operators  shall  maintain  documentation  of  compliance with  the  applicable  I/M  program  requirements  while  operating  their  vehicle  on  the affected facility, and supply such documentation as required by the facility. (T-1) 4.4.1.5.  When  an  Air  Force  facility  is  located  in  an  area  that  becomes  subject  to  an applicable  I/M  program,  the  Installation  Commander  shall  adopt  a  program  which complies with that program, to include implementation of ECARS. (T-0). Generally, the base program should be adopted within 90 days of the effective date of the applicable I/M program. 4.4.2.  Clean  Fuel  and  Vapor  Recovery  (wherever  applicable).    Employees  operating  Air Force  vehicles  and  equipment  in  areas  subject  to  EPA  or  California  clean,  reformulated, oxygenated  or  ultra-low  sulfur  fuel  requirements,  and  Stage  II  vapor  recovery  programs, must ensure that compliant fuels and equipment are used during vehicle refueling operations, and that fuel pumps are labeled IAW the requirements of 40 C.F.R. 80.570. (T-0) 4.4.3.  DELETED. 4.4.4.  E.  O.  13514,  Federal  Leadership  in  Environmental,  Energy,  and  Economic Performance  (applicable  to  all  installations,  including  overseas).    Installations  should  take measures to reduce mobile source emissions as a means of achieving GHG goals established by  the  Air  Force  Strategic  Sustainability  Performance  Plan  (SSPP)  goals  under  EO  13514.  Such measures may include: reducing vehicle fleet petroleum use by 30% through fiscal year 2020, increasing the use of alternative fuels, reducing employee business travel, and reducing employee  commuting  by  teleworking.    For  vehicle  fleet  management  and  transportation, VEMSO  is  the  responsible  agency  to  measure,  report,  manage,  and  reduce  GHG  emissions toward agency defined targets. (T-2) AFI32-7040  4 NOVEMBER 2014 25 Chapter 5 CHECKING AND CORRECTIVE ACTION 5.1.  General  Program  Guidelines  (applicable  to  all  installations,  including  overseas).  The effectiveness  of  the  Air  Quality  Program  is  measured  by  the  latest  metrics  established  by  the Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  (Installations  &  Environment)  and  presented  by  HQ USAF/A4C. 5.2.  Environment  Compliance  Assessment  and  Management  Program  (ECAMP).  Use the ECAMP  as  a  tool  for  assessing  and  monitoring  Air  Force  compliance,  and  identifying  and prioritizing  recommended  corrective  actions  as  necessary.  Installations  are  required  to  conduct compliance and EMS conformance assessments, and track preventative/corrective actions, IAW AFI 90-201, AFI 32-7001, and using additional AFCEC/CZ guidance and tools. 5.3.  Data Management.  The Air Force-approved information system for air quality is APIMS, which provides a standardized, integrated tool and methodology to track, manage, and report all data  related  to  the  Air  Quality  Program.    The  CEIE,  will  ensure  that  the  following  air  quality compliance  and  resource  management  data  are  accurately  maintained  in  APIMS  in  a  timely manner: AEIs, PTEs, operating permits, permit compliance assessments, refrigerant compliance, and employee-vehicle I/M Program self-certification. (T-1) 5.4.  Payment of Fines  and Penalties  (applicable only  to installations under the regulatory oversight of the EPA).  Except for in a handful of jurisdictions where payment of state or local punitive  CAA  penalties  is  required  as  a  matter  of  law,  the  authority  to  pay  such  penalties involves a policy decision that has not been delegated below the SAF/IEE level.  The installation SJA, after coordinating with  MAJCOM (or ANG and AFRC in  the case of Guard and Reserve installations) and appropriate Regional Counsel, and gaining authority from AFLOA/JACE and SAF/IEE as applicable, will authorize installation personnel to commence any negotiations with state or local regulators concerning a CAA enforcement action or other CAA compliance matter. (T-1).  The  installation  SJA  will  remain  informed  or  involved  in  all  significant  aspects  of  the negotiations and continue to  coordinate with  MAJCOM and appropriate Regional Counsel.  (T-1).    AFI  32-7047,  Environmental  Compliance,  Release,  and  Inspections  Reporting,  provides additional guidance on the settlement of EAs or local cases, and/or payment of fines or penalties. 5.5.  Training  and  Education.  Based  on  Air  Force-wide  tracking  and  trend  analysis, AFCEC/CZ  shall  pursue  effective,  but  economical,  air  quality  compliance  and  resource management education and training opportunities to include non-traditional classroom education and  alternative  training  methodologies  (e.g.,  correspondence  and  webinar  training).  (T-1).  At  a minimum,  AFCEC/CZ  will  include  the  following  specific  critical  air  quality  topics  to  be developed and maintained: 5.5.1.  AEI  and  PTE  training,  to  include  the  use  of  APIMS  and  estimating  procedures  for mobile,  stationary,  and  all  other  sources  of  air  emissions.  (T-1).  Training  addresses  typical mandatory  state  or  local  requirements  promulgated  per  40  CFR  Part  51,  Subpart  A,  Air Emissions Reporting Requirements. 5.5.2.  Air  Quality  EIAP  training,  to  include  EIAP,  NEPA  and  Conformity  Rules.  (T-1).  Training  addresses  mandatory  requirements  under  32  CFR  Part  989;  40  CFR  Parts  1500-1508; 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart W; and 40 CFR Part 93, Subparts A & B. 26 AFI32-7040  4 NOVEMBER 2014 5.5.3.  GHG  Mandatory  Reporting  training,  which  addresses  mandatory  requirements  under 40 CFR Part 98. (T-1) 5.5.4.  Any other air quality topic as needed to ensure compliance with all federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. (T-1) 5.6.  Base Attainment Status (applicable only to installations under the regulatory oversight of  the  EPA).  An  authoritative  attainment  status  list  is  kept  updated  to  correct  erroneous attainment  status  listings  in  the  EPA’s  “Green  Book”  which  is  not  regularly  maintained  or updated. 5.6.1.  AFCEC/CZ  shall  maintain  an  authoritative  attainment  status  list  for  Air  Force installations and facilities through on-going review of the U.S. CFRs. (T-1) 5.6.2.  The  CEIE  will  use  the  authoritative  list  for  permitting,  EIAP,  and  Conformity  Rules assessment. (T-1) 5.7.  Compliance Tracking. 5.7.1.  AFCEC/CZ,  IAW  AFI  32-7001,  will  assist  in  the  collection,  quality  assurance,  and analysis  of  data  by  tracking,  assessing,  and  communicating  new  or  emerging  regulatory requirements for potential impact on installation operations. (T-1) 5.7.2.  The  CEIE  shall  ensure  the  collection,  maintenance,  and  reporting  of  base-level  air quality data needed for the established key performance indicator, performance metrics, and DEPARC data reporting requirements. (T-1) AFI32-7040  4 NOVEMBER 2014 27 Chapter 6 MANAGEMENT REVIEW 6.1.  Regulatory  Agency  Noncompliance  Actions.  AFCEC/CZ  and  the  CEIE  will  review management  action  plans  that  ensure  outstanding  OEAs  are  resolved  within  the  required  time frames.  (T-1).  Additionally,  AFCEC/CZ,  working  with  the  base  environmental  function,  will review the response to regulatory agency inspection findings to ensure timely corrective actions and reporting timelines. (T-1) 6.2.  Automated  Civil  Engineer  System  -  Program  Management  (ACES-PM).  Installations and  AFCEC/CZ  will  use  the  ACES-PM  (or  subsequent  approved  Air  Force  system)  to  plan, program, and budget requirements for air quality compliance and resource management. (T-1)  It is the Air Force’s preference to pursue/program a feasible pollution prevention solution in order to meet a compliance requirement (ref: AFI 32-7001, Chapter 6). 6.3.  Environment,  Safety  and  Occupational  Health  Councils  (applicable  to  AFCEC/CZ and  all  installations,  including  overseas).  Installation Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health  Councils  (ESOHCs)  are  the  appropriate  forum  for  coordinating  Air  Quality  Program corrective actions that require cross-functional review, deliberation, and approval.  ESOHCs also conduct  management  reviews  IAW  AFI  32-7001  to  ensure  environmental  goals  and  permit conditions  are  being  met,  to  include  air  planning  goals,  air  permits,  emission  source recordkeeping procedures and compliance self-assessment  findings..  The ESOHC also  ensures program  goals  are  appropriate  and  produce  actions  to  fully  support  current  and  future  mission requirements with adequate air assets.  See AFI 90-801, Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health Councils, for further information. 28 AFI32-7040  4 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 7 RECORDS MANAGEMENT 7.1.  Records  Management.  APIMS,  the  Air  Force-approved  information  system  for  Air Quality  compliance, provides a standardized  and integrated tool and methodology  for tracking, records-keeping, managing, and reporting air quality data.  The CEIE will ensure the following: 7.1.1.  Air  quality  compliance  and  resource  management  data  are  accurately  maintained  in APIMS in a timely manner, including data related to the installation AEIs, PTEs, operating permits,  results  of  permit-driven  compliance  assessments,  refrigerant  compliance  records, and  other  pertinent  air  resource  management  information,  to  ensure  full  mission  support through effective management of natural infrastructure assets. (T-1) 7.1.2.  The  ECARS  automated  system  is  used  to  document  compliance  with  vehicle  I/M requirements  under  §118  of  the  CAA.  (T-1).  ECARS  is  a  module  of  the  APIMS  (as described  in  paragraph  4.4.1.3).  The  ECARS  system  sends  email  certification  instructions and  reminders  to  employees,  collects  the  minimum  personal  information  required  to document  employee  compliance  on  Air  Force  Form  4434  IAW  the  Privacy  Act  Statement (notice issued by EPA on 1 Oct 2001 at 66 Fed. Reg. 49955), prepares automated reports on employee  compliance,  and  archives  the  digitally  signed  employee  certification  forms  on  a secure server. 7.1.3.  All  General  Conformity  Applicability  Analysis  (as  described  in  paragraph  3.4.2)  is performed  using  the  ACAM  (or  other  Air  Force  approved  automated  air  quality  impact assessment  tool)  and  the  resulting  reports  and  data  files  are  maintained  in  the  approved environmental information system.

Conformity Applicability Analysis (as described in paragraph 2.4.2) for all federal actions in an air quality nonattainment or maintenance area with the potential for impact (positive or negative). Air  Pollutant—Any air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including any physical, chemical,  biological,  radioactive  (including  source  material,  special  nuclear  material  and byproduct material) substances or matter which emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air. Such  term  includes  any  precursors  to  the  formation  of  any  air  pollutant,  to  the  extent  the Administrator has identified such precursor or precursors for the particular purpose for which the term “air pollutant” is used. Air Program Information Management System (APIMS)—The Air Force information system for  air  quality  permit  management,  air  emissions  inventory,  vehicle  inspection  &  maintenance certification, and air emission reporting. 36 AFI32-7040  4 NOVEMBER 2014 Air Program Information Management System (APIMS)—The Air Force information system for  air  quality  permit  management,  air  emission  inventory,  vehicle  inspection  &  maintenance certification, and air emission reporting. Air  Quality  Standards—As  prescribed  by  regulations,  the  level  of  pollutants  that  may  not  be exceeded during a specific time in a defined area. Attainment Area—An area considered to have air quality as good as or better than the NAAQS as defined in the CAA.  An area may be an attainment area for one pollutant and a nonattainment area for others. Civil  Engineering-Installation  Management  Flight,  Environmental  Element  (CEIE)—For the  purpose  of  this  AFI,  this  refers  to  the  Environmental  function  embedded  in  Base  Civil Engineering.  This used to be under the Asset Management Flight, but AF Civil Engineering is transitioning  to  new  name.    Note:    At  some  installations,  Asset  Management  flight  under  CE might still remain with the Environmental function under it. Conformity—Conformity  is  the multi-step process  used to  determine and document whether  a proposed federal action meets the requirements of the General Conformity rule.  There are two main  components  to  the  overall  process:  an  applicability  analysis  to  determine  whether  a conformity  determination  is  required  and,  if  it  is,  a  Conformity  determination  to  determine whether the action conforms to the SIP. Criteria Pollutant—Air pollutants for which NAAQS have been established. Criteria pollutants include  nitrogen  dioxide  (NO2),  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2),  carbon  monoxide  (CO),  ozone  (O3), particulate matter (PM-10 & PM2.5) and lead (Pb). Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP)—The environmental impact analysis process provides procedures for environmental impact analysis both within the United States and abroad. EIAP  deals  primarily  with  environmental  impact  analysis  under  the  authority  of  the  National Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969  (NEPA).  The  EIAP  procedures  are  essential  to  achieve  and maintain compliance with NEPA and the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the NEPA. To comply with NEPA and complete the EIAP, the CEQ Regulations and the EIAP Regulations are used together.

To comply with NEPA and complete the EIAP, the CEQ Regulations and the EIAP Regulations must be used together. Enforcement Actions, Spills, and Inspections (EASI)—An Air Force-wide data collection and reporting system that houses the reporting modules for EAs, Spills (SIRIS), and Inspections. Emission—An emission is any release into the atmosphere of an air pollutant as defined in the CAA Amendments of 1990 Section 302 (g). Emissions can be released from boilers, generators, motor  vehicles  and  air  fleet,  degreasing  operations,  woodworking  and  welding,  depainting  and surface coating operations, etc. AFI32-7040  4 NOVEMBER 2014 37 Emissions  Inventory—A  detailed  listing,  by  source  and  type,  of  the  quantity  of  air  pollutants emitted into the atmosphere. Emission  Reduction  Credit  (ERC)—Emission  reduction  credits  are  a  novel  form  of  property for emissions trading purposes.  ERCs only exist when created IAW a system to establish, bank, and  trade  the  ERCs  under  a  state  or  local  (including  MPO  or  other  regional)  implementation plan. Employee-Vehicle  Certification  and  Reporting  System  (ECARS)—An  automated  system,  a module  of  the  APIMS,  used  by  §  118  of  the  CAA  affected  facilities  to  document  compliance with requirements under § 118 of the CAA. Enforcement  Action—Actions  taken  by  regulators  to  obtain  compliance  with  environmental laws, rules, regulations, or agreements and/or obtain penalties for violations. Government-owned,  contractor  operated  (GOCO)—A  facility  that  is  owned  by  the Government and operated under contract by a non-government, private firm. Hazardous Air Pollutants—Those substances listed by EPA or states that have been identified as serious threats to human health or the environment. Installation  Commander—The  host  unit  commander  who  discharges  the  duties  directed  by United States statutes or Air Force directives. Key  Source  Categories—  The  Air  Force-wide  top  emitting  source  categories,  which  includes RICE and boilers/process heaters. Maintenance  Area—Any  geographic  region  of  the  United  States  designated  as  attainment subject  to  the  requirement  to  develop  a  maintenance  plan  under  Section  175A  of  the  CAA,  as amended. Major  Stationary  Source  &  Major  Emitting  Facility—Except  as  otherwise  expressly provided, both terms mean sources that emit 100 tons per year or more of any air pollutant. The exceptions are: -1) 250 tons per year of any regulated pollutant from any source in an attainment area other than one of the twenty-eight listed sources in 42 U.S.C. Section 7479;   -2) 50 tons per year/ 25 tons per year/ 10 tons per year of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) or NOx in serious, severe, and extreme O3 nonattainment areas, respectively;   Mobile Source—Any non-stationary source of air pollution, such as cars, trucks, buses, planes, trains, motorcycles, and gasoline-powered lawn mowers. Mobile sources are typically classified as  being  either  “on-road”  or  “non-road”  in  nature.  Examples  of  on-road  sources  include  cars, trucks, and buses; while examples of non-road sources include construction equipment, aircraft, aircraft  ground  support  equipment,  and  other  tactical  equipment  used  in  combat  or  combat support operations. Monitoring—Periodic or continuous surveillance or testing to determine the level of compliance with statutory requirements and/or pollutant levels in various media or in humans, animals, and other living things. National  Ambient  Air  Quality  Standards  (NAAQS)—Standards  established  by  the  EPA  for six  criteria  air  pollutants  that  are  commonly  found  in  ambient  air  throughout  the  country.  Two types  of  NAAQS  have  been  established.  Primary  standards  set  limits  to  protect  public  health, 38 AFI32-7040  4 NOVEMBER 2014 while  secondary  standards  set  limits  to  protect  public  welfare.  Areas  with  good  air  quality  are referred  to  as  being  in  “attainment”  with  the  NAAQS,  while  areas  with  poor  air  quality  are referred to as being “nonattainment” with the NAAQS. New  Source—Any  stationary  source  that  is  built  or  modified  after  publication  of  final  or proposed regulations  that  prescribe a standard of performance intended to apply to  that type of emission source. New  Source  Performance  Standards  (NSPS)—Uniform  national  air  emission  standards established by EPA that limit the amount of pollution allowed from new or existing sources that have been modified. NSPS are found in 40 C.F.R. Part 60. Nonattainment  Area—Geographic  area  with  measured  air  quality  that  does  not  meet  one  or more of the NAAQS for the criteria pollutants designated through the CAA. Personal  Property—Any  property  including  military  equipment,  but  excluding  real  property, consumable  items,  component  parts  of  a  higher  assembly,  or  items  that  lose  their  individual identity through use. Potential  to  Emit  (PTE)—The  maximum  capacity  of  a  stationary  source  to  emit  any  air pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity  of  a  source  to  emit  an  air  pollutant,  including  air  pollution  control  equipment  and restrictions  on  hours  of  operation  or  on  the  type  or  amount  of  material  combusted,  stored,  or processed, is treated as part of its design if the limitation is enforceable by the EPA. Potential  to  Emit  (PTE)—The  maximum  capacity  of  a  stationary  source  to  emit  any  air pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity  of  a  source  to  emit  an  air  pollutant,  including  air  pollution  control  equipment  and restrictions  on  hours  of  operation  or  on  the  type  or  amount  of  material  combusted,  stored,  or processed, shall be treated as part of its design if the limitation is enforceable by the EPA. Precursors  of  a  Criteria  Pollutant—Precursors  are  those  pollutants  that  contribute  to  the formation of a criteria pollutant. For O3, precursors are NOx (unless an area is exempted from NOx  requirements  under  the  CAA,  Section  182(f)),  and  VOCs;  and  for  PM10,  precursors  are those pollutants described in the applicable nonattainment area SIP as significant contributors to PM10 levels. For PM2.5, the scientifically recognized precursors are ammonia, SO2, NOx, and VOCs  per  EPA’s  proposed  implementation  rule  at  70  Federal  Register  65983  (November  1, 2005). As of this writing it is uncertain which, if any, of these is actually regulated as precursors for purposes of NSR, General Conformity, or other SIP rules.

As  of  this  writing  it  is  uncertain  which,  if  any,  of  these  will  actually  be  regulated  as precursors for purposes of NSR, General Conformity, or other SIP rules. AFI32-7040  4 NOVEMBER 2014 39 Prevention  of  Significant  Deterioration  (PSD)—The  EPA  program  in  which  federal  and/or state permits restrict emissions for new or modified sources in places where air quality is already better than required to meet the NAAQS. Responsible  Official—The  installation  commander  for  purposes  of  signing  Title  V  Operating Permit  applications,  amendments,  supplements,  or  corrections  and  for  certifying  Title  V Operating  Permit  deviation  reports,  monitoring  reports,  compliance  certifications,  or  any  other document that requires certification by a “Responsible Official” under the applicable regulations. The  responsibility  to  certify  the  federal  agency  Responsible  Official  may  not  be  delegated. Section 70.2 of the Title V Operating Permit regulations (40 CFR Part 70) defines a Responsible Official as follows: “For a municipality, State, Federal, or other public agency: either a principal executive officer or ranking elected official. For the purposes of this part, a principal executive of  a  Federal  agency  includes  the  chief  executive  officer  having  responsibility  for  the  overall operations of a principal geographic unit of the agency (e.g., a Regional Administrator of EPA).” Risk  Management—The  process  of  evaluating  alternative  regulatory  and  non-regulatory responses  to  risk  and  selecting  among  them.  The  selection  process  requires  consideration  of impact to human health and the environment, legal, economic, military and social factors. Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)—A  plan  that  documents  the  actions  a  facility  that  stores, transports or uses regulated hazardous substances at levels exceeding established thresholds will take to prevent and mitigate their accidental release, and reduce the severity of releases that do occur. RMP requirements are found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68. Sovereign  Immunity—The  legal  principal  that  the  federal  government  cannot  be  subjected  to state  penalties  or  judgments  of  state  courts  except  where  Congress  has  expressly  waived  such immunity in the CAA or other statute. State Implementation Plans (SIPs)—SIPs are state plans for the establishment, regulation, and enforcement of air pollution standards. SIPs approved by the EPA are federally enforceable. Stationary Source—A fixed, non-moving producer of pollution, such as power plants and other facilities  using  industrial  combustion  processes,  paint  spray  booths,  fuel  storage  tanks,  and solvent cleaning facilities. Synthetic Minor—A facility or stationary source that has voluntarily limited its PTE by means of a federally enforceable order, rule, or permit condition to ensure its emissions do not exceed major source thresholds. Volatile  Organic  Compounds  (VOCs)—Any  organic  compound in atmospheric photochemical  reactions, except  for  those designated by EPA as having negligible photochemical reactivity. that  participates  40 AFI32-7040  4 NOVEMBER 2014 Attachment 2 AIR EMISSION REDUCTION CREDITS A2.1.  Air  Emission  Reduction  Credits.  The  CAA  allows  the  EPA  and  the  states  to  develop economic incentive programs to control and reduce air emissions. Such programs allow sources to  “generate”,  “buy”,  “sell”,  “bank”,  or  “trade”  emissions  reduction  credits  (ERCs).    ERCs  are authorized  and  created  by  appropriate  state  or  local  authorities,  and  will  vary  from  location  to location  pursuant  to  applicable  EPA  rules.    ERC  programs  need  to  be  approved  by  EPA  in  a State  Implementation  Plan  (SIP)  to  become  effective.  Credits  earned  by  any  source  that permanently  reduces  emissions  beyond  its  reduction  requirements  can  be  traded  to  another source that could use such credits, in lieu of on-site reductions, to meet its reduction obligations.  ERCs  may  also  be  banked  for  future  use  as  offsets  for  nonattainment  area  NSR  or  General Conformity  determinations.    ERCs  are  treated  as  federal  personal  property  and  disposed  of according to the appropriate federal property disposal regulations.  Flying operations shall not be reduced  for  the  sole  purpose  of  obtaining  ERCs;  however,  installations  should  ensure  that emissions  from  aircraft  flying  operations  are  accounted  for  in  comprehensive  emissions inventories and memorialized in any applicable SIP emissions budget for the installation. A2.2.  Emission  Reduction  Credit  Identification.  ERCs  can  be  created  as  a  result  of operational changes or installation closure. They can be obtained by removing pollutant-emitting equipment  from  service  or  reducing  emissions  from  equipment,  if  the  applicable  air  quality district  allows.    Planning  for  ERC  utilization  should  include  a  determination  of  the  applicable requirements for generation as soon as possible to avoid inadvertent loss of ERCs due to missed requirements.    For  example,  some  local  rules  require  submission  of  an  application  for  ERCs along with supporting documentation prior to any shutdown of the emissions source while other local  rules  require  submission  of  the  application  within  90  days  of  permanent  shutdown.    In addition, some states may have laws that expressly apply to various aspects of ERC generation and  disposition  involving  military  base  closures  and  realignments,  such  as  the  Cannella  Bill  in California, AB 3204 (1994), codified at Health and Safety Code Section 40709.7. A2.3.  Emission Reduction Credit Inventory and Classification.  Within one year, or as early as possible, prior to the departure of the active mission from a currently announced installation closure  or  realignment  (immediately  at  installations  where  the  active  mission  has  departed  or equipment emitting air emissions are discontinued, or within six months of an installation closure announcement for future closures), the base environmental  function will complete an inventory of  all  existing/potential  sources  of  ERCs  and  associated  emissions,  and  have  a  legal  review prepared  summarizing  the  applicable  air  quality  district  regulations  on  ERCs.    Copies  of  the applicable ERC regulation will be included when facility ERCs are identified and any limitations on the disposition of the ERCs will be noted in the legal review.  Such limitations may include prohibitions  on  the  use  of  ERCs  at  closing  facilities  and  if  there  are  any  restrictions  on  the leasing of ERCs.  Forward the inventory, legal review, and appropriate regulations governing the use of these ERCs to the appropriate AFCEC Regulatory/Legislative Support Branch.  The ERCs will be initially classified as “related personal  property  ERCs”, “operational  needs  requirement ERCs”, or “personal property ERCs” on the inventory.  AFCEC/CZ will circulate the inventory to other MAJCOMs and installations in the same air quality district that will identify ERCs they might  need.    AFCEC/CZ  will  then  validate  the  list  and  forward  it  with  comments  back  to  the appropriate MAJCOM and AFCEC/CZ.  AFCEC/CZ, in concert with the appropriate MAJCOM, AFI32-7040  4 NOVEMBER 2014 41 will  review/validate  the  ERCs/categories,  coordinate  with  HQ  USAF/A4C,  and  submit  to SAF/IEE for final approval. A2.4.  Emission  Reduction  Credit  Application.  The  CAA  allows  sources  in  nonattainment areas with EPA-approved ERC programs to “trade” ERCs.  Installations must follow regulatory agency procedures to apply for and obtain ERCs if interested in obtaining ERCs and if they have adequate funds for the associated fees.  Installation realignment and closure funds may be used to conduct the emission reduction credit inventory and to pay for application fees for installations slated  for  closure.    MAJCOMs  must  submit  their  requirements  to  the  AFCEC  Installations Directorate  (AFCEC/CI)  IAW  AFCEC  programming  procedures.    MAJCOMs  receiving  ERCs from closure installations will reimburse the installation realignment and closure account for its proportionate  share  of  the  costs  of  the  inventory  and  application  fees.    Reimbursement  is  not required if the receiving installation is an installation realignment and closure site. A2.5.  Emission  Reduction  Credit  Disposition.  Once  an  air  quality  district  issues  ERCs,  and SAF/IEE has approved their use, ERCs can be disposed in the following manner. A2.5.1.  “Operational  needs  requirement  ERCs”  can  be  banked  for  the  requirements  of  the originating  installation  or  can  be  transferred  to  another  Air  Force  organization  that  would need to buy the credits. A2.5.2.  “Related personal property ERCs” will be disposed of in the same manner as the real property on the inventory to which they are “related.” A2.5.3.  “Personal  property  ERCs”  will  be  screened  with  other  DoD  and  other  federal agencies. Thereafter, the installation will transfer any remaining ERCs as surplus property to the General Services Administration (GSA) for disposal under GSA regulations. A2.5.4.  SAF/IEE will resolve any disputes over disposition of ERCs. A2.6.  Emission Reduction Credit Use.  ERCs can only be used in the same air quality control district/region  in  which  they  are  generated,  except  where  state  or  local  laws  and  regulations provide otherwise.  For example, the Discrete Emission Reduction Credit (DERC) regulations in Texas allow stationary and mobile DERCs generated within the state, with certain limitations, to be used anywhere within the state.  In addition, and under certain circumstances, DERCs created outside the state may also be used within the state.  In California, Section 40709.6 of the Health and  Safety  Code  permits  the  inter-basin  transfer  of  emission  offsets  or  ERCs  from  upwind  to downwind sources, even though they may be in different air quality control areas.
