This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) provides information necessary for the Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, trainers, and the applicable Air Education and Training Command (AETC) training wing to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field education and training program. This plan outlines training individuals must receive to develop and progress throughout their career. It also identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced proficiency, sustainment, and continuing education and training. Initial skills training is the Air Force Specialty (AFS) specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into a specialty. For our career field, this training is provided by AETC, 382d Training Squadron (TRS) at Ft Sam Houston, TX. Upon successful completion of the training, individuals are awarded their 3-skill level Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). 1.1.  Upgrade Training (UGT) identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3, 5 and 7-skill levels.  Qualification Training (QT) is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the UGT process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal AFS training used for selected airmen. Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence, exportable advanced training courses, or on-the- Job Training (OJT), provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP also serves the following purposes: 1.1.1.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career. 1.1.2.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method. 1.1.3.  Identifies major resource constraints which may impact full implementation of the career field training process. 1.1.4.  Identifies the training elements required for Readiness Skills Training (RST) to ensure individuals are fully trained to meet contingency missions. 2. Use.  MFMs and supervisors at all levels will use the plan to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty. 2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, non-resident, field, and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the  CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade qualification, and proficiency requirements.  OJT, resident training, contract  training, or exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements.  Any MAJCOM-developed training used to  support this AFSC must be included in this plan. 2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.  10             3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority for this CFETP.  MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on career field training requirements. The CFM for this specialty will initiate an annual review of this document by AETC and  MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training. Section B - Career Progression and Information 1.  Specialty Description 1.1.  Specialty Summary.

Skill/Career Progression. Timely training and progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level play an important role in the Air Force's ability to accomplish its mission. It is essential that everyone involved in training do their part to plan, manage and conduct an effective training program. The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure individuals receive viable training at appropriate points in their careers. Supervisors may use this area as a guide for general counseling sessions. The following narrative and Figures 5.1 and 5.3 identify career/skill progression. 2.1.  Apprentice (3) Level. Initial skills training in the medical materiel specialty consists of tasks and knowledge training provided in the 3-skill level in-resident course (L5ABJ4A131-00AA). All students in this specialty   will complete the Medical Materiel Apprentice course in-residence at Ft Sam Houston, TX and upon successful completion of the course students will be awarded the 3-skill level. The primary focus of the course is to provide the trainee a basic foundation of medical materiel practices, procedures and logistics based medical readiness. After completion of this course, and upon arrival at his or her first duty assignment, the apprentice will enter upgrade training through enrollment in the 4A151 Career Development Course (CDC) through AFCDA.  Apprentices should devote their time to learning and subsequently performing assigned duties in the specialty. Trainees can expect to be assigned to entry level materiel processes such as receiving, storage, distribution, forward customer support, document control, research, and inventory control. Trainees may be assigned to other sections of medical materiel not listed previously depending upon the need and size of the workcenter. Knowledge of these processes provides the basis for providing further growth in the medical materiel specialty. Although extenuating circumstances may prohibit it, trainees should be proactive and request training in areas of self-identified weaknesses. 2.2.  Journeyman (5-skill level). Journeymen are expected to build upon the skills learned as an apprentice by learning and performing, completion of the 4A151 CDC, and certification of core tasks identified in the STS. The CDC is a self-study correspondence course designed to provide airmen with the fundamental knowledge of the AFS. Five-skill level upgrade training includes additional OJT for the associated skill level. Within the medical materiel specialty, journeymen will move into more complex materiel processes such as customer service, systems administration, requisitioning, developing requirements, contingency medical materiel, equipment management, and etc. Once upgraded, journeymen enter into continuation training to broaden their experience base. Journeymen will attend Airman Leadership School (ALS) when they meet the eligibility requirements outlined in Air Force Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) and AFI 36-2301, Developmental Education.  ALS is accredited by the Community College of the Air Force (CCAF), which awards all graduates 10 semester hours of college credit.  After ALS, journeymen may be selected to perform duties as trainers and supervisors and be considered for appointment as unit AFS trainers.  To enhance their skills, journeymen are encouraged to continue their education toward a CCAF degree.  CDCs and other study references listed in the Enlisted Promotion Reference and Requirements Catalog are used to assist airmen in  their preparation for promotion testing. 2.3.  Craftsman (7-skill level).  Airmen must be Staff Sergeant (SSgt) selectees or above to enter craftsman upgrade training and must successfully complete the 4A171 Medical Materiel Craftsman CDC before upgrade to the 7-skill level.  Seven-skill level upgrade training will include certification in core tasks identified in the STS. Once 12      upgraded, a craftsman can expect to fill various supervisory and management positions such as NCOIC, supervisor, program manager, and task trainer. 2.3.1.  Craftsman will complete the Noncommissioned Officer Academy (NCOA) when they meet the eligibility requirements outlined in ETCA and AFI 36-2301.  The NCOA is accredited by the CCAF, which awards all graduates 12 semester hours of college credit.  As airmen progress through the ranks to Master Sergeant (MSgt) they should take every opportunity to complete each level of professional military education (PME) at the earliest date possible.  Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy (SNCOA) is accredited by the CCAF, which awards all graduates 9 semester hours of college undergraduate credit.  Eligible Technical Sergeants (TSgt) should enroll in the applicable PME to enhance their ability to manage personnel assigned under  them.  Continued academic education through CCAF and higher degree programs is strongly encouraged, especially by enrolling in courses on management of resources and personnel. 2.3.2.  Membership, certification or registration with a professional medical materiel organization is desirable. All medical materiel personnel are eligible to apply for certifications outlined in the Air Force COOL. For those with Veteran’s benefits, eligible members can obtain reimbursement. 2.3.3. The Medical Materiel Supervisor Course, as outlined in the Course Training Standard in Part II, Section A of this CFETP, is designed to provide a foundation for advanced medical materiel business practices and theories.  The Medical Materiel Supervisor course is a 16-day course designed to prepare non-commissioned officers (NCOs) for the increased level of responsibility as the non-commissioned officer in charge (NCOIC) or Superintendent of a Medical Logistics account. Topics covered include acquisition and inventory management, inventory quality management, medical equipment management, services contract management, management reports, financial management, training, and manpower. Emphasis is placed on utilizing the Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) computer system as a management tool. Attendees must possess a 7-skill level or waiver by the AFCFM. Multiple course attendances are authorized after any major course revisions. 2.4.  Superintendent (9) Level.  Before attaining the 9-skill level, individuals must hold the rank of Senior Master Sergeant (SMSgt), meet mandatory requirements listed in the AFECD, be recommended by their supervisor, and approved by the commander for the award of the 9-skill level.  A superintendent can expect to fill positions such as flight chief, superintendent, FM, and various staff positions.  Additional training in the areas of resources, leadership skills, and management should be pursued through continuing education.  Completion of higher degree programs is strongly encouraged.  Membership and certification with a  professional medical materiel organization is highly desirable. 2.5.  Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) 4A100.  CEM code is awarded upon promotion to Chief Master Sergeant (CMSgt).  CEMs routinely perform duties as the MFM for the career field, at various command levels, group or squadron superintendent, and flight chief.  Additional training in the areas of resources, leadership skills and management should continue.  Completion of higher degree programs is strongly encouraged.  Membership and certification with a professional medical materiel organization is desirable and strongly encouraged.       3.  Training Decisions.  This CFETP uses a building block approach to encompass the entire spectrum of  training requirements for the medical materiel specialty.  This spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and  how to meet these training requirements.  This strategy is used to develop affordable training, eliminate  duplication and prevent a fragmented approach to training.  The training strategy and plan outlined in this CFETP  was formed during the 4A1X1 Specialty Training Requirements Team (STRT) / Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) at Ft Sam Houston, TX, 24 - 28 October 2016 from information identified in Occupational Analysis (OA) and training requirements analysis conducted by the Occupational Analysis Division and 4A1X1 subject matter expert input. Changes to the CFETP were captured in the STRT minutes and reside with the AFCFM.  4.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).  CCAF is one of several federally chartered degree-granting institutions; however, it is the only 2-year institution exclusively serving military enlisted personnel. The college is regionally accredited through Air University by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges  13 and Schools (SACS) to award AAS degrees designed for specific Air Force occupational specialties and is the largest multi-campus community college in the world. Upon completion of basic military training and assignment to an AF career field, all enlisted personnel are registered in a CCAF degree program and are afforded the opportunity to obtain an Associate in Applied Science degree. In order to be awarded, degree requirements must be successfully completed before the student separates from the Air Force, retires, or is commissioned as an officer. See the CCAF website for details regarding the AAS degree programs at http://www.airuniversity.af.mil/Barnes/.  4.1.  CCAF Degree Requirements.

The following career pyramid (Figure 5.1.) pictorially reflects the recommended job and skill progression  pattern.  The training and functions are aligned with rank and experience levels normally expected of someone  in that period of his or her career.  For instance, special duty assignments are normally not part of an individual’s career until they reach the grade of SSgt. We realize there will be exceptions, but you should use  this as a guide to help determine training expectations and career planning. We strongly recommend unit functional managers, superintendents, and supervisors rotate 3- and 5-skill level personnel through all major career  tracks (displayed on the pyramid) to better prepare them for supervisory and management responsibilities of the  7- and 9-skill levels. Career pyramids are developed through myVector.

Course Objectives for Initial Skills Course.  To obtain a copy of a COL, contact: Training Development Element 382 TRS/TRR 3480 Garden Avenue Ft Sam Houston, TX 78234 Phone: DSN 420-5359 or Commercial: (210) 808-5359 1.1.  Each proficiency coded task or knowledge item taught at the technical school is measured using an objective.  An objective is a written instruction for the students, so they know what is expected of them to successfully complete training on each task or knowledge item.  Each objective is composed of a condition, behavior, and a standard.  The condition is the setting in which the training takes place (type of equipment or references when required).  The behavior is the observable portion of the objective (perform hand washing). The standard is the level of performance that is measured to ensure the proficiency code level is maintained (e.g., to a 70% or with no instructor assists).  All objectives use a progress check (PC), written test (W) or a (-) combination of both to measure a student’s ability (skill) or knowledge. 1.2.  Standard.  The minimum standard for written examinations is 70% (which can be waived).  Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist. Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. 1.3.  Proficiency Level.  Behavior statements are taught at the analysis, evaluation, and application levels. Prerequisites for course attendance support or augment training provided in the medical materiel supervisor’s course. 42     Section C - Support Materials 1.  Training Platforms (TPs).  There may be certain opportunities to be assigned to duties in a specific area that requires other than the normal medical materiel formal training and the following training platforms will assist in 4A1X1 progression. 1.2.  Comprehensive Medical Readiness (CMR) Program.  AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Program Management, is the  source for the program.  All required training elements for the CMR program can be found at the Air Force Medical Service Kx Knowledge Exchange website. 1.3.  Integrated Data Environment (IDE)/Global Transportation Network (GTN) Convergence (IGC) Website. This website is the first step for access to U.S. Transportation Command’s (USTRANSCOM) GTN. It gives its customers located anywhere in the world a seamless, near-real-time capability to access – and employ – transportation and deployment information. IGC is an automated command and control information system that supports the family of transportation users and providers, both Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial, by providing an integrated system of in-transit visibility information and command and control capabilities. IGC collects and integrates transportation information from selected transportation systems. The resulting information is provided to the National Command Authorities, Combatant Commanders, USTRANSCOM, its component commands and other DoD customers to support transportation planning and decision-making during peace and war. In keeping with modern technology, IGC is available for those who have requested and obtained a login/ password. It is vital for members deploying to register for access to IGC far in advance of their in order to assist their follow-up procedures. 1.4.  Electronic Catalog (ECAT).  The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) ECAT website provides a "Total Catalog/Total Delivered Price" program offering laboratory, dental, and optical products.  ECAT also supports special committed volume pricing, enabling individual customer’s access to tier pricing and deep unit price discounts based on volume or other considerations such as standardizing on one brand of products.  ECAT provides paperless contracting, electronic ordering, electronic invoicing, and electronic payments. 1.5.  Patient Movement Item (PMI).  The objective of the PMI program is to sustain patient movement through the aeromedical evacuation (AE) system without diminishing the capability of forward medical units.  The PMI program manages all PMI assets and provides sufficient assets to sustain AE operations or provide for in-kind exchange when PMI accompanies a patient in the AE system.  The Joint Readiness Clinical Advisory Board  has identified certain core PMI that are critical to patient care, must be certified for AE operations, and are to be managed under this program.  Medical materiel teams will manage PMI equipment, supplies, accountability and acquisition of required materiel, and facilitate equipment recycling, scanning, and tracking in the Patient Movement Items Tracking System (PMITS).  PMITS is a system of systems under DMLSS for non-theater sites and under Theater Medical Information Program-Joint for theater sites.  Use of PMITS is mandatory for PMI asset visibility and tracking.  It allows proactive support for deployed organizations.  PMITS training can be located through the Military Health System (MHS) learning website.  All PMI Center, AE and Critical Care Air Transport Team personnel are required to complete PMITS training and forward their training certificate to the designated program management office. 1.6.  Logistics Module (LOGMOD).  LOGMOD is a software application used by logistics planners at all Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard levels to conduct deployment deliberate planning and crisis action execution.  The system allows easier management of Standard Unit Type Code (UTC) Logistics Details. It assembles Contingency Plan equipment requirements, provides personnel readiness/immunizations tracking capability, assigns personnel to deployment taskings, and provides deployment scheduling and monitoring capabilities. 43        1.7.   Theater Lead Agent for Medical Materiel (TLAMM).  A TLAMM is an organization or unit designated to serve as a major theater medical distribution node and provide the face to the customer for MEDLOG and supply chain management.  It provides a support operations structure that has habitual relationships with medical customers, supporting MEDLOG organizations, transportation and distribution managers, and the supported JFS.  A TLAMM may be an existing organization that provides routine medical materiel support to theater medical operations, or an organization that is created as required for a specific OPLAN by deployment of the necessary MEDLOG capabilities.  It is normally operated by a Service component command as part of the integrated medical system.  A TLAMM may be a military organization or unit or, under some circumstances, a contractor operated activity.  The TLAMM supports all Service components and designated multinational and/or nongovernmental customers.  Joint Publication 4-02 outlines TLAMM roles and responsibilities. US Army Medical Materiel Centers (USAMMC) also typically perform TLAMM functions. 1.8.  Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Transaction Services. As part of the DLA network,  the Transaction Services website provides online tools for supply, distribution, and information reporting. Timely information critical to military preparedness and to materiel management is available with an approved login and password. Customers can use Transaction Services through an interactive network of gateways and databases. Transaction Services is linked to over one hundred DIS-similar databases, providing an interoperative capability to service thousands of customers world-wide without interruption. Specific tools include: the Web Visual Logistics Information Processing System (WEBVLIPS), which can track requisitions from their release into the DoD pipeline, until the materiel is posted to the accountable records at the destination activity; the Web Supply Discrepancy Reporting (WebSDR), which is a tool used to report shipping or packaging discrepancies attributable to the responsibility of the shipper, and to provide appropriate responses and resolution. 1.9.  Air Force Medical Logistics (AFML) Website.  The virtual foundation of Medical Logistics, the AFML website offers the full spectrum of information and guidance pertaining to all aspects of logistics management. Key  areas are focused on 1) Policy (AFIs, Getting Started in Medical Logistics, Business Plan, Policy Letters), 2) Resource Management (Air Force Working Capital Fund, Other Procurement Programs (OP), Real Property Maintenance, Central Contracts), 3) Readiness (Assembly Management, Anthrax Vaccine Program, Central Procurement, Expeditionary Medical Logistics), 4) Clinical Engineering (Facility Management, Clinical Equipment, Clinical Technology Assessment and Review, Medical Technology Integration and Support), 5) Business Analysis , (Production Plan, Requisition Priorities and Force Activity Designators, War Reserve Materiel Spend Plan), 6) Procurement, Stock Management (Shelf Life Extension Program, Excess/ Tri-Service Medical Excess Distribution System, Quality Assurance, Vaccine Programs, Supply Discrepancy Report), 7) Systems (MEDLOG, DMLSS, JMAR), and a full scale menu of Career Field Manager (Career Corner) informational items pertaining to education and training of the Air Force Specialty.  Additionally, career field personnel can be located through the Air Force Medical Logistics Bluebook (contact directory) as well as keeping abreast of current workshops afforded to Medical Logistics. 1.10.  DMLSS.  The Joint Medical Logistics Functional Development Center at Ft Detrick, MD, offers training related to the use of the DMLSS computer system.  Training topics are continually evolving and includes  training on DMLSS versions 2.X, 3.X, Instructional Design, and service specific training modules. Additionally,  the e-Learning center offers computer-based training on a variety of topics.  The DMLSS Training websites  are located on the AFML website. 44             1.11.  Safety Data Sheets (SDS).  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) is what Safety Data Sheets (SDS) were called before the US Federal agency, OSHA, implemented its version of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) under the 2012 revision of the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200 (commonly referred to as the HazCom Standard). In everyday terminology, the two terms are used interchangeably, however, strictly speaking, SDS's have a structured format and required information that MSDS's were not required to have. An SDS is designed to provide both workers and emergency personnel with the proper procedures for handling or working with a particular substance. SDS's include information such as physical data (melting point, boiling point, flash point etc.), toxicity, health effects, first aid, reactivity, storage, disposal, protective equipment, spill/leak procedures, and more. While SDS's are of particular use if a spill or other accident occurs, they are key to preventing workplace exposure and accidents and should always be consulted before working with a material or developing a new process. In the US and other countries that use the GHS system, SDS's use a standardized format as well as carefully defined risk phrases, safety phrases, and pictograms to convey their information.  SDSs can be obtained from  manufacturers, distributors etc. and are readily available online. 1.12.  Hazardous Materials Information System (HMIS). HMIS was developed to help employers comply with OSHA’s Hazard Communication regulations. The system utilizes colored bars, numbers and symbols to convey the hazards of chemicals used in the workplace. HMIS information is available as a subsection of the Department of Transportation Hazardous Materials Safety website. The HMIS portion of this site provides additional data on federal, state and local governmental agencies that are responsible for the safety of hazardous materials transportation. This site goes into specific information related to incidents, exemptions, interpretations, approval, compliance and registration.   1.13.  U.S. Bank Access Online.  Mandatory software application for all government-wide purchase card holders and approving officials to use to reconcile charges against authorized purchases.  Contact local Base Contracting Offices for training information.  This tool is available on the U.S. Bank website. 1.14.  Occupation Safety Health Administration (OSHA).  Safety is important in all aspects of Medical Materiel daily operations.  Air Force safety standards are parallel with OSHA, which provides a training tool on their website as a great resource for supervisors. 1.15.  International Health Specialist (IHS).  This AFMS Kx Knowledge Exchange website provides the latest information and tools on the IHS program.  The IHS program was developed by the Air Force Medical Service to         support the DoD's Joint Vision, which states that today's joint force must be prepared to operate with multinational forces, governmental and non-governmental agencies, as well as international organizations.  The IHS program helps identify those with language, cultural, and/or geopolitical skills, and provides a database of medics with capabilities tailor-made for specific missions.  It consists of officer/enlisted members who fulfill IHS duties on a full time basis and also those who have elected to be included in a database pool from which members are selected or to augment specific IHS missions.  IHS personnel are expected to be or to become proficient       in a second language and to become knowledgeable of the political, military, economic, medical and cultural aspects of the country/region associated with their second language.  In addition to becoming an expert in      their area of responsibility and establishing host nation relationships,  IHS personnel play a pivotal role in supporting medical planning operations and deployment execution.  IHS members are eligible to participate in online language-learning resources to assist in becoming more proficient in one of 20 languages offered.  An IHS Special Experience Identifier is awarded to those who have met necessary criteria. 45     Section D - Training Course Index 1.  Purpose.

To provide ARC Medical Materiel apprentices (non-prior service and re-trainees) with an opportunity to receive the additional training necessary to become proficient in duties identified in the STS as a core task.  This section applies to all 4A1X1 personnel assigned to AFR and ANG medical and aeromedical evacuation/staging squadrons (referred to, hereafter, as the unit). 2.  Qualification.  Training requirements: 2.1.  Qualification training days are available for ARC Medical Materiel apprentices to satisfactorily initiate and complete the core task training requirements identified in this STS. 2.2.  Upon completion of the Medical Materiel Apprentice Course, all medical materiel apprentices may be assigned to an active duty Medical Center for up to 90 days (minimum of 30-60 days) to acquire proficiency in performing the core tasks required to successfully achieve the 5-skill level according to Air Force upgrade training guidelines. 2.3.  For optimal results, this follow-on training should commence immediately following graduation from the Medical Materiel Apprentice Course. 2.3.1.  Advanced planning is required to ensure the apprentice receives QT immediately upon graduating from the Medical Materiel Apprentice Course.  With concurrence from ARC medical unit commander, the section supervisor, in conjunction with the senior air reserve\health technician, must contact the active duty Medical Center to arrange follow-on training for the newly assigned 4A131 trainee.  This process should also be coordinated with the Guard\Reserve liaison at Ft Sam Houston, TX.  The MTF may recommend the apprentice receive upgrade training at a qualified AF MTF if extenuating circumstances (i.e., lack of qualified available staff, committed to supporting contingency operations, etc.) fail to permit the apprentice from receiving the training at their site.  (A qualified MTF is defined as a facility that possesses the time, equipment, and expertise necessary to train the apprentice on all core tasks as outlined in this STS.)  Active duty personnel must ensure that an experienced supervisor is assigned to assist the apprentice in gaining the desired confidence and proficiency.  The training schedule must be finalized prior to the Medical Materiel Apprentice Course start date. 2.4.  The AFR/ANG liaison can be reached at DSN 473-2205.  For written correspondence the address is as follows: Air National Guard (or Air Force Reserve) Liaison 1550 Wurtsmith Ave, Suite 2, Bldg. 5725 Lackland AFB, TX 78236 2.5.  To ensure continuity between resident training and qualification training at the Medical Center, the apprentice will forward a copy of his or her technical school certificate, AF Form 1256, Certificate of Training (LRA), to his/her unit of assignment.  The individual’s unit of assignment will then initiate upgrade action using AF Form 2096, Classification/On-The-Job Training Action, to award the 3-skill level and enter the apprentice in the appropriate training status code. 2.6.  An ARC unit may submit a waiver to bypass the above core task training if proficiency/seasoning days are unavailable or funding constraints limit a unit’s ability to participate.  In the case where QT days are unavailable, the training may be waived until such time that days become available and the apprentice has an opportunity to train on the core tasks identified in this STS.  The waiver package must be sent to:  HQ AFR/ANG Medical Materiel FM and the 4A1X1 AFCFM at Ft Detrick will be notified.   48
