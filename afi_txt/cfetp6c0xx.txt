This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty. This CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.  1.1. The  CFETP  incorporates  Acquisition  Professional  Development  Program  (APDP) requirements as they apply to the appropriate contracting career path.   2.  The CFETP consists of two parts.   2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A, explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B, identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C, associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training, and other).   2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A, identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, Technical References (TRs) to support training; Section B, references the Contracting Apprentice course objectives list, available via the AF Portal. Supervisors  will  use  this  website  to  determine  if  airmen  satisfied  training  requirements; Section C, entitled, “Support Materials”, is reserved; Section D, references the Education and Training  Course  Announcements  (ETCA)  website  for  USAF  Formal  Schools  course descriptions  and  training  information;  Section  E,  entitled,  “MAJCOM  Requirements”,  is  3  reserved. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.   2.3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.  3.  All contracting personnel should know and understand the CFETP.   3.1. Supervisors will utilize the Air Force Training Record (AFTR) system to maintain a CFETP for each enlisted member (except fully qualified Senior NCOs).   4  ABBREVIATIONS AND TERMS EXPLAINED  Acquisition Professional Development Program (APDP).

Additional  off-duty  education  is  a  personal  choice  that  is encouraged  for  all.  Individuals  desiring  to  become  an  Air  Education  and  Training Command  instructor  should  actively  pursue  an  Associate  of  Applied  Science  from  the CCAF.  A  degreed  faculty  is  necessary  to  maintain  CCAF  accreditation  through  the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.  7. Acquisition Professional Development Program (APDP)/DoD Career Development Program.   7.1.  With  implementation  of  the  Defense  Acquisition  Workforce  Improvement  Act  (P.L. 101-510), the Department of Defense established a Career Development Program for acquisition personnel. The Air Force implementing program is the APDP.  16   7.2.  APDP  Application.  APDP  applies  to  officer,  enlisted,  and  civilian  personnel occupying  acquisition-coded  contracting  positions.  It  provides  guidance  relating  to certification requirements applicable to the 6C0X1 career specialty.  7.3.  Certification  Requirements.  The  contracting  career  path  includes  three  progressive levels of certification. Each level identifies the completion of specific training, education and experience requirements.   *7.4. Certification/Skill Level/Grade Association. Air Force contracting has determined that positions on unit manning documents should be coded to require levels of certification commensurate with the required grade of the position. APDP certification is designed to be a balanced and progressive program of training, experience, and education. It is not intended  for  quick  attainment  without  having  practical  on-the-job  experiences  to accompany the certification. Personnel will only receive priority and approval to complete APDP certification based on their assigned duty position.  SAF/AQC (AFCFM) has final approval authority for enlisted members to attend any training course. See the table below for established position certification levels by grade:   GRADE Airman Basic Airman Airman First Class Senior Airman* Staff Sergeant Technical Sergeant Master/Senior Master  Sergeant** Senior/Chief Master Sergeant POSITION CERTIFICATION LEVEL None None Level I Level I* Level II Level II Level II/III** Level III SEI NA NA 129 129 130 130 130/131 131  NOTE: * Senior Airmen may enroll in APDP Level II courses and be certified if one of the following conditions has been met: a) a six-year enlistee who has served four years; b) an Airmen with a line number to Staff Sergeant; or c) a four-year enlistee who has re-enlisted.   *NOTE: **  Master Sergeants may enroll in APDP Level III courses and be certified when the following conditions are met: a) wearing the Master Contracting Badge; b) obtained a Bachelor's degree (any discipline, verifiable in your records); c) vectored (n/a for ANG and AFR); d) obtain Commander’s concurrence; e) assigned to a leadership position in your organization (see AFI 36-2618 for SNCO leadership duty titles); and f) members must have at least 24 months of retainability (n/a for ANG and AFR).    17  *7.5. Satisfying APDP Educational Requirements. A minimum of 24 semester hours in business-related disciplines of study from an accredited institution of higher education is required.  Some  examples  of  business  related  disciplines  are:  organization  and management,  accounting,  business  finance,  law,  contracts,  purchasing,  economics, industrial  management,  marketing,  and  quantitative  methods.  Enlisted  personnel  are strongly encouraged to use CCAF course work to receive business-hour credits to satisfy APDP  requirements.  Defense  Acquisition  University  (DAU)  contracting  courses  also result in business-hour credits through the CCAF. The following may be applied to the 24 semester hours in business: a) 8 semester hours when the 5-skill level is awarded; b) 2 semester hours for each  resident PME (Airman Leadership School, NCO Academy or USAF  Senior  NCO  Academy)  completed;  and  c)  14  semester  hours  earned  for  the Contracting Apprentice course (identified in member's CCAF transcript).  7.5.1.  Courses  Completed  Through  Civilian  Institutions.  Attending  civilian  courses through the Tuition Assistance Program is highly encouraged.   *7.5.2. Continuous Learning (CL). Every acquisition workforce member has a goal to earn 40 CL points each year and is required to earn 80 CL points every 2 years. For details regarding  Continuous  Learning,  reference  the  Guidelines  for  Crediting  Continuous Learning Activities located on the Air Force Portal.    8. Unique Aspects of Contracting Career Field.   8.1. The contracting career field is dynamic and demanding. It requires a high level of training, education, and experience. Besides Air Force technical and OJT requirements, federal  law  mandates  professional  certification  (detailed  in  Section  B,  Paragraph  7, Acquisition  Professional  Development  Program  (APDP)/DoD  Career  Development Program, of this plan). The following narrative is supported by AFSC 6C0X1 career field documents including the Contracting Career Path Pyramid (Figure 1.1) and related figures.   8.2. Job Rotation. Exposure to different positions and aspects of contracting is essential at all skill levels. Contract specialists need to gain experience in all aspects of operational contracting. To obtain requisite experience in a variety of contracting actions, or to allow for the rotation of those who need specific experiences, all specialists must rotate regularly to different positions within a contracting office.  8.2.1.  Training  and  Education.  Requirements  for  progression  in  Air  Force  skill  levels, APDP Contracting Levels, and OJT core task training often overlap. Contracting specialists need to attend Contracting Apprentice Course training courses, DOD courses in support of APDP certifications in Contracting, and accredited college courses.   8.2.2. Timelines for Training. Timelines provide a composite of technical, professional, and military  training  goals. They  combine technical training, OJT, APDP certification, PME,  and  other  education  and  training  goals.  Timelines  provide  guidance  in  skill  and career progression for Non-Prior Service and Prior Service (Retrainees). Unless stated as a maximum  time,  all  timelines  are  approximate.  Supervisors  will  make  adjustments  to accommodate the mission. Refer to Figure 1.2-1.3.   18   8.3  PME. Contracting Airmen attend PME commensurate with grade.  8.4. Journeyman (5-skill level).   *8.4.1.  For the award of AFSC 6C051, upgrade training consists of; a) completion of 5-skill  level  contracting  Career  Development  Courses  (CDC)  within  twelve  months,  b) minimum 12 months up-grade training (nine months for retrainees who held a 5-level in previous AFSC), c) completion of 5 level core tasks, d) meet mandatory requirements listed in  Air  Force  Enlisted  Classification  Directory  (AFECD)  and  this  CFETP,  e)  be recommended by supervisor, and f) be approved by the commander.  8.4.2.

Superintendent (9-skill level). Begin upgrade training to the 9-skill level upon selection to SMSgt. For award of AFSC 6C091, upgrade training consists of meeting the mandatory requirements listed in AFECD, supervisor’s recommendation and commander’s approval.  8.7.  Chief  Enlisted  Manager  (CEM/6C000).  A  CEM  is  a  CMSgt.  CEM  duties  and responsibilities vary depending on the assignment. Although their training and education requirements  are  the  same  as  those  of  Superintendents,  job-specific  requirements  vary according to assignment. The CEM code is earned upon promotion to CMSgt.  9. Special Experience Identifiers (SEIs).   19    9.1. Purpose. SEIs identify special experience and training not otherwise identified within the personnel data system (PDS). They are used when identifying experience or training is critical to the job and person assignment match and no other identification is appropriate or  available.  SEIs  are  tied  to  the  assignment  process  and  better  distribute  personnel  to optimize the job and person match.  *9.2.  Contracting  SEIs.  SEIs  reflect  training  and  experience  accomplishments  and certification  levels  for  the  APDP.  For  grade  requirements  and  their  corresponding  SEI requirement..  9.2.1. SEI Code 129. Represents APDP Contracting Level I certification. Enlisted positions in  the  contracting  career  field  associated  with  duties  above  the  simplified  acquisition threshold, are coded either 129 or 130.  9.2.2.  SEI  Code  130.  Represents  APDP  Contracting  Level  II  certification.  Enlisted positions  in  the  contracting  career  field  associated  with  duties  above  the  simplified acquisition threshold, are coded either 129 or 130.  9.2.3. SEI Code 131. Represents APDP Contracting Level III certification. 9.2.4 SEI Code 151.  Represents member is a warranted contracting officer. *9.3.  Responsibilities.  Because  SEIs  determine  assignment  of  positions  and  locations, personnel should work toward acquiring them.   9.3.1. Individuals. Responsible for ensuring the appropriate SEI Code is entered into their records.  They  do  so  either  at  their  Commander  Support  Staff  (CSS)  or  local  Military Personnel Section (MPS).  10.

Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by Air Education and Training Command. The schoolhouse implemented this training 7 Jan 2015 (with class 15005).  2. Purpose. As prescribed, this STS:  2.1. Lists in the column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge, and Technical References (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties  29  in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level. Numbers are sequenced numerically (i.e., 1.1, 1.2, and 2.1) Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies, by asterisk (*), specialty-wide training requirements.   2.2. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge  training  requirements.  Use  automated  training  management  systems  to document  technician  qualifications,  if  available.  Task  certification  must  show  a certification or completed date. (As a minimum, use the following column designators: Training Complete, Certifier Initials).   2.3. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training provided by the courses.  2.4.  Qualitative  Requirements.  “Attachment  1,  Qualitative  Requirements”  contains  the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and CDCs.   2.5. Use to document task when placed in AF Form 623, On-The-Job Training Record, and according to Chapter 6 of AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.  2.6. Promotion Testing. Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the AETC Airman Advancement Division, by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog. Individual responsibilities are in  Chapter  1  of  AFI  36-2605,  AF  Military  Personnel  Testing  System.  WAPS  is  not applicable to the ANG or AFR.  2.6.1. Documentation. Document completion of training. The AFCFM has determined that third party task certification is not required. Identify duty position requirements by circling the appropriate subparagraph number in Column 1. As a minimum, complete the following columns in Part I of the CFETP: Training Completed, Trainee Initials, and Trainer Initials. An AFJQS may be used in lieu of Part II of the CFETP only upon approval of the Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM). NOTE: The AFCFM may supplement these minimum documentation procedures as needed or deemed necessary for their Career Field.  2.6.1.1. CFETP Transcribing Procedures. Use the new CFETP to identify and document all past and current qualifications. Transcribe qualifications in the following manner:  2.6.1.1.1. For tasks previously certified and required in the current duty position, circle the subparagraph number next to the task statement and enter the current date in the completion column. Trainee initials in the trainee column and the current supervisor/trainer initials in the trainer column. Rationale: Clarifies transcribing documentation procedures.  2.6.1.1.2. When transcribing previous certification for tasks not required in the current duty position, carry forward only the previous completion date of certification (not the initials  30  of another person). If and when these tasks become duty position requirements, recertify using standard certification procedures.  2.6.1.1.3. The person whose initials appear in the trainer block during the transcription process must meet those requirements.  2.6.1.1.4.  Upon  completion  of  the  transcription  process,  give  the  old  CFETP  to  the member.  2.6.1.2. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available, the supervisor identifies  STS  training  references  that  the  trainee  requires  for  career  knowledge  and ensures, at a minimum, that trainees cover the mandatory items in AFECD. For two-time CDC course exam failures, supervisors identify all STS items corresponding to the areas covered  by  the  CDC.  The  trainee  completes  a  study  of  STS  references,  undergoes evaluation by the supervisor, and receives certification on the STS items. NOTE: Career Knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver.  2.6.1.3. Decertification and Recertification. When a supervisor or trainer determines an Airman is unqualified on a task previously certified for their duty position, the supervisor erases the previous  certification, or deletes certification when using automated system. Appropriate remarks pertaining to the reason for decertification are entered on the AF Form 623a  or  automated  version.  Begin  recertification  (if  required)  following  procedures  in accordance with AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.  2.6.2. Training Standard. Tasks in the 3 level course are trained to the partially proficient level, meaning the individual can perform the task, needing help only with the hardest part. OJT tasks are trained and qualified to the “go/no go” level. “Go” means the stage at which an individual has gained enough skill, knowledge, and experience to perform the tasks without supervision. “No” means the trainee has not gained enough skill, knowledge, and experience to perform task without supervision.   *3.

Requirements.  5.1.  The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology (USD (A&T)) has approved checklists for the acquisition workforce under the authority of DOD Directive 5000.52, “Defense Acquisition Education, Training and Career Development Program.”  5.1.2.  The  checklists  provide  a  concise  description  of  the  education,  experience,  and training  required  to  meet  the  standards  for  certification  in  acquisition  career  fields  for Contracting Level I, Contracting Level II, and Contracting Level III.   5.1.3.
