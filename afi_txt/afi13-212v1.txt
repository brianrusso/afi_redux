Purpose.  This  instruction  provides  guidance  for  commanders  to  operate  assigned  ranges safely,  effectively,  and  efficiently  to  meet  training  and  test  requirements  while  minimizing potential effects on the environment and the surrounding communities. 1.2.  Scope. 1.2.1.  This instruction applies to all United States Air Force (USAF) operated air and ground ranges listed in Attachment 2.  Guidance for the Space Test and Training Range and Cyber ranges will be published in a separate volume.  Space launch ranges and those dedicated to small  arms  training  addressed  in  AFI  36-2226,  Combat  Arms  Program,  are  not  covered  by this instruction.  USAF-operated air and ground ranges outside of the United States (US) will comply  with instruction,  Department  of  Defense  Directive  (DoDD)  4715.12, Environmental  and  Explosives  Safety  Management  on  Operational  Ranges  Outside  the United States, and/or host-nation rules, whichever is more restrictive. this 1.2.2.  Attachment 2 is intended to be the definitive list of ranges covered by this instruction.  AF  organizations  conducting  range  activities,  as  defined  in  Title  10  of  United  States  Code (10 U.S.C.) Section (§) 101(e)(2), at locations other than those listed in  Attachment 2 must contact  the  Publication  OPR  (through  the  parent  MAJCOM)  for  a  coverage  review  unless one or more of the criteria listed in the following subparagraphs are met: 1.2.2.1.  The activity is conducted at a AF operated range listed in Attachment 2. 1.2.2.2.  The activity is specifically excluded in paragraph 1.2.1. 1.2.2.3.  The  activity  is  conducted  at  an  operational  range  operated  by  another  military service, federal agency, or a host nation, IAW the rules and procedures established by the organization  operating  the  range.    Note:  while  this  AFI  only  applies  to  AF-operated ranges, ranges operated by non-AF entities that are located on AF real property (e.g., test sites located on an AF installation) should be required to comply with applicable portions of  this  instruction  via  a  host-tenant  agreement  to  ensure  safety  and  stewardship  of  AF property. 1.2.2.4.  The activity requires airspace only (no land or water surface component), and is conducted IAW AF, Department of Defense (DoD), and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or host nation airspace regulations. 1.2.2.5.  The activity consists of training involving drop zones and/or landing zones, and is conducted IAW AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations. 1.2.2.6.  The  activity  consists  of  training  conducted  off  federal  real  property.    Refer  to DoDI  1322.28,  Realistic  Military  Training  (RMT)  Off  Federal  Real  Property,  for requirements and procedures for this type of activity. 1.2.3.  If  the  coverage  review  determines  the  activity  is  within  the  scope  and  intent  of  this instruction, the AFI will apply and Attachment 2 will be updated accordingly.   6  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 1.3.  Description of Ranges.  A range is an area established for range activities as set forth in 10 U.S.C.  §  101(e)(2).    These  activities  include  training,  research  and  development,  and  test  and evaluation  of  military  systems,  personnel,  tactics,  munitions,  and  explosives.    Air  and  ground ranges  are  typically  described  in  terms  of  the  range  capabilities  and  the  activities  conducted within a specific geographic area. 1.3.1.  Primary Training Range (PTR).  PTRs are established to accommodate training.  They are not designed or structured to accommodate test and evaluation activities. 1.3.2.  Major  Range  and  Test  Facility  Base  (MRTFB).    DoDD  3200.11,  Major  Range  and Test  Facility  Base  (MRTFB);  AFI  99-109,  Major  Range  and  Test  Facility  Base  (MRTFB) Test  and Evaluation  Resource Planning;  and this instruction govern specific DoD  Test  and Evaluation  (T&E)  activities.    Although  the  MRTFB  functions  primarily  in  support  of  DoD test  and  evaluation  missions,  they  also  support  training  and  other  range  activities.    The MRTFB  is  financed  through  a  combination  of  appropriated  (institutional)  funds  and  user charges IAW DoD 7000.14-R, DoD Financial Management Regulation. 1.3.3.  Test  Sites.    These  sites  are  developed  and  used  for  specific  Developmental  Test  and Evaluation  (DT&E)  and  Operational  Test  and  Evaluation  (OT&E)  requirements.    They  are considered ranges under this instruction due to the scope, nature and frequency of conducting many of the defined range activities. 1.4.  Range  Test  and  Training  Activities.  The  land  or  sea  encompassed  within  the  Hazard Area or underlying an air-to-air range used for actual weapon employment must be protected by purchase, lease, or other means to ensure the safety of personnel, structures, and the public from expended weapons, laser and electromagnetic emissions, and target debris. 1.4.1.  Surface-to-Surface.    Surface-to-Surface  test  and  training  cover  a  wide  range  of mission  requirements,  including  survivability  test,  horizontal  and  vertical  live-fire  events, surface  and  subsurface  tests  in  international  waters,  Research  and  Development  (R&D), Directed Energy Weapons (DEW), explosives operations, heavy weapons qualification, and Explosive  Ordnance  Disposal  (EOD)  thermal  treatment  and  disposal.    Ranges  that  support Special  Operations  Forces  (SOF)  and  other  ground  test  and  training  requirements  may require  substantial  ground  infrastructure,  including  shoot  houses,  urban  villages,  laser scoring,  in-band  imaging,  complex  communication  and  instrumentation,  range  surveillance radars and other facilities. 1.4.2.  Air-to-Surface.   Air-to-Surface test and training may  require a substantial  amount of range space and a sophisticated infrastructure to support complex, multi-aircraft operations; air-to-surface  munition,  cruise  missile,  and  DEW  employment;  aeronautical  system  testing; unmanned vehicles; airdrop; and battlefield operations.  This infrastructure may include high and/or  low  fidelity  threat  simulators,  visual  threat  simulators,  scoring  capabilities,  realistic target communication  networks,  data display/processing  capabilities,  instrumentation/debrief  systems,  flight  termination  systems, and flight hazard analysis/strike prediction capability. command systems, arrays, and control 1.4.3.  Electronic Warfare.  Locations supporting Electronic Warfare (EW) training must be capable of providing a simulated electronic threat environment for aircrew combat training.  Electronic  Warfare  Ranges  (EWRs)  are  located  on  a  range  (usually  a  range  capable  of receiving  surface  fires  and  actual  ordnance  delivery).    Electronic  Warfare  Sites  (EWSs) AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   7  typically provide EW simulation and feedback, but are not located on a range.  An EWS can be established at any location with proper security.  Typically, they are located under or near a Military Training Route (MTR) or Military Operations Area (MOA). 1.4.4.  Surface-to-Air.    Surface-to-Air  test  and  training  cover  a  wide  range  of  mission requirements.    Ranges  that  support,  for  example,  endo-atmospheric  and  exo-atmospheric missile  intercepts,  aeronautical  system  testing,  and  ballistic  missiles  require  a  substantial amount  of  range  space  and  a  sophisticated  range  infrastructure.    This  infrastructure  may include high fidelity simulators, visual simulators, end-game scoring capabilities, command and  control  systems,  communications  networks,  data  display/processing  capabilities, instrumentation  systems,  flight  termination  systems,  and  flight  hazard  analysis/strike prediction capability. 1.4.5.  Air-to-Air.  Air-to-Air test and training  cover a  wide range of mission requirements, such as air-to-air operations involving simulated  and actual  employment  of missiles, air-to-air  gunnery,  aeronautical  system  testing,  unmanned  vehicles,  and  EW,  which  require  a substantial  amount  of  range  space  and  a  sophisticated  range  infrastructure.    This infrastructure  may  include  high  fidelity  simulators,  visual  simulators,  end-game  scoring capabilities, data display/processing  capabilities,  instrumentation  systems,  flight  termination  systems,  and flight hazard analysis/strike prediction capability.  Note: live air-to-air gunnery training uses towed  targets  and  drones,  so  the  aircraft  performance  capabilities  and  the  appropriate munitions ballistics tables must be used to determine the airspace and surface area required for safe operations. communication command networks, and control systems, 1.4.6.  Air Combat Training System (ACTS).  Training utilizing ACTS supplements the other listed  range  activities  by  instrumenting  aircraft,  airspaces,  and  ranges  to  support  real-time observation and assessment of the training as well as post-mission playback for debriefing. 1.4.6.1.  Tethered  flight  instrumentation  range  systems  provide  Time-Space-Position-Information  (TSPI)  and  model  weapons  impact  or  flyout  for  aircrew  kill  notification using  ground-based  computers,  towers,  and  communications  relays  and  aircraft  pods  or internal avionics.  These systems also provide real-time live monitor capability for Range Training Officer oversight of the training. 1.4.6.2.  Rangeless/untethered flight instrumentation range systems use autonomous pods, aircraft  avionics  or  recording  devices  of  participating  aircraft  to  provide  capabilities similar to a tethered system.  Pod-to-Pod or aircraft data links can relay kill predictions to participating aircraft for near-real time kill notification.  Rangeless/untethered systems do not provide a real-time live monitor data feed to a Range Training Officer. 1.4.7.  Live,  Virtual,  and  Constructive  (LVC)  Augmentation.    Live  airspace  and  range operations  may  be  augmented  with  virtual  mission  simulators  and/or  computer-generated constructive models and simulations to tailor or enhance range capabilities to  meet  specific test and training objectives. 1.4.8.  USAF  Range  Service  Levels.    Ranges  provide  different  levels  of  service  dependent upon  several  factors,  such  as  hours  of  manned  operation,  scheduled  test  and  training activities, utilization, etc.  For example, a Range under the MRTFB may provide both Class   8  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 A and Class T service on different parts of the range or at different times; a PTR may provide Class A service during daylight hours but Class C service during nighttime hours. 1.4.8.1.  Class A service.  Class A service provides a manned, ground-scoring and/or EW capable  range  with  a  Range  Control  Officer  (RCO)  present  on  range  and  controlling surface activities and operations. 1.4.8.2.  Class  B  service.    Class  B  service  provides  a  manned  or  unmanned,  ground-scoring  and/or  EW  capable  range  where  no  RCO  is  present  on  range  for  controlling surface  activities  and  operations.    Note:  Class  B  service  includes  ranges  where  a remotely-sited  range  operations  center  monitors  air  and  ground  operations  and  provides scoring feedback. 1.4.8.3.  Class C service.  Class C service provides an unmanned range with no scoring, no EW services and no RCO control of ground activities or operations. 1.4.8.4.  Class  D  service.    Class  D  service  provides  an  instrumented  range  supporting operations monitored by a Range Training Officer (RTO). 1.4.8.5.  Class T service.  Class T service provides a manned or unmanned range or test site  intended  for  test  activities  and  explosives/weapons  detonations,  controlled  by  the ROA.    For  weapons  systems  development  and  test  missions,  the  ROA  will  ensure  the applicable  RCO  functions  are  performed  by  a  RCO,  range  controller  or  assigned  test supervisor, competent in range operating procedures and the test activities related to the specific missions and profiles. 1.5.

Range Safety Personnel. 2.10.1.  All  RSOs  and  FSOs  are  responsible  for  advising  the  ROA  on  the  safe  conduct  of range operations. 2.10.2.  Test Safety personnel have additional safety responsibilities, and reflect those of the person  conducting  on-site  or  direct,  real-time  monitoring  of  range  operations.    Duties  may vary by the type of operation:  For Class T services, the RSO duties are typically performed by  the  RCO/TACO.    For  tests  requiring  the  monitoring  of  a  system  or  operation  from  a mission  control  facility  (e.g.,  a  weapon  flight  test  with  a  Flight  Termination  System  (FTS) installed)  the  safety  function  is  usually  performed  by  an  RSO  on  a  console.    For  small  test operations (e.g., a munitions/explosives test) the on-site safety function may be performed by the  Test  Director/Manager.    Regardless  of  the  personnel  or  event,  some  basic  on-site  RSO responsibilities are: 2.10.2.1.  Be  on-site  at  the  operation  or  in  a  position  to  have  real-time  situational awareness of events, personnel and assets. (T1). 2.10.2.2.

Comprehensive  Range  Planning.  Comprehensive  Range  Planning  is  accomplished  to ensure  training  and  testing  requirements  are  met.    This  process  evaluates  range  requirements against  current  and  projected  capabilities  to  identify  shortfalls  and  to  guide  sustainable  range development  to  mitigate  the  shortfalls.    This  instruction  and  a  hierarchy  of  plans  provide  the policy and guidance that documents the current sustainment and future range development. 3.1.1.  Air Force Ranges Strategic Plan. 3.1.1.1.  AF/A3OJR  publishes  an  AF  Ranges  Strategic  Plan  to  identify  service-wide needs  and  desired  strategic  direction.    AF/A3OJR  will  initiate  a  review  process  for  the AF  Ranges  Strategic  Plan  every  four  years  in  conjunction  with  the  development  and release  of  the  Quadrennial  Defense  Review  (QDR).    The  plan  has  a  ten-year  planning horizon. 3.1.1.2.  The  AF  Ranges  Strategic  Plan  consolidates  the  inputs  from  MAJCOMs,  test entities, other Services and agencies as applicable to guide enterprise planning.  The plan takes  into  consideration  the  way  test  and  training  events  are  conducted.    As  weapons systems,  instrumentation,  threat  systems,  and  testing  technologies  are  developed,  the Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  (TTPs),  Designed  Operational  Capability  (DOC) statement  missions,  and  training  events  change  over  time.    As  these  changes  occur,  the strategic  plan  must  consider  the  following  domains  in  which  test  and  training  can  be conducted: 3.1.1.2.1.  Live – humans operating actual operational  weapons systems  with  real  or replicated threat systems and/or targets on the range. 3.1.1.2.2.  Virtual – people operating any type of simulator. 3.1.1.2.3.  Constructive – computer generated entities used to enhance training. 3.1.2.  Air Force Training Requirements.  Range training-support requirements are based on the Major Weapons System (MWS) and DOC statement missions and training events of the assigned  units.  The  Ready  Aircrew  Program  (RAP),  MWS  Volume  (Vol)  1,  training publications and syllabi normally provide the specific events that require range support.  The MWS Events and Assigned Range Users data (Attachments 3 and 4) is a compilation of the applicable events, required range capability and infrastructure for each specific training event and  are  based  on  the  current  practices.    As  MWS,  mission  types  or  training  events,  and/or TTPs  change  to  meet  emerging  threats  and  technologies,  the  MAJCOM  Training  Review Boards  (TRB)  are  instituted  to  maximize  the  quality  of  unit  training  and  convene  (usually annually) to update training events, frequency and standards. 3.1.2.1.  The  TRBs  normally  review  current  and  draft  unit  DOC  statements,  inspection schedules  and  exercise  scenarios.    They  also  review  operations  mishap  trends  to  help identify  training  shortfalls/concerns;  Operations  Group  Commander  inputs  and  ongoing initiatives  to  improve  the  quality  of  unit  training  throughout  the  respective  Combat  Air Forces (CAF), Mobility Air Forces (MAF), and SOF; and proposed training requirement (RAP tasking, Vol 1) changes for each crew position by weapon system.   24  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 3.1.2.2.  Typically,  the  TRB  goals  include  ensuring  DOC  statements  reflect  current OPLAN and AEF taskings; training is such that units can meet their DOC missions with commensurate  combat  capability  levels  and  the  associated  training  risks  are  weighed against  all  factors;  units  are  training  appropriately  to  meet  current  threats  in  applicable AORs;  exercise  scenarios  match  unit  wartime  missions  and  training  emphasis;  and guidance is updated to help prevent future mishaps. 3.1.2.3.  At  a  minimum,  MAJCOMs  shall  biennially  review  applicable  portions  of  the CAF,  MAF  and  SOF  TRB  recommendations;  range  user  assignments;  the  range-supported  MWS  events;  and  other  applicable training-requirements  documents.  Following the review, the MAJCOMs, through ACC as the lead-MAJCOM, will provide AF/A3OJR  with  inputs  on  recommended  changes  to  the  MWS  Events  and  Assigned Range Users data (Attachments 3 and 4). 3.1.2.3.1.  The  biennial  review  should  ensure  a  specific  range  has  been  tasked  to support  each  specific  training  event  and  that  it  has  the  required  capability  to  do  so.  Shortfalls  necessitating  a  change  to  assigned  users,  or  capability  and  infrastructure investments  shall  be  supported  and  based  on  the  published  data.    Any  necessary changes  to  assigned  users,  events  or  capabilities  should  be  forwarded  from  ACC  to AF/A3OJR for review and inclusion into this AFI. 3.1.2.3.2.  User-event  assignments  should  consider  geographic  proximity  as  well  as the scope and attributes required for the assigned event.  Planners should not assign a specific unit to more than one range for the same range event. 3.1.2.3.3.  When a MAJCOM does not have an adequate or close-proximity range to support  one  of  its  units,  the  MAJCOM  will  engage  other  range-owning  MAJCOMs and  Services  for  support  and  assignment  of  their  units.    If  the  shortfall  cannot  be serviced, the proponent MAJCOM will submit a T/TSNS to AF/A3OJR for resolution at the General Officer level. 3.1.2.4.  During  the  biennial  review,  MAJCOMs  should  review  test  and  training requirements  to  determine  the  LVC  mix  and  to  determine  if  changes  to  the  range requirements  are  needed.    This  creates  a  requirement  for  a  continuous  modernization program that will meet test objectives, increase combat realism, aid tactics development, enhance day-to-day training, and move toward a balanced and appropriate LVC mix. 3.1.3.  Non-AF  Training  Requirements  at  PTRs.    Support  of  non-Air  Force  unit  training events  on Air  Force  ranges is  often based on historical  agreements  and/or related to  basing decisions.   This  support  may  establish  additional  range  financial  obligations  and requirements and must be documented by a written agreement as outlined in paragraph 4.2. 3.1.3.1.  The ROA, in coordination with the MAJCOM, will identify the specific events, training  priority,  and  related  range  capabilities  and  infrastructure  needed  to  support  the training  (T2);  and  will  determine  if  the  range  has  the  capacity  to  support  the  event(s) while continuing to meet its obligations to the assigned USAF users. (T2). 3.1.3.2.  If  additional  operating  hours,  capabilities,  equipment  or  infrastructure  are required  to  support  the  training,  the  ROA  will  document  those  costs  in  the  written agreement  and  will  coordinate  for  reimbursement  as  authorized.  (T1).    Ranges  will  not assume  training  requirements  or  develop/procure  capabilities  to  support  users  that  have AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   25  not been assigned to them in this instruction, unless documented in a written agreement which has been approved by the range-operating MAJCOM and AF/A3OJR. (T1). 3.1.4.  Training  Priority  at  PTRs.    Priority  is  normally  determined  by  the  range-operating Wing.    The  range-operating  Wings  and  individual  ranges  must  schedule  effectively  to adequately support each assigned user in the assigned event as well as non-USAF users who have  entered into  a written agreement for support.   Ranges  are authorized to  provide range access  and training support  on a space-available  basis to  non-assigned units but  those units should not normally have priority above assigned users. 3.1.5.  Training-Support Requirements at MRTFB ranges.  IAW DoDD 3200.11, the MRTFB may  be  used  by  DoD  users  and  by  users  outside  the  Department  such  as  US  Government Agencies, State and local governments, allied foreign governments, and commercial entities for  training  events.    The  training  requirements  must  be  clearly  articulated  to  determine  the levels of support needed and the priority of the activity. 3.1.6.  Training Priority at MRTFB Ranges.  IAW DoDD 3200.11, scheduling of the MRTFB shall  be  based  upon  a  priority  system  that  gives  equitable  consideration  to  all  DoD Components  and  accommodates  DoD  acquisition  program  priorities.  The  Test  Resource Management Center (TRMC) implements the composition, sizing and usage for the MRTFB.  Priority for training operations on MRTFB ranges is coordinated at the local level through a robust  scheduling  and  prioritization  process  that  takes  into  account  both  test  and  training requirements needed to support all users. 3.1.7.  Range Test-Support Requirements.  Test requirements are based on the characteristics and  attributes  of  the  specific  test  and  are  governed  by  Departmental  and  Service-level Directives  and  Instructions.    MAJCOMs,  Acquisition  Programs,  SAF/AQ,  and  AF/TE collaboratively define the test requirements and the resources necessary to support them. 3.1.8.  Aligning  and  Deconflicting  Test  and  Training  Requirements.    Within  the  Air  Force, the investments needed for test requirements may also be needed for training, and vice versa.  It is imperative to avoid redundancy and gain synergy by closely aligning and deconflicting test  and  training  requirements.    Coordinating  these  requirements  is  fiscally  responsible  and will result in a more effective use of limited resources. 3.1.8.1.  Investments for the ranges under the MRTFB serve test and evaluation as well as training  requirements.    Infrastructure  investments  at  these  locations  are  planned  and allocated  through  different  processes,  PEs  and  special  access  programs.    As  advanced weapons systems and threats are developed and tested, the associated  TTP development and training execution drive the necessity for increased synergy and coordination. 3.1.8.2.  The Air Force Test and Training Infrastructure Council (AFTTIC) integrates AF test and training requirement stakeholders into a forum  where investment  strategies  can be  coordinated.    This  council  ensures  investment  compatibility  and  synergy,  minimizes duplication of range infrastructure and consolidates range investment priorities. 3.1.9.  Test  and  Training  Resource  Programs.    Test  and  training  requirements  are  funded through  a  combination  of  institutional  funds  and  reimbursements  and/or  customer  fees  at MRTFB ranges.  Test and Training resource funding is managed through Air Force and other DoD  unique  PEs.    Execution  is  accomplished  by  various  Air  Force  field  activities.  Headquarters  Air  Force,  Test  and  Evaluation  Infrastructure  and  Resource  Team  (HQ   26  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 USAF/TEP) provides test and evaluation resources oversight and guidance to the Air Force MRTFBs through the parent MAJCOM.  The Headquarters Air Force Ranges, Airspace, and Operations  Sustainment  Office  (AF/A3OJR)  provides  training  resources  oversight  and guidance  to  the  Air  Force  MRTFBs  and  together  with  the  National  Guard  Bureau,  Air National Guard Air Space and Ranges Division (ANG NGB/A3A) to the PTRs. 3.1.9.1.  Training O&M.  PE 27604 and PE 52634 funds PTR O&M, and is programmed by  ACC  and  NGB/A3  (respectively)  through  the  Air  Superiority  Core  Function  Team.  Individual  MAJCOM’s  execute  funding  in  these  PEs  for  their  assigned  ranges.    The program  funds range contracts,  certain  range personnel  and operations and maintenance of range capabilities.  It also funds technical and service contracts to maintain operating hours and the basic infrastructure for scoring activities, threat  and debrief systems,  data link capabilities and other range services such as road maintenance and range clean up. 3.1.9.2.  Test O&M.  AFI 99-109 details the PEs and execution agents for Air Force test requirements. 3.1.9.3.  NTTR and Utah Test & Training Range (UTTR) O&M.  PE 27428 funds NTTR and UTTR O&M, and is programmed by ACC through the Air Superiority Core Function Team.    ACC  is  also  the  executing  agent  for  this  program.    The  program  funds  range contracts, certain range personnel, and operations and maintenance of range capabilities.  It  also  funds  technical  and  service  contracts  to  maintain  operating  hours  and  the  basic infrastructure  for  scoring  activities,  telemetry,  threat  and  debrief  systems,  data  link capabilities and other range services such as road maintenance and range clean up. 3.1.9.4.  Improvements/Investments. 3.1.9.4.1.  Test and Training Space.  Test and Training space attributes accommodate missions based on TTPs and event requirements.  When range planners project a unit readiness decline due to a deficiency or gap in range capabilities, MAJCOMs should first  attempt  to  shift  the  unit  assignment  to  a  range  with  the  required  capability,  or submit  a  T/TSNS  to  meet  the  shortfall.    Such  actions  involving  acquisition,  use, creation, modification, or transfer of range land or airspace generate significant O&M obligation,  public  interest  and  environmental  impacts.    The  Air  Force  must  be prepared to address budgeting and fiscal constraints as well as concerns raised at the local,  regional,  or national  level  during the development  or lifespan of  any  range or airspace acquisition or action. (including ranges  or  permanent  airspace),  except 3.1.9.4.1.1.  Any action to establish, change use of, modify, or delete test/training space those  purely administrative  in  nature,  are  reviewed  by  units,  MAJCOMs,  and  HQ  USAF  via the  T/TSNS  process  detailed  in  AFI  13-201.  (T1).    Any  changes/closures  to MRTFB ranges that affect capabilities or capacity of the MRTFB must follow the guidelines  and  approval  process  established  in  DoDI  3200.18,  Management  and Operation  of  the  Major  Range  and  Test  Facility  Base.  (T0).    Proposal development  will  comply  with  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969 (NEPA),  42  U.S.C.  §§  4321–4347.  (T0).    Proposals  can  consider  single  (i.e., distinct)  actions  or  numerous  actions  covered  by  an  overarching  plan  (i.e., Comprehensive  Range  Plans).    NEPA  requires  proponents  for  all  major  federal projects  to  consider  environmental  impacts  prior  to  making  an  irreversible  or AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   27  irretrievable  commitment  of  resources  (personnel,  facilities  or  dollars).    While NEPA  does  not  require  the  decision-maker  to  choose  the  most  environmentally advantageous alternative, it does require the decision-maker to make an informed decision and consider all potential impacts.  Refer to 32 CFR Part 989 for specific guidance.  Note: for proposals involving expansion of range boundaries, whether permanent  or  otherwise,  the  T/TSNS  must  also  be  coordinated  with  the  AFCEC Military  Munitions  Response  Program  (MMRP)  office  to  identify  conflicts  and impacts related to current or projected AF MRRP projects. 3.1.9.4.1.2.  Airspace Establishment and Land Acquisition. 3.1.9.4.1.2.1.  Airspace.    Before  establishing  a  need  for  new  airspace, proponents must ensure they comply with AFI 13-201, 32 CFR Part 989, and applicable FAA Orders & Directives. 3.1.9.4.1.2.2.  Land.  Land acquisitions require lead times as long as 7  years.  There  are  a  variety  of  mechanisms  for  acquiring  land.    Examples  include traditional  buy/lease  transactions,  or  withdrawal  under  the  FLPMA  (see  also “Land  Withdrawal”  in  terms  section  of  Attachment  1).    Proponents  need  to work through the Base Civil Engineer with the Unit/MAJCOM, SAF/IE, and AFCEC  to  acquire  land  IAW  AFI  32-9001,  Acquisition  of  Real  Property.  Factors  to  be  examined  when  considering  the  acquisition  of  land  include confirmation  that  the  proposal  cannot  be  accommodated  within  or  by modifying existing areas, and issues associated with procuring private land or withdrawing  federal  lands.    The  FLPMA  and  Title  43,  United  States  Code, Sections  155-158,  Engle  Act,  require  Congressional  approval  for  any  public land  withdrawal,  reservation,  or  restriction  of  over  5,000  acres  for  any  DoD project or facility.  In addition, proponents need to prepare an Environmental Baseline  Survey IAW  AFI  32-7066, Environmental Baseline Surveys in Real Estate Transactions. land  acquisitions (EBS) for 3.1.9.4.1.2.3.  If  funding  for  range  real  estate  is  received  in  one  allotment, acquisition  for  all  lands  should  proceed  immediately.    If  funds  are  received incrementally  over  multiple  budget  cycles,  acquisition  should  proceed according  to  a  plan  that  will  obtain  an  initial  operational  capability  at  the earliest date.  For example, a range  complex providing one Class A and two Class  C  service  areas  can  be  acquired  in  three  increments.    Funds  from  the first increment should be used to acquire lands providing the highest benefit to the Air Force.  Each increment should provide an operational capability of its own. 3.1.9.4.1.2.4.  Other  Agency  Coordination.    Agreements  with  other  federal, state,  local,  and  tribal  government  agencies  should  be  finalized  and  signed during the acquisition phase.  In some locations, USAF ranges require liaison and  coordination  with  many  agencies livestock management, fish and wildlife conservation, forest management, immigration and border control, irrigation development, etc.  It is important that any issues affecting  operations  or  safety  be  settled  before  the  range  activation  date.  Installation  Commanders  with  jurisdiction  over  an  AF  range  must  ensure in  connection  with   28  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   Coordination liaison and coordination with appropriate agencies of federal, state, local, and tribal  governments. IAW  Executive  Order  12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs, 14 July 1982, is required for any actions that might influence another agency's plans, programs, or projects.  Tribal  relations  are  governed  by  AFI  90-2002,  Air  Force  Interactions  with Federally-Recognized Tribes. 3.1.9.4.1.3.  Moving  or  establishing  a  live  munitions  area  is  a  Major  Action  and requires extensive planning and approval.  To do so, the ROA will accomplish a T/TSNS  and  will  comply  with  the  EIAP  with  the  assistance  of  the  parent MAJCOM. (T0). 3.1.9.4.1.4.  Closing or Transferring of Ranges.  Ranges under the MRTFB must follow OSD processes before reducing or closing capability IAW DoDI 3200.18. (T0).    For  PTRs  and  non-MRTFB  test  ranges,  when  declared  in  excess  to  the range  requirements  by  the  ROA,  the  MAJCOM  and  AF/A3OJR,  land  will  be surface  cleared  in  accordance  with  AF  standards.  The  ROA  will  notify  the supporting CE organization with  real  property  responsibility of the  excess  status for subsequent action to determine a new use and accomplish required clearance for the new use. (T1).  It is Air Force policy to clear to a level deemed safe for the proposed future land use and issue Certificates of Clearance for excess ranges or ranges  converted  to  other  uses  but  remaining  on  the  installation  property inventory.  The  supporting  CE  organization  will  ensure  clearance  IAW  DoDI 3200.16  Operational  Range  Clearance,  excess  declaration  IAW  AFI  32-9004, Disposal of Real Property, and NEPA actions IAW 32 CFR Part 989.  Airspace transfer  will  be  IAW  AFI  13-201,  and  disposition  of  government  owned  range equipment and facilities will be IAW MAJCOM guidance. 3.1.9.4.2.  Range Equipment and Infrastructure.  Range equipment and infrastructure systems provide instrumentation for numerous functions, including OT&E, readiness training, tactics development and evaluation, command and control, safety, and real-time  flight  monitoring.    Ideally,  these  systems  provide  precise  monitoring  and reconstruction,  and  facilitate  post-mission  debriefing  of  range  users  for  various mission  sets  (i.e.,  single  or  multiple  aircraft,  ground  training,  and  test  missions),  to include  reactions  to  air  defense  threats,  live  or  simulated  ordnance  exchanges,  and realistic  simulations  of  the  projected  threat  environment.    The  requirement  for continuous modernization of these systems drives investments in this area. 3.1.9.4.2.1.  Test infrastructure is a key contributor to the test process.  AFPD 99-1  states,  “The  Air  Force  will  operate,  maintain,  and  improve  T&E  facilities, including the Major Range and Test Facility Base and USAF Test Pilot School, in support  of  Air  Force,  DoD,  and  other  user  requirements.    The  Air  Force  will continually  evaluate  test  infrastructure  requirements  and  capabilities  to  ensure critical  test  infrastructure  is  available  when  needed,  and  avoid  unnecessary duplication of test resources IAW DoDD 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).” 3.1.9.4.2.2.  The  Test  Investment  Planning  and  Programming  (TIPP)  Process provides the venue for investing in test infrastructure and is further defined in AFI AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   29  99-109.    HQ  AFMC/A3  manages  the  Air  Force  TIPP  process  to  identify  test resource  investments  needed  to  support  military  systems  testing.    Those investments that have possible multi-Service applicability may be referred to the Central Test  and Evaluation  Investment Program  (CTEIP) for funding  IAW AFI 99-109. 3.1.9.4.3.  When  a  range  projects  that  equipment  or  infrastructure  deficiencies  will prohibit them from supporting an assigned training event or an emerging requirement, the  ROA  should  coordinate  with  the  MAJCOM  to  have  the  mission  reassigned, arrange  for  O&M  funding,  or  coordinate  acquisition  of  the  required  equipment  or infrastructure  with  the  lead  MAJCOM  (ACC).    AFSOC  may  seek  funding  that supports SOF unique training and has SOF sustainment.  In these cases, AFSOC will coordinate  with  the  lead  MAJCOM  if  it  will  affect  other  AF  range  users.    The acquisition  of  any  EW  equipment  asset  (threat  systems,  jammers,  simulator,  etc.), instrumentation,  communication  systems  or  advanced/moving  targets  used  for training  shall  be  coordinated  through  the  lead  operating  command  to  assist  in validating  the  requirement,  defining  the  priority  and  justifying  the  initial  and recurring expenditures. (T1). 3.1.9.4.4.  Improvement of existing threats systems is accomplished through AFI 21-118,  Improving  Air  and  Space  Equipment  Reliability  and  Maintainability.    This instruction establishes the Electronic Warfare (EW) and ACTS Product Improvement Working Group (PIWG), which is co-chaired by the Range Threat Systems Program Office (SPO) and ACC/A3AR.  The PIWG interacts with and receives feedback from equipment  users,  jointly  establish  priorities  for  future  efforts,  develops  solutions  to Reliability & Maintainability (R&M) problems, and provides updates concerning on-going efforts. 3.1.9.4.5.  HQ  ACC  is  the  lead  agency  for  procurement  of  Instrumentation,  Threat Systems,  and  Test/Training  Range  Engineering  Development  supporting  CAF requirements. 3.1.9.4.5.1.  The  Air  Force  Operational  Test  and  Evaluation  Center  (AFOTEC) will  coordinate  on  CAF  requirements  that  need  an  OT&E  input  or  may  affect OT&E  as  well  as  DT&E,  Force  Development  Evaluation  (FDE),  JT&E,  and Expeditionary Force Experiments (EFX). 3.1.9.4.5.2.  HQ  ACC/A3A  will  develop  and  maintain  an  Equipment  Inventory and  Configuration  Control  system,  as  part  of  the  ERP.    It  should  accurately inventory, track equipment, and document the configuration and threat lay-down plan of threat emitters and simulators used for training. 3.1.9.4.5.3.  The  reallocation  of  threat  systems  will  be  coordinated  by  HQ ACC/A3A with the affected MAJCOMs and AF/A3OJR, with AF/A3 arbitrating any  disputes.    Note:  this  paragraph  is  not  intended  to  apply  to  maintenance-related movements, such as transfers to/from depot. 3.1.9.4.6.  New  ACTS  Requirements.    New  requirements  will  be  forwarded  to ACC/A3A  through  the  Realistic  Training  Review  Board  (RTRB).    Requests  to   30  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 modify  existing  equipment  will  be  submitted  using  AF  Form  1067,  Modification Proposal. 3.1.9.4.7.  Requests for Disposition of Equipment.  No threat or range instrumentation system  will  be  deactivated,  transferred,  or  decommissioned  without  MAJCOM approval.    All  deactivation/decommission  and  final  disposition  requests  will  be approved  by  the  parent  MAJCOM  and  HQ  ACC  with  AF/A3OJR  arbitrating  any disputes. 3.1.9.4.8.  Urban Training Facilities.  Constructing or upgrading semi-permanent and permanent  Urban  Training  Facilities,  as  defined  and  covered  in  DoDI  1322.27, requires advance coordination.  All such proposals require evaluation, and proposals which will be funded via MILCON also require certification by the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&R)).  ROAs shall submit proposal information (to include the items listed in Enclosure 3 of DoDI 1322.27) through the MAJCOM  and  lead  MAJCOM  to  AF/A3OJR  prior  to  initiating  development  or procurement  of  these  capabilities.  (T0).    AFSOC  may  submit  proposals  directly  to AF/A3OJR for projects that support SOF unique training and have SOF sustainment.  A3OJR will consult with OSD, as appropriate, to identify evaluation and certification requirements for the proposal. 3.1.10.  Enterprise  Range  Plan  (ERP).    ACC,  as  the  lead-MAJCOM,  will  produce  an Enterprise Range Plan to coordinate with AF/A3OJR prior to publication.  The plan should have a ten-year planning horizon and support the Air Force Ranges Strategic Plan. 3.1.10.1.  The ERP will identify the current mission of each range and identify the range requirements.    This  includes  detailing  necessary  test  and  training  capabilities  as  well  as specifying  training  requirements  for  the  assigned  users.    It  should  compare  current  and known future requirements against the current range capabilities to identify shortfalls and describe  investment  actions  within  each  of  the  ten  investment  areas  described  in paragraph 3.1.11.2.3. 3.1.10.2.  The  ERP  should  provide  tailored  direction  to  each  range  to  guide  their comprehensive  range  planning.    Plan  development  provides  an  opportunity  for  all MAJCOM  organizations  and  staff  to  provide  inputs,  coordinate  actions  within  the commands and across the MAJCOM staffs.  ACC will coordinate the plan with all other MAJCOMs to ensure their needs and concerns are addressed. 3.1.11.  Comprehensive Range Plans (CRPs).  Each range will maintain a CRP that outlines the  ROA’s  vision  and  strategy  to  meet  the  customer  test  requirements  and  the  training requirements  of  the  assigned  users  while  considering  the  interests  of  range  supporting organizations. (T2). 3.1.11.1.  CRP Installation OPR.  The ROA is the installation OPR for the CRP and will review/update  the  plan  biennially  and  revise  it  at  least  every  four  years  or  whenever significant  changes  occur.  (T2).    CRPs  will  be  coordinated  with  all  range  supporting organizations prior to submitting to the MAJCOM for review and approval. (T2).  CRPs for  new  ranges  require  additional  approval  of  AF/A3OJR  (and  AF/TE,  for  test  and evaluation ranges). (T1). AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   31  3.1.11.2.  CRP Format.   Each plan will include  an executive summary, state the ROA’s intent/vision,  describe  the  current  situation,  assess  the  ten  range  investment  areas,  and formulate a strategy to address assigned user requirements. 3.1.11.2.1.  Vision.  In this section, identify future capabilities and priorities directed by higher level plans anticipated to accommodate changing missions, modified tactics and  new  weapons  systems.  This  section  should  include  a  statement  of  the  ROA’s intent for the future of the range. Specific thrusts will be captured and organized into overarching goals. 3.1.11.2.2.  Situation.    In  this  section,  describe  the  current  state  of  the  ranges  and airspace  and  any  funded  improvements.  Provide  a  brief  summary  of  utilization  and maintenance  status,  list  major  strengths  and  major  obstacles  to  accomplishing  the assigned mission. This discussion will conclude with an overall analysis of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. 3.1.11.2.3.  Range  Investment  Area  Analysis.    The  main  body  of  the  plan  is  written for  the  technical  person  and  analyzes  each  investment  area  to  identify  strengths, weaknesses,  and  capability  shortfalls.    The  investment  area  analysis  should  validate requirements in support of the ROA’s intent/vision for the range.  It culminates in a time-phased  strategy  that  identifies  specific  range  objectives  that  can  be  used  to justify  investments  both  in  the  annual  budgeting  process  and  to  support  resource programming  across  the  FYDP.    Over  time,  strategy  execution  will  be  measured against the plan and documented in subsequent revisions to the CRP. 3.1.11.2.3.1.  Land.    This  investment  area  includes  all  surface  land  and  water areas required for the range that the military owns, leases or controls by easement. It  also  includes  land  or  water  areas  surrounding  the  range  or  underlying  Special Use Airspace (SUA) that may be affected by range use. 3.1.11.2.3.2.  Airspace.  This investment area addresses all airspace controlled by the  ROA.    Airspace  considerations  include  proximity  to  user  airfields,  airspace volume  and  attributes  and  the  utilization  as  a  function  of  time.  Other considerations  include  FAA  operating  relationships  and  interface  with  the National Airspace System (NAS). 3.1.11.2.3.3.  Environmental.  This investment area includes natural infrastructure on the range and its short- and long-term effect on the military value of the range. Management  practices  and  implementation  of  applicable  regulations  and  policy are included when they interface with military operations. 3.1.11.2.3.4.  Unexploded  Ordnance/Range  Debris. investment  area addresses  the  management  of  Material  Potentially  Presenting  an  Explosive Hazard  (MPPEH)  and  other  range  debris  on  operational  ranges.  It  includes  a program to remove such material and maintain records of use and removal IAW AFMAN 33-363. Also included are efforts to reduce levels of debris and enhance clearance practices.   This 3.1.11.2.3.5.  Physical  Plant.    This  investment  area  involves  infrastructure requirements  primarily  dealing  with  Civil  Engineering  and the construction, upgrade and maintenance of facilities, roads, land, and utilities such includes   32  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 as water, power, gas, sewage, and drainage. 3.1.11.2.3.6.  Scoring and Feedback Systems.  This investment area includes Air-to-Surface scoring systems, air combat mission record and replay capabilities, and Electronic  Attack  (EA)  analysis  systems  for  feedback.  It  also  includes  the specialized  measurement,  tracking  and  analysis  systems  required  to  support  test activities. 3.1.11.2.3.7.  Communications  Systems.    This  investment  area  includes  Ground-Air  and  point-to-point  systems  and  support  on  the  ranges  and  communications backbones  such  as  microwave  and  fiber  systems.  Also  covered  are  information protection requirements (such as encryption), spectrum bandwidth considerations, and radio, data link, and instrumentation frequency management. 3.1.11.2.3.8.  Integrated  Air  Defense/Counter-air  Defense  Systems.   This investment  area  covers  types  and  quantities  of  EW  equipment,  Information Warfare  and  Information  Operations  assets,  Command  and  Control  of  EW systems  (i.e.,  an  Integrated  Air  Defense  System  (IADS)),  jamming  systems (Global  Positioning  System  (GPS),  data  link,  communication/noise),  Space Warfare  and  Low  Observable  resources,  and  the  uses  of  expendables  (chaff  and flares) and towed decoys. 3.1.11.2.3.9.  Targets  and  Target  Arrays.    This  investment  area  addresses  the types and quantities of surface (low, medium and high fidelity) and aerial targets including  realistic  threat  shells,  conventional,  strafe,  urban  warfare,  and  buried targets in  configurations for covered, concealed, deceived, hardened, mobile and remote-controlled / towed moving targets.   This investment  area  addresses  overarching 3.1.11.2.3.10.  Management. systemic  or institutional  practices  and  generally  covers  procedures  and administration. This area includes such activities as programming and supervision as  well  as  scheduling  issues,  the  modernization  planning  process,  and  reducing duplication of effort among the  ranges. Also included are  range functions not  in the other investment areas such as mission control and control/scheduling centers, safety,  noise  management  and  public  affairs,  and  management  of  the  range’s encroachment and sustainability programs. 3.1.11.2.4.  Strategy.  This section will provide the specific actions to attain the ROAs vision and over-arching  goals.  The investment  area analysis should identify specific objectives  supporting  the  goals.  This  section  will  include  an  approach  for accomplishing and overseeing progress. 3.1.11.2.5.  CRP Supporting Documents.  The CRP is linked to numerous specialized documents.    It  is  vital  that  these  supporting  documents  be  readily  available  and preserved for the life of the range. All referenced documents will be maintained in a document management system available to all range staff and available electronically. (T2).  CE is responsible for maintaining all records related to land/water area deeds, leases,  permits,  easements,  etc.  Graphical  data  sets  used  to  produce  graphics  and support  analyses  will  be  preserved  and  continuously  updated  in  a  Geographic Information System that is available to all range staff. (T2). AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   33  3.2.  Planning  Tools.  Each  range  will  maintain  documents  and  graphical  information  used  in planning IAW AFMAN 33-363 to ensure that records remain available to range staff. (T2). 3.2.1.  Document Management System.  Documents may be stored and indexed physically or electronically.   If managed electronically, documents  should be made  available to  all range users and supporters through secure means (request/reply or secure access). 3.2.2.  Geographic Information System (GIS).  A GIS creates, analyzes, manages (including maintenance  and  storage),  and  presents  data  with  a  geographic  reference  to  a  physical location  and  time.    It  is  the  geospatial  data  component  of  Comprehensive  Range  Planning and refers to the compilation and consolidation of geospatial data to create maps to support planning  decisions.    AFI  32-10112  defines  the  mapping  requirements  for  the  CIP  and functional mission dataset data layers. 3.2.2.1.  Range  Data  Layers.    Data  layers  are  required  in  order  to  perform  analysis  of development  constraints  and  opportunities  across  the  range.    Data  for  current  and proposed mission requirements are used to establish limitations and conditions affecting the  range’s  abilities  to  execute  and  support  mission  requirements,  e.g.,  target  arrays, emitters, safety footprints, environmental, etc.   Geospatial  data  collected  and  created  in  support  of 3.2.2.2.  Data  Standards. Comprehensive  Range  Planning  must  adhere  to  the  data  standards  of  the  Air  Force Adaptation  of  Spatial  Data  Standards  for  Facilities,  Infrastructure,  and  Environment.  Range  geospatial  data  will  be  maintained  in  this  format,  and  when  practical,  within  the Installation  GI&S  system.    Ranges  that  create  GIS  data  internally  will  ensure  it  is compatible with the CIP and provide a means to backup the range data layer. 3.2.2.3.  Data Maintenance.  Range data stewards will review range functional data layers and/or mission datasets on no less than an annual basis, and will revise when necessary.  Range data stewards will coordinate updates with their Installation GIO.   34  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 Chapter 4 RANGE OPERATIONS AND SAFETY 4.1.  Range  Operations.  Range  operations  will  be  IAW  this  instruction,  AFI  13-201,  AFI  11-214,  AFMAN  91-201,  Technical  Order  (T.O.)  1-1M-34,  Aircrew  Weapons  Delivery  Manual, T.O.  1-1M-34-1,  Aircrew  Weapons  Delivery  Manual  (classified),  aircraft  specific  weapons delivery  T.O.s,  aircraft  specific  AFI  11-2MDS  series,  and  United  States  Air  Force  Weapons School  (USAFWS)  instructional  texts.  (T1).    For  operations  involving  ground  weapons,  range operators should consult AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program (as applicable); weapons system T.O.s; test-specific procedures, and/or specific SDZ profiles for types of operations and weapons used.  Additional operating restrictions during range clearance and maintenance are contained in paragraph 6.5. 4.2.  Written  Agreements  for  AF-Operated  Ranges.  AFI  25-201  details  the  required procedures  for  entering  into  written  agreements.    ROAs  should  closely  coordinate  with  the MAJCOM any time the range is agreeing to provide support to an unassigned range user.  DoDD 3200.11 and AFI 99-103 address the written agreements and documentation for test support.  The ROA will ensure that all written agreements are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363. (T1).  All agreements pertinent to their range should be readily available to range personnel and users. 4.2.1.  Types of Written Agreements. 4.2.1.1.  Support Agreement (DD Form 1144).  IAW AFI 25-201, a DD Form 1144 will be  used  to  document  recurring  reimbursable  support  where  the  AF  is  the  supplier. (Tiering IAW cited publication).  The ROA, in coordination with the MAJCOM, shall complete  an  Inter-Service  Support  Agreement  (ISSA)  when  providing  training  support for any non-AF user more than 12 days per calendar year or supporting the recurring use by another service is a significant portion of range utilization. (T1). 4.2.1.1.1.  Ranges may entertain requests and discuss user requirements with any non-AF user, but the ROA will coordinate and receive approval from the MAJCOM prior to  entering  into  any  agreement  for  support  of  non-AF  training  events  that  require commitment of additional resources. (T2). 4.2.1.1.2.  Written  support  agreements  are  not  required  for  occasional/limited  use  or during AF-sponsored exercises, deployments, evaluations, or inspections. 4.2.1.2.  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU).    A  MOU  defines  general  areas  of understanding  between  two  or  more  parties,  when  reimbursement  is  not  required.    It neither  includes  commitment  of  resources  nor  binds  a  party  to  a  specific  action.  Individual  units  normally  author  these  MOUs  and  coordinate  them  with  the  parent MAJCOM.  MAJCOM/JA and the State Department Mission in the host country review these MOUs for legal implications. 4.2.1.3.  Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).  A MOA documents the specific terms and responsibilities that two or more parties agree to in writing, especially those that involve reimbursement  or  financial  obligations  (but  without  the  recurring  requirement  which drives a DD Form 1144).  It includes either a commitment of resources or binds a party to AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   35  a specific action.  Individual units normally author these MOAs and coordinate them with the parent MAJCOM.  MAJCOM/FM, JA, and the State Department Mission in the host country review these MOAs for legal and financial implications. 4.2.2.  Written  Agreements  for  Test  and  Evaluation  Activities.    AFI  99-103  details  the extensive  documentation  processes  required  for  test  and  evaluation  activities.    MRTFB ranges may enter into written agreements via formal documentation and coordination at the ROA level. 4.2.3.  Foreign  User  Training  Support  Agreements.    Foreign  users  will  submit  written requests for range support through appropriate country offices within SAF/IA to AF/A3OJR.  AF/A3OJR will coordinate with the appropriate MAJCOM to determine the level of support and  to  integrate  the  support  requirement  into  the  range  mission.    The  MAJCOM  will  then task the ROA to develop the agreement resulting in an MOU or MOA between the range and appropriate  foreign  authority.    These  agreements  may  also  include  specific  Letters  of Agreement  (LOA),  a  Host-Tenant  Support  Agreement  (HTSA),  other  support  agreements detailed  on  a  DD  Form  1144  and/or  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS)  Letter  of  Offer  and Acceptance.  Each signatory ensures that these agreements meet the needs of the organization without compromising the mission and without obligating the organization beyond its intent or  authority.    ROAs  will  coordinate  the  draft  agreement  with  the  Office  of  the  Staff  Judge Advocate.  (T1).    If  a  conflict  arises  regarding  one  of  these  agreements,  the  ROA  should resolve the issue at the appropriate level. 4.3.  Joint Use of Ranges.  Joint Use will be established by the appropriate written agreement(s), license,  contract  or  other  written  test  documentation  between  the  ROA  or  test  authority  (in coordination  with  the  MAJCOM)  and  joint  user  IAW  AFI  25-201  or  test  instructions.    All written  agreements  should  ensure  the  ROA  can  terminate  user  activities  detrimental  to  the range’s natural, cultural, or physical infrastructure and obtain compensation or redress. 4.4.  Shared Use of Ranges. 4.4.1.  Shared  Use  for  Test  and  Training  Activities.    ROAs  will  address  user  requirements and  scheduling  to  develop  a  priority  policy.  (T3).    In  many  instances,  a  written  agreement between the range scheduling office and assigned range users may be appropriate. 4.4.1.1.  10  U.S.C.  §  2681  authorizes  the  use  of  MRTFB  resources  by  commercial entities.    DoDD  3200.11  and  DoDI  3200.18  provide  the  guidance  for  these  activities.  Commercial  activities  on  any  range  must  not  compromise  public  safety,  detract  from mission  accomplishment,  nor  impair  range  operations  or  scheduling  in  any  way.  Prioritization  of  MRTFB  assets  for  commercial  use  is  outlined  in  governing  directives and is generally made available only on a non-interference basis. 4.4.1.2.  PTRs  are  not  designed  or  structured  to  accommodate  test  and  evaluation activities  as  defined  in  AFI  99-103.    Should  use  of  a  PTR  be  necessary  for  test  and evaluation activities, that cannot be accommodated by the MRTFB, all applicable test and evaluation  governing  directives,  instructions,  safety  and  risk  management  procedures, necessary range enhancements, training, additional personnel or upgrades required for the activity will be accomplished and complied with at the cost to the proponent.  In addition, approval by the parent MAJCOM is required.   36  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 4.4.1.3.  In  accordance  with  DoDD  3200.11,  the  MRTFB  may  be  used  by  other  DoD users, including DoD training users.  MRTFB funding policy is defined in DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 11A, Chapter 12 and AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures. 4.4.2.  Shared Use for Activities other than Test and Training.  Shared use of range land with non-DoD  users  is  encouraged  when  it  will  not  compromise  public  safety,  detract  from mission accomplishment, or impair range operations.  IAW AFMAN 91-201, public access is prohibited  in  areas  known  or  suspected  to  contain  UXO  or  other  munitions  that  have experienced  abnormal  environments.  (Tiering  IAW  cited  publication).    Requirements  in paragraphs  4.5.2  and  4.5.3  also  apply.    All  visitors  granted  access  to  the  range  must  be briefed on range safety IAW paragraph 4.17.4.4.  Shared Use may be characterized as either Concurrent  Shared  Use  or  Non-Concurrent  Shared  Use.    AFI  13-201  provides  guidance  on use of DoD airspace. 4.4.2.1.  Concurrent  Shared  Use.    Civil  activities  may  occur  concurrently  with  range operations  provided  human  access  is  prohibited  in  the  Hazard  Area  during  operations.  Agriculture,  grazing  and  timber  management  are  examples  of  activities  that  are conducive to concurrent shared use.  The ROA will determine suitability of all concurrent shared use programs. (T2). 4.4.2.1.1.  Grazing  Programs  can  be  a  complementary  activity  on  USAF  ranges.  Grazing programs will be conducted IAW AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resource Management.  Grazing programs  on Department  of the  Interior lands withdrawn for USAF  use  are  generally  the  responsibility  of  the  Bureau  of  Land  Management (BLM).  An INRMP must be prepared for all ranges addressing all issues associated with natural resources. 4.4.2.1.2.  Other  Commercial  Activities.    Air  Force  ranges  may  also  offer  other commercial  uses  such  as  timber  management,  agricultural  out-leasing,  and  mining.  Again,  many  of  these  programs  are  generally  the  responsibility  of  the  BLM.    The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management of the Department of Interior manages the oil and  gas  exploration  on  the  outer  continental  shelf  applicable  to  USAF  over-water ranges. 4.4.2.2.  Non-Concurrent Shared Use.  Civil use of range land may be allowed within the Hazard  Area  (exclusive  of  areas  known  or  suspected  to  contain  UXO)  IAW  with paragraph 4.5.3.  Recreation and education programs are often compatible because many ranges encompass large airspace, land, or water areas and may contain significant natural resources, wild areas, historical sites, or archaeological sites. As custodian of this public property,  the  USAF  has  the  responsibility  to  maintain  it  in  the  best  manner  possible consistent  with  the  military  mission.  The  INRMP  will  outline  public  access  to  natural resources. This plan is prepared in cooperation with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the  state  fish  and  game  agency.  Additionally,  the  Cultural  Resources  Management  Plan will manage and preserve sensitive areas while addressing public concerns. 4.4.2.3.  Enhanced  Use  Leases.    Normally  Air  Force  ranges  will  not  be  used  for  EULs.  However,  the  ROA  may  deem  a  EUL  compatible  with  range  activity  on  a  case-by-case basis,  provided  it  will  not  adversely  impact  range  capability  (to  include  MRTFB capabilities).  The ROA must work closely with the respective installation commander to AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   37  ensure  any  proceeds  generated  from  the  EUL  are  used  to  sustain  and/or  improve  the range  capability.    The  use  of  EUL  proceeds  generated  by  a  lease  on  Air  Force  range property,  which  are  not  used  to  sustain  and/or  improve  range  capability,  must  be submitted to AF/A3OJR for approval prior to obligation of the proceeds. (T1). 4.5.  Range Access.  MAJCOMs and ROAs will develop procedures for permitting/deconflicting ground  party  and  non-military  activities  on  the  range.  (T1).  Note:  Where  the  terms  Essential Personnel,  and  Mission  Essential  Personnel  are  used  below,  reference  the  “Terms”  section  in Attachment 1 of this instruction. 4.5.1.  Warning Signs.  In addition to the installation warning signs required by AFI 31-101, Integrated  Defense  (FOUO),  ROAs  operating  ranges  under  their  direct  control  will  post safety  warning  signs  (multi-lingual  where  appropriate)  on  the  boundaries.  (T1).    Refer  to Chapter  29  of  AFI  91-203,  Air  Force  Consolidated  Occupational  Safety  Instruction,  for sizing  and  general  design  criteria.    Where  practical,  signs  should  include  both  text  and pictograms/symbols  describing  the  hazard.    The  type  of  sign  (i.e.,  “Danger”  or  “Warning”) will  be  selected  based  on  the  degree  of  hazard  associated  with  range  activities.    Ranges conducting laser operations shall also post laser warning signs utilizing the signage guidance in MIL-HDBK 828B, Range Laser Safety. (T1).  For ranges located on another service’s/host nation’s  property,  and  where  another  agency  is  responsible  for  range  access,  security  and signage,  the  ROA  may  apply  that  service/nation’s  rules,  specified  text,  graphics,  or procedures.  Signs required by this section shall be placed along the boundaries: 4.5.1.1.  Where crossed by roads, paths, trails, streams, streambeds or railways. 4.5.1.2.  At  200m  intervals  where  roads,  paths,  trails  or  railways  parallel  the  range boundary within 500m. 4.5.1.3.  At 1000m intervals in other readily accessible areas not included above.  Note: Signs  are  not  required  in  areas  that  are  not  readily  accessible  on  foot  or  with  wheeled vehicles (e.g., mountainous terrain, swamps, lakes, etc.). 4.5.2.  Impact Areas.  The Impact Area is that area on a range immediately surrounding the target(s) or desired point(s) of impact  (DPI) approved for actual ordnance delivery.  Public access to Impact Areas is prohibited at all times.  When range Impact Area(s) specific DPIs are not in use, access will be limited to Essential Personnel.  The Impact  Area demarcation will be determined locally using RM analysis IAW paragraph 4.18, but should normally be no less than either a) 500 feet from the center of a target or DPI approved for live ordnance, or b) 300 feet from the center of a target or DPI used solely for inert or practice ordnance. 4.5.3.  Hazard Areas.  The Hazard Area is a composite of all Weapon Danger Zones (WDZs), Surface Danger Zones (SDZs), Laser Surface Danger Zones (LSDZs), and Directed Energy Weapon Danger Zones (DEWDZs) for all authorized weapon delivery events, and represents operational hazards as well as residual hazards following munitions deliveries.  Hazard Areas may be segmented based upon the targets, weapons, tactics, maintenance or clearance being utilized  or  conducted  at  a  given  time.    If  Hazard  Areas  are  segmented,  ROAs  will  ensure segment borders are readily identifiable by ground personnel.  Access during operations into the Hazard Area is limited to Mission Essential Personnel, unless specifically authorized by the ROA.  The ROA shall ensure that personnel accessing a LSDZ or DEWDZ have received applicable laser/DEW safety training and wear the appropriate personal protective equipment   38  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 (PPE).  (T2).    Routine  access  to  Hazard  Areas  not  in  use  should  be  limited  to  Essential Personnel.    Public  access  to  Hazard  Areas  is  prohibited  until  all  ordnance  employed  in  the applicable portion of the Hazard  Area is  accounted for and appropriate  remediation actions (i.e., decontamination and RM analysis) have been conducted.  Access to Hazard Areas will be determined locally based on an RM analysis per paragraph 4.18.  On ranges where another agency  controls  Hazard  Area  access,  the  ROA  will  establish  procedures  to  verify  access control and inform that agency of potential hazards. (T2). 4.5.3.1.  Weapon Danger Zone (WDZ).  The WDZ encompasses the ground and airspace for  lateral  and  vertical  containment  of  a  user-determined  percentage  of  projectiles, fragments, debris, and components resulting from the firing, launching, and/or detonation of  aviation  delivered  ordnance.    This  three-dimensional  zone  accounts  for  weapon accuracy,  failures,  ricochets,  and  broaches  (resurfacing)  of  a  specific  weapon/munitions type  delivered  by  a  specific  aircraft  type  under  planned  specific  delivery  release parameters. 4.5.3.2.  Surface  Danger  Zone  (SDZ).    The  ground  and  airspace  designated  for  vertical and lateral containment of a percentage of projectiles, fragments, debris, and components resulting  from  the  firing,  launching,  or  detonation  of  weapon  systems  to  include explosives and demolitions.  See the US Army’s Range Manager’s Toolkit Software for specific SDZ information. 4.5.3.3.  Laser Surface Danger Zone (LSDZ) and Directed Energy Weapon Danger Zone (DEWDZ).  The ground area where laser radiation or directed energy levels may exceed maximum permissible exposure levels thereby requiring controls.  In addition, a DEWDZ may  include  proximity  restrictions  to  the  testing  or  employment  of  DEWs  with  or  in vicinity of conventional munitions to prevent inadvertent functioning or damage.  Active LSDZs or DEWDZs become part of the Hazard Area while such equipment is in use. 4.5.4.  Observation  Posts  (OPs).    Notwithstanding  paragraphs  4.5.2,  4.5.3,  and  4.11.6,  OPs within a hazard area may be used by Tactical Air Control Parties (TACP), JTACs, or other briefed  personnel  involved  in  Close  Air  Support  (CAS)/air-to-ground  training,  consistent with the following criteria: 4.5.4.1.  ROAs will conduct a risk assessment of the proposed OP or maneuver area prior to approving their use. (T1). 4.5.4.2.  Personnel  within  the  Hazard  Area  must  remain  outside  the  Minimum  Safe Distance (MSD) for Ground Parties (Training Use Only: Live Fire) published in AFTTP 3-2.6,  JFIRE  Multi-Service  Tactics,  Techniques  and  Procedures  for  the  Application  of Firepower.   IAW AFI 11-214, if the planned operations/deliveries are inconsistent with the assumptions used to derive the MSD values, personnel must remain outside the WDZ. (T1). 4.5.4.3.  If there is no published MSD for the weapon or aircraft, submit requests to the ACC  Weapons  and  Tactics  office  (ACC/A3TW)  for  review  and  approval.    Personnel shall not be allowed inside the WDZ unless such approval is granted. (T1). 4.5.4.4.  While inside the Hazard Area, all personnel will wear protective gear IAW AFI 11-214 and AFI 13-112V1, Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) Training Program. (T1). AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   39  4.6.  Radio  Frequency  Spectrum  Issues.  ROAs  will  identify  the  Radio  Frequency  (RF) spectrum  required  for  range  operation  and  coordinate  requirements  with  the  appropriate Installation Spectrum Manager (ISM). (T1).  The ROA will ensure that a frequency assignment has  been  obtained  by  the  user  (or  appropriate  Spectrum  Management  Office  supporting  the user’s RF requirements) prior to using any RF emitting equipment. (T1). 4.7.  Communications  Requirements.  The  ROA  will  submit  all  normal  communications capability  requirements  to  the  supporting  wing  communications  function.  (T2).    Test-specific systems on ranges under the MRTFB may be obtained by local acquisition methods. 4.7.1.  Ranges  providing  Class  A,  B  and  C  services  will  have  reliable  point-to-point communications with the parent or using base and manned sites on the range.  (T2).  During Class A service, the range control tower will have redundant communications capability with the flank tower(s) and operations building(s). (T2).  All parties or individuals must maintain two-way  voice  contact  with  the  main  tower,  range  office,  and/or  parent  base  while  in  the Hazard Area. (T1).  Portable or mobile radios may be used for backup communications and to maintain contact with personnel in the Hazard Area. 4.7.2.  Ranges  providing  Class  A,  B  and  C  services  will  have  ground-to-air  radios  to communicate with aircraft on the range. (T2).  Primary systems will normally be ultra-high frequency  (UHF)  radios,  but  very  high  frequency  (VHF),  or  frequency  modulation  (FM) radios are authorized at ranges where users are similarly equipped.  Provision of dual, multi-band  radios  should  be  considered  to  maximize  mission  flexibility  and  safety  monitoring capability. 4.7.2.1.  When  a  range  provides  Class  A  service,  the  RCO  is  responsible  for  all  range operations  and  air/ground  safety,  except  in  cases  where  weapons  release  clearance  is delegated.  The RCO must maintain continuous radio communication with all aircraft and ground  personnel  on  the  range  and  will  have  a  backup,  independent  radio.  (T2).    The RCO  must  remain  in  either  the  main  or  flank  tower  (or  another  MAJCOM  approved location) while providing Class A service. (T2). 4.7.2.2.  During  Class  B  service,  ranges  must  have  the  capability  to  communicate  with the aircraft to provide scores. (T2). 4.7.2.3.  During  Class  A  and  B  service,  all  UHF,  VHF,  FM  and  Land  Mobile  Radios (LMR) voice frequencies being used on range will be recorded at all times. (T2). 4.7.2.4.  The  RCO  will  ensure  that  all  recorders  are  working  properly.    Each  recording will  contain  the  range  name,  date,  and  time.    Recordings  will  be  maintained  for  a minimum of 7 days.  In addition, recordings containing records of any range incident will be kept and secured until released by the investigating agency. (T3). 4.7.2.5.  All aircraft utilizing the range will monitor Guard frequency. (T0). 4.7.2.6.  Aircraft using UHF, VHF, or FM radios on the range will utilize range assigned UHF, VHF, or FM frequencies. (T1). 4.7.3.  Ranges  providing  Class  D  service  where  operations  are  monitored  by  a  RTO  should have  ground-to-air  radios  to  communicate  with  aircraft  on  the  range  and  network connectivity  to  ground  instrumentation  receivers  when  live-monitoring  of  the  mission  is required.   40  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 4.7.4.  Communication  Operations.   Range  personnel  will  normally  operate  all communications  equipment  used  on  range.    Assign  communications  personnel  as  radio operators only when special conditions warrant. 4.8.  Armament  Safety  Procedures.  For ranges capable of aircraft ordnance delivery, prior to first  release  when  carrying  expendable  ordnance  (live,  inert,  or  practice),  final  switch configuration for weapon release will not be accomplished until the aircraft is in such a position that  any  accidental  release  will  be  contained  within  the  range.  (T1).    MAJCOMs  will  develop specific  guidance  for  armament  system  configurations  for  multiple  passes.    After  completing final weapons delivery, each flight member will perform  a weapons system safety check.  (T1).  Refer to AFI 11-214, aircraft specific AFI 11-2MDS series operating procedures, and individual range supplements for additional guidance. 4.9.  Weapons  Release  Authority.  Acceptance  of  weapons  release  authority  incurs  sole responsibility for the safe release of ordnance. 4.9.1.  Terminology  Conventions.    To  prevent  miscommunication,  the  term  “cleared”  will only  be  used  when  authorizing  weapons  release.  (T0).    For  all  other  matters,  “approved”, “authorized” or any term other than “cleared” will be used.  The term “continue” will be used in the manner described in Joint Publication (JP) 3-09.3, Close Air Support, to acknowledge requests  or  indicate  approval  to  proceed  with  an  attack  profile  or  action  without  providing clearance to release any ordnance yet. (T0). 4.9.2.  On  ranges  providing  Class  A  service,  weapons  release  authority  resides  inherently with the RCO.  For each pass, the RCO will authorize weapons release with a “cleared hot” radio call unless release authority has been delegated. (T1).  The RCO may delegate weapons release authority to a qualified flight lead, individual pilot, Forward Air Controller-Airborne (FAC[A]),  JTAC  or  other  briefed  person  by  issuing  an  “Authorized  (flight  lead,  individual pilot, FAC[A], JTAC, etc.) Control” radio call.  The RCO, who will remain in either the main or flank tower (or another MAJCOM approved location), retains overall range authority at all times and can withdraw release clearance or abort a release at any time. (T2). 4.9.3.  On  ranges  providing  Class  B  and  C  service,  weapons  release  authority  devolves hierarchically to the JTAC, FAC(A), flight lead, individual pilot or other briefed person who may then delegate the authority as desired. 4.10.  Simulated Weapons Release Authority.  Except during flight-lead or individual control, to emulate the clearance procedures contained in JP 3-09.3, the weapons release authority should issue a “continue dry” radio call to signify authority to simulate weapons release. 4.11.  Weapons Employment and Airdrop Operations. 4.11.1.  Do  not  employ  weapons  outside  approved  DoD  SUA.  (T0).    Note:  Research  and T&E  activities  do  not  require  SUA  if  conducted  IAW  AFI  99-103,  provided  appropriate coordination and approvals are obtained from FAA/spectrum authorities as required. 4.11.2.  The  land  or  sea  underlying  the  Hazard  Area  or  failure  footprint  used  for  actual weapon  employment  must  be  protected  by  purchase,  lease,  or  other  means  to  ensure  the safety  of  personnel,  structures,  and  the  public  from  expended  weapons,  laser  and electromagnetic emissions, and target debris. (T0). AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   41  4.11.2.1.  For events where the weapons footprint will fall outside the lateral confines of the  established  rangeland,  the  ROA  will  notify  the  public  and  will  conduct  a  risk assessment and take actions to minimize the hazard to the public and non-DoD property. (T1). 4.11.2.2.  ROAs  at  test  ranges  will  ensure  a  Flight  Termination  System  (FTS)  or  other containment  measures  are  applied  to  aerial  test  items  (weapons,  missiles,  UASs,  etc.) having the potential to exceed range boundaries and endanger public or DoD assets and personnel.    ROAs  will  establish  a  method  of  determining  the  position  of  the  item  in relation  to  its  footprint/range  boundary  and  assess  the  need  for  redundancy  of  position information, telemetry, and FTS signal transmission based on the potential hazard. (T1). 4.11.3.  Except  as  noted  below,  ROAs  will  prohibit  weapons  employment  unless  an applicable SDZ/WDZ footprint or test footprint has been applied to the target for the specific delivery platform, weapon and employment parameters. (T1).  ROAs may expedite analysis by  grouping  targets  together  or  combining  aircraft  type,  weapon  type,  and  tactics,  as appropriate.  Test  footprints  are  not  authorized  for  training  missions,  nor  are  applicable training footprints, by themselves, sufficient for test missions, but training footprints may be used as part of the ROA’s overall risk assessment. 4.11.3.1.  Where containment is  software selectable, ROAs will apply  WDZs  and SDZs that provide the following containment of projectiles, fragments, debris and components as a minimum: (T1). 4.11.3.1.1.  Surface  fires:  99.9999%  (Expressed  as  1:1,000,000  escapement  for SDZs). 4.11.3.1.2.  Aviation-delivered gun ammunition: 99.999%. 4.11.3.1.3.  All other aviation-delivered ordnance: 99.99%. 4.11.3.2.  MRTFB and Test Range ROAs are responsible for ensuring test footprints are developed  and  applied  for  test  missions.    If  the  application  of  test  footprints  would preclude  the  accomplishment  of  test  objectives,  the  ROA,  in  conjunction  with  the  AFI 99-103 Safety Review may authorize the use of a risk management policy. The ROA will perform, and the Safety Review must validate, a risk assessment to identify and minimize hazards consistent with test objectives (see AFI 99-103). (T1). 4.11.4.  The  WDZ  Tool  is  a  multi-service  safety  tool  that  helps  the  ROA  conduct  safe training  range  operations.    The  tool  creates  probabilistic  weapons  impact  footprints  by defining  aircraft-delivered WDZs per paragraph  4.5.3.1.  The WDZ tool  software identifies weapons impact point probabilities from a variety of platforms and parameters, providing an analytical foundation for sound and objective range planning and execution decision-making. 4.11.4.1.  WDZ Tool Methodology.  The WDZ tool application methodology allows the ROA  to  identify  possible  target  locations,  modify  allowable  delivery  ground  tracks  to eliminate or reduce hazards, identify the best location for range improvements, or design a new Impact Area/range.  The methodology is based on WDZ footprints developed from a combination of actual weapon impact data and simulation results.  A WDZ defines the minimum  land  required  to  employ  a  given  munition  safely,  using  a  certain  aircraft  and delivery  tactic,  over  a  specific  soil  density  and  target  type.    Each  WDZ  footprint   42  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 incorporates  a  probability  distribution  function  (PDF),  which  provides  the  information necessary  to  perform  a  quantitative  risk  assessment  and  evaluate  the  relative  risk  of  an identified hazard. 4.11.4.2.  Procuring  WDZ  Footprints.    HQ  ACC/A3A  is  the  lead  USAF  agent  for procuring and modifying WDZ footprints  for CAF requirements.  MAJCOMs requiring unique  or  fast-track  WDZ  footprints  will  fund  their  respective  requirements  and  will coordinate  with  ACC/A3A  at  least  6  months  prior  to  the  need  date.    Foreign  countries will  coordinate  WDZ  acquisition  through  the  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS)  Case  and submit a Letter of Request (LOR) to the US Navy International Program Office through their  respective  embassy  at  least  nine  months  prior  to  the  need  date.    Embassies  must email  the  LORs  in  PDF  format  to  navyipolors@navy.mil.    Foreign  participants  in exercises  conducted  on  AF  ranges  must  provide  WDZ  procurement  information  to  the appropriate exercise coordination function during the exercise planning process. 4.11.4.3.  For  allies/foreign  countries  using  same  type  US  aircraft  and  US  weapons, ROAs  may  use  a  US  aircraft  WDZ  in  their  RM  assessment.  Notify  the  MAJCOM  and AF/A3OJR  of  the  use  of  this  applicable  WDZ  prior  to  actual  employment.  ROAs  may also  apply  a  larger  buffer,  for  risk  mitigation  purposes,  if  the  ally  is  not  a  routine participant  and  unfamiliar  with  the  range  and  exercise/training  scenario.  For  unique foreign  aircraft  and  weapons  which  are  not  in  the  US  inventory  refer  to  paragraph 4.11.4.2. 4.11.5.  Precautions  with  Expendable  Munitions.    Aircraft  with  free-falling  and/or  forward-firing ordnance will not over fly or point their guns at manned sites with intent to expend or employ weapons.  Aircraft with  moveable guns, such as helicopters and AC-130 Gunships, will not point their guns at any manned site.  Facilities where the risk of damage is deemed unacceptable must not be within any footprint. 4.11.6.  Weapons Employment near Manned Equipment, Facilities and Sites. 4.11.6.1.  Training.    In  general,  manned  equipment,  facilities  and  sites,  such  as  range towers,  simulated  threat  emitter  systems,  and  OPs,  may  be  located  within  the  Hazard Area during range operations, provided the associated personnel  are designated mission essential, inert ordnance is used, and a risk assessment is conducted and approved by the ROA  IAW  paragraph  4.18.    See  also  paragraph  4.5.4  for  additional  criteria  associated with OPs. 4.11.6.2.  Test.  The presence of manned equipment, facilities and sites must be addressed in the risk assessment process described in paragraph 4.11.3.2.  Authorized test activities employing  live  munitions  may  locate  personnel/equipment  (e.g.,  telemetry/recording devices) within the Hazard Area only if essential for mission accomplishment, and only with documented risk management application and approval. 4.11.7.  Improved  Container  Delivery  System  (I-CDS)  and  Joint  Precision  Airdrop  System (JPADS) Deliveries. 4.11.7.1.  ROAs will approve I-CDS and JPADS deliveries only if the Precision Airdrop System-Mission  Planner  (PADS-MP)  derived  footprints  for  success  and  chute  failure overlay only government owned, leased or otherwise controlled land with no non-mission essential personnel present and a Collateral Damage Assessment (CDA) acceptable to the AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   43  ROA has been accomplished.  (T1).  Additional  JPADS/I-CDS  information is  published in AFI 13-217. 4.11.7.2.  If  the  load  will  or  may  transit  non-Restricted  Airspace  during  its  fall  (e.g., footprints are not wholly contained within restricted airspace), ROAs will also ensure the user  complies  with  applicable  rules  contained  in  Federal  Aviation  Regulation  105.25. (T0). 4.11.7.3.  Equipment,  facilities  and  mission  essential  personnel  are  permitted  within  the success,  chute failure and the guidance failure footprints if the ROA has conducted and approved a risk assessment IAW paragraph 4.18. 4.11.7.4.  Because  users  utilize  weather  observation  and  dropsonde  (an  expendable, aircraft-launched  weather  measurement  device)  wind  updates  to  revise  their  footprint analyses up until the time of delivery, ROAs should ensure the user is aware of the ROAs exclusion  requirements  and  be  provided  with  the  location  of  airspace/range  boundaries and any personnel or equipment the ROA cannot or chooses not to allow in the footprint as part of his/her risk analysis. 4.12.  Jettison  Areas.  All  ranges  with  aerial  delivery  capability  will  have  an  area  within  the Hazard  Area  designated  for  jettison  of  ordnance  and  stores.    The  location  of  jettison  areas  and jettison procedures will be designed to minimize the hazard to the public, ground personnel and range structures as well as aircraft and aircrew. 4.13.  Electronic  Warfare  Training  Operations.  EW Training Operations facilities provide  a realistic  electronic  threat  environment  for  aircrew  training  through  the  use  of  Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) and Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA) threat emitter simulators.  These facilities also provide  EW  support  for  composite  force  training,  unit  exercises,  unit  gunnery  competitions, normal training missions, and higher HQ exercises or inspections.  To fulfill these requirements, EW  threat  equipment  and  operating  procedures  should  closely  parallel  those  of  the  anticipated enemy threat systems. 4.13.1.  Electronic  Warfare  Sites.    EWSs  are  normally  located  under  or  near  instrumented MTRs, MOAs, and/or  Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace  (ATCAA)  and only require  a small  land  area  for  equipment  location.    An  EWS  has  the  capability  to  provide  mission debriefings detailing individual aircrew or large force analysis/feedback on the effectiveness of EA and threat avoidance procedures. 4.13.2.  Electronic  Warfare  Ranges.    EWRs  are  collocated  with  ranges  (traditionally  those that  support  surface  fires  and  actual  ordnance  delivery).    EWRs  may  or  may  not  have  the capability to provide analysis/feedback on the effectiveness of package or individual aircrew EA and/or threat avoidance procedures, and EW training capability may vary from limited to robust.    EWRs  typically  consist  of  multiple  geographically  separated  threat  emitters coordinated to simulate an IADS.  Mobile emitters are used to provide scenario flexibility. 4.13.3.  Electronic Warfare Personnel Training.  To provide a realistic threat environment for aircrew  combat  training,  EWR/EWS  electronic  threat  operators  will  have  a  working knowledge of EW doctrine and employment concepts. 4.13.3.1.  Training Programs.  Management criteria, administrative practices, and training policies  required  to  conduct  a  comprehensive  EWR/EWS  training  program  will  include   44  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 academics  and  practical  application  in  live  and  simulated  environments.    EWR/EWS personnel should be familiar with applicable MAJCOM training events and requirements defined in AFI 11-2MDSv1s and Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Tasking Messages.   ROAs  are  responsible  for  the  selection  and  written 4.13.3.2.  Responsibilities. designation  of  instructor  personnel  who  will  conduct  site  training  for  government personnel.    The  unit  training  officer/site  manager  is  responsible  for  developing  the  unit training programs, training schedules, quarterly and annual unit training plans, and lesson plans,  and  is  the  unit  approving  authority  for  all  unit-developed  training  courses  or programs.  For contractor run operations, the ROA must ensure the contract contains the minimum training requirements as documented in Attachment 5. 4.13.4.  ROAs will make every effort to provide scores/feedback for requested EW activity.  These shall be documented and delivered in a mutually agreed upon format. 4.14.  Flare  and  Chaff  Employment.  Unless  further  restricted  by  MAJCOM  or  local supplements, flares will be employed IAW AFI 11-214, while chaff will be employed IAW the latest  version  of  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  Manual  (CJCSM)  3212.02,  Performing Electronic  Attack  in  the  United  States  and  Canada  for  Tests,  Training  and  Exercises,  and  AFI 11-2MDS series instructions.  This guidance assumes use of current inventory flares and chaff, a frequency authorization for chaff, and an adequate environmental analysis of the use of flare and chaff.    The  use  of  flare  or  chaff  cartridges  having  significantly  different  characteristics (pyrophoric  flares  or  double  squibbed  chaff)  is  restricted  to  authorized  test  and  evaluation activities until their use is authorized by the appropriate MAJCOM. 4.15.  Global  Positioning  Satellite  Electronic  Attack.  GPS  EA  in  DoD  tests,  training,  and exercises  will  be  employed  IAW  the  latest  version  of  CJCSM  3212.03,  Performing  Tests, Training,  and  Exercises  Impacting  the  Global  Positioning  System,  and  classified  supplement.  These activities require approval from Commander, US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). 4.15.1.  GPS  EA  Requests  and  Approvals.    All  GPS  EA  requests  must  be  officially sanctioned  by  a  DoD  organization  or  authorized  contractor  (under  contract  with  a  DoD organization)  and  conducted  for  DoD  purpose  to  ensure  forces  can  operate  in  an  intense electronic warfare environment. (T0).  Requests must be developed and submitted IAW the procedures established in CJCSM 3212.03. (T0). 4.15.2.  GPS  EA  Employment.    Teams  conducting  these  operations  will  maintain  positive control of GPS jammers. (T0).  For range safety, the ROA will provide the teams operating GPS jamming equipment with a primary and alternate means of communications. (T1). 4.15.2.1.  Ranges  must  provide  dedicated  Cease  Buzzer  telephone  numbers  for  the duration of the GPS EA employment. (T0).  These telephone numbers must be provided with the initial request package.  Any change to Cease Buzzer numbers must be provided to  Air  Force  Spectrum  Management  Office  by  either  the  range  or  the  proponent  in  an updated  request  to  be  forwarded  to  US  Strategic  Command  and  received  by  FAA  HQ NLT than seven days prior to event execution. (T0). 4.15.2.2.  Ranges  must  provide  the  GPS  jamming  teams  with  the  capability  to  monitor guard and range operations channels. (T0). AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   45  4.15.2.3.  Notifications prior to and post GPS EA operations must be made in accordance with  the  GPS  EA  approval  message  from  USSTRATCOM  (and  FAA  or  USCG concurrence messages, if applicable).

(T1). tactics)  and  provide  range-specific 4.16.4.2.  DEW  evaluations  will  be  a  collaborative  effort  between  711  HPW/RHD, AFRL/RD, and any other agency needed to ensure foreseeable health and material safety concerns are considered. (T1). 4.16.5.  Certification  Annual  Reviews.    The  LSO  and/or  DEWSO  will  review  applicable operations  with  the  ROO/ROA  annually  (within  45  days  of  the  certification  report’s   46  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 anniversary) to ensure activities are within the scope of the current range certification. (T2).  If  any  activities  or  physical  changes  to  the  range  are  found  to  be  outside  the  scope,  the affected laser operations will be terminated until they have been evaluated and incorporated into  the  range  certification.  (T1).    Contact  the  711  HPW/RHD  certifying  agency  for assistance.    Note:  the  previous  two  sentences  do  not  apply  to  research  or  T&E  activities, provided  the  conditions  in  paragraph  4.16.3.1  have  been  met.    Report  findings  from  the annual review to the MAJCOM and certifying agency. (T2). 4.16.6.  Certification  Validity.    Certifications  expire  at  the  end  of  the  third  fiscal  year following  issuance  (e.g.,  a  certification  dated  3  December  2006  expires  on  30  September 2010).    Upon  expiration,  the  certification  must  be  re-accomplished  IAW  paragraph  4.16.4 before covered activities may resume. (T2).  Prior to expiration, the certification is valid for the  equipment,  aircraft,  targets,  tactics  and  weapons  evaluated  as  long  as  the  report’s recommendations are complied with, land and airspace boundaries remain unchanged, annual reviews  are  submitted  to  the  MAJCOM  and  certifying  agency  within  45  days  of  the  initial report’s  anniversary,  and  laser  specular  hazards  are  periodically  removed  (as  specified  in paragraph 4.16.8.4).  The reinstatement or extension of a certification will be at the discretion of the AFRL certifying authority based on the scope of changes. 4.16.7.  Laser Clearinghouse (LCH) Coordination.  Use of lasers or laser systems, regardless of classification, that have the potential to propagate above the horizon requires coordination with the US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) LCH in accordance with DoDI 3100.11, Illumination  of  Objects  in  Space  by  Lasers,  and  Chairman  of  the  Joints  Chiefs  of  Staff Instruction  (CJCSI)  3225.01,  Illumination  of  Objects  in  Space  by  Lasers.  (T0).    For information on coordination, contact the LCH at DSN 276-1075/4341 (commercial 805-606-1075/4341).

Lasers  will  not  be  operated  without  the  approval  of  the  LSO  and  the  ROO (RCO during Class A service). (T2). 4.16.8.2.  The user will notify the ROO or RCO upon termination of laser activity.  (T3).  The ROO or RCO will acknowledge termination and will record the start and stop time of range periods when laser operations take place. (T3). 4.16.8.3.  Ground  lasers  will  not  be  directed  at  targets  or  Hazard  Areas  where  the  laser beam  will  terminate  with  an  ocular  hazard  beyond  the  range  boundary  unless  the hazardous laser energy  will exclusively transit Restricted Airspace (or equivalent) up to an  altitude  of  60,000  feet  (Flight  Level  600),  and  terminate  in  space  without  affecting non-participating satellites. (T0). AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   47  4.16.8.4.  Specular hazards will be periodically removed from the LSDZ surrounding the targets; reference guidance in MIL-HDBK-828B as necessary. (T2). 4.16.8.5.  IAW AFI 48-139, the director of Base Medical Services will be notified of the specific  types  of  laser  activities  that  occur  on  the  range  and  medical  surveillance requirements for range personnel (as determined by a qualified medical provider) will be accomplished  before  working  in  a  laser  hazard  environment.  (Tiering  IAW  cited publication). 4.16.8.6.  IAW  AFI  48-139,  all  range  personnel  within  the  Laser  Surface  Danger  Zone (LSDZ)  during  laser  operations  will  wear  laser  eye  protection  of  appropriate  optical density. (Tiering IAW cited publication). 4.16.9.  General Requirements for Non-Laser DEW. 4.16.9.1.  Non-laser  DEW  systems  will  not  be  operated  without  the  approval  of  the DEWSO and the ROO (RCO during Class A Service). (T2). 4.16.9.2.  The user will notify the ROO or RCO upon termination of DEW activity.  The ROO  or  RCO  will  acknowledge  termination  and  will  record  the  start  and  stop  time  of range periods when DEW operations take place. (T3). 4.16.10.  Injury  Reporting.    Report  laser  injuries  IAW  AFI  48-139  and  radio  frequency radiation injuries IAW AFI 48-109, Electromagnetic Field Radiation (EMFR) Occupational and Environmental Health Program. (Tiering IAW cited publications). 4.16.11.  Laser  Weapon,  Device  and  DEW  Certification  on  Foreign  and  Other  US  Service Ranges.  When  USAF aircraft operate on another nation’s/service’s range, MAJCOMs will ensure procedures have been developed and are promulgated by the host nation/service prior to  employing lasers weapons, devices and/or DEW systems.  (T1).   In the event procedures have  not  been  developed,  laser  weapon,  device  and  DEW  operations  will  comply  with  this instruction. (T1). 4.17.  Range Safety. 4.17.1.  Visual  Identification  of  Manned  Equipment,  Facilities  and  Sites.   To  the  maximum extent  possible,  equipment  and  facilities,  manned  or  unmanned,  that  are  not  targets  should include  visual  identification  systems,  such  as  high  contrast  paint  (white  or  orange),  IR strobes,  etc.    White  or  orange  paint  shall  not  be  used  on  any  “bombable”  targets  with  the exception of strafe “rags” or specific test targets where white supports test objectives. (T1). 4.17.2.  Range Demonstrations and Visitor Procedures.  Each ROA must publish or reference procedures in their local range supplement to ensure positive control of all spectators.  (T3).  Visitor  locations  must  be  analyzed  using  the  appropriate  weapons  footprint/hazard  area program to ensure that spectators are not within the hazard area during operations. (T2).  The ROA  will  have  control  in  those  limited  cases  where  DoD  personnel  or  contractors  must  be within the hazard area during operations to accomplish a specific mission-related task. (T2). 4.17.3.  Flight Safety. 4.17.3.1.  Airspace Activation.  The RCO will activate range airspace with the local ATC facility  or  Air  Traffic  representative  IAW  local  agreements  between  the  ROA  and  the controlling agency. (T0).  The request for activation should be timed (before a scheduled   48  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 mission) to allow shared or joint users to clear the area and for the controlling agency to make internal adjustments. 4.17.3.2.  Weather  Observation.    The  RCO  will  monitor  weather  conditions  to  include altimeter  setting,  temperature,  ceiling,  visibility  and  winds.  (T2).    Observations  may  be obtained  from  the  local  base  weather  station,  command  post,  Automated  Weather Observing  System  (AWOS),  or  ATC  agency  at  least  hourly,  if  the  capability  is  not available at the range.  The local weather detachment or command post should advise the RCO of any sudden adverse weather changes that might affect range operations or safety. 4.17.3.3.  Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS).  Where internet connectivity permits, RCOs will utilize AHAS (http://www.usahas.com) to monitor bird movement and bird strike risk levels for the airspace associated with the range. (T2). 4.17.3.4.  Aircraft  Accident  Procedures.    In  case  of  an  aircraft  crash  during  Class  A service,  the  RCO  will  initiate  all  necessary  emergency  actions.  (T1).    These  include appropriate notifications, closing of the range, and assuming responsibility as the interim on-scene  commander  until  the  crash  response  team  can  be  organized.    During  Class  B, Class  C,  and  Class  D  service,  the  flight  lead,  individual  pilot,  FAC(A),  JTAC  or  other briefed  person  will  start  the  emergency  actions,  and  if  feasible,  act  as  the  interim  on   Investigations  will  be  conducted  IAW  AFI  91-204,  Safety scene-commander. Investigations and Reports. 4.17.4.  Ground and Explosive Safety. 4.17.4.1.  Fire  Prevention.  Identify  range  activities  likely  to  cause  range  fires,  and develop  and  implement  procedures  to  mitigate  them.  Identify  a  single  agency  or  office responsible for determining the fire danger hazard level, typically in cooperation with the land  management  agency.  Develop  a  decision  matrix  and  checklist  to  standardize  fire prevention  actions  and  ensure  appropriate  responses  as  fire  conditions  change.  Include fire prevention in the Wildland Fire Management Plan, CRP, and range supplement. (T3). 4.17.4.2.  Fire Suppression Equipment.  On ranges providing Class A or manned Class B or T services, appropriate fire suppression equipment and personnel must be available to deal  with  local  fire  hazards.    This  capability  may  be  provided  through  USAF,  host military  organization  for  tenant  units,  landowner,  in-service  civilian,  independent contractor  assets,  or  through  agreement  with  another  government  agency  such  as  the BLM  or  US  Forest  Service.    The  ROA  in  coordination  with  the  agency/organization providing fire support shall identify the fire suppression equipment requirements and will ensure  that  sufficient  fire  suppression  equipment  is  assigned  directly  to  the  range  for emergency use. (T2). 4.17.4.3.  Emergency Procedures.  Emergency procedures will be readily available to the RCO and other ground personnel, such as JTACS, for use during range operations. 4.17.4.4.  Safety  Briefing  Requirements.    The  ROA  or  contractor  will  provide  and document  initial  and  yearly  ground  and  explosive  safety  briefings  IAW  AFI  91-202,  to personnel assigned to operate and maintain Air Force ranges. (T2).  The ROA will ensure all personnel participating in range clearance operations receive additional training IAW paragraph 6.4.2 before assisting in range clearance. (T2).  The ROA must also ensure that AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   49  authorized  visitors  and  personnel  who  infrequently  visit  the  range  are  appropriately briefed on range safety. (T2). 4.17.4.5.  Hazard Condition Watch.  The RCO and all range personnel must continually watch  for  hazardous  conditions  such  as  trespassers,  fires,  bird  activity  conditions,  etc.  Range  users  will  be  notified  immediately  of  any  hazardous  conditions  on  the  range.    If safety  is  in  question,  the  RCO  or  other  appropriate  authority  will  stop  range  operations until the situation is remedied. (T3). 4.17.4.6.  Performance  during  Critical  Tasks.    During  the  performance  of  critical situational  tasks  such  as  controlling  or  monitoring  the  movement  of  aircraft  or  ground parties using the range, personnel must not conduct unrelated activities which divert their attention,  degrade  situational  awareness  or  prevent  timely  communications.  (T3).    Such distracting  prohibitions  include  composing  and  sending  emails  and  text  messages unrelated  to  the  mission  at  hand,  browsing  web  pages  unrelated  to  the  mission  and making and receiving unofficial phone calls. 4.18.  Risk  Management  Program.  ROA  responsibilities  related  to  RM  are  detailed  in paragraph 2.8.22.  Range operations are complex and the RM process requires a dedicated team representing  multiple  functional  areas  such  as  operations,  CE  (to  include  EOD),  legal,  public affairs, and safety.  Utilize the RM process prior to any change to range operations, boundaries, or  procedures  with  the  potential  to  increase  flight,  ground  or  explosive  safety  risks.    The  RM assessment examines type of ordnance authorized, employment tactics, weapons footprints, type of proposed joint or shared use, geographic features, frequency of EOD sweeps, etc.  Coordinate assessments through the wing (or equivalent) POC for RM matters. 4.19.  Night Operations. 4.19.1.  Aircraft  reduced,  covert  and  blacked-out  lighting  operations  will  not  be  conducted during  Class  A  service  unless  the  RCO  is  equipped  with  binocular,  generation-III  NVDs. (T2).    NVDs  will  be  tested,  adjusted  and  focused  by  the  RCO  before  use  with  (in  order  of preference)  the  Hoffman  ANV-20/20  Tester,  a  unit  eye  lane  or  equivalent  tester.  (T2).  Perform  NVD  testing,  adjustment  and  focusing  procedures  IAW  appropriate  T.O.s  and MAJCOM guidance. (T2). 4.19.2.  Range Lighting. 4.19.2.1.  Class  A  Service  Identification  Lighting.    Ranges  providing  Class  A  services that support night operations must have available a distinctive pattern of lights visible by aircrews, with and without NVDs, to ensure positive orientation and identification of the range  and target  area.  (T2).  These lights  should  be readily identifiable but  not  so as to distract aircrews during weapons delivery or wash out target locations.  ROAs will ensure that no similar pattern of lights exists near the range that could be misidentified as targets or the Impact Area, but cultural lighting inside or outside the range boundary may serve as a portion of the distinctive pattern of lights. (T2). 4.19.2.2.  Class  B  Service  Identification  Lighting.    Ranges  providing  Class  B  services that  support  night  operations  will  have  lighting  as  described  above  unless  the  ROA  has determined that the lighting is not required based on a documented, RM analysis (based on range size, remoteness, etc.) (T2).   50  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 4.19.2.3.  Target Lighting.  Lighting for the specific purpose of illuminating the target is only  required  on  ranges  that  support  users  accomplishing  unaided  visual  deliveries.    If required  (or  desired  by  other  users),  target  lighting  may  be  accomplished  using incandescent lights, lanterns, or flares.  Lights and lanterns should be NVD compatible or reduced  in  intensity  to  produce  the  minimum  halo  around  each  light  when  viewed through  NVDs.    Every  effort  should  be  made  to  prevent  the  target  from  appearing  as  a light with a halo to allow positive target identification. 4.19.2.4.  Range Facility Identification. 4.19.2.4.1.  Range  Tower  and  Routinely-Manned  Facility  Lighting.    Lighting  is required  on  all  routinely-manned  range  facilities  and  range  towers  to  facilitate positive  identification  by  aircrew.  (T2).    Proper  management  of  tower  lighting  is important  to  maximize  performance  of  NVDs  used  by  range  personnel.    Tower lighting  (interior  and  exterior)  should  be  minimized  to  those  necessary  to  conduct operations  and  all  unnecessary  lights  should  be  extinguished  or  taped  over.    NVD compatible  lighting  is  highly  recommended.    Consider  moving  tower,  routinely-manned facility and obstruction strobe lights to locations that will best support night operations. 4.19.2.4.2.  Other  Manned  Locations.    Other  manned  locations  (such  as  OPs,  visitor locations,  vehicles,  etc.)  will,  as  a  minimum,  mark  their  location  by  any  means described in JP 3-09.3 for “friendly marking” that facilitates positive identification by aircrew. (T0). 4.19.3.  IR  Pointers  and/or  Lasers.    A  single,  steady  IR  pointer  will  not  be  used  as  the  sole means of target identification. (T1).  If using an IR pointer to mark targets, either the target or  friendly  terminus  of  the  pointer  must  be  positively  verified  by  another  means  (snaking, friendly  location  marking,  etc.).  (T1).    When  ground  based  lasers/designators  are  used  to designate  targets,  attack  headings  within  ±10°  of  the  laser  designator  to  target  line  (safety zone)  are  prohibited  and  run-in  headings  are  restricted  to  a  50°  cone  on  either  side  of  the safety zone. (T1).  Per AFI 48-139, personnel will not be exposed to laser radiation in excess of  the  Maximum  Permissible  Exposure  (MPE)  levels  as  defined  in  ANSI  Z136.1,  and unnecessary  exposures  to  laser  radiation  below  the  MPE  will  be  avoided.  (Tiering  IAW cited publication). 4.20.  Supersonic Flight.  Supersonic flight restrictions within the US National Airspace System are contained in AFI 13-201.  Overseas locations will comply with host nation rules. 4.21.  Training  on  Non-Federal  Property.  Training  activities  conducted  on  non-federal  real property  are  outside  the  scope  of  this  instruction.    Units  wishing  to  conduct  training  on  non-federal land must comply with DoDI 1322.28. 4.22.  Range Operations Support. 4.22.1.  Supply.    The  ROA  should  establish  procedures  with  the  parent  or  servicing  base supply organization to obtain materials for range operations, as well as salvage and disposal.  When  required,  establish  a  separate  supply  section  at  the  range  to  administer  all  supply activities. AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   51  4.22.2.  Vehicles.  The use of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) vehicles in contract operations should be kept to a minimum.  A cost analysis must be accomplished prior to use of GFE vehicles to determine the best value to the government. 4.22.3.  Utilities.  The ROA will ensure ranges are provided the utilities (gas, water, electric and  sewer)  required  to  enable  range  operations.  (T3).    Commercially  provided  services should be used when available, suitable and cost-effective. 4.23.  Unmanned  Aerial  Systems  (UAS)/Remotely  Piloted  Aircraft  (RPA).  ROAs  shall conduct  a  Risk  Management  assessment  of  UAS/RPA  operations  and  apply  appropriate mitigation measures prior to employment on the range.  At a minimum consider: 4.23.1.  Kinetic energy potential for lethality and property damage. 4.23.2.  Flight paths to avoid endangering concentrations of DoD and civil assets/personnel. 4.23.3.  System maturity and employment methodology 4.23.4.  Mid Air Collision Avoidance through see/sense and avoid, spotter, or chase aircraft. 4.23.5.  Airspace  and  Air  Traffic  Control  coordination.    See  FAA  publications  for  flight requirements in the National Airspace System. 4.23.6.  Robustness and redundancy of vehicle control/telemetry. 4.23.7.  Containment  measures  such  as  a  Flight  Termination  System,  lost  link  software,  or parachute.   52  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 Chapter 5 TRACKING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 5.1.  Reporting Requirements.  Ranges will utilize CSE as the database to track range use such as scheduled and actual  mission information,  supporting  range equipment, munitions used, etc. (T-1).  Note: this does not apply to Class-T ranges that do not manage or use airspace, provided the parent MAJCOM has waived the requirement to use CSE IAW paragraph 2.8.17.  Classified information, if any, must be maintained separately (outside of CSE). 5.2.  Expended  Munitions  Tracking.  IAW  DoDD  4715.11,  Environmental  and  Explosives Safety Management on Operational Ranges Within the United States; and DoDD 4715.12, ROAs will  maintain  records  of  all  expenditures  (types,  quantities,  locations,  using  organization,  and estimated dud rates) of ammunition and explosives for each target. (T0).  Data will be recorded in CSE when possible and by any other means when not.  (T1).  Note: in addition to munitions employed  by  range  users,  this  requirement  also  applies  to  munitions  employed  by  the  range operator in support of test or training activities (e.g., Smokey SAMs). 5.3.  Range  Clearance  Report.  This  report  is  a  detailed  report  of  clearance  events  and  will precisely  identify  the  areas  that  have  been  cleared  and  include  the  number  of  people  and  the amount of money and material used to accomplish the work. (T0).  When closing or transferring ranges the range clearance report will be attached to the Certificate of Clearance which becomes an official document certifying that all dangerous and explosive materials reasonably possible to detect have been removed. (T0). 5.4.  Defense  Readiness  Reporting  System.  IAW  AFI  10-252,  Defense  Readiness  Reporting System,  units  responsible  for  reporting  range  readiness  will  report  between  1  –  31  October annually, or within 72 hours of a change as outlined in AFI 10-252 paragraph 4.2. (T1). 5.5.  Threat  Systems/Equipment  Inventory.  Based  on  the  threat  systems/equipment  required for  each  range  as  outlined  in  Attachment  3,  each  range-owning  MAJCOM  shall  produce  and maintain  an  inventory  of  threat  systems/equipment  (types  and  quantities)  each  range  possesses and an inventory of threat systems/equipment each range requires, but does not possess. 5.5.1.  Include  Air  Combat  Maneuvering  Instrumentation,  Threat,  Electronic  Attack,  and Feedback and Scoring systems in the inventory. 5.5.2.  Provide the inventory to ACC for inclusion in the ERP. AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   53  Chapter 6 RANGE MAINTENANCE AND CLEARANCE OPERATIONS 6.1.  Range Management Guidelines.  Each MAJCOM/ROA is responsible for the clearance of operational  ranges  under  its  control  IAW  DoDI  3200.16,  DoDI  4140.62,  Management  and Disposition  of  Material  Potentially  Presenting  an  Explosive  Hazard  (MPPEH),  and  Title  40 CFR,  Parts  260-270.    Furthermore,  each  MAJCOM/ROA  must  dispose  of  radioactive  wastes IAW  the  Air  Force  Radioactive  and  Mixed  Waste  Office  (AFRMWO)  and  AFI  40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the US Air Force. 6.1.1.  Funding and Scheduling Range Clearances.  The ROA is responsible for funding and scheduling all MPPEH/range clearance, and should include clearance activity planning in the CRP.  The ROA should publish a readily accessible clearance schedule.  The ROA or ROO may  temporarily  postpone  range  clearance  on  a  case-by-case  basis  for  severe  weather  or other unforeseen circumstances that warrant delays. 6.1.2.  EOD Support for Range Clearances.  Development of the annual range clearance plan will be a collaborative effort between the ROA and the associated EOD unit (or MAJCOM) finalized at least six months prior to the first clearance activity. (T2).  If there is no organic EOD capability, establish a policy agreement document for range clearance support with the nearest Air Force EOD flight, if practicable; or if not with the nearest non-AF EOD unit via a MOA and/or ISSA. (T2).  Attempt to synchronize clearances with EOD deployment cycles or periods of high EOD operations tempo. 6.1.2.1.  When the requirement for range clearance support exceeds the capability of the associated  EOD  unit,  shortfalls  are  managed  within  the  EOD  Information  Management System (EODIMS) Range Support Tasking (RST) program. The associated EOD unit (or MAJCOM)  will  enter  RST  requests  into  EODIMS  as  required  to  meet  clearance requirements. 6.1.2.2.  Prepare  a  plan  for  range  clearance  operations  that  at  a  minimum  considers  the number  of  personnel  involved,  types  of  ordnance  anticipated  to  be  encountered  and/or recovered, expected levels of contamination, and support requirements. (T2). 6.1.2.2.1.  The  ROA  will  ensure  the  plan  provides  sufficient  time  to  complete  the planned and anticipated range clearance operations safely. (T2). 6.1.2.2.2.  Consider  requesting  an  advanced  echelon  (ADVON)  element  from  the supporting EOD unit to conduct a GPS mapping survey of UXO-contaminated areas and debris-densities/distances around the targets at least two weeks prior to arrival of the main body for workload estimates and to finalize clearance planning. 6.1.2.3.  Finalize all ROA range scheduling and EOD RST support at least 45 days before the start of the clearance operation. (T3). 6.1.3.  To  identify,  safeguard,  and  dispose  of  UXO,  ROAs  will  ensure  the  following  are accomplished: 6.1.3.1.  Safely  clear  UXO  from  ranges  consistent  with  the  stated  mission  of  the installation  and  for  the  continuing  viability  of  the  range.    Resolve  all  conflicts  between   54  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 explosive  safety  and  other  requirements  with  the  objective  of  minimizing  explosive hazards.  Controlled burning will not be used to accomplish UXO clearance, but may be used to support UXO clearance if environmental and safety requirements are met. (T1). 6.1.3.2.  Respond promptly to protect personnel and property from any UXO located off a military installation IAW AFI 32-3001. (Tiering IAW cited publication). 6.1.3.3.  Notify  installation  personnel  and  the  public,  as  appropriate,  if  any  range operation presents a potential explosive hazard off the range.  This includes informing the public  of  any  mishap  that  could  influence  the  local  community  and  may  require additional precautions and/or restrictions. (T2). 6.1.3.4.  Respond  immediately  to  off-range  releases  or  substantial  threats  of  off-range release  of  hazardous  UXO  constituents,  when  such  release  or  threat  of  release  poses  an imminent and substantial threat to human health or the environment IAW DoD Response authorities under 10 U.S.C. § 2701, Environmental Restoration Program, and 42 U.S.C. §  9604,  Response  Authorities.  (T0).    Consult  with  EOD  and  environmental  offices  on response actions and coverage under the AF environmental restoration program. 6.1.3.5.  On  operational  ranges,  the  procedures  for  evaluating  and  responding  to explosives safety, human health, and environmental risks will be  IAW AFMAN 91-201 and Title 40 CFR Parts 260-270. 6.1.3.6.  Conduct cluster munitions release on designated Impact Areas only and make all reasonable attempts to employ inert and live cluster munitions on different targets. (T0). 6.1.3.7.  To the maximum extent practicable, designate separate Impact Areas for live and inert ordnance training. (T1). 6.1.3.8.  Maintain permanent records of: 6.1.3.8.1.  All  expenditures  (types,  quantities,  locations,  using  organization,  and estimated  dud  rates)  per  target  of  ammunition  and  explosives  IAW  DoDD  4715.11. (T0). 6.1.3.8.2.  All  mishaps  attributed  to  UXO  that  occur  on  or  off  the  installation  IAW DoDI  6055.07,  Mishap  Notification,  Investigation,  Reporting,  and  Record  Keeping. (T0). 6.1.3.8.3.  All  EOD  incidents  or  range  clearance  operations  conducted  on  ranges. (T0). 6.1.3.8.4.  All  areas  known  or  suspected  to  contain  UXOs  using  a  geographic information  system,  range  maps  and/or  installation  master  planning  maps  in compliance  with  the  Spatial  Data  Standards  for  Facilities,  Infrastructure,  and Environment.  Conduct historical research as necessary. (T0). 6.1.3.9.  Remove all munitions debris from targets awaiting disposal. (T0). 6.2.  Range  Clearance  Operations.  Range  clearance  includes  the  removal  or  disposal  of  all ordnance,  inert  ordnance  debris,  Training  Projectile  (TP)  ammunition,  and  other  range  debris reasonably possible to detect (normally down to four inches in size). AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   55  6.2.1.  WARNING:  Range maintenance and clearance operations are prohibited when snow covers  the  ground.    However,  if  specifically  authorized  in  the  MAJCOM  supplement, activities such as clearance, target removal, or target replacement may be performed during these periods. (T1). 6.2.2.  Ordnance  Removal  and  Disposal.    EOD Personnel  or  UXO-Qualified  Personnel  will inspect munitions, munitions components, and targets for the presence of explosive hazards and  will  mark  inspected  items  that  are  “safe  to  move”.  (T1).    Special  attention  should  be provided  during  target  inspection  to  ensure  UXO  are  not  embedded  or  contained  within voids.    “Safe  to  move”  may  be  indicated  by  any  readily  distinguishable  means  that  is mutually agreeable to EOD and the ROA. 6.2.3.  Personnel  assisting  in  range  clearances  will  only  handle  items  that  have  been inspected and marked “safe to move” by EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified Personnel. (T1).  Personnel assisting will be supervised by either EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified personnel to ensure hazardous items are not inadvertently moved or removed. (T1). 6.2.4.  Only EOD Personnel will perform explosive operations to detonate/destroy UXO and energetic material. (T1).  When a fully coordinated waiver or exemption has been approved by  AF/A3OJR,  UXO-Qualified  Personnel  may  perform  limited  explosives  operations  to support  specific  range  clearance  objectives  such  as  venting  practice  bombs  or  destroying spotting  charges.    (Reference  Attachment  1  for  EOD  Personnel  and  UXO-Qualified Personnel definitions). 6.2.5.  MPPEH  Management.    All  munitions,  munitions  debris,  and  target  debris  removed from  a range is  considered MPPEH and shall be managed  IAW explosive safety standards. (T0).  Processing of MPPEH results in either Material Documented as an Explosive Hazard (MDEH)  or  Material  Documented  as  Safe  (MDAS).    Bases  must  institutionalize  chain  of custody processes for MPPEH from collection to final disposition of the hazardous and safe material. (T0).  This is particularly necessary when two or more agencies (e.g., military and contracted)  are  involved  in  the  MPPEH  process.    Refer  to  AFI  21-201,  Conventional Munitions Management, for additional guidance on MPPEH management and disposition. 6.2.5.1.  MPPEH processing (also known as “Range Residue Removal” [R3]) is normally accomplished  by  UXO-qualified  contractors  where  demilitarization  complements  the inspection process to enable a more thorough examination. 6.2.5.2.  Secure  MPPEH  awaiting  processing/inspection  in  a  properly  sited  residue holding  area  (RHA).  (T0).    When  non-EOD  personnel  handle  and  transport  material marked  “safe  to  move”  EOD  Personnel  or  UXO-Qualified  Personnel  will  supervise handling/loading  for  consolidation  at  the  RHA.  (T1).    Only  EOD  Personnel  or  UXO-Qualified Personnel are authorized to handle material after placement in the RHA. (T1).  Ranges may accumulate MPPEH until a cost-effective processing quantity is reached, but shall not delay processing in order to maximize the value of recyclable materials. (T0). 6.2.5.3.  MPPEH  must  be  double-inspected  IAW  DoDI  4140.62  to  identify  and  remove MDEH  before  it  can  be  declared  MDAS.  (T0).    To  prevent  co-mingling,  once  MDEH and  MDAS  are  identified  and  documented  as  such,  they  shall  be  segregated  from  one another and from MPPEH awaiting inspection. (T0).  Segregation may be accomplished   56  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 by any means that ensures physical separation and controlled access (e.g., bins, buildings, or fenced compounds under lock and key). 6.2.5.4.  Disposal  of  MDAS  may  be  accomplished  by  any  means  consistent  with  DoDI 4140.62  and  may  be  accomplished  by  the  Defense  Reutilization  and  Marketing  Service (DRMS) under a MOA  or through direct  commercial sales or contracts.    Only properly inspected and documented MDAS will be released to the public. (T0). 6.2.5.5.  MPPEH  disposal  should  not  be  viewed  as  a  funds  generating  activity.  Management and disposal of MPPEH must consider safety first, and ensure compliance with  the  RCRA  Military  Munitions  Rule  and  (where  applicable)  hazardous  waste management  requirements.    Additionally,  IAW  DoDI  4715.4,  Pollution  Prevention,  the following categories are excluded from being sold through a qualified recycling program: items  that  must  be  demilitarized;  ships,  planes  or  weapons  that  must  undergo demilitarization or mutilation prior to sale; Munitions List items or Strategic List items.  The proceeds from their sale SHALL NOT be returned to a qualified recycling program. (T0). 6.3.  Range Clearance Types and Requirements.  On active ranges programmed for continued use, clear the surface of all UXO, MPPEH, and inert debris as described below. 6.3.1.  The following general rules apply to all clearance activities: 6.3.1.1.  Mechanized gathering procedures coordinated with the associated EOD unit and approved  by  the  Air  Force  Safety  Center  (HQ  AFSEC)  may  be  used  to  clear  sub-scale practice  munitions  (e.g.,  BDU-33)  as  long  as  un-probed  munitions  are  only  handled  by EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified Personnel. 6.3.1.2.  Only  perform  subsurface  UXO  and  subsurface  MPPEH  removal  as  required  in current  or  former  Hazard  Areas  as  required  for  construction,  cable  burial,  etc.    Report subsurface MPPEH removal and range clearance separately. (T1). 6.3.1.3.  Hazard  Areas  used  specifically  for  live  munitions  containing  extremely hazardous  fuzing  (influence,  random-delay,  etc.)  will  be  identified  as  "Extremely Hazardous  Contaminated  Hazard  Areas."    Range  clearance  requirements  of  “Extremely Hazardous Contaminated Hazard Areas” will be based on an Environmental, Safety, and Occupational  Health  (ESOH)  risk  assessment,  and  if  warranted,  a  waiver  or  exemption request  will  be  accomplished  IAW  paragraph  1.5  and  staffed  through  the  appropriate USAF ESOH agencies. 6.3.1.4.  Ranges adjacent to the land of another service that prohibits clearance activities will  be  exempt  from  clearance  requirements  on  those  portions  when  the  other  service provides written acknowledgement of the ramifications.  These areas will be considered “Extremely  Hazardous  Contaminated  Impact  Areas”  and  managed  accordingly  by  the ROA. receive  authorization 6.3.1.5.  ROAs  will to decontaminating/clearing  adjacent  impact  areas.  (T1).    ROAs  will  document  all  access denials  for  clearance  activities  and  report  occurrences  to  the  parent  MAJCOM  and AF/A3OJR. (T2). from  adjacent facilities  prior AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   57  6.3.2.  Low-Angle Strafe Targets.  If used for low-angle strafe by aircraft that fly past or over the  target  within  500  feet  of  the  target  (slant  range),  hand-police  daily  if  utilized  and  clear after 15,000 scored rounds (or twelve use-days for non-scored targets). (T2). 6.3.3.  Improved  Conventional  Munition  (ICM)  targets  (e.g.,  Cluster  Bomb  Unit  grids)  are normally  cleared  after  accumulating  a  specific  number  of  weapons.    The  maximum accumulation amount for  ICM targets  will be specified in  the Range CRP and for approval by  the  MAJCOM  with  the  concurrence  of  AF/A4C.    After  the  maximum  accumulation amount  is  achieved,  clear  ICM  targets  to  the  radius  where  the  debris  density  factor  is  less than five items per acre and at least 500 feet from the target. (T1). 6.3.4.  Range  Clearance  Requirements.  (T1).    Clear  active  ranges  used  for  munitions expenditures  IAW  the  minimum  requirements  defined  in  the  following  sub-paragraphs.  Conduct clearances more frequently or to a greater distance as required to maintain targets or realistic appearance, or where an uneven distribution of weapons results from restricted run-in  headings.    Coordinate  range  clearance  requirements  with  the  associated  EOD  unit  or MAJCOM. 6.3.4.1.  Clear  target  access  roads  and  the  area  50  feet  on  either  side  during  clearance operations  or  target  maintenance  activities  (only  those  roads  noted  on  installation  maps and  those  used  for  sole  access  to  targets/arrays).    Consider  clearing  to  a  greater  side distance  to  accommodate  anticipated  vehicle  traffic  (towed  load,  etc.),  vehicle characteristics (turn radius), and potential obstacles (road damage, UXO, etc.). 6.3.4.2.  Semiannually  or  after  150  use-days  (whichever  comes  later),  clear  the  area around  each  DPI  associated  with  a  high-use  target  to  a  radius  of  150  feet.    Note:  this criteria  applies  to  individual  DPIs  (not  multi-DPI  target  arrays)  that  receive  a  high volume  of  munitions,  where  deferring  clearance  to  the  biennial  interval  would  create  a significant ricochet hazard or significantly increase the range clearance work effort due to the  accumulation  and/or  density  of  UXO.    ROAs  may  determine  these  high-use  targets based on range-specific conditions, in consultation with the MAJCOM. 6.3.4.3.  Biennially, no later than two years since last accomplished, clear the area around a target used for weapons expenditure as follows: 6.3.4.3.1.  Clear  targets  used  for  practice,  inert,  pyrotechnic,  illumination  or  smoke munitions to  either a)  a  radius  of 300 feet,  or b) the shorter radius  where the debris density factor is less than five items per acre. 6.3.4.3.2.  Clear  targets  used  for  high  explosive  munitions  (including  White Phosphorous)  to  either  a)  a  radius  of  500  feet,  or  b)  the  shorter  radius  where  the debris density factor is less than five items per acre. 6.3.4.4.  Decennially, no later than 10 years since last accomplished, clear the area around a target used for weapons expenditure to either a) a radius of 1,000 feet, or b) the shorter radius  where  the  density  of  debris  items  is  less  than  five  per  acre.    ROAs  may  elect  to clear  all areas within 1,000 feet  of targets  every ten  years  and may do so  incrementally (e.g., 20% of the required area biennially for ten years). 6.4.  Range Maintenance and Clearance Safety.   58  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 6.4.1.  WARNING:  Non-EOD  Personnel  will  not  move  or  attempt  to  move  munitions  or targets unless they have been marked “safe to move” by EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified Personnel.  (T0).    This  includes  any  object  that  appears  to  have  been  delivered  on-range  or had  weapons  fired  against  it.    The  sole  exceptions  shall  be  for  training  gun  ammunition which  has  been  expended  on  targets  designated  solely  for  that  use,  and  expended  Smokey SAM missile simulators. (T0). 6.4.2.  Safety Training Requirements. 6.4.2.1.  ROAs  will  ensure  all  range  personnel  engaged  in  range  maintenance  and clearance  operations  receive  ground  and  explosive  safety  briefings  IAW  Attachment  5. (T1). 6.4.2.2.  ROAs  will  ensure  EOD  personnel  receive  orientation  on  ordnance  expected  to be encountered, range vehicle operation, and emergency procedures. (T1). 6.4.2.3.  The Lead EOD flight will ensure non-EOD personnel who are assisting in range clearance  operations  are  briefed  on  explosive  safety  hazards  IAW  AFMAN  91-201,  the markings  used  for  live,  practice,  and  inert  ordnance  found  in  T.O.  11A-1-53,  General Instruction  for  Ammunitions  Color  Coding,  Identification  of  Empty  and  Inert  Loaded Ammunition Items and Components, and Assignment of Version Numbers to Training and Dummy Ammunition Items, and the hazards they may encounter. (T1). 6.4.3.  In addition to communications requirements specified in paragraph 4.7, each working team must have a signaling device for use in the event an uninformed flight crew attempts to use the range. (T3). 6.4.4.  All contractor personnel must adhere to Occupational Safety & Health Administration standards  and/or  DoD  4145.26-M,  DoD  Contractors’  Safety  Manual  for  Ammunition  and Explosives, as applicable. (T0). 6.5.  Range Operations during Range Maintenance and Clearance.  Unless further restricted by  MAJCOM  or  local  range  supplements,  adhere  to  the  following  restrictions  during  range maintenance and clearance operations. (T2). 6.5.1.  Only  simulated  weapons  deliveries,  IAW  applicable  directives,  and  training-mode laser  operations  are  authorized  for  the  duration  of  range  maintenance  and  range  clearance closures  with  the  following  exceptions.  When  the  range  is  divided  as  described  below  all maintenance  and  clearance  activities  must  be  complete  before  air-to-ground  activities  can resume on that  portion.  All  restrictions will be clearly identified in  the range schedule and reinforced by range NOTAMS. 6.5.1.1.  Class  A  Service  Operations.    Range  maintenance  and  clearance  operations  can be conducted on one side of a dual  Class A service range  (except  behind  strafe targets) while the RCO is controlling aircrew training missions on the other side of the range. 6.5.1.2.  Class B and C Service Operations.  Ranges providing Class B and C service are normally  closed  during  maintenance  and  clearance  operations,  but  if  the  range  is  of sufficient size the ROA may authorize continued operations on portions of the range (and adjacent ranges) with the approval of the ground party team chief.  If approved, the ROA will  brief  aircrews  concerning  the  location  of  ground  personnel  and  emphasize  the absolute need for positive target identification. AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   59  6.5.2.  Over Flight Procedures.  Over flight is not authorized without the concurrence of the ground  party  and  RCO/ROO  approval  over  areas  or  portions  of  ranges  during  maintenance and  clearance  operations  in  conjunction  with  the  following  restrictions.    This  ensures  the protection  of  ground  personnel  and  prevents  aircraft  damage  by  fragments  from  explosives operations.  For the purpose of this instruction, the over flight restrictions define a minimum distance in any direction, i.e., a “safety bubble.”  Strict adherence to the procedures outlined below is mandatory. 6.5.2.1.  When  range  maintenance  or  clearance  personnel  are  present  on  the  range  and explosives  operations  are  not  planned,  aircraft  will  remain  above  3,000’  AGL  unless  a lower altitude and distance is specifically approved by the ground party and RCO/ROO. 6.5.2.2.  When explosives operations are planned, aircraft will remain at or above 10,000’ AGL (accounts for potential rogue fragments IAW AFMAN 91-201). 6.5.2.3.  Do not release chaff and flares over range maintenance and clearance operations. 6.5.2.4.  When  no  personnel  are  on  the  range  aircraft  operations  may  proceed  with  no additional altitude restrictions.   60  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 Chapter 7 TEST AND TRAINING USE OF DEPLETED URANIUM 7.1.  Policy and Procedures for Use of Depleted Uranium.  This instruction establishes policy and  procedures  for  the  use  of  Depleted  Uranium  (DU)  on  AF  operational  ranges.    Test  and training  operations  involving  DU  will  be  IAW  this  instruction,  AFI  40-201,  and  the  applicable USAF  Radioactive  Material  Permit  issued  under  the  authority  of  USAF  Master  Materials License by the Air Force Medical Support Agency’s (AFMSA) Radioisotope Committee (RIC). 7.2.  Responsibilities. 7.2.1.  HQ USAF.  The Air Staff provides policy and operational oversight of the use of DU.  Approval authority for the use of DU rests with AF/A3. 7.2.2.  Air Force Medical Support Agency (AFMSA).  The RIC (AFMSA/SG3PB) provides regulatory  oversight  of  all  radioactive  material  used  in  the  Air  Force,  other  than  those classified as falling under Section 91(b) of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) [see 42 U.S.C. § 2121]. 7.2.3.  Unit Commanders. 7.2.3.1.  Ensure that only authorized DU activities are conducted. 7.2.3.2.  Establish  programs  to  ensure  activities  are  accomplished  safely  and  in compliance with requirements. 7.2.3.3.  Identify resources needed to comply with this instruction. 7.2.3.4.  Appoint  a  Radiation  Safety  Officer  with  the  authorities  and  responsibilities identified in AFI 40-201. (Tiering IAW cited publication). 7.2.4.  Personnel Using or Handling Depleted Uranium. 7.2.4.1.  Comply  with  radiation  safety  procedures  outlined  in  the  license  or  permit authorizing  the  storage  or  use  of  DU,  the  referenced  directives,  local  operating instructions  or  directives,  and  verbal  instructions  of  their  Radiation  Safety  Officer  and supervisor. 7.2.4.2.  Halt  any  imminent  danger  situation  immediately,  place  the  operation  in  a  safe configuration, and inform their Radiation Safety Officer or supervisor of unsafe or non-compliant radiological conditions and incidents or accidents involving DU. 7.3.  Authorized Locations.  The use of DU is restricted to sole use Impact Areas permitted by the RIC. (T0).  Except for Combat Mix, all other munitions, live or inert, practice or full-scale, are  prohibited  from  use  in  a  DU  Impact  Area.  (T0).    Testing  of  30  mm  Armor  Piercing Incendiary  (API)  DU  munitions  and  reliability  certification  flight  tests  are  limited  to  the following locations: 7.3.1.  30 mm API DU Testing and Training. 7.3.1.1.  Eglin Air  Force Base,  Florida, Area C-64.  Use to  conduct  life cycle testing of 30mm  API  (PGU-14/B)  ammunition,  rounds  are  fired  into  an  enclosed  gun  butt.    Use AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   61  only  approved  areas  to  handle,  store,  machine,  and  test  R&D  items  within  an  enclosed test chamber. (T1). 7.3.1.2.  Nevada  Test  and  Training  Range,  Nevada,  Target  63-10.    Use  to  conduct  Test and  Evaluation  in  order  to  verify  ballistics,  Operational  Flight  Program  (OFP)  software changes,  Low  Altitude  Safety  and  Targeting  Enhancement  (LASTE)  upgrades,  and  to conduct  USAF  Weapons  School  instructor  pilot  training  and  tactical  employment evaluation using Combat Mix. (T1). 7.3.2.  Stockpile  Surveillance  Flight  Tests  (AF-National  Nuclear  Security  Administration (NNSA) Joint Flight Tests). 7.3.2.1.  NNSA  constructs  Joint  Test  Assemblies  (JTA)  for  Joint  Flight  Tests  based  on NNSA and AF test requirements.  These JTAs may contain DU. 7.3.2.2.  As stated in the AF-NNSA MOA covering joint test and assessment activities, it is  the  joint  policy  of  NNSA  and  the  AF  to  recover  lost  JTAs  whenever  possible  and consistent with US policy and law. 7.3.2.3.  AF-NNSA  Joint  Flight  Tests  are  normally  conducted  at  Utah  Test  &  Training Range  (UTTR),  Eglin  Range,  NNSA’s  test  range  located  within  Tonopah  Test  Range, and Army’s Kwajalein Atoll (Reagan Test Site). 7.3.2.3.1.  Use  of  any  other  AF  range  for  employment  of  Joint  Flight  Test  weapons containing  DU  requires  advance  coordination  with  the  range’s  parent  MAJCOM, AF/A3OJR, and AF/TE. (T-1). 7.3.2.3.2.  Joint  Flight  Test  activities  at  Vandenberg  AFB,  Nellis  AFB,  Eglin  AFB, Whiteman  AFB,  Barksdale  AFB,  and  Minot  AFB  are  limited  to  carrier/weapon interface and carrier launch only. (T-1). 7.3.2.4.  AF ranges supporting Joint Flight Tests will work with the AF RIC to determine whether the impact area requires a radioactive material permit/license, and will obtain the permit/license where required. (T-1). 7.3.2.5.  Use of DU for stockpile surveillance flight tests is authorized under AF auspices by  Section  91(b)  of  the  Atomic  Energy  Act  of  1954  and  falls  under  the  jurisdiction  of AFSEC/SEW. 7.4.  Disposal/Decommission Procedures. 7.4.1.  Disposal  of  Expended  DU  Penetrators.    Expended  DU  penetrators  and  visible fragments will be collected, packaged, and disposed of in coordination with the Installation Radiation  Safety  Officer  and  the  Air  Force  RIC.  (T0).    Before  commencing  clearance actions,  an  EOD  team  will  sweep  the  Impact  Area  and  eliminate  any  UXO  or  explosive hazards. (T1).  Annually, authorized personnel will manually remove visible DU rounds and fragments, and package them for disposal (see paragraph 7.4.1.2). 7.4.1.1.  Authorized  Personnel.    Personnel  trained  in  DU  hazards  and  wearing  the appropriate personal protective equipment, as determined by a qualified health physicist and  the  Installation  Radiation  Safety  Officer,  will  remove  penetrators  and  fragments. (T1).   62  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 7.4.1.2.  Disposal Packing Requirements.  Penetrators and fragments will be packaged for disposal  or  recycling  IAW  instructions  provided  by  AFRMWO.    Prepare  requests  for disposal  or  recycling  IAW  AFI  40-201  and  coordinate  with  the  Installation  Radiation Safety Officer. (T0). 7.4.1.3.  Contaminated Targets.  Vehicles and tanks that are no longer intended to be used as  targets  or  are  so  damaged  from  use  that  they  are  in  need  of  replacement  will  be identified  and  decontaminated  IAW  AFI  40-201  or  have  arrangements  made  for  proper disposal or recycling. (T1). 7.4.2.  Decommission  Plan.    IAW  AFI  40-201,  prior  to  expending  DU  at  any  authorized location,  units  will  develop  a  decommissioning  plan  identifying  costs  to  remediate  DU contamination  at  the  site  based  on  current  technology.   Review  and  update  the decommissioning plan biennially and provide a copy of the plan to the RIC. (T0). AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   63  Chapter 8 NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT AND ENCROACHMENT PREVENTION 8.1.  Range  Natural  Infrastructure  Management  &  Encroachment  Prevention.  In  order  to ensure  mission  readiness,  adequate  natural  infrastructure  (air,  land,  and  water)  and  frequency spectrum  are  needed  to  test,  train,  and  perform  the  Air  Force’s  varied  missions  at  its  ranges.  These  resources  can  be  degraded  or  denied  in  some  locations  due  to  environmental  issues  or encroachment.  Encroachment (defined in AFI 90-2001) comes in many forms, but often results in  diminished  operations  or  significant  workarounds,  inconveniences,  and  additional  costs  of doing business.  Therefore, it is important to maintain natural infrastructure and protect against encroachment wherever possible to meet operational requirements. 8.1.1.  In  order  to  document  and  track  efforts  to  conserve  and  restore  the  natural infrastructure  to  ensure  operational  capability,  each  range  in  conjunction  with  a  multi-disciplinary team, including wing CE (to include EOD), safety, legal, etc., shall develop and maintain a CRP as discussed in paragraph 3.1.11. 8.1.2.  The  CRP  will  document  encroachment  issues,  both  internally  and  externally,  for ranges  and  associated  airspace  describing  impacts  on  the  mission.  (T3).    Internal  factors include, but are not limited to, wetlands, threatened and endangered (T/E) species, hazardous waste  sites,  military  frequency  spectrum  competition,  and  UXO.    External  factors  include, but  are  not  limited  to,  incompatible  land  use  zoning,  frequency  spectrum  restrictions, physical  obstructions  and  renewable  energy  projects,  and  local  and  regional  environmental constraints.  The ROA will work with the installation subject matter experts, the surrounding federal, state, and local governments, commercial entities and MAJCOM offices to minimize external and internal encroachments. (T2). 8.1.3.  The Air Force Encroachment Management Program leverages foundational programs to address installation encroachment challenges.  Operational ranges are a component of the Installation  Complex/Mission  Footprint.    In  addition  to  the  requirement  to  address encroachment within the CRP, ROAs will, IAW AFI 90-2001: 8.1.3.1.  Participate on the Installation Encroachment Management Team. (Tiering IAW cited publication). 8.1.3.2.  Ensure  range-related  encroachment  issues  are  captured  within  the  Installation Complex  Encroachment  Management  Action  Plan  (ICEMAP).  (Tiering  IAW  cited publication). 8.1.4.  Protection  of  human  health,  conservation  of  wetlands  and  endangered  species,  and conservation  of  cultural  resources  are  essential  range  management  activities.    Compliance activities  and  attendant  metrics,  however,  do  not  provide  an  adequate  measure  of  program management  effectiveness  absent  a  clear  linkage  to  operational  requirements.    As  stated  in DoDD 3200.15, Sustaining Access to the Live Training and Test Domain, it is DoD policy to sustain the resiliency and capacity of areas used for training and test.  This requires, among other things, integration of mission requirements with sound resource management as well as natural and cultural principles.   64  AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015 8.2.  Integrated Natural and Cultural Resources Program. 8.2.1.  Air  Force  ranges  will  conserve  natural  and  cultural  resources  pursuant  to  the  Sikes Act,  16  U.S.C.  §  670  et  seq;    Endangered  Species  Act,  16  U.S.C.  §  1531  et  seq;    National Historic Preservation Act, 54 U.S.C. § 300101 et seq. (T0). 8.2.1.1.  The  natural  resources  program  will  be  implemented  by  an  approved  INRMP, which  will  be  written  IAW  AFI  32-7064.  (Tiering  IAW  cited  publication).    The INRMP is the sole tool for implementing the military natural resources program. 8.2.1.2.  The  cultural  resources  program  will  be  implemented  by  an  approved  ICRMP, which  will  be  written  IAW  AFI  32-7065,  Cultural  Resources  Management  Program. (Tiering  IAW  cited  publication).    The  ICRMP  is  the  sole  tool  for  implementing  the military cultural resources program. 8.2.2.  Each  INRMP  and  ICRMP  will  be  written  to  support  the  current  and  future  known mission  requirements  identified  in  the  CRP  and  will  be  amended  as  mission  requirements change significantly. 8.3.  Environmental Compliance, Conservation, and Pollution Prevention. 8.3.1.  Environmental Compliance.  Air Force ranges  will conduct  their activities according to national environmental policy and meet environmental compliance guidelines set forth in AF  and  DoD  instructions,  including  (but  not  limited  to)  AFI  32-7001,  Environmental Management, AFI 32-7047, Environmental Compliance Tracking and Reporting, and DoDI 4715.6,  Environmental  Compliance.    The  Air  Force  will  comply  with  applicable  Federal, State, and local environmental laws and standards.  Air Force activities in foreign countries will comply with the DoD Final Governing Standards, or in their absence, the environmental criteria of the DoD Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document. 8.3.2.  Conservation  and  Pollution  Prevention.    The  Air  Force  will  conserve  natural  and cultural  resources  through  effective  environmental  planning.    The  Air  Force  will  prevent future  pollution  by  reducing  use  of  hazardous  materials  and  releases  of  pollutants  into  the environment  through  source  reduction,  recycling,  and  hazardous  material  substitutions.  Commanders  at  all  levels  as  well  as  all  Air  Force  employees  are  responsible  for  full compliance with national and Air Force environmental policy. 8.3.3.  Military  Munitions  Rule  (MMR).    The  regulations  governing  the  cradle-to-grave management of hazardous waste are codified in Title 40 CFR Parts 260-270.  The portion of those  regulations  that  determine  when  military  munitions  become  solid  waste  and  provide standards for their management as hazardous waste are codified in Title 40 CFR , Part 266, Subpart M, “Military Munitions” (40 CFR §§ 266.200  -- 266.206).  MAJCOMs/ROAs will comply  with  the  standards  established  in  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency’s  (EPA) MMR to meet EPA regulatory requirements on active and inactive ranges. (T0).  Ensure the host CE unit/environmental function is involved in the process. (T3). 8.3.4.  Material  Potentially  Presenting  an  Explosive  Hazard  (MPPEH).    MAJCOMs/ROAs will manage active and inactive ranges under their control to maintain long-term viability of DoD  ranges  while  protecting  human  health  and  the  environment  and  to  minimize  future clearance  costs.  (T1).    Ranges  and  munitions  should  be  designed  to  minimize  potential explosive hazards and harmful environmental impacts and to promote resource recovery and AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   65  recycling.  Each  MAJCOM/ROA  will  comply  with  DoDI  4140.62,  DoDD  4715.11,  and DoDD 4715.12. (T0). 8.4.  Programming  Guidance.  Eligible  environmental  requirements  shall  be  identified  for funding in ACES (or successor system).  The ranges shall project environmental requirements in Program Objective Memorandum (POM) submissions.  AFCEC Installation Support Teams can assist  in  identifying  projects  eligible  for  environmental  funding  versus  environmentally  related operational requirements that must be funded with the ranges operations and maintenance funds.  Projects will be programmed IAW AFI 32-7001 or AFI 32-7020, The Environmental Restoration Program, as appropriate. (T1). is  critical  for 8.5.  Environmental  Inventory.  It the  Air  Force  Operational  Range Environmental Program to have an accurate inventory of environmental attributes of operational ranges.    This  inventory  supports  informed  and  accurate  environmental  resource  decisions  to sustain our operational ranges into the future. Each range shall respond to annual data calls and provide  the  requested  information  in  coordination  with  the  host  CE  squadron/environmental office. (T2). 8.6.

It  does  not  encompass  all  pertinent  terms.  Joint  Publication  1—02,  DoD Dictionary  of  Military  and  Associated  Terms,  and  AFDD  1-2,  Air  Force  Glossary,  contain standardized terms and definitions for DoD and USAF use. Air  Combat  Training  Systems  (ACTS)—A  general  term  referring  to  aircraft  instrumentation pods,  ground  receiving  equipment,  and  interface/display  equipment  used  for  live  monitoring, capture, and replay/debrief of training missions. Air Force Representative (AFREP)—An Air Force officer stationed at HQ FAA or a regional office and accredited by AF/A3 to provide USAF representation to FAA on airspace/range and air traffic control matters. Alert  Area—Airspace  designated  to  inform  pilots  of  a  high  level  of  training  activity  or  any unusual  activity  where  prior  knowledge  would  significantly  enhance  air  safety.  There  are  no restrictions placed on non-participating IFR or VFR aircraft. Armor  Piercing  Incendiary  (API)—A  30mm  round  consisting  of  a  0.66  pound  extruded  DU penetrator, alloyed with 0.75 weight percent titanium, encased in a 0.8 mm-thick aluminum shell and windscreen. Byproduct Material—Radioactive material (except Source or Special Nuclear Material) yielded in  or  made  radioactive  by  exposure  to  radiation,  incident  to  the  process  of  producing  or  using Source or Special Nuclear Material. Certificate  of  Clearance—An  official  document  that  certifies  removal  of  all  dangerous  and explosive materials reasonably possible to detect. The certificate is dated, and a range clearance report is attached. The cleared areas are identified in red crosshatch on a map, and annotated in the map legend. Common  Installation  Picture—The  standard  USAF  geospatial  data  set  that  depicts  facilities and physical features on an installation. The CIP is comprised of georeferenced vector layers in a digital format with related attribute information and a georeferenced imagery layer   See AFI 32-10112 for additional information. Comprehensive  Range  Planning—An  iterative  process  that  examines  current  and  projected operational needs to identify the best use for limited range development resources and the largest threats to the military value of ranges and airspace. Comprehensive  Range  Plan  (CRP)—The  range  commander’s  plan,  approved  by  the MAJCOM,  that  baselines  the  range,  establishes  the  Vision  with  supporting  goals  and  develops the strategy for attaining the vision through objectives and an implementation approach. Controlled  Firing  Area  (CFA)—An  area  in  which  ordnance  firing  is  conducted  under controlled  conditions  so  as  to  eliminate  hazards  to  non-participating  aircraft,  and  to  ensure  the safety of persons and property on the ground. Aeronautical charts do not depict CFAs. Controlling  Agency—Air  Traffic  Control  (ATC)  facility  responsible  for  providing  airborne control services in and around a designated airspace.

Depleted Uranium (DU)—DU is the resultant “waste” of the Uranium-235 enrichment process.  The radioisotope ratio in DU is 0.4% Uranium-235 (maximum) and 99.6% Uranium-238.  DU is a dense, heavy metal and has two properties that make it ideal for military applications: extreme density and the tendency to ignite on impact (especially with steel). Directed  Energy  Weapon  (DEW)—A  weapon  system  using  directed  energy  primarily  as  a direct  means  to  deny,  disrupt,  degrade  (damage),  or  destroy  enemy  equipment,  facilities,  or personnel. Electronic Warfare Range (EWR)—This term has traditionally taken on a narrow definition of referring only to those ranges with an Electronic Warfare (EW) capability that is associated with and located on a range capable of receiving surface fires and actual ordnance delivery.  However, with  the  proliferation  of  EW  capabilities  across  all  the  Air  Force  ranges,  the  term  is  now generally understood to refer to any range with an EW capability. Electronic  Warfare  Site  (EWS)—An  EWS  is  a  specific  type  of  Electronic  Warfare  (EW) training  area  which  is  not  located  within  the  boundaries  of  another  range.    Typically,  the  land required for an EWS is minimal and they do not support actual ordnance delivery.  They can be located  at  any  location  with  proper  security  and  are  usually  located  under  or  near  a  Military Training  Route  (MTR)  or  Military  Operations  Area  (MOA).    In  previous  versions  of  this publication, this type of training area was referred to as an Electronic Scoring Site (ESS), despite the fact that many of these sites did not have scoring capability. Emitter/Simulator—Generic  terms  used  to  describe  threat  equipment  operated  at  Electronic Warfare Ranges (EWR) and Electronic Warfare Sites (EWS). However, Air Combat Command operates  a  variety  of  equipment  including,  but  not  limited  to,  Emitter  only  systems,  Emitter-Receiver-Processors, and replica type systems.    Carefully  compare the similarities and features of different  systems  and consider operational  requirements.  Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) and Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA) simulators include all manned and unmanned threat emitters. Environmental  Impact  Analysis  Process  (EIAP)—The  formal  Air  Force  process  for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Council on Environmental Quality’s  NEPA  Regulations,  used  to  support  Air  Force  decision  making  and  assess environmental impacts resulting from a proposed action and its reasonable alternatives. Environmental  Planning  Function  (EPF)—At  every  level  of  command,  the  EPF  is  a  key participant  responsible  for  the  EIAP.  At  the  request  of  the  proponent,  the  EPF  manages  the preparation  of  environmental  documents  and  assists  the  proponent  in  obtaining  review  of environmental documents. Essential Personnel—Those personnel on a range, not required for ordnance employment, that participate  and  provide  essential  support  for  the  range  test,  training  or  evaluation  mission.  Examples include maneuver elements, opposition forces, instructors, evaluators, range personnel conducting maintenance, etc. AFI13-212V1  23 APRIL 2015   79  Explosive  Ordnance  Disposal  (EOD)—The  detection,  identification,  on-site  evaluation, rendering  safe,  recovery,  and  final  disposal  of  unexploded  explosive  ordnance.

EOD  Personnel/Technician—Military  personnel  who  have  graduated  from  the  Naval  School, Explosive  Ordnance  Disposal;  are  assigned  to  a  military  unit  with  a  Service-defined  EOD mission;  and  meet  Service  and  assigned  unit  requirements  to  perform  EOD  duties.  EOD Personnel  have  received  specialized  training  to  address  explosive  and  chemical  agent  hazards during both peacetime and wartime. EOD Personnel are trained and equipped to perform Render Safe  Procedures  (RSP)  on  nuclear,  biological,  chemical,  and  conventional  munitions,  and  on improvised explosive devices. (DoD Definition) Government Controlled—Control exercised by any federal government agency. Hazard  Area—The  composite  area  of  all  Weapon  Danger  Zones  (WDZs),  Surface  Danger Zones  (SDZs),  Laser  Surface  Danger  Zones  (LSDZs),  and  Directed  Energy  Weapon  Danger Zones (DEWDZs) for all authorized weapon delivery events. Impact Area—The area on a range immediately surrounding a target or designated mean point of  impact  that  is  approved  for  the  actual  delivery  of  ordnance.  The  Impact  Area  demarcation should normally be no less than a) 500 feet from the center of a target or desired point of impact (DPI) approved for live ordnance, or b) 300 feet from the center of a target or DPI used solely for inert or practice ordnance. Isotope—Nuclides  having  the  same  number  of  protons  in  their  nuclei,  and  hence  the  same atomic  number,  but  differing  in  the  number  of  neutrons,  and  therefore  in  the  mass  number. Almost  identical  chemical  properties  exist  between  isotopes  of  a  particular  element.    Unstable isotopes undergo radioactive decay to achieve stability. Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC)—An individual qualified IAW JP 3-09.3 to provide terminal control for the delivery of weapons by aircraft. Joint  Use—With respect  to  ranges, Joint Use means other MAJCOMs or services may  use,  as long  as  they  conduct  operations  IAW  this  instruction,  as  supplemented.  With  respect  to  range airspace, it means the use by civil or other military aviation when it is not active. Land  Withdrawal—The  process  used  as  a  means  to  transfer  administrative  jurisdiction  from one federal agency to another. A withdrawal creates a title  encumbrance on the land restricting an  agency's  ability  to  manage  its  lands  under  multiple  use  management  principles.  The restrictions generally segregate the lands from some or all the public land laws and some or all of the  mining  and  mineral  leasing  laws  for  a  specific  period  of  time  (generally  20  years  for  post FLPMA withdrawals). The Secretary of Interior is authorized to make, modify, extend, or revoke withdrawals.

Military  Training  Route  (MTR)—A  low-level,  high-speed  training  route  established  IAW criteria in FAA Joint Order 7610.4, Special Operations. MTRs are used by DoD to conduct low altitude  navigation  and  tactical  training,  in  instrument  and  visual  weather  conditions,  below  an altitude of 10,000 feet MSL and at airspeeds more than 250 KIAS. Routes are established as IFR routes  (IR)  or  VFR  routes  (VR).  The  FAA  has  approval  authority  to  implement  IRs  and  the appropriate MAJCOM approves VR implementation. Environmental documentation is  required for implementation IAW 32 CFR Part 989. VRs are processed through the FAA via the AFREP. MTRs are published in FLIP AP/1B and charted on  FAA Sectionals and DoD Low IFR charts. AFREPs assign all route numbers. Mission Essential Personnel—Those personnel on a range directly required for the employment of ordnance (air/surface/EA) in a test, training or evaluation mission.
