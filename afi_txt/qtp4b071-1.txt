A lead assessor is necessary to coordinate and manage the assessment team. It is his/her responsibility to assign all tasks associated with the assessment and to ensure that the assessment is completed on schedule.  2.  Individuals from various organizations that can support data collection requests are identified. The team members should have strong technical backgrounds and familiarity with TIC/TIM assessment methodology; Site-specific TICs/TIMs, including installation infrastructure, base operations, and off-base industries; TIC/TIM characteristics and health effects; and transport of contaminants via air (outdoors and indoors) and water.  3.  Stakeholders, those with an interest in the outcome of the assessment, can include those organizations above with the addition of others not directly involved in the assessment. Collectively, they can include the following individuals, organizations and entities:     Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE)    Radiation Safety Officer (RSO)    Antiterrorism Officer (ATO)    Office of Special Investigations (OSI)/Intel    Security Forces    Civil Engineering (CE)  o  Emergency Management (EM)  o  Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) representative  o  Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-know Act (EPCRA) point-of-contact (POC)  o  Fire Department   19 AFQTP 4B071-1                                                                      Craftsman Training Guide:  OEH Program Overview  o  Pest Management  o  GeoBase POC  o  Hazardous Waste Program Manager  o  Real Property Officer   Hazardous Material Pharmacy Manager    Safety Office    Weather Office    Public Health    Contractor Support    Off-Base LEPC Representative(s)    Off-Base SERC Representative(s)    Railroad Company Environmental Safety Officer(s).   Use Form 1-1: Stakeholders Listing, from the TIC/TIM VulnerabilityAssessment Technical Guide.  4.  It is recommended that the TIC of concern include toxic substances regulated under EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) program and toxic chemicals for which NIOSH has determined Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) concentration values. The TIMs also include Toxic Industrial Biologicals (TIBs) and Toxic Industrial Radiologicals (TIRs).   5.   The assessors should collect information about the various transportation routes (railway, highway, and waterway) proximal to the base and evaluate each for the possibility of a TIC/TIM release. Railroad companies and trucking firms maintain records/manifests that list type, quantity, and frequency of shipments that could impact a site assessment.  6.  The possible sources to contact may include the following:    HAZMART Pharmacy to obtain a list of hazardous materials (to include toxics) from the master chemical authorization database   Hazardous Waste Program Manager to obtain a copy of the latest hazardous waste stream inventory   Central Hazardous Waste Storage Facility Manager to obtain information on hazardous waste stored at the installation hazardous waste storage facility    Base Supply to obtain a list of any chemicals on base that are not obtained through HAZMART Pharmacy   CE Storage Tank Manager to obtain information on any storage tanks containing toxic chemicals (e.g., hydrazine,  hydrochloric acid) Installation Fire Department and/or EM to obtain information on response scenarios based on known chemicals on base Installation Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) to obtain information on industrial radiation sources on base.    Medical Infection Control Officer to obtain a list of TIBs  7.  Use Form 1-3: Toxic Industrial Chemicals/Toxic Industrial Materials (TIC/TIM) Inventory, from TIC/TIM Vulnerability Assessment Technical Guide to compile comprehensive TIC/TIM inventory.  8.  The base map should be wide-ranging enough to include Zone 1 (an area where death may result), Zone 2 (an area where severe injuries and/or illnesses may result), and Zone 3 (an area where minor injuries and/or illnesses may result). The map should include at least a 20-mile radius around the base. Use the map for identifying location of TIC/TIM.  9.  Wind speed, wind direction, and atmospheric stability are expressed using the Pasquill stability classes. Use Form 1-2: Meteorological Data Worksheet, from TIC/TIM Vulnerability Assessment Technical Guide.  10.  Use Form 1-4: Levels of Concern (LOCs) Table for TIC from TIC/TIM Vulnerability Assessment Technical Guide.  11.  The following data elements should be included on these maps:    TIC/TIM identifiers and locations   Base facilities and critical assets    Transportation assets, including roads, railroads, and base access points  12.  Form 1-5: TIC/TIM Inventory Hazard Zones from the TIC/TIM Vulnerability Assessment Technical Guide can be used in determining each scenario  20 AFQTP 4B071-1                                                                      Craftsman Training Guide:  OEH Program Overview   13.  The severity rating can be catastrophic, critical, moderate, or negligible. The probability rating is expressed as frequent (or likely), occasional, seldom, or unlikely. Use the Operational Risk Management (ORM) Risk Assignment Matrix to assign risk to each scenario. It is located on page 29 of USAFSAM, Toxic Industrial Chemicals/Toxic Industrial Materials Vulnerability Assessment Technical Guide, July 2009  14.  Upon completion of the field assessment, the team should document and consolidate results. The report should include the following elements:    Executive Summary  Introduction   Methodology   Scope and Limitations   TIC/TIM Assessment and Inventory   Risk Assessment   Conclusion   References   Appendices (forms, maps/plots, weather data, comprehensive inventory)  The report will typically be generated in classified and/or unclassified version(s). A classified version is stored on the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) and is available only to personnel with the proper security clearance.     21 AFQTP 4B071-1                                                                      Craftsman Training Guide:  OEH Program Overview  TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS        STS Line Item 4.1.4:  Perform TIC/TIM vulnerability assessment  1.

How is a site’s atmospheric stability expressed, and what are the conditions defined?    A:  Atmospheric stability is expressed in terms of Pasquill’s stability class definitions which are as follows:    A = Very unstable   B = Unstable   C = Slightly unstable   D = Neutral   E = Slightly stable   F = Stable [Source:  USAFSAM, Toxic Industrial Chemicals/Toxic Industrial Materials Vulnerability Assessment Technical Guide, July 2009 (Updated September 2010)]     2.  When conducting a TIC/TIM vulnerability assessment, at what point during the process does the document become classified as CONFIDENTIAL or SECRET, and why?   A:  During the analysis phase, the TIC/TIM VA information may need to be treated as classified information because the information gathered is evaluated to determine their potential impact to the base.  And once a document identifies vulnerabilities or concerns associated with a specific US military site, it will be classified as CONFIDENTIAL or SECRET.  Once this phase of the TIC/TIM VA has begun, caution should be taken to protect the information, including working on a computer designed to handle SECRET documents (i.e., a SIPRNet computer).

How can DOEHRS be used for risk communication to commanders and supervisors?  A:  BE personnel may use DOEHRS to create reports for risk communication to commanders and supervisors.  (Source:  4B051 CDC)  2.  What feature of DOEHRS allows for reviews of health risk assessment data?  A:  DOEHRS provides personnel the capability to perform Quality Assurance (QA) reviews.  (Source:  4B051 CDC) 3.  How are personnel managed within DOEHRS, and why is this important?  A:  Personnel must first be added to a shop, then to processes, and finally grouped into SEGs.  To execute the IH function properly, people must ultimately be associated to shops and processes.  Active management of personnel within the DOEHRS application is necessary to ensure exposures are adequately documented for all assigned personnel.    (Source:  DOEHRS Guidance Document)  4.  What is a hazard within DOEHRS, and how do they get managed within DOEHRS to complete health risk assessments?   A:  A hazard within DOEHRS is the existence of a completed pathway of exposure to a stressor that has the ability or potential to cause harm.  DOEHRS facilitates the completion of a health risk assessment for all identified hazards to determine whether a hazardous or unacceptable condition exists.  Hazards can be chemical, physical, biological as well as ergonomic.  In an ideal world of unconstrained resources, every stressor would be identified and the degree of risk captured.  In reality, some professional judgment will need to be applied.  (Source:  DOEHRS Guidance Document) 30
