Units  will  conduct  all  evaluations  in  accordance  with  the provisions of AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and this instruction.  (T-2). 1.2.  Procedures: 1.2.1.  Flight  examiners  (FE)  use  the  evaluation  criteria  contained  in  Chapter  3  for conducting flight and emergency procedures evaluations (EPE).  (T-2).  To ensure standard and  objective  evaluations,  each  FE  must  become  thoroughly  familiar  with  the  prescribed evaluation criteria. 1.2.2.  Unless  specified,  the examinee or FE may fly in  the seat  that best  enables the  FE to conduct  a  thorough  evaluation.    The  FE  normally  occupies  the  left  seat  during  periodic instructor mission evaluations. 1.2.3.  Prior  to  the  flight,  the  FE  briefs  the  examinee  on  the  purpose  of  the  evaluation  and how  it  is  conducted.    The  examinee  accomplishes  required  flight  planning  during  the evaluation and furnishes the FE a copy of necessary mission data and maps if required. 1.2.4.  The FE thoroughly  debriefs all aspects  of the flight.   These debriefs will include the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified), and  any  required  additional  training.    A  squadron  supervisor  must  attend  the  debrief  if  the overall grade is Q-3.  (T-2). 1.2.5.  To  initially  qualify  as  an  instructor,  a  pilot  must  successfully  complete  a  dedicated initial  instructor  evaluation.    Subsequently,  crewmembers  designated  as  instructors  will  be evaluated on their ability to instruct during all periodic evaluations.  (T-2).  The FE will act as a student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s instructional ability. 1.3.  Grading Instructions: 1.3.1.  Tolerances  in  performance  parameters  are  based  on  conditions  of  smooth  air  and stable  aircraft  conditions.    Momentary  deviations  from  tolerances  are  not  considered  in grading provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying safety.  Consider cumulative deviations when determining the area grade. 1.3.2.  FEs  will  use  the  evaluation  criteria  in  paragraphs  1.3.5  and  3.1  to  determine individual area grades.  When individual areas are performed well above the grading criteria standards,  FEs will make appropriate  comments  stating performance  and/or instruction was commendable  in  the  Examiner’s  Remarks  in  the  Comments  block  of  the  AF  Form  8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.  (T-2).  FEs must exercise judgment when the wording of areas is subjective and specific situations are not covered. 1.3.3.  The  FEs  will  derive  the  overall  flight  evaluation  grade  (Q-1,  Q-2,  or  Q-3)  from  the area grades, based on a composite of the observed events and tasks according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, this instruction, and FE judgment.  (T-2). 1.3.4.  Critical  areas  require  adequate  accomplishment  by  the  examinee  in  order  to successfully achieve the mission objectives.  If the examinee receives an unqualified grade in any  critical  area,  the  overall  grade  for  the  evaluation  will  be  unqualified  (Q-3).    (T-2).    4  AFI11-2UV-18V2  19 MARCH 2015 Critical  areas  are  identified  by  “(Critical)”  in  the  area  title  in  Chapter  3.    Grade  critical areas as “Q” or “U.” 1.3.5.  The general evaluation criteria in Table 1.1 apply during all phases of flight (except as noted within the evaluation criteria in Chapter 3). Table 1.1.  General Evaluation Criteria. A I T E M 1  Altitude 2  Airspeed 3  Heading General Area B Q C Q- D U ± 100 feet ± 5 knots Maintains  or  rolls  out  ±5 degrees of desired heading ± 200 feet ± 10 knots Maintains or rolls out ± 10 degrees of desired heading Exceeds Q- limits 1.4.  Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE): 1.4.1.  The FE will administer an oral EPE either on the ground or in flight.  (T-2).  During the evaluation, the FE will include a sampling of emergency procedures resolved to a logical conclusion. 1.4.2.  The  FE  will instrument/qualification EPE (T-2): include  an  evaluation  of the following items  on  an 1.4.2.1.  Aircraft general knowledge. 1.4.2.2.  Emergency  procedures.    Evaluate  all  boldface  procedures  and  at  least  one noncritical aircraft emergency procedure. 1.4.2.3.  Alternate or divert airfields. 1.4.2.4.  Cockpit/crew resource management (CRM). 1.4.3.  The FE will include an evaluation of jump emergencies on a mission EPE.  (T-2). 1.4.4.  Units will not permit examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade (Q-3) because of  an  unsatisfactory  EPE  to  fly  in  any  aircrew  position  until  the  examinee  completes  a successful  reevaluation.    (T-2).    For  each  EPE  graded  “qualified  with  additional  training required,” the FE will indicate whether the additional training must be accomplished before the next flight. 1.5.  Completion of AF Form 8.  Record and certify aircrew member qualification using the AF Form  8  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-202,  Volume  2.    Additionally,  with  the  exception  of restrictions and exceptionally qualified designation (if used), place all comments on the reverse side of the AF Form 8. 1.6.  Changes.  USAF/A3 is approval authority for changes or revisions to this instruction. AFI11-2UV-18V2  19 MARCH 2015   5  Chapter 2 EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS 2.1.  General: 2.1.1.  There  are  five  types  of  evaluations  in  the  UV-18:  qualification  (QUAL),  mission (MSN), instrument (INSTM), instructor (INSTR), and SPOT.  Evaluations include requisites and  required  areas.    Table  2.1  indicates  when  a  requisite  is  required  (R)  for  an  evaluation.  Table  2.2  prescribes  required  areas  that  must  be  included  in  the  flight  evaluation  profile.  Evaluation areas are aligned under the type of evaluation. 2.1.2.  If it is impossible to accomplish a required area in flight, the FE may elect to evaluate the  areas  by  an  alternate  method  (aircrew  training  device,  orally,  etc.)  in  order  to  complete the evaluation.  If the FE determines the required item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate  method,  the  examinee  must  complete  an  additional  flight  to  complete  the evaluation.    The  FE  will  document  the  alternate  evaluation  method  in  the  Examiner’s Remarks in the Comments block of AF Form 8. 2.2.  Requisites.  Table 2.1 indicates the minimum requisites for each type of evaluation.  When evaluations are combined, the examinee will accomplish all requisites for each evaluation.  (T-2).  The  FE  will  document  requisites  in  the  ground  phase  of  the  AF  Form  8.    Units  will  combine similar exams into a single test and enter as one requisite on the AF Form 8. Table 2.1.

Include  all  required areas  from  Table  2.2  (for  the  evaluations  given)  in  the  flight  evaluation  profile.    The examinee  will  accomplish  a  normal  instrument  flight  rules  (IFR)  departure.    Evaluate  a sampling of instrument maneuvers including unusual attitudes, holding, fix-to-fix, circling, or arcing.    On  MSN  evaluations,  evaluate  Area  33,  Wind  Drift  Indicator  (WDI)/Jump  Pattern Procedures (simulated or actual).   6  AFI11-2UV-18V2  19 MARCH 2015 2.3.3.
