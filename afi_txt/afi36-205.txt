Program Purpose.  The AEP is a program of positive action in all personnel administration and  management  matters,  including  recruitment,  employment,  and  promotion,  designed  to promote  equal  opportunity  and  to  identify  and  eliminate  discriminatory  practices  and  policies.  The Air Force is  legally required to  take proactive steps to  ensure EEO for all  employees and applicants  for  employment  by  regularly  evaluating    employment  practices  to  identify  and eliminate  barriers  that  hamper  the  advancement  of  any  individual  on  the  basis  of  race,  color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity and sexual orientation), national origin, age, disability,  genetic  information,  or  reprisal.    The  Air  Force  is  also  legally  required  to  provide reasonable  accommodation  to  qualified  individuals  with  disabilities  who  are  employees  or applicants for employment, unless to do so would cause undue hardship.  The SEP are designed to enhance the employment and advancement opportunities of all EEO groups. 1.2.  Applicability and Scope.  This instruction supersedes all previous Air Force regulatory and policy guidance on this matter. 1.3.  Definitions.  Terms used in this instruction are defined in Attachment 1. 1.4.  Policies. 1.4.1.  Air Force Policy.  The Air Force recognizes and supports the principles of EEO.  Air Force managers and supervisors are responsible for affecting these principles in all personnel management  decisions  and  for  making  EEO  considerations  an  integral  part  of  the management  process.    It  is  Air  Force  policy  that  civilian  personnel  management  be accomplished  in  a  manner  that  is  free  from  unlawful  discrimination  and  provides  equal opportunity  for  all  applicants  and  employees  regardless  of  their  race,  color,  religion,  sex (including pregnancy, gender identity and sexual orientation), national origin, age, disability, genetic information, or prior EEO activity (reprisal).  Therefore, it is against Air Force policy for any Airman (military or civilian) to unlawfully discriminate against, harass, intimidate or threaten  another  Airman  (military  or  civilian)  on  the  basis  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex (including pregnancy, gender identity and sexual orientation), national origin, age, disability, genetic  information,  or  reprisal.  The  Air  Force  does  not  tolerate  harassment  at  any  level  in the  workforce  and  will  take  disciplinary  action  as  appropriate.    Responsibility  for implementation of the Air Force policy on EEO and affirmative employment will be shared by management personnel at all levels and designated AEP and EO officials (T-0).  The AEP is designed to ensure that: 1.4.1.1.  All  personnel  actions  and  employment  practices  are  based  on  merit  and qualifications and not on any unlawful factors. 1.4.1.2.  No  person  shall  be  excluded  from  participation  in,  denied  the  benefits  of,  or subjected to discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender  identity  and  sexual  orientation),  national  origin,  age,  disability,  genetic information,  or  prior  EEO  activity  (reprisal)  under  any  program  or  activity  either conducted by the Air Force or receiving federal financial assistance disbursed by the Air Force (T-0). 8 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 1.4.1.3.  Any personnel management policy, procedure, or practice that may result in any advantage in employment or deny equality of opportunity to any group or individual on the  basis  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex  (including  pregnancy,  gender  identity  and  sexual orientation),  national  origin,  age,  disability,  genetic  information,  or  prior  EEO  activity (reprisal) should be corrected or eliminated. 1.4.1.4.

Functional  Location  of  the  AEP.  The primary responsibility for policy oversight for the Air  Force  AEP  rests  with  AF/A1Q;  coordinating  responsibility  for  AEP  policy  oversight  rests with  AF/A1C.    The  AEP  function  is  aligned  with  the  organization  responsible  for  civilian personnel policies and programs at the MAJCOM level and in AF/A1Q at the Headquarters Air Force level.   Although the recruitment  mechanisms for achieving AEP objectives are primarily located within AFPC, the responsibility for accomplishment of program objectives rests with Air Force management. 2.1.1.  The AEP function and AEP Manager are organizationally located/functionally aligned in the Civilian Personnel Section (CPS), at the installation level, unless delegated to the EO office  by  the  installation  commander.    In  all  cases,  the  AEP  and  EO  programs  must  be handled separately and distinctly, e.g. the AEPM cannot be an EO Specialist or EO collateral duty counselor.  Per EEOC Management Directive 110, August 2015, in order for the EEO complaint  program  to  impartially  carry  out  its  responsibility  to  identify  and  eliminate discriminatory practices/policies, the agency’s personnel function must be kept separate from the  EEO  complaint  process.    The  AEP  program  must  function  IAW  this  AFI  and  other regulatory  guidance  and  be  resourced  with  appropriately  qualified  personnel  and  funding.  Installation commanders aligning the AEP to the EO office must provide written notification to AF/A1Q, to include the AEPM contact information for that location (T-1). 2.2.  Responsibilities of the Installation AEPM.  The installation AEPM will: 2.2.1.  Develop procedures, implement, and manage the installation’s AEP and the six SEPs identified in  Chapter 3.   Provide program  management for special  observances  (IAW 3.19) (T-2).    The  installation  AEPM  will  work  with  appropriate  offices,  including  the  CPS  and NAF-HRS,  the  EO  Office,  and  the  Integrated  Delivery  System  (IDS)  to  advise  the commander, managers, and supervisors on the proactive steps being taken to ensure EEO for all employees and applicants for employment, by regularly evaluating employment practices to identify and eliminate barriers that hamper the advancement of any individual on the basis of  race,  color,  religion,  sex  (including  pregnancy),  national  origin,  age,  disability,  genetic information, or reprisal as appropriate (T-2). 2.2.2.  Develop  and  evaluate  the  AEP  and  SEP  goals  and  objectives  for  strategic  planning and long-range implementation (T-1). 2.2.3.  In  conjunction  with  the  SEPMs,  CPS,  EO  and  NAF-HRS  staff  members  and functional managers, serve as the responsible official in preparation of the MD-715 report as required in 6.3., the installation AEPP and best practices (T-3). 2.2.4.  Conduct  comprehensive  analysis  of  affirmative  employment  efforts  to  include workforce  composition,  outreach internal  advancement, performance, employee development, discipline, and awards/recognition (T-1). recruiting,  employment, 2.2.5.

The installation AEPM will advise management officials of triggers or barriers identified and provide recommendations on corrective actions (T-1). 16 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 2.2.6.  Prepare and present briefings in both informal and formal settings to senior leadership and other management personnel (see 6.4.1.) (T-1). 2.2.7.  Provide  advice,  technical  oversight  and  guidance  to  all  SEPMs  and  input  to  the SEPMs supervisor on the execution of the SEPM duties (T-2). 2.2.8.  Recommend  whether  SEPM(s)  should  be  appointed  on  a  full-time  or  collateral  duty basis which constitutes at least 20 percent of assigned duty time.  The installation AEPM will ensure size and composition of the workforce is factored into the decision if SEPMs are full time or collateral duty (T-2). 2.2.9.  If a SEP appointment is designated as a collateral duty, ensure that the supervisor or an appropriate management official endorses and approves the assignment of collateral duties (T-2). 2.2.10.  Forward  recommended  SEPM  selectees appointment (T-2). to the installation  commander  for 2.2.11.  In  coordination  with  each  SEPM,  develop  annual  SEP  objectives  and  a  plan  to accomplish those objectives, including required training for the SEPM, specific activities and target dates, resources required, and criteria for evaluating program achievements (T-2). 2.2.12.  Use  various  installation  media  to  distribute  AEP  and  SEP  information,  i.e., requirements, duties, and responsibilities, and to promote workplace best practices (T-2). 2.2.13.  Establish contact and host meetings, periodically, with relevant community groups to discuss AEP and SEP issues, as appropriate, and maintain constructive relationships (T-2). 2.3.  Initial and Recurring Training for the AEPM. 2.3.1.  Newly  assigned  AEPMs  will  attend  the  DEOMI  SEPM  course  and  will  have  the option to attend the Disability Program Management course (T-2). 2.3.1.1.  If  a  newly  assigned  AEPM  has  attended  the  DEOMI  Disability  Program Management and SEPM training in the past five years, this requirement can be waived. 2.3.2.  It  is  highly  recommended  that  AEPMs  attend  other  courses  and  types  of  training designed to expand their expertise in AEP and SEP concepts and enhance their performance as AEPMs. 2.4.  Publicity Requirements for the AEP.  The AEPM will ensure the information listed below is accessible to all employees and is permanently posted on official bulletin boards, electronic or free standing. 2.4.1.  Appropriate local directives including the commander’s supplemental policy guidance and  those  portions  of  the  AEP  objectives  which  state  the  program  objectives  of  the installation or organization (T-2). 2.4.2.  The  names,  organizational  assignments,  and  duty  telephone  numbers  of  the  SEPMs and  the  designated  installation  official  responsible  for  the  AEPM  and  SEPMs  (T-2).    The installation  AEPM  must  ensure  this  information  is  kept  current  and  provided  to  the appropriate MAJCOM AEP/SEP POC(s) and AFPC Equal Opportunity (T-2). 2.4.3.  The  location  and  contact  point  where  additional  AEP  materials  and  this  Instruction may be reviewed (T-2). AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 17 2.5.  EEO Complaints. 2.5.1.  To    avoid  a  conflict  of  interest,  AEPMs  will  not  serve  as  EO  Specialists  or  EO collateral  duty  counselors  and  are  not  permitted  to  have  direct  involvement  with  the processing of complaints (see also 2.1.1.) (T-1) 2.5.2.  AEPMs  will  maintain  some  awareness  of  bases  and  issues  of  discrimination  claims because such awareness  can pinpoint  possible program  deficiencies which can be  corrected to eliminate underlying causes of complaints (T-1). 2.5.3.  In the event  that an individual contacts  the AEPM regarding a possible complaint of discrimination, the AEPM will immediately refer the individual to the EO office (T-1). 18 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 CHAPTER 3 SPECIAL EMPHASIS PROGRAMS (SEPS) 3.1.  Authorization  for  the  SEPs.  The  SEPs  are  authorized  by  federal  regulation,  29  CFR 1614.102(b)(4),  EEOC  MD  110,  and  by  DoD  Directive  1440.1.,  The  DoD  Civilian  Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Program. 3.2.  Establishment  of  the  SEPs.  This  Instruction  further  authorizes  the  establishment  of  the following six SEPs:  Federal Women’s Program (FWP), Hispanic Employment Program (HEP), Individuals  with  Disabilities (BEP),  Asian American/Pacific  Islander  Employment  Program  (AAEP),  and  the  American  Indian/Alaska Native  Employment  Program  (AIEP).    Although  the  outreach  and  recruitment  mechanisms  for achieving SEP objectives are primarily within the civilian personnel function, the responsibility for accomplishment of program objectives will rest with Air Force management (T-1). (IwDs),  Black  Employment  Program 3.3.  Goals  and  Objectives.  The  AEPM  will  ensure  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  SEPs  are appropriately integrated into all aspects of the installation’s AEP initiatives (T-2). 3.4.  Functional Location of the SEPs.  The SEP is aligned under the AEPM (T-2). 3.4.1.  The SEPMs may be located in an office other than the CPS (i.e., Civil Engineering) as long as the SEP and SEPMs are functioning IAW this AFI (T-2). 3.5.  Appointing the Installation SEPMs. 3.5.1.  SEPMs  are  designated  to  enhance  employment  and  advancement  opportunities  for specific EEO group members; therefore, they can and should play an important role in AEP and  EO  efforts.    The  appointment  of  the  SEPM  is  vital  to  the  success  of  the  program  and should be accomplished based on appropriate criteria related to the performance of the duties (see  Section  3E).    Employees  may  be  the  SEPM  for  any  group  for  which  they  meet  the requirements and possess the necessary knowledge, skills and abilities as outlined below.  It is  not  a  requirement  to  belong  to  the  SEP  group  one  represents  (i.e.  an  employee  does  not have to have a disability to be the DPM) nor be assigned to Civilian Personnel. 3.5.2.  Considering  such  factors  as  organizational  level,  size,  and  composition  of  the workforce,  SEPMs  may  either  volunteer  or  be  assigned  as  full-time  or  collateral  duty appointments.  AEPMs  should solicit from  the base populace for volunteers.  SEPM duties constitute 20 to 24 percent of the assigned duties of the incumbent, when the appointment is collateral.    SEPMs  may  be  military  members,  as  well  as  civilian  employees.    Military members will document their participation as a SEPM consistent with how other “additional duties” are captured for military members (e.g. in EPR, etc.). 3.5.3.  Installations  are  encouraged  to  establish  a  full-time  Disability  Program  Manager (DPM) position due to the lack of representation of individuals with disabilities, in particular, individuals  with  targeted  disabilities,  in  the  federal  workforce.    The  DPM  may  have  other SEPM responsibilities (e.g., FWP or BEP). 3.5.4.  A selection procedure should be established by the AEPM for selecting SEPMs. The process  is  designed  to  ensure  fairness  and  to  evaluate  selectees’  knowledge  and  skills necessary for the position.  Individuals selected should: AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 19 3.5.4.1.  Have good managerial and organization skills. 3.5.4.2.  Be familiar with the basic principles of civilian personnel management. 3.5.4.3.  Be  able  to  identify  and  work  to  resolve  problems  that  affect  the  hiring, advancement, training, treatment, and recognition of individuals on the basis of race, sex, national origin, or disability. 3.5.4.4.  Understand the causes and effects of discrimination. 3.5.4.5.  Function  at  a  level  that  is  sufficiently  responsible  within  the  assigned organization  to  enable  them  to  communicate  effectively  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the program, and obtain the understanding, support, and commitment of managers and other officials at all levels within the organization. 3.6.  SEPMs will: 3.6.1.  Be  officially  appointed  at  each  installation  to  serve  as  the  subject  matter  expert  on various issues affecting barriers to employment based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age, disability, genetic information, or reprisal (See Attachment 2 for Sample Appointment Letter) (T-1).  The overall duty of the installation SEPM  will be to assist managers and supervisors in maintaining a high level of program awareness, provide them  with  proper  advice  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  law  and  provide  assistance  in carrying out their AEP and EEO responsibilities (T-1). 3.6.1.2.  Receive technical program direction from the AEP manager (T-2). 3.6.1.3.  Devote 20-24 percent  of their regular duty time for SEPM collateral  duties  (T-2). 3.6.1.4.  If the SEPM is assigned as a collateral duty, the AEP manager will ensure that: 3.6.2.  The  SEPM  and  the  supervisor  are  in  agreement  regarding  the  SEP  duties,  the  work arrangement,  and  the  time  to  spend  on  the  collateral  duties.    Regardless  of  personal qualifications,  individuals  who  cannot  be  readily  available  to  perform  SEPM  duties  should not be selected. 3.6.3.  SEPMs are appointed for no less than two years, with some exceptions (e.g. military members who change assignments before the two year period ends) (T-2). 3.6.4.  SEPMs should manage no more than two SEPs (T-3). 3.6.5.  Once  selected,  the  collateral  SEPM  should  be  provided  with  managerial  and supervisory support in the performance of those duties and allowed a maximum of 24 percent of his/her duty time to perform them, regardless of the number of SEPs he/she manages (T-2). 3.6.6.  SEPM duties are documented in the employee’s official core personnel document and coded  as  part  of  the  employee’s  current  position  (T-1).    SEPM  must  maintain  acceptable performance in non-SEPM duties (T-3).  Unsatisfactory performance will result in discharge from  the SEPM duties and may result in  corrective action in  accordance  with  AFI-36-1001 (T-2). 3.6.6.1.  An addendum  to  the employee’s official  core personnel  document  will be used to  document  SEPM  collateral  duties.    The  employee’s  supervisor,  employee,  and  the 20 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 AEPM  will  sign  and  date  the  addendum  to  ensure  all  parties  are  in  agreement  (See Attachment 8). 3.6.7.  The AEPM should provide input to the SEPM’s supervisor regarding the performance of the SEPM duties. 3.7.  Appointing  the  Federal  Women’s  Program  Manager  (FWPM).  In  addition  to  the guidelines in 3.5 Appointing the Installation SEPMs, the FWPM should: 3.7.1.  Be familiar with the employment needs and barriers of women as they relate to federal employment policies, practices, and related initiatives. 3.7.2.  Be able to advise management on the status, progress and concerns of women in the installation. 3.8.  Appointing  the  Hispanic  Employment  Program  Manager  (HEPM).  In  addition  to  the guidelines in 3.5 —Appointing the Installation SEPMs, the HEPM should: 3.8.1.  Have  knowledge  of  the  Hispanic  culture  by  experience  or  education  and  be  able  to relate  and  communicate  with  Hispanic  individuals  and  leaders  of  national  and  local organizations and groups. 3.8.2.  Be able to assist, as necessary, candidates or employees, particularly when English is their  second  language.    Proficiency  in  the  Spanish  language  is  not  a  requirement  of  the position. 3.9.  Appointing  the  Disability  Program  Manager  (DPM).  In  addition  to  the  guidelines  in 3.5—Appointing the Installation SEPMs, the DPM should: 3.9.1.  Be  familiar  with  federal  laws,  regulations,  and  policies  that  protect  individuals  with disabilities from discrimination in all employment practices and procedures. 3.9.2.  Be  familiar  with  special  appointing  authorities  available  to  hire  individuals  with disabilities (including Schedule A, 5 CFR 213.3102(u)). 3.9.3.  Be familiar with reasonable accommodation obligations and procedures. 3.9.4.  Be  able  to,  assist  as  necessary,  candidates  or  employees,  and  advise  managers regarding reasonable accommodations. 3.10.  Appointing  the  Black  Employment  Program  Manager  (BEPM).  In  addition  to  the guidelines in 3.5—Appointing the Installation SEPMs, the BEPM should: 3.10.1.  Have knowledge of the Black/African American culture by experience or education and  be  able  to  relate  to  and  communicate  with  Black/African  American  individuals  and leaders of national and local organizations and groups. 3.11.  Appointing  the  Asian  American/Pacific  Islander  Employment  Program  Manager (AAEPM)  (T-2).  In  addition  to  the  guidelines  in  3.5—Appointing  the  Installation  SEPMs,  the AAEPM should: 3.11.1.  Have  knowledge  of  the  Asian  American/Pacific  Islander  culture  by  experience  or education  and  be  able  to  relate  to  and  communicate  with  Asian  American/Pacific  Islanders and leaders of national and local organizations and groups. AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 21 3.12.  American  Indian/Alaska  Native  Employment  Program  Manager  (AIEPM).  In addition to the guidelines in 3.5—Appointing the Installation SEPMs, the AIEPM should: 3.12.1.  Have  knowledge  of  the  American  Indian/Alaska  Native  culture  by  experience  or education  and  be  able  to  relate  to  and  communicate  with  American  Indian/Alaska  Natives and leaders of national and local organizations and groups. 3.13.  Training. 3.13.1.  In  order  to  be  effective,  formal  training  for  newly  appointed  SEPMs  should  be arranged  immediately  upon  selection.    SEPMs  will  attend  the  one-week  SEPM  class conducted by DEOMI, in order to obtain knowledge and skills to serve effectively as SEPMs (T-2).  DPMs will attend the DEOMI Disability Program Management course  (T-2).  Note: These courses are typically centrally funded. 3.13.2.  Other training  can be provided through formal  classroom  instruction  and/or on-the-job  exposure  to  HR  and  EO  operations.    Both  the  AEPM  and  regular  supervisors  should participate in establishing plans for the SEPMs to ensure all job requirements are met. 3.13.3.  Various  conferences  (local,  regional,  and  national)  provide  additional  training sources and are often sponsored by affinity groups and organizations.  If funding is available and  the  training  is  job  related,  attendance  at  these  conferences  is  locally/unit  funded.  Membership  in  these  organizations  is  at  the  SEPMs  discretion  and  usually  includes subscriptions  to  the  organization’s  periodic  publication  that  provide  up-to-date  information on  current  programs,  issues,  and  concerns.  Organization  membership  fees  are  paid  by  the SEPM, not the agency. 3.13.4.  The  DoD  holds  an  employment  forum  during  some  national  conferences.    These forums  provide valuable information  on civilian personnel  issues;  information on the status of all EEO groups and changes in policies and procedures.  Attendees are provided a unique opportunity to hear perspectives from senior level DoD officials and policy makers, receive information  on  national  legislative  issues  affecting  DoD  employees,  and  learn  of  model programs and key initiatives. 3.14.

Develop and support a local Disability Employee Resource Group (T-2). 3.15.11.  Work closely  with  the other installation SEPMs  on issues and problems  related to employees and applicants with disabilities. 3.16.  SEP Committees. 3.16.1.  Each  designated  SEPM  will  establish  a  committee  to  assist  and  support  the individual SEPM, i.e. (T-3): 3.16.1.1.  Federal Women’s Program Committee. 3.16.1.2.  Hispanic Employment Program Committee. 3.16.1.3.  Individuals with Disabilities Committee. 3.16.1.4.  Black Employment Program Committee. 3.16.1.5.

Programs sponsored by the SEP committee will focus on identification and removal of  barriers  to  advancement  and  career  development  based  on  race,  sex,  national  origin,  or disability. 3.16.6.1.  The  SEP  committee  should  establish  a  Special  Emphasis  Program  Resource Allocation  Plan  (SEPRAP)  designed  to  assist  SEPMs  in  outlining  the  amount  of  time, money  and  other  resources  needed  to  identify  program  needs  and  conduct  SEP  related activities  and  events  (T-3).    SEPMs  provide  estimated  total  number  of  hours  required, costs,  and  other  pertinent  information  such  as:  program  objectives,  responsible  officials and  target  dates.    It  is  suggested  to  include  non-monetary  requirements  as  well  (e.g., number  of  work/staff  hours  required  to  plan,  execute  event).    SEPMs  should  be  able  to support the need for the requested funding by explaining the value to and impact of the activities  on  the  installation  and  its  mission.    SEPRAPs  should  be  approved  by  the official  allocating  the  funds  (or  budget  manager)  and  the  AEPM  prior  to  the implementation  of  the  planned  activities.    SEPRAPs  are  a  tool  for  SEPMs,  but  not  a requirement (See sample formats – Attachments 9 & 10). 3.16.7.  The committee  will be established officially by  appropriate memorandum  and have documented  objectives  in  the  appropriate  office  (T-3).    Meetings  will  be  scheduled  on  a regular basis and conducted according to established agenda.  Committee recommendations will be presented to the AEP manager.  Minutes of the meetings should be maintained for the record and distributed, as appropriate. 3.17.  SEPM Responsibilities Regarding EEO Complaints. 3.17.1.  To  avoid  a  conflict  of  interest,  SEPMs  will  not  serve  as  collateral  duty  EEO counselors  or  have  direct  involvement  in  the  processing  of  EEO  complaints  (cannot  be  EO Specialists)(T-2). 3.17.2.  SEPMs  will  maintain  awareness  of  the  bases  (i.e.  race,  age,  disability,  etc.)  and issues  of  discrimination  complaints  because  such  awareness  can  pinpoint  possible  program deficiencies which can be corrected to eliminate underlying causes of complaints (T-2). 3.17.3.  If  an  individual  contacts  a  SEPM  regarding  an  allegation  of  discrimination,  the SEPM will immediately refer the individual to the local EO Office (T-1). 3.18.  Special  Observances.  Special observances are designed to recognize a particular culture or group for their accomplishments  and/or contributions to the Air Force.  Special observances are conducted to enhance cross-cultural awareness as they promote and celebrate the significance of diversity among all military members and civilian employees.  These observances recognize 26 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 the achievements made by members of specific racial, religious, ethnic, and gender groups in our society; as well as, promote mutual respect, understanding, teamwork, harmony, pride and esprit de  corps  among  all  groups.    Participation  in  special  observance  programs  is  voluntary.    These programs  are  designed  to  educate  the  workforce  and  combat  stereotypical  behaviors.  Additionally,  these  activities  are  an  extension  of  human  relations  education  objectives  for maintaining a healthy human relations climate.   Active command support  and leadership  along with thorough planning are key fundamentals for success of the program.   Note: Diversity Day activities must be approved by the Installation commander and will not take place in lieu of those special  observance  months  mandated/proclaimed  by  the  President  of  the  United  States  (T-2).  Special  observances  should  be  conducted  as  installation-wide  activities,  planned  by  an  ad  hoc committee  composed  of  military  members  and  civilian  employees  and  meet  observance objectives and applicable requirements. 3.18.1.  Installation  Commander.    Senior  installation  leadership  support  is  key  to  a successful special observance program. 3.18.2.  The  installation  commander  has  the  authority  to  establish  ad  hoc  committees  to develop awareness programs for each observance. 3.18.3.  In  the  event  a  special  observance  committee  is  not  in  place,  the  installation commander  should  appoint  a  voluntary  working  group  made  up  of  military  members  and civilian employees to plan relevant activities for an observance.  The group composition may include  designated  special  emphasis  program  managers,  chairpersons  of  chartered  ethnic heritage clubs/committees and representatives from staff agencies that normally participate in the  planning  process.  Commanders  may  engage  employee  resource  groups  or  other  base affiliated groups to participate in observance planning. 3.18.4.  The  installation  commander  or  designee  must  approve  administrative  execution  of special observance programs (T-2).  Adequate funding for observance events is an essential element in the success or failure of the programs. 3.18.4.1.  Any  special  observances,  including  heritage  or  history  months,  that  are  not previously approved by law, executive order, DoD or AF policy, will require approval at Headquarters  Air  Force  level  (T-3).    A  current  listing  of  approved  special  observances may be found on the DEOMI website at deomi.org. 3.18.4.1.1.  Requests  for  a  new  special  observance,  as  described  in  paragraph 3.18.4.1.  above,  must  first  be  endorsed  by  the  local  commander  or  designee  and include concurrence at the major command level or equivalent. 3.18.4.1.2.  Requests for a new special observance will be staffed (through the chain of  command)  to  AF/A1Q,  who  will  forward  the  request,  with  a  recommendation  to approve or disapprove, through the chain of command to AF/A1.  Part of this process will include AF/A1Q notifying the applicable program office in DoD. 3.18.5.  Budgetary restrictions must be considered when planning events.  EO program funds cannot  be  utilized  to  finance  special  observance  events.    The  installation  commander  will determine  the  amount  of  installation  funds  to  be  allocated  specifically  towards  special observances (T-2).   See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Section K,  paragraph  4.26.1.  Fundraising  in  an  official  capacity  or  on  duty  time  by  Air  Force personnel  to  supplement  /  augment  the  allocated  official  funds  is  not  permitted.    Where  a AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 27 non-Federal  entity  or  private  organization  expresses  an  interest  (unsolicited  by  Air  Force personnel) in supporting an official event, co-sponsorship pursuant to Section 3-206 of DoD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation, or a gift to the Air Force (pursuant to AFI 51-601) may be permissible.  These groups may also offer to host an event for the Air Force. The servicing legal  office  should  be  contacted  for  advice  and  assistance  in  exploring  these  options.  Fundraising by these groups to raise funds for their contributions toward these events must be unofficial  and  comply  with  AFI  36-3101,  Fundraising  within  the  Air  Force,  and  other fundraising  guidance  and  policies.    See  also,  DOD  5500.7-R,  Joint  Ethics  Regulation,  and AFI  36-3101,  Fundraising  within  the  Air  Force.  The  installation  CC  must  ensure  all budgetary requirements meets applicable guidelines (T-3). 3.18.6.  The AEPM is  responsible for program management, but  not  for special observance event planning.  The AEPM obtains the special observance themes and also ensures special observance  chairpersons  coordinate  all  packages  and  requests  through  the  commander’s designated  POC  prior  to  installation  commander  approval.    The  AEPM  will  ensure  all speaking  points,  articles,  and  related  materials  are  vetted  through  PA  and  approved  by  the installation commander or designee (T-2). 3.18.7.  The  AEPM  will  maintain  a  copy  of  continuity  folders  for  each  special  observance committee (T-2).  The purpose is to provide information for future observances (e.g., copies of calendar of events, flyers, staff summary sheet, programs, etc.). 3.18.8.  AEPMs/SEPMs  will  not  serve  as  chairpersons  of  special  observance  planning committees (T-2).  AEPMs/SEPMs serve as advisors and can participate as members of the installation special observance committees. 3.18.8.1.  Special observances will not be sponsored by AEPMs/SEPMs (T-2).  Activities such  as  fashion  shows,  luncheons,  sporting  events,  dances,  food  tastings,  and  essay contests are not normally appropriate AEP/SEP initiatives. 3.18.8.2.  In  those  instances  where  an  AEPM/SEPM  may  have  involvement  with  the special observance, the activity will be an extension of AEP/SEP (employment related) or EEO education and training objectives (T-2). 3.18.8.3.  AEPMs/SEPMs  should  not  conduct  fund-raising  activities.    Generally,  if official  funds  cannot  be  used  for  an  activity,  the  activity  is  not  appropriate  under  the auspices of the AEP/SEP. 3.19.  Ad Hoc Committees.  AEPMs/SEPMs may serve on an ad hoc committee as a member or as an advisor (T-2).  Advisory duties include: 3.19.1.  Attending committee meetings, as required. 3.19.2.  Providing guidance on appropriateness of the types of events/activities held. 3.19.3.  Reviewing  and  coordinating  on  all  required  publicity  (e.g.  articles,  programs, advertisements, etc.). 3.19.4.  Providing committee(s) with continuity binders/books. 3.19.5.  Advising committee(s) on budgetary limits. 3.19.6.  Reviewing all correspondence prior to the start of the official coordination process. 28 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 3.20.  Special  Observance  Committee  Chairpersons.  The  committee  chairperson  or  private organization  will  coordinate  with  the  AEPM  for  guidance  to  ensure  proper  planning  of  events (T-2).  Chairperson responsibilities include: 3.20.1.  Soliciting a diverse group of Federal employee volunteers to assist with planning and executing observance events. 3.20.2.  Preparing and coordinating all official correspondence. 3.20.3.  Notifying  the  installation  commander  of  proposed  dates/events  where  attendance  is requested at least 30 days in advance. 3.20.4.  Coordinating with Public Affairs, Security Forces, Chaplain, SJA, FM and Protocol offices as appropriate. AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 29 CHAPTER 4 EXEMPTIONS FOR SPECIAL EMPHASIS PROGRAMS (SEPS) 4.1.  Authorization.  The  DoD  Directive  1440.1,  The  DoD  Civilian  Equal  Employment Opportunity  (EEO)  Programs,  authorizes  agency  heads  to  grant  exemptions  for  establishing particular SEPs. 4.1.1.  Approving  Authority.    The  approving  authority  for  granting  waivers  for  establishing SEPs for the Department of Air Force is SAF/MR. 4.2.  Situation. 4.2.1.  An  installation  may  be  geographically  located  in  an  area  where  a  particular  EEO group  is  not  demographically  represented  resulting  in  no  feeder  group  for  outreach  and recruiting.  In this unique situation, an installation may request an exemption. 4.2.2.  Installations  with  499  or  less  APF  and  NAF  civilian  employees  may  determine  an exemption request is appropriate or necessary. 4.3.  Preparing a Request for Waiver/Exemption. 4.3.1.  The process for requesting a waiver for this requirement is found in AFI 33-360, 1.9.5.  Prepare  and  send  a  request  via  e-mail  or  memorandum  to  the  MAJCOM  A1K  for coordination, and in turn, to AFPC Equal Opportunity.  AFPC Equal Opportunity will review and  submit  the  request  with  a  recommendation  to  AF/A1Q.    AF/A1Q  will  either  accept, reject  or  modify  the  recommendation  and  forward  to  SAF/MR  for  final  approval  or  denial and signature (T-1). 4.3.1.1.  NAF will prepare and send a request via e-mail or memorandum to AFASV (T-1). 4.3.2.  The  waiver  request  should  include  the  number  of  permanent,  temporary,  and  NAF civilians  along  with  the  installation’s  demographic  information  broken  out  by  all  EEO groups,  gender,  and  individuals  with  disabilities.    When  reporting  the  EEO  groups,  include their  Relevant  Civilian  Labor  Force  (RCLF)  data.    Note:    There  is  no  comparable  data available for individuals with disabilities. 4.3.2.1.  State whether the installation conducts outreach and recruiting activities and the reason for the request (exemption), as well as a proposed effective/estimated end date for the exemption. 4.3.2.2.  The  request  for  exemption  will  be  signed  by  the  installation  commander  or executive director (T-3). 4.3.2.3.  Issuance of a waiver does not preclude an installation from demonstrating a firm commitment to equality of opportunity for all employees and applicants for employment.  Although  an  installation  may  not  have  certain  SEPs,  the  installation  will  continue  to monitor the status of all EEO groups (as defined in Attachment 1). 30 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 CHAPTER 5 BARRIER ANALYSIS 5.1.  Barrier  Analysis  Obligation.  Section  717  of  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  requires federal  agencies  to  take  proactive  steps  to  ensure  EEO  for  all  employees  and  applicants  for employment.    EEOC  MD-715  interprets  this  to  mean  that  federal  agencies  must  regularly,  at least  annually, evaluate their employment practices to  identify barriers to  equal  opportunity  for all  individuals.    Where  such  barriers  are  identified,  agencies  must  take  measures  to  eliminate them  where  appropriate  and  possible  (T-0).    Note:  Some  barriers  are  necessary  for  mission accomplishment and/or safety and do not require further action. 5.2.  Air Force Barrier Analysis Working Group (AFBAWG). 5.2.1.  The AFBAWG, led by AF/A1Q,  is chartered to identify and, if appropriate, propose elimination of barriers to equal  employment  opportunity in  the Air  Force.   It  is  responsible for analyzing anomalies found in civilian workplace policies, procedures, and practices with an  eye  toward  identifying  their  root  causes,  and,  if  those  root  causes  are  potential  barriers, devising plans to eliminate them.  5.2.1.1.  AFBAWG recommendations are made to senior leaders, MAJCOMs, and other appropriate  decision-makers  at  all  levels.    They  will  also  inform  senior  leadership  of revisions to Air Force policies. 5.2.2.  The  AFBAWG  is  comprised  of  representatives  appointed  by  AF/A1  in  the  EO,  HR, and  other  functional  communities  from  the  HAF,  MAJCOM,  and  installation  levels.  SAF/GCA serves as legal advisor to the AFBAWG.  AF senior leaders volunteer to serve as team champions. 5.2.3.  The AFBAWG shall analyze specific issues, e.g., accommodation of individuals with disabilities; representation at senior grades, in major occupations, and overall workforce. 5.2.4.  The  AFBAWG  shall  work  in  coordination  with  the  MAJCOM/A1s  (the  OPR identified  in  paragraph  1.11.)  as  needed  to  implement  procedural  or  policy  changes  or initiatives. 5.2.5.  The AFBAWG will carry out its work through teams and its charter. 5.2.5.1.  The teams will review and analyze information and data relative to the total Air Force civilian workforce and applicants, in an effort to identify barriers to employment, retention,  advancement,  development  and  inclusion.    This  includes  examining  policies, procedures, educational/training documents, practices, reports and programs. 5.2.5.2.  The  teams  will  make  recommendations  for  changes  and  improvements,  report and follow up accordingly.  The barriers identified by the AFBAWG will be shared with the installations for their further action, as appropriate. 5.2.5.3.  The  teams  usually  focus  on  areas  that  are  identified  in  the  MD-715  report  as barriers  and  work  on  behalf  of  groups  identified  as  underrepresented  or  adversely impacted. AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 31 5.3.  Installation  Barrier  Analysis  Working  Group  (IBAWG).  Installations  with  2,000  or more  civilian  employees  assigned  will  establish  a  barrier  analysis  working  group  made  up  of representatives  from  the  CPS,  NAF-HRS,  EO,  and  other  functional  communities,  along  with other  appropriate  personnel  as  designated  by  the  installation  commander  (or  equivalent)  (T-2).  The installation AEPM will serve as the chairperson for the  IBAWG  (T-3).    For installations with fewer than 2,000 civilians, establishing an IBAWG is optional.  Manning, installation need and resources will be considered by the installation commander when determining if an IBAWG is feasible (T-3). 5.3.1.  The  IBAWG  is  responsible  for  carrying  out  the  barrier  analysis  process  outlined  in this  chapter,  for  its  installation.    In  addition,  the  IBAWG    will  be  charged  with  addressing barriers established by the AFBAWG, to the extent practical and possible (T-1). 5.3.2.  The IBAWG will use data obtained through local means, as well as information made available  by  AFPC  (T-3).    These  tools  should  be  used  as  sources  of  information  for identifying areas that need improvement, as mentioned in the remainder of this chapter. 5.3.3.  The  IBAWG  will  report  its  findings  and  recommendations  to  the  installation commander or designee (T-3). 5.3.4.  Members of the  IBAWG should attend barrier analysis training offered by AF/A1Q, the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI), the EEOC, or other federal agency. 5.3.5.  Each  IBAWG  will  organize  into  functional  teams  that  model  after  the  AFBAWG teams, but not necessarily identical to them (T-3). 5.3.6.  A barrier analysis guide, further detailing the functions of the IBAWG, will be made available and should be used in conjunction with this AFI. 5.4.  Barrier  Analysis.  Barrier  analysis  is  an  investigation  of  anomalies  found  in  workplace policies,  procedures,  and  practices  that  limit  or  tend  to  limit  employment  opportunities  for members of any race or national origin, either sex, or based on an individual’s disability status.  Barrier analysis identifies the root causes of those anomalies, and if necessary, eliminates them. 5.4.1.  The barrier analysis process includes the following steps: 5.4.1.1.  Identify triggers.  See Paragraph 5.5. 5.4.1.2.  Explore root causes of triggers. 5.4.1.3.  Develop action plan. 5.4.1.4.  Implement action plan. 5.4.1.5.  Assess action plan results. 5.4.2.  A  detailed  explanation  of  the  barrier  analysis  process  is  located  in  MD-715 (http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/directives/md715.cfm) and in Section II of the Instructions to Federal Agencies for the MD-715. 5.5.  Triggers.  A  trigger  is  a  trend,  disparity  or  anomaly  that  suggests  the  need  for  further inquiry into a particular employment policy, practice, procedure, or condition. 5.5.1.  How to look for triggers: 32 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 5.5.1.1.  Analyze workforce statistics. 5.5.1.2.  Review EEO complaint trends. 5.5.1.3.  Talk to EO, CPS, Diversity and NAF-HRS staff. 5.5.1.4.  Conduct surveys, focus groups, and exit interviews. 5.5.1.5.  Review studies or reports from outside organizations or agencies. 5.6.  Analysis  and  Interpretation  of  Workforce  Statistics.  The analysis and interpretation  of workforce  statistics  are  the  starting  points  in  the  self-assessment  process  and  often  reveal triggers. 5.6.1.  Workforce  Statistics.    When  reviewing  ethnicity  and  race  identification  (ERI) information/data,  compare the  corresponding participation rates identified in the local MD-715 data tables. internal  participation  rates  with the 5.6.1.1.  Geographic  areas  of  recruiting  and  hiring  are  integral  factors  in  determining participation rates. 5.6.1.2.  With  respect  to  positions  typically  filled  internally  or  through  transfers  from other  federal  agencies,  a  self-assessment  involves  looking  at  the  racial,  national  origin, gender,  and  disability  status  profile  of  the  occupational  categories  and/or  grade  levels from which such promotions or transfers are typically made. 5.6.2.  Statistical analysis is only one part of barrier analysis. 5.6.2.1.  The EEOC, in MD-715, states that “statistics are only a starting point and alone rarely  serve  to  provide  a  complete  picture  of  the  existence  of  workplace  barriers.  Agencies  must  look  at  statistics  in  the  context  of  the  totality  of  the  circumstances.  A statistical snapshot may be useful as an initial diagnostic tool, but conclusions concerning the existence of workplace barriers cannot  be drawn from  gross numerical  assessments.  Rather, the identification of workplace barriers will require a thorough examination of all of the circumstances.” 5.6.2.2.  Example:  If a self-assessment revealed that Hispanics are virtually absent from the workforce, it would be logical for the agency to initially focus attention on its hiring and  recruiting  activities.  The  agency  could  rule  out  potential  recruitment  concerns  if  it determined that Hispanics were well represented among its applicants for employment. It would  then  be  appropriate  for  the  agency  to  examine  all  other  aspects  of  the  hiring process to identify the factor(s) responsible for the statistical disparity. 5.7.  Barrier.  A barrier is a policy, principle, practice, or condition that limits or tends to limit employment opportunities for members of any race or national origin group, either sex, or for an individual (or individuals) based on disability status. 5.7.1.  Barriers  can  be  found  in  the  following  areas  or  policies,  practices  and/or  procedures for: 5.7.1.1.  Recruitment. 5.7.1.2.  Hiring. 5.7.1.3.  Promotions. AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 33 5.7.1.4.  Training and career development. 5.7.1.5.  Performance incentives and awards. 5.7.1.6.  Physical workplace conditions. 5.7.1.7.  Disciplinary actions. 5.7.1.8.  Separations. 5.7.2.  Common barriers for people with targeted disabilities. 5.7.2.1.  Physical barriers: 5.7.2.1.1.  Inadequate or ineffective reasonable accommodation procedures. 5.7.2.1.2.  Lack of compliance with  Architectural  Barriers Act  or Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. 5.7.2.2.  Attitudinal barriers: 5.7.2.2.1.  Persistence  of  myths  and  stereotypes  pertaining  to  capabilities  of individuals with disabilities 5.7.2.3.  Structural barriers: 5.7.2.3.1.  Complex hiring process. 5.7.2.3.2.  Failure to utilize special hiring authorities. 5.7.3.  Barrier  analysis  working  groups  should  make  use  of  the  attached  Model  Report  of Barrier Identification or similar form. (Attachment 5) 5.7.4.  While  MD-715  limits  barrier  analysis  to  race,  national  origin,  sex,  and  disability, barrier analysis need not be so limited.  A barrier is a policy, principle, practice, or condition that  limits  or  tends  to  limit  employment  opportunities  for  individuals  based  on  any  of  the characteristics,  experiences  and  abilities  found  in  the  Air  Force  definition  of  diversity  (see AFI 36-7001, Diversity).  All levels of the Air Force, both civilian and military, are required to identify, analyze and report barriers to diversity as that term is broadly defined in the Air Force  (T-0).  Reporting  on barrier analysis outside the categories set  forth in  Para 5.7 (and MD-715) should take place outside the MD-715 reporting path. 5.8.  Plan to Eliminate Barriers. 5.8.1.  Form a working hypothesis. 5.8.1.1.  The identification of barriers that occurs during the course of a barrier analysis investigation  is  conditional  only.    It  is  nothing  more  than  a  conjecture,  and  remains  a working hypothesis until it can be tested by developing and implementing an action plan.  It  is  only  after  the  results  of  the  action  plan  are  evaluated  that  a  determination  can  be made as to whether the policy, practice, procedure, or condition dealt within the plan is, in fact, a barrier. 5.8.2.  The Action Plan. 5.8.2.1.  Design  and  implement  corrective  plan  to  address  the  identified  causes  of barriers. 34 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 5.8.2.2.  Even if the barrier is job related, explore alternatives that serve the same purpose and  have less impact on a particular group of employees. 5.8.2.3.  Progress should be measurable and agency officials accountable. 5.8.2.4.  Periodic reassessments should be conducted to adjust plan if necessary. 5.8.2.5.  Report plan and progress annually to the installation commander. 5.8.2.6.  Use  the  attached  Model  Report  of  Barrier  Removal  Plan  or  similar  form.  (Attachment 5) 5.9.  Assessing  Results.  Indicators  of  success  may  be  revealed  in  higher  participation  rates, lower separation rates, fewer complaints, more favorable survey responses, etc. 5.9.1.  If the plan is unsuccessful, then: 5.9.1.1.  The wrong barrier was identified; or 5.9.1.2.  The action gave rise to a new barrier; or 5.9.1.3.  There was not a barrier. 5.9.2.  Generally, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to assess the results of an action plan after only one reporting cycle.  However, after two or more consecutive cycles, trends in one direction or the other should begin to become apparent.  The process is an ongoing one. 5.10.  Reassessments.  Periodic reassessments should be done to see whether action plan needs adjustment. 5.11.  Report.  Report plan and progress annually to the installation commander. 5.12.  Barrier Analysis Scorecard. 5.12.1.  To emphasize the fundamental importance at all Air Force levels of establishing and maintaining a strong program of equal opportunity, each program is reviewed and then rated annually  on  its  barrier  identification  and  removal.    Success  in  this  element  is  measured  by commanders’  support,  the  activity  of  the  IBAWG  and  the  progress  and  results  of  ongoing efforts to identify and where appropriate, eliminate any barriers to equality of opportunity.  A key  to  program  success  is  the  technical  competency  to  initiate  meaningful  barrier  analysis.  These efforts are essential to a compliant program, because the goal of the EO program is to ensure equality in opportunities for all individuals, not parity or proportional representation. 5.12.2.  Program  status  is  typically  assessed  as  follows:  green  (on-track),  yellow  (with deficiencies but making progress), or red (non-compliant). AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 35 CHAPTER 6 AFFIRMATIVE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM (AEP) REPORTS AND BEST PRACTICES 6.1.  Disabled Veterans Affirmative Action Program (DVAAP). 6.1.1.  The agency DVAAP responsibilities are covered in Title 5 of CFR, Part 720, subpart C, and  38 United States Code, Section 4214. 6.1.2.

The overriding objective of the MD-715 is to ensure that all employees and applicants for employment enjoy equality of opportunity in the federal workforce regardless of race, sex (including  pregnancy),  national  origin,  color,  religion,  disability  or  reprisal  for  engaging  in prior protected activity. 6.3.4.  Reporting requirements: 6.3.4.1.  Agency.  The Air Force submits an annual MD-715 report to EEOC.  Program status  is  assessed annually by  AF/A1Q.   These assessments are shared  with the Deputy Chief of Staff, Manpower, Personnel & Services (AF/A1) and the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR) (T-0). 6.3.4.2.  MAJCOM.  The MAJCOMs are responsible for oversight and accountability of those  installation  barrier  analysis  activities.    Therefore,  MAJCOM  AEP  Strategic Advisors or POCs are responsible for compiling the MD-715 reports listed in 6.3.4.3.1.1. and forwarding to AFPC Equal Opportunity.  For each part listed below each MAJCOM will submit one comprehensive command report that reflects the input received from their subordinate  installations.    These  reports  are  due  to  AFPC  Equal  Opportunity  by  1 November of each year. 6.3.4.3.  Installation. 6.3.4.3.1.  All installation commanders will be responsible for regulatory compliance regarding Affirmative Employment Programs, consistent with applicable laws, EEOC regulations,  DoD  directives  and  AF  guidance  (T-0).    Installations  will  submit required reports to the parent MAJCOM (T-2). 6.3.4.3.1.1.  The installations will complete Part G, Self-Assessment Checklist, of the  MD-715  report  (T-2).    Installations  with  fewer  than  500  civilians  assigned must submit  the checklist  upon request  only  (T-2).   Installations with  more than AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 37 500  civilian  employees  assigned  will  complete  and  submit  Part  G,  and,  if discrepancies  (No’s)  are  identified,  Part  H,  EEO  Plan  to  Attain  the  Essential Elements  of  a  Model  EEO  Program  (T-2).    Installations  with  1,000  to  1,999 assigned  civilians  will  complete  Parts  G,  H,  and  J,  Special  Program  for  the Recruitment,  Hiring  and  Advancement  of  Individuals  with  Targeted  Disabilities (T-2).  Installations with 2,000 or more assigned civilians will complete all of the following  MD-715  parts,  for  locally  established  (IBAWG)  and/or  AFBAWG identified barriers (Part H and I) (T-1): 6.3.4.3.1.1.1.

Other Responsibilities. 6.4.1.  AEPMs  are  responsible  for  keeping  leadership  informed  of  issues  and  trends pertaining  to  the  AEP/SEP  at  their  respective  locations.    This  was  formerly  known  as  the Installation EEO Committee.  While a formal EEO committee is no longer required, in order to execute the responsibility of keeping commanders apprised of the status of the programs, AEPMs  must  meet,  at  least  semi-annually,  with  the  installation  commander  to  provide AEP/SEP program updates, complete with progress reports, recommendations, data, analysis and trends (T-2). 6.4.1.1.  The meetings should include discussions of pertinent issues/concerns relative to the  AEP/SEPs,  such  as  initiatives  requiring  higher  level  support  and  attention,  or  local matters/events that may impact the installation, etc. The meeting logistics/specific agenda content  and  attendees  are  at  the  discretion  of  the  local  parties  (commander  and  AEPM) and  may  vary  from  meeting  to  meeting.    Representatives  from  the  community,  special interest groups, management officials or other stakeholders may be invited and take part in  the  meetings,  if  it  is  deemed  appropriate/necessary  or  otherwise  required.    It  is recommended that minutes be kept and an agenda be established for each meeting. 6.5.  Best Practices. 6.5.1.  Within  the  Air  Force,  a  best  practice  is  defined  as  a  management  idea  which  asserts there  is  a  technique,  method,  process,  activity,  incentive  or  reward  more  effective  at delivering a particular outcome than any other technique. 6.5.2.  It  is  also  defined  as  the  most  efficient  (least  amount  of  effort)  and  effective  (best results)  way  of  accomplishing  a  task,  based  on  repeatable  procedures  that  have  proven themselves over time for large numbers of people. 38 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 6.5.3.  The  goal  of  identifying  a  best  practice  is  to  highlight  successful  models  that  can  be reviewed and adapted in whole or in part by other organizations.  When determining if you have a best practice to submit, consider the following criteria: 6.5.4.  It was successful over time. 6.5.4.1.  It produced quantitative and/or qualitative results. 6.5.4.2.  It  developed  recognized  or  recognizable  positive  outcomes  including  customer satisfaction or some type of definitive positive impact. 6.5.4.3.  It is ground-breaking, new, or innovative. 6.5.4.4.  With  modifications,  it  can  be  replicated  and/or  transferable  to  another organization. 6.5.4.5.  It adds value by improving service, quality, and/or productivity. 6.5.4.6.  It is meaningful to users of the best practice. 6.5.4.7.  Best  practice  organizations  value  people  and  cultivate  an  environment  where sensitivity,  fairness,  and  integrity  prosper.    When  submitting  a  best  practice,  use  the following format: 6.5.4.7.1.  Name  of  Best  Practice:    Should  give  the  reader  a  clear  picture  of  the superior  method  or  innovative  practice  that  contributed  to  improved  performance  of the process.  Good examples are: Science & Engineering Career Field team selections made  from  national  recruiting  events,  the  Workforce  Recruitment  Program  for students with disabilities helped to convert three students into permanent positions. 6.5.4.7.2.  Name  of  Process:    Should  identify  the  general  activity  where  the  best practice  is  found.    Good  examples  are:  institute  diversity  outreach  efforts,  lead implementation of innovative workforce shaping, provide training. 6.5.4.7.3.  Date Implemented:  Self-explanatory. 6.5.4.7.4.  MAJCOM/DRU/FOA:  Self-explanatory. 6.5.4.7.5.  Point of Contact:  Enter the person’s name, duty title, phone number (DSN and commercial), organization/office symbol, and location (base, state, and zip code).  May  be  a supervisor or  anyone knowledgeable of the best  practice  and permitted to share it outside the process owner’s organization. 6.5.4.7.6.  Process Owner:  Enter the person’s name, duty title, phone number (DSN and commercial), organization/office symbol, and location (base, state, and zip code).  Defined as the person who coordinates the various functions and work activities at all levels  of  a  process,  has  the  authority  or  ability  to  make  changes  in  the  process  as required,  and  manages  the  process  end-to-end  so  as  to  ensure  optimal,  overall performance.  Flight, branch, and division chiefs; squadron, group, installation /center commanders (directors) are good examples of process owners. 6.5.4.7.7.  Summary of Best Practice:  Give an overview of what makes the practice superior.  Describe how the best practice works and how it is measured.  This entry is limited to one page to include the impact or result (single-spaced, Times New Roman, 12 pitch).  When reporting numbers, e.g., “we hired 40 interns,” indicate the number AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 39 of males, females, and the number of specific EEO groups involved (Black, Hispanic, Asian, White females, etc.). 6.5.4.7.8.  Impact  of  the  Best  Practice:    The  impact  on  process/organization performance (results) MUST be included in the summary of the best practice. Impact or  result  may  include:  increased  representation  of  specific  EEO  groups,  improved return on investment, reduction in costs. 6.5.4.7.9.  Additional Information to Help Determine How the Practice Qualified as a Best Practice:  “Best” may be based on several factors to include but not limited to:  expert review (for example: assessment or award), results are clearly superior to those of  comparative  organizations,  results  are  “breakthrough”  in  efficiency/effectiveness (high return on investment), multiple sources the practice is superior, use of the latest technology or high number of satisfied managers and supervisors. Good examples of entries  are: the to  practices  of  other installation/center  commander organizations or as being a breakthrough in efficiency. identified  during  a  Staff  Assistance  Visit,  determined  by (director)  as  superior 6.6.  Reporting Requirements. 6.6.1.  Installation  best  practices  are  due  annually  to  AFPC  Equal  Opportunity  NLT  30 September or upon request.  Best practice submission is optional and should be based on the above outlined criteria. 40 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 CHAPTER 7 AFFIRMATIVE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM (AEP) AWARD 7.1.  AEP  Award.  The  AEP  award  replaced  the  Air  Force  Distinguished  Equal  Employment Opportunity  Award  (formerly  AFI  36-2866,  Distinguished  Equal  Employment  Opportunity Awards).  Commanders are highly encouraged to recognize employees meeting the criteria of the AEP Award program.  Nomination packages must meet prescribed guidelines. 7.2.  Purpose of the Award.  The AEP award recognizes civilian personnel for their significant contributions  to  further  AEP  objectives.    Military  members  performing  SEPM  duties  and/or serving as a Commander are also eligible for the AEP award.  The AEP award provides visibility for  the  Air  Force  programs  and  affords  senior  leaders  an  opportunity  to  publicly  support  AEP objectives. 7.3.  Award  Nomination  Procedures.  The  AEP  award  is  listed  in  the  A1  Awards  Program Guide under the A1 Community Awards.  HQ USAF/A1 will send a message to solicit AEP and SEP award nominations.  Each award will be submitted through approved channels to AF/A1Q using  the  most  current  version  of  Air  Force  Form1206,  Nomination  for  Award.    Check  the specific requirements for each award for headings and maximum number of lines.  In nominating individuals, commanders and directors should perform a quality force review. 7.3.1.  Ensure nominations are factual and that nominees are not under investigation, have no recent disciplinary actions, nor are involved in activities that would bring discredit to the Air Force. 7.3.2.  Individuals  may  only  be  nominated  for  one  separate  category  (i.e.,  the  same  person cannot be nominated under the Affirmative Employment Program Category and the Special Emphasis Program Category). 7.3.2.1.  Additional Nomination Guidance: 7.3.2.1.1.  Joint Commands:  Nominations for personnel assigned to a joint command are submitted to AFDW/A1. 7.3.2.1.2.  Tenant Units:  Award nominations for personnel assigned to  a tenant unit on  an  installation  hosted  by  another  MAJCOM  are  submitted  to  their  parent MAJCOM. 7.3.2.1.3.  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  (ARC)  Units:    Award  nominations  for personnel  assigned  to  an  ARC  unit  are  submitted  through  the  Air  Force  Reserve Command  (ARC).      ARC  members  assigned  to  a  RegAF  unit  are  also  submitted  to ARC. 7.4.  Eligibility Requirements. 7.4.1.  Eligibility include  military  and  civilian  personnel  who  have demonstrated  leadership  and  commitment  to  furthering  AEP  objectives.    Ensure  nominees have made significant contributions in support of one of the categories defined below see 7.5. requirements AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 41 7.4.2.  At the time of nomination, individuals must have been in their position for at least six months (T-1).  Military nominees must be on active duty status or active reserve status and civilian nominees must be current Air Force employees (T-1). 7.4.3.  Previous year award recipients are not normally nominated two years in succession.  If an  organization  submits  a  previous  year  nomination,  the  justification  must  highlight  the additional  contributions  in  furthering  AEP  and  SEP  objectives  beyond  the  first  year’s nomination. 7.4.4.  The specific period of service for the AEP award is 1 October through 30 September. 7.5.  Categories. 7.5.1.  Commander/Director Leadership Support. 7.5.2.  Affirmative Employment Program Management. 7.5.3.  Special Emphasis Program Management. 7.5.4.  Individuals with Disabilities Program Management. 7.6.  Description and Criteria. 7.6.1.  Commander/Director  Leadership  Support  Category:    This  category  is  designed  for military  commanders  or  civilian  leaders—MAJCOM,  FOA,  Direct  Reporting  Unit, intermediate  command,  and  center,  wing,  base,  or  tenant  organization.    Ensure  nominees have  demonstrated  personal  commitment  to  AEP  and  EO  objectives  and  goals  for  people with targeted disabilities through identification and removal of barriers to equal employment opportunity  and  results-oriented  management.   Nominees  must  have  demonstrated leadership, commitment, and support for the SEPs. 7.6.2.  Affirmative  Employment  Program  Category.    This  category  is  designed  for  civilian and  military  personnel,  AEP  managers,  and  human  resource  specialists.    Nominees  must have  clearly  demonstrated  superior  abilities  in  attaining  the  Air  Force  affirmative employment  objectives  and    goals  for  people  with  targeted  disabilities  by  assisting leadership, managers, and supervisors in their efforts to take proactive steps to ensure EEO for  all  employees  and  applicants  for  employment,  by  regularly  evaluating  employment practices to identify and eliminate barriers that hamper the advancement of any individual on the basis of race, national origin, sex (including pregnancy) or disability. 7.6.3.  Special  Emphasis  Program  Category.    This  category  is  designed  for  civilian  and military  personnel  who  have  contributed  significantly  to  the  employment  and  advancement opportunities  for  all  EEO  groups.    Ensure  nominees  have  clearly  demonstrated  their contributions through training programs, effective outreach and recruitment activities, barrier removal  for  EEO  groups,  positive  management  and  community  involvement.    Nominees must  have  clearly  demonstrated  their  contributions  through  measurable  accomplishments toward attaining the Air Force affirmative employment objectives.  This category covers the FWP, HEP, BEP, AAEP, and AIEP. 7.6.3.1.  Special observance activities are not included in the SEP category criteria. 7.6.4.  Individuals with Disabilities Program Category.  This category is designed for civilian and  military  personnel  who  have  contributed  significantly  to  the  employment  of  and advancement opportunities for individuals with  disabilities, including disabled veterans and 42 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 Wounded Warriors.  Ensure nominees have clearly demonstrated their contributions through training  programs,  effective  outreach  and  recruitment  activities,  barrier  removal  for individuals  with  disabilities,  positive  management  and  community  involvement.    Nominees must  have  clearly  demonstrated  their  contributions  through  measurable  accomplishments toward  attaining  the  Air  Force  affirmative  employment  objectives  and  the  goals  for  people with targeted disabilities. 7.6.5.  Since  the  recipients  represent  the  Air  Force  and  serve  as  role  models  for  others,  the selection board review process and the final selection should focus on program management, creative use of resources, and demonstrated accomplishments. 7.6.6.  The criteria for the Air Force AEP awards is consistent with the Air Force policy that it  does  not  tolerate    unlawful  discrimination  or  harassment  based  on    race,  color,  religion, sex,  national  origin,  age,  disability,  genetic  information  or  prior  EEO  activity  (reprisal).  Therefore, an individual does not have to be a member of any particular race, color, religion, national  origin,  age,  or  sex,  or  have  a  disability  in  order  to  be  eligible  for  any  AEP  award.  Nor does an individual’s race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or disability play a role in winning the award. 7.7.  Presentation.  Upon  selection  of  the  award  recipients,  AF/A1  will  forward  an  email message to the field announcing winners. 7.7.1.  AFPC/DPSIDR will forward appropriate award elements to award recipients through their respective chain-of-command (T-1). AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 43 CHAPTER 8 REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION OF DISABILITY 8.1.  1.  This  chapter  covers  all  Air  Force  employees,  regardless  of  type  and  duration  of appointment,  and  all  applicants  for  employment  with  the  Air  Force.    It  also  provides  limited coverage  for  certain  temporary  service  employees.    Contractor  personnel  should  refer  to reasonable accommodation procedures established by their contracting employer.  The Air Force may,  in  certain  situations,  have  a  joint  obligation  with  the  contractor  to  provide  reasonable accommodation to contractor personnel.  The provision of reasonable accommodation outlined in this chapter applies only to qualified individuals with disabilities. 8.1.2.  The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC §791 et seq.) as amended by the Americans with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA)  of  1990,  as  amended  (42  USC  §12101  et  seq.)  requires  all federal  agencies  to  provide  reasonable  accommodation  to  qualified  individuals  with disabilities  who  are  employees  or  applicants  for  employment,  unless  to  do  so  would  cause undue hardship. 8.1.3.  In  general,  an  accommodation  is  any  change  in  the  work  environment  or  in  the  way things  are  customarily  done  that  enables  an  individual  with  a  disability  to  enjoy  equal employment opportunities (29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 app. § 1630.2(o)). 8.1.4.  Disability Accommodation is a case-specific and fact-specific process.  The EEOC’s “Enforcement  Guidance:  Reasonable  Accommodation  and  Undue  Hardship  Under  the Americans 2002 (http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html)  provides  regulatory  guidance  on this  issue.    Whether  an  individual  is  a  qualified  individual  with  a  disability  is  ultimately  a legal issue and thus, when questions arise, the servicing legal office should be consulted. Disabilities dated with Act” October 17, 8.2.  Definitions. 8.2.1.  Individual  with  a  Disability  (IWD)—A  person  who  has  a  physical  or  mental impairment  that  substantially  limits  one  or  more  major  life  activities,  has  a  record  of  such impairment, or is regarded as having an impairment (regardless of whether or not it limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity). 8.2.2.  Qualified Individual with a Disability— An individual with a disability, who satisfies the  requisite  skill,  experience,  education  and  other  job-related  requirements  of  the employment position such individual holds or desires, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position. 8.2.2.1.  An  individual  “regarded  as”  having  such  an  impairment  is  not  entitled  to reasonable accommodation. 8.2.3.  Exceptions to the definition of “ Individual with a Disability” 8.2.3.1.  Non-coverage  -  The  term    individual  with  a  disability  does  not  include individuals currently engaging in  the use of illegal  drugs when an employer  acts  on the basis  of  such  use.    Nor  does  it  include  the  following  sexual  and  behavioral  disorders:  transvestism,    transsexualism,  pedophilia,  exhibitionism,  voyeurism,  gender  identity disorders  not  resulting  from  physical  impairments,  or  other  sexual  behavior  disorders; 44 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 compulsive  gambling,  kleptomania,  or  pyromania;  or  psychoactive  substance  use disorders resulting from  current illegal use of drugs.  In addition, tests for use of illegal drugs  are  not  considered  medical  examinations  and,  therefore,  are  not  subject  to  the restrictions  on  medical  examinations  imposed  by  the  Rehabilitation  Act  and  the  ADA.  An employer does not have to employ an individual with a disability who poses a direct threat to the health or safety of him/herself or of others in the workplace. 8.2.4.  Reasonable  Accommodation—Any  modification  or  adjustment job,  an employment  practice,  or  the  work  environment  that  enables  a  qualified  individual  with  a disability to enjoy equal employment opportunities. to  a 8.2.4.1.  Reasonable accommodation may include, but is not limited to: 8.2.4.1.1.  Making  existing  facilities  used  by  employees  readily  accessible  to  and usable by individuals with disabilities; 8.2.4.1.2.  Job restructuring, modifying work schedules, or reassignment of a current employee to a vacant position; and 8.2.4.1.3.  Acquiring  or  modifying  equipment  or  devices,  adjusting  or  modifying examinations,  training  materials,  or  policies,  and  providing  qualified  readers  or interpreters. 8.2.4.2.  Reasonable accommodations are not limited to items that permit the employee to perform the essential functions of the job. 8.2.4.3.  An  employer  is  not  obligated  to  provide  personal  use  items  such  as  glasses  or hearing aids. 8.2.4.4.  An  employer  is  not  required  to  remove  an  essential  function  of  the  job  as  a reasonable  accommodation. 8.2.4.5.  An  employer  shall  hold  employees  with  disabilities  to  the  same  standards  of performance and conduct as other similarly situated employees without disabilities.  An employee  with  a  disability  is  expected  to  meet  the  same  production  standards,  whether quantitative  or  qualitative,  as  a  non-disabled  employee  in  the  same  job.    Lowering  or changing a production standard because an employee cannot meet it due to a disability is not considered a reasonable accommodation. 8.2.5.  Undue Hardship—Employers do not have to provide any accommodation that would pose  an  undue  hardship  on  the  operation  of  the  agency.    Undue  hardship  focuses  on  the resources and circumstances of the particular employer in relationship to the cost or difficulty of  providing  a  specific  accommodation  and  refers  to  reasonable  accommodations  that  are unduly  extensive,  substantial,  or  disruptive,  or  those  that  would  fundamentally  alter  the nature or operation of the business or organization. 8.2.5.1.  When considering whether the expense of a potential accommodation constitutes an undue hardship, the budget of the entire agency, i.e., the Air Force as a whole, is to be taken into account. 8.2.6.  Interactive  Process—An  interactive  communication  process  with  an  employee  who has  requested  an  accommodation  (or  otherwise  indicated  a  need)  in  order  to  clarify  the specific nature of the disability and identify the appropriate reasonable accommodation.  This AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 45 may include asking relevant questions that enables the supervisor or management official to make  an  informed  decision  regarding  Air  Force’s  accommodation  responsibilities  in  a specific situation. 8.3.

Assign  responsibility  to  an  appropriate  personnel  specialist  for  assessment  of qualification  determinations  and  review  of  available  position  options  for  qualified disabled employees when reassignment / change to a lower grade is being considered as a possible  reasonable  accommodation  when the  employee  cannot  be  reasonably accommodated within the job/position occupied (T-3). 46 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 8.3.2.5.  Designate  a  specific  individual  to  serve  as  the  Base  Point  of  Contact  for  the AFPC Injury Compensation (IC) Office (T-3).   Supervisors and injured workers (or their representative)  who  require  modified  duty  due  to  an  accepted  federal  work  injury  are referred  to  the  AFPC/IC  Office  and  provided  AFPC/IC  POC  information;  i.e.,  Total Force Support  Center (TFSC) Tier 1 Phone number  – 1-800-525-0102;  AFPC/IC  group email: address:  HQ AFPC/DP2SSC, 550 C Street West, JBSA Randolph  TX  78150.

Supervisors and Managers will: 8.3.3.1.  Work  in  consultation  with  the  local  CPS/NAF-HRS,  DPM  and,  when appropriate, the servicing legal office, in the receipt, review, and determination process in response  to  an  employee’s  reasonable  accommodation  request,  and  participate  in  the interactive process concerning potential reasonable accommodation (T-3). 8.3.3.2.  Within 10 business days, provide the employee an initial response confirming (a) receipt of the accommodation request; (b) whether additional information is needed; and (c) that the interactive process has been initiated (T-1). 8.3.3.3.  Initiate  and  facilitate  the  interactive  process  for  the  purpose  of  consulting  and sharing information with an employee requesting reasonable accommodation (T-2). 8.3.3.4.  Ensure  that  the  essential  functions  of  a  position  are  identified  and  documented appropriately (T-3). 8.3.3.5.  Request medical documentation in consultation with CPS, DPM and legal office, only  when  the  disability  or  need  for  reasonable  accommodation  is  not  obvious  (T-0).  Supervisors  and  Managers  will  use  this  documentation  to  determine  if  the  employee requesting  reasonable  accommodation  is  a  qualified  individual  with  a  disability,  to AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 47 identify  functional  limitations  and  to  determine  appropriate  accommodations  (see  8.7. Medical Documentation) (T-0). 8.3.3.6.  Budget for accommodation (T-2). equipment and/or services associated  with reasonable 8.3.3.6.1.  In  general,  each  organization  will  bear  the  cost  of  providing  reasonable accommodations  (T-2).    Organizations  may  use  centrally-funded  accommodations monies in fiscal years in which such a centrally-funded account is funded. 8.3.3.6.2.  Make  use  of  free  job  accommodation  resources  such  as  the  DoD’s Computer/Electronic  Accommodation  Program  (CAP),  and  the  Department  of Labor’s Job Accommodation Network (JAN). 8.3.3.7.  Within  30  business  days,  except  as  provided  in  paragraph  8.5,  act  upon  an employee’s  request  for  reasonable  accommodation  in  consultation  with  the  CPS,  DPM and  legal  office;  secure  appropriate  concurrences  and  provide  the  employee  with  a written  response  (T-1).    Supervisors  and  managers  must  ensure  that  if  the  request  for reasonable  accommodation  is  denied,  the  response  has  been  coordinated  with  the organizational  commander,  DPM  and  CPS  or  NAF-HRS,  and  as  appropriate  the  SJA, prior  to  issuance,  and    includes  the  specific  reason(s)  for  denial,  why  there  were  no alternative accommodations that could be made, notification of the right to file an appeal or EEO complaint, options for alternative dispute resolution, and the contact point for the filing of the formal complaint (T-2).  (See 8.9., Denial of Reasonable Accommodations) 8.3.3.8.  Consult  with  the  installation  DPM/CPS,  MAJCOM  POC  and  SJA  in  making reasonable  accommodation  determinations  (T-2).

In situations where an employee is on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), the  supervisor  will  ensure  that  all  reasonable  accommodations  necessary  to  meet  the requirements of the PIP are made available to the employee (T-3).  However, lowering or changing a performance standard because an employee cannot meet it due to a disability is not considered a reasonable accommodation. 8.3.3.13.  Supervisors  and  Managers  will  ensure  compliance  with  safety  laws  and regulations, including accessible emergency egress route or an area of rescue assistance, 48 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 thus providing a workplace free from recognizable safety and health hazards, proactively engaging in and supporting accident and illness prevention (T-3). 8.3.4.  Employees or Applicants will: 8.3.4.1.  Consult and cooperate with the appropriate agency representative in an effort to reach a reasonable accommodation solution (T-3).  This requires the employee to: 8.3.4.1.1.  When  requested,  obtain  from  their  personal  physician,  or  provide  the physician  an  authorization  to  release  specific  medical  or  related  information pertaining their manager/supervisor  and/or  other  authorized  Air  Force  official(s)  so  that  the  request may be properly evaluated; for  accommodation  and  provide request  to to the it 8.3.4.1.2.

When  requested,  provide  an  updated  resume  for  an  assessment  of qualifications  for  use  in  placement  activities  associated  with  reassignment  as  an accommodation.    Timeframes  for  submitting  information  may  vary.    The  employee will be notified at the time of the specific request as to when the information is due to management for consideration. 8.3.5.  Civil Engineering will: 8.3.5.1.  Ensure that all Air Force owned and leased facilities are in compliance with the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) of October 31, 2008 and the Rehabilitation Act (T-0).  This  will  entail  accommodating  a  qualified  disabled  applicant  or  employee  in  areas relating to building facilities, unless the accommodation requested would create an undue hardship  on  the  Air  Force  as  a  whole.    Responsibility  may  include  coordinating  with contractor  agencies  in  cases  of  building  or  facility  modifications  affecting  Air  Force owned  or  leased  facilities,  and  coordinating  with  installation  CPS  in  the evaluation  and provision  of  equipment  or  furniture  associated  with  approved  accommodation  requests.

Consult and share information with the CPS specifically under conditions where safety of the employee, other employees or the public is a concern (T-3). 8.3.7.  AF Health Care Provider (AF HCP)/Occupational Medicine will: 8.3.7.1.  Assist  CPS  or  NAF-HRS  to  determine  if  the  requested  accommodation  is reasonable and effective only in situations where the need for the accommodation is not obvious  and  the  employee  has  not  provided  sufficient  documentation  to  justify  the requested  reasonable  accommodation  (T-3).    In  this  event,  CPS  or  NAF-HRS  may request  an  AF  Health  Care  Provider  (AF  HCP)  opinion  regarding  a  civilian  federal employee’s request for reasonable accommodation if one of the following is available at the  servicing  medical  treatment  facility:    a  dedicated  Occupational  Medicine  Services clinic or a dedicated AF HCP who is privileged to provide the requested opinion and the AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 49 medical treatment facility commander determines the clinic has the resources to support this activity (T-2). 8.3.7.1.1.  If the Air Force determines the evidence provided by a civilian employee is insufficient to justify the need for a requested accommodation, the AF may offer the employee an appointment for a medical assessment (at no cost to the employee) to be provided  by  an  AF  HCP.    Refusal  of  the  assessment  or  failure  to  comply  with  a scheduled  appointment  for  assessment  may  impact  the  AF  decision  regarding  the employee’s request for accommodation.  If an employee occupies a position that has medical standards or physical requirements or which is part of an established medical evaluation program, the Air Force may order a medical examination. 8.3.7.1.2.  Any  medical  assessment  conducted  by  the  AF  HCP  for  the  purpose  of determining  reasonable  accommodation  must  be  job-related  and  consistent  with business  necessity  (T-0).    This  means  that  the  assessment  is  limited  to  determining the  existence  of  impairment  and  the  possible  need  for  accommodation  of  functional limitations relative to a specific job or position. 8.3.7.1.3.  The  CPS  or  NAF-HRS  assists  the  supervisor,  who  is  responsible  for determining if a reasonable accommodation can be made.  Determining the ultimate propriety of a request for reasonable accommodation is a managerial and legal matter, not  a medical  one.   It  may  be  appropriate to  consult with  the local JA office in  this process. 8.3.8.  AFPC will: 8.3.8.1.  Provide  contact  information  in  each  job  announcement  for  requests  from applicants for reasonable accommodations necessary to complete the application process (T-2). 8.3.8.1.1.  Designate  an  individual  to  be  responsible  for  working  with  the  relevant CPS  to  ensure  that  required  reasonable  accommodation  is  made  for  requesting applicants  to  ensure that they  can complete the application process.    In many  cases, this is the installation DPM . 8.3.8.1.2.  Designate an individual to serve as chairperson or active participant for the local Federal Employee Compensation Act (FECA) Working Group and attend Office of Safety and Health Act (OSHA) scheduled meetings (T-2). 8.3.9.  Training 8.3.9.1.  The requirement to provide reasonable accommodation in training applies to all Air Force sponsored or required training in-house or by outside contractor, and whether provided  on  or  off  Air  Force  property.    If  the  training  is  provided  outside  Air  Force property,  the  Air  Force  has  a  joint  legal  obligation  with  the  outside  entity  to  provide reasonable accommodations. 8.3.9.2.  Civilian Training Office and/or Force Development Flight will: 8.3.9.2.1.  Identify  the  process  to  request  reasonable  accommodation  and  provide advice  and  guidance  to  employees  requesting  reasonable  accommodation  to participate in AF-sponsored training and development programs (T-3). 50 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 8.3.9.2.2.  Receive  initial  requests  for  reasonable  accommodation  from  employees, when  submitted  directly  to  the  Office  in  response  to  a  training  application  or invitation.    In  addition,  the  Office  will  process  requests  submitted  to  supervisors  by employees in relation to training or development programs. (T-1). 8.3.9.2.3.  Forward  employees’  requests  for  reasonable  accommodation  to  the appropriate training manager/point of contact (T-3). 8.3.9.2.4.  Advise  individuals  selected  to  participate  in  a  training  activity,  course  or program  of their right  to reasonable  accommodation and inform  them to  contact  the training office or force development flight if they require reasonable accommodation, and what accommodation may be needed (T-3). 8.3.9.3.  Training Manager/Point of Contact will: 8.3.9.3.1.  Acknowledge receipt of accommodation requests (T-1). 8.3.9.3.2.  Review employees’ requests for reasonable accommodation (T-1). 8.3.9.3.3.  Request assistance from the local DPM, SAF/GCA or AF/A1Q when there is a question regarding whether or not sufficient documentation and justification has been provided by employee (T-1). 8.3.9.3.4.  In the  event  that  the medical  documentation  is  insufficient,  the DPM  will contact  the  employee  to  request  additional  information  to  clarify  the  need  for accommodation  and  possible  alternative  effective  accommodations  (see  para.  8.6. below) (T-1). 8.3.9.3.4.1.  The training manager will request additional documentation from the employee, only after consulting with AF/A1Q or SAF/GCA (T-1). 8.3.9.3.5.  The training manager will engage the employee in an interactive process to determine possible alternative effective accommodation(s) (T-3). 8.3.9.4.  The  Air  Force  has  an  obligation  to  ensure  that  reasonable  accommodations  are provided, regardless if the training occurs on Air Force property or elsewhere.  It is the joint responsibility of the office sponsoring the employee and the organization sponsoring the training to provide required reasonable accommodations (T-0). 8.3.10.  DPM will: 8.3.10.1.  Develop  a the  reasonable  accommodation procedures and the importance of referring individuals with disabilities who are seeking reasonable accommodation to the proper official(s) in a timely manner (T-1). thorough  understanding  of 8.3.10.2.  Assist  in  the  reasonable  accommodation  interactive  process  by  ensuring  the commander,  manager,  CPS,  NAF-HRS,  EO,  supervisors,  employees,  and  other appropriate staff are apprised of issues involving reasonable accommodation requests or needs,  and  coordinating  the  various  responses  and  activities  required  to  fulfill  the  Air Force’s responsibility under the Rehabilitation Act and applicable EEOC regulations and enforcement guidelines (T-1). AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 51 8.3.10.3.  Encourage the use of job accommodation resources available to both managers and  employees,  i.e.,  the  DoD’s  Computer/Electronic  Accommodation  Program  (CAP) and the Department of Labor’s Job Accommodation Network (JAN) (T-3). 8.3.10.4.  Perform all other duties as outlined in 3.15 of this Instruction. 8.3.10.5.  Participate in interactive discussions between the employee and the supervisor, at  the  request  of  either  the  employee  or  the  supervisor  (T-1).    The  DPM  is  available  to help facilitate the interactive process by: 8.3.10.5.1.  Explaining the reasonable accommodation requirements and options; 8.3.10.5.2.  Assisting  the  supervisor/manager  in  reviewing  requests  for  reasonable accommodation; 8.3.10.5.3.  Advising the supervisor/manager and employee if additional information is needed and whether the request falls under reasonable accommodation regulations (i.e., if the employee has a qualifying disability under the Rehabilitation Act/ADA); 8.3.10.5.4.  Consulting  with  medical  personnel  on  the  specific  disability  requiring accommodation and potential reasonable accommodation solutions; 8.3.10.5.5.

Assisting  the  employee  and  the  supervisor/manager  in  determining what other employee programs, if any, should be invoked or recommended during this process, e.g., OWCP, Employee Assistance Program (EAP). 8.4.  Reasonable Accommodation Process: 8.4.1.  Step  1:  Initiating  a  Request.    An  employee  who  wishes  to  initiate  the  interactive process  to  obtain  reasonable  accommodation  may  make  an  oral  or  written  request  to  the immediate  supervisor/manager.    The  request  may  also  come  from  an  individual  seeking  an accommodation  on  behalf  of  the  employee,  such  as  family  member,  friend,  DPM,  union representative  or  health  care  professional.    There  is  no  requirement  that  the  request  be  in writing  and  the  request  does  not  have  to  contain  any  special  words,  such  as  “reasonable accommodation.” 8.4.1.1.  As a general rule, the individual with a disability has the most knowledge about the need for  reasonable  accommodation and therefore should inform  the  supervisor that an  accommodation  is  needed.    However,  the  supervisor  must  initiate  the  reasonable accommodation interactive process (see 8.4.2.), without being asked, if the supervisor: (a) 52 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 knows  that  the  employee  has  a  disability,  (b)  knows,  or  has  reason  to  know,  that  the employee is  experiencing  workplace problems  because of the disability,  and (c) knows, or  has  reason  to  know,  that  the  disability  prevents  the  employee  from  requesting  a reasonable accommodation (T-0).  If the individual with a disability states that he or she does  not  need  a  reasonable  accommodation,  the  supervisor  will  have  fulfilled  her/his obligation (T-1). requests, employees seeking reasonable accommodation 8.4.2.  Step  2:  Interactive  Process.    To  enable  the  Air  Force  to  maintain  accurate  records regarding reasonable accommodation  should  follow  up  an  oral  request  by  confirming  their  request  in  writing (including  email  or  facsimile)  to  the  manager  or  supervisor.    Attachment  11  is  a  sample Reasonable  Accommodation  Request  Form  employees  may  use.    While  the  written confirmation  should  be  made  as  soon  as  possible  following  the  request,  it  is  not  a requirement for the request itself.  The manager/supervisor will begin processing the request as  soon  as  it  is  made,  whether  or  not  the  confirmation  has  been  provided  in  writing  (T-1).  Written  confirmation  is  not  required  when  an  individual  needs  an  accommodation  on  a repeated basis (e.g., the assistance of sign language interpreters).  In these cases, the written form may only be necessary for the first request although, of course, appropriate notice must be given each time the accommodation is needed. 8.4.2.1.  When the supervisor receives the reasonable accommodation request, he or she shall  acknowledge  receipt  of  the  request  and  enter  into  an  interactive  dialogue  process within  10  business  days  of  the  request  (T-1).    The  reasonable  accommodation  process begins as soon as the oral or written request is made to any supervisor in the employee’s chain of command.  Therefore, communication is a priority throughout the entire process.  The supervisor/manager will take a proactive approach in searching out and considering possible  accommodations,  including  consulting  the  DPM,  medical  personnel  and  other appropriate resources for assistance, and will explain the process to the employee (T-3). 8.4.2.2.  The  supervisor/manager  will  consult  with  the  individual  with  a  disability  to ascertain  the  precise  job-related  limitations  imposed  by  the  individual’s  disability  and how those limitations could  be overcome with  a  reasonable accommodation  (T-3).     At this point, the supervisor can request the following information: 8.4.2.2.1.  Description of the disability necessitating the accommodation; 8.4.2.2.2.  Description of the accommodation, if known, that will permit the employee to perform the essential functions of his or her job/position, and/or which will enable the  employee  to  enjoy  the  same  benefits  and  privileges  in  the  workplace  as  non-disabled employees; and 8.4.2.2.3.  Sufficient  medical  documentation  that  supports  or  confirms  the  disability and  the  need  for  the  requested  accommodation,  when  the  disability  or  need  for  the requested  accommodation  is  not  obvious.    Sufficient  documentation,  as  defined  by EEOC’s  Enforcement  Guidance (e.g.,  “Enforcement  Guidance:  Reasonable Accommodation  and  Undue  Hardship  under  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act (ADA)”, is documentation describing the disability; its nature, severity, and duration; and  the  extent  to  which  it  limits  the  employee’s  ability  to  perform  the  activity  or activities.  The supervisor may also request from the employee a medical release and medical documentation to support the requested accommodation.  (See Section 8.7.) AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 53 8.4.3.  Step 3: Determining Reasonable Accommodation. 8.4.3.1.  In consultation with the individual to be accommodated, the supervisor/manager will identify potential accommodations and  assess the effectiveness  each  would have in enabling  the  individual  to  perform  the  essential  functions  of  the  position  (T-3).    In circumstances  where  the  employee  and  the  supervisor  do  not  agree  on  the  most appropriate  accommodation,  the  supervisor  will  immediately  consult  with  the  DPM  to help determine the appropriate effective reasonable accommodation (T-3). 8.4.3.1.1.  The  supervisor  should  consider  the  preference  of  the  individual  to  be accommodated and select and implement the accommodation that is most appropriate for  both  the  employee  and  the  Air  Force.    The  Air  Force  need  not  provide  the employee’s  preferred  accommodations,  but  may  choose  among reasonable accommodations as long as the chosen accommodation is effective. 8.4.3.2.  The employee must cooperate with the supervisor/manager and/or the DPM by: (a)  providing  the  specifics  of  the  accommodation  requested  and  how  the  requested accommodation  will  allow  the  individual  to  perform  the  essential  functions  of  the  job; and  (b)  providing  the  requested  medical  documentation  and  medical  release(s)  (T-3).  Failure  to  provide  the  information  necessary  to  evaluate  the  validity  of  the  requested accommodation may result in the denial of the request if not submitted within 20 business days of the request for medical documentation, unless extenuating circumstances exist. 8.4.3.3.  The supervisor/manager will identify the essential functions of the job/position, and determine if removing any functions would fundamentally alter the job/position  (T-3).  Performance  standards  should  not  be  lowered  as  an  accommodation.    Removing  a function  from  the  position  that  is  deemed  critical  to  the  job/position  (an  “essential function”) is not a reasonable accommodation. 8.4.3.4.  If  it  is  determined  that  an  employee  is  a  qualified    individual  with  a  disability, after  participating  in  the  interactive  process  and  fully  examining  and  researching  the reasonable  accommodation  request,  the  supervisor/manager  will  provide  a  written decision on the request  for accommodation in  the shortest  time practicable, but  no later than  30  business  days  from  the  date  of  the  original  request  when  the  employee’s supervisor  is  the  deciding  official  and  there  are  no  extenuating  circumstances.    In  the event  medical  documentation the accommodation  request  will  stop  on  the  day  the  request  is  made  to  the  individual  to obtain  medical  documentation, the information/documentation  is  received  by  the  requester  (see  Section  8.5.,  Timeline  for Processing Reasonable Accommodation Requests) (T-1). timeframe  for  processing resume  on is  requested, the and  will the  day that 8.4.3.5.  The Air Force has the final decision on which accommodation is implemented, based on factors such as cost, effectiveness and business feasibility, but will consider the preference  of  the  individual  to  be  accommodated  and  select  and  implement  the accommodation that is most appropriate for both the employee and the Air Force. 8.4.3.6.  If  it  becomes  apparent  through  medical  documentation  that  an  accommodation cannot  be  made  in  the  current  job/position  for  a  disabled  employee,  reassignment  as  a form  of  reasonable  accommodation  will  be  considered  as  a  last  resort  option.    In  such cases, the employee will have an obligation to provide an updated resume for use in the 54 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 reassignment  consideration  process  (see  Section  8.6.,  Reassignment  as  a  Form  of Reasonable Accommodation) 8.4.3.7.  If it is determined, based on medical documentation, that the disabled employee can no longer perform the essential functions of their position, and either a reassignment is not available or the employee is unable to perform the essential duties of positions to which  reassignment  might  be  made,  the  employee  will  be  given  assistance  by  their servicing CPS in applying to OPM for disability retirement, if he or she so chooses (T-2). 8.4.3.8.  If  an  alternate  accommodation  is  approved,  the  written  notification  should explain both the reasons for the denial of the original accommodation and the reasons it is believed the chosen alternative will be effective. 8.5.  Timelines for Processing Reasonable Accommodation Requests. 8.5.1.  Processing  of  all  requests  should  begin  immediately  regardless  of  whether  written confirmation has been provided.  Requirements for repeated accommodations, such as a sign language interpreter, do  not  require a written confirmation  after the initial  approval.   These provisions  are  designed  to  insure  the  timely  processing  of  reasonable  accommodation requests in accordance with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 8.5.2.  Identify  alternates  for  all  individuals  involved  in  receiving,  processing  or  approving accommodation  requests.    Requests  cannot  be  delayed  due  to  the  leave,  temporary  duty assignment, or other absence or obligation of anyone involved in the process chain. 8.5.3.  Forward requests beyond the supervisor’s approval authority to the decision-makers at the appropriate level within five business days unless extenuating circumstances exist (as that term  is  defined below).   Upon receipt, the deciding official  will notify the requestor he/she has received the request and arrange to meet with the individual to discuss the request and the process. 8.5.4.  Decisions  and  implementation  of  requests  for  reasonable  accommodation  should  be processed and implemented in the shortest time practicable, whenever possible.  They will be made  in  no  later  than  30  business  days  from  the  date  of  the  original  request  when  the employee’s  supervisor  is  the  deciding  official  and  there  are  no  extenuating  circumstances.  Some  requests  require  processing  in  a  time  frame  much  shorter  than  the  30  days.    These include accommodation requests that enable applicants to apply or compete for jobs, or that will enable an employee to attend and participate in a meeting when only short notice of the meeting was given to the employee. 8.5.5.  Extenuating circumstances are factors that could not reasonably have been anticipated or  avoided  in  advance  of  the  request  for  accommodation.    Extenuating  circumstances  may include  an  outstanding  request  for  medical  information;  the  purchase  of  equipment; employee working with equipment on a trial basis to ensure that it is effective before being purchased;  or  facility  modifications  or  improvements.    If  the  Air  Force  determines  medical documentation is needed, the decision and implementation will be made within 30 business days from the date the decision maker receives the relevant medical information, absent any extenuating circumstances. 8.5.6.  If the time frames cannot be met because of extenuating circumstances that delay the consideration  and  implementation  of  a  reasonable  accommodation,  the  requestor  must  be AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 55 notified of the reasons for the delay and an approximate date on which a decision is expected.  Supervisors  and  managers  will  consider  temporary  measures  to  assist  the  person  with  a disability  as  an  interim  step  until  a  decision  on  or  implementation  of  the  requested accommodation can be made (T-1). 8.5.7.  Not  all  accommodations  produce  the  desired  outcome.    The  supervisor,  manager,  or appropriate individual must monitor the effectiveness of the reasonable accommodation once it has been provided for a period of time to ensure that accommodation is effective (T-2).  If the accommodation proves ineffective, the interactive process starts again. 8.6.  Reassignment/Change to a Lower Grade as a Form of Reasonable Accommodation. 8.6.1.  CPS is responsible for overseeing the reassignment process and change to lower grade process.    Reassignment  /change  to  a  lower  grade  is  available  only  to  employees  with disabilities, not to applicants. 8.6.2.  Reassignment/change to a lower grade is only considered if no appropriate reasonable accommodation  is  available  to  enable  the  disabled  individual  to  perform  his  or  her  current job/position  or  if  the  only  effective  accommodation  would  cause  undue  hardship.    If reassignment  is  being  considered,  the  employee’s  immediate  supervisor  will  explain  why they could  not  be accommodated in  the current  position.  The immediate supervisor should determine the employee’s preferences with respect to the reassignment. 8.6.2.1.  Positions appropriate for consideration for reassignment/change to a lower grade of  disabled  individuals  will  include:    (a)  all  vacant  positions  at  the  same  grade,  or  at  a lower grade, within the Air Force in the commuting area or any geographic area to which the  employee  indicates  he  or  she  is  willing  to  move  and  for  which  the  employee  is qualified;  and (b)  any planned jobs/positions which appropriate officials can reasonably assume will become available over a period of 60 business days, for which the disabled employee is qualified, at same pay, or lower rate of pay. 8.6.2.1.1.  The 60 business days will begin at the point in time that management has sufficient the  employee  cannot  be accommodated  in  his/her  current  position,  and  the  employee  is  notified  within  the first five business days (T-1). to  officially  determine information that 8.6.2.1.2.  Positions/jobs  determined  to  be  appropriate  for  reassignment/change  to  a lower grade  as a reasonable accommodation for which a vacancy announcement has been  published  are  not  filled  until  a  written  reassignment/change  to  a  lower  grade offer has been provided  to  the qualified disabled employee  as long  as  a selection to fill  the  position  has  not  been  made  and  there  are  no  pending  priority  placement matches. 8.6.2.1.3.  The  employee  is  provided  three  business  days  to  either  accept  or  decline the  offer.    If  the  employee  declines,  the  agency  will  proceed  with  separation  action due  to  employee’s  declination  (and  absence  of  any  other  effective  accommodation besides reassignment/change to a lower grade) (T-1).  The agency will proceed with the selection process in accordance with standard selection procedures (T-1). 8.6.2.2.  Subject to the provisions of any applicable collective bargaining agreement, the Air Force will not pay for the relocation to the new duty station outside the employee’s 56 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 current  commuting  area,  unless  a  paid  move  would  normally  be  offered  because  of recruiting or other circumstances, or if OWCP regulations require the payment of moving expenses. 8.6.2.3.  The  Air  Force  will  have  an  obligation  to  reassign  a  disabled  employee  to  a vacant position that is equivalent in terms of grade, status, or other relevant factors (e.g., benefits, geographical location) for which the employee qualifies. reviewing 8.6.2.3.1.  Reassignment/CLG  may  be  made  only  to  a  vacant  position.    If  the employee is interested in a reassignment, the CPS will begin the search for a position locally.    If  no  positions  are  found  locally,  the  employee  may  request  to  expand  the search  in  this  order:    a)  MAJCOM  wide  search  and  b)  AF  wide  search.    The CPS/MAJCOM  will  conduct  MAJCOM  and  Air  Force-wide  searches  for  vacancies by at https://mypers.af.mil/app/answers/detail/a_id/23172.    The  CPS/MAJCOM  will review  MAJCOM  wide  vacancies  by  selecting  the  Open  Fill  RPA  Status  Report  by MAJCOM and/or  review Air Force wide vacancies by selecting the Open Fill RPA Status Report.  COCOM Daily Fill RPA Status Reports are also available for review.  If the CPS/MAJCOM identifies a position for potential placement after conducting an Air  Force    search  AFPC/AFPC/DP3FM,  Civilian  Force  Management  Branch,  will facilitate and serve as the liaison for both gaining and losing CPS (T-1). for  Personnel  Action (RPA)  Tracker the  Request 8.6.2.3.2.  Search for a reassignment/CLG will last no longer than 60 business days, unless  there  are  extenuating  circumstances.    As  noted  in  8.6.2.1.1.,  the  60  business days  will  begin  at  the  point  in  time  that  management  has  sufficient  information  to officially  determine  that  the  employee  cannot  be  accommodated  in  his/her  current position. 8.6.3.  If the employee would prefer a lower paying position/job in the same commuting area over a change in geographic location, a written request will be submitted to the CPS, NAF-HRS,  or  DPM  at  the  time  the  updated  resume  is  submitted.    The  employee  must  meet  the OPM  Operating Manual for Qualifications Standards for General  Schedule Positions,  OPM Job  Qualification  System  for  Trades  and  Labor  Occupations  (Handbook  X-118C),  or  other applicable qualification requirements, for any position/job to which reassignment or change to a lower grade is considered (T-0). 8.6.4.  The  CPS  must  offer  an  employee  with  a  disability  requesting  reassignment  must  be offered a reassignment/change to a lower grade as a reasonable accommodation to a position for which a vacancy announcement has been published and the employee is qualified for, as long  as  a  selection  to  fill  the  position  has  not  been  made  and  there  are  no  pending  priority placement  matches  (T-1).    Refer  to  the  PPP  Handbook,  Ch  4,  section  C,  Exceptions  not requiring prior approval, 2i(12) for additional guidance. the  gaining identified  position  for 8.6.5.  The  CPS  at reassignment/change  to  a  lower  grade  is  located  must  involve  the  gaining  organization  to ensure that the individual is properly considered and, if qualified, placed in that new position (T-1). installation  at  which the 8.6.5.1.  The determination as to whether the individual is qualified for the position is to be determined by AFPC in coordination with the gaining organization. AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 57 8.6.6.  If  more  than  one  opportunity  for  reassignment/change  to  a  lower  grade  position  is available, the employee may indicate preference although management has final discretion to fill  positions  in  accordance  with  the  business  needs  of  the  organization.    The  CPS  must document if same grade positions are eliminated from consideration due to undue hardship to the  organization  and  an  offer  of  a  lower  graded  position  is  made,  an  explanation  of  the decision  and  the  circumstances  involving  undue  hardship  in  the  decision  letter  to  the employee (T-1). 8.6.7.  Reasonable  accommodation  does  not  include  placement  of  an  employee  to  a  higher graded position.  Promotions and Re-Promotions are not authorized as a form of reasonable accommodation.    Reassignment  action  does  not  include  promotion  to  a  vacant  position  or automatic promotion, if the employee is reassigned to a position that previously held higher grade level potential. In other words, 8.6.8.  The Air Force will have no obligation to create a new position/job in order to provide reassignment/change to a lower grade as an accommodation (T-0). 8.6.9.  The Air Force will not displace any current employee from his or her position/job in order to provide another employee with a reassignment/change to a lower grade opportunity as a reasonable accommodation. the disability retirement 8.6.10.  Under by  OPM, reassignment/change  to  a  lower  grade  will  be  considered  whenever  an  employee  seeks disability  retirement.    Efforts  will  be  made  to  reassign  the  employee  to  a  vacant  position within the Air Force at the same grade within the commuting area. promulgated procedures 8.6.11.  In  the  event  an  employee  with  a  disability  declines  a  suitable  job  offer  after  all documented good faith efforts to provide a reasonable accommodation have been exhausted, the agency  may take appropriate personnel  actions up to  and including removal due to the employee’s inability to perform the essential functions of his/her job.(T-0). 8.7.  Medical Documentation. 8.7.1.  When the disability or the need for reasonable accommodation is not obvious, the Air Force  may  request  medical  documentation  to  determine  whether  an  individual  requesting accommodation  has  a  disability,  to  identify  functional  limitations  and  to  determine appropriate accommodations. 8.7.2.  Only documentation needed to establish that a person has a disability as stipulated in the Rehabilitation Act, and that the disability necessitates a reasonable accommodation will be requested.  The Air force will request the employee with a disability to provide relevant supplemental  medical  information  if  the  initial  information  submitted  does  not  clearly explain  the  nature  of  the  disability  or  how  the  requested  accommodation  will  assist  the requestor  to  perform  the  essential  functions  of  the  position  or  enjoy  the  benefits  and privileges of the workplace (T-0). 8.7.3.  In  most  cases,  complete  medical  records  cannot  be  requested  because  such  records may  reveal  information  that  is  not  relevant  to  determining  whether  the  employee  has  a disability,  or  needs  an  accommodation.    Requests  for  medical  information  should  be narrowly  tailored  to  answer  specific  questions  to  help  determine  if  the  individual  has  a 58 AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 disability  and/or  if  reasonable  accommodation  is  needed  (and  if  so,  what  specifically  is required as a reasonable accommodation). 8.8.  Medical Confidentiality. 8.8.1.  Supervisors  will  ensure  any  medical  information  obtained  from  an  employee  is collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate medical files and be treated as a confidential  medical  record,  except  when  disclosure  is  required  to  inform  supervisors  of necessary restrictions or accommodations or for emergency medical treatment (T-0). 8.8.2.  Supervisors  will  ensure  only  information  that  is  necessary  to  evaluate  the  eligibility for reasonable accommodation and the effectiveness of proposed accommodations is shared with those responsible for making a determination on the reasonable accommodation request and/or accomplishing the accommodation (T-0). 8.8.2.1.  Supervisors  will  ensure  specifics  about  the  employee’s  medical  condition, whether  related  or  not  related  to  the  disability,  including  diagnosis  and  prognosis,  are kept  strictly  confidential.    Supervisors  will  ensure  all  medical  records  are  kept  separate from  employee  personnel  files  and  be  maintained  exclusively  in  the  Official  Employee Medical Folder (T-0). 8.8.3.  Before making an offer of employment, an employer may not ask job applicants about the existence, nature, or severity of a disability.  Applicants may be asked about their ability to  perform  job  functions.    A  job  offer  may  be  conditioned  on  the  results  of  a  medical examination, but  only if the examination is  a requirement for all  entering  employees in the same  job  category.    Supervisors  must  ensure  requests  for  medical  information  and  medical examinations of employees must be job-related and consistent with business necessity (T-0). 8.9.  Denial of Reasonable Accommodations. 8.9.1.  Denials of reasonable accommodation must be in writing and issued no later than 10 business  days  of  the  decision  to  deny  the  request  for  reasonable  accommodation.    Denials must  include  specific  reasons  for  the  denial  and  the  employee  or  office  that  made  the decision. The employee’s manager must notify the individual that he or she has a right to file an EEO complaint, the procedures for doing so, as well as identify and explain any avenues available for informal dispute resolution (T-1).  For disability-related complaint procedures, see AFI 36-2706, Equal Opportunity Program, Military and Civilian. 8.9.2.  If  an  alternate  accommodation  is  approved,  this  is  a  modification  not  a  denial  of reasonable  accommodation.    Written  notification  should  explain  both  the  reasons  for  the rejection of the original accommodation and the reasons it is believed the chosen alternative is effective.   AFI36-205  1 DECEMBER 2016 59 8.9.3.  If  it  is  determined  that  the  employee  is  not  an  individual  with  a  disability,  no reasonable accommodation is possible, the requested accommodation is not reasonable due to lack  of  appropriate  supporting  medical  evidence  or  other  necessary  information,  there  is  a lack of available vacant jobs/positions for which a disabled employee is qualified, or there is a clear case of undue hardship, a decision letter documenting the denial is issued.
