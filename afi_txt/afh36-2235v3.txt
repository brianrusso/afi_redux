handbook serves as a guide for applying the InstructionalSystem Development (ISD) process in defense systemsacquisition.  It follows the principles of AFPD 36-22, AFMAN36-2234, and other policy documents.  It is intended as an easyreading guide for the novice to ISD, as well as the veteran.While it is designed as a "stand-alone" document, you must alsobe familiar with the referenced policy documents.In the past, application of ISD to defense system acquisition hasnot necessarily been an orderly or well-thought-out process.Sometimes training was considered at concept exploration whilein extreme cases it may not have occurred until after the systemwas fielded.  As a result of these variances, the quality and depthof training coverage varied widely from program to program.The purpose of this handbook is to incorporate the applicableregulations and manuals into a handbook that covers the majorphases of the ISD process and addresses them to the variousphases of defense system acquisition.  The ISD process hasapplication in all acquisition phases, but the major effort occursbetween the demonstration and validation phase, and theproduction and deployment phase (Figure 1).  The acquisitioncycle can last ten years or more, requiring frequent coordinationand evaluation, revisiting prior effort and redirecting as required.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Purpose(Continued)Figure 1 System Acquisition Life CycleDeterminationofMission NeedAcquisition Life CycleMilestones and PhasesPhase 0ConceptExploration andDefinitionPhase IDemonstration andValidationPhase IIPhase IIIPhase IVEngineering andManufacturingDevelopmentProductionandDeploymentOperationsandSupportMilestone 0Milestone 1Milestone IIMilestone IIIMilestone IVConceptStudiesApprovalConceptDemonstrationApprovalDevelopmentApprovalProductionApprovalMajorModificationApprovalAs RequiredIs this handbookfor you?This handbook addresses the question, "How do you apply ISDin defense system acquisition?"

It ensures that personnelare taught in a cost-efficient way the knowledge, skills, andattitudes essential for successful job performance.  ISD helps tovalidate that:There is a training need.There is an effective and efficient solution to the need.The solution can be implemented.The solution can be assessed to determine whether it meetsthe need.During the development and operation of an instructionalsystem, there is a total continuing requirement for technicaland management improvement.Basis for ISDISD is based on:Basic research on how people learnBasic research on how people communicateThe systems engineering processThe development of media and computer technologiesAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 20029Why use ISD?Instruction must be planned if it is to be effective.  ISDrequires that:Job tasks and mission requirements are analyzed.The target population to perform the job is analyzed.The difference between what the target population can donow vs. what they must be able to do to perform the job isidentified as training requirements.Training requirements are addressed by a hierarchy oftraining objectives.Training objectives are achieved through media and methods.Media and methods are selected to optimize efficiency andeffectiveness of training.Training courses are developed and validated to ensure thattraining objectives are met.There is a continuous feedback loop throughout for qualityimprovement.Goals of ISDThe goals of ISD are to produce students who can perform theirjobs after receiving instruction, and to reduce overall costs oftraining by accurately identifying training requirements andequipment.How to use ISDISD is:Flexible and systematicA tool to develop the right training to solve the problemISD is NOT a step-by-step linear process.Don’t have a "checklist mentality"when you’re using ISD.You need to think of ISD as being circular.  You can startanywhere at any time, as the need requires.  During each phaseof the ISD process, you continually assess the quality of theprocess and any product input.  Evaluation is ongoing throughoutthe life cycle of the training system.

Although each part of this modelis explained in AFMAN 36-2234, further discussion tailored toacquisition is included in this handbook.Figure 2 Updated ISD ModelWhat is a totaltraining system?A total training system is a systematically developed curriculumincluding, but not necessarily limited to, courseware, classroomaids, training simulators and devices, operational equipment,embedded training capability and personnel to operate, maintainor employ a system.  The training system includes all necessaryelements of logistic support.  This is covered in more detail inChapter 2.QualityimprovementQuality improvement, with an emphasis on evaluation throughoutthe life cycle of the program, is the glue that holds the totalsystem together. Figure 2 shows the updated ISD model withquality improvement and system functions.What are systemfunctions?Successful training systems must have basic top-level functions,and these functions must be in place before a training systemcan operate.  The basic training system functions are discussedin the following paragraphs and are depicted in Figure 3.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200211What are systemfunctions?(Continued)Management.  This is the function of directing or controllingall aspects of the training system.  These activities are anintegral part of conducting training.Support.  This provides for and maintains the system on aday-to-day and long-term basis.  This includes long-rangeplanning as well as day-to-day activities.  Examples areresources you need to keep equipment functioning, such asan equipment maintenance contract.Administration.  This is the part of management thatperforms the day-to-day tasks of operating an instructionalsystem. This includes functions such as documentation,student assignments, and student records.Delivery.  This is the means of giving students the training.Instructors, computers, and textbooks are examples of waysto deliver instruction.Evaluation.  This function is the continuous process ofgathering feedback data through formative, summative andoperational evaluations to assess the system and, mostimportant, student performance.Figure 3 System FunctionsAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002When do youimplement them?The system functions must be working before you start thetraining.  Aspects of the training system functions are activethroughout all phases of ISD.Relation to ISDUsing these essential functions to design the overall trainingsystem architecture and then allocating them to the respectivesystem components, or people responsible, ensures that thesefunctions are operational when the total training system isfielded.  ISD products are integrated into the total trainingsystem, and aspects of the system functions are activethroughout all phases of the ISD process.System functionsand ISD phasesFigure 4 shows the phases most often used in the systemsapproach, which are analysis, design, development, andimplementation, with the evaluation activities integrated into eachphase of the process.  The phases are embedded within thesystem functions.  Evaluation is shown as the central feedback"network" for the total system.Figure 4 Functions with PhasesContinued on next pageAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200213System functionsand ISD phases(Continued)The instructional development process, which the modelsummarizes, calls for instructional developers to:Analyze and determine what instruction is needed.Design instruction to meet the need.Develop instructional materials to support systemrequirements.Implement the instructional system.Evaluation is a central function that takes place at every phase.Symbolically, Figure 4 shows that all phases of the modeldepend on each of the other phases.  The ISD process allowsthe instructional developer or design team to enter or reenter thevarious phases of the process as determined by the nature andscope of the development or revision activity.  The phases of theupdated model are described in more detail in separate chaptersof this handbook.EvaluationEvaluation is a continuous process beginning during the analysisphase and continuing throughout the life cycle of the instructionalsystem.  Evaluation consists of:Formative Evaluation, consisting of process and productevaluations conducted during the analysis and designphases, and validation, which is conducted during thedevelopment phase.  Included are individual and small-grouptryouts.Summative Evaluation, consisting of operational tryoutsconducted once the entire training system is fielded.Operational Evaluation, consisting of periodic internal andexternal evaluation of the operational system during theimplementation phase.Each form of evaluation should be used during development,update, and revision of instruction, if possible, and if the form ofevaluation is applicable.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Updated AF ISDmodelFigure 5 depicts the updated Air Force ISD model.  Thiscompleted figure shows the system functions and ISD phasesembedded within the quality improvement (QI) process.Figure 5 Updated AF ISD ModelThe updated model graphically illustrates that:Evaluation is the foundation of the ISD process.ISD is a continuous process with the flexibility to enter andreenter the various phases, as necessary, to develop, update,or revise instruction.All ISD activities take place within and are dependent on thesystem functions.Teamwork is required between personnel performing systemfunctions and those designing, developing, and implementinginstructional systems.All ISD activities and system functions focus on continuousquality improvements in the system.QualityimprovementAlthough Quality Improvement (QI) is covered in detail on page36, you should remember that QI is the continuous, organizedcreation of beneficial change to the system.  The objective of QIis to foster continuous improvements in the process and productsof ISD.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200215IntroductionChapter 2TOTAL TRAINING SYSTEMOverviewFielding a new defense system with a total training system is aproject that requires considerable management, coordination andintegration.  Lessons learned in fielding total training systemshave shown that organizations responsible for integration of thetraining system have been left scrambling.  Why?  Becauseimportant and sometimes even critical functions were overlookedearly in the overall design.  The shortfalls range from "commonsense" such as failing to analyze student productionrequirements, to "technical" such as improper integration of out-the-cockpit visual system design with the design of the simulator.Analysis of successful programs concluded that there are basictop-level functions required for operation of a total trainingsystem.PurposeThe purpose of this chapter is to explain the total training systemconcept in the context of instructional system design.  Theseconcepts apply whether you are buying a total system or parts ofa system, a new defense system or a modification.Where to readabout itThe overview of total training system acquisition is explained inthe following sections.SectionTitleABCDEFGHAcquisition Concept DefinitionAnalysisDesignDevelopmentImplementationEvaluationQuality ImprovementSystem Engineering InteractionPage1727293133343644AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002What is a totaltraining system?As mentioned earlier, a total training system is a systematicallydeveloped curriculum.  The training system includes allnecessary elements of logistic support.  In order to acquire atotal training system, follow the instructional system developmentprocess interacting with the systems engineering process.There is no perfectmodelNo model is the "perfect" model.  Variations of each model maybe used to best meet the objectives for the training beingdeveloped.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200217IntroductionPurposeSection AAcquisition Concept DefinitionAcquisition is the obtaining of supplies or services, by and for theuse of the federal government, using appropriated funds.  Beforeacquiring these supplies and services, you must evaluate theconstraints and opportunities to make a sound decision.  Oncethe decision to acquire something (rather than obtaining itthrough internal development) is made, an overall approach tothe acquisition should be developed.The acquisition concept serves as a starting point from whichother activities originate.  The activities generated by a decisionto lease supplies or services can be very different from thosegenerated by a decision to purchase them.  Other factors thatcan change acquisition activities are sole sourcing, competitivecontracting, research and development, dual sourcing, and othercontracting methods.Where to readabout itPrior to making a decision whether or not to obtain defensesystem training through acquisition, the process leading to thedecision has begun. Important aspects of this process aredescribed under the topics listed below.TopicTraining System Requirements Studies InitiationTraining Planning TeamTraining System ConceptSystem Training PlanTraining Acquisition Strategy AnalysisPage18 19222426AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Training System Requirements Studies InitiationIntroductionTo ensure proper planning and development, Training SystemRequirements (TSR) must be considered early in the cycle ofdefense system acquisition.  For this reason, preliminary trainingconsideration should begin in the pre-concept phase of systemacquisition.  At this time, the defense system using command willform and chair the Training Planning Team (TPT).  Once thedefense system is defined in the demonstration and validationphase of acquisition, TSR studies are initiated.  A TrainingSystem Requirements Analysis (TSRA) is a systematic approachto front-end analysis of a training system based upon anintegrated instructional systems development/systemsengineering process that develops data items to document thetraining and preliminary system requirements.PurposeThe purposes of the TSR studies are to:Determine training need.Outline the "big picture."Define training requirements.Define thoroughness of data and analysis.Involve defense system contractor in training issues early on.What are trainingrequirements?Training requirements are determined by comparing the skillsand knowledge requirements needed to do a job, to the currentabilities of the persons expected to do the job.  The differencebetween those current attitudes, abilities, knowledge, and theskills necessary to perform specific tasks in order to operate,maintain, and support a defense system are the trainingrequirements.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200219FurtherexplanationThere are several areas to consider when deciding on the TSRstudy approach.  For example, is a TSR study really needed?  Ifso, to what depth?  Should the TSR study be done by anindependent contractor or the training system developmentcontractor (phased approach)?  Have alternative acquisitionstrategies been identified to allow for consideration of innovativesolutions to the training need?  The TSR study lays thefoundation for the ISD process.  (Further information is availableas each document is explained in this handbook.)AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002IntroductionWhat it isObjectivesWho isresponsible?Training Planning TeamCoordination and communication are the keys to success in anyprogram, and are most critical in the training business.  Theformation of a Training Planning Team (TPT) helps keep themany players working together to reach the training systemobjectives.A Training Planning Team (TPT) is defined as an action groupcomposed of representatives from all pertinent functional areas,disciplines, and interests involved in the life cycle of a specificdefense training system.  The TPT is formed at pre-concept andcontinues throughout the acquisition and day-to-day operation ofthe training system.  The personnel on the TPT represent theusing command, the system program office, and other concernedagencies.  The TPT develops and uses the System Training Plan(STP) to ensure that training considerations, constraints andopportunities are adequately addressed in the defense systemacquisition modification process.The primary objective of the training planning team is to get theright agencies communicating and coordinating from the verybeginning as a team.  Once a System Program Office (SPO) isformed, the TPT bridges between the SPO and the operatingcommand.  The goal is to develop the STP and keep it currentthroughout the life of the defense system.The primary operating command will establish and chair TPTsthroughout the life cycle of the defense system.  The programoffice (normally AFMC) will support and assist the chair asrequired.  The using command will also be responsible fordeveloping a Manpower Estimate Report (MER) followingacquisition guidelines.Note: The training wheels were put into motion prior to theformation of the SPO.  Training was specified in the ProgramManagement Directive (PMD), which is the primary documentthat directs the program office to begin a system acquisition.Using the PMD, the program office develops a ProgramContinued on next pageAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200221Who isresponsible?(Continued)Management Plan (PMP) which outlines responsibilities andgeneral management objectives.  As part of PMP development,all applicable MAJCOMs provide inputs.  While the SPO andprimary operating command are considered the prime players,Air Education and Training Command (AETC) has a key role.This is true even if the training system will be contractorprocured, developed and operated.Requirements andresponsibilitiesAir Force Pamphlet 50-11 details specific requirements andresponsibilities for the training planning team.OtherresponsibilitiesAcquiring training is a complex process involving many agenciesand personnel.  As stated earlier, while the operating commandand the program office are the two major players, many other keyoffices are involved.  For example, AETC plays a key role thatvaries depending on the nature of the training involved.  AETCnormally will:Be a member of and support the TPT.Designate an AETC Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)for the specific program.Assist in determining whether all or parts of training will beAETC- or contractor-developed.  (If AETC or USAFdeveloped maintenance training, read "Air Force-DevelopedMaintenance Training" [page 145].)Designate AETC responsible agencies and define roles.Designate AETC supporting agencies and define roles.Note: As mentioned earlier, the TPT continues throughout thelife of the defense system.  While the TPT may not meet everyday, every week, or even every quarter, they will meet frequentlyenough to evaluate changes in the defense system for their effecton the training system.  The TPT will update the STP annually orwhen changes occur that affect training in:TacticsPersonnelStructureDemographicsManning levelsContinued on next pageAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Otherresponsibilities(Continued)Defense systemHardwareSoftwareSubsystemTraining assets availabilityFunding priorities/levelsBasingOperating commandsThe TPT develops and implements alternate training strategiesuntil the training system becomes current again with the defensesystem.Whenever possible, advance notice of changes should beprovided to the TPT to allow training of personnel prior toimplementation of defense system changes.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200223Training System ConceptIntroductionObjectiveThe development of an overall training system concept is thebeginning of a system-training plan.  This concept serves as thestarting point for all other planning.  It provides the framework todevelop system requirements, resource requirements, etc.The objective of the training system concept is to define thetraining philosophy and policy within which the training systemwill be designed and operated. The training system conceptincludes the characteristics to be exhibited by the overall trainingsystem.Who isresponsible?The operating command, as part of the TPT, is responsible fordeveloping the Training System Concept (TSC).  They will beassisted by:Subject Matter Experts (SME)ContractorsInstructional designersSystem Program Office (SPO) representativeAir Education and Training Command (AETC) representativeOther managers and specialists as requiredWhat is in a TSC?The TSC is purposely broad, but it sets the boundaries withinwhich training system decisions can be made.  It can containitems such as:Training system life cycle master planTraining philosophyType and amount of training that may be neededEstimated funding requirementsEstimated training and support equipment needsType and size of facilities neededEstimated time to develop and deliver the systemProjected impacts on personnelTraining constraintsAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Where to beginThe best way to begin developing a TSC is to reviewpredecessor systems.  Look for similarities and differences.What were the lessons learned from those predecessors?  Nowis the time to identify the expense and time drivers.  Many otherconsiderations must be taken to develop the TSC, which leads toprocess analysis decisions and helps in developing the system-training plan.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200225System Training PlanIntroductionObjectiveThe Training System Concept (TSC) starts the System TrainingPlan (STP).  The training planning team is tasked in AFP 50-11with initiating the STP.  The primary operating command istasked with overall responsibility for the effort.The objective of the STP is to support acquisition andmodification processes, requirements, documents, and milestonedecisions.  The STP also ensures that proper training isidentified as the mission changes, the defense system changes,or the world situation changes.  The STP is a living document.DescriptionThe STP is a life cycle, iterative planning document that definesthe following functions of a training system:DesignDevelopmentFundingResourcesSupportModificationOperationManagementA STP format is available in AFP 50-11.Subset plansThe STP is composed of subset plans for each functional arearequired, such as:OperationsLogisticsSupportIMPACTSThe STP is included in the IMPACTS Program Plan (IPP) as thetraining input and submitted to AF/XO for Air Staff coordination.IPPAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002The STP is submitted as part of the IPP to SAF/AQ prior to eachmilestone decision point, or as required, starting with Milestone 1(see Figure 1).What does the STPdo?The STP will normally:Establish training system definition through acquisition andmodification documentation, which will support the review anddecision process.Identify training needs, concepts, strategies, constraints,risks, data, alternatives, resources, responsibilities, and otherareas, through an iterative process.Document the results of early, front-end, and follow-ontraining task analyses.Provide information and identify resources for managementdecisions within the planning, programming, and budgetingprocess which support defense/training system acquisitionand modification processes.Provide the basic concepts and strategy to attain andmaintain training system concurrency to support desiredtraining capability at the appropriate time.Identify alternate training strategies, to include methodologyand media, if funding, concurrency, or other unknownsnegatively impact required training system capabilities.Establish milestones and schedules to ensure timelydevelopment, testing, and fielding of training capability andtraining support.STP developmentlevelsVarious development levels are required to support milestonedecisions and reviews.  See AFP 50-11 for an outline of STPdevelopment levels.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200227Training Acquisition Strategy AnalysisIntroductionAt this point, when the TPT is formed and the STP is beingwritten, a preliminary decision will be made on whether tocontract for all or parts of the training.  Assuming the decision isto have contractors develop at least a part of the training, thecommand with program management responsibility will developan acquisition strategy.  The acquisition strategy is finalizedbefore each contracted activity.Things to considerIn developing an acquisition strategy, the following should beconsidered by the SPO in coordination with the user:Equipment:Current federal acquisition regulationsFunding availability and constraintsDefense system schedulesComplexity of training systemTypes of training being acquired (operator / maintenance /other)Sole vs. multiple sourcingLease vs. purchasePersonnel:Trained personnel requirementsHow many? and, When needed?On-site training or schoolhouse?One-time course vs. life cycle useTotal contractor training vs. turnkey (using commandoperation)OtherconsiderationsGetting the "big picture" is important in developing theacquisition strategy.  The total training system perspective isneeded to understand its full scope and how the integration willtake place in order to have a fully operational system.  Though acontracted activity may be treated as independent, the tie intothe "big picture" ensures a good fit.

The ISD process is the Air Force tool to ensure thatquality systems are built to the customer’s satisfaction.  It helpsmanagers and training developers build programs that teachwhat Air Force people need to know, when they need to know it,in the most effective and most efficient manner possible.  TheISD process implements all of the principles of the Quality AirForce (QAF) program.Quality is the vehicle to ensure that training systems are builtand delivered customer-centered.What it isQuality improvement (QI) is the continuous, organized creationof beneficial change.  It occurs throughout the ISD process.Quality improvement results in raising student performance (dueto training) to an unprecedented level.Objectives of QIThe objective of QI is to foster continuous improvement in theISD processes and products and to ensure on-time developmentof high-quality courseware that enables students to reach thedesired performance levels in an effective and cost-efficientmanner.  QI occurs throughout the ISD process.Results of QIHigh quality in training product development brings:Increased student satisfactionProducts that are easy to maintainIncreased ability of students to perform a job immediatelyafter trainingHigh quality in training design brings:Fewer errorsLess rework (and waste)More successful trainingLess time spent in developing new productsPotentially lower life cycle costsTest andevaluationAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Test and evaluation is the check to ensure that systemrequirements are met according to the specification.  It is used aspart of the quality process.Quality relationship Customers:Know your customers.  The information gained in themission/job analysis process gives the instructional designteam information that defines the customer’s expectations.Focus on customers.  As mentioned earlier, the needs ofthe work center drives the instructional needs.  By continuingto trace the relationship between the job requirements and allaspects of the instructional program, you maintain a continualfocus on the actual field requirements.  In addition, ISD alsorequires that the capabilities, aptitudes and attitudes of thestudent target population be considered during the designprocess.Team Players:Foster teamwork.  A training program cannot be designedand developed in a vacuum.  In order to develop effectivetraining, the design team must include representatives fromthe work center and evaluation offices.  This helps ensurethat the training matches the performance requirements of thejob.Empower your people.  ISD is a problem solving, decision-making model.  The flexibility of the process, combined withthe fact that there are any number of ways to solve a giventraining problem, requires that design teams be allowedfreedom and authority to design, develop, and implementtraining that meets job performance requirements.Final Product:Know your mission.  ISD depends on mission and jobanalysis for basic data.  All instruction must be based directlyon mission or job requirements.  The checks in the processhelp eliminate instruction not related to the job.Job analysis uses data from many sources, including missionstatements found in regulations or locally developedstatements.  Analysts also make use of managementContinued on next pageAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200239Quality relationship(Continued)engineering reports, occupational survey data, and directobservation to determine the actual job requirements.As part of the job analysis process, a training needsassessment is conducted to arrive at the actual performanceproblem.  In some cases, a problem is not related to lack oftraining, but to a problem with the job structure orenvironment.  The ISD process helps ensure that you don’tbuild a training program for a non-training problem.Set goals and standards.  Goals and standards for aninstructional development effort come in many variations.First, the job requirements and the impact of the performancedeficiency determine the timing required for the developmentprocess and the conduct of the instructional program.Second, the content of the training is determined by the jobperformance requirements.  The design team should directlytranslate the cues, conditions, and performance standards ofthe job directly into the instructional program.Manage by fact.  Each phase of the ISD process requiresconstant evaluation against the job requirements identifiedearlier in the process.  In addition, a variety of tools havebeen developed to help ensure that design and developmentdecisions are made with supporting data.  For example, anumber of media selection tools are being used that providemanagers with information that matches training media withthe training requirements.  These matches are based onlearning theories and development cost factors (money andtime).  ISD is designed to guide managers and developers toawareness of factors affecting their decisions.Integrate quality in all phases.  Evaluation is continuousquality checking.  This is true during each phase of the ISDprocess, from analysis to implementation.  Built-in checks ineach phase ensure the quality of the ISD process andproducts.  The emphasis is on satisfying the job performancerequirements and producing graduates who can do their jobs.Evaluate quality constantly.  The ISD process is a cyclical,ongoing process of continuous improvements.  As curriculumdevelopers progress through the different phases of ISD, theprocess and products of each phase are constantly evaluatedagainst the job requirements and principles of learning.  Theresults of the evaluations determine which phase of ISD toenter next.  Constant evaluation identifies changes in jobrequirements due to updates in equipment and personnel,which results in new ISD efforts to provide the best possibletraining to Air Force personnel.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Basis of processimprovementThe basis of process improvement is Quality Air Force.  QAF is amanagement philosophy and a methodology that work togetherto produce continuous process improvements.  It is based on thefollowing principles.All work is a process.Processes receive work from suppliers, add value, anddeliver output to customers.Anyone from whom a process receives work is a supplier.Anyone to whom a process delivers output is a customer.Customers have needs and expectations.Customers will define and measure quality in terms of thoseneeds and expectations.Quality is meeting customer needs and expectations.Improving process quality increases productivity.Processes can be identified, understood, measured, andimproved.The people who operate the processes know best how toimprove them.Procedure forprocessimprovementIn order to ensure process improvements, you will need to use asystematic method to identify and correct the causes of theproblems.  The six steps of process improvement are outlined inthe following table.StepActivity123456Define the process and determine the main problemareas.Analyze the problems and identify the causes of each.Identify and evaluate possible changes to the process.Implement the changes and monitor the process.Institutionalize the changes.Repeat for continuous improvements.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200241Ways to implementthe procedureThere are many different ways to implement the basic procedurementioned above.

It’s extremely important that ISD interface with otherdefense system acquisition/life cycle support functionscontinuously.  One important way that the ISD process mesheswith the defense system is through interacting with systemengineering.  An "interaction" is a two-way street: ISD andsystem engineering communicate and support each other.  Butwhy is it important and how does it happen?What it isA system is a composite of skilled people and equipment(hardware and software) that provide an operational capability toperform a stated mission.ISD is the systematic process employed to design and developtraining for a defense system.  It is used to identify trainingrequirements, to determine appropriate media for training, and todesign, develop, implement and evaluate training and trainingmaterials for defense systems.The system engineering process is a logical sequence ofactivities and decisions transforming an operational need into adescription of system performance parameters and a preferredsystem configuration.Relationship of ISDand systemengineeringISD and system engineering are two complementary processesthat are used to design and develop training systems for defensesystems.  The processes have many similarities and eachprocess accomplishes functions not accomplished by the other.Importance of ISDto systemengineeringSystem engineering must consider personnel, the skills theyrequire, and the training program to teach these skills as integralparts of the defense system.  Failure to integrate ISD into systemengineering can result in an inadequately supported system.System engineering addresses those training system designissues having to do with translation of training system functionalContinued on next pageAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Importance of ISDto systemengineering(Continued)requirements (stated by ISD) into hardware and software.  Itconsiders the defense system hardware, software, supportequipment, operations, and maintenance concept.  Systemengineering examines new technology, similar systems, andexisting systems to arrive at a functional description of thesystem in terms of hardware and software requirements.  Thesystem engineering process is used to produce the managementand design decisions and data upon which the training system isbased.  ISD alone cannot fulfill all the needs of a total trainingsystem.InteractionISD and system engineering are mutually supporting facets of adefense system acquisition and life cycle.  All individualsinvolved with acquisition must ensure that ISD is considered insystem engineering and vice versa.  Many avenues exist for thisinteraction.  Among them are:Personnel:Training planning teamTechnical interchange meetingsPlans:System training planLogistic support plansTest plansProgram development plansReports:Integrated Manpower, Personnel And ComprehensiveTraining & Safety (IMPACTS)Requests for Proposal (RFP)Other Considerations:Logistic support analysisQuality controlDesign reviewsAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200247IntroductionChapter 3CONTRACTOR-DEVELOPED TRAININGOverviewDuring the first two chapters, you were given a basic backgroundof ISD and were introduced to some of the concepts that apply.It was stressed that ISD is a flexible process, always employingthe principles of continuous or quality improvement.  You haveseen how training system requirements must be considered earlyin the cycle of defense system acquisition.  Teamwork,communication, and coordination have been stressed frequently.But at this point, a contract has not yet been awarded and couldstill be a long time away.  In fact, you learned in the previouschapter that a TPT has been formed and that the TPTdetermines the approach to take for acquiring training to supportthe defense system.  Sometimes it may be in the best interests ofthe Air Force, for the Air Force to develop the trainingthemselves.  If the decision is to have contractors develop all orpart of the training, another series of events, processes andactivities begins, leading to contract award.  It is very importantthat you know what occurs before contract award becauseseveral key program office actions will occur during this time,ultimately affecting the team and the ISD process.PurposeThe purpose of this chapter is to explain the major tasks thatoccur during pre-award of a training system contract and to focuson the contractor and government responsibilities, along with theISD implications.Where to readabout itThis chapter contains four sections.SectionTitleABCDAcquisition PlanningRequest for Proposal DevelopmentProposal WritingSource SelectionPage49545759AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002SpecialconsiderationsAs mentioned above, there will be occasions when it is best forthe Air Force to develop its own training.  One area that needsspecial consideration is Air Force developed maintenancetraining.  Another key consideration is interactive courseware(ICW).  There will be occasions where you will need to acquireICW.  Because of their importance, these two areas are coveredin separate chapters as listed:Chapter TitleAir Force-Developed Maintenance TrainingInteractive Courseware (ICW)Page145159ISD phaseAt this stage, you are conducting planning, preceding theanalysis phase of ISD.  The updated Air Force ISD model isshown in Figure 8.Figure 8 Updated ISD ModelAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200249TaskingThroughout the rest of this handbook, various tasks andresponsibilities will be described.  They will normally be listed aseither "Contractor Tasks" or "Air Force Tasks."  Never assumethat task listings are complete.  As you learned earlier, eachdefense program varies depending on such things as funds,scope and time.  Also, note that while all USAF tasks are listedas "Air Force Tasks," they could be performed by differentagencies of the USAF, again depending on the program.  Forexample, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) mayhave various tasks and other responsibilities at different stagesin the ISD and acquisition phases.  These requirements shouldbe specified and agreed to in a Memorandum of Agreement(MOA) signed by the using command, program office and AETC.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002IntroductionPurposeAcquisition lifecycleSection AAcquisition PlanningA training system concept has been published that describes thedesired overall training philosophy, principles and capabilities.At this point, the Air Force has decided that it will pursue atraining contract and now must take steps to prepare and awarda contract.  Acquisition planning is where considerablecommunication, assessments, strategy sessions and preliminaryplanning will take place.The purpose of acquisition planning is to develop preliminaryconcepts, plans and strategies for the acquisition.  By completingthis task, the Air Force will be assured that the acquisitionstrategy is best suited to the purpose, meets user needs, meetsregulations and other constraints, and ideally "covers all thebases."Before going any further, look again at the diagram of theacquisition life cycle milestones and phases (Figure 9).Acquisition planning is accomplished at each phase.  The moredefined the defense system becomes, the closer ISD activitiescan come to actual training system design.  The ISD analysisphase is typically part of acquisition planning for Phase I and isrepeated again for Phase II.  Although training systems areconsiderations in Phase 0, little ISD analysis is done beforePhase I.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200251Acquisition lifecycle(Continued)Figure 9 System Acquisition Life CycleDeterminationofMission NeedAcquisition Life CycleMilestones and PhasesPhase 0Phase IPhase IIPhase IIIPhase IVConceptExploration andDefinitionDemonstrationandValidationEngineering andManufacturingDevelopmentProductionandDeploymentOperationsandSupportMilestone 0Milestone 1Milestone IIMilestone IIIMilestone IVConceptStudiesApprovalConceptDemonstrationApprovalDevelopmentApprovalProductionApprovalMajorModificationApprovalAs RequiredContractor tasksDuring acquisition planning, the potential contractors are doingeverything possible to learn about the potential contract.

While the potentialcontractors are gathering data and going through their variousactions, the program office is becoming very busy in getting thispotential program moving.  Some actions that they are takinginclude:-  Engage the using command.-  Trigger update of training system concept.-  Get user to define system functional requirements(management, administration, support, delivery of instruction,ISD, QI).-  Engage industry by issuing SFI.-  Perform preliminary program risk assessment.-  Write training system life cycle master plan (top-level systemmanagement strategy).-  Engage Program Element Monitor (PEM).-  Negotiate program-funding profile.-  Define test agency responsibilities.- Identify major program constraints.-  Negotiate Program Management Document (PMD).-  Assess development risk.-  Define acquisition strategy.- Identify alternative acquisition strategies.-  Examine feasibility of a phased approach.-  Define Training System Requirements Analysis (TSRA)requirements.- -  Should there be a separate TSRA contract?-  Lock in strategy at this point.-  Write acquisition plan.If any, which TSRA tasks?-  Write baseline concept description supporting integratedweapon system management.-  Establish SME support principles.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200253Air Force tasks(Continued)Military standardsMIL-HDBK-29612Having been involved up-front with the TPT, AETC could (ifagreed to in Memorandum of Agreement):-  Develop and coordinate AETC participation plan.-  Specify methodology:-  Training development or quality assessment-  Training assessment during Operational Test andEvaluation (OT&E)  (AETC will assess whether themaintenance program meets user needs)-  Specify personnel and other resources.-  List data requirements.-  Review listing of data items to be considered when a new AirForce training program or course is to be developed undercontract.-  Review MIL-STD-1388-2A and -2B for Logistics SupportAnalysis (LSA) data requirements.You read that AETC is reviewing military standards (MIL-STD).MIL-STDs are documents issued within the Department ofDefense (DoD) in accordance with the basic policy of theDefense Standardization Program (MIL-STD-962).  MIL-STDsestablish engineering and technical requirements for items,equipment, processes, procedures, practices and methods thathave been adopted as standards.  MIL-HDBK-29612 is formilitary training programs.Since MIL-HDBK-29612 is limited in scope, you need to refer toAttachment C to understand the cross-walk for total trainingsystems acquisition (AFMC/ASC process) and MIL-HDBK-29612.The ultimate goal of MIL-HDBK-29612 is to enable theGovernment to identify more accurately the data or informationthat the Government must have to fulfill a training requirement.Because the standard has been prepared for joint service use,understanding how to tailor the task descriptions and datarequirements cited in MIL-HDBK-29612 is critical.  Failure totailor accurately and intelligently will result in performance oftasks and purchase of data that either extend significantlybeyond the minimum scope of the original training requirement ordo not meet the needs of the end user, while unnecessarilyescalatingContinued on next pageAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002MIL-HDBK-29612(Continued)the cost.

Data plans may indicate aneed to use consolidated DIDs or use a one-time DID writtenspecifically for the program.  You can contact your trainingengineering support office for assistance in tailoring the RFP tomeet your acquisition strategy.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200255Section BRequest for Proposal DevelopmentIntroductionInitial planning for contract development has been completedand revisions will be ongoing based on training system conceptupdates, training system life cycle master plan, risk and strategydocuments.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) must now bedeveloped.What it isThe RFP is an acquisition package soliciting design anddevelopment proposals for new or updated systems fromcontractors.  The document generally consists of:Executive summaryInstructions to offerersRequirements documentsStatement of workContract Data Requirements List (CDRL)Model contractOther special itemsThe release of the RFP is the official start of the contractingprocess.Contractor tasksDuring this stage, the potential contractors are continuing theirintelligence gathering operations and trying to "scope out" thepotential contract as much as possible.  They have now begun totalk with SPO personnel concerning:Specific requirements"Show stoppers"Government prejudices or peculiaritiesNote: Sometimes the Air Force will issue a draft RFP to potentialcontractors to get them more in line with the acquisition strategyand to give the contractors an opportunity to give feedback to theAir Force.  The draft RFP is not binding in any manner.  A seconddraft release before final RFP clarifies any misunderstandingsbefore going into source selection rules.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Contractor tasks(Continued)If a draft RFP has been received, the potential contractors will:Review and comment on the RFP.Attempt to influence Government (not to give them thecontract, but to make various changes to the specificationssuch as to improve performance, cost, and quality).Negotiate potential teaming agreements.Generate preliminary system design.Air Force tasksThe program office is now busy writing various documentsspecifying system functional requirements, reflecting the user’srequirements and constraints.  These include:System Requirements Document (SRD)Statement of work inputsInstructions to offerersRequirements correlation matrixIn addition, Acquisition Strategy Panel (ASP) decisions affectingthe Training System Requirements Analysis (TSRA) aredocumented.  These include:Reasons for doing TSRAHow results precede and feed subsequent program phasesRationale for separate TSRA contract or pursuit of phasedprogramIf tasked, AETC will also develop a "strawman" concept ofsystem life cycle training using their experience and familiaritywith similar systems.  For example, the "strawman" concept of lifecycle training will include AETC’s estimate of:Training requirements for the life cycle of the defense systemRecommended training methods and mediaAnticipated levels of the training needed by the workforceSpecific Air Force specialties needing trainingCareer point at which the training will likely be requiredContinued on next pageAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200257Air Force tasks(Continued)This "strawman" training concept will be used as a baseline forcomparison of the contractor proposals.  In many respects the"strawman" concepts cover many of the same areas that wouldbe covered in the early development stages of a system-trainingplan.AETC could also review the draft RFP for concerns such as thefollowing:Requirements:Are overall data requirements adequate?Is the contractor required to warrant data for accuracy andcompleteness?Have Government Furnished Property (GFP) andGovernment Furnished Equipment (GFE) been clearlyidentified?Are requirements for government quality assuranceincluded?If Computer-Based Instruction (CBI) is required, has itbeen considered as an acquisition?Other Considerations:Are milestones related to the defense system eventsrather than calendar dates?Have availability and supportability of GFP/GFE beenplanned?Have technical data requirements been included?Is digitized data or Computer-Aided Acquisition LogisticsSupport (CALS) considered?Have facilities and classrooms been considered?(Facilities must be considered up front as part of theacquisition.)AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002IntroductionSection CProposal WritingA lot of work has gone into acquisition planning and RFPdevelopment to produce a draft RFP.  Now the RFP will berefined, rewritten in final form and distributed, and potentialcontractors will write and submit proposals.  The contractor willgo through many steps to ensure that the proposal is the bestdocument possible, reflects the contractor’s capabilities, and is ata fair, competitive price.  To write the proposal, the contractormust ensure that several actions are done.Note: Before the final RFP is delivered to the potentialcontractors, the SPO and using commands will sponsor bidders’conferences to review the draft RFP and conduct question andanswer sessions.  Once this is completed and draft RFPshortfalls are remedied, the formal RFP is delivered.  A seconddraft RFP ensures that remedies are satisfactory before finalRFP release.PurposeThe purpose of proposal writing is for industry to prepare adocument for the Air Force.  The document should convince theAF contracting officer that the contractor’s company can producethe best quality product that meets or exceeds the minimumrequirements, within specifications, at a fair price, and will bedelivered on time.Contractor tasksIn the proposal, the contractor must show an understanding ofthe requirements and the intent to comply.  The contractor mustalso include a top-level training system specification showingallocated functional requirements.  Source data requirementsand tasks must be identified to include:Identification of associate contractor agreementsIdentification of simulator data integrity standardsContinued on next pageAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200259Contractor tasks(Continued)The first major product that the potential contractor prepares isthe top-level System Engineering Management Plan (SEMP).This includes plans for development of:HardwareSoftwareCoursewareFirmwareIn addition, the contractor will prepare the System EngineeringMaster Schedule (SEMS), write training system specifications,and identify source data requirements.Air Force tasksThe SPO will conduct bidders’ conferences, discussing draftproposals with the contractor.  The SPO will write evaluationstandards and identify the source selection team.  The usingcommands and AETC will support the SPO at the bidders’conferences as required.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Section DSource SelectionSynopsisAt this stage, the Air Force will review all proposals usingguidance developed by the SPO.  The using commands andAETC should participate in this process.  During this process, theAir Force will try to determine the contractor’s understanding ofthe total system functional integration.  The using commands willensure that the training concepts are understood and representusers’ interests.Air Force tasksSource selection will follow a predetermined and documentedschedule of activities. The SPO, working with the using commandand AETC, will review many areas. Some questions they mayask include the following.FeasibilityCan the contractor really do what is proposed in a qualityfashion within schedule and budget?ConformanceDoes the proposal meet requirements of the RFP?Coverage of User RequirementsWill this training satisfy the customer?Is it what the customer "ordered?"ConsistencyIs planned training consistent with defense system operationand maintenance concepts?The SPO will also conduct a training system capability andcapacity review, if appropriate.Contract awardAfter all the above actions are completed and preview stepssatisfied, a contract is awarded.   Once the contract is awarded,considerable work will begin using the ISD process.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200261Chapter 4PLANNINGOverviewIntroductionPurposeWhile reading about the total training system earlier (page 15),you learned that a key ingredient to success is planning.Planning in defense system acquisition consists of many tasksthat occur early in the acquisition cycle and continue throughoutall phases.The purpose of this chapter is to explain the major tasks inperforming planning.  While you will not become a planningexpert by reading this chapter, you will know the concepts andprocesses necessary for success.Where to readabout itThis chapter contains three sections.SectionTitleABCAssess Instructional NeedsDevelop Overall OutlineDefine Planning RequirementsPage636567AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Which ISD phase?You have not yet entered an ISD phase but are doing preliminarywork.  You are still in a planning stage, focusing on training whilein the management function.  This function is highlighted inFigure 10.Figure 10 Updated ISD ModelContractor tasksSince the defense system contractor has been contracted toproduce and deliver a system, that contractor plays a large rolein planning for training.  The contractor is responsible forconducting all the steps in planning while coordinating with theprogram office and primary operating commands.  Theacquisition contract may be for courseware or devices, on-sitetraining, type 1 training, or a total training system. (Forinformation about type 1 training, see AFI 36-2201.)AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200263Air Force tasksThroughout the planning stage, the program office will review allcontractor products and design decisions, working with thecontractor informally to make required changes, while elevatingareas of concern.The primary operating command supports the contractor withSME advisors from staff, line and supporting positions; theyadvise regarding training doctrine and provide the practical fieldexperience.Air Education and Training Command provides support, asrequested, by reviewing contractor products and elevatingconcerns.  Specific areas of interest to AETC are discussed laterin this chapter.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Section AAssess Instructional NeedsIntroductionInstructional need has been defined many ways but is generallyconsidered to be the discrepancy or gap between desiredperformance and current performance.  In the acquisitionbusiness, it is defined as the process of identifying the problem,documenting any shortfall and developing a solution.An instructional need exists when anemployee lacks the necessary knowledge,skills or attitudes to perform a requiredPurposeThe purpose of assessing instructional needs is to validate aneed for training in a defense system acquisition.Stages ofassessinginstructional needsThe three basic stages of assessing instructional needs are:Define the problem.Document the deficiency.Develop the solution.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200265Basic steps ofanalysisThe three overall stages can be broken down into six or morebasic steps.  You can modify these as necessary.Step123456Analysis ActivityDefine the Objectives.  Why are you doing theanalysis?  What is your goal?Identify Data Requirements.  What kind of datawill you need to review to conduct the analysis?Select Methods of Gathering Data.  How will youobtain the data you need?  Examples are:•  Use questionnaires.•  Make observations.•  Conduct interviews.•  Review records/reports.•  Analyze work samples.•  Conduct tests.Gather Data.  Obtain, organize and catalog data.Conduct Analysis of Data.  How does this datacompare with skills required?  Is your dataaccurate?  Should you double check and verify?Prepare Reports.  What reports are required?Where do you submit them?  Is any follow-uprequired?  Did you meet your objectives?  Whatkind of training is required?AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002IntroductionWhat it isStructureHow to develop anoutlineSection BDevelop Overall OutlineAt this point in the planning phase, you have assessedinstructional needs and determined that there will be a trainingrequirement for the product that you are acquiring.  But you havealso found out that this "product" will create a lot of unknowns inthe training and support areas if you don’t get a handle on it now.For these reasons, you need to develop an overall outline.An overall outline is defined as a macro, rough profile of what’sgoing on and what needs to be done.  This outline gives the "bigpicture" of the entire training system.There is no required structure to the outline.  It will varydepending on the size and complexity of the system beingacquired and the training required.The best way to start in developing the outline is to review thecontract and the SOW.  Developing the outline is similar todeveloping a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).  A WBS is ahierarchical ordering of work activities and products which isused in detailed planning of work activity units and in costing forproposals and contracts.  Your outline need not be as detailed asa WBS, but the areas to consider are similar.  Begin with thetraining system at the top.  Next, list broad categories of thingsthat comprise the system.  Then consider each of these thingsand list the activities that go into them.  Continue this "pyramidbuilding" until the desired level of detail is reached.What to considerItems to consider could include, but are not limited to:Objective:Training equipmentCoursewareTrained personnel requirementsContinued on next pageAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200267What to consider(Continued)Support equipmentTraining sitesFacilitiesUse of operational aircraft/equipmentAircraft data/partsSubjective:InstructorsDefense system schedulesTest plansDesired instructional approachOther conditionsWhen developing the outline, consider how the components ofthe training system interrelate with each other and the defensesystem.  Progress, delays or changes in the defense system willhave an effect on the training system and vice versa.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Section CDefine Planning RequirementsIntroductionNow that you have an outline of the "big picture," you need todefine planning requirements.  The training development processmay require more than one plan. But don’t let this scare youaway.  If done correctly, the selected plans will follow an orderlyprocess and will fit into the overall picture like pieces of a puzzle.A "plan" can be a one-page document or a 200-page binder.  Itdepends on the system, the program and the subject.Where to startIn defining planning requirements, the first question to ask is:"What plans will be required?"Questions toanswerIf you can answer the question above, you are on the right track.If you cannot, then further study may be necessary.  Find theanswers to questions such as:What activities need advance preparation?What do you need to know and have in place in order to dothese activities?Is this information needed for the training systemimplementation plan?Is this information needed for the System EngineeringManagement Plan (SEMP)?Will there be a courseware/ISD development plan to guideyour process?How will you know the training system quality?Will you need a test and evaluation plan?Who developsplans?After answering the above questions, you can concentrate on therequired plans.  You need to remember that no single persondevelops all plans.  In a major acquisition, there will be severalpersonnel or several teams of Air Force and contractor personneldeveloping plans at any given time.Remember to coordinate and communicate.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200269Example plansYou touched on some plans that may be important.  Some plansyou may see are:System training planTraining system implementation planSEMPCourseware/ISD development planTraining system test and evaluation planISD management planAir Force tasksDuring and following the planning phase, the following actionswill occur.  The SPO will:Review all contractor products and design decisions.Work with the contractor to effect required changes.Elevate areas of concern.The using command will:Provide SME support as required. (SMEs could be utilizedfrom all applicable positions, such as staff, line and supportpositions.)AETC will review the ISD management plan to ensure that:ISD methodology provides for sound, objective, systematic,and traceable training decisions.Contractor-planned training meets user-defined requirements.AETC will also identify areas for comparative analysis.DataThe contractor may deliver the various plans in accordance withthe contract, but plans will normally be delivered following theplanning stage.  This will include the ISD management plan andthe training system implementation plan.MetricsAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Metrics are standards of measurement or quality indicators thatare critical in the acquisition and ISD processes.  The purpose ofmetrics is to give qualitative and quantitative evaluations ofprocesses and products throughout the development ofcourseware.  Acquisition metrics track key factors such as cost,schedule, and performance.  Types of metrics include:QualitativeQuality assuranceEvaluation criteriaSubject matter expert reviewQuality controlTraceabilityFormat guideQuantitativePersonnel/skill allocationScheduleTracking by lessonAction itemsTest and evaluation dataInstructionalsystems metricsoverviewFigure 11 represents a typical metrics development andmeasurement process.

The first application of metrics applieshere, following completion of various planning activities.Metrics in planning Earlier in this chapter, you were advised of the Air Force tasks.In completing these tasks, the Air Force needs to considerperforming the following activities:-  Review all TSRA deliverables incrementally as drafts arewritten.-  Compare percentage of completion of draft products vs.completion timeline/milestones.-  Evaluate percentage/amount and types of personnelproposed for each development phase vs. AF experiencebase.  Has the contractor budgeted personnel for thecorrections required following individual tryouts?AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Chapter 5ANALYSISOverviewIntroductionYou should now have available the system training plan or theISD management plan.In analysis, the Air Force conducts assessments or monitorsinstructional designers as they conduct various analyses such asmission analysis, task analysis, and media analysis.PurposeThe purpose of this chapter is to describe:-  Types of analyses and when they should be conducted-  Related plan updatesWhere to readabout itThis chapter contains eight sections.SectionTitleABCDEFGHMission AnalysisTask AnalysisTraining Requirements AnalysisObjectives AnalysisMedia AnalysisCost AnalysisTraining System Basis AnalysisPreliminary SyllabusPage7374767981848790AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200273ISD phaseYou are now in the analysis phase.

A missionanalysis will provide basic data on system functions, types ofequipment, maintenance requirements, educational goals andother information.What it isMission Analysis is defined as a process of reviewing missionrequirements, developing collective task statements, andarranging the collective tasks in a hierarchical relationship.Contractor tasksMany tasks are conducted during a mission analysis.  Sometasks will occur concurrently, others subsequently.  These taskscan include the following:Collect mission data.Perform literature search.Conduct interviews.Conduct on-site visits/reviews.Compare new system to existing system.Compare new system to similar system.Document mission descriptions.Create traceability database.Air Force tasksDuring this stage, the SPO will continue dialogue with thecontractor, reviewing products and giving guidance as necessary.As delegated, the user and AETC will review contractordeliverables for validity, process conformance, technicalaccuracy and completeness.DataA report is due at the completion of task analysis, which isdiscussed in the next section.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200275Section BTask AnalysisIntroductionEvery job in the Air Force consists of tasks that comprise the job.The goal of task analysis is to zero in on the target population orthe group needing to be trained and determine what they need inorder to do the job.What it isThe best way to define task analysis is to break it down into twoparts.Job Task Analysis - A process of examining a specific job toidentify all the duties and tasks that are performed by the jobincumbent at a given skill level.Training Task Analysis - The process of examining eachunique unit of work from the job task analysis to derivedescriptive information used in the design, development, andtesting of training products.Contractor tasksTask analysis is a more in-depth analysis compared to missionanalysis.  It is a further breakout, narrowing the analysis to therequired tasks.  It includes the following activities:Identify tasks for each mission.Describe critical functions.Generate task lists based on defense system crewcomposition.Document crewmember qualification levels.Create preliminary task hierarchical list.Document expected performance required for each task.Trace tasks back to mission descriptions (using database).Air Force tasksThe SPO will continue dialogue with the contractor, reviewingproducts and giving guidance as necessary.  The SPO willreview and approve the reports as appropriate.  They will reviewthe reports for accuracy, ensure that task lists are complete, andverify that correct "assumptions" were made.  The SMEs willevaluate draft deliverables from the perspective of the usingcommand requirements.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Air Force tasks(Continued)Training analysts review for compliance with DIDs and requiredprocesses.  They will also review to ensure that traceability hasbeen maintained throughout the Training System RequirementsAnalysis process (as discussed in Chapter 2).DataFollowing completion of mission and task analysis, a report isrequired.  The report should contain items such as:Mission Items:ObjectiveScenarioSegmentsProfileMap descriptionsOther items:Graph descriptionsSystem and operator requirementsDetailed task analysisTask analysis recordMaster task listingAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200277Section CTraining Requirements AnalysisIntroductionWhen a new or modified defense system is being designed anddeveloped, training impacts must be considered throughout theprocess.  As you know, no system is fully functional without thetrained personnel to operate, maintain, and support it.  Ideally,the mission and task analyses have been performed or are in astage of completion.  Now the training requirements analysisbegins.PurposeThe purpose of the training requirements analysis is to developthe training task list.  These are the tasks for which the studentlacks the skills, knowledge, or attitudes in order to perform them.How is a task listdeveloped?To develop a task list:First conduct a target population analysisData determines types of students entering the trainingsystem and their current skills/knowledge/attitudesPerform a breakdown of skills, knowledge and attitudes todetermine which skills, knowledge and attitudes is performed.Determining which skills can be trained in what setting.This breakdown will be a key factor in conducting objectivesanalysis (Section D).Who develops it?The contractor normally develops the analysis with input fromSMEs.Contractor tasksConducting early training requirements analysis, including anypreliminary analysis during concept development, will helpensure that the following tasks are done.Assess and analyze:Assess potential sources of students.Assess students’ knowledge and education.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Contractor tasks(Continued)Analyze pertinent data on unique student characteristics tocompare with job expectations.Assess life cycle training and support impact.Create and Document:Finalize procedure for defining training requirement.Create final training task hierarchy list.Document findings by writing Training Requirements AnalysisReport (TRAR).Document in a database, tracing requirements back tomission descriptions.Determine:Identify target population (potential students).Determine student experience level.Identify students’ current proficiency and qualifications.Define increase needed in skills, knowledge, and attitudes(SKA).Define performance factors and qualification levels forterminal objectives.Air Force tasksThe SPO will review the report, comment and approve, asappropriate.  The user will:Conduct comparative analysis for comparison to contractor-performed analysis results.Review contractor-training decisions for traceability,completeness, accuracy and reasonableness.Check that target population definition is correct.Verify that performance factors reflect valid performancerequirements.DataFollowing the above actions, the contractor will deliver the TRARand other documentation in accordance with the contract.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200279MetricsThe Air Force will be performing continual risk assessment andcomparing:Technical staffing vs. planDifferences between planned vs. actual completionQuality factors for products or processesAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Section DObjectives AnalysisIntroductionPurposeTraining objectives are the framework in which training systemsare designed and developed.  The objectives are directed atmeeting all training requirements.  The achievement of thetraining objectives makes up the difference in knowledge, skills,and attitudes needed by the target population to do the job.The purpose of conducting objectives analysis is to clearly statetraining requirements in terms of conditions, standards, andbehaviors, and arrange them in a logical and effective sequence.This becomes very important when structuring the coursesyllabus and developing the courseware.How is itdeveloped?There is no "concrete" way to organize training objectives.Objectives are organized in the most effective and efficient wayto conduct training.  There are several recommended tasks in anobjectives analysis.Who develops it?The training system requirements analysis contractor performsthe objectives analysis with input from SMEs.Contractor tasksThe contractor will complete many tasks at this stage, including:Develop objectives, including:Top LevelTerminalPrimaryLower LevelEnablingSecondarySupportingSubordinateDevelopmentalContinued on next pageAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200281Contractor tasks(Continued)Translate training requirements into objectives for eachqualification level reflecting:BehaviorConditionsStandardsDocument objectives hierarchy.Using database, trace objectives back to missiondescriptions.Sort/organize objectives into hierarchy for each crewmemberposition.Create flow chart for subordinate/superordinate relationships.Describe qualification levels.Document analysis.Air Force tasksThe SPO will:Review rationale, justification, and traceability of the trainingobjectives hierarchy.Continue working with the contractor, giving guidance asrequired.Review and approve any objectives and media reports.Through SMEs, review and coordinate the training objectiveshierarchy, as well as the task analysis process.DataThe contractor will deliver documentation in accordance with thecontract.  This will probably not occur until completion of mediaanalysis, which is described in the next section.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002IntroductionWhat it isHow is itdeveloped?Section EMedia AnalysisInstructional media refers to the different means used to giveinformation to the student.  Different types of media have variouslevels of effectiveness, depending on the complexity of thesubject being taught.  Media analyses must be conducted toensure that the most effective media are used to efficiently meetthe training requirements.Definitions of media vary, but for purposes of this section, mediarefers to a channel of communication utilized to aid learning.Types of media vary from instructor-based to full missionsimulation.Media analysis is defined as the process of examining mediarequirements and assembling a data bank of information to usefor selecting appropriate media for use in instruction.Media analysis is not a straightforward process.  It is an iterativeprocess with various media tradeoffs made prior to determiningthe media pool.  The media pool is the agreed-upon set fromwhich media will be selected.  The "preferred" media areselected and scrutinized against possible tradeoffs such as cost,logistics, maintenance support and facilities.   Consistency ofmedia is also an important consideration.  The goal is an optimalmedia solution that is feasible to implement within the trainingsystem design.Who develops it?The contractor conducts media analysis, with some input fromSMEs.  The contractor normally uses training analysts andsystems engineers in the effort.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200283Contractor tasksMedia analysis can be a very detailed process and will varydepending on the program.  The contractor will complete taskssuch as the following:Conduct surveys of:Instructional systemsEducational technologiesAuthoring systemsDefine student evaluation techniques.Select media allocation model (if applicable).Conduct media trade study.Analyze media training effectiveness.Allocate candidate media in matrix.Using database, trace media allocations back to missiondescriptions.Analyze instructional strategy alternatives.Develop global instructional strategy.Identify levels of courseware required for computer-basedtraining (CBT).Document analysis.Air Force tasksThe SPO has continued dialogue and guidance with thecontractor.   The SPO will ensure that documentation meetsrequirements.  They will again ensure that objectives aretraceable to and support valid training requirements.  They willalso check for:Logical objective grouping.Correct objective flow.Verification that all training requirements are covered byobjectives.Appropriate media selections for skills taught (with specialattention to use of operational aircraft and hardware).Validity of functional and physical fidelity requirements.Validity of media selections and training requirements.Assurance that operational equipment is considered in mediaanalysis.Assurance that AF technical training centers equipment andmedia needs are addressed.Assurance that if CBT is selected as media, it is procured aspart of the acquisition.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Steps to mediaselectionThe above list can be summarized in the following steps to selectmedia.Develop a list of possible media.Review constraints relative to cost, time, availability,resources, etc.Evaluate media needs relative to content, objectives,instructional strategies, teaching methods, and organizationalpatterns.Verify that media are compatible with other AF systems andstandards.Eliminate media not matching your needs.Verify/revise remaining media options.Select the best media match.Foolproof?  Absolutely not!  The choice is yours and theparameters depend on the contract and course objectives.DataA training media analysis report will be delivered in accordancewith the contract.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200285IntroductionPurposeWhat it isSection FCost AnalysisTo make intelligent decisions about the selection of a system tofulfill a specific need, you must look beyond the immediate costof developing and producing that system.  You must look atvarious alternatives in training approaches.  You learned earlierabout media analysis and various factors you must consider.Closely interrelated with that is cost analysis.  In cost analysis,you analyze not only instructional media but also life cycle costssuch as operations, maintenance and support.  A system that isinitially more expensive may be less expensive in the long term.But the reverse tends to be true.  Also, the cheapest up-frontsystem generates more support costs and sometimes even moreremedial and follow-on training costs.The reason you must conduct cost analysis is to make sure youare acquiring the best long-term value by performing acomparative evaluation of potential instruction methods andmedia to determine the most efficient alternative.You learned earlier that the types of media are defined as thedelivery vehicles for presenting instructional material to studentsto induce learning.Additionally, training effectiveness analysis is defined as theprocess of measuring and integrating the training effectivenessand the cost effectiveness of existing and/or proposed alternativetraining system configurations and components in order todetermine the optimal mix of new training system components, orto evaluate and improve existing training systems.  In otherwords, to determine the most effective training for the moneyavailable.Training strategy is defined as the logical arrangement ofcourse content within a pattern or organization, which will likelycause the most learning to occur.  It includes the purpose, targetaudience, content outline, interaction, feedback, testing,audiovisual options, and other data.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002BackgroundYour goal should be to determine the most effective and efficienttraining possible.  There are alternatives for nearly all trainingstrategies.  You may not want to use alternatives, but funding orscheduling may force you to.  The best-planned trainingstrategies sometimes are changed due to design, schedule orother modifications.  That is why you must analyze life cyclecosts compared to training strategy alternatives.  It is alwaysbetter to be prepared up front.How to preparecost analysisDepending on the training system program being worked, costanalysis could be performed in a manual mode or by utilizingautomated cost analysis models.  Cost analysis can be a time-consuming process that, if done properly, will pay long-termdividends.  Figure 13 is a simplification of what is involved in costanalysis.Figure 13 Cost AnalysisStartIdentifyProblemIdentifyData NeedsCollectDataRevisit ProcessAs NecessaryFormConclusionAnalyzeDataAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200287What is included?The first step in the process is to identify the problem.  The word"problem" may be a misnomer in that what you really have at thispoint is a "challenge."  Your challenge is: "Do we use classroominstruction or CBT, videotape, or ICW?  Or do we use a simulatoror actual operational hardware?  What is the student load?"Once you identify the problems, you must identify what data willbe needed, how to collect the data, and so on.  These steps canbe modified and expanded as necessary to support the task athand.Final reportWhen you have finished the process, you will have developed acost analysis report that identifies the best strategy to take toutilize the most efficient and effective training available.Contractor tasksThe contractor will analyze life cycle costs versus:Training effectivenessMedia alternativesTraining strategy alternativesThey will also document cost analysis in the training systembasis analysis report.Air Force tasksFollowing completion of the cost analysis, the SPO continuesdialogue and guidance with the contractor.  They will review costanalysis documents to ensure that:Comparisons are appropriate.Trade-offs are properly considered and analyzed.Analyses are unbiased.Factors used are complete, appropriate and realistic.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002IntroductionPurposeSection GTraining System Basis AnalysisIn the planing phase of ISD, you developed a "big picture" outlineof instructional needs and potentially required plans.  Youidentified what plans would probably be required and identifiedelements of the training system implementation plan.  Amongother things, you decided if there would be a courseware/ISDdevelopment plan.  The training system basis analysis (TSBA) isone of the activities in this phase.The purpose of the TSBA is to develop the training systemconcept and define the training system configuration.  The TSBAreport documents existing training programs and establishes thefunctional baseline for the design, development, and operation ofan integrated training system.  The report is used to definetraining capabilities and establish system requirements for thetraining system.Contractor tasksThe contractor will review and update previous work in planningand analysis to complete the following requirements.New Items:Write development plans for the instructional system and forcourseware.Define training system conduct.Assess training technologies (incorporate media analysisfrom objectives and media analysis).Perform problem analysis.Develop success criteria for:Course Readiness Review (CRR).Site Readiness Review (SRR).Training System Readiness Review (TSRR).Using database, trace system requirements back tomission descriptions.Validate requirements analysis database traceability.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200289Contractor tasks(Continued)Continuing items:Update training system implementation plan.Document existing training system.Document similar training system.Document inputs for System Requirements Document (SRD).Document analysis.Air Force tasksThe SPO will continue to work with the contractor throughout thisprocess, and must review contractor intermediate products,elevating any areas of concern.  Once the report is delivered, theSPO will review and approve as appropriate.  The SPO will also:Identify any new requirements and changes reflected in top-level program documents such as:Using command(s) system training plan(s)Operational readiness documentPrevious TSRA productsProgram management directiveNew constraints such as:Cost changesSchedule changesSite changesSystem changesVerify that all valid training requirements are covered.Verify that all system requirements are traceable to validtraining requirements.Check to make sure that if success criteria are met, they willensure success.The using command(s) will support the SPO as necessary andwill support a MOA for SME use.Note:  If this contract is not a single, total system development,the SPO must:Write a new RFP.Write SRD providing a functional description of allrequirements for the total training system (single-contractprograms only).  This includes student input/output.Estimate SME requirements.Negotiate MOA with using command(s).DataAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002The contractor delivers documentation according to the contract.This documentation, such as a report, may tie together andintegrate all previous training system requirements analysismajor activities.  This report can cover:Planning and scheduling considerationsAnalytical processDesign goals and requirements selectionTSBA report results such as:Information sources and data collectionExisting training system analysisSimilar system analysisTraining technology assessmentProblem analysisAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200291Section HPreliminary SyllabusIntroductionPurposeNow a preliminary syllabus will be developed.  A preliminarysyllabus puts into an outline the "big picture" of the trainingsystem in a "real world" context.The purpose of the preliminary syllabus is to develop anddocument a detailed outline of the overall structure of theinstruction.  The preliminary syllabus will provide a master planthat describes how the training system configuration and overalltraining concept will be used.Contractor tasksUsing the previously developed guidance, such as the variousplans, analyses, objectives and media analyses, an unrestrainedsyllabus is developed.  This unrestrained document looks at thebig picture, covering the entire training system. The goal is to letnothing be overlooked.  To develop an unrestrained syllabus, thecontractor must:Cluster/sequence objectives.Define course structure.Define course times.Develop course maps.Once this is done, constraints must be applied and the targetmust be narrowed to best fit the objectives.  The contractor must:Update media allocation matrix.Show course times.Indicate facility needs.Once constraints are applied, document the preliminary syllabuswhile tracing syllabus elements back to mission descriptions.  It’simportant that a database be used for this to ease reference andtracking in the future.The final step in this area is to write a comprehensive syllabusreport and identify lessons for prototyping.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Air Force tasksThe primary job of the using command at this point is to updatethe STP.  The SMEs will review the preliminary syllabus toensure that their objectives are part of the syllabus.As the contractor develops preliminary syllabus documents, theprogram office reviews the products, giving guidance asnecessary.  The final step for the SPO is to review and approvethe preliminary syllabus.AETC will review the preliminary syllabus for:Logical flowCoverage of all valid training requirementsDataA syllabus development report is delivered as required by thecontract.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200293Chapter 6DESIGNOverviewIntroductionYou are now proceeding into the design phase of ISD.  This is agood time to remember that you should never consider that theplanning and analysis phases are overThe various phases of ISD arenever complete.While you may go progressively from one phase to the next, youwill periodically revisit a phase to update a plan, add somethingyou overlooked, or make mid-course corrections.  As mentionedin Chapter 1:ISD is flexible and is not a step-by-step linear process.But, now that you have developed plans and conducted variousanalyses, it is time to start designing instruction.PurposeThe purpose of this chapter is to describe the ISD design phaseand the various applications that are specific to acquisition of adefense system.Where to readabout itThis chapter contains five sections.SectionTitleABCDEStart of DevelopmentGuidance ConferencesSystem-Level Development PlansCourseware Planning Leading toSystem Readiness ReviewDevelopment ActivitiesPage949596100103ISD phaseAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Now you are at the design phase.  This phase is highlighted inFigure 14.Figure 14 Design PhaseAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200295Section AStart of DevelopmentIntroductionContractor tasksThis section is included to cover the situations where a TrainingSystem Requirements Analysis (TSRA) is not done, or was doneby a separate contractor.  If the prior TSRA was conducted aspart of a single contract, you can skip this section if that contractallows the contractor to proceed into development.Note: Although you are in the design phase, some developmentactions take place.As mentioned, if prior tasks were performed as part of a singlecontract for total system development, nothing happens at thisstage.  But if prior tasks were performed as part of a stand-aloneTSRA or of a multi-phased development, the contractor uses theTSRA results and prepares a proposal.The contractor will write a new system specification as part of theproposal.Air Force tasksIf prior tasks were performed as part of a single contract for totalsystem development, nothing happens here.If prior tasks were performed as part of a stand-alone TSRA or ofa multi-phased development, this is the point of a new solicitation(see note on page 88).  The program office will then generate:New RFPNew SRD (if required)New source selectionNew contract awardIf a new RFP is required, the using command will support thesource selection actions.If AETC performs ISD (such as in maintenance training), trainingequipment functional specifications will be provided to the SPO.The SPO will then develop an RFP from the functionalspecifications.  When the RFP is issued, contractor involvementbegins.

Based on thesepreliminary reviews and using the various plans and analysisstages, detailed system level development plans will now bewritten.The purpose of these plans is to have "road maps" or guides,listing various goals and procedures to follow.  While ISD in itselfis not linear, some of the components of ISD must be followed ina linear process for successful goal accomplishment.  Plans thatare contractual will "direct."  Those not contractual will "guide."Contractor tasksThe main goal of this stage is to get the contractor to write, or insome cases, update, system level development plans.  One ofthe largest plans to be written is the SEMP.  The SEMP includes,but is not limited to:Engineering:System engineering organization (how hardware, softwareand course organizations interact)System engineering detail schedule (how used)How the work breakdown structure is used by engineeringSecurity issues:Planned trade-off studies and analysesRisk management planSystem security planIntegration of reliability, safety, environment, etc.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Contractor tasks(Continued)Organized input:Incorporation of Integrated Logistic Support (ILS)Technical Performance Measures (TPM)SEMS (how used)Other Issues:Transition to manufacturingTraining program metrics (processes and products)Use of working groupsBaseline control proceduresConduct of design and technical management reviewsUse of prototypesOther information as requiredOther plans that may be required, depending on the contract andsystem, include:Software development planHardware development planConfiguration management planCourseware development planSource data management practices:Weapon system data support planRequired data flow across training systemStrategy for data holes and deficienciesAssociate contractor agreementsSME roles and responsibilities (system-wide)Training System Implementation Plan (TSIP):Transition plan (from previous training system to newsystem)Life cycle operations and maintenance planPersonnel plans for operations and maintenanceEquipment plan:StorageUtilizationMaintenanceStudent grading and evaluation planTraining materials management planFacilities management planInstructor and student utilization, training and schedulingplanAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 200299Air Force tasksThe SPO will also review for disconnects between contractorplans/schedules and training need dates for:Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E)Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E)Initial cadreFollow-on trainingInitial Operational Capability (IOC)Required Assets Available (RAA)The program office will also review for disconnects between:Facilities plansFunding plans/levelsPersonnel plans/levelsTraining dates (do they match required delivery date [RDD]?)The using command needs to review the revised SME supportMOA and support or negotiate it as required.As the contractor is writing and/or delivering applicable plans,the program office should be conducting a "big picture" review.At this point, the SPO must ensure that the total training systemfunctional requirements and integration are defined for allConfiguration Items (CI).

This tryout is conducted on-site inthe real environment, using real students, full classes and allrequired media.The purpose is to fully test the training system, identifyingdiscrepancies and remedying as necessary.  It also validates thetraining system’s capability to accommodate incremental andsystematic integration of all components of a training systemwithout degradation to system performance and trainingeffectiveness.Contractor tasksThe contractor will conduct the tryout in a guaranteed studentprogram.  The contractor will support the Air Force in a non-guaranteed student program.  The contractor will also collectdata supporting summative evaluation and document results in atest report.Air Force tasksThe Air Force will:Approve tryouts based on success criteria and checklists.Conduct tryouts in non-guaranteed student program.Support tryouts if contractor conducts.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2002137Section DMature System Performance ReviewIntroductionAfter the system has been operational and functional for a periodfor time, it will be continually evaluated.  At a certain point in itsoperation, however, a mature system performance review will beconducted.  It will be conducted on-site in a real environment,using full classes of real students.PurposeThe purpose of this review is to see if the system is performingas designed and expected and to identify any modificationsneeded.Contractor tasksThe contractor will conduct or support the review, depending onthe contract.  The contractor will also collect data supportingsummative evaluation, documenting any changes required andtest results.Air Force tasksThe using command will conduct or support operationalevaluation throughout the life cycle of the system.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002OverviewIntroductionChapter 9EVALUATIONEvaluation occurs throughout the ISD process.  Once instructionhas been conducted, the Air Force will be specifically concernedwith determining how well the training is achieving its objectives.Evaluation is the feedback that helps ensure that trainingobjectives are achieved and the quality of graduates’performance is acceptable.  The process continuously evaluatesthe course to determine if it is operating as designed.  Forexample, six months after students graduate, are they still able tomeet job performance requirements?  If not, why not?  Is itbecause of shortfalls in the course?  Should changes in thecourse be undertaken?  These are the kinds of questions youmust ask and reviews you must make to ensure that the trainingthat was developed is effective and efficient.  You have alreadybegun evaluation as you started with formative evaluation at thebeginning of planning with development of the evaluation plan.Now you must do more.PurposeThe purpose of this chapter is to describe the evaluation processthat is used to continually evaluate the effectiveness andefficiency of training.Where to readabout itThis chapter contains three sections.SectionTitleABCFormative EvaluationSummative EvaluationOperational EvaluationPage137138140AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2002139ISD phaseAs you can see in Figure 18, evaluation has the most emphasis.It is conducted throughout the ISD process, with each ISD phasebeing involved with evaluation.Figure 18 EvaluationAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Section AFormative EvaluationIntroductionEvaluation occurs throughout the ISD process, but formativeevaluation occurs during development, production, and testactivities.  It is the period from the beginning of planning tocourse readiness review or validation of materials.  Formativeevaluation should be part of the T&E plan, which was developedearlier.PurposeThe purpose of formative evaluation is to evaluate lesson/coursedevelopment during the "formative" stages and allow forcorrections (remedies) to be made before training is fullyimplemented.What is included?As part of the T&E plan, formative evaluation is conducted duringdevelopment, ITO, and SGTO.  It is not a process in itself, but aseries of events that are all part of formative evaluation.  Thedata collected is used to make lesson/course corrections and isprovided to the SPO for their review and action as necessary.Air Force tasksThe SPO reviews data and provides guidance as requested.AdditionalinformationFormative evaluation includes acceptance testing of equipmentand software, performance verification of system components,formative evaluation of courseware, and training systemdevelopment.The courseware formative evaluation plan is outlined in thesystem test plan.  The results of formative evaluation arereviewed in the CRR.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2002141Section BSummative EvaluationIntroductionSummative evaluation begins at the Courseware ReadinessReview (CRR), overlaps the formative evaluation phase, andterminates at the Training System Readiness Review (TSRR).PurposeSummative evaluation assesses the training system in theoperational environment to validate the baseline establishedearlier.  It will check for full system integration.The primary purpose of summative evaluation is to determinewhether the training developed for the students is effective andefficient.  It is the process of collecting data from students,instructors, and other key evaluation interfaces as they useinstructional media in the actual training environment.  Itspurpose is also to identify instructional materials, training mediaor instructional management system components that result inpoor learning, inefficiency, or poor student acceptance.  Thisdata will then drive improvements.Summative evaluation answers questions such as:How well has the training been accomplished as reflected byoperational requirements?Do graduates of a course meet established training systemand operational performance standards?Are the training system performance standards correct?How can the training be better accomplished?What is included?Summative evaluation is a form of quality improvement thatevaluates the "summed" effect of the total training program.  Itshould begin at CRR/validation and go through TSRR.  In theacquisition business, this is both internal and external.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Internal evaluationInternal evaluation determines the adequacy of each componentof the training program such as instruction, materials, equipment,and facilities.  It is conducted within the instructional system or"schoolhouse."  It determines how well each componentcontributes to the production of quality graduates.  Internalevaluation for a contractor-operated training system is usuallyconducted by the contractor and reviewed/approved by the SPOand/or using command.External evaluation External evaluation determines how well graduates are meetingjob performance requirements – the reason for training them inthe first place.  In external evaluation, the contractor will assessthe degree to which skills obtained during the course aregeneralized effectively to the operational unit environment.External evaluation utilizes information from the field, such asfeedback from supervisors of graduates.  The SPO and/or usingcommand will review/approve results of external evaluations.How to conductevaluationsInternal evaluations can be conducted by reviewing:Course documentsResourcesInstructional facilitiesInstructor performanceMeasurement programsExternal evaluations can be conducted by:QuestionnairesFor graduatesFor supervisorsField notesJob performance evaluationsAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2002143Section COperational EvaluationIntroductionOperational evaluation is the continuation of evaluationthroughout the life of the fully operational training system.Operational evaluation occurs on a system regardless of whetherit is contractor- or Air Force-operated.  The operationalevaluation is similar to summative evaluation except it iscontinuous and reflects long-term operational data.PurposeThe purpose of operational evaluation is to provide real-timedata for use in reviews, updates and quality improvement oftraining systems.  It is continuous improvement.Who conducts?The training source and the contract determine who conducts theoperational evaluation.  The best way to do this is to use thefollowing table.Thenoperationalevaluation isconducted by:ContractorAnd supportedby:UsingCommandsWith approvalevaluation by:SPOUSAFUsingCommandsSPOIf trainingsystem isoperated by:Contractor(TotalContractorTraining)USAF(Contractor-developed,USAF-operatedTurnkey)AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002What is included?Operational evaluation is a continuation of the procedures anddata collection begun in summative evaluation.  It usually startsat the TSRR and lasts throughout the life cycle of the program.The emphasis shifts from establishing the instructional value ofthe courses to detecting flaws or deterioration.  The prime goal isto maintain and improve course quality throughout the life cycle.The following issues should be addressed in operationalevaluation:Measurement and assessment of student learning incomparison to established training requirements andobjectivesMeasurement of terminal objectives (qualification/certification)Identification and resolution of discrepancies and deficienciesin coursewareAssessment of training in light of modification/upgrades in thedefense systemHow is itconducted?Operational evaluation is conducted by both internal and externalmeans.Internal evaluation can be conducted by reviewing:Course documentsResourcesInstructional facilitiesInstructor performanceMeasurement programsOther sources as necessaryExternal evaluations can be conducted by using:QuestionnairesFor graduatesFor supervisorsField visitsJob performance evaluationOther methods (i.e., SIMCERT Simulator certification)AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2002145AIR FORCE-DEVELOPED MAINTENANCE TRAININGChapter 10OverviewIntroductionDescriptionThis chapter is for the individual who has been charged withmanaging or being on a team responsible for applying ISD to AirForce-developed maintenance training concurrently with defensesystem acquisition.  This application would normally take placeduring the early acquisition cycles of a new defense system, butcould occur late in the cycle or even after the system has beenfielded.  Regardless of when your involvement begins, thischapter will help ensure that you do the right thing at the righttime.Maintenance training is performance- or knowledge-basedtraining for people who will maintain defense systems.  The termdefense system is all-encompassing.  A defense system is notlimited to aircraft, bombs, guns or missiles, but can includeanything needed to support the mission.  For example, radars,computers, trucks and engines can be considered part of thesesystems.Where to readabout itThis chapter contains two sections.  The first section explains themajor functions in applying ISD to Air Force-developedmaintenance training.  Section B provides an explanation of a15-step ISD process used in maintenance training.SectionTitleABMajor Functions in Applying ISD to AirForce- Developed MaintenanceTrainingISD Process Applied to MaintenanceTraining Acquisition EnvironmentPage143149Note: This chapter is primarily applicable to maintenancetraining.  However, it contains several management tools that canassist you in various ISD tasks, no matter what your involvementor function.  Use and adapt as you desire.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Section AMajor Functions in Applying ISD to Air Force-Developed Maintenance TrainingIntroductionThe major functions of applying ISD concurrently with acquisitionare general in nature and cover the normal management-typeareas.  This section has been written as if you are to be a teamchief or project manager of a portion of the ISD team.  Modify theguidance provided to best suit your needs.CriticalFactorsThere are many functions that determine the level of success.These include the following topics:PlanningSchedulingCollecting/reviewing dataBuilding work teamsTrainingManaging workloadsConducting meetingsTimelinessQualityPlanningPlanning for training development is one of the most importantactivities required for successful program management.  Properplanning requires you to make time on your calendar for thiscritical item.  Planning includes anything needed for successfulcompletion of the project.Make time on your calendar.Planning activitiesSome key planning activities are:SchedulingCollecting and reviewing dataAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2002147SchedulingScheduling is the process of defining what needs to be done andwhen it must be done to facilitate the smooth progression of workleading to project completion.  Several tools are available toassist you.  The ones you select will depend on your needs.Scheduling toolsSome scheduling tools include Gantt charts and PERT charts.Examples are shown in Figures 19 and 20, respectively.Gantt chartsGantt charts are an organizing tool to visually indicate resourcesand activities with a designated time frame.  They are used tocompare planned completion dates with actual performance.These charts consist of a list of tasks to be accomplished and thetime allowed for each.  Some tasks are sequential and some areoverlapping.  A Gantt chart contains:Horizontal time scale that depicts the length of the projectVertical axis with list of all activities involved in the projectHorizontal bar indicating duration of each activityExampleFigure 19 Example Gantt ChartTask Duration (months)123456789101112Activity Description1.

Hardware Delivery1079Collecting andanalyzing dataCollecting and analyzing data occurs during the life of theacquisition, beginning at concept exploration.  Data can beanything from blueprints to performance characteristics tovarious training reports.  The SPO Program Manager (PM),through the Data Maintenance Office (DMO), is responsible foracquiring the contractor data necessary to manage all aspects ofthe program.  The data collection and analysis process isdepicted in Figure 21.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2002149Collecting andanalyzing data(Continued)Figure 21 Data Collection and Analysis ProcessDMO issuesData CallSent to functional offices in SPO andall participating commands and agenciesFunctional ManagersIdentify DataUsing DIDsData Item Description (DID) may be tailoredto eliminate unnecessary requirementsDMO CompilesAll RequirementsPM conducts DataRequirements ReviewBoard (DRRB)DMO Finalizes ContractData RequirementsList (CDRL)CDRL to PMfor Inclusion inContractEliminate unnecessary requirements (with coordinationServes as final review of datarequirements justificationFinal checkContracting office includes CDRL in contractData DeliveredPer ContractAs contract performance proceeds, data is delivered IcontractReview and AnalysisAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Data ProcessData examplesSome examples of data include:Building workteamsTrainingProgram schedulesTraining and Training Equipment Plan (TTEP)Training support dataCourse critiquesISD management planNote: Do not request or accept data unless you have a validneed.  Data is expensive, more so when it is unnecessary.  SeeDiscussion on MIL-HDBK-29612 on Page 52.Once you have developed a schedule and begun to collect andanalyze data, you will have a better understanding of the type ofstaff members you will need to pull onto your team.  Do this verycarefully.  Success depends on teamwork and dedication to theproject.  There are limitless numbers of books on team buildingand leadership secrets to success; but there are no short cuts.Check the books, review your leadership and managementcourse materials, and talk to your network of trusted bosses andformer bosses, as well as successful peers.  Learn from them.Team members may come from unit resources or from TDYlocations.Never assume that your team knows all there is to know.  If theyhave worked on ISD projects before, and have been successful,then you can assume that they know what needs to be done.What you must do is set the work and training standards up front.Explain the project to the team and establish your rules of order.Survey the team and develop appropriate training.  It may besomething as simple as telephone etiquette to something ascomplex as preparing a wiring diagram of electrical componentsin a widget.  The goal of ISD is to produce training and increaseskills and knowledge, but you should do it for your team first andnot neglect your own training.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2002151ManagingworkloadsConductingmeetingsTimelinessIf you’ve been a manager for any length of time, you have heardthat the best way to manage workloads is to "delegate."  Butdelegation alone does not foster success.  You must know whatand to whom to delegate.  You must follow up, and know when tofollow up.  No one ever admits to having extra personnel thatthey want to give you to help out.  So you must use your staff tomanage as necessary.  Use the computer or manual systems fortracking."Everyone hates meetings."  Not true!  Everyone hates non-productive, worthless meetings.  Make sure yours are productive.Don’t have a meeting for the sake of a meeting.  Have anagenda, stick to it, take notes, publish minutes and follow up.Expect the same of your staff.  Meetings are for communication,but they also keep the team informed and on the right track."The early bird gets the worm."  Maybe, but earlier you built aschedule.  If you built it right, stick to it and deliver as promised.If there is a legitimate reason for slippage in the schedule, informyour superiors.  They would rather have an honest person whowants to build and deliver a quality product with a schedule delaythan an inferior product on time.Quality"If you don’t have time to do it right the first time, when will youhave time to fix it?"  Quality and timeliness go hand-in-hand andcannot be overemphasized.  Your team should focus on qualityand continuous improvement.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Section BISD Process Applied toMaintenance Training Acquisition EnvironmentIntroductionIf you read AFMAN 36-2234, you learned that the original ISDmodel was considered to be a five-step process, even though the"steps" were not intended to be followed in a typical "step-by-step" process but in phases.  The revised model has phases thatshould be done in a continuous process, not step-by-step.  Youlearned earlier that ISD is a never-ending process.  You will learnthrough practical experience that in your particular operation orprogram, modification of the phases may facilitate application ofISD.  If this helps ensure a quality product that meets the user’straining objectives, then do it.The following example is a synopsis of a 15-step ISD processprovided for your information and use as appropriate.  This 15-step process was designed to fit the peculiarities and limitationsof the AF-developed maintenance training acquisitionenvironment.  It is taken from the procedures used by the 374Training Development Squadron (TDS) of Air Education andTraining Command (AETC) as they apply ISD to new orsignificantly modified defense systems.  The ISD phases with the15-step process are listed below.  Note:  This is only anexample of one organization’s application of ISD.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2002153Introduction(Continued)Air ForceISD PhasesStep374 Training DevelopmentSquadron ISD ProcessAnalysisDesignDevelopmentImplementation123456789101112131415Identify System RequirementsIdentify Characteristics of the TargetAudienceDetermine Task-Based  TrainingRequirementsDetermine Concept-Based TrainingRequirementsDetermine Media and MethodologyDevelop Instructional StrategiesIdentify Hardware FidelityRequirementsIdentify Interactive CoursewareFidelity RequirementsIdentify Instructional FeaturesPrepare Training EquipmentFunctional SpecificationPrepare Course Control DocumentsPrepare Instructional Materials andTestsValidate InstructionConduct TrainingEvaluate TrainingApplicationsThe maintenance training system (or portions) for most major AirForce defense systems has been developed using theseprocedures.  Examples include:B-1BB-2C-17Joint STARSAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Other usesBackgroundBy modifying the 15-step process (deleting or changing steps),these procedures have been successfully applied to operatortraining, ISD training, additional duty training, TQM training andothers.  Use and modify as appropriate for your project.Note: This section is a synopsis only.  The 15-step process isexplained in further detail in Attachment E.As you learned earlier, the acquisition ISD process actuallybegins when HQ USAF issues a PMD to the major commands.This document directs the SPO to begin system acquisition.  TheSPO then develops a PMP, which outlines responsibilities andgeneral management objectives.  HQ AETC provides inputs toSection II, Training, of the PMP.  Part of AETC’s responsibility, insupport of a new defense system, is test participation.  TheDirector of Technical Training Operations makes the assignmentof a Responsible Agency (RA), HQ AETC/TTO (example, the 374TDS was the RA for the B-1 program).374 TDSparticipation planThe 374 TDS, Plans and Evaluation branch, submits a proposedParticipation Plan (PP) to HQ AETC/TTO. The PP shows how the374 TDS proposes to manage ISD and test activities.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2002155374 TDSparticipation plan(Continued)ISD teamorganizationSectionDescription123Section 1 of the PP outlines objectives,background, related documents, schedules, andresources required for planning purposes.After coordination with prime and associatecenters, HQ AETC approves the PP and forwardsSection 2 (ISD Objectives, Methodology,Schedules, and Resource Requirements) to theprime training center for inclusion in the TrainingParticipation Plan (TPP) as the ISD Annex.Section 3 [Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E)Objectives, Methodology, Schedules, and ResourceRequirements] is forwarded to either the Air ForceOperational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC)or the Responsible Test Organization (RTO).  HQAETC then approves required personnelauthorizations (identified in the PP) for the 374TDS. Personnel for these authorizations may bedrawn from the prime center, using command, orothers as directed by the Field Training Group(FLDTG).The 374 TDS begins the ISD effort by organizing an ISD team.Whenever possible, a senior NCO experienced in squadron andtest management procedures is assigned as Acquisition TrainingDevelopment Manager (ATDM).  The ATDM leads the ISD team.This person is responsible for meeting the objectives outlined inthe PP. The ATDM also ensures that the ISD team is trained inthe 15-step ISD process for acquisition and is familiar withAFMAN 36-2234, AFH 36-2235, and AFI 36-2201.  Whentrained, the ISD team begins compiling data on systemmaintenance requirements. Once the data are collected, the ISDteam begins the analysis.TRRRMTRRRMparticipantsTRRRMresultsPurposeAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002The results of the ISD analysis [training and Technical TrainingMaterial (TTM) requirements] are then reviewed by participatingagencies in a Training Requirements Recommendation ReviewMeeting (TRRRM).  The TRRRM is designed to review, consoli-date, and coordinate AETC TTM recommendations. It is alsoused to review proposed Course Control Documents (CCDs)prior to further action.Participants in the TRRRM, other than 374 TDS, may include theHQ AETC Training Staff Officer (TSO), HQ AETC TrainingEquipment Resources Manager, Field Training Group, TrainingSupport Squadron, prime center Plans and Resourcespersonnel, and associate center Plans and Resourcespersonnel.The result of the TRRRM is a consolidated package ofrecommended TTM/CCDs. The package is reviewed by theProgram Office (PO) (for funding and procurement action), whodevelops system specifications for each hardware trainingdevice.  Specifications are then reviewed by HQ AETC andplaced on contract by the PO.The purpose of allowing AETC personnel to review thesespecifications (before contracting) is to ensure that the TTMsatisfies objectives identified during analysis.  Subject matterspecialists (SMS) may also participate in design reviews toensure that required characteristics, as well as changes, areincorporated.  Changes for training hardware after the TRRRMmay require modification to the contract.  Transition of SMSs tothe first training site is scheduled to support operationalrequirements. SMSs become the nucleus of the initial instructorcadre. Procured TTM is delivered, installed, and operationallychecked at the training site by contractors.  When all resourcesare in place, the final ISD step can begin.  By actively seekingsystem information during the early phases of System Acquisi-tion/Test and Evaluation and applying ISD, AETC can providethe PO with appropriate TTM requirements.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2002157Synopsis of15-step processThe following is a synopsis of the 15-step ISD process.StepTitleDescription12345678Identify SystemRequirementsIdentifyCharacteristicsof the TargetPopulationDetermineTask-BasedTrainingRequirementsDetermineConcept-BasedTrainingRequirementsDetermineMedia andMethodologyDevelopInstructionalStrategiesIdentifyHardwareFidelityRequirementsIdentify ICWFidelityRequirementsDuring this step, references areresearched and data gatheredconcerning a given Air Force SpecialtyCode (AFSC); specifically, the dutiesand tasks performed in an AFSC.This step is used to analyze previouslylearned skills and knowledge todetermine a target populationdefinition.What students can already do (Step 2)is subtracted from what they must do(Step 1).

As aresult, efficient and effective maintenance was not available.(Source:  AFSC/HSD.)Operational E-3As were used as trainers because no trainerswere initially purchased with the weapon system.  In addition,built-in test (BIT) was eliminated without evaluating its impacton training.  These two decisions resulted in costly correctiveactions.  In the interim, the Air Force paid $3 million a year forcontract training.  Had they bought the trainer on time theycould have saved $9 million.  (Source:  Tech Report ADB099-970.

They had 100%serviceable spares, no holes, and plenty of combat-readyAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001215Examples(Continued)spare modules.  Activating -220-equipped F-15 aircraft in July1986, the 33rd TFW received their 59th aircraft in May 1988.Throughout the 36,000-plus hours flown since that time,reliability and maintainability parameters remained atunprecedented high levels.  The engine operated so well thatmaintaining skill proficiency levels became a problem similarto the "Maytag repairman" story.  Since the engine seldombroke, there was little chance to work on it.  Much of thissuccess story was attributed to the overall strategy of stronguser involvement during ASD field visits to finalize thetechnical data requirements and maintenance concept tostarting production engine deliveries.

Each AFSC is considered tobe a job.  Each job is completed by performing related duties;each duty is completed by performing a given number of tasks;each task is completed by performing a sequence of activities;and each activity is completed by applying skill and knowledgebehaviors.  By approaching acquisition training development inthis manner and using the right analysis parameters, accurateand cost-effective training/TTM can be determined.  Also notethat results of analysis performed using this handbook may bedocumented by either completing forms you develop or usingforms developed by the 374 TDS and provided at the end of thisattachment.  While these forms are not mandatory, they areprovided because they have been successfully used for theseprocedures.  You may also document data by using the ISDAutomation software (IBM-compatible) titled "ISDA" availablefrom the 374 TDS (for address, see page 259).WARNINGIf working with classified data, the media used todocument the data become classified.  Always checkwith the Program Security Officer for instructionsconcerning storage and disposition of media.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001217STEP 1IDENTIFY SYSTEM REQUIREMENTSSubstep 1Identify DutiesPurposeExampleThe purpose of this substep is to identify and compile a list ofduty statements associated with an AFSC as related to theweapon system. A list of duty statements can be assembled byreferring to the “Specialty Summary” and “Duties andResponsibilities” sections of AFR 39-1, Occupational SurveyReports (OSRs), applicable specialty training standards, andcontractor data.  Duty statements are created from two parts ofspeech, a verb and an object.  The verb and the object describethe duty in a broad sense.For example, one of the duties of an avionics technician might beto “Maintain the J-4 Compass System.”  In this example, the verband the object don’t tell how (remove, replace) or what (fluxvalve, main amplifier) to maintain.  Together they simply telltechnicians that they are required to keep an aircraft system inworking order.  Don’t hesitate to assume that some duties are re-quired even if they’re not stated in available data sources. Useyour experience as well as the experience of other SMSs.However, be sure to document all assumptions as such.  Youmay document your data in any format you desire; just documentit.VerificationOnce the list of duty statements is complete, have it verified byapplicable agencies such as the using command and test forcetechnicians.  After verification, a periodic review/reevaluationshould be accomplished to ensure accuracy.  As the systemmatures, new information becomes available.Substep 2Gather DataPurposeLimit yourdatabaseAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002The purpose of this substep is to gather all data pertaining to agiven AFSC which, in turn, is related to a given weapon system.This data will eventually be used to help structure a completetask list.  The complete task list is used to identify and definepotential training requirements.The database should be limited to data relating to entriesidentified in the duties list (developed in the first substep).  Forexample, while performing ISD for an avionics system of anaircraft, data related to the engine isn’t considered unless thesesystems interact with one another.Additional sources Many “new” or “advanced” systems are actually the nextgeneration of existing equipment. Similarities may exist in opera-tor/maintenance functions and performance requirements. Dataobtained from similar systems can be used to project new jobperformance requirements.ExamplesData can be collected from:User-defined operational conceptsUser-defined maintenance conceptsPDRsCDRsLSAMaintenance Level Analysis (MLA)Contractor engineering drawingsSMS/contractor engineer interviewsSMS/contractor technician interviewsDevelopmental Program Manuals (DPMs)Preliminary Technical Orders (PTOs)Forms of dataData can take many forms. Use any and all available data tocompile as comprehensive a database as possible.Substep 3Identify TasksAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001219PurposeThe purpose of this substep is to identify and record a compre-hensive list of task statements necessary to perform all relatedduties. A good task description will include a definition of what isto be done, why, when, where, by whom, and how well.  Theentire training scenario is built upon written task descriptions,which detail job performance requirements.  Use the followingcriteria to identify tasks.A task is a group of related activities directed toward a goal.A task usually has a definite beginning and end.A task involves a person’s interaction with equipment, otherpersonnel, and/or media.A task, when performed, results in a meaningful product.A task includes a mixture of decisions, perceptions, and/ormotor activities.A task may be any size or degree of complexity, but must bedirected toward a specific purpose or discrete portion of thetotal duty.ExampleIdentify the tasks for every duty statement from Substep 1.Referring to the example in Substep 1, the first task statementmight be “REMOVE J-4 COMPASS SYSTEM FLUX VALVE.” Theverb and object describe, more specifically, how and what tomaintain.Substep 4Verify Task ListPurposeThe purpose of this substep is to verify that the task list is ascomplete and accurate as possible. Verification requires closecoordination between applicable agencies. These agenciesmight include other SMSs, test force counterparts, contractorpersonnel, or user maintenance personnel.VerificationinstructionsAlso, when asking for task list verification, give instructions to:Identify additional tasks that need to be included.Identify tasks not performed on this weapon system, but puton the list in error.Evaluate each statement’s action verb for accuracy.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002ModificationsOnce the task list is verified, make the necessary modifications.As with the duty list, reevaluate the task list.Substep 5Group TasksPurposeThe purpose of this substep is to group discrete/related tasks.Keep in mind that the way tasks are grouped may influence thedesign of the training equipment. Tasks that are groupedtogether tend to be taught together.Logical groupingA logical procedure for grouping tasks is to separate them bymajor subsystem. Tasks related to individual subsystems may befurther divided according to functions performed. Finally, tasksmay be subgrouped at the line/shop level within each function.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001221IDENTIFY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TARGET POPULATIONSTEP 2IntroductionDefinitionBefore training requirements can be determined, two pieces ofinformation are needed: (1) tasks identified in Step 1, and (2)characteristics of the target population. These characteristics areskills and knowledge that the target population already possessand are combined to create a definition of the target population.The target population is defined based on two factors: (1) skilllevels, and (2) previous training. Skill levels are simply the 3, 5,or 7 level rating of the personnel who will perform themaintenance.  Previous training refers to technical training andother formal education.  These factors are important becausethey influence the number of potential training requirements thatare analyzed and trained.  Use sources such asCourse/Specialty Training Standards, Occupational Surveys,personal experience, etc., to build on this information.DocumentassumptionSometimes it’s necessary to make assumptions about the targetpopulation. If this has to be done, base assumptions on the mostcurrent information from applicable sources.Target populationdefinition summaryA summation of this analysis is called a Target PopulationDefinition. This definition becomes the baseline for the remaininganalysis.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002DETERMINE TASK-BASED TRAINING REQUIREMENTSSTEP 3IntroductionIn this step, an analyst decides what is and what isn’t included inthe training. This decision is made by comparing trainingrequirements (Step 1) with the characteristics of the targetpopulation (Step 2).Substep 1Identify ActivitiesPurposeDefinitionActivities analysisThe purpose of this substep is to document the sequence ofactivities used to complete each task; each activity is thenanalyzed to see if it can be classified as a potential trainingrequirement.An activity can be considered a discrete step toward thecompletion of a given task. Use any and all available data suchas Technical Orders (TOs), personal experience, interviews withtest personnel, etc., to build a list of activity statements.  Eachactivity must, as a minimum, describe (1) the action taken, (2) theobject of the action, (3) the equipment/tools used to perform theaction, (4) precautions and likely errors, (5) any alternativeactivities, and (6) any existing contingencies.Each activity of every task is analyzed by answering fivequestions.  Only those activities identified as potential trainingrequirements need to be analyzed for related skill and knowledgebehaviors.  To analyze activities, answer the following:Is the activity new? That is, has this exact step in this system,subsystem, or piece of equipment not been performed by thetarget population before?Are there any abnormal conditions associated with performingthe activity? Are there environmental limitations under whichthe activity must be performed, such as extreme noise orContinued on next pageAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001223Activities analysis(Continued)limited access? Is the equipment or material being handledhazardous, heavy, or bulky? Is more than one personrequired to manipulate switches?Are there new or unusual criteria related to the activity? Doesthe activity require new or stricter standards of performancefor speed, timing, accuracy, or sequence?Is there a chance for negative transfer to occur? If the targetpopulation performs this activity in a manner previouslylearned, will it cause incorrect or dangerous results?Are any new or modified support tools or equipment required?If noIf yesIf the answer to all of these questions is "NO," the activity issimply integrated into the training scenario for the benefit ofcohesion.  That is, it doesn’t drive a training requirement but it’sstill needed to complete the task.If the answer to any of these questions is "YES," the activity isconsidered to be a potential training requirement.Substep 2Identify Skill and Knowledge BehaviorsIntroductionDefinitionSkill and knowledge behaviors form the foundation of thetraining. They influence the characteristics and type of trainingequipment as well as the structure of the instructional content.A skill behavior is any discrete physical action that requirespractice to master. Some examples are lifting or movingequipment, positioning components, and tightening or looseninghardware.  A knowledge behavior is a fact, rule, or principle; it’s apiece of information retained and results in observable behaviorduring the performance of a task.IdentificationEach of these types of behavior needs to be identified beforeapplying any analysis parameters. Use the following taxonomy tohelp identify activities.  These points clarify skill and knowledgebehaviors related to an activity.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Identification(Continued)Skill and Knowledge TaxonomyASOASSOCIATING; naming; responding to a specific input.The student associates the response with a specificinput only.

For example, beingable to locate an object isn’t the same as being able to name anobject. That is, it isn’t necessary to associate a name to an objectin order to find it. The difference, although small, influences thetype of learning (taxonomy) and therefore the type of trainingthat’s developed.ExamplesHow to identifypotentialrequirementsThe example of "APPLY AIRCRAFT POWER" contains severalbehaviors.  A technician would first need to find the power cablebefore connecting it to the aircraft.  Therefore, the first behavioris knowledge-based and might be written as "IDENTIFY POWERCABLE."  Phrase knowledge behaviors carefully; list anyinformation that might help, form an objective such asperformance conditions or criteria.Now that skill and knowledge behaviors are identified, begin theanalysis that determines which are potential trainingrequirements.  Each skill/knowledge behavior of every activity(identified as a potential training requirement) is analyzed byanswering several questions.  Only those skill and knowledgebehaviors identified as potential training requirements need to beanalyzed for equipment requirements.Is the skill/knowledge new to the target population?Is there an unusual condition attached to the skill/knowledge?For example, is there an awkward body movement necessaryin performance, limited or "blind" access/visibility, etc.?Are there new or unusual criteria related to the activity? Doesthe activity require new or stricter standards of performancefor speed, timing, accuracy, or sequence?Is there a chance for negative transfer to occur? If the targetpopulation performs this activity in a manner previouslylearned, will it cause incorrect or dangerous results?Are any new or modified support tools or equipment required?If NoIf the answer to all of these questions is "NO," the skill orknowledge behavior is integrated into the training scenario forthe benefit of cohesion. It doesn’t drive a training requirement butit’s still needed to complete the activity.If YesAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002If the answer to any of these questions is "YES," the skill orknowledge behavior is considered to be a potential trainingrequirement.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001229DETERMINE CONCEPT-BASED TRAINING REQUIREMENTSSTEP 4IntroductionExampleCognitive trainingIn this step, skill and knowledge behaviors identified as potentialtraining requirements are analyzed further for potential concepttraining requirements. That is, some of those pieces ofknowledge that indirectly support potential training requirements(behaviors) may not be known to the target population.A jet engine mechanic has to perform engine changes from timeto time. Part of being able to do this is knowing (cognitivedomain) where the mount bolts are located and how to removethem.  Note: These are the types of behaviors identified andanalyzed in Step 3.  But, there’s another knowledge componenthere; mount bolts are required to be “close tolerance.”  They fittighter and, therefore, create a more reliable structure.  Does ajet engine mechanic have to know this to change an engine?  Itdepends on the definition of the target population. This is “nice toknow” information for someone who does nothing more thanengine changes, but consider the same information within adifferent scenario.  A jet engine mechanic is assigned totroubleshoot an engine vibration problem.  The problem isn’tsevere enough to warrant an engine change, but it’s noticeable.The vibration of the engine is induced into the airframe; why?“Close tolerance” mount bolts form a single structure of theengine and the airframe. Vibrations propagate through a solidmass more readily than through a looser structure.  The word“troubleshoot” adds a new dimension to the task.The analysis performed in this step also supports potentialtraining requirements that fall exclusively into the cognitiverealm; for example, training scenarios that present a degree ofunderstanding for system theory or management practices.These types of scenarios are on the same level with performance(psychomotor)-based tasks and are assembled or disassembledin the same way; they are referred to here as cognitive-basedtraining requirements.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002What is a concept? In both contexts, a concept is an idea or group of ideas withcommon elements. From this perspective, a concept can bethought of as a set of common elements, each element having itsown characteristics.Substep 1Identify ConceptsPurposeHow to identifyconceptsThe purpose of this substep is to identify concepts that arerelevant not only to those behaviors identified as potentialtraining requirements, but also to those tasks that fall exclusivelyinto the cognitive realm (potential cognitive-based trainingrequirements).First, identify concepts that are relevant to potential behavioraltraining requirements.  Next, identify those tasks (potentialcognitive-based training requirements) that are exclusively withinthe cognitive realm.  Apply the following six questions to eachpotential cognitive-based training requirement. If the answer toany of these questions is “YES,” then it’s considered a potentialconcept-training requirement and is analyzed in the remainingsubsets.Does the target population need to know about functionaloperations of components?Does the target population need to know about associatedsystem inputs (input signals or data from another system)?Does the target population need to know uses, capabilities,and limitations of test equipment?Does the target population need to understand and be able toapply knowledge of signal flow to find discrete components?Does the target population need to use other data with testequipment to find faulty components?Does the target population need to know and apply specificrules such as Ohm’s Law?Substep 2Identify Concept ElementsAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001231DefinitionExampleConcepts are made of elements, much the same way that tasksare made of activities.  Disassembling each concept into discreteknowledge parts (elements) identifies these elements.The concept of troubleshooting contains many elements.  Threeof these elements are: (1) identify the problem, (2) localize theproblem to a subassembly or function, and (3) isolate theproblem to the discrete component.  The requirement to performtroubleshooting may have been identified in Step 3, but theconcept or theory (collective concept elements) is identified here.How to identifyconcept elementsAnalyze each element and apply the following questions.Is the element relevant to the target population? An elementis relevant when it has a direct bearing on the subject matter,so closely related to the concept as to provide reinforcement,or is required for understanding and reinforcement.Is the element incidental to the target population?  Theseelements are similar to those activities and behaviors thatweren’t identified as potential training requirements but wereincluded for the sake of cohesion.If the answer to both of these questions is “NO,” the element isdiscarded.If the answer to the first question is “YES,” the element isidentified as a potential concept element-training requirement.These are the only elements considered for further analysis.  Ifthe answer to the second question is “YES,” it isn’t consideredfor further analysis, but is included in the training scenario for thebenefit of cohesion.If noIf yesSubstep 3Identify Characteristics of ElementsAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002IntroductionExampleCharacteristics make an element unique. Referring to theprevious example, the concept of troubleshooting, each elementimplies progress toward a goal. It’s because of the uniquecharacteristics of each element that a technician can reach thatgoal.To identify a problem in an avionics system, technicians mustuse several of the physical senses (that’s one characteristic) andbe able to understand the sequential signal flow from onecomponent to another (that’s another characteristic). Techniciansmust also understand the functional operation of eachcomponent (characteristic) as well as each component’sinterrelationship with others (yet another characteristic).How to identifycharacteristicsRemember, characteristics are identified only for potentialconcept element training requirements that are “RELEVANT.”Ask these questions:Is the characteristic new? Has this target population beenexposed to this level of understanding on this system?Is the characteristic complex? That is, is it detailed, does itrequire a higher level of scientific theory, or understanding ofmathematical formulas?Is the characteristic critical? Can the element be understoodwithout it?If the answer to all of these questions is “NO,” the characteristiccan be discarded.If the answer to any of these questions is “YES,” it’s identified asa potential element characteristic training requirement anddocumented.If noIf yesAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001233DETERMINE MEDIA AND METHODOLOGYSTEP 5IntroductionIf there’s a training requirement, something must be used toteach it some form of media. The first image that comes to mindis an instructor standing in front of a class lecturing fromtransparencies. This is the most common way to get a pointacross, but not always the most effective. Instructional scenariosshould stimulate the senses.In this step, the analyst is prompted by a series of questions.Answers given in response to these questions determine the bestdelivery method, domain of learning, whether hardware oralternate media is used, the appropriate media class, and thebest method of instruction for each media class.Substep 1Determine Method of DeliveryPurposeThe purpose of this substep is to determine how the instructionalmessage is delivered.How to deliverinstructionThere are two ways to deliver the instructional message, (1) byan instructor or instructor-based delivery, and (2) by specificmedia or media-based delivery.Instructor-baseddeliveryInstructor-based delivery may use a variety of media such astransparencies, exhibits, etc., but without the instructor the mediais lifeless. That is, the media can’t deliver the instructionalmessage by itself; media only supports delivery of theinstructional message.Media-baseddeliveryIn media-based delivery, an instructor isn’t necessary forlearning to take place. The media is a self-contained instructionalunit; it provides (in most cases) stimulus and feedback, and aninstructor supports delivery of the instructional message.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002How to determinemethod of deliveryTo determine the method of delivery for behaviors and concepts,ask the following questions:Is the instructional content dynamic? If the content is likelyto change, requiring updates more than once a year, it’sconsidered to be dynamic.  The cost of updating media-based materials is very high compared to updatingalternate media.Does the behavior deal with interpersonal skills, behaviormodification, or change in attitude? This focuses on theaffective domain of learning. Human interaction isgenerally more effective in a classroom or laboratoryenvironment.Is team effort or interaction with an instructor important?Where team efforts are concerned, it’s usually desirable tolet an instructor control the learning environment.Does the behavior require feedback on performance ofmotor skills or procedures? When students work to mastera psychomotor skill they require feedback to correctundesirable behavior.Is the instructional message intended for widedistribution? Consider the target population and wherethey’ll be located.  If the target population is scatteredthroughout a geographical location, then the instructionalmessage needs to be exported.  The cost of sendinginstructors may be prohibitive; therefore, hardware(media-based instruction) may be appropriate.Is it critical that the content be delivered the same wayevery time? While it’s certainly desirable, it’s seldomcritical. This is intended to identify those behaviors whereinconsistent or faulty instruction could lead to unsafe actson the part of the target population.Should the instructional content be adaptable to individualdifferences and/or allow individuals to control the pace oramount of practice? In situations where extremes exist inindividual capabilities, learning styles, or previous training/experience, media-based material may be appropriate.Is face-to-face instruction impractical? Consider theavailability of qualified instructors, instructor-to-studentratios, and temporary duty (TDY) costs. If any of thesefactors apply, media-based material is appropriate.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001235How to determinemethod of delivery(Continued)Note: Each skill/knowledge behavior and concept trainingrequirement is analyzed using these same eight questions.Notice, also, that the first four questions are considerationsfor instructor-based delivery and the last four questionsare considerations for media-based delivery.  Use Yes/Noanswers to these questions to determine your mediarecommendationsSubstep 2Determine Domain of LearningIntroductionThe domain of learning is another key factor that helps determinewhether to use hardware or alternate media.  In this substep, thedomain of learning is determined for both delivery methods,instructor-based and media-based.How to determinedomain of learningTo determine the domain of learning for instructor- or media-based delivery, each behavior and concept is analyzed usingthese questions.  If the answer to any one question is “YES,” ananalyst is directed to the appropriate domain of learning.Document the results.Is the behavior a motor skill? If so, it is a psychomotor domainof learning. A motor skill is a matter of dexterity, that is, agiven body movement or motion that’s practiced so much thatit becomes automatic.  For example, tightening a bolt with anadjustable wrench is a motor skill that some 3-skill-leveltechnicians must practice. Practice is required for them tolearn how to use the wrench with one hand and adjust itwithout dropping it.Does the behavior call for knowledge or mental skills? If so, itis a cognitive domain of learning. Task knowledge are factsand principles that support performance.  Mental skills allow aperson to make decisions, discriminate between similarinputs, or to recognize the difference betweenobjects/concepts.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002How to determinedomain of learning(Continued)Does the behavior require a change in attitude? If so, it is anaffective domain of learning. Attitudes refer to an internalstate that influences the choices a person makes.  Thisconsists of emotional and intellectual aspects.  The point offocus here is those attitudes that can be changed withexposure to role models, opportunities for successfulaccomplishment, and positive reinforcement.ConclusionsTo this point, the delivery method and domain of learning areknown for each behavior and concept.  The 374 TDSrecommends analyzing training requirements identified forinstructor-based delivery first.Substep 3Determine Instructor-Based Delivery RequirementsAre motor skillsrequired?If motor skills (psychomotor domain) are required in learning,analyze the behavior or concept by answering the followingquestions:Is the behavior difficult to execute? If the behavior is difficultto execute, it’s probably difficult to master without somehands-on practice. For example, adjusting the color bias on atelevision or adjusting a carburetor on a running engine.Are there unusual conditions? Consider the workingenvironment and stressful situations such as working incramped quarters or where pacing of events can’t becontrolled.Are there special performance criteria? Criteria are standardsof performance. Are there specifications that can’t be metwithout practice?Are there hardware cues that affect performance? The actualequipment may provide feedback that’s too difficult orcomplex to explain. Simulation of equipment feedback may beshown with audiovisual media or hardware. Which is mostcost-effective?Are new support tools/equipment required? Note: “Tools” arenot only wrenches and hammers but also mathematicalequations, computer programs, formulas, etc. However, theconcern here is hardware-type tools. Other tools should beanalyzed as alternate media.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001237Are motor skillsrequired?(Continued)Are the consequences of error high? This focuses onchances of personal injury or damage to equipment if thebehavior isn’t performed correctly. An aircraft egress system,for example, isn’t taught on actual equipment for 3-skill-leveltraining; one mistake is enough to kill a person and damageequipment.Is the frequency of performance very high or very low?  Somebehaviors are performed so often that practice on a hardwaretraining device leads to greater efficiency. On the other hand,behaviors (such as emergency procedures) may beperformed so rarely that they’re forgotten unless practicedoften.If yesIf noIf the answer to any of these questions is “YES,” the analyst isdirected to use a hardware (HW) training device.For “NO” responses, hardware isn’t used, so alternate media isthe appropriate choice. Consider the relevant factors used asstimuli. These factors influence student performance.Alternate mediaMedia includes, but is not limited to:PrintAudioProjected still visualAudio projected still visualMotion visualAudio motion visualColor motion visualColor audio motion visualHow to determinealternate mediaTo determine the appropriate alternate media for a behavior orconcept (psychomotor domain), answer the following questions:Is display of motion necessary? In some cases, students mayhave to respond to feedback from system components; thereverse may also be true.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002How to determinealternate media(Continued)Is color necessary? Unless color flags an important aspect ofsystem operation (warning lights, for example) or is present ina real scenario, it isn’t necessary.Is sound necessary? Again, consider whether or not thisfactor flags an important aspect of system operation or ispresent in the real scenario.Note: All other behaviors and concepts are understood torequire hardware.  These are analyzed at a later time.Are knowledgeskills required?If knowledge skills are required, you must analyze the behavioror concept.  Ask the following questions:Does the behavior involve unfamiliar concepts or objects?Consider whether or not the target population was everexposed to this specific behavior.  This includes equipmentas well as environment.Does the behavior involve interpersonal skills?  Consider anyinteraction/communication between people.Is display of motion necessary?  Again, students may have torespond to feedback from system components.Is sound necessary? If it flags important aspects of systemoperation or is present in a real scenario, the answer is“YES.”Is it practical to demonstrate the real thing in class?  Forexample, it isn’t practical to bring a complete jet engine intoclass to teach the knowledge portion of removing mount bolts.Remember that this is the cognitive domain.By answering these five questions, the analyst is led to theappropriate alternate media.Substep 4Determine Media-Based Delivery RequirementsSynopsisAn analyst may have determined earlier that a given behavior issuited to media-based delivery.  That is, the training scenario iscontrolled by some type of media that provides stimuli, monitorsstudent response, and provides feedback.  Now you need todetermine delivery requirements for all three domains of learningsupported by media-based delivery.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001239Substep 5Determine Method of InstructionIntroductionThe purpose of this substep is to determine the best method ofinstruction for each media class (within alternate media)identified earlier.How todeterminemethod ofinstructionThe best way to determine method of instruction is to use amatrix of media/method (see Figure E-1).  To use this matrix,match the method of instruction with the best media for thetraining.Figure E-1 Media/Method MatrixMETHOD______________________________Student PerformanceDemonstrationGuided DiscussionTraditional LectureSelf-Paced/Prog InstructionMEDIA________________________________Print (PRT)Audio (AUD)Projected Still Visual (PSV)Audio Projected Still Visual (APSV)Motion Visual (MV)Color Motion Visual (CMV)Color Audio Motion Visual (CAMV)Exhibit (EXH)Still Visual (SVS)Interactive Courseware (ICW))Hardware (HDW)Y = Yes  N = No M = MaybeYMYYYYYYMYMYYYYYYYNYNNMNMMMMMNNNNNNMYYYYYYMMYNNMMMMMMNMYAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002DEVELOP INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIESSTEP 6IntroductionThis step is designed to refocus efforts at the task level.  Theend product is a preliminary overview of the training scenario.Substep 1Develop Criterion ObjectivesDefinitionDescriptionWhen phrased properly, criterion objectives specify under whatcircumstances a behavior is performed (condition), exactly whatmust be done (behavior), and how well the behavior is performed(standard).The condition describes the important aspects of theperformance environment. Examples of these aspects are thetools the students are given to work with, access to technicaldata, and special instructions.The behavior of a criterion objective is observable andmeasurable. That is, students must demonstrate a knowledge orperformance so that an instructor can determine/see a specifieddegree of skill or change. The behavior also matches, as closelyas possible, actual task performance.The standard of a criterion objective specifies the precise degreeof completeness and accuracy of a behavior. The degree ofcompleteness and accuracy may be stated as compliance withTos, minimum levels of acceptable performance, timerequirements, rate of production, etc.Potential trainingCriterion objectives are developed only from those tasks andconcepts identified as potential training requirements. Considereach one carefully; some may not be observable or measurable.Instructional goalsTraining requirements that are neither observable normeasurable are integrated into the training scenario, but arewritten as instructional goals. Instructional goals have a similarwritten format to behavioral statements.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001241Substep 2Develop TestsIntroductionAs stated earlier, criterion objectives must be observable andmeasurable.  Therefore, all criterion objectives must bemeasured with either a written or performance test.  Of primaryconcern for written tests is clear communication of questions orproblems to students.Guidelines for testdevelopmentFollowing are some guidelines for developing tests.Write tests to the reading grade level of the target population.Don’t write tests with the intent of tricking students.Use correct grammar.Use plausible distracters.Use some type of illustration to clarify complex scenarios.Don’t give away the correct answer to a question in its stemor in a previous question.Give clear instructions to the examiner and students.Compare the test material to the criterion objective to ensurethat it measures the intended behavior and standard.Performance testguidelinesPerformance tests need to be structured correctly if students areto retain the instructional message.  Pushing students into theactual performance test before they’re ready causes frustration,confusion, and lack of motivation to concentrate on theremainder of the instruction.  The following are some guidelinesto follow for developing performance tests.Performance tests need to be demonstrated. This not onlyclarifies aspects of the procedure, but serves as a summaryfor the whole task.Give students enough practice before actual testing. If timepermits, let them practice until they feel confident with thescenario. Allow them to practice at least twice for complexscenarios.Identify appropriate safety precautions and procedures.Include any special instructions to the examiner in theInstructional Guidance. Special instructions might point outconsiderations for preparation, timing of certain events, oralternate plans.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Substep 3Develop Media DescriptionsPurposeThe purpose of this substep is to determine specific types ofmedia for each alternate media class from Step 5, then write abrief narrative describing specific types.How to developmedia descriptionsTo develop media descriptions, answer the following questions.Are materials readily available?  For example, if print media isneeded, are there existing manuals and illustrations tosupport the need?What are the production costs for different media within agiven class?How much time is available for development?How many times will the training be offered?  If it’s offeredone time, don’t spend the money for elaborate media.Is the media subject to frequent change?  This can also becostly for certain types of media.Identify resourcerequirementsAt this point, identify any resource requirements.  Doing this nowallows plenty of time for changes, revisions, etc.  Resourcerequirements include any type of hardware support for specificmedia such as projectors, cameras, dry marker boards, etc.Substep 4Develop Written OverviewPurposeThe purpose of this substep is to define how specific alternatemedia and resources are used in the training scenario or howthey’re used to help deliver the instructional message.DocumentationAs you write your overview, estimate and document the numberof hours needed for each training requirement. Base thisestimate on task performance data and personal experience.Substep 5Sequence Training RequirementsAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001243PurposeThe purpose of this substep is to structure the training scenario.Structuring allows students to comprehend relationships thatexist between concepts, skill and knowledge behaviors,activities, and tasks.DefinitionThere are two levels of structuring: (1) macro structuring, and (2)micro structuring.Macro structuring consists of the largest divisions by majorsubject matter or topic. Using this structuring allows thetraining scenario to be divided according to major work areas,systems, or levels of progression. Once this is complete,micro structuring can begin.Micro structuring simply allows potential training requirementsto be structured into major divisions. This involvessequencing activities into tasks and tasks into objectives.There are three ways to sequence these activities and tasksduring micro structuring: (1) by job performance order, (2) bypsychological order, and (3) by logical order.  These areexplained as follows.Sequencing by job performance order produces aninstructional environment that replicates the realenvironment.  It’s very effective in scenarios wherestudents must produce immediately. This tends to have ahigh level of psychological impact that translates intoquality job performance.Sequencing by psychological order focuses on theconcepts of known to unknown, simple to complex, andwhole to part-whole.  However, this type of sequencing issubjective; the analyst determines what’s known andunknown, simple and complex, etc.Sequencing by logical order is a combination of the firsttwo types and leans heavily toward whole to part-whole.Determine commonelementsDetermine whether or not any objectives (for concept-basedtraining requirements) have common elements. These objectivesare placed at the beginning of the training because theyrepresent concepts that are fundamental to several tasks. Forexample, the concept of physical force is fundamental to learninghow simple machines work. Therefore, instruction on thisconcept precedes instruction on specific machinery.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002PrerequisitesNext, determine if there are any skill and knowledge behaviorsthat are prerequisites for others. It may be beneficial to placethese into objectives and sequence them before others.  Also,while making this determination, look for chains of events thatmust be performed in specified order.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001245IDENTIFY HARDWARE FIDELITY REQUIREMENTSSTEP 7IntroductionBy this time, an analyst has formed a general idea of what thehardware requirements are for media classes identified in Step 5.However, the degree of hardware fidelity needs to bedetermined.  That is, how realistic must the hardware be tosupport the training scenario?  Also, this analysis helpsdetermine the degree of fidelity needed to teach individual skillbehaviors; this is possible because tasks are analyzed to the skilland knowledge behavior level (Steps 1 through 4). This preventsdevelopment of hardware training devices that perform morefunctions than are absolutely necessary to deliver theinstructional message.Substep 1Identify Hardware Fidelity RequirementsIntroductionThere are two aspects to fidelity requirements for any hardwaretraining device: (1) functional, and (2) physical. Each of theseaspects is analyzed for the quality or degree of stimulus,response, or feedback.PurposeThe purpose of this substep is to identify and analyze hardwarefor functional and physical fidelity requirements.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002How to identifyhardwarefunctional fidelityrequirementsExamine the media classes for both instructor-based and media-based delivery.  Specific hardware for these media classes isidentified by considering which major assemblies,subassemblies, or lower assembly units students come in contactwith (for a given training requirement).  Answer the followingquestions.Does the hardware have a functional impact? The functionalimpact of hardware consists of both stimuli and feedback.Therefore, it’s considered from both perspectives. If studentsmust receive information from hardware to perform a task ormake a decision, the answer to this question is “YES.”Is the stimulus/feedback difficult to understand? For example,a digital pressure gauge is easier to comprehend than ananalog pressure gauge; analog scales are continuous with aninfinite number of values from point A to point B and,therefore, it’s more difficult to determine an exact value.Is the stimulus/feedback difficult to understand because ofmotion, body position, or feel? This considers whether or notthe hardware is in motion during task performance, awkwardbody positions interfere with performance, and/ordiscrimination between some physical characteristics of thehardware makes it difficult to make a decision.Is there something unusual, abnormal, or dangerous aboutthe hardware? Use personal experience and good judgmentto answer this question. Careful consideration should begiven to scenarios with moving parts, explosives, and new ormodified tools.Note: Depending on a given response, an analyst may bedirected to label the hardware as having various levels of fidelity.ExampleA behavior requires the target population to use a new piece oftest equipment.  The test equipment is new only because amodification included an external manual adjustment.  Since thetest equipment has a functional impact, it requires “High” (H)functional fidelity; specifically, the external manual adjustment.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001247Functional fidelityUse the flowchart in Figure E-2 to determine the degree to whicheach piece of hardware must act like the real thing.Figure E-2 Functional FidelityStartFunctional FidelityFunctionalImpact?YesNoDifficult?YesMotion?YesHigh FidelityNoNoYesPossible HighFidelityUnusual?NoLow FidelitySeeFigure E-3How to determinephysical fidelityrequirementsNo matter what the response is during functional fidelity analysis,an analyst must determine the degree to which the hardwaremust look like the real thing.  Ask the following questions.Is the hardware acted upon directly? If students must come inphysical contact with the hardware, the answer to thisquestion is “YES.”Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002How to determinephysical fidelityrequirements(Continued)Is the hardware next to or connected to high (H) fidelityhardware and does it enhance students’ understanding? Insome cases, hardware may not provide stimuli, response, orfeedback; it’s merely next to or connected to hardware thatdoes.Is unaided judgment used to respond to hardware outputs(difficult response)?Are there many possible hardware configurations?  It’s simplyeasier for students to comprehend the overall scenario usinga single high (H) fidelity piece of hardware as opposed tonumerous low (L) fidelity components.Is there something unusual, abnormal, or dangerous aboutthe hardware?Again, depending on the response, an analyst may be directed tolabel hardware as “High” (H) fidelity, “Possible High” (PH) fidelity,“Low” (L) fidelity, or “Possible Low” (PL) fidelity.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001249Physical fidelityUse the flowchart in Figure E-3 to determine the degree to whichthe hardware must look like the real thing.Figure E-3 Physical FidelityFromFigure E-2Physical FidelityActedUpon?NoDifficult?YesNoYesHigh FidelityNext toor connectedto?NoYesPossibleHigh FidelityConfigurations?YesPossibleHigh FidelityContinueAppropriateAnalysisYesPossibleHigh FidelityNoNoUnusual?LowfidelitySubstep 2Perform Whole-Hardware AnalysisPurposeExampleThis analysis is intended to make the hardware training deviceappear as realistic as possible at minimal expense. Mosthardware training devices include components such as dials,switches, lights, etc., from the actual equipment. But, dependingon the training scenario, many of the components may benonfunctional.Consider, for example, what should be done with the fifthindicator in a group of five, if students receivestimuli/response/feedback only from the first four. It’s suggestedthat the fifth indicator be included as a “Low” (L) fidelitycomponent.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002Why includevariouscomponents?ConsideroperationalhardwareThere are two reasons to include these types of components.First, it makes the hardware training device look realistic;second, including a modest number shouldn’t add significantmaterial costs. Two-dimensional drawings or photographs canrepresent many of these low fidelity components.In some cases it may be more expensive to fabricate thehardware training device with low fidelity components than to usethe actual hardware. Will including low fidelity componentscontribute to learning?  Or would it be best and most effective touse actual hardware?Substep 3Compile Fidelity Recommendations Within TasksIntroductionPurposeHow to compileKeep in mind that the hardware requirements analyzed in theprevious steps/substeps are developed from potential behavioraltraining requirements. In turn, these behavioral trainingrequirements are developed from a given activity within a giventask.The purpose of this substep is to compile fidelity decisions withinthat given task.  The hardware requirements for a given activityare probably used in other activities of the same task.Therefore, these same hardware requirements are probablylabeled with varying fidelity levels. These fidelity labels, forcommon hardware requirements, must be compiled first.To compile fidelity recommendations within tasks, look at thehardware requirement for the first potential behavioral trainingrequirement of the first activity within the first task. Now, searchthe rest of the activities in the first task for the same hardwarerequirement. For this same hardware requirement, total thenumber of “High” (H) fidelity labels; do the same for the “PossibleHigh” (PH) fidelity labels, “Low” (L) fidelity labels, and “PossibleLow” (L) fidelity labels.Substep 4Compile Fidelity Recommendations Within BlocksAFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001251PurposeJust as some hardware is common to more than one activitywithin a task, some hardware may be common to more than onetask within a block. The purpose of this substep is to compilefidelity decisions within blocks.How to compileSearch the hardware requirements analyzed in Substep 3, withineach task, to identify common hardware requirements withinblocks of instruction.  The end result should be a hardwaretraining device that can be used in more than one unit and/orobjective.Substep 5Compile Final Fidelity RecommendationsSynopsisThe procedures for this substep are identical to procedures inSubsteps 3 and 4, only performed a step higher in the structureof the training scenario. The purpose of this substep is tocompile fidelity decisions within the entire course of instruction.That is, there may be hardware requirements that are common tomore than one block of instruction.  This subset is simply acompilation of the previous substeps in Step 7.STEP 8IDENTIFY INTERACTIVE COURSEWARE (ICW)FIDELITY REQUIREMENTSIntroductionResearch shows that ICW is a very powerful media in terms ofpresenting information; it allows development of conceptualskills, analytical skills, and psychomotor skills. It can take manyforms, including text-based and interactive video (IVD).PurposeThe purpose of this step is to determine the type of ICW bestsuited to training requirements.Substep 1Identify ICW Fidelity RequirementsAFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002BackgroundPotential training requirements that need to be presented with amedia class of ICW are already identified. This is done in Step 5.All potential skill-, knowledge-, and concept-based trainingrequirements within this media class are analyzed here forfidelity requirements.Why is ICWanalysis different?The analysis for ICW fidelity differs from that of hardware fidelityin the level of focus. In hardware fidelity analysis, the focus is onthe actual hardware required to support a behavior or concept.Here, the focus is on course content.ExampleFor example, a given task may require students to applyelectrical power to an aircraft’s avionics systems. An activity inthis task requires them to turn on the battery switch.  The skillbehavior, here, is to physically move the toggle switch from“OFF” to “ON.”  A knowledge behavior is the understanding whythe switch must be turned on; one concept used to helpunderstand this behavior is that of electron flow. If it’s alreadydetermined (from Step 5) that the media class for thesebehaviors is ICW, then the battery switch, associated systemknowledge, and concept of electron flow are analyzed for fidelityrequirements.How to conductICW analysisConduct the analysis by answering the following questions.Is the skill, knowledge, or concept difficult to understand?Consider whether or not it’s difficult to understand withoutseeing an animated representation.Do students come in contact with system components duringactual maintenance? If students are manipulating controls ormaking judgments based on system performance/status, theanswer to this question is “YES.”Is it difficult to make a response? Consider close coordinationbetween team members and quick cognitive or psychomotorreaction.Is the response based on specific system stimuli?  Stimulimay be in the form of feedback.Is there a high consequence for incorrect studentperformance? Consider what’s going to happen if studentsperform the activity incorrectly or out of sequence.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001253ICW functionalfidelityUse the flowchart in Figure E-4 to determine ICW functionalfidelity.Figure E-4 ICW Functional FidelityStartICW Functional FidelityDifficult?YesHigh FidelityContact?Response?Stimuli?NoYesNoNoNoLow FidelityYesYesConsequence?YesNoLow FidelityToFigureE-5AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002ICW physicalfidelityUse the flowchart in Figure E-5 to determine ICW physicalfidelity.Figure E-5 ICW Physical FidelityFromFigureE-3ICW Physical FidelityDifficult?YesHigh FidelityNoLow FidelityYesYesYesContact?NoYesConsequence?NoResponse?Stimuli?NoNoLow FidelitySubstep 2Compile Final ICW Fidelity RecommendationsPurposeThe purpose of this substep is to compile all ICW fidelity analysisdata into a cohesive package.  These final recommendations areused to develop ICW.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001255BackgroundConclusionsNotice that there’s no middle ground for the fidelity labels inSubstep 1.  Each skill, knowledge, or concept either needs to bepresented in detail or isn’t critical to understanding.Considering that both functional and physical fidelityrequirements can have either of these two labels, there are onlyfour possible scenarios that can exist for each type of trainingrequirement.  These scenarios are explained next.A low functional and low physical scenario indicates that thetraining requirement can be met with a text-based tutorial;there are no visual cues or system functions that studentsmust react to.  Text-based tutorials may take the form ofdiscussions on specific concepts, which are used later. Theymay also take the form of study aids that reinforce classroominstruction.A high functional and low physical scenario indicates that thetraining requirement can be met with animated graphics withtext support. Animated graphics illustrate abstract conceptswhile simulating some aspect of operation.A low functional and high physical scenario indicates that thetraining requirement can be met with static graphics.  Staticgraphics are generally used to clarify points.A high functional and high physical scenario indicates that thetraining requirement can be met with two-dimensionalpart-task simulations. Creating a performance environmentrequires animation, and this type of ICW is designed to givethe visual and auditory cues that go along with manipulationof controls. A two-dimensional part-task simulation can bedeveloped using computer animation, interactive video, andvariations/combinations of the two.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002IDENTIFY INSTRUCTIONAL FEATURESSTEP 9IntroductionThere are four aspects to any training scenario: (1) stimuli, (2)response monitoring, (3) feedback, and (4) next task or activity.Stimuli prompt students into action and come from one of twosources: (1) an instructor, or (2) hardware/alternate media.Cues from these sources give students information that leadsthem to proceed with a given performance.What students do after seeing, hearing, or feeling stimuli iscalled the response. In response to stimuli, students performa task or an activity. Student response must be monitored inone of two ways: (1) by an instructor, or (2) byhardware/alternate media.  The data gathered duringresponse monitoring is used to provide a degree of feedbackto the students.Feedback either reinforces student behavior or helps correctit, depending on the data received during responsemonitoring. Feedback may also prompt students to begin thenext task or activity; once this happens, feedback is thenconsidered stimuli.The feedback/stimuli that directs students to perform the nexttask or activity comes from (1) an instructor, or (2)hardware/alternate media.CommonalityNotice that there’s one thing in common for all four aspects.Either an instructor or hardware/alternate media controls thetraining scenario. Skill, knowledge, and concept trainingrequirements, to this point, are already determined as deliveredby the instructor or media.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001257PurposeEven though media-based delivery is directed for somebehaviors and concepts, it may be necessary for an instructor tocontrol one of the aspects of stimuli, response monitoring,feedback, or next activity. The purpose of this step is to identifyinstructional features for those skill/knowledge behaviors andconcepts with a media class of HW, ICW, or EXH; specifically,which (instructor or media) controls one of the given aspects andwhat features are assigned to them. Each hardware trainingdevice (or supporting hardware), under these media classes, isanalyzed in this step.Substep 1Identify Stimuli Controls and FeaturesHow to identifyLook at the first behavior or concept with a hardware requirementand define the stimuli. Once this is known, answer the followingquestions to identify which (instructor or media) controls stimuliand whether features are preprogrammed or variable:Does the hardware control the stimuli? If dealing with asimple task, such as remove and replace, instructors caneffectively control the stimuli and keep the training scenariorealistic.Does the hardware control the intensity of stimuli?  Intensityis defined as pitch, tone, volume, or duration for audio stimuliand brightness or duration for visual stimuli.Is the intensity preprogrammed (PP) or variable (VAR)?Preprogrammed means that each student sees the exact,same presentation no matter when instruction is given.Variable means that the presentation is adapted to individualstudent needs.  One or the other is included as a feature; it’ssimply a choice an analyst must make.  This position ismaintained in the remaining analysis of Step 8.Does the hardware control the rate of stimuli? Considerwhether or not the hardware training device must emulatesystem operation.Is the rate preprogrammed (PP) or variable (VAR)?

A signalis defined as the instructional message, whatever it may be.Noise is defined as anything that interferes with or blocks thesignal; it distracts students’ attention from the trainingscenario. If the training scenario is very active/interactive, thehardware is designed to control this feature.Is the signal-to-noise ratio preprogrammed (PP) or variable(VAR)? Refer to the clarification in the third question.Substep 2Identify Response Monitoring Controls and FeaturesHow to identifyConsider the following:Is hardware freeze capability required? Freeze capabilitystops the training scenario temporarily, after a specifiednumber of student errors, a fatal error, or when time limits areexceeded. Consider whether or not the nature of the trainingscenario prompts frequent mistakes.Are the freeze criteria preprogrammed (PP) or variable(VAR)?Do students remove the hardware freeze? If instructors areavailable to do this, let them. This ensures they’re aware ofindividual needs and puts the human factor back into thetraining scenario. If students remove the freeze, remediationmust be included; this remediation is designed to keepstudents from making the same mistake twice.Is remediation preprogrammed (PP) or variable (VAR)?Substep 3Identify Feedback Controls and FeaturesHow to identifySpecific feedback must be identified before continuing. Use thefollowing questions to identify controls and features for feedback:Is feedback provided by the hardware? Consider how muchcontrol is given to the hardware already and whether or notthe hardware is used in a self-paced training scenario.Does the hardware provide the consequences of a falseresponse? If the hardware is to simulate the actual equipmentor provide remediation, the answer is "YES."Is the feedback preprogrammed (PP) or variable (VAR)?AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001259Substep 4Identify Next Task/Activity Controls and FeaturesHow to identifyThe next task/activity must be identified before continuing. Usethe following questions to identify controls and features.Does the hardware control whether or not students proceedto the next activity? Consider the complexity of the trainingscenario.Is the next activity variable?Is the variability derived from student response or studentscore? Variability derived from student responseacknowledges the many possible hardware configurations;this feature causes hardware to simulate actual equipmentand students are free to treat it as such (freeplay).  Variabilityderived from student score limits the possible action a studentmay take.  This feature is best suited for tasks or activitiesthat are critical in nature or to reinforce the instructionalmessage to lower skill levels.Note: The last six steps of the 15-step process are brief andsummarized below.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002PREPARE TRAINING EQUIPMENT ANALYSIS SUMMARY ANDFUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONSTEP 10SynopsisThis document is used to record training equipment designrequirements.  It’s used by the Program Office (PO) to preparethe Request For Proposal (RFP).  The format will vary dependingon SPO requirements.AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001261PREPARE COURSE CONTROL DOCUMENTSSTEP 11SynopsisPurposeA proposed Course Chart (CC) and Course TrainingStandard/Specialty Training Standard (CTS/STS) are nowderived from the analysis.  This is an AETC-specific requirement.The analysis from this ISD process provides the majority of theinformation needed for development of the CC and CTS/STS.Estimates of course lengths, instructional design, hardwaretraining devices, and AETC-furnished equipment can be derived.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002PREPARE INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS AND TESTSSTEP 12SynopsisPreparing instructional materials and tests requires preparationof criterion objectives (Steps 6 and 11). These criterionobjectives are listed in the appropriate CCDs and form the basisfor this step. Use the analysis data from Steps 3 and 4 whendeveloping test items for criterion objectives.  AETC-specificrequirements and guidance are in ATCR 52-3 for testingpolicy/procedures for resident training, and ATCR 50-21 for FTDcourses. Guidance and format requirements for training literature(used in resident training) can be found in ATCR 52-2 and ATCR50-21 (for FTD courses).AFH 36-2235VOLUME 31 NOVEMBER 2001263STEP 13VALIDATE INSTRUCTIONSynopsisValidation begins as soon as proposed CCDs are printed in theirfinal form. The initial step of the validation phase makes copiesof CCDs available to MAJCOMs, FTDs, and/or the Prime Centerresponsible for weapon systems support (for their review andrecommendations).  Review and recommendations by theseagencies includes providing instruction to a small group ofspecialists. Time constraints placed on this test bed determinethe extent of the validation phase.AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2002STEPS 14 AND 15CONDUCT AND EVALUATE TRAININGSynopsisThese steps represent the final proof of the ISD process. They’reaccomplished in a formal training environment at the operationalsite. At this point, conduct, management, and evaluation of thecourse are the responsibility of the using agency. If traininganalysis and development are performed properly, the result is atraining program that instructors are familiar with, and hardwaretraining devices that are justified.Additional helpIf you feel that you need additional information, you may write the374 Training Development Squadron and request a copy of theirprocedures manual, which is available on IBM-compatible floppydisk.
