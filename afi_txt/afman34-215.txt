Applicability.  This  manual  prescribes relationships  of  Nonappropriated  Fund Instrumentalities (NAFI) in the CMIP with the Air Force Financial Management Fund (AFFMF) and with banks associated with the CMIP.  HAF/A1S is the waiver approving authority for non-tiered requirements in this AFMAN. 1.2.  CMIP System Overview: 1.2.1.  Background.    The  CMIP  provides  for  consolidation  of  cash  resources  among  AF NAFIs.      Air  Force  Services  Activity,  Financial  Management  &  Comptroller  Directorate, Treasury  Branch,  Bank  Products  and  Services  Branch  (AFSVA/FMNTB)  is  the  central manager of the program for the AFFMF.  The AFFMF is the custodial fund for AF NAFs and serves  as  the  central  processor  for  all  participating  NAFIs.    The  AFFMF  presently  uses  a principal concentration bank, and maintains accounts in financial institutions on or near AF bases  worldwide.    The  CMIP  system  uses  electronic  fund  transfers  (EFTs)  to  accomplish cash consolidation so that AFFMF cash managers can provide a more efficient use of funds belonging to the participating NAFIs.  Air Force Services Activity, Financial Management & Comptroller  Directorate,  Treasury  Branch,  Portfolio  and  Working  Capital  Section (AFSVA/FMNTP)  FMNTP  invests  excess  funds  in  securities  authorized  by  Department  of Defense  (DoD)  until  such  time  as  needed  for  operational  or  capital  expenditures.    The  Air Force  Services  Financial  Management  System  (AFSFMS)  automatically  generates  the  cash transactions  reported  on  CMIP  except  for  the  ACH  transactions  received  directly  by  Air Force Services Activity, Financial Management & Comptroller Directorate, Treasury Branch, Cash Operations and Integration Section (AFSVA/FMNTC)AFSVA/FMNTC. 1.2.2.  Cash and Savings.  A professional staff centrally manages the program to ensure that optimum rates of return are received on a national basis, that federal and DoD guidelines are followed,  and  proper  safeguards  and  internal  controls  are  established  for  negotiable instruments.        NAF  funds  are  invested  into  authorized  transactions  as  outlined  within Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 1015.15, Enclosure 9, Treasury Management and NAF  Investments.    Investments  can  only  be  made  by  AFSVA/FMNTP.    Other  offices administering NAFs will not engage in any investment activity.   1.2.3.  Deposits.    NAFIs  (Force  Support  Squadron,  FSS  activities)  perform  their  business functions,  prepare  deposits,  and  take  the  deposits  to  the  central  cashier  for  consolidation.  The central cashier deposits the consolidated deposit in the field bank, and the deposit slip is returned to the Nonappropriated Fund Accounting Office (NAF AO).  The individual activity at  off-base  sites  without  a  central  cashier  deposit  their  funds  directly  with  their  local  bank and  notifies  their  host  NAF  AO  central  cashier  of  the  deposit  amount.    The  central  cashier records  the  deposits  on  an  AF  Form  1877,  NAF  Central  Cashier  Control  Log.    The completed  form  is  then  processed  through  the  Shared  Service  Center  (SSC)  and  flows directly  to  the  depositing  NAFI’s  general  ledger  and  CMIP.      Individual  deposits  are identified by base and NAFI.    FMNTC will monitor the funds deposited into the field banks and process entries to consolidate the excess funds into the principal concentration account.  Bases  located  outside  the  Continental  United  States  (CONUS)  make  deposits  to  their 8 AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 designated banks, normally the Military Banking Facility (MBF), in foreign currency and/or United States (US) dollars.  AFSVA/FMNTC routinely transfers funds from these designated banks to the principal concentration bank or establishes a process whereby the MBF initiates a transfer to the principal stateside concentration bank.  AFSVAFMNTC centrally purchases all foreign currencies or has a pre-arranged agreement with the DoD MBF to purchase funds and  deposits  the  currency  into  designated  foreign  currency  accounts,  to  meet  base-level requirements.   1.2.4.  Disbursements.    The  Air  Force  Services  Activity,  Services  Directorate,  SSC  issues checks/EFTs  as  required  (general)  and  notifies  AFSVA/FMNTB  of  such  check  issues  (and related transactions) daily.  The transactions update the CMIP system, and reduce the issuing NAFIs cash-in-bank CMIP balance at the time the checks are reported to AFFMF.  AFFMF maintains  an  account  at  the  principal  concentration  bank  for  clearing  of  US  dollar  check issues.  At the beginning of each business day, the principal concentration bank transmits a file of checks cleared to AFFMF.  AFSVA/FMNTB uses this data to match against the file of outstanding  check  issues  and  posts  any  variances  to  the  CMIP  statement  for  that  Date  of Business (DOB) being processed.   1.2.4.1.  SSC makes all US dollar and foreign currency payments on behalf of the bases and  generates  the  entries  to  post  to  CMIP  (a  few  exceptions  exist  for  overseas  Value Added  Tax  (VAT)  and  other  programs).    The  AFFMF  maintains  foreign  currency  bank accounts  used  to  support  the  requirements  in  four  currencies  (Euro,  Sterling,  Won  and Yen).  1.2.4.2.  Electronic  payments  and  account  creation/setups  forms  require  financial information  for  processing.    Standard  templates  are  provided  by  AFSVA/FMNTC,  for usage organization wide.  Forms include Wire Transfer Requests.   1.2.5.  Transfers.  The CMIP system processes transfers of funds between NAFIs serviced by the same NAF AO.  Transfers are primarily used when entries are initially posted to a wrong NAFI/CMIP  account,  and  must  be  transferred  to  the  correct  account.    For  example,  CMIP remittance  posts  to  base’s  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation  (MWR)  CMIP  account  and  the funds  belong  to  Lodging.    In  addition,  the  SSC  uses  Cash  Transfers  (CTs)  exclusively  to move funds between bases CMIPs and central fund CMIP and MAJCOM(s).   1.2.6.  Remittances.    Remittances  are  transactions  that  are  generally  posted  by  FMNTB  for base level NAFIs.  Examples include P-CARD transactions, deposit validations/adjustments, US  Department  of  Agriculture,  Defense  Finance  Accounting  Service,  dividends  and  other miscellaneous receipts. 1.2.7.  Related  Systems.    The  SSC  sends  transactions  to  AFSVA/FMNTB  representing vendor, payroll, Workers’ Compensation, Unemployment Compensation, Property/Liability, Aero Club, Temporary Lodging Facility (TLF) assessment, deposits to a Severance Account (SEV)  (accumulation  of  cash  to  fund  future  severance  of  foreign  national  and  CONUS employees),  and  so  forth.    Monthly,  AFSVA/FMNTB  sends  SEV  statements  only  to  those NAF AOs having  accounts.   These statements are usually sent  by the third business  day of each month.    AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 9 1.3.  Participation in CMIP.  Participation is mandatory for all NAFIs serviced by the SSC and under the jurisdiction of the AFSVA.   1.3.1.  With  technology  advances  in  the  financial  industry  constant  emerging,  alternative methods  for  transaction  processing  introduced  by  the  Treasury  Branch  to  support  DoDI 1015.15  and  AFMAN  34-215,  Procedures  For  the  Cash  Management  and  Investment Program protocols for the collection and consolidation of NAF funds, are approved by FM, with compliance by the NAFIs mandatory.   1.4.  Overdraft  CMIP  Accounts.  AFSVA/FMNTB  takes  the  following  actions  when  a  NAFI goes into an overdraft status: 1.4.1.  If no action is taken to correct the overdraft, AFSVA/FMNT will transfer any savings account balance to cover the overdraft. If there are insufficient funds in the savings account to  cover  the  overdraft,  the  funds  will  be  transferred  from  the  MAJCOM  account  by AFSVA/FMNT to the base NAFI's account. If the NAFI is a lodging fund AFSVA/FMNFL is  centrally  managing  the  cash  balances;  the  funds  necessary  to  cover  the  overdraft  will  be moved  from  the  Air  Force  Lodging  Fund  (AFLF)  lodging  fund  account  to  the  base-level lodging fund by AFSVA/FMNFL.   1.4.1.1.  Adds a special announcement to the daily CMIP message to notify the base and AFSVA/FM that a NAFI is in an overdraft status.   1.4.1.2.  Contacts the SSC on the same day.  1.4.1.3.  Monitors the NAFI for 5 workdays to ensure that corrective action is taken. 1.4.2.  If no action is taken to correct the overdraft, AFSVA/FM will transfer funds from the respective  Air  Force  Central  Fund  CMIP  account  to  the  base  CMIP  account.    Air  Force Lodging Fund (AFLF) manages all lodging funds and overdrafts will be transferred from the AFLF to the base-level lodging fund.   1.4.3.  FM or Base Installation will send a message to FMNTB and SSC informing them of the corrective action taken for the overdraft NAFI's account.   1.4.4.  AFSVA/FM  determines  whether  an  assessment  of  pecuniary  liability  is  appropriate according to AFI 34-202, Protecting Nonappropriated Fund Assets.   1.4.5.  Any CT reported through the CMIP system which would cause a NAFI to go into an overdraft  status  will  be  identified  during  processing  and  rejected.    An  error  message explaining  the  reason  for  rejecting  the  transaction  will  be  included  on  the  daily  CMIP statement.    SSC  will  coordinate  rejects  and  corrective  action  with  the  installation  and AFSVA/FMNTB. 10 AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 Chapter 2 BANK RELATIONSHIPS 2.1.  Field Banks.  All field banks are designated by AFSVA/FMNTC and are generally located on base, but can be off-base if an on-base bank is not available.  The central cashier makes all deposits to their designated field bank unless the base has a waiver to allow the activities to make deposits.  A base may have more than one field bank if the base has an off-base site.  NAFIs are not authorized to open field bank accounts without a waiver from AFSVA/FMNTC.   2.2.  Field Bank Account Ownership.  The field bank account and monies deposited belong to AFFMF.  NAFI claims are against the AFFMF (as their bank) rather than the field bank or other CMIP affiliated banks.  Only AFFMF may request bank statements or copies of bank statements from the field bank.  These statements are the property of AFFMF and not the individual NAFI or  servicing  NAF  AO.    If  a  field  bank  attempts  to  deliver  such  documents,  they  should  be refused,  and  the  bank  instructed  to  mail  them  to  AFFMF,  2261  Hughes  Avenue,  Suite  156, Lackland AFB, TX  78236-9854.  The AFFMF pays the majority of the bank service fees for the maintenance  and  usage  of  the  field  bank  accounts  through  a  combination  of  compensating balances and fees.  However, fees associated with deposit slips, night depository bags, and other special  services,  if  any,  are  to  be  paid  by  the  NAFI  concerned.    If  a  field  bank  official  should inquire  about  compensation,  notify  AFSVA/FMNTC  immediately.    AFSVA/FMNTC,  in  turn, will contact the bank.    2.3.  Cash  Back  Arrangements.  Any  arrangement  with  a  field  bank  to  obtain  cash  for deposited checks is entirely at the risk of the NAFIs involved and must be supported by a deposit ticket which shows the total deposit, less cash received, and net amount deposited.  The Resource Manager  (RM)  makes  all  cash  back  arrangements.    CMIP  participation  does  not  prevent  such arrangements,  but  they  should  be  undertaken  only  with  assurance  of  proper  internal  controls.  The internal controls should identify all personnel authorized to obtain cash for deposited checks and should require that an individual other than the one receiving the cash validates the deposit ticket received from the bank.  Debit advices cannot be used for cash back arrangements.   2.4.  Concentration  Banks.  Concentration  banks  are  primary  banks  to  which  monies  are consolidated  in  order  to  optimize  the  AFFMF's  cash  management  techniques.    Concentration banks are not the final depository of all CMIP monies, but are simply agents hired to perform a check clearing and staging function.  AFSVA/FMNTP temporarily invests excess funds in many institutions throughout the US pending disbursement.  NAF AOs or NAFIs are not to contact a concentration  bank.    All  contact  and  interactions  with  a  concentration  bank  are  made  by AFSVA/FMNTC.   2.5.  Merchant  Agreements.  All  Merchant  Agreements must be approved by  AFSVA/FMNT.  A Merchant Agreement is a contract with a bank to allow the NAFI to accept Visa/MasterCard, other  credit  card  type  or  the  FSS  Gift  Card  as  payment  for  merchandise  or  services  rendered.  Base NAFIs pay all transaction fees associated with these types of accounts. AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 11 Chapter 3 CMIP ACCOUNTS 3.1.  NAFI Account Numbers.  Each NAFI is assigned a 10-digit CMIP account number.  SSC and  NAF  AO  use  this  number  for  reporting  all  banking  transactions.    The  account  number  is broken down into four segments as follows: 3.1.1.  Digits  1-2  =  Branch  or  Service  (i.e.,  Air  Force  =  57  not  included  on  daily  CMIP statements). 3.1.2.  Digits 3-5= Base ID. 3.1.3.  Digits 6-7= NAFI. 3.1.4.  Digits 8-9= Site. 3.1.5.  Digit 10= Check Digit (ensures authenticity). 3.1.6.  FMNTB provides SSC, base, and AFSVA/FM new CMIP account numbers. 3.2.  Daily Statements.  The CMIP system generates a daily banking statement which represents the  NAFIs  cash-in-bank.    The  statements  are  forwarded  to  a  computer  server  administered  by SSC and distributed to the NAF base liaison e-mail addresses.   3.3.  Payment  of  Interest.  The interest rate paid to participating NAFIs is set by  AFSVA/FM and is based upon the net return of the AFFMF investment portfolio.  NAFIs earn interest based upon the month-to-date average balance, compounded monthly.   3.4.  Posting of CMIP Interest Earned.  The interest earned for the prior month is posted to the CMIP  statement  on  the  first  business  day  of  the  current  month.    SSC  prepares  General  Ledger Adjustment Form (GLAF) to record accruals. 3.5.  Consolidation  or  Establishment  of  NAFIs.  AFSVA/CC  approves  all  requests  for consolidation  of  NAFIs  or  establishment  of  a  new  NAFI.    The  requesting  NAFI  provides AFSVA/FMNTB  five  workdays  advance  notice  to  allow  time  to  establish  CMIP  account numbers and provide conversion instructions.  If the NAFI requires a new field bank account, at least 30 workdays advance notice to AFSVA/FMNTC is required.   3.6.  Dissolution  of  a  NAFI.  AFSVA/CC  approves  requests  for  dissolution  of  a  NAFI.    The requesting  NAFI  gives  AFSVA/FMNTB  four  workdays  advance  notice.    AFSVA/FMNTB provides dissolution instructions.  After the official dissolution date, AFSVA/FMNTB officially closes  the  NAFI  CMIP  account  when  all  outstanding  checks  have  cleared  the  bank  and  a  final deposit validation is performed.    3.7.  MBF  Closures/Changes.  Contact  AFSVA/FMNTC  immediately  when  notified  that  your depository  bank  will  close  or  merge  with  another  bank.    NAF  AOs  will  not  enter  into  any agreements to close or open any bank accounts.  (See 3.9 for bank account closures.)   3.8.  Opening Field Bank Accounts.  AFSVAFMNTC opens all field bank accounts.  The NAF AO  notifies  AFSVA/FMNTC  of  the  requirement  a  minimum  of  30  days  prior  to  needing  the account.    Pertinent  account  information,  provided  by  AFSVA/FMNTC,  is  exchanged  with  the field  bank  official,  i.e.,  account  number,  bank's  routing  number,  initial  deposit  slip  order,  etc.  AFSVA/FMNTC provides the field bank with a letter of instruction and all other documentation 12 AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 required by the bank to establish the account.  The bank official may request certain information that can only be furnished by the NAFIs, such as change fund requirements.  NAF AO personnel may relay this information to the bank.   3.9.  Closing Field Bank Accounts.  AFSVA/FMNTC closes all field bank accounts.  The NAF AO  notifies  AFSVA/FMNTC  when  an  account  is  no  longer  required.    AFSVA/FMNTC officially informs the field bank of the closure by letter and transfers any remaining funds to the concentration  bank.    Upon  completion  of  the  final  deposit  validation,  AFSVA/FMNTC  deletes the account from the Cash Subsidiary database. AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 13 Chapter 4 FIELD BANK DEPOSITS 4.1.  General  Information  Concerning  Deposits.  The  central  cashier  makes  deposits  to designated AFFMF field bank accounts.  Deposits are made within one business day of receipt unless written approval  to make deposits  less often has been  granted  according to  AFI 34-202.  Bases  making  check  deposits  to  the  local  MBF  should  include  an  adding  machine  tape  of  all checks in their deposit to support the correct amount and count on the deposit ticket.  (T-0) 4.1.1.  Depositing  Checks  using  the  Desktop  Deposits  Program.    When  using  the  Desktop Deposits  Program  check  conversion  program  provided  by  the  AFSVA/FMNTC,  the  central cashier scans each check online via specialized check scanning hardware.  These checks are converted  into  electronic  transactions  and  automatically  transmitted  to  the  Federal  Reserve Bank for collection.  The collections from all NAFIs are deposited directly into the US dollar concentration bank account.  4.2.  Ordering  Deposit  Slips.  The  initial  order  of  deposit  slips  is  made  by  AFSVA/FMNTC when the new account is opened.  Thereafter, the NAF AO orders deposit slips directly from the field  bank or by contacting AFSVA/FMNTC.  The NAF  AO is  responsible for the payment of their deposit  slips.  The  account  title on the deposit slip has "Air  Force  Financial Management Fund" printed on the front.   4.3.  US  Dollar  Deposit  Reporting.  The Central Cashier records the deposits on the AF Form 1877  with  the  bank  code  of  “DP”.    The  form  is  then  processed  through  the  SSC  and  updates general  ledger  and  CMIP.    4.3.1.    Reporting  Check  Deposit  under  Desktop  Deposits.  When checks are scanned using the Desktop Deposits Program, the bank code of “OT” is used on AF Form 1877.   4.4.  US Dollar Checks Drawn on Foreign Banks.  On occasion, a customer may present a US dollar  check  drawn  on  a  foreign  bank  to  an  activity  for  payment  of  services  or  goods.    These checks are easily identifiable by the bank name printed on the check, and normally the check will not  contain  the  US  standard  Magnetic  Ink  Character  Recognition  (MICR)  encoding  on  the bottom  of  a  check.    While  the  check  is  written  in  US  dollars,  it  is  considered  a  "foreign  item" since  the  funds  cannot  be  collected  within  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  check  collection  system.  Field  banks  may  either  process  these  checks  or  return  them  to  the  NAFI  as  an  "uncollectible item."  If the field bank returns the check as an "uncollectible item," the NAFI can forward the check  to  AFSVA/FMNTB  for  collection  assistance.    If  the  field  bank  processes  the  check,  the item will be posted as a part of the deposit and then debited back against the account.  The field bank will not give credit until the funds have actually been collected from the foreign bank.  The collection  process  can  take  from  several  weeks  to  several  months.    There  is  normally  a substantial  service  fee  associated  with  these  transactions.    AFSVA/FMNTB  will  pass  these charges  (when  identifiable)  to  the  MWR  fund  at  the  base  making  the  deposit.    If  local commanders  direct  the  acceptance  of  these  checks  as  a  customer  service,  the  NAF  AO  should implement a charge to offset some or all of the cost of providing this service.   4.4.1.  AF Form1877 (for further instructions, please refer to program training aid, SSC TA-AFSFMS-09).    The  AF  Form  1877  is  used  to  report  the  consolidated  daily  deposits  to  the SSC.  Accurate AF Form 1877 is critical to the reconciliation process and used to match the 14 AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 actual base deposit to the activity revenue reported on the daily AF Form1876.  The Central Cashier  consolidates  activity  deposit  information  on  an  AF  Form  1877  using  the  AFSFMS for processing input of 1877.   4.4.2.  Requesting Approval.  IMPORTANT:  After all deposits are entered on the AF Form 1877, the central cashier must verify the AF Form 1877, the central cashier must verify the AF  Form  1877  to  ensure  the  1877  total  cash  and  checks  equal  the  total  amount  from  the validated  field  bank  deposit  slips.    Once  completed,  the  central  cashier  requests  approval from the Resource Manager (RM) or designee.  RM or Designee review and approve.   4.4.3.  What  to  do  if  AFSFMS  is  down.    Bases  have  up  to  five  days  to  transmit  AF  Form 1877.  In the event the system is down after five days, bases will initiate manual submission of all field bank deposit slips via cr.ssc@afsv.net orMyPers Incident.  A notice will be sent to the bases’ mailbox to notify them when system is operational.  Base can then resume with the submission of AF Form 1877.   4.5.  Foreign  Currency  (FC)  Deposit  Reporting.  NAFIs  are  authorized  to  deposit  local currency into the existing AFFMF foreign currency accounts.  Personal foreign currency checks are not authorized for deposit.  If a vendor check issued in foreign currency is returned, contact AFSVA/FMNTB  for corrective action.   If the local  field  bank will not  accept  foreign  currency cash  deposits,  NAFIs  should  attempt  to  exchange  the  currency  for  dollars  at  another  MWR activity  authorized  to  sell  foreign  currency  to  customers.    The  exchange  eliminates  a  currency exchange loss at the field bank due to reconversion.  Currency that NAFIs are unable to deposit or  exchange  internally,  is  converted  to  dollars,  deposited  into  the  AFFMF  dollar  account,  and reported via CMIP in accordance with paragraph 4.3.  If a FC is deposited to an existing foreign bank  account;  report  deposit  using  the  “FC”  on  AF  Form  1877.    The  NAF  AO  will  notify AFSVA/FMNT  by  message  of  all  anticipated  foreign  currency  deposits  in  excess  of $100,000.00,  such  as  those  generated  by  an  open  house,  at  least  10  working  days  prior  to  the event.  (T-0) 4.6.  Credit Card Deposit Reporting.  The NAF AO/activity settles each credit card terminal or Point  of  Sale  (POS)  system  equipment  daily  and  transmits  the  credit  card  activity  detail  to  the central credit card processor.  The processor releases daily online credit card reports for users to view  an  electronic  bank  file  which  interfaces  with  AFSFMS.    The  processor  also  submits  the transactions  for  payment  and  two  days  later  provides  an  electronic  settlement  file  to AFSVA/FMNTB which interfaces with AFSFMS and CMIP.  The credit card settlement file in turn updates CMIP and General Ledger.   4.7.  Off-Base  Deposit  Reporting.  One  or  more  NAFIs  may  make  deposits  to  more  than  one bank.  An example is a recreation area operating at a remote site and not near the on-base bank.  Deposits are made to a bank near the recreation area.  In this instance, report deposits as outlined in  paragraph  4.3,  except  use  the  bank  code  “BA”,  “OB”  or  “OT”,  designated  by AFSVA/FMNTB, on the AF Form 1877. 4.8.  Returned  Checks.  All  returned  checks  are  returned  to  AFSVA/FMNTB  by  the  US Treasury or Air Force Concentration Bank.  The checks are then re-presented electronically for collection on paydays (1st and 15th) by the SSC and if unsuccessful the base is then charged for the return check and it is  submitted for collection through the Treasury  Offset  Program  (TOP).  In  the  event  a  returned  check  is  returned  to  NAF  AO  by  the  local  bank,  the  check  is  to  be forwarded to AFSVA/FMNTB who will in turn initiate collection efforts.   AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 15 4.9.  Debit/Credit  Memo  Corrections.  All  debit/credit  memos  posted  by  the  field  bank  are posted to CMIP by AFSVA/FMNTB during the monthly deposit validation process. 16 AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 Chapter 5 CHECK STOCKS AND SIGNATURE REQUIREMENTS 5.1.  General Information Concerning Checks.  There are two types of check stock: 5.1.1.  General Purpose (vendor and payroll). 5.1.2.  Foreign Currency (overseas only). 5.2.  All check types have an 8-digit check number for CMIP reporting purposes.  The first three digits identify the base and the last five digits are the actual check number.  Not all foreign currency  checks  have  the  complete  8-digit  check  number  printed  on  the  check  due  to  the different  banking  regulations  in  each  country.    If  the  check  number  imprinted  is  less  than  five positions, zero fill to the left when reporting the foreign currency check issue. 5.2.1.  Ordering Check Stocks.  SSC orders all laser check stock paper and AFSVA/FMNTC orders  all  pre-printed  check  stock  (Value  Added  Tax  (VAT),  remote  site,  and  foreign currency).  OCONUS budgets and pays for designated check stock.  Check stocks should be inventoried  on  a  regular  basis  to  ensure  accountability,  an  adequate  supply,  and accomplishment of reorders in a timely manner. SSC records check numbers in AFSFMS.   5.2.1.1.  NAF  AOs  send  check  stock  reorders  by  encrypted  email  to  AFSVA/FMNTC using the following format.   5.2.1.2.  Check Type Required:   5.2.1.3.

Check Number Sequence Ordered. 5.2.1.12.3.  Approximate Delivery Date. 5.2.1.12.4.  New Check Order Verification Instruction. AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 17 5.2.2.  NAF AO should contact AFSVA/FMNTC if check order confirmation is not received within  15  days  of  the  check  order  date.    This  is  to  ensure  check  orders  are  received  and processed in a timely manner.   5.3.  Signature  Requirements  on  Checks.  All  bank  authorized  signatory  changes  must  be processed by AFSVA/FMNTC.  The maximum number of authorized signatories for each check writing location is five.  An additional two signatories is authorized for OCONUS locations for VAT offices located outside of the NAF AO.   5.4.  Signature  Changes.  Signature  cards  for  all  field  banks  worldwide  are  maintained  and signatory  changes  are  processed  by  AFSVA/FMNTC.    Requests  for  bank  account  signatory changes are submitted by e-mail to AFSVA/FMNTC advising of a signatory change.  Requests for  changes  on  the  OCONUS  DoD  Military  Banking  Facilities  (MBF),  AFSVA/FMNTC completes the account holder information on the applicable bank’s electronic signature card and forwards the signature card to the check writing location who adds the names of the authorized signers as indicated in 5.5.1. and 5.5.2.   5.4.1.

AFSVA/FMNTC prepares the new signature card and provides the information to the MBF  for  update.    Once  the  signature  card  is  ready,  AFSVA/FMNTC  will  notify  the installation  to  have  all  (new  and  current)  authorized  signers  visit  the  MBF  to  sign  the  new signature card.  Once all signers have signed, the authorized signers are valid. 5.5.  Check Numbering.  Issue all checks in numerical order.  5.6.  Reporting  US  Dollar General  Checks.  Check issue disbursement requests flow from the base to the SSC who in turn issues the check and updates general ledger and decreases the base CMIP account.  5.7.  Reporting  US  Dollar  Void  Checks.  If  a  check  is  spoiled  during  preparation  or  voided prior  to  issue,  the  SSC  generates  a  Check  Void  (CV)  in  AFSFMS  and  sends  an  email  to AFSVA/FMNTB for validation and ensure CV to flow to CMIP using the banking system.   5.8.  Stop  Payment  Action,  US  Dollar  Checks.  AFSVA/FM  or  SSC  submits  a  stop  payment request  and submits a Stop Payment Request form to AFSVA/FMNTB in the following format: 5.8.1.  Request Date. 5.8.1.1.  Requested By. 5.8.1.2.  Check Number. 5.8.1.3.  Date of Check Issue. 5.8.1.4.  Payee Name. 5.8.1.5.  Check Amount. 5.8.1.6.  Reason for Stop Payment. 5.8.2.  AFSVA/FMNTB makes the inquiry to see if the check is paid or outstanding.  If the check is paid, the paid check information is provided and no action is taken.  If the check is outstanding,  a  stop  payment  is  initiated.    On  the  following  business  day,  another  check inquiry  is  initiated  to  make  sure  the  check  did  not  pay  overnight.    Once  the  stop  payment process is complete, FMNTB notifies SSC to generate a CV.  The CV flows through CMIP and credits the check amount back to the check issuing CMIP account and removes the check from the outstanding check file. 5.9.  Foreign  Currency.  Foreign  currency  checks  pay  against  foreign  currency  disbursement accounts for employee payroll, vendor and construction payments.  AFSVA/FMNTC purchases all  foreign  currency  to  meet  daily  usage.    Unusually  large  requirements  such  as  employee bonuses,  fixed  asset  purchases,  and  construction  payments  require  additional  foreign  currency.  Ten  days  prior the  NAF  AO  notifies AFSVA/FMNTC of the forthcoming payment to ensure adequate funds are available to preclude a  bank  overdraft.    Overdrawn  accounts  incur  additional  expense  and  are  not  an  acceptable banking practice.  to  disbursing  unusually large  disbursements, 5.10.  Reporting  Foreign Currency Checks.  Foreign currency check issue requests flow from the base to the SSC and updates general ledger and decreases the base CMIP account.  5.11.  Reporting  Foreign  Currency  Void  Checks.  If a check is  spoiled during preparation or void prior to issue, SSC generates a CV which flows to CMIP.   AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 19 5.12.  Stop Payment Action, Foreign Currency Checks.  Authorized NAF AO personnel may initiate  stop  payment  actions  through  the  local  MBF  or  bank,  or  provide  the  following information  in  email  to  AFSVA/FMNTB.

After the void is completed an email will be sent to  FMNTB  to  void  the  check  which  will  credit  the  check  dollar  value  back  to  the  check issuing  CMIP  account  and  remove  the  foreign  currency  check  from  the  outstanding  check file.   5.13.  Corrections to Check Issue and Void Transactions Reported.  AFSVA/FMNTB makes all  corrective  actions  on  check  issues  or  check  voids.    Corrective  actions  relating  to  dollar amounts  appear  as  remittances  on  the  daily  CMIP  statements.    The  FM,  SSC  or  NAF  AO requests  corrective  action  by  sending  a  message  containing  the  following  information  to FMNTB: 5.13.1.  Date of CMIP statement on which the error occurred. 5.13.2.  Full 8-digit check number. 5.13.3.  Correct check information. 5.13.4.

A base may only transfer funds between NAFIs within their same base.  The  AFSVA/FM  may  transfer  funds  between  bases/MAJCOMs  or  transfer  funds  from/to  the MAJCOM to their bases.   6.1.1.  Transferring  Funds between NAFIs within the Same  Base.  The NAF AO enters the dollar  amount,  the  accounting  string,  and  the  FROM/TO  CMIP  account  numbers  in electronic cash transfer form.  The entry generates a “TR” bank code, updates general ledger and flows directly to CMIP to transfer the funds between CMIP account numbers.  6.1.2.  Transferring Funds between Bases.  A NAF AO may request transfers from their base to  another  base  through  AFSVA/FMNTB.    The  base  may  request  the  form  by  email.  AFSVA/FMNTB enters the dollar amount, the accounting string, and the FROM/TO CMIP account numbers in AFSFMS.  The entry generates a funds transfer, updates general ledger and flows directly to CMIP and transfers the funds between the bases’ CMIP accounts.  The remitting base (not the receiving base) sends an e-mail transfer request to AFSVA/FMNTB with a copy to SSC using the following format: 6.1.2.1.  SUBJECT:  Dollar Transfer 6.1.2.2.  TRANSFER AMOUNT: 6.1.2.3.  TRANSFER FROM:  (CMIP Account Number) 6.1.2.4.  TRANSFER TO:  (Base and NAFI) 6.1.2.5.  TRANSFER DESCRIPTION:   6.1.2.6.  REMITTING BASE TRANSFER ACCOUNTING STRING:    6.1.2.7.  RECEIVING BASE TRANSFER ACCOUNTING STRING: 6.1.2.8.  AFSVA/FMNTB  will  manually  transfer  the  funds  between  CMIP  accounts  on the Date of Business requested.   6.2.  AFLF.  AFLFs withdraw and allocate funds to/from a base’s lodging fund. AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 21 Chapter 7 CMIP REMITTANCES 7.1.  General Information on Remittances.  Remittances are CMIP transactions between a base NAFI,  MAJCOM  NAFI,  Central  Fund  NAFI,  or  the  AFFMF.    Examples  of  remittances  are retirement  or  group  insurance  contributions,  insurance  payments,  loan  repayments,  DP validations,  assessments,  Automated  Clearing  House  (ACH)  debits/credits  posted  to  the  main concentration  bank  account,  check  and  deposit  corrections,  and  automated  reimbursement  for approved capital expenditure projects.  7.2.  Recording  Remittances.  Remittances  initiated  from  base-level  NAF  AOs,  MAJCOMs, SSC  or  AFSVA/FM  appears  in  the  remittance  column  of  paragraph  1  of  the  daily  CMIP Statement.  Paragraph 2 of the daily CMIP Statement provides a remittance description.  Upon receipt of the statement, SSC will increase or decrease General  Ledger Account  Code (GLAC) 1010000, Cash in Bank, as indicated, unless it has already been recorded in the general ledger.  If already  recorded, verify  that the amount and other details are correct.   Reverse accruals  before recording the actual remittance.  In some instances, do not record the DP validation remittance to GLAC 1010000. See Chapter 10.  7.3.  Remittance Processing.  The SSC Payroll is responsible for processing and calculating the following  expenses:  (1)  Group  Insurance,  (2)  Retirement,  (3)  Workers  Compensation  and Unemployment, (4) 401K Savings, (5) Payroll.  The file is processed and submitted to General Ledger.  General  Ledger  then  creates  the  CMIP  entry  to  charge  the  base  for  their  share  of  the expenses.  If an error is made in reporting remittances, do not attempt to make any corrections.  Notify SSC byMyPers Incident.  7.4.  Automated Reimbursements.  The Automated Reimbursement Account (ARA) module is designed to assist the flow of funds through CMIP for those projects or programs that receive AF support.  Each  base  has  a  designated  ARA  number  associated  with  the  project  type  (standard, capital improvement, and small projects).  Each ARA number is linked to the installation CMIP number  and  supporting  central  fund  CMIP  number.    Initiating  a  "CT"  transaction  with  the applicable  NAFI,  correct  ARA,  and  project  number  generates  reimbursement  on  the  DOB following the date of entry into the system.  Supporting documentation remains at the base-level NAF AO. 7.4.1.  AFSFMS automatically generates the CT for reimbursement when a vendor payment is processed, therefore both payment and reimbursement CTs should reflect the CMIP posted at the same time.  If an error occurs and a CT reimbursement rejects in the system, FMNTC researches  the  cause,  advises,  and  resolves  the  issue  through  a  manual  CT  reimbursement action. 7.4.2.  Automated  reimbursement  remittances  appear  in  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  the  daily CMIP  Statement.  SSC  will  record  and  reflect  appropriate  general  ledger  entries  in accordance with AFPCAFSVA/FM instructions and in coordination with the installation, see AFMAN  34-214,  Procedures  for  Non-appropriated  Funds  Financial  Management  and Accounting.     7.5    Property  and  Liability.  AFSVA/FM processes the  premiums  for asset and  liability  insurance  as  of  31  December,  31  March,  30  June,  and  30  September  of  each Fiscal  Year  (FY)  using  data  from  the  NAF  financial  statements.    The  assessments  create 22 AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 negative remittances which appear on the CMIP statement as a decrease to the NAFI CMIP balance. 7.5.  Aircraft  Hull  Insurance  Assessments.  Aero  clubs  report  aircraft  status  via  RCS:    HAF-SV (Q) 9495, Aero Club Operations Report.  AFSVA/FM uses information from the report and process  aircraft  hull  insurance  assessments  as  of  31  December,  31  March,  30  June,  and  30 September of each FY. 7.5.1.  Assessments are charged as a remittance to the CMIP account on or about the end of the  second  month  following  the  end  of  each  fiscal  quarter.    For  additional  information,  see AFMAN 34-214. 7.6.  Aircraft  Liability  Insurance  Assessments.  AFSVA/FM  also  calculates  and  processes aircraft liability assessments as described in paragraph 7.5. 7.7.  Temporary  Lodging  Facility  (TLF))  Assessment.  Base  TLF  assessments  on  occupied units.  See AFMAN 34-214, for assessment computation instructions.  At End of Month (EoM), SSC automatically receives the assessment file from Defense Logding System (DLS).  SSC will process and post a CT GLAF to AFSFMS and CMIP.  Bases not on automated computation  will email the GLAC 111 Lodging Daily Reconciliation spreadsheet by the 15th of each month to the SSC.  SSC will create the CT GLAF to post assessments to general ledger and CMIP. 7.8.  Reimbursable  TLF  Purchase.  For new TLF construction, the AFLF reimburses the base for the initial furniture and equipment purchase. (See AFMAN 34-214). AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 23 Chapter 8 REPORTING CMIP TRANSACTIONS 8.1.  General  Information  on  Reporting.  The  SSC  transmits  CMIP  banking  transactions  to FMNTB  six  times  weekly,  Sunday  through  Friday  except  for  holidays  and  other  non-business days. 8.2.  Timing of Transmissions.  Transmit CMIP files No Earlier Than (NET) 0800 CST and No Later than (NLT) 2300 CST on the first business day after DOB being reported.   8.3.  Transmissions Not Received by AFSVA/FMNTB.  When reviewing the CMIP statement, if  a  day's  transmission  is  not  updated,  immediately  contact  AFSVA/FMNTB  for  further instructions.  8.4.  Dating of Transactions.  The DOB is the day the sale was made, the check was dated, the transfer was made, etc.  For deposits, the DOB is the date of the cashier's report.  All transactions to  cash  made  or  to  be  made  in  the  general  ledger  for  a  given  date  are  reported  to  CMIP.   Saturday's and Sunday's transactions are reported on Monday using Saturday and Sunday DOBs.  When  a  month  ends  on  a  weekend,  follow  reporting  instructions  in  paragraph  9.5.    When  a holiday  falls  on  a  week  day,  follow  reporting  instructions  in  paragraph  9.6.    Activities  with authorized  waivers  from  daily  bank  deposits,  use  the  DOB  the  deposits  were  made  when reporting  transactions.    The  activity  must  make  a  deposit  at  the  close  of  business,  the  last business day of each month; regardless of dollar amount (see AFI 34-202, Protection of Assets).   8.5.  End-of-Month  Reporting.  When  the  last  day  of  the  month  falls  on  a  weekend  follow procedures as outlined below in paragraph 9.5.1 and 9.5.2.  8.5.1.  When  EOM  falls  on  Saturday.    Transmit  Friday's  and  Saturday's  DOB  on  Monday using Friday and Saturday  DOBs.  For CMIP purposes the EOM transactions  are dated the last day of month.  8.5.2.  When  EOM  falls  on  Sunday.    Transmit  Friday's,  Saturday's,  and  Sunday's  DOB  on Monday  using  Friday,  Saturday,  and  Sunday  DOBs.    For  CMIP  purposes  the  EOM transactions are dated the last day of month. 8.5.3.  Holiday  Reporting  Procedures  for  CMIP  Transactions.    When  a  holiday  falls  on  a weekday, report deposits  and cash transfer the following business  day using the transaction DOB.  8.6.  CMIP  Statements.  The  procedures  in  paragraphs  9.5.1.  and  9.5.2.  will  prevent adjustments  to  GLAC  7920001  if  multiple  DOBs  are  combined  into  one.    The  end-of-month GLAC 1010000 balances and financial statements will still match with the CMIP Statements. 8.7.  Banking  Files.  The  SSC  receives  all  banking  transactions  from  base  level  daily.    The banking file updates the CMIP and other related systems.  8.8.  AFFMF  Contact.  When  contacting  AFFMF  concerning  CMIP,  please  use  the  following address or email: 8.8.1.  Mailing Address:  AFSVA/FMNTB, 2261 Hughes Avenue, Suite 156, Lackland AFB, TX 78236. 24 AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 8.8.2.  Use DSN 969-7436/7461/7462/7463 to inquire about: 8.8.2.1.

Deposit  Validations.  The  purpose  of  a  deposit  validation  is  to  ensure  that  all  deposits, debit and credit memos, and adjustments reported and accepted by AFSVA/FMNTB agree with those  posted  by  the  field  bank  for  the  same  period  of  time.    Upon  receipt  of  the  field  bank statement,  AFSVA/FMNTB  compares  the  deposits,  debit  and  credit  memos,  and  adjustments reported at base level to the entries posted on the field bank statement.  Any differences become a net  deposit  validation variance, which AFSVA/FMNTB will post to  the depositing location’s account.    The  deposit  validation  variances  will  appear  on  the  depositing  locations  CMIP statement  in  the  “Remit”  column  in  paragraph  1  and  also  in  paragraph  2  as  a  line  item  detail entry with the description, “DP VAL” and date. 9.2.  Explanation  of  DP  Validation  Products  and  Their  Use.  AFSVA/FMNTB  assembles  a deposit validation package for each bank account and emails the NAF Liaison Org Box and SSC.  This package contains the following documents: 9.2.1.  Bank versus Base Variance Report.  See  Attachment 2 for an explanation of the data which appears on the report. 9.2.2.  Deposit Validation and Recon Process.  The AFSVA/FMNTB Cash Subsidiary (Cash Sub) report recaps all deposits reported at base level from the first DOB to the last DOB for the month.  Any discrepancies between Cash Sub and the bank statement are reported on the bank  deposit  validation  report.    The  supporting  documentation  (bank  statements,  cash  sub report) shows the individual transactions which make up the totals on the cover sheet of the bank deposit validation report. Deposits reported on the last day of the month not posted by the bank until the following month are carried in-transit for the next month’s reconciliation. 9.2.3.  Probable  Variance.    If  there  is  a  difference  in  the  ending  total  (line  5)  on  the  Bank Versus Base Variance Report, AFSVA/FMNTB researches the difference and makes a list of the  items  creating  the  variance.    Upon  receipt  of  the  DP  validation  package,  the  NAF  AO reviews the list created by AFSVA/FMNTB and takes appropriate action.  The following are common entries that create a variance and the actions necessary to correct the variance. 9.2.3.1.  A base reports an entry in one month and the bank posts the entry in a different month, a variance occurs.  For example:  A base reported a deposit on 28 September but the  bank  did  not  post  the  deposit  to  the  bank  statement  until  1  October.    The  deposit becomes  a  negative  variance  in  September  as  a  deposit  reported  by  the  base  and  not posted by the bank.  In October, the bank posts the deposit and creates a positive variance as  a  deposit  posted  by  the  bank  and  not  reported  by  the  base.    These  entries  are  called "wash"  items.    For  this  variance,  no  corrective  action  is  needed.    However,  the  SSC annotates  the  September  variance  on  AF  Form  1736,  NAF  Cash  Management  and Investment  Program  Account  Verification,  until  cleared  the  following  month.    Wash items  should  never  appear  on  AF  Form  1736,  NAF  Cash  Management  and  Investment Program Account Verification, for more than one month.  If research shows a bank error and additional month may pass before the bank makes the correction, the base should set up  either  a  payable  or  receivable  while  research  is  being  conducted.    Debit  and  credit memos can also be wash items. 26 AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 9.2.3.2.  A  deposit  posted  by  the  bank  in  an  amount  different  than  the  base  reported causes a deposit  validation variance.   If the difference  applies to  a NAFI other than the MWRF,  the  NAF  AO  notifies  the  SSC  for  Fund  transfer  processing.    This  will  move (increase or decrease, as applicable) the variance from the MWRF of the NAFI affected.  If no prior entry has been made, the SSC processes a General  Ledger Adjustment Form (GLAF) to update the general ledger cash-in-bank account for the proper NAFI.  Follow the same procedures for debit and credit memo variances.  If AFSVA/FMNTB research indicates a bank error, it becomes a wash item.  The NAF AO shows the field bank the documentation  (validated  deposit  ticket,  copy  of  the  bank  debt  or  credit  memo)  and requests  a  correction.  When  the  bank  makes  the  correction,  it  is  a  part  of  that  month’s variance and reverses the original variance.  (Fund Transfer eliminates extra transactions. If Funds Transfer is not processed, SSC will record initial CMIP posting to MWRF.  The base should not submit another electronic cash transfer which creates more transactions.   9.2.3.3.  If the bank posts a deposit  and research shows it is a valid deposit that has not been reported, follow the instructions outlined in paragraph 9.2.3.2. 9.3.  FC  Deposit  Validation  (Overseas  Only).  Foreign  currency  deposit  validations  are performed in the local currency using the same procedures as outlined in 9.1 and 9.2 above.  A foreign  currency  deposit  validation  variance  is  posted  to  CMIP  in  US  dollars  using  the  local currency exchange rate for the DOB the variance is posted to CMIP. 9.4.  Deposit  Validation  Reconciliation.  SSC  reviews  and  coordinates  the  deposit  validation variances with the depositing NAFI and enters a GLAF to update the depositing NAFI’s general ledger, or submits Fund Transfer, if necessary.  9.5.  Transfer  between  NAFIs.  If  a  line  item  variance  appearing  on  the  deposit  validation belongs to another NAFI (for example, Lodging), follow 9.2.4.2. AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 27 Chapter 10 RECONCILIATION OF CMIP ACCOUNTS 10.1.  Cash  Control  Summary  Report.  A Cash Control Summary (CCS) report is maintained as  described  in  AFMAN  34-214.    The  SSC  uses  an  automated  CCS  in  AFSFMS  for  daily reconciliations  of  the  CMIP  balances  and  the  General  Ledger  cash  accounts.    When  the  daily CMIP  message  is  released,  AFSFMS  extracts  the  CMIP  information  and  populates  the  CCS report.  10.2.  End-of-Month  Products.  The  following  products  are  generated  at  end  of  month  and distributed by AFSVA/FMNTB as follows:  10.2.1.  Outstanding  Check  Reports.    Reports  for  general  and  foreign  currency  checks  are produced separately.  All checks that have not been paid or processed as paid by the CMIP system and as of the last business day of a given month, are listed in numerical order on the monthly  Outstanding  Check  Report.    Monthly,  AFSVA/FMNTB  reviews  the  outstanding check report to ensure which checks must be voided via AFSFMS.  FMNTB will coordinate with SSC, SVX and FM to void via AFSFMS and banking system.  .   10.3.  Verification  of  Outstanding  Check  Reports.  AFSVA/FMNTB  takes  corrective  action.  Checks will be voided after 120 days if all attempts to contact the payee have been unsuccessful.  It is not necessary to place a stop payment on the checks written-off unless a replacement check is to be issued.  AFSVA/FMNTB sends a report of Outstanding Checks to FM, SSC, and Bases monthly.  At the expiration date of the check the SSC will send an email to  the bases with  the outstanding check numbers and payees to see if the SSC needs to repay the check to the payee or void  the  check.  Once  the  information  is  received  from  the  bases,SSC  will  contact  FMNTB.  Once the checks are voided in AFSFMS they will send the banking an email confirming which checks were voided and AFSVA/FMNTB will ensure posting to CMIP has been accomplished.   10.4.  End-of-Month  CMIP  Account  Verification.  SSC  must  reconcile  each  NAFI  CMIP account at end of month.  Use AF Form 1736, to certify CMIP balances reconciled with General Ledger and Cash Control Summary report.  Provide justification for any reconciling items.  If CT GLAF  is  required,  annotate  the  transaction  date  entered  into  the  General  Ledger  and  the  date correction will post to CMIP.   10.5.  Adjustments  of  CMIP  Accounts  Due  to  Unreconciled  Variances.  While  the  SSC reconciles  the  CMIP  accounts  to  the  General  Ledger  daily,  variances  can  occur  that  cannot  be identified.  When an unidentified variance occurs, the SSC will take appropriate action to resolve the  variance  in  coordination  with  AFSVA/FMNTB  and  other  branches  affected.  SSC  will identify the discrepancy and will process a GLAF, Funds Transfer, DP, or OT action.   28 AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 Chapter 11 SEVERANCE ACCOUNTS 11.1.  Programs.  The SEV program is another pooling of resources concept.  SEV accounts are similar  to  CMIP  accounts.    Although  participation  in  SEV  programs  is  entirely  separate  from CMIP  participation,  nearly  all  SEV  deposits  and  withdrawals  are  made  from  and  to  CMIP accounts.  11.2.  SEV  Participation.  SEV  participation  is  mandatory  for  overseas  bases  which  employ foreign  nationals  if  there  is  a  severance  liability.    AFSVA/SV  may  also  request  that  SEV participation be established for CONUS  bases as  a part of base closure proceedings.  The base will email request the accounts by message to AFSVA/FMNTB.   11.3.  Account Numbers.  SEV account numbers are the same as those used for CMIP. 11.4.  Statements.  AFSVA/FMNTB  sends  the  SSC  and  NAF  AO  SEV  statements  at  EOM  by message.  . 11.5.  End-of-Month Products.  AFSVA/FMNTB includes a SEV Recap Summary in the EOM message  sent  to  each  NAF  AO  and  SSC.    These  summaries  are  further  breakdowns  of  the monthly activity by NAFI, DOB, and type of transaction. 11.6.  Payment of Interest.  The AFFMF calculates and pays interest on SEV accounts monthly in the same manner and at the same rate as used for the CMIP (see paragraph 3.3.).  The interest earned for the prior month is posted to the SEV accounts on the first business day of the current month. 11.7.  Deposits.  CMIP participants who wish to deposit funds into a SEV account must send an e-mail to AFSVA/FMNTB  requesting funds be transferred from CMIP to SEV.  The email is to include, the dollar amount to be transferred, the NAFI the funds are to be transferred from, the DOB of the transfer and the accounting string.   11.8.  Withdrawals.  To withdraw funds from a SEV account send an e-mail request as outlined in 11.7 above.   11.9.  Minimum  Balances,  SEV  Accounts.  The  balances  of  SEV  accounts  are  periodically reviewed by AFSVA/FMNTB and all remaining balances of less than $10.00 are withdrawn and moved to the CMIP account. 11.10.  MAJCOM  Contributions.  MAJCOMs  who  want  to  share  in  the  funding  of  a  NAFI's severance liability may do so as outlined in 11.7. above.   AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 29 Chapter 12 DATA REPORTING AND SUBMISSION SYSTEM 12.1.  Data  Systems.  CMIP  is  created  from  daily  reporting  from  the  Bases,  SSC  and AFSVA/FM.    These  transactions  are  provided  from  input  from  an  interface  between Consolidated  Activity  Cashier’s  Reports  (AF  Form  1876)  and  Total  Cash  Deposit’s  (AF  Form 1877) (DLS, LTS, ALOHA, QUBICA, AFSFMS).        12.1.1.  All bases input their data and submit to AFSFMS.  A file is created within ORACLE and creates CMIP.  12.1.2.  The information is compiled by NAFI/CMIP account into one file.  This file is then pulled  the  very  next  business  day  and  processed  through  to  AFSVA/FMNTB  for  deposits, Check Issues, CT’s, and all Cash Transfers using CMIP Program. 12.1.3.  The  resultant  file  is  then  split  up  by  base  name  and  CMIP  number,  with  CMIP Message being distributed to the bases via email. 12.2.  Files Do Not Transmit. 12.2.1.  Create MyPers Incident and contact SSC for further assistance. 12.2.2.  Re-submit AF Form 1876 and AF 1877 via AFSFMS. 30 AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 Chapter 13 OPERATIONS UNDER EMERGENCY CONDITIONS 13.1.  Emergency  Notifications.  The  Resource  Manager  shall  notify the  AFSVA/CC, AFSVA/FM,  and  AFSVA/SVT,  by  the  most  expedient  means,  of  the  nature  of  the  emergency conditions.    The  AFSVA/FM  shall  designate  a  support  accounting  office  (and  notify AFSVA/FM,  AFSVA/SVI  and  AFSVA/SSC)  to  ensure  the  survival  and  recovery  of  essential data files, the capability to provide essential support during the emergency conditions, and the re-establishment of operations.   13.2.  Disposition  of  Currency  and  Coin.  If  conditions  require  evacuation,  disposal  or destruction  of  currencies  or  coins,  or  emergency  turn-in  of  funds,  overseas  field  commanders shall follow procedures  as specified in  AFI 10-213, Comptroller Operations Under Emergency Conditions.  Transfer US  currency  and  coins  to  the nearest  disbursing officer in  exchange  for  a check drawn on US Treasury or to be held in protective custody using a safekeeping receipt.  The check  is  to  be  made  payable  to  the  Air  Force  Financial  Management  Fund  and  sent  to AFSVA/FM for deposit; a brief explanation of the nature of the emergency will accompany the check.  However, disbursing officers will not be held accountable should the local currencies or coins be lost or destroyed as a result of the existing emergency.   13.3.  Blank  Check  Stocks.  If conditions require evacuation, destroy blank check stocks using DD Form 2661, Spoiled/Canceled Check Record, as the inventory list.  Send the completed DD Form 2661 (original) attesting to the destruction of the checks to AFPC/FMNTB.    GINA M.

Section labeled Bank Statement: A2.1.1.  Line 1 shows total of deposits and credits posted by the field bank, current month. A2.1.2.  Line 2 shows total debit memos (this includes returned checks) posted by the field bank, current month, except for the last day's debit memos.  NOTE:  If the field bank posts any  debit  memos  on  the  last  business  day  of  the  month  (last  2  business  days  for  overseas bases) and AFSVA/FMNTB cannot identify that they have been reported, these debit memos are carried forward to be included with the debit memos on line 2 in the following month. A2.1.3.  Line 3 allows space to record any bank adjustments or corrections. A2.1.4.  Line  4  is  the  net  total  of  deposits  and  other  bank  credits,  less  debit  memos  and dishonored  checks  posted  by  the  bank  and  considered  in  the  current  reconciliation,  plus  or minus any bank adjustments on line 3. A2.2.  Section labeled Base Reported: A2.2.1.  Line  1  shows  the  total  (adjusted,  if  necessary,  to  account  for  in  transit  items) deposits reported and accepted as shown on the monthly deposit report. A2.2.2.  Line  2  shows  the  total  (adjusted,  if  necessary,  to  account  for  in  transit  items) dishonored  checks  and  bank  debit  memos  reported  and  accepted  as  shown  on  the  monthly deposit report. A2.2.3.  Line 3 is for any AFSVA/FMNTB adjustments (if applicable) requested by the base during the month. A2.2.4.  Line 4 is the net total of deposits, less debit memos and dishonored checks, reported and accepted, plus or minus any adjustments on line 3. A2.3.  Net Variance.  The net variance is the difference between what the bank posted and what the base reported. If the amount on line 4 of the Base Reported section (i.e., Total Net Deposits Accepted)  is  greater  than  the  amount  on  line  4  of  the  Bank  Statement  section  (i.e.,  Total  Net Deposits Posted to Your Bank Statement), the net result is a negative variance.  However, if the amount on line 4 of the Bank Statement section is greater than the amount on line 4 of the Base Reported section, the net result is a positive variance.  AFMAN 34-215  9 FEBRUARY 2016 35 EXPLANATION OF DATA TO BE REPORTED ON AF FORM 1736 Attachment 3 A3.1.
