Responsibilities 2.17.1.  AFPC/DP2N  (Corps  Utilization  &  Education)  will  prepare  annually  a  staffing analysis for each primary AFSC in support of the HPERB process.  This analysis will contain gains from training and recruiting; and anticipated losses from retirements, separations, and training.    (Note:    Generally,  the  staffing  analysis  begins  with  the  current  year  data  and extends  into  future  fiscal  years  to  at  least  the  impact  year  [year  the  trainee  re-enters workforce after completing training] unless otherwise specified by AF/SG1/8). 2.17.2.  The  initial  AFPC/DP2N  review  is  done  by  the  Utilization  and  Education  Branch Chiefs for each Corps to validate the training requirement relative to projected vacant billets that require education and training. 2.17.3.  AFMS  Corps  Directors,  in  conjunction  with  their  respective  Corps  Chiefs,  will review,  validate  and  prioritize  training  requests  establishing  a  Corps  training  requirements list.    The  Corps  Director  will  meet  with  the  Force  Development  Panel  Chair  and  Program Element  Manager  (PEM)  to  review  requirements  and  risk.    Corp  Directors  will  brief AF/SG1/8  on  the  validated  requirements.    AF/SG1/8  reviews,  approves  or  disapproves validated HPERB requirements. 2.17.4.  Force Development Panel will conduct an audit after completion of Corps DTs.  The audit  will  consist  of  a  line-by-line  comparison  of  requirements  to  selections.    If  there  is  a discrepancy the Corps will need to apply for a waiver and re-evaluate requirements.  The data gathered  will  assist  with  determining  if  other  approaches  should  be  employed  to  fill requirements (i.e. recruiting fully qualified candidates). 2.18.  Skill Progression Training. 2.18.1.  Includes GME, GDE, AFIT graduate education, Education with Industry (EWI), and in-house  fellowships  to  include  both  clinical  and  non-clinical.    All  training  is  approved through the HPERB process. 2.19.  Selection Boards 2.19.1.  AFPC/DP2N  (Corps  Utilization  &  Education)  will,  upon  approval  of  HPERB training  requirements  by  AF/SG1/8,  send  out  approved  allocations  and  eligibility  via Personnel  Services  Delivery  Memorandum  (PSDM).    In  addition,  AFPC/DP2N  will  assist Corps  with  their  HPERB  selection  board,  Developmental  Team  (DT);  process  will  ensure only valid requirements are matched. 2.20.

Additionally,  if  the  training  program  utilizes  a  civilian institution, proposed changes will be coordinated with AFIT Healthcare Education Division prior to submission to AF/SG1/8. 2.20.2.  Out-of-Cycle  New  Training  Requirement:    If  a  critical  training  requirement  is identified after the HPERB process cycle, the individual identifying the training requirement submits a request for training through the appropriate Corps representative at AFPC/DP2N.  Requests will include the following: 1) reason training was not requested in HPERB process; 2) projected manning in the specialty for which the training is requested; 3) impact if training is delayed for a year; and 4) request for realignment or addition of training man-years. 2.20.3.  The  appropriate  Corps  representative  at  AFPC/DP2N  validates  projected  manning requirements, coordinates the request with AFIT/HCED if the training requested is managed by AFIT/HCED, and forwards the request to USAF/SG1.  Each level of review/coordination includes  a  recommendation  for  approval/disapproval.    Training  being  considered  for approval is added to the previous approved list and re-prioritized by the executive committee of the HPERB. The executive committee consists of the Corps Directors, Force Development Panel  Chair and PEM, AF/SG1/8.  The revised  approved list  is  forwarded to  AF/SG1/8 for final action. 2.21.

The AF facility DME should ensure that the  consortium’s  due  process  procedures  are  comparable  to  this  instruction;  the  Regional Medical  Law  Consultant  can  provide  advice  or  review  documents  if  needed.    The  PD  or DME  can  often  improve  student  performance  before  it  becomes  necessary  to  extend  or terminate training. 3.2.1.1.  Counsel and otherwise help students to overcome any deficiencies. 3.2.1.2.  DMEs and PDs will document any discretionary actions taken before going on to more serious actions that could extend or terminate training.  (T-1). 3.2.1.3.  DMEs  and  PDs  will  discuss  such  discretionary  actions  with  the  student  and document the actions in the student’s education record.  (T-1). 3.2.1.4.  The PD will inform the DME and, if necessary, the GMEC, of your discretionary actions.  (T-1) 3.2.2.  Types of Discretionary Actions. 3.2.2.1.  Limitations.    Limitations  refer  to  conditions  that  you  place  on  a  student’s educational activities that restrict the types of activities in which a student can participate.  The PD determines what type of limitations may be placed on a student. 3.2.2.2.  Academic  Notice.    The  PD  may  place  students  with  academic,  performance  or other deficiencies on academic notice.  Give such notice in writing, including the reason for and the terms and duration of the notice.  Outline the actions required by the student to correct the problem.  Indicate to the student the potential consequences if the problems are  not  corrected.    Academic  notice  is  not  considered  a  reportable  action  for  future credentialing/ licensing. 3.2.2.3.  Formal Probation.  Place students on probationary status on the recommendation of  the  GMEC  or  its  subcommittee.    The  purpose  of  probation  is  to  impress  upon  the students  the seriousness  of their deficiencies and to  give the students  the opportunity to correct those deficiencies.  Probation that has been approved by the GMEC is considered 24 AFI41-117  25 MARCH 2015 a reportable action on the student’s final training report and the physician must report it on all credentialing and state licensure documents the remainder of their medical career.  (T-0) 3.2.2.3.1.  PD  will  give  students  written  notice  of  probation,  specifying  why  the probation  was  imposed  and  how  long  it  will  last.    (T-1).    Suggest  specific  ways  to overcome the problem.  Develop a written remediation plan.  The appropriate office at AFPC/DPAN is provided a copy of all formal probation documentation. 3.2.2.3.2.  The  DME  may  remove  probationary  status  with  the  concurrence  of  the GMEC or its appropriate subcommittee. 3.2.2.4.  Other.    Take  any  other  actions  necessary  that  affect  but  are  not  reasonably expected to delay or terminate the student’s education program. 3.3.  Administrative or Judicial Action. 3.3.1.  When  beginning  and  completing  administrative  or  judicial  action  against  a  student (e.g., AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures,  or the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)), the Commander will notify AFPC/DPAN.  (T-1)  (For ARC, see:  AFI 36-3209, Separation and Retirement Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Members).  The DME will review the case to determine whether to also restrict, suspend, or terminate the student’s education status until review by the GMEC.  (T-1) 3.4.  Students in Civilian Programs. 3.4.1.  Send  any  recommendations  to  remove  the  education  status  of  students  in  civilian programs through AFIT Healthcare Education Division to AFPC/DPAN. 3.4.2.  Affiliated  Programs.  For  programs  that  are  closely  affiliated  with  civilian  programs (for  example,  USAF  Medical  Center  Wright-Patterson),  the  due  process  procedures  of  the ACGME recognized program  or institution should be followed.  The military facility DME should ensure that the sponsoring institutions due process procedures are comparable to this instruction;  the  Regional  Medical  Law  Consultant  can  provide  advice  or  review  the documents if needed. 3.4.3.  A military resident being separated from the military will also be terminated from the civilian  program.    Students  terminated  from  civilian  training  would  continue  to  serve  out their military ADSC in a position commensurate with current/valid credentials. 3.5.  Documentation. 3.5.1.  The DME will keep records of all requirements and actions under this section in  the student’s education record.  (T-1) 3.6.  USAFSAM  . 3.6.1.  Restrict,  suspend,  or  terminate  students  enrolled  in  these  courses  according  to  the directives of the USAFSAM. 3.7.  Processing for Individual Request. 3.7.1.  The  process  below  applies  to  students  enrolled  in  USAF  education  programs.  Students  in  programs  outside  the  USAF  follow  similar  procedures  through  the    AFIT Healthcare Education Division. AFI41-117  25 MARCH 2015 25 3.7.1.1.  Student  Request.    Students  send  a  written  request  to  the  PD  for  permission  to resign from a program. 3.7.1.2.  Request  Approval.    The  program  director  endorses  and  forwards  the  request  to the DME. The PD: 3.7.1.3.  Recommends approval or disapproval of the request. 3.7.1.4.  Recommends an effective date of resignation. 3.7.1.5.  Outlines  why  the  student  is  requesting  resignation  and  whether  the  student’s progress up to that time is satisfactory. 3.7.1.6.  Indicates how much completion credit the student has earned. 3.7.1.7.  Recommends, at his/her discretion, the student for future education in the same specialty or a different specialty. 3.7.1.8.  Gives  an  information  copy  of  this  endorsement  to  the  student,  and  receives acknowledgment of its receipt from the student. 3.7.1.9.  Identifies  whether  the  student  is  able  to  provide  independent  care  as  a  general medical officer or flight surgeon. 3.8.  Review.  The GMEC reviews the case, recommends approval or disapproval, and forwards it to through the DME to the MTF/CC. 3.9.  Commander Review. 3.9.1.  The  MTF/CC  either  disapproves  the  request  or  sends  it  with  a  recommendation  for approval to AFPC/DPAN (with a copy to the student’s MAJCOM). 3.10.  Final Approval. 3.10.1.  Resignation becomes effective when AFPC/DPAN approves it. 3.11.  Consequences of Resignation  . 3.11.1.  Students  who  resign  from  programs  required  for  professional  practice  in  the  USAF (e.g.  first  post  graduate  year  (PGY-1)  residents  who  resign  prior  to  meeting  licensing requirements) may be involuntarily separated or may have to perform service in an alternate career  field.    Physicians  at  PGY-2  or  above  whose  resignation  is  approved  or  who  are terminated  from  their  program  will  be  referred  to  Physician  Utilization  Branch  for assignment    (T-1).    Due  to  the  complexities  associated  with  resignation,  training  programs should  contact  the  appropriate  branch  of  AFPC/DPAN  to  best  inform  the  trainee  of  the potential impact of resigning from training. 3.12.  Immediate Restriction or Suspension  . 3.12.1.  If a student’s conduct or performance requires immediate action to protect the health or safety of any patient, employee, or other person in the medical facility, the PD, DME, or higher authority may summarily restrict or suspend the student’s patient care activities.  If the summary action leads to delays or termination of the education program, promptly notify the DME  in  writing.  The  local  Staff  Judge  Advocate  will  be  consulted  if  there  are  any questions/concerns with the actions.  26 AFI41-117  25 MARCH 2015 3.13.  Routine Actions. 3.13.1.  If counseling or other discretionary actions (see paragraph 3.2, of this instruction) do not resolve an academic, disciplinary, or other problems, notify the PD, DME, and GMEC. 3.14.  Committee Actions. 3.14.1.  The  GMEC  or  its  appropriate  subcommittee  reviews  the  case  and  sends  its recommendations to AFPC/DPAN through the DME. 3.14.1.1.  Action to Extend or Terminate Training. 3.14.1.2.  Student Notification.  The DME reviews with the committee recommendation. Any  concerns  with  the  proposal  resolved  before  student  is  notified.    If  the  DME  non-concurs  with  the  recommendation,  the  DME  with  meet  with  GMEC  for  further resolution.  If the DME concurs with the recommendation, the DME notifies the student. (Attachment 3). 3.14.1.3.  Review Option.  Students who receive notice of recommendation for extension or  termination  of  their  education  program  may  request  a  faculty  board  review  of  the recommendation. 3.14.1.3.1.  Students  send  written  requests  for  such  reviews  to  the  DME  within  ten calendar days of receiving the recommendation notice.  Extensions may be granted by the DME for compelling reasons. 3.14.1.3.2.  If  the  student  fails  to  request  his/her  review  within  the  time  allowed,  or fails to appear at the scheduled faculty board, the student waives the right to a faculty board review and all rights associated with the faculty board. 3.14.1.3.3.  Commander  Notification.    If  the  student  does  not  request  or  otherwise waives the review, the DME sends the notice of recommended action to the MTF/CC for review and decision. 3.14.1.4.  Commander Action. 3.14.1.4.1.  If  the  commander  disagrees  with  the  committee  recommendation  (see paragraphs  3.14  of  this  instruction),  he  or  she  returns  the  matter  to  the  GMEC  for further consideration and action according to this instruction. 3.14.1.4.2.  If the commander agrees with the recommendation, he or she forwards it to AFPC/DPAN for final approval. 3.15.  Impartiality of Reviewers. 3.15.1.  Only  personnel  who  are  able  to  make  a  fair  review  of  the  case  are  eligible  to  be student  faculty  board  members  and  reviewers.    Personal  acquaintances  of  the  student  may serve  as  board  members  or  reviewers  if  they  are  able  to  meet  this  requirement.    Certain personnel  cannot  serve  on  faculty  boards  or  as  a  reviewing  authority  for  board recommendations about a particular student: 3.15.2.  A  person  such  as  the  DME,  PD,  or  MTF/CC  who  has  taken  summary  action according to paragraph 3.13, of this instruction. 3.15.3.

A  person  whose  statements  or  recommendations  have  played  a  significant  part  in initiating the action against the student. 3.16.  Faculty Board Composition and Procedures. 3.16.1.  The  purpose  of  a  faculty  board  is  to  review  the  student’s  academic  performance, professionalism,  disciplinary  actions  and/or  patient  care  issues  and  determine  if  there  are grounds to support the extension or termination decision.  The faculty board also affords the student the opportunity to speak on his/her own behalf.  See 3.16.2.5 for additional details. 3.16.2.  Faculty  Board  Composition.    The  MTF/CC  must  appoint  in  writing  three  qualified officers, who are knowledgeable about the program’s academic content, to serve as members. The faculty board must contain three members who are knowledgeable about the program’s academic content.  (T-1). 3.16.3.  Faculty  Board  Procedures.    These  proceedings  are  not  bound  by  formal  rules  of evidence nor a strict procedural format. The preponderance of the evidence is the standard of proof  to  be  used  in  arriving  at  determinations  in  boards  conducted  under  this  section.    A preponderance  of  evidence  is  that  evidence  which,  when  fairly  considered,  produces  the stronger  impression,  has  the  greater  weight,  and  is  more  convincing  as  to  its  truth  when weighed against any evidence in opposition to it. 3.16.3.1.  AFI 51-602, Boards of Officers, does not apply to a Faculty Board 3.16.3.2.  Unless  the  commander  designates  another  person,  the  senior  member  of  the faculty board serves as chairperson. 3.16.3.3.

USAF needs determine the type and numbers of specialty selections in compliance with current HPERB standards.  PDs are selected by the  Dental  Executive  Board  and  must  at  minimum,  meet  specialty  board  certification requirements as stated in applicable CODA standards.  (T-0) 4.14.4.3.  AFIT sponsored programs provide training not available at USAF installations or if the USAF needs exceed USAF capabilities.  Students may earn a master’s degree, if available, provided they could finish formal course work without extending the length of the residency program. 4.14.4.4.  AFIT must concur on the request to ensure funding support and once approved, the student will be required to complete the approved elective degree.  (T-1).  Failure to complete the approved degree may result in a “non-completion” on the training report. 4.14.5.  Special Duties and Responsibilities of Senior Residents.  Senior residents are in their final  year of training.  They  report directly to the service or section  chief and  also  perform special  staff  duties.    They  assume  increased  responsibility,  both  in  treating  patients  and instructing and supervising other residents and postgraduate students.  The service or section chiefs  give  them  opportunities  to  work  with,  organize,  and  administer  other  services  or sections. 4.15.  Medical Service Corps (MSC) Education Programs. 4.15.1.  Master’s  Degree  Programs.    The  USAF  sponsors  selected  MSC  officers  to  obtain master’s  degrees  in  programs  such  as  hospital  or  health  care  administration,  business administration,  and  information  resource  management  when  USAF  requirements  exist.  Some  hospital  and  health  administration  programs  require  officers  to  serve  a  residency  to fulfill degree requirements.  MSC officers may serve in a military or civilian residency.  The preceptor, or duly  appointed co-preceptor, should have completed a similar course of study and have a master’s degree in the field of hospital or health administration and/or equivalent level of experience.  Programs are offered at Army, Navy, USUHS, or civilian institutions. 4.15.2.  Doctoral Programs.  Doctoral programs are available for MSC officers when specific needs for particular specialists exist.  Education is accomplished at civilian institutions. AFI41-117  25 MARCH 2015 37 4.15.3.

MSC  officers  sponsored  by  the  USAF  may  attend  only  those programs  and  institutions  that  are  fully  accredited  by  the  appropriate  national  professional accrediting body. 4.15.4.  Education with Industry (EWI).  A ten-month, non-degree program is available for a very small number of MSC officers.  Leading companies in the health care industry provide the education.  The USAF places the officer with a participating industry in an internship role to  learn  its  management  and  organizational  strategies  and  techniques  and  to  develop knowledge and skills that enhance AFMS health care administration.  AFPC/DPAN solicits applications annually. 4.15.5.  Senior  Health  Policy  Fellowship.    These  ten  month  non-degree  programs  prepare MSC  officers  for  future  specialized  or  staff  assignments  in  areas  such  as  medical  materiel, health facilities, financial management, planning, or computer science. AFPC/DPAN solicits applications annually. 4.15.6.  MSC Internships/Fellowships.  These are ten to twelve month programs conducted at selected USAF facilities.  The internships provide transitional experiences for MSCs entering active duty; fellowships expand the knowledge of experienced MSCs. 4.16.  Biomedical Sciences Corps (BSC) Education Programs. 4.16.1.  Graduate  Programs.    Programs  in  the  various  BSC  disciplines  are  available  at  the master’s,  doctoral,  and  fellowship  levels  at  civilian  institutions,  USAF  facilities,  Army medical  centers,  USUHS,  and  other  governmental  agencies  (e.g.,    Centers  for  Disease Control  and  Prevention).    These  programs  prepare  officers  for  positions  that  require advanced education or training. 4.16.2.  EWI.  The AFMS conducts  these 10-month, non-degree programs for BSC officers with  civilian  industry  or  with  another  Federal  agency.    The  objective  of  this  program  is  to prepare officers for positions requiring improved managerial qualities, technical competence, and  a  greater  understanding  of  management  common  to  industry  and  its  government counterparts.    Programs  exist  in  specialties  such  as  environmental  engineering,  industrial hygiene, and occupational health. 4.16.3.  Internship.    The  USAF  offers  internships  at  selected  AFMS  MTFs  in  clinical psychology.    PDs  must  at  a  minimum  be  board  eligible  in  their  specialty.    (T-1)    Board certification is preferred. 4.16.3.1.  The clinical psychology internship is a one-year program conducted at selected USAF medical centers.  This pre-doctoral program is a mandatory requirement for award of the doctorate in clinical psychology leading to licensure and independent practice.  It is focused toward enriching the student’s basic background in  psychology  and broadening understanding  of  human  behavior  through  extensive  clinical  experience  under  the supervision of the psychology staff.

Doctoral  programs  are  available  in  various  nursing  specialties  as  NC  requirements  dictate.  See  ETCA  and  the  AFPC/DPAN  Education  Selection  Board  announcement  letter  for eligibility and application procedures. 4.17.2.  Nurse  Transition  Program  (NTP).    This  program  prepares  ROTC/newly  accessed graduates and enlisted commissioning program candidates who have a Bachelor’s degree in Nursing with less than six months of experience, and are just entering active duty to become professional USAF NC officers.  The USAF conducts the program at various AFMS MTFs.  The  preceptor  concept  is  an  integral  part  of  the  program.    The  student  practices  new  skills through  planned  clinical  rotations.    See  ETCA  for  course  description  and  prerequisites.  Apply through AFPC/DPAN. 4.17.3.  Air Force Nurse Residency Program (AFNRP).  The AFNRP and the NTP are formal AETC medical officer courses.  Completion of NTP and AFNRP is a requirement for all NC officers accessed to the USAF with less than 12-months of clinical nursing experience.  The purpose  of  the  AFNRP  is  to  transition  new  nurses  from  education  to  professional  practice roles,  i.e.  novice  to  expert.    The  year-long  (12  months)  residency  program  begins  its  clock with  initial  entry  into  the  AF  NC  to  include  all  accession  sources  (i.e.  direct  commission, NECP,  ROTC,  Service  transfer).    The  residency  encompasses  a  collection  of  deliberate training experiences and opportunities and includes these topics of focus: 1) Patient Centered Care; 2) Communication and Team Work; 3) Evidenced Based Practice; 4) Informatics and 5)  Quality  Initiatives.    The  curriculum  meets  the  2010  mandate  by  the  National  Council  of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) Transition to Practice requirements for entry level nurses. Additionally,  the  AFNRP    is  designed  to  establish  a  culture  of  ongoing  professional  nurse officer development, mentorship and quality patient care. 4.17.4.  Specialty Education Programs.  The USAF offers non-degree courses for active duty nurses  to  specialize  in  various  clinical  nursing  arenas.    These  TDY  specialty  education courses  include  unit-based  nursing  management,  executive  nursing  management,  advanced nursing  practice,  operating  room  nursing,  basic  obstetrical  nursing,  clinical,  neonatal intensive care, infection control & epidemiology and nursing staff development.  See ETCA and letter  for  course descriptions, prerequisites and application procedures. the  AFPC/DPAN  Education  Selection  Board  announcement 4.17.5.  Nursing Fellowships.  The AFMS may offer one or two year fellowships in a variety of military and civilian settings if NC requirements dictate.  Fellowships have been offered in the following areas: Medical Manpower; Director, Nursing Services; Nursing Management; Nursing  Strategic  Planning;  Medical  Readiness;  Managed  Health  Care;  the  U.S.  Congress; Office of the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and in the Office of the Surgeon General. 4.17.6.  EWI  Nursing  programs.    A  ten  month,  non-degree  program  is  available  for  a  very small  number  of  NC  officers.  Leading  companies  in  the  health  care  industry  provide  the education.  The AFMS places the officer with a participating industry in an internship role to AFI41-117  25 MARCH 2015 39 learn its management and organizational strategies and techniques, and to develop knowledge and  skills  that  enhance  AFMS  health  care  operations.  AFPC/DPAN  solicits  applications  as requirements dictate. 4.18.  Multi-Corps Education Programs. 4.18.1.

These  fellowships  follow  HAF/SG  policy  and  guidance  for  this  designation.  Fellowships follow a rigorous training plan focused on professional development.  (T-1). 4.19.3.  Training  plan  is  approved  through  the  respective  Corps  Directors  and  submitted  to SG1N. 4.19.4.  SG1N will obtain final  approval  from  SG1 and notify  AFPC and Air University  of DE-E approved fellowships . (T-1) 4.20.  Externships, Clerkships, and Elective Rotations. 4.20.1.  Medical  facilities  may  provide  externships,  clerkships,  and  elective  rotations  for AFHPSP, USUHS and medical AFROTC educational delay students at the discretion of the MTF/CC.    Civilian  students  of  the  health  professions  attending  programs  at  accredited civilian institutions may also perform externships and clerkships at USAF facilities, provided that a properly executed affiliation agreement has been approved as needed by AFI 41-108, Training Affiliation Agreement.  The DME coordinates and manages externships, clerkships, and elective rotations. 4.20.2.  A training affiliation agreement (TAA) is not required for AFHPSP students on their annual active duty tour (see AFI 41-110).  However, if these students attend an USAF facility as a civilian student, a TAA between the student’s training institution and the USAF facility is required. 4.20.3.  Clerkships.    A  clerkship  is  a  formally  organized  period  of  training  with  a  specific curriculum and objectives designed to give the students experience, knowledge, and skills in a specific area.  Usually, only students in their third or fourth year of professional training are 40 AFI41-117  25 MARCH 2015 eligible  for  clerkships.    The  clerkship  is  a  highly  structured  educational  experience  that enables the staff or faculty to judge the students ability to put learning into practice; take on responsibility;  and  continue  to  develop.    A  clerkship  usually  receives  academic  credit  from the  student’s  professional  school.    Clerkships  can  only  occur  at  training  sites  that  have  a properly executed affiliation agreement. 4.20.4.  Evaluation  Reports.    The  immediate  supervisor  must  prepare  an  AF  Form  494  for students  and  residents  completing  an  externship,  clerkship,  or  elective  rotation  at  USAF MTFs.  (T-1)  The PD must endorse the AF Form 494.  (T-1.  Special evaluation forms and reports from the student’s school must also be completed if required by that institution.  (T-1) 4.20.5.  Student  Restrictions.    Military  students  and  residents  performing  externships, clerkships,  or  elective  rotations  must  be  on  official  orders.    (T-1)  Civilian  students  (or AFHPSP students attending in civilian status) performing clerkships or externships at USAF MTFs must do so at no expense to the Government.  (T-1 4.20.6.  Students  enrolled  in  civilian  sponsored  degree  programs  or  residencies  under  AFIT Healthcare  Education  Division  management,  are  expected  to  complete  all  clinical  rotations (elective or required) in  the local area of the institution.  Students with curriculum required clinical experiences that cannot be completed in the local area of the institution are placed on official and funded orders. 4.21.  Need Identification. 4.21.1.  A USAF organization contemplating establishing a new formal training program (not continuing  health  education)  must  first  determine  whether  there  is  an  ongoing  AF requirement  for  such  training,  whether  the  facility  has  the  patient  population  and  resources available to provide such training and whether providing such training at an AF facility is in the  best  interests  of  the  AFMS.    (T-1)    In  some  circumstances,  it  is  more  cost  effective  to utilize existing civilian programs to provide the training. 4.21.1.1.  Medical  Necessity  Evaluation  and  Economic  Documentation  System (MEDNEEDS) Study.   The facility commander  documents the need for  a new program by  conducting  a  MEDNEEDS  study.   The  requesting  facility  should  contact AFPC/DPAN for guidance on the recommended format of the MEDNEEDS study. In the study: 4.21.1.2.  Evaluate the facility capability. 4.21.1.3.  Outline a proposed program curriculum. 4.21.1.4.  Estimate the number of faculty and ancillary personnel required. 4.21.1.5.  Estimate the number of students to be trained. 4.21.1.6.  Review any written documentation on the course (that is, essentials of approved residencies, phase 2 training plan, and so forth) to ensure that the program can adequately meet requirements. 4.21.1.7.  Develop a budget for the program, estimating the costs involved in maintaining the program.  ) 4.21.1.8.  Outline  the  anticipated  benefits  to  the  USAF  by  having  such  training  at  this facility. AFI41-117  25 MARCH 2015 41 4.21.2.  Formal Approval.  Requests for new programs should be reviewed by the DME prior to  approval  by  the  facility  commander.    The  MTF/CC  forwards  the  MEDNEEDS  study  to AFPC/DPAN who provides additional recommendations to USAF/SG.  Once USAF/SG has approved  establishment  of  the  program,  the  MTF/CC  requests  formal  approval  from  the appropriate civilian accrediting agency, if the program is an accredited discipline.  The DME sends a copy of all correspondence and accreditation application documents to AFPC/DPAN. 4.22.  Accreditation. 4.22.1.  MC and DC Residency Programs.  Apply for accreditation through the ACGME or ADA CODA. 4.22.2.  BSC and NC Specialties.  Apply for accreditation through the appropriate specialty board or organization. 4.22.3.  After  provisional  accreditation,  the  program  may  be  initiated  or  continued.    The DME  sends  a  copy  of  all  correspondence  with  the  accrediting  agency  to  AFPC/DPAN.    A copy of the letter or certificate of accreditation goes into the annual self-study. 42 AFI41-117  25 MARCH 2015 Chapter 5 CONTINUING HEALTH EDUCATION (CHE) PROGRAMS 5.1.  General. 5.1.1.

In addition,  the  NC  accepts  four  categories  of  educational  activities  through  its  continuing education recognition program.  Additional information on submitting a CEARP package is  available  on  the  kx  or  the  vCHE  website  for  descriptions  of  acceptable  educational activities and approval procedures. 5.6.5.  MSC.  While board certification in  a career-field  related professional  organization is not mandated, it is evidence of continuing education and adherence to professional standards associated  with  the  officer’s  clinical  or  administrative  specialty.    Consequently,  the  USAF MSCs  considers  board  certification  an  important  accomplishment.    As  such,  they  need comply  with  the  continuing  education  requirements  of  that  professional  organization  with which they are affiliated. 5.7.  Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard Medical Service Personnel. 5.7.1.  AFRC/SG and NGB/SG provide guidance on these programs. 5.7.1.1.  Officers  must  fulfill  the  above  requirements  according  to  their  corps  and  their directives.  (T-1) 5.7.1.2.

Commander Responsibility. 5.10.1.  MTF/CCs  help  personnel  to  meet  their  individual  CHE  requirements  within  the constraints  of  current  resources.    Commanders  may,  if  funds  and  staffing  permit,  allow medical  service  personnel  to  attend  an  approved  CHE  program  in  a  funded  status  on temporary  duty.    Conference  attendance  needs  to  be  IAW  current  guidance  (see  4.10.3  and 5.6.1 of this instruction.). Individuals approved for locally funded TDY should have one year of retainability in the AFMS.  Commanders may approve individuals with less than one year retainability if attendance serves the best interest of the organization and the USAF.  In the absence of USAF funds to sponsor a member for attendance at an approved CHE activity, the commander may allow the individual to attend such programs in a P-TDY status (IAW AFI 36-3003). 5.11.  Personnel Responsibilities. 5.11.1.  Members  of  the  AFMS  and  Civil  Service  Personnel  must  keep  an  accurate  and current  record  of  all  CHE  activities  for  licensure,  recertification,  and  credentialing.    (T-0).  The  absence  of  USAF  funds  for  sponsored  attendance  does  not  excuse  the  individual  from achieving  CHE  requirements,  meeting  the  requirements  for  continued  licensure,  or  meeting the minimum requirements of the AFSC or Civilian Position Description. 5.12.  Sources of CHE. 5.12.1.  Members  wanting  to  participate  in  CHE  activities  can  turn  to  a  number  of  sources.  However, officers are authorized funded TDYs IAW current TDY policy and commander’s discretion.  Requests for multiple TDYs in one fiscal year should be considered on a case by case basis. 5.13.  Locally Developed Programs. 5.13.1.  MTF/CCs  must  ensure  CHE  programs  are  based  on  the  facilities  learning  needs identified from an effective needs assessment.  (T-1). 5.14.  Programs Developed Outside the USAF. 5.14.1.  Programs  and  tests  distributed  by  accredited  national  professional  organizations should be considered bona fide CHE activities.  Commanders may use local operations and maintenance funds to purchase self-assessment tests and materials for eligible members. 5.15.  Locally Funded TDY. 5.15.1.  Commanders  may  use  operations  and  maintenance  funds  to  finance  attendance  at approved CHE programs offered by civilian institutions and agencies IAW current TDY and Conference Attendance Guidance (reference 4.10.3 of this instruction). 5.15.2.  Use funds for this purpose only if such programs serve the best interest of the USAF. 5.15.3.  An accrediting national  professional  organization should be selected and the course should award participants at least six hours of continuing education credit per day. 5.15.4.  Individuals approved for locally funded TDY must have the required retainability in the AFMS. (IAW AFI 36-3003).  (T-1). 5.15.5.  ANG medical officers can attend military and non-military CHE in a funded status, when  the  CHE  is  accomplished  during  annual  training  days  and/or  locally  managed 46 AFI41-117  25 MARCH 2015 workdays (special training, etc.)  Members need to follow the current TDY and Conference Attendance  Guidance.  The  costs  for  TDY,  per  diem,  and  transportation  comes  from  local resources  Membership  in  the  sponsored  professional  organization  is  strongly  recommended for attendance in duty status.  The subject material presented at the training activity should be directly related to the ANG member’s duty AFSC or to other officially designated duties. 5.16.  Permissive TDY. 5.16.1.  An  individual  may  attend  a  military  or  civilian-sponsored  CHE  program  in  P-TDY status,  provided  CHE  credit  is  awarded.    The  member  pays  for  their  own  travel  expenses, registration fees, tuition, and other expenses. 5.16.2.  The local MTF/CC may approve P-TDY of fewer than 30 days for CHE, depending on the needs of the facility.  Do not  approve P-TDY in conjunction with  a PCS to enter an AFIT  sponsored  graduate  education  program  if  the  courses  are  a  required  part  of  the curriculum of the training program the officer is about to enter. 5.17.  Application Procedures. 5.17.1.  Apply  for  locally  funded  TDY  or  P-TDYs  for  CHE  through  the  DME  or  unit commander  unless  local  policy  specifies  otherwise.    Apply  for  funded  formal  courses according to  ETCA.  Civilian conference attendance/TDY is  to  be  IAW  current  conference policy. 5.17.2.  Eligibility.    Individuals  approved  for  a  USAF  or  DoD  centrally  funded  TDY  must have  one-year  retainability.    (T-1)    Commanders  ensure  that  individuals  have  retainability before funding the TDY. 5.18.  CHE Programs. 5.18.1.  CHE programs at USAF MTFs, schools, and other medical activities should provide acceptable CHE credit for attendees.  Acceptable CHE credit may be certified for programs that  are  accredited  or  approved.    Organizations  may  apply  for  program  credit  or  approval directly through AFPC/DPAN for both  MC officers and NC officers.  The USAF DC is  an approved  CHE  provider  by  the  American  Dental  Association  Continuing  Education Recognition  Program  (ADA  CERP).    Dental  Treatment  Facilities  may  apply  for  program credit  directly  through  the  59th  Dental  Group,  Education  Department,  who  maintains accreditation oversight for the USAF Dental Service. 5.19.  Direct Application  . 5.19.1.  Facility  and  organization  program  planners  may  apply  for  CME  and  CNE  directly through  AFPC/DPAN,  national  or  state  agencies  that  are  authorized  to  approve  or  accredit CHE programs. 5.19.2.  Organizations submitting programs for approval or accreditation by civilian agencies must  ensure  the  program  meets  the  published  standards  of  that  agency.    (T-0).    Use  local operations  and  maintenance  funds  to  finance  fees  and  other  costs.    Some  agencies  do  not approve  individual  programs  but  accredit  the  institution  to  offer  programs  for  approved credit. 5.19.3.  Individual  MTFs  may  seek  authority  (through  the  agency)  to  approve  their  own programs. AFI41-117  25 MARCH 2015 47 5.20.  Application to AFPC/DPAN. 5.20.1.
