SRP Policy. 2.1.1.  Reenlistment in any component of the Total Force is not an inherent individual right.  It is a privilege and confers an obligation to serve.  Airmen may be considered for reenlistment or extension if they (T-2): 2.1.1.1.  Meet eligibility requirements. 2.1.1.2.  Have qualities essential for continued service. 2.1.1.3.  Can perform duty in a career field in which the Air Force has a specific need. 2.2.  SRP Objective. 2.2.1.  The SRP objective is to ensure the Air Force retains only Airmen who consistently demonstrate the capability and willingness to maintain high professional standards. 2.2.2.  The SRP applies to all enlisted personnel; however, SRP is administered separately within each component. 2.3.  SRP Authority. 2.3.1.  Commander/civilian directors have total SRP selection authority as long as no other factors barring immediate reenlistment exist.  Commander/civilian directors may non-select any Airman for reenlistment at any time outside of the SRP window.  Being rendered ineligible to reenlist can impact an Airman’s opportunity to be selected for an assignment, promotion, and/or  retraining  and  may  impact  the  Airman’s  future  eligibility  to  be  retained.    The selection/non-selection  decision  will  not  be  based  on  Airman’s  career  intent  and  will  be consistent with other qualitative decisions.  Commander/civilian directors will not use the SRP to deny reenlistment when involuntary separation is more appropriate.  Commander/civilian directors may reverse their selection/non-selection decision at any time. (T-1). 2.3.2.  For IMA and PIRR members, the selection authority is the commander of the unit of assignment/attachment. (Applicable to AFR only) 2.4.  SRP and Airman Promotion Program Relationship. 2.4.1.  The objective of both programs is to ensure the career force consists of highly qualified, professional Airmen.  SRP non-selection makes Airmen ineligible for promotion. 2.4.2.  SRP non-selection automatically cancels projected promotion line numbers. (Applies to RegAF only). 2.4.3.  Airmen non-selected for reenlistment also become ineligible for promotion. (Applies to AFR and ANG). 2.5.  SRP  Process.  The  SRP  process  varies  depending  upon  the  assigned  component  of  the Airman  being  considered  for  reenlistment.  These  variances  are  divided  into  separate  sections below. 2.6.  SRP in the Regular Air Force. 16 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 2.6.1.  The  MPS  Career  Development  Section  receives  a  Master  SRP  Roster  from  the Personnel Systems Manager (PSM) Not Later Than (NLT) the 1st of each month. 2.6.1.1.  This roster identifies First Term Airmen (FTA) who have completed 33 months (4  year  enlistees)  or  57  months  (6  year  enlistees)  on  current  enlistment  and  Second Term/Career Airmen within 13 months of ETS. 2.6.1.1.1.  Two separate Reports on Individual Personnel (RIPs) are also produced:  one for the Airman and one for the Airman’s supervisor.  The RIPs notify the Airman of his/her SRP/Career Job Reservation (CJR) eligibility window and provide instructions on reenlistment.  Supervisors use the other RIP to provide a recommendation to the commander/civilian director in order to aid in the selection/non-selection decision. 2.6.2.  The  MPS  sends  SRP  consideration  rosters  and  RIPs  monthly  to  the  respective commander/civilian directors.  The roster is used to control/suspense RIPs to supervisors.  The SRP Roster has the following four parts: 2.6.2.1.  Part  I  (SRP  Actions)  identifies  Airmen  requiring  SRP  consideration  or reconsideration.  Part I also generates RIPs for Airmen requiring SRP consideration (except for  Airmen  with  RE  code  3B).    The  RIPs  assist  supervisors  and  commander/civilian directors in evaluating Airmen for continued service.  Supervisors wishing to recommend denial of reenlistment must initiate an AF Form 418. (T-1).  Commander/civilian directors must take SRP action within 30 calendar days for Airmen whose ineligibility condition no longer exists. (T-1). 2.6.2.2.  Part  II  (SRP  Monitor)  identifies  Airmen  with  quality  indicators  (referral evaluations, an Unfavorable Information File [UIF], etc.), who were already considered under  SRP.    Commander/civilian  directors  use  this  product  to  determine  if  SRP reconsideration  is  appropriate.    If  so,  the  unit  will  initiate  an  AF  Form  418  for selection/non-selection. (T-1). 2.6.2.3.  Part III (CJR Eligibility) identifies eligible FTA who have not yet applied for a CJR.  RIPs advise Airmen and immediate supervisors of the CJR eligibility criteria and their responsibilities. 2.6.2.4.  Part IV (Reenlistment Ineligibility) identifies reenlistment-ineligible Airmen. 2.6.3.  Commander/civilian directors review the SRP roster to consider whether members will be denied reenlistment, selected for reenlistment or to reverse previous non-selection.  The commander/civilian director only receives AF Form 418s non-recommending retention from supervisors.  The supervisor initiates an AF Form 418 and completes Section I and II and forwards to the commander/civilian director. 2.6.3.1.  If the commander/civilian director agrees with the supervisor’s recommendation to non-select, the commander/civilian director completes the AF Form 418 and forwards to the MPS along with Part I of the SRP roster. 2.6.3.2.  If  the  commander/civilian  director  disagrees  on  the  non-selection,  then  the commander/civilian director marks the form accordingly and files it based on the AFRIMS RDS. AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 17 2.6.3.3.  If the commander/civilian director determines the Airman will not be selected for reenlistment, then the commander/civilian director may direct the supervisor to initiate an AF Form 418 or he/she may initiate an AF Form 418 and forward to the MPS. 2.6.3.4.  Only the commander/civilian director’s decision selects or non-selects the Airman for continued service. (Note:  Airmen non-selected for reenlistment will separate on their current  date  of  separation  and  will  not  be  extended  for  any  reason  other  than  appeal processing.  Therefore, it is incumbent commander/civilian directors make timely non-selection decisions). (T-1). 2.6.3.5.  After 30 days (from date of SRP Roster), if the commander/civilian director has not taken action to deny reenlistment (AF Form 418), then Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS)  automatically  updates  RE  code  to  allow  reenlistment.    RE  codes  update  as follows (See Chapter 5 for definitions): 2.6.4.  Reenlistment Codes. 2.6.4.1.  RE code 3C changes to RE code 1R. 2.6.4.2.  RE code 1M changes to RE code 1K or 1P or 1Q. (Note:  If the PSM office has not received the Master SRP Rosters [RRSRTR], confirm that system is configured to handle/distribute this roster.  If the PSM office has verified the configuration and still has not received this roster by the 1st of month, contact the Operations Control Center [DSN 665-5004] to see if there is an issue with delivery/receipt of MilPDS products). 2.6.5.  Delaying SRP Actions. 2.6.5.1.  When Airmen require SRP consideration upon arrival to the new duty location, the gaining commander/civilian director may delay SRP consideration for no more than 90 calendar days after Date Arrived Station (DAS). 2.6.5.2.  If the Airman received SRP consideration, the former MPS advises the gaining MPS of the selection or non-selection status and forwards the supporting documentation. 2.6.5.3.  If the Airman did not receive SRP consideration, the new commander/civilian director may delay SRP consideration. 2.6.6.  Early SRP Consideration. 2.6.6.1.  Commander/civilian directors will conduct early SRP consideration for Airmen who have not previously received formal SRP consideration as specified below. (T-1). 2.6.6.2.  Airman  is  otherwise  eligible  to  reenlist  (RE  code  3C  or  1M)  and  requests voluntary early separation for one of the reasons listed below: 2.6.6.2.1.  PALACE CHASE. 2.6.6.2.2.  Officer  training  program  (other  than  Air  Force  Reserve  Officer  Training Corps  [AFROTC]).  (Refer  to  paragraph  5.11.  for  additional  RE  code  update information). 2.6.6.2.3.  Early release to further education. 2.6.6.2.4.  Sole surviving son or daughter. 18 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 2.6.6.2.5.  Early release from extension or voluntary separation programs directed by USAF. 2.6.6.2.6.  Accepting public office. 2.6.6.2.7.  Pregnancy or childbirth. 2.6.6.2.8.  End of year early release. 2.6.6.2.9.  Miscellaneous reasons. 2.6.6.2.10.  Early  separation  programs  directed  by  USAF.    AFPC  Separations  will announce the program and provide the eligibility criteria and processing instructions.  AFPC Reenlistments must work with AFPC Separations once the separation is loaded to change RE code to 3A or 2X for FTA and verify RE code has been changed to 1J or 2X for Second Term and Career Airmen. (T-1). 2.6.7.  When to use AF Form 418. 2.6.7.1.  The  AF  Form  418  documents  non-selection/selection  for  continued  service  or reconsideration actions and also documents an Airman’s reenlistment ineligibility due to unsatisfactory fitness.  Commander/civilian directors use the AF Form 418 when: 2.6.7.1.1.  Denying reenlistment during the SRP process. 2.6.7.1.2.  Airmen were initially ineligible for consideration during their SRP window for  reasons  in  Table  5.4,  Table  5.5  or  Table  5.6,  but  later  become  eligible  for consideration.  Commander/civilian director must initiate SRP consideration within 30 calendar days. (T-1). 2.6.7.1.3.  Airmen  previously  denied  reenlistment  and  commander/civilian  director reverses decision. 2.6.7.1.4.  Airmen require early SRP consideration.  (Note: When removing negative RE codes [to include RE code 4K] for Airmen who are not in their SRP window or not eligible for SRP consideration, update RE code 3C or 1M respectively.  These Airmen appear on the SRP roster upon entering their SRP window.  If the Airman is in his/her SRP window, then update RE code to 3B and these Airmen appear on Part I of next month roster for SRP reconsideration). 2.6.8.  Commander/civilian director considerations on SRP. Commander/civilian directors will consider the following before making a decision: (T-1). 2.6.8.1.  Enlisted Performance Report (EPR) ratings. 2.6.8.2.  Unfavorable information from any substantiated source. 2.6.8.3.  The  Airman’s  willingness  to  comply  with  Air  Force  standards  (i.e.  fitness, dress/appearance, timeliness etc.). 2.6.8.4.  The Airman’s ability (or lack of) to meet required training and duty performance levels. 2.6.8.5.  A  fit  for  duty  finding  by  a  Physical  Evaluation  Board  (PEB)  does  not automatically entitle an Airman to reenlist upon completion of their required active service.  AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 19 However, an Airman may not be denied reenlistment on the basis of the same condition for which a PEB found the Airman fit for duty. 2.6.9.  Derogatory information from a previous enlistment will not be considered as a basis for denial of subsequent reenlistments. 2.6.10.  Non-selection for Reenlistment. 2.6.10.1.  The supervisor recommends that the Airman not be selected for reenlistment by completing  AF  Form  418  and  forwarding  to  the  commander/civilian  director  with supporting documentation. 2.6.10.2.  The commander/civilian director reviews the AF Form 418 and SRP RIP, signs the SRP roster and notifies the Airman of the non-selection (unit only).  If the Airman does not appeal the decision, the commander/civilian director notifies the Airman they will be discharged on their ETS (DOS for RegAF), and sends the SRP roster and AF Form 418 to the MPS for processing. 2.6.10.3.  The MPS receives the SRP decision and updates the Airman’s RE code. 2.6.11.  Commander/civilian director action on AF Form 418. 2.6.11.1.  The commander/civilian director places an "X" or initials in the appropriate item of the AF Form 418 and enters the specific reason(s) for non-selection in the remarks area.  The commander/civilian director signs and dates the form and attaches  any supporting documentation  to  substantiate  non-selection  decision.    Supervisor  recommendation  is optional.  (Note:  When Airmen are unavailable due to Temporary Duty [TDY], leave, etc. and do not return within 30 days of the decision date, commander/civilian director includes the following statement in the upper margin of the AF Form 418:  "Airman is unavailable due to [TDY, leave, etc.] until [expected return date]"). 2.6.11.1.1.  For Airmen non-selected under SRP, the commander/civilian director may discuss the non-selection with the Airman’s supervisor before making final decision. The commander/civilian director will discuss the following items with the Airman:  specific reasons for non-selection, areas needing improvement, promotion ineligibility (to  include  automatic  cancellation  of  projected  promotion  line  numbers)  and  the possibility of future reconsideration and selection.  (T-1). 2.6.11.1.2.  Counsel Airman on appeal process and ensure they understand they must acknowledge receipt of notification immediately, but they have up to 3 calendar days to render an appeal intent.  Airmen who will have completed at least 16, but fewer than 20  years  Total  Active  Federal  Military  Service  (TAFMS)  on  current  ETS  will  be counseled on their ETP options.  Also see paragraph 2.6.15. (T-1). 2.6.11.1.2.1.  Airmen may elect to appeal the denial of reenlistment. 2.6.11.1.2.2.  Airmen  may  elect  not  to  appeal  the  denial  decision  and  will  be separated or retired, if eligible on current DOS. 2.6.11.1.2.3.  Airmen may elect to request an exception to policy (ETP) to extend to reach minimum retirement eligibility and not appeal the denial decision. 2.6.11.1.3.  Ensure Airman acknowledges receipt of notification of non-selection on the AF Form 418 during the personal interview. (T-1). 20 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 2.6.11.1.4.  Ensure Airman renders their appeal intent on the AF Form 418 within 3 calendar days of acknowledgment, if applicable. (T-1). 2.6.11.1.5.  Provide  Airman  with  a  copy  of  the  AF  Form  418  and  supporting documentation, maintains a copy of the package and sends the original to the MPS for processing. (T-1). 2.6.11.1.6.  If appealing, directs the Airman to report to the MPS for counseling on appeal process and requirements. (T-1). 2.6.11.2.  For Airmen reconsidered and selected: 2.6.11.2.1.  The commander/civilian director places an "X" or initials in the appropriate item of Section II and commander/civilian director signs and dates the form. (T-1). 2.6.11.2.2.  Forwards AF Form 418 to MPS for update of appropriate RE code. 2.6.12.  MPS Action with AF Form 418. (T-1). 2.6.12.1.  Upon receipt of the AF Form 418 from unit, the MPS will quality review the AF Form 418 and return to unit if incomplete.  If the AF Form 418 is complete, enter the Airman’s current RE code and new RE code (2X, 4J, etc.) and date MilPDS was updated on the AF Form 418.   (T-1). 2.6.12.2.  Update appropriate RE code in MilPDS (2X, 4J, etc.) upon receipt of the AF Form 418, regardless of appeal intent. 2.6.12.3.  Review the AF Form 418 to determine member’s intent to appeal.  If member does not intend to appeal, forward the form for filing in Automated Records Management System (ARMS).  If member intends to appeal refer to appeal processing procedures. 2.6.12.3.1.  Update appeal suspense date in appropriate block. 2.6.12.3.2.  Counsel  the  Airman  on  the  appeal  suspense  requirements  and  appeal process. 2.6.12.3.3.  Extend Airmen as needed to await results of appeal of non-selection. 2.6.13.  Processing SRP Non-selection Appeals. 2.6.13.1.  Airmen’s appeals are due to the MPS no later than 10 calendar days from the date the Airman indicates his/her appeal intent on the AF Form 418.  Written extension requests must be submitted on or before the 10th calendar day.  Requests for extensions past the 10th calendar day may be approved by the FSS commander/civilian director if circumstances  warrant;  early  submissions  are  authorized.    FSS  commander/civilian directors limit the extension to 5 calendar days and only one extension may be approved.  Airmen with unique and documented circumstances such as emergency leave, illness or injury may be granted a delay to submit their appeal.  In such cases, the Airman must immediately advise the MPS of the circumstances and provide the MPS with supporting documentation.  The MPS will forward supporting documentation to AFPC Reenlistments for review and if approved, a new appeal suspense date will be established.  Requests submitted after the 10th calendar day will be disapproved, and the Airman is considered to have failed to submit the appeal.  (Exception:  If the 10th calendar day falls on a weekend or holiday, an Airman may submit an appeal on the following duty day).  The MPS: AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 21 2.6.13.2.  Suspenses a copy of the AF Form 418 pending receipt of the appeal package. 2.6.13.2.1.  Completes  the  AF  Form  418  by  marking  “Airman’s  appeal  was  not received by the appeal date”, dating and signing the block, as applicable, or forward the original for file in the ARMS and return a copy to the Airman’s commander/civilian director. 2.6.13.2.2.  Completes the AF Form 418 by marking “Airman’s appeal was received by  appeal  date”,  dating  and  signing  the  block,  as  applicable.  Continue  appeal processing. 2.6.13.3.  The MPS constructs a case file containing the AF Form 418 (with any attached documentation from the commander/civilian director), appeal documentation submitted by the  Airman,  the  last  5  EPRs,  a  copy  of  AF  Form  1137,  Unfavorable  Information  File Summary  (if  applicable)  and  any  other  pertinent  information.    Legal  reviews  and  the commander/civilian director recommendations are not considered new information, unless either adds new documentation/information.  (Note:  Provide Airmen 3 calendar days to rebut any new information added to the case file after they submit their appeal.) 2.6.13.4.  Reviewing officials must return cases to the MPS before forwarding up the chain when new documentation or comments are added to the case file by any reviewing official.  (Note:  This does not apply to commander/civilian director recommendations based on existing documentation/matters or legal reviews). 2.6.13.5.  The  MPS  will  provide  the  Airman  a  copy  of  the  added  documentation  and suspense the rebuttal.  If the Airman fails to submit a rebuttal as required, the MPS will indicate the Airman failed to submit rebuttal remarks to the documentation dated, (insert date) as required in the remarks and forward the case file to the next reviewing level. 2.6.13.5.1.  Within 5 workdays, the MPS sends the case file to the servicing legal office for review and suspenses for completion.  The servicing legal office refers the case back to the MPS after legal review. (T-1). 2.6.13.5.2.  Within 5 workdays of receiving the legal review, the MPS forwards the case file to the Airman’s appeal authority as outlined in Table 2.1.  All packages are routed through the Airman’s group commander when the appeal authority is the wing commander and routed through both the group and wing commanders when the appeal authority is Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF).  Any commander in the reviewing chain may approve an Airman’s appeal.  (Note:  After the case file has been sent to the appropriate appellate authority and the appeal has been denied, the case file cannot be sent to the next level to have the decision overturned). 2.6.13.5.2.1.  Extend Airmen as needed while undergoing the appeal process IAW Table 6.1, Rule 22. 2.6.14.  When the SecAF is the appeal authority, process the case as follows: 2.6.14.1.  After  all routing is complete; the MPS maintains a copy of the case file  and forward  the  original  package  to  the  Airman’s  parent  MAJCOM/Direct  Reporting  Unit (DRU)/Field Operating Agency (FOA) A1 for administrative accuracy and SRP eligibility verification. 22 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 2.6.14.2.  MAJCOM/DRU/FOA  A1  sends  the  case  file  to  MAJCOM/DRU/FOA  legal office for review and the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA legal office includes legal advisory in case file.  If upon receipt of the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA legal review the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA A1 approves appeal, complete the AF Form 418 and return the case to the servicing MPS.  If the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA A1 recommends disapproval, the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA A1 includes  the  MAJCOM/DRU/FOA  legal  review  and  MAJCOM/DRU/FOA  A1  denial recommendation and forwards the case files to AFPC Reenlistments via Legal Transit for processing. 2.6.14.3.  AFPC Reenlistments will ensure the case file meets all requirements outlined above or coordinate with the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA A1 as needed on missing/incomplete documentation before processing to AFPC legal office.  Send case file to AFPC legal office for legal review.  Upon receipt of AFPC’s legal review, AFPC Reenlistments will update and forward the case to the Headquarters Air Force, Force Management Policy Division for processing to the SecAF and for final decision.  After receiving SecAF decision, AFPC Reenlistments will notify the servicing MPS and the Airman’s MAJCOM/DRU/FOA A1 of the decision and will send a copy of the SecAF memorandum. AFPC Reenlistments will forward a copy to ARMS for filing in the Airman’s record. (T-1). 2.6.14.4.  Any commander in the reviewing chain may approve an Airman’s appeal.  The appeal  authority  completes  the  AF  Form  418.    (Exception:    SecAF  memo  constitutes completion of this section). 2.6.14.5.  Upon receipt of completed appeal case files, the MPS provides a copy to the Airman’s  commander/civilian  director.

The commander places an "X" in the "Selected" block on AF Form 418, has the member sign the AF Form 418, and processes it as an initial selection; sends the form to MPS.  The MPS updates the reenlistment code in accordance with this instruction. AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 37 Chapter 3 CAREER JOB RESERVATION (CJR) PROGRAM (APPLIES TO REGAF ONLY) 3.1.  CJR Program Eligibility.  The CJR program applies to Airmen in the RegAF and is not applicable to Air National Guard or AF Reserve Airmen.  The CJR program objective is to prevent surpluses and shortages in the career force.  AFPC controls first term reenlistments by maintaining a career job requirement file for each Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). 3.1.1.  All FTA, regardless of AFSC, must have a CJR in order to reenlist. (T-1). 3.1.2.  If the Airman does not receive a CJR during his/her window based on the CJR “rank-order” process, they will not be allowed to compete for a CJR later in their career and he/she will be required to separate on their DOS. (T-1). Table 3.1.  CJR Window. ITEM 1  If the Airman is a: 4-year enlistee 2 6-year enlistee then the CJR window is  first duty day of the month they complete 35 months, but not later than the last duty day of the month they complete 43 months  first duty day of the month they complete 59 months, but not later than the last duty day of the month they complete 67 months Notes  1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3 Notes:  1. Commander/civilian directors and supervisors receive monthly computer-generated products identifying CJR-eligible Airmen who have not received an approval. 2. FTA who requests a CJR in their secondary AFSC must complete a memorandum requesting a CJR in other than their Control Air Force Specialty Code (CAFSC). (T-1).  Requests are submitted through the MPS to AFPC Reenlistments via normal processing procedures.  3. Airmen will only meet CJR boards during their CJR eligibility window if eligible. (T-1). 3.2.  CJR “Rank-order” Process  . AFPC Reenlistments uses a quality "rank-order" process to issue CJRs to Airmen serving in constrained AFSCs.  Airmen compete for a CJR in their respective initial Term of Enlistment (TOE) group (4-year or 6-year enlistee).  AFPC awards CJRs to the most qualified Airmen within their initial TOE year group, and quotas are allocated on a percentage basis of those competing in each TOE year group for that month’s board.  (For example:  If in a particular month 70 percent of eligible Airmen are 6-yr enlistees, then 70 percent of the available quotas are awarded to the top 6-year enlistees and the remaining 30 percent are awarded to the top 4-year enlistees). Table 3.2.  CJR Rank-order Factors. (T-1). Item  Factor   Explanation     Top 3 Performance Assessments  Performance Assessments are not added together, AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 Any UIF code puts the Airman at the bottom of their AFSC list.  (Example:  A SSgt with a UIF will be considered after all other Airmen who do not have a UIF [regardless of rank])  they are considered as individual factors. SSgt is considered before SrA  SSgt selects are considered before SrA Senior DOR is considered first Senior TAFMSD is considered first UIF    38 1 2 3 4 5 6 Grade Projected grade Date of Rank (DOR) Total Active Federal Military Service Date (TAFMSD) 3.3.  CJR  Waiting  List.  Airmen  on  the  waiting  list  compete  on  a  monthly  basis  within  their CAFSC.  The waiting list rank order number may fluctuate as information changes or as new Airmen  apply.    (Example:  If  an  Airman  has  received  a  UIF  or  if  new  Airmen  with  projected promotions apply since the last board, the Airman moves down on the list).  Monthly notification RIPs  to  supervisors  advise  Airmen  and  their  supervisors  of  current  waiting  list  numbers  and encourage retraining. 3.3.1.  Airmen  receive  final  rank-order  consideration  during  the  month  they  complete  43 months for a 4-year enlistee or the month they complete 67 months for a 6-year enlistee.  If a CJR has not been awarded, the Airman cannot reenlist in their current AFSC and separate on their DOS.  (Example:  If an Airman’s DOS is 15 Nov 2016, final rank-order consideration occurs through June 2016). (T-1). 3.3.2.  Airmen only meet CJR boards during their CJR eligibility window (35th – 43rd month for 4 year enlistees, 59th – 67th month for 6-year enlistees.  Their CJR window cannot be extended to match the new DOS from any extension.  (Note:  Airmen with approved CJRs who extend their enlistments will have their CJR expire on the new DOS.  MPS must request that AFPC Reenlistments update CJR expiration date to reflect new DOS.) (T-1). 3.3.3.  Airmen  who  are  on  the  CJR  waiting  list  and  whose  AFSC  is  removed  from  the constrained list will receive a CJR.  Airmen who are removed from the waiting list prior to the AFSC being removed (RE code 3I) do not receive supplemental consideration unless AF/A1 provides further guidance. 3.4.  Processing Wing or Senior Host Commander Override Requests.  Airmen qualify for a Commander Override if they were on the CJR waiting list, but  were not  awarded a CJR during his/her  window  (RE  code  3I).    When  a  Commander  Override  request  is  approved,  AFPC Reenlistments will reduce the number of CJRs available in that AFSC during the next monthly CJR board. (T-1).  This means that one Airman on the constrained wait list does not receive a CJR.  Therefore, commander/civilian directors must ensure the Airman they recommend is deserving of a  wing  or  senior  host  Commander  Override  request.  (T-1).    Commander  Override  approval authority rests with AFPC/CC. 3.4.1.  Wing or senior host commander may request a Commander Override in rare instances and only if the Airman meets all of the following:  AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 39 Table 3.3.  Commander Override Considerations. Item 1 2 3 Factor   Not have a UIF or lost time on their current enlistment No record of nonjudicial punishment (NJP) on current enlistment All EPRs must reflect that the member has met the Minimum Expectations 3.4.2.  Commander/civilian  directors  process  override  requests  to  the  wing  or  senior  host commander through the MPS.  Units include in the case file a: 3.4.2.1.  Memorandum  signed  by  the  Airman,  to  include  an  endorsement  from  the commander/civilian director. 3.4.2.2.  Copies of all EPRs. 3.4.2.3.  Current  Single  Uniform  Report  Format  (SURF)  (AAD005-Active  Amn Reenlistment SURF). 3.4.2.4.  Any  other  supporting  documentation  to  be  considered.    (Example:  Copy  of approved decoration citations or additional awards the Airman has received (if applicable); Below-the-Zone (BTZ), promotion to SSgt, Stripes for Exceptional Performers (STEP) promotions, 12 Outstanding Airman of the Year (OAY), Airman of the Year, Professional Military Education (PME) awards, etc.). 3.4.3.  The Chief, MPS will review the case file and process/route the case file to the wing or senior host commander for approval/disapproval.  The MPS returns a Commander’s Override request to the originating unit if it does not meet the minimum criteria in Table 3.3. 3.4.4.  The wing or senior host commander reviews the case file and indicate his/her decision.  If the wing or senior host commander disapproves the request, the case file is returned to the Chief, MPS who notifies the Airman’s commander/civilian director of the disapproval. 3.4.5.  If  wing  or  senior  host  commander  recommends  approval,  the  commander  indicates his/her approval and return to the case file to the MPS.  The MPS forwards approved case files to AFPC Reenlistments in accordance with current processing instructions. 3.4.6.  AFPC Reenlistments will review request and ensure all requirements are met.  Case files not meeting the criteria or missing required documents will be returned to the MPS for correction.  AFPC Reenlistments will: 3.4.6.1.  Construct case file and forward to AFPC/CC for approval/disapproval. 3.4.6.2.  If the Commander’s Override is disapproved, AFPC Reenlistments notifies the MPS  of  disapproval  action.    The  MPS  notifies  the  commander/civilian  director  of  the disapproval. 3.4.6.3.  If the Commander’s Override is approved, AFPC Reenlistments: 3.4.6.3.1.  Updates CJR code “C” in MilPDS. (T-1). 3.4.6.3.2.  Notifies  MPS  of  approval  action. commander/civilian director of the approval.   The  MPS  notifies the  unit 3.4.7.  Overrides are not permitted once an AFSC has been removed from the constraint list or upon closure or suspension of the CJR program. 40 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 3.5.  Actions on Receipt of Approved CJRs.  Approved CJRs do not expire until the Airman’s DOS.  If an Airman extends his/her enlistment, the MPS submits a request to AFPC Reenlistments to update CJR expiration to match the new DOS.  Airmen can have an approved CJR on file and an approved separation on file at the same time.  MPS notifies Airmen who receive approved CJRs while in TDY or patient status. 3.6.  Actions Involving Retraining and Special Duty CJRs.  Eligible FTA may apply for FTA Retraining even if they have an approved CJR in their current skill or are on the CJR waiting list. 3.6.1.  MPS  must  notify  AFPC  Reenlistments  in  accordance  with  current  processing procedures (prior to reenlistment/extension) when individuals are selected for retraining.  Once notified, AFPC Reenlistments updates CJRs as follows: 3.6.1.1.  AFPC Reenlistments issues CJR in the retraining AFSC (reenlistment availability code  "B")  when  the  Airman  can  satisfy  the  retraining  retainability  requirement  by extending.    B-quota  Airmen  are  not  eligible  to  reenlist  in  the  retraining  AFSC  until completion of technical training and must meet the criteria in paragraph 5.11.2.  If the Airman received an approved Base of Preference (BOP) in conjunction with retraining, the Airman cannot reenlist in the retraining-in AFSC until successful completion of technical training.  (Note:  Eligible Airmen may reenlist in lieu of extending for retraining.  See paragraph 4.7.) 3.6.1.1.1.  If the Airman received an approved BOP in conjunction with retraining, the Airman must reenlist IAW AFI 36-2110, Assignments. Also see paragraph 4.6. (T-1). 3.6.1.2.  AFPC  Reenlistments  issues  retraining  CJR  in  the  current  AFSC  (reenlistment availability  code  "K")  when  the  Airman  cannot  satisfy  the  retraining  retainability requirement by extending their enlistment.  K-quota Airmen must reenlist within 45 days of CJR being issued and is not eligible to extend for the retainability.  See paragraph 4.7 for SRB eligibility. (T-1). 3.6.2.  Airmen may request a CJR in their current skills, as an exception to the normal CJR eligibility criteria (paragraph 3.1), if they were eliminated from retraining for reasons beyond their control or if the Air Force cancelled their retraining. 3.6.3.  Airmen who apply and are approved for a special duty assignment and who do not have a CJR, may apply for a CJR in the special duty or Reporting Identifier (RI) (8XXXX or 9F, 9L, 9R or 9S only).  If approved, the AFPC Reenlistments updates the CJR in the special duty AFSC. 3.7.  Processing CJR Exception to Policy (ETP) Request.  Ordinarily, Airmen in constrained AFSCs who were ineligible for a CJR during their CJR window will not have or be given another opportunity  to  compete/apply  for  a  CJR.    However,  AFPC  Reenlistments  will  consider  ETP requests when reasons beyond the member’s control (FTA who did not have their citizenship, pending Medical Evaluation Board [MEB], etc.) prevented them from being eligible for a CJR during their normal window.  The MPS assists the Airman in applying for a CJR as an ETP. 3.7.1.  Commander/civilian  directors  are  responsible  for  investigating  allegations  and disapproving unsubstantiated ETP requests.  Substantiated requests will be processed to the MPS.  The MPS processes the ETP to AFPC Reenlistments via normal processing procedures. AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 41 3.7.2.  If an ETP is approved by AFPC Reenlistments, the Airman will be given supplemental consideration and rank-ordered using their respective CJR window.  If a CJR is earned, the quota will be taken from the overall quota in that constrained AFSC and the MPS notified.  If the Airman did not rank high enough to earn a CJR, AFPC Reenlistments will advise the MPS.  The MPS advises the commander/civilian director of AFPC Reenlistments determination. 42 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 Chapter 4 SELECTIVE RETENTION BONUS (SRB) PROGRAM (APPLICABLE TO REGAF ONLY) 4.1.  Purpose  and  Application.  SRB  program  applies  to  Airmen  in  the  RegAF  and  is  not applicable to Air National Guard or AF Reserve Airmen.  SRB is a monetary incentive paid to Airmen  serving  in  certain  selected  critical  military  skills  who  reenlist  for  additional  obligated service.  The bonus is intended to encourage the reenlistment of sufficient numbers of qualified enlisted personnel in military skills with either demonstrated retention shortfalls or high training costs.  Airmen can expect to serve in the SRB specialty for the entire enlistment for which the bonus was paid.  The SRB program set forth in this Chapter is subject to authorization under 37 USC § 331 for such bonuses.  The combined CSRB and SRB received during a career cannot exceed $200,000, unless specifically authorized as an exception by the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (PDUSD [P&R]).  (Note:  SRB contracts may not  exceed  24  years  of  obligated  service  for  all  SRB  authorized  specialties  unless  otherwise directed by AF/A1.) 4.1.1.  Airmen do not qualify for the SRB if they reenlist or extend their enlistments for any purpose other than continued active service in the SRB skill. 4.1.2.  Reenlist IAW Table 5.2 for at least 3 years; or extend IAW Table 6.2, Rules 12, 13, 14, 16 and 29 (in one increment) in the RegAF for at least 36 months.  SRBs may be designated by AFSC, Zone, skill-level, grade, unit, or to meet other condition(s) as determined by the SecAF.    When  a  Zone  is  used  as  part  of  the  SRB  criteria,  the  Zone  is  determined  by  the Airman’s TAFMS at the time of reenlistment or date he/she enters the extension.  (Note:  The Airman’s pay grade on their DOE will be used to calculate the SRB.) 4.1.3.  Airmen  reenlisting/extending  in  Zone  E  incur  an  Active  Duty  Service  Commitment (ADSC) for a period equal to the term for which the SRB is paid.  Reference Table 4.1. 4.1.4.  The SRB multiple indicates the severity of the retention problem and the level of pay authorized to deal with the problem. 4.1.5.  Eligible Airmen may receive a SRB in each zone, but only one SRB per zone.  The maximum SRB payable is $90,000 per zone unless otherwise directed by AF/A1.  Eligible Airmen  may  receive  more  than  one  zone  at  the  same  time.    (Example:    An  Airman  who reenlists and receives a Zone A SRB then reenlists again prior to the Zone A SRB expiring and is eligible for a Zone B, the Airman would receive both payments until they receive the last Zone A authorization.) 4.2.  SRB-Eligible AFSCs  .  AF/A1P reviews each Air Force Specialty for award or adjustment of the SRB at least once per year.  (Note:  Reenlistments or extensions of any length executed prior to  the  effective  date  of  AF/A1  announcement  message  are  valid  and  are  not  be  cancelled  or declared  void  for  the  purpose  of  qualifying  for  a  SRB.)   Airmen  who  execute  a reenlistment/qualifying extension the same day as the effective date will not be entitled to the SRB. (T-1). 4.2.1.  AF/A1 may use one or more of the following criteria to designate SRB skills: AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 43 4.2.1.1.  Shortfalls in meeting current and projected retention objectives (retention rates and size of specific year groups, as well as adjacent year groups). 4.2.1.2.  Shortages in current and projected NCO (SSgt through MSgt) manning. 4.2.1.3.  High training investment and replacement cost for the skill. 4.2.1.4.  Expected improvement in retention resulting from designation as a SRB skill. 4.2.2.  AF/A1 announces SRB changes (increases, decreases, additions and deletions).  The effective date of any changes will be outlined in the releasing message/PSDG. 4.3.  General Eligibility Criteria. 4.3.1.  Airmen qualify for the SRB if they meet all the following: 4.3.1.1.  Are serving in the grade of A1C or higher. 4.3.1.2.  Are qualified and serving in a SRB skill in the appropriate zone and reflected on the current SRB authorized listing.  Both CASFC and Duty Air Force Specialty Control (DAFSC) must match SRB AFSC. (T-1). See Table 4.2 and paragraph 4.8. (Note:  The Airman must be performing [DAFSC] in the SRB AFSC and maintain a CAFSC in the SRB-AFSC. [T-1]. Any documents submitted with an unauthorized/erroneous SRB will require  reenlistment/extension  documents  to  be  re-accomplished.    Any  erroneously awarded SRB payments will be terminated and recouped.  Airmen not serving in the SRB skill are not entitled to future SRB payments.  This includes Airmen departing the AFSC on education programs.) (T-1). 4.3.1.3.  Are eligible to reenlist or extend. 4.3.1.4.  Reenlist for at least 3 years or extend their enlistments (in one increment) in the RegAF, without a break in service of more than 24 hours, for a period of at least 36 months. 4.3.1.5.  Extensions qualifying for a SRB begin payment on the day the extension is entered and SRB eligibility is based on the following: 4.3.1.5.1.  Zone is determined by the date the Airmen enters the extension. 4.3.1.5.2.  AFSCs and multiples in effect (by Zone) on the date extension is approved determine the amount of SRB.  Future  changes to SRB skills list do not affect the Airman’s SRB entitlements.  (Example:  If an Airman extends while serving in the Zone A window, but will be in the Zone B window on the day the extension is entered, the Airman receives a Zone B bonus, if a Zone B SRB is authorized.  Likewise, if an Airman extends while serving in Zone A, but will be in Zone B, and there is no Zone B authorization, the Airman would not qualify for a SRB). 4.3.1.5.3.  Have not previously received severance pay or separation pay. 4.3.2.  Airmen in Air Reserve components do not receive the SRB if they enlist in the RegAF, following discharge from the Reserves, during or at the end of an ADT period.

Break-in service Airmen may receive the SRB if they reenlist in the Air Force within 2 years  after  discharge  or  release  from  active  duty  (other  than  ADT).    If  authorized,  the entitlement is included on their enlistment contract executed at the point of accession. 4.3.4.  Former officers may receive the SRB if they reenlist in the RegAF within 3 months after release from active duty as officers, as long as they served as enlisted  Airmen just before serving  as officers.  They  must meet all other eligibility criteria. (T-1).   If  authorized, the entitlement is included on their enlistment contract executed at the point of accession. 4.4.  SRBs when applying for Commission  .  Airmen are not eligible for a SRB if they reenlist or enter an extension in order to get required retainability for a commissioning program after the selection date.  Airmen may be eligible for a SRB if they reenlist or enter an extension before the selection date.  In these cases, SRB payments do not occur, pending official selection or non-selection.  See paragraph 4.4.3. 4.4.1.  Airmen selected for a commissioning program and need retainability are not authorized the SRB. 4.4.2.  Airmen already receiving an SRB on their current enlistment are not eligible to apply for  a  commissioning  program  until  they  have  served  50%  of  the  SRB  contract.    Contract completion is determined from their DOE to the application due date. 4.4.2.1.  Airmen  departing  the  SRB  skill  will  have  their  SRB  remaining  payments terminated (if applicable) and any unearned portions of the SRB is recouped. 4.4.3.  Airmen who have not served 50% of their SRB contract must request an ETP in order to meet the board.  Request must be processed through the Airman’s unit commander/civilian director  to  AFPC  Reenlistments  prior  to  the  board  convening  date.    AFPC  Reenlistments forwards all requests to the Force Management Policy Division for approval/disapproval. 4.4.4.  Airmen  selected  for  a  commissioning  program  who  are  receiving  SRB  installment payments from a previous reenlistment/extension will have their SRB suspended/terminated effective one day prior to class start date of commissioning program. 4.4.4.1.  AFPC Officer Accessions will provide AFPC Reenlistments a class roster of all prior  service  commissioning  program  selectees  prior  to  each  Officer  Training  School (OTS) class start date.

The only ADSC waiver for retirement that is applicable is for “hardship” as stated in AFI 36-3203. (T-1). 4.5.  Special Conditions  .  Airmen with exactly 6 years of active duty on the date of reenlistment or beginning of an extension of enlistment are paid a Zone A bonus, if otherwise eligible and if they have not previously received a Zone A bonus.  If they have received a Zone A bonus or no Zone A bonus is designated, they may be paid a Zone B bonus if otherwise eligible.  Airmen with exactly 10 years of active duty on the date of reenlistment or beginning of an enlistment are paid a Zone B bonus if otherwise eligible and they have not received a Zone B bonus.  If they have received a Zone B bonus or no Zone B bonus is designated, they may be paid a Zone C bonus if otherwise eligible. 4.5.1.  Airmen who are in a special duty and who have an assignment back into their CAFSC may reenlist in the CAFSC and receive the SRB.  See paragraph 4.7. 4.5.2.  Airmen who are in SRB authorized AFSCs and are obtaining retainability for duties into any AFSC or special duty outside their SRB-AFSC are not authorized to reenlist in the SRB AFSC.  These Airmen reenlist in the special duty AFSC without SRB entitlement, if additional retainability is required or he/she may extend their enlistment to meet retainability requirements.  Airmen  must  complete  at  least  50  percent  of  their  enlistment  before  being considered/applying for release from the SRB AFSC. (T-1).  Airmen departing from SRB-AFSCs will have their remaining SRB payments terminated/recouped  IAW the DoDFMR.  Also see paragraph 4.12. (T-1). 4.6.  Eligibility for Retrainees (Voluntarily/Involuntarily) of SRB Skills and Developmental Special Duty (DSD)  .  Airmen attain SRB eligibility when they qualify for and serve in a SRB-designated skill.  When Airmen are selected for retraining and must reenlist in accordance with paragraph 3.6.1.2 or Second Term/Career Airmen reenlist to obtain retraining retainability, their CAFSCs and retraining-in AFSCs determine SRB eligibility and the multiple as indicated in Table 4.1. 4.6.1.  Voluntary Retraining.  Airmen receiving a SRB may volunteer as an ETP to retrain only if they are within the month they will complete at least 50% of their current enlistment, at the time of request.  No other requests will be considered.  AF/A1 is the approval authority for these types of requests.  There are several factors that will determine whether requests will be approved (manning, career field health, etc.).  If approved for retraining all unearned portions of the bonus will be recouped and all future/anniversary payments will be terminated.  AFPC Retraining  will  notify  AFPC  Reenlistments  via  current  processing  procedures  of  affected Airmen in order to initiate termination/recoupment actions through DFAS. (T-1). AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 47 4.6.2.  Involuntary Retraining.  AFPC Retraining will make every effort to prevent involuntary retraining for Airmen receiving a SRB.  Airmen who are involuntary retrained as a result of the  Noncommissioned  Officer  Retraining  Program  (NCORP)  are  not  required  to  repay unearned portions of a SRB.  However, they will not receive any future/anniversary payments.  AFPC  Retraining  will  notify  AFPC  Reenlistments  via  current  processing  procedures  of affected Airmen in order to initiate termination of future payments through DFAS. (T-1). 4.6.3.  Developmental Special Duty (DSD).  Airmen receiving a SRB must have completed 50%  of  their  current  enlistment  and  sign  a  memorandum  waiving  the  remaining  payment portion of the SRB to be considered for a DSD position.  Airmen who are selected for DSD will have their SRB terminated IAW the DoDFMR.  AFPC Assignments will notify AFPC Reenlistments  via  current  processing  procedures  of  affected  Airmen  in  order  to  initiate termination of future payments through DFAS.  (Exception:  Airmen who are selected for a DSD position within their career field retain future SRB payments.) 4.6.4.  Also see paragraph 4.11.2. Table 4.2.

Airmen approved for retraining or who are in a retraining status are only authorized the SRB multiple  in  effect  at  the  time  of  approved  retraining.    Airmen  whose  SRB  was  reduced  or terminated since approval for retraining must reenlist/extend (if authorized) on or  after the effective date outlined in the SRB releasing message.  They must be awarded the 3-skill level and enter upgrade training for the next higher skill level to qualify for the SRB multiple level in effect when he/she received final approval.  Failure to reenlist within the prescribed time period will result in loss of eligibility for the SRB at the previous multiple.  (Note:  The Airman must get retraining approval before the specialty termination or multiple reduction effective date, and the Airman must be in the same SRB zone on the date of reenlistment). (T-1).  2. Airmen will not normally be authorized to retrain out of the skill until they have completed the contract period for which they received the bonus. (T-1).  3. Airmen who received a SRB are identified by Assignment Limitation Code (ALC)-O.   4.7.  Eligibility  for  Airmen  in  Additionally  Awarded  SRB  Skills  (Including  Continental United States (CONUS)/Overseas Imbalanced SRB Skill into an awarded SRB Skill). 4.7.1.  Airmen  with  an  assignment  into  an  awarded  SRB  AFSC  (other  than  their  current CAFSC); or Airmen who are in a special duty and who have an assignment back into their SRB-CAFSC may reenlist in the SRB skill provided: 4.7.1.1.  Meet all reenlistment eligibility criteria. 4.7.1.2.  Receive official notification of an assignment into the SRB AFSC. 4.7.1.3.  Reenlist within 90 days of their departure date on Permanent Change of Station (PCS) or Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) into the SRB skill.  If they reenlist more than 90 days prior to departure, they will reenlist in their current CAFSC and receive the corresponding SRB and multiple (if applicable). 4.7.2.  Airmen may be eligible to delay obtaining required PCS or PCA retainability in order to qualify for the SRB IAW Table 6.2, Rule 12, if they have a DOS prior to 90 days before the PCS or PCA projected departure date and are otherwise eligible.  Also see AFI 36-2110. 4.7.3.  Airmen can expect to serve in the SRB skills for the entire period of the enlistment. 4.7.4.  Airmen  request  reenlistment  from  a  special  duty  back  into  their  CAFSC.    MPS processes requests according to the PSDG.  MPS also advises Airmen regarding eligibility, estimated bonus amount, bonus recoupment if not fulfilling the term of enlistment or if not maintaining technical qualification, and the possibility of changes to SRB skills and multiples throughout the year. AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 49 4.8.  Use of SRB Airmen  .  SRB recipients may not perform duty outside their SRB specialty for more than 90 consecutive days in a 360 day period or a combined total of 90 days within a 360 day period.  (Note:  This does not apply to deployment taskings.  Airmen in SRB skills may be tasked to deploy/fill non-SRB duties without SRB interruption.) 4.8.1.  Airmen  may  not  be  re-assigned/selected  to  duties  outside  the  SRB  skill  prior  to completing at least 50% of their reenlistment/extension.  Duties in the SRB skill are defined IAW the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory.  If selected for duties outside the SRB skill,  the  commander/civilian  director  will  notify  the  MPS  and  the  SRB  will  be terminated/recouped  IAW  the  DoDFMR.    The  MPS  initiates  a  Case  Management  System (CMS) case to AFPC Reenlistments, requesting the SRB be terminated and recouped.  AFPC Reenlistments reviews the case and request DFAS take appropriate action. 4.8.2.  SRB Airmen may perform additional duties as directed by their commander/civilian director.  Additional duties are those duties performed in addition to the Airman’s primary skill/duty and will not result in a change of AFSC or duty title. 4.9.  Computing SRB Awards  . 4.9.1.  Compute  all  SRB  award  amounts  using  one  month’s  base  pay,  times  the  years extending/reenlisting, times the SRB multiple.  The Airman’s base pay on date of discharge is used  to  calculate  the  SRB.    Therefore,  if  SSgt  Jones  was  promoted  on  1  May  2016  and reenlisted on 1 May 2016, the SRB would be calculated on his/her base pay for the rank of SrA. 4.9.2.  The MPS will verify the Airman’s SRB data (number of days to be paid, SRB multiple and Zone) is correct in the Master Military Pay Account within 10 calendar days after update and take all necessary actions to correct the SRB data.  The MPS will compute the approximate SRB  entitlement  and  consult  with  their  local  finance  office  as  needed.    If  entitlement  is over/underpaid, process the necessary case to AFPC Reenlistments for action. 4.10.  Method of Payment  . 4.10.1.  50% Lump Sum Payment with Annual Installments Option.  Unless otherwise stated by  AF/A1,  Airmen  receive  50%  of  their  SRB  at  reenlistment  and  the  remainder  in  equal anniversary payments as noted in Table 4.3. 4.10.2.  When offered by AF/A1 in the announcement message, Airmen receive up to 100% lump sum payment option with the remainder as outlined in the announcement message/PSDG. 4.10.3.  Airmen with a break in service (prior service) of more than 24 hours do not receive payment until 30 days after arrival at the first permanent duty station following reenlistment. 4.10.4.  Initial  payment:  Airmen  receive  the  percentage  designated  (per  the  releasing message/PSDG) of the total amount (less applicable taxes) on the reenlistment date or the day they enter an extension.  Airmen receive the remaining percentage of the SRB amount (less applicable taxes) in equal annual amounts on each anniversary of the initial payment for the term of the reenlistment or extension as listed in the announcement message/PSDG. 50 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 Table 4.3.

SRB Reduction or Termination Actions  . 4.11.1.  Airmen serving in SRB skills announced for a SRB reduction or termination must extend or reenlist before the effective date of change in order to receive the bonus. (T-1).  (Note:  Airmen may only reenlist if he/she has a service-directed reason or are within the reenlistment window as established by Air Force policy.) 4.11.2.  Airmen approved for retraining or who are in a retraining status are only authorized the SRB multiple in effect at the time of approved retraining.  Airmen whose SRB was reduced or terminated since approval for retraining must reenlist/extend (if authorized) on or after the effective date outlined in the SRB announcement message.  They must be awarded the 3-skill level and enter upgrade training for the next higher skill level to qualify for the SRB multiple level in effect when he/she received final approval for retraining. (T-1).  Failure to reenlist within  the  prescribed  time  period  results  in  loss  of  eligibility  for  the  SRB  at  the  previous multiple.  (Note:  The Airman must get retraining approval before the specialty termination or multiple reduction effective date and be in the same SRB zone on the date of reenlistment). (T-1). 4.11.3.  AF/A1 announces SRB reduction or termination actions. 4.11.4.  MPS contacts the Airman when the following situation(s) apply: 4.11.4.1.  Contact all Airman that have projected reenlistment with an effective date on or after the effective date of the SRB listing, verify the SRB multiple against the new listing to see if the SRB has changed. (T-1). 4.11.4.1.1.  For  each  AFSC  where  the  SRB  is  terminated  or  decreased,  contact  all Airmen who are projected for reenlistment and inform them of the changes and their options.  Correct the Airman’s AF Form 901, Reenlistment Eligibility Annex to DD Form 4, to remove the SRB authorization, when applicable. (T-1). 4.11.4.2.  For each AFSC where the SRB has increased or a SRB has been added and the reenlistment is on or after the increase effective date, the MPS notifies the Airman and  correct the Airman’s AF Form 901 to reflect the correct SRB multiple. 4.11.4.3.  If the SRB has changed, the SRB authorization currently on file in MilPDS must be deleted and a new authorization requested. (T-3). 4.11.4.4.  If  an  E63/E6C  has  been  accomplished,  process  an  E64/E6D  to  change  the projection on DFAS files after the SRB authorization has been changed in MilPDS. (T-3). AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 51 4.11.4.5.  If the Airman’s reenlistment consummated on DFAS files with an incorrect SRB entitlement,  process  the  correction  to  AFPC  Reenlistments  via  current  processing procedure. (T-3). 4.12.  Termination/Recoupment/Repayment  of  SRB  .   SRB  termination  also  requires recoupment of the percentage representing the unserved part of the additional obligated service.  Commander/civilian directors cannot authorize termination without recoupment.  Airmen must remain technically qualified for effective performance in the SRB skill and complete the full term of enlistment or extension of enlistment in the SRB skill. (T-1).  Failure to do so may result in termination and recoupment.  SRB termination/recoupment/repayment is processed as outlined in the DoDFMR Volume 7A, Chapter 2.  Recoupment determinations will be made on a case-by-case basis consistent with the criteria set forth DoDFMR Volume 7A, Chapter 2 for Airmen paid a bonus under this instruction. 4.13.  SRB  AFSC  Disqualification  .  Airmen  disqualified  from  SRB-authorized  AFSCs  have their future payments terminated and recouped, if applicable, IAW the DoDFMR Volume 7A, Chapter 2. (T-0).  4.13.1.  AFPC Classification refers all AFSC disqualification cases (AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel [Officer and Enlisted]) to AFPC Reenlistments for review/action. 4.13.2.  AFPC Reenlistments will review all cases and refer those with SRB-authorized AFSCs to  DFAS  for  termination  and  recoupment,  if  applicable  IAW  the  DoDFMR  Volume  7A, Chapter  2  (T-0).    AFPC  Reenlistments  refers  cases  back  to  AFPC  Classifications  when complete or if no SRB termination/recoupment action applies. 4.14.  Combat Zone Tax Exclusion  .  SRB payments (initial payment and annual installments) are not taxable for Airmen who reenlist or extend (36 or 48 months) in a month during which they qualify  for  combat  zone  tax  exclusion.    They  must  either  reenlist  or  extend  in  the  designated combat zone, or at another location during the same month in which they served in the designated combat zone.  If the Airman sells leave in conjunction with reenlistment, only leave days earned while in the deployed location are tax excluded. (T-0). 4.15.  Assignment Limitation Code (ALC)-O and SRBs  .  Second Term and Career Airmen serving in SRB skills must have a SRB updated in MilPDS prior to reenlisting. (T-1).  ALC-O does  not  update  on  Second  Term  or  Career  Airmen  unless  the  SRB  is  updated  prior  to  the reenlistment being updated.  Refer to the PSDG for update procedures.  (Note:  If this code is not updated,  future  actions  such  as  retraining,  commissioning  programs  and  approval  into  special duties are affected.) 4.16.  SRBs and Airmen Approved for Special Duty/Reporting Identifiers  .  Airmen are not eligible for a SRB if they reenlist or enter an extension in order to get required retainability for a special  duty  or  reporting  identifier.    (Note:    Airmen  in  SRB  AFSCs  with  approved  special duty/reporting identifier will reenlist in the CAFSC of the special duty/reporting identifier AFSC.) (T-1).    See  paragraph  4.8  for  Airmen  in  Additionally  Awarded  SRB  Skills  (Including CONUS/Overseas Imbalanced SRB Skill into an awarded SRB Skill).  (Note:  This paragraph does not apply to Reporting Identifier 9S000.) 4.17.  Eligible for SRB and Electing not to Accept an SRB  .  Airmen eligible for an SRB on their current enlistment or eligible extension may elect not to accept the SRB designated for that reenlistment/extension.  Airmen who elect not to accept the SRB must complete the applicable 52 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 Section of the AF Form 901 or AF Form 1411.  The decision not to accept the SRB is irrevocable once the AF Form 901 or AF Form 1411 has been approved by the commander/civilian leader and accepted for reenlistment/extension of enlistment by the MPS representative.  No exceptions will be considered. 4.18.  Selective Retention Bonus (SRB) Roster.  The MPS Career Development Section receives a SRB Roster from the PSM NLT the 1st of each month. This roster identifies Airmen who have an ALC-O in-system and are receiving a SRB and notifies the commander/civilian director of those Airmen who must be performing SRB-related duties. 4.18.1.  The MPS sends SRB rosters monthly to the respective CSS for review/validation and unit commander/civilian director review/signature. 4.18.2.  Commander/civilian director reviews the SRB roster to consider whether Airmen are performing  SRB-related  duties.    See  para  4.8.1.    If  an  Airman  is  determined  to  not  be performing SRB duties, the unit will forward the necessary documentation to the MPS for SRB termination and recoupment actions, if necessary.  Commander/civilian director returns the SRB roster to the MPS as suspensed. 4.18.3.  The MPS will review the SRB roster and take action as required. AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 53 Chapter 5 REENLISTMENTS 5.1.  General  Instructions.  Reenlistment  in  the  Regular  Air  Force,  Air  Force  Reserve  or  Air National Guard is a command prerogative and is not an inherent right of any individual.  Airman not  selected  for  reenlistment  via  SRP  will  not  be  reenlisted  but  may  qualify  for  extension  of enlistment. 5.2.  SRP Reconsideration.  SRP reconsiderations are accomplished by unit commander/civilian directors prior to a member’s ETS/DOS. 5.2.1.  Reenlistment may be limited based on the needs of individual service components. 5.2.2.  The MPS will (T-1): 5.2.2.1.

Commander/civilian directors ensure ceremonies are conducted in a dignified and professional manner, appropriate for an official act in a place that provides reverence to the oath being taken; safety of all participants should also be paramount. 5.3.1.  Airmen may request any commissioned officer (RegAF, AFR, ANG or retired) in the U.S. Armed Forces to perform the ceremony and may invite guests.  Reenlistments can be conducted on any day of the year.  The reenlistee and the officer administering the oath have traditionally had the U.S. flag forming a backdrop for the oath. (T-0). 5.3.2.  The  reenlistee  and  reenlisting  officer  must  wear  an  authorized  uniform  for  the ceremony.  (T-1).  (Exception:    The  uniform  requirement  is  optional  for  retired  officers.) 54 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 Airmen  and  reenlisting  officials  may  not  conduct  a  reenlistment  in  the Air  Force  physical training uniform. 5.4.  Who  May  Administer  the  Oath  of  Enlistment  .    The  oath  may  be  taken  before  the President, the Vice-President, the Secretary of Defense, any commissioned officer, or any other person designated under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.  RegAF, AFR, ANG or retired commissioned officers of the U.S. Armed Forces may administer the oath.  Officers who resigned  their  commissions  and  transferred  to  the  Obligated  Reserve  Section  (ORS)  or  the Nonaffiliated Reserve Section (NARS) may not administer the oath.  (Exception:  Commissioned warrant officers in the grade of CW2, CW3 and CW4 may also administer the oath.) 5.5.  Processing and Place of Reenlistment  .  Airmen must reenlist at their home station unless they are absent due to deployment, hospitalization or are in a pipeline status (school, overseas returnee, etc.). (T-1).  Airmen must be present for duty and cannot reenlist while on leave, while in a separation status or after departing their unit of assignment on terminal leave for separation. (T-1). (Example:  If SSgt Smith is reenlisting on 15 Feb 2015, he must not be in a leave status on 15 Feb 2015.)  (Note: Airmen returning from a leave status may not reenlist the next day following their leave.  Airmen who have been determined to be in a leave status at the time of reenlistment must execute a new reenlistment/contract when not on leave.) 5.5.1.  MPS gives Airmen departing on deployment a reenlistment package if they desire to reenlist and their ETS or DOS expires while deployed.  The package includes documents listed in Table 5.1. (T-1). 5.5.1.1.  The home station MPS: 5.5.1.1.1.  Obtains the Airman’s signature on all appropriate documents. 5.5.1.1.2.  Coordinates  with  the  MPS  at  the  deployed  location  to  ensure  proper completion of the reenlistment documents. 5.5.2.  The MPS/PERSCO at the deployed location: 5.5.2.1.  Provides the Airman their copy of reenlistment contract, if more than 30 calendar days will expire between the reenlistment date and the date the Airman will return to home station. 5.5.2.2.  Forward all remaining copies to the home station MPS for final processing. 5.6.  Reenlistment of Non-U.S. Citizens  .  Non-U.S. citizens, enlisting on or after 1 November 1982, must become U.S. citizens during their initial enlistment before they are eligible to reenlist. (T-0).  Airmen may be eligible to extend under paragraph 6.6.5.4 (Applies to RegAF and AFR only). (T-0).  Citizens of Micronesia and Palau may be eligible for reenlistment even if they do not have their citizenship.  These cases will be worked through AFPC Reenlistments to Air Staff for approval. (T-0). 5.7.  Informed  Decision  (ID)  Program  .    The  CAA  at  every  installation  will  publicize  and conduct an ID seminar. (T-2).  This seminar is an educational experience specifically designed to enhance one’s knowledge of Air Force benefits, highlight program requirements and processes.  All RegAF first term and second term Airmen are required to attend unless pending involuntary separation. (T-2).  Reserve Component Airmen are counseled prior to reenlistment.  See AFI 36-2624,  The  Career  Assistance  Advisor,  First  Term  Airmen  Center  and  Enlisted  Professional Enhancement Programs. AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 55 5.8.  Reenlistment of Sole Surviving Sons or Daughters.  Airmen who qualify as sole surviving sons or daughters waive any right to claim discharge or assignment limitations as sole surviving sons or daughters upon their reenlistment.  They may request reinstatement of their sole survivor status  through  assignments  at  any  time.    If  approved,  they  may  again  qualify  for  assignment limitation, but not for discharge or release from active duty. 5.9.  Erroneous Enlistment/Reenlistment Documents Returned for Correction.  There are two types  of  erroneous  reenlistment  documents.    The  first  consists  of  contractual  errors  made  in violation of this publication, such as the reenlistment of ineligible Airmen or Airmen not issued a CJR.    The  second  is  administrative,  involving  typographical  errors,  strikeovers,  misspellings, erroneous computation of required retainability or SRB, etc. 5.9.1.  Contractual Errors.  Airmen not authorized to reenlist or in violation of this AFI (no CJR, not meeting Time in Service/Time in Grade ineligible RE code, etc.) will have their contract voided.  AFPC Reenlistments (AFRC/A1K for AFR, ARPC/DPT for IMA and PIRR, and NGB/A1PP for ANG), directs the MPS to void the contract and take action as needed to remove any documentation from all systems of record. (T-1). 5.9.2.  Administrative Errors.  MPS will not correct administrative errors discovered in items 2, 5, 8, 18b, 19b and 19f of the DD Form 4. (T-1). Administrative errors in these items will necessitate  the  deletion  and  re-creation  of  the  DD  Form  4.    Also  see  paragraph  5.9.4.3.1.  Administrative errors may be corrected on the AF Form 901, if the Airman and Air Force agree.  However,  any  unauthorized/erroneous  SRB  necessitates  re-accomplishment  of  the document(s) and are terminated and recouped.  If the corrections were made on the forms, stamp “CORRECTED COPY” in the upper margin of the corrected pages, ensure the Airman initials the corrected area(s), and make a photocopy of the corrected forms for the Airman.  The  MPS  corrects  MilPDS  and  Defense  Joint  Military  Pay  System-  Active  Component (DJMS-AC), as appropriate and distributes the documents IAW Table 5.10. 5.9.3.  AFPC Reenlistments will direct the AF Form 901 be corrected to reflect the authorized SRB  in  cases  where  an  SRB  was  not  properly  documented  on  the  contract  or  direct  an unauthorized SRB entitlement be removed from the AF Form 901. 5.9.4.  Documents Returned to MPS for Correction(s).  AFPC Reenlistments returns enlistment contracts to servicing Chief, MPSs for correction. (Example:  Missing signatures, when dates do not match reenlistment date on DD Form 4 and/or AF Form 901, incomplete contracts, missing  pages,  or  incomplete  forms,  etc.)    The  MPS  makes  appropriate  corrections  to  the contract(s) and returns the contracts and transmittal to AFPC Reenlistments by the established suspense.  Also see paragraph 5.9.2. 5.9.4.1.  The  Airman  and  the  MPS  representatives  must  initial  each  correction.  (T-1).  Stamp “CORRECTED COPY” in the upper margin of the corrected pages.  Make a photo copy of the corrected forms and comply with the disposition instructions in Table 5.10. 5.9.4.2.  Do  not  make  corrections  to  the  form  stamped  “DO  NOT  CORRECT  THIS COPY” unless there is no ARMS copy and the Airman does not have a copy. 5.9.4.2.1.  In those situations, correct the copy stamped “DO NOT CORRECT THIS COPY” and type “Only Available Copy” in the upper margin of the corrected pages.  Make a photo copy of the corrected forms and comply with the disposition instructions in Table 5.10. 56 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 5.9.4.3.  Reaccomplish the DD Form 4/1 and AF Form 901 if there is no ARMS copy or the Airman does not have a copy.  (Note:  The Airman’s current commander or civilian director holding the position will sign the corrected form(s) and the current date is used.) (T-1). 5.9.4.3.1.  If contract is reaccomplished, stamp “RECONSTRUCTED COPY” in the upper margin of the new contract.  The forms are dated using the current date and signed by the Airman’s current commander/civilian director.  Make a photo copy of the corrected forms and comply with the disposition instructions in Table 5.10.  (Note:  Commanders or civilian directors may not refuse to re-accomplish these documents or deny reenlistment.) 5.9.4.3.2.  The MPS sends the original documents to AFPC Reenlistments for review as outlined in Table 5.10 and corrects MilPDS and DJMS-AC, as appropriate. 5.10.  Oath of Enlistment.  All Airmen enlisting or reenlisting must take the oath of enlistment: (T-1). “I,  (State  your  full  name),  do  solemnly  swear  (or  affirm)  that  I  will  support  and  defend  the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.” 5.10.1.  All Airmen have the choice to make the words “So help me God” optional in the enlistment oaths (both orally and written). 5.10.1.1.  Airmen  who  make  a  choice  to  “affirm”  the  oath  of  office/oath  of  enlistment and/or omit the words “So help me God” may also line through the words “swear” and/or the words “So help me God.” 5.11.  Reenlistment in the Regular Air Force (RegAF). 5.11.1.  Once an Airman has reenlisted, they must initial next to the lined text, as applicable, and sign the DD Form 4.  A reenlistment is considered executed once the Airman has been approved to reenlist (AF Form 901), the enlistee has taken the oath of enlistment, and both the reenlistee and administering officer have signed the DD Form 4.  (T-0). 5.11.2.  Eligibility. 5.11.2.1.  RegAF Airmen may be eligible to reenlist if they meet all of the requirements: (T-0). 5.11.2.2.  Are eligible for immediate reenlistment according to Table 5.3. 5.11.2.3.  Can fill a specific requirement in their skill or another skill through retraining. 5.11.2.4.  Are selected by their commander/civilian director under the SRP (refer to 2.6.). 5.11.2.5.  Meet a condition listed in Table 5.9. 5.11.2.6.  To qualify for an SRB is not a reason to reenlist. 5.11.3.  In addition to the above basic eligibility criteria, FTA may reenlist if they have an approved CJR IAW Table 5.9. AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 57 Table 5.2.  FTA, Second-Term/Career Airmen Reenlistments. ITEM   A   B  the Airman may reenlist  If the Airman is eligible and is a 1  2  3 4 First Term,  4-year enlistee  First Term,  6-year enlistee  FTA may reenlist in a retraining status Second Term and Career Airmen after completing 36 consecutive months on the current enlistment if the Airman has an approved CJR. A prior service Airman is considered FTA when the prior active service is less than 24 months.  See notes 1 and 2.  after completing 60 consecutive months on the current enlistment if the Airman has an approved CJR. See notes 1 and 2. See items 1 and 2 above, complete retraining and possess the 3-skill level in the new AFSC.  See notes 1 and 2. provided they possess another awarded AFSC with a skill level commensurate with their current grade in order to reenlist in the retraining AFSC at the 3-skill level, be within the current reenlistment window as established by Air Force policy or have a service directed reason.  See notes 1 and 2. Notes:  1. Airmen must project reenlistments NLT 120 days prior to their DOS or they are projected for separation. (T-1). 2.  The MPS will project all reenlistments in-system upon receipt of approved AF Form 901, or  no  later  than  120  days  before  DOS,  whichever  comes  first.  (T-1).    Failure  to  project reenlistments automatically causes MilPDS to project the Airman for separation, and cancels other  personnel  actions.    The  MPS  will  refer  to  the  PSDG  for  procedures  for  projecting reenlistments and requesting CJR/SRB authorizations. (T-1).  (Note:  AFR and ANG personnel are not authorized to enlist, reenlist, or extend under this section unless recalled to Extended Active Duty under 10 USC § 12301 voluntary or involuntary recall.  Enlisted personnel who wish to apply under 10 USC § 12301(d), voluntary recall, must apply through AFPC Enlisted Accessions. (T-1).  EAD orders indicate recall authority.  Contact AFPC Enlisted Accessions for guidance and instructions or refer to AFI 36-2002, Regular Air Force and Special Category Accessions). 5.11.4.  Term of Enlistment (TOE).  The minimum TOE is four years unless the Airman has more than 24 months of obligated service.  Under no circumstances can the reenlistment, along with combined obligated service exceed 72 months or exceed the Airman’s HYT plus 1 month.    (Exception: Enlisted Airmen who have been selected to enter the United States Air Force Enlisted Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Pilot Program and attend the Undergraduate RPA Training (URT) course may reenlist for a period of 8 years.  Airmen reenlisting under this exception may not execute a reenlistment, along with combined obligated service to exceed 96 months.) 5.11.4.1.  Airmen do not have the option to add  additional months or  reduce obligated service  to  the  reenlistment  contract  (refer  to  Table  5.8.,  Terms  of  Reenlistment).  Regardless of the number of years authorized, a reenlistee’s new DOS must exceed the previous DOS. (T-1).  (Note:  An Airman may only reenlist for 6 years if they are within 58 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 29 calendar days of DOS.  Similarly, Airmen can reenlist for 5 years only if they have 12 months or less of obligated service). 5.11.4.1.1.  If an Airman has between 25 and 36 months of remaining obligated service, they can reenlist for 3 years plus obligated service. 5.11.4.1.2.  Airmen reenlisting who are HYT restricted may not exceed their HYT plus 1 month.  Airmen will be separated on their HYT date.  For Airmen who are eligible for an SRB, their SRB will be calculated based only on TOE years (a minimum of 3 years).  If the TOE is less than 3 years, the Airman is ineligible for an SRB.  Also see Table 5.8. 5.11.4.2.  Annotate the TOE on the DD Form 4/1, Section 8 to reflect the TOE in years and months.    (Note:    The  MPS  must  line  through  “weeks”  and  type  in  “months.”  (T-1).  Annotate  the  number  of  months  (obligated  service)  to  satisfy  the  full  enlistment.    The Airman will initial the change to the reenlistment document.) 5.11.4.3.  Obligated service. Include remaining obligated service (in excess of 29 calendar days) into the reenlistment. (T-1). 5.11.4.3.1.  Obligated service is that time in excess of 29 calendar days from the Date of Enlistment (DOE) to the DOS.  Any partial month of 29 calendar days or less is not considered in the total obligated service.  Obligated service will be listed on the contract in the months of the TOE.  Therefore, if an Airman has 1 year and 2 months of obligated service, the DD Form 4 will reflect 14 in Section 8 to reflect the 14 months of obligated service. 5.11.4.3.2.  Airmen who cannot reenlist to their HYT may be eligible to extend under Table 6.2, Rule 27. 5.11.4.4.  Constructive Reenlistment.  The Chief, Sustainment and Transition Operations Division,  Air  Force  Personnel  Center  is  delegated  authority  to  approve  a  constructive reenlistment when determined a constructive reenlistment is appropriate (i.e., for Airmen to reach his/her HYT) under the authority of 10 USC § 1552 (a) (2) without consideration by the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records. (DODD 1332.41, Boards for Correction of Military Records [BCMRs] and Discharge Review Boards [DRBs]; 10 USC § 1552.) 5.11.4.4.1.  Airmen submit these requests through their commander/civilian director to their MPS for processing to AFPC Reenlistments for review and further processing. 5.11.4.4.2.  For example:  I request a constructive reenlistment to obtain 13 months retainability to retire at my HYT.  I am ineligible to reenlist based on HYT and I cannot extend since I have already extended 42 months of the 48-month maximum. 5.11.4.5.  Airmen scheduled for reenlistment within 7 calendar days of their DOS must complete the following statement during reenlistment processing (T-1): "I intend to reenlist immediately after separation.  I hereby authorize my retention in service for a period not to exceed 7 calendar days beyond my date of separation (DOS), to complete separation processing,  should  I,  immediately  before  or  after  separation,  and  before  reenlistment, decline to reenlist."  Retain this statement with the reenlistment package until reenlistment occurs.  Airmen may not request reenlistment once they enter the 7-calendar day extension AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 59 period; this extension is for separation processing only.  Do not complete AF Form 1411 for this extension, and do not complete this statement for Airmen scheduled to reenlist more than 7 calendar days before their DOS. 5.11.5.  FTA/NCORP Retrainees.  Airmen who retrained under FTA Retraining/NCORP may request cancellation of an extension obtained for retraining that has not been entered contingent upon immediate reenlistment.  Airmen must be reenlistment eligible IAW paragraph 5.11.2 and may only request cancellation of the extension within 30 days after class graduation date. (T-1). Exception: FTA who are not reenlistment eligible IAW para 5.11.2 and Table 5.2 may submit  an  ETP  to  have  their  request  granted  and  must  do  so  within  90 days  of  becoming reenlistment eligible.  Upon approval, the Airman must reenlist within the next 30 days.  All other extensions will be considered as obligated service, see para 5.11.2 and Table 5.2 for reenlistment eligibility.  (Note:  Extension cancellation and reenlistment must occur the same date.) (T-1). 5.11.5.1.  The MPS will: 5.11.5.1.1.  Ensure extension has not been entered and the cancellation is within 30 days after class graduation. (T-1). 5.11.5.1.2.  Ensure  only  the  extension  authorized  for  FTA/NCORP  retraining  is cancelled. (T-1). (Example 1:  Airman extends 23 months for FTA/NCORP retraining; all 23 months may be forgiven if not entered.)  (Example 2:  Airman extends 7 months for an assignment and 16 months for FTA retraining, only the 16 months for FTA retraining could be forgiven if not entered.) 5.11.5.1.3.  Complete the AF Form 1411-1, Cancellation of Extensions of Enlistment in the Air Force. (T-1). 5.11.5.1.4.  Project the reenlistment in MilPDS and cancel the extension upon receipt of completed reenlistment documents. (T-1). 5.11.5.1.5.  Extensions  obtained  for  FTA/NCORP  retraining  that  have  been  entered will not be forgiven and will be considered as obligated service. (T-1).  Airmen will reenlist based on the criteria set forth in this instruction as stated in Chapter 5. (T-1). 5.11.6.  Reenlistment Documents.  Airmen completing/executing the forms listed in Table 5.1 formally document a reenlistment and those documents represent a legally binding contract between the Air Force and reenlistee.  The MPS completes the DD Form 4/1 IAW DODI 1304.2, Accession Processing Data Collection Forms and this instruction.  The AF Form 901 will be completed IAW the Reenlistment PSD Guide.  Incomplete or inaccurate documents are returned  to  the  Airman’s  servicing  MPS  for  corrections  and  can  result  in  an  erroneous reenlistment agreement, possible loss of payment of SRB entitlement, etc.  Any documents submitted  with  an  unauthorized  or  erroneous  SRB  will  require  the  reenlistment/extension documents to be re-accomplished.  Any erroneously awarded SRB payments will be terminated and recouped. 5.11.6.1.  Special care must be taken to ensure all items are completed correctly without errors. White-out or correction tape or fluid will not be used on these forms.  Corrections in items 2, 5, 8, 18b, 19b and 19f require a new DD Form 4 to be accomplished. (T-1). 60 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 5.11.6.2.  The forms can only be signed in black, blue, or blue-black ink when completed manually (non-digitally signed). 5.11.6.3.  Only the Airman’s home station unit commander/civilian director completes the AF Form 901.  (Exception:  Section Commanders on G-series orders may also sign.) 5.11.7.  Reenlistment Agreements.  The MPS documents only approved/authorized Air Force reenlistment agreements on AF Form 901.  (Note:  All reenlistment agreements are identified on the AF Form 901.  If the Airman has no reenlistment agreement(s), the MPS will mark the block indicating no reenlistment agreement(s). (T-1). 5.11.7.1.  The MPS must authorize only the following guarantees on AF Form 901: (T-1). 5.11.7.1.1.  Approved retraining. 5.11.7.1.2.  Approved  Airman  for  training  program  that  leads  to  an  Air  Force commission. 5.11.7.1.3.  Approved Base of Preference (BOP) or in-place BOP (for FTA only). 5.11.7.1.4.  Other  approved  agreements  authorized  by  current  AF/A1.    (Note:    The MPS will specify the approved agreement in the area provided.) (T-1). 5.11.8.  Discharge  for  the  Purpose  of  Immediate  Reenlistment.    Discharge  always  occurs before Airmen reenlist.  The discharge will remain in effect if the Airman does not reenlist within  24  hours.    MPS  will  not  give  the  completed  AF  Form  901  to  the  Airman  until reenlistment occurs. (T-1). Do not use the AF Form 901 for prior service enlistments or for former  officer  entering  the  Air  Force  in  enlisted  status.    (Note:    Commanders  or  civilian directors holding the position may not refuse to sign AF Form 901, and then permit Airman to remain otherwise eligible for reenlistment.  In such cases commander/civilian directors will immediately notify the MPS of the specific circumstances in writing and submit the required documentation (AF Form 418, etc.) within 7 calendar days.) (T-1). 5.11.8.1.  The AF Form 901 documents the commander’s/civilian director’s approval to reenlist and also documents discharge for the purpose of immediate reenlistment. 5.11.8.2.  The Chief, MPS or designated representative authenticates the AF Form 901. (T-1).    The  designated  representatives  must  be  assigned  to  the  MPS  or  Geographically Separated Unit (GSU) personnel function and in the grade of TSgt, GS-06, or higher, and act  as reenlistment  and  validate/confirm eligibility/entitlements. (T-2). 5.11.8.3.  MPS ensures the commander or civilian director holding the position documents certification on AF Form 901. Airmen will not be provided the DD Form 4 without an approved/signed AF Form 901 from the commander/civilian director.  (Note:  DD Form 256AF, Honorable Discharge Certificate, is not be issued to Airmen to be discharged for the purpose of immediate reenlistment within 24 hours.) representative the  service for the 5.11.9.  Leave Settlement.  Airmen may sell a maximum of 60 days accrued leave during their career.    Accrued  leave  may  be  sold  and  paid  upon  reenlistment  or  entering  into  the  first extension of enlistment, to include subsequent reenlistments.  MPS refers to AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, and the PSDG for DJMS-AC update instructions, as applicable. 5.11.9.1.  Airmen may change their leave settlement election provided: AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 61 5.11.9.1.1.  Airmen  reenlisting  must  change  their  election  before  they  reenlist  and document their change on an AF Form 1089, Leave Settlement Option.  All Airmen are counseled prior to reenlistment. (T-0). 5.11.10.  Airmen  reenlisting  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  an  Air  Force  commission.  Publications  governing  selection  for  a  program  leading  to  an  Air  Force  commission  take precedence over reenlistment restrictions imposed by this publication. 5.11.10.1.  Airmen may reenlist to obtain service retainability required for the particular commissioning program.  This includes FTA who have not completed 36 months TAFMS on their current enlistment (60 months for 6-year enlistees). 5.11.10.2.  MPS  updates  RE  code  3A  for  FTA  selected  for  Air  Force  commissioning programs who have not reached the SRP consideration point.  MPS updates RE code 1J for all other Airmen selected for commissioning programs.  (Note:  MPS cannot update RE code 1J or 3A until the Airman is projected for separation). 5.11.10.3.  Refer to paragraph 4.4 for restrictions pertaining to Airmen serving in SRB skills. 5.11.11.  Identifying and Notifying Reenlistment-Ineligible Airmen.  MPS uses the SRP roster to identify First Term, Second Term and Career Airmen ineligible to reenlist.  MPS sends the commander/civilian director a monthly list of ineligible Airmen for informational purposes only. 5.11.12.  HYT and Age 60 Restrictions.  The reenlistment terms outlined in Table 5.9 prevent Airmen from violating the HYT and age 60 restrictions discussed below. Requests for HYT adjustments, waivers or corrections will be sent to AFPC Retirements via current processing procedures. (Note:  Under no circumstances will any reenlistment or extension exceed the month following Airman's HYT or age 60, whichever occurs first.) 5.11.12.1.  Airmen may not reenlist or extend their enlistment if the new DOS exceeds the month following their 60th birthday.  If approved, the reenlistment or extension period may not exceed the month following the HYT for the Airman's grade, or age 60, whichever occurs first.  (Exception:  Airmen may reenlist for a period that permits them to serve at least 20 years TAFMS, but they may not exceed the age 60 restriction.) 5.11.12.2.  First Term Airmen may not reenlist if the new DOS will exceed their HYT plus 1 month.  Also see paragraph 5.11.12.2.2.  However, they may qualify for an extension of enlistment to establish a DOS at HYT (refer to paragraph 6.6.9 and Table 6.2). 5.11.12.2.1.  SSgts  may  not  reenlist  if  the  new  DOS  will  exceed  their  HYT  plus  1 month.  Also see paragraph 5.11.12.2.2. However, they may qualify for an extension of enlistment to establish a DOS at HYT (refer to paragraph 6.6.9.1 and Table 6.2). 5.11.12.2.2.

Airmen in the grade of TSgt authorized to receive a Zone E SRB, may reenlist  for  periods  exceeding  their  HYT  plus  1  month,  provided  the  reenlistment 62 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 authorizes the Airman the Zone E SRB and does not establish a DOS exceeding 22 years TAFMS.  See Table 4.1, item 4 for additional eligibility criteria. 5.11.12.2.4.  CSRB.  For Airmen authorized a CSRB, the HYT may be waived at the discretion of the SecAF or designated representative. AFPC will adjust the HYT after the CSRB contract is processed. 5.11.12.3.  Airmen with at DOS that exceeds HYT due to HYT reduction, demotion, etc. will  have  their  DOS  adjusted  to  match  their  new  HYT  date.    Before  beginning  any separation  package,  consult  AFI  36-3208,  Administrative  Separation  of  Airmen.    The separation authority may withhold execution of a separation for any reason in the best interest of the Air Force. (T-1). 5.11.13.  Reduction to HYT grades: 5.11.13.1.  Airmen subsequently promoted or whose HYT has been extended will execute a new contract to meet future retainability requirements.  The previous contract will not be re-instated. 5.11.13.2.  Airmen receiving an SRB will receive their full entitlement, provided they have executed a new reenlistment/extension and serve in the same SRB skill. 5.11.14.  Reenlistment of Non-U.S. Citizens.  Non-U.S. citizens who obtain U.S. citizenship will be assigned an RE code and must have SRP consideration completed to remove the RE code and reenlist. (T-0).  Non-U.S. citizens who fail to obtain U.S. citizenship during their initial enlistment will separate with the applicable RE code. (T-0). 5.11.15.  Air  Force  Fitness  Program,  Airmen  Medically  Disqualified  and  Airmen  in  RI 9A000/9A100/9A200/9A300.    Commander/civilian  directors  may  review  and  determine reenlistment eligibility for Airmen who have a first time fitness failure and will review and determine reenlistment eligibility for all Airmen who remain in the Unsatisfactory category after  two  or  more  tests  within  24  months  (IAW  AFI  36-2905,  Fitness  Program).   Commanders/civilian  directors  may  place  Airmen  in  the  Unsatisfactory  category  in reenlistment  eligibility  4J  by  completing  the  AF  Form  418  and  stating  “Airman  in Unsatisfactory fitness category, is reenlistment ineligible and placed in RE code 4J.”  (T-1). 5.11.15.1.  Successfully  reaching  a  Satisfactory  or  Excellent  fitness  category  does  not automatically  restore  reenlistment  eligibility.    The  commander/civilian  director  may remove the reenlistment ineligibility condition by completing an AF Form 418 after the Airman  successfully  transitions  to  a  Satisfactory  or  Excellent  fitness  category,  or  the commander/civilian  director  may  choose  to  continue  the  reenlistment  ineligibility  until after the Airman receives a second consecutive Satisfactory or Excellent fitness assessment score at which time an AF Form 418 will be completed removing the Airman’s 4J – Fitness Failure  reenlistment  ineligibly  code.  An  ineligible  Airman  (RE  code  4J)  requiring retainability  to  reach  the  Satisfactory  or  Excellent  fitness  category  may  request  an extension of enlistment according to Table 6.2, Rule 18.  If eligibility for reenlistment is denied, Airman will be placed in RE Code 2X and is not eligible to extend or reenlist (except to appeal the non-selection).  If the Airman is later made reenlistment eligible, then the commander/civilian director will complete an AF Form 418 and the MPS or equivalent updates the RE code to a more applicable code. (T-1).  Refer to AFI 36-2905 for additional information. AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 63 5.11.15.2.  Airmen in RE code 4K may not reenlist when pending evaluation by a MEB or PEB unless waiver is approved.  See Table 5.7, Item 2. 5.11.15.2.1.  Airmen  in  RE  code  4K  may  voluntarily  extend  their  enlistment  under Table 6.2, Rule 9 of this AFI.  Limit extensions to a period outlined by AFPC Medical Standards, not to exceed a maximum 24 months.  See Chapter 6. 5.11.15.3.  All Airmen disqualified from their AFSC and in RI of 9A000, 9A100, 9A200 or  9A300  are  updated  to  RE  code  4G.    Commander/civilian  directors  may  not  waive Airmen in RE code 4G to permit reenlistment unless the Airman has been selected and approved for retraining or Special Duty.  In these cases the commander/civilian director takes action as outlined in paragraph 2.6.7 through 2.6.11. 5.11.15.3.1.  Airmen disqualified and in RI 9A000 or 9A100 may execute a one-time extension  in  order  to  remain  on  active  duty  for  a  total  period  of  12  months  to qualify/compete  for  retraining/Special  Duty.    Under  no  circumstances  can  the extension period combined with the remaining obligated service exceed 12 months.  The length of the extension, if any is based on the date of the formal disqualification approval not to exceed 12 months.  Airmen will extend IAW Table 6.2, Rule 28d of this AFI. (T-1).  If the Airman is not approved for retraining or Special Duty during this period, he/she separates on his/her DOS. 5.11.15.3.2.  Airmen in RI 9A200/9A300 remain in RE code 4G and separate on DOS unless  the  commander/civilian  director  initiates  early  separation  or  subsequently completes retention versus separation package and retain the Airman. 5.11.16.  Waiver of Reenlistment Ineligibility Conditions (Lost Time and Civilian Criminal Court Convictions).  (Applies to AFR and ANG members when in an active status.)  Airmen may request waivers to reenlist to their unit commander/civilian director because they have 5 or more days lost time, or have a civil court conviction (Table 5.6, item 5 or 13).  (Note:  Civil court  convictions  automatically  render  Airmen  ineligible  for  the  length  of  the  maximum allowable Manual for Courts Martial [MCM] confinement period for the same or most closely related offenses.  The MPS must contact the servicing legal office to determine the MCM confinement period.) (T-1). 5.11.16.1.  Airmen  must  request  a  waiver  to  reenlist.    The  Airman’s  supervisor  will complete an AF Form 418.  See paragraphs 2.6.7 through 2.6.11 for processing the AF Form 418. (T-1). 5.11.16.1.1.  If the waiver is  approved, the  commander/civilian director  ensures the Airman  acknowledges  receipt,  and  then  sends  the  AF  Form  418  to  the  MPS  for processing.  The MPS updates RE code 1A (can only be updated immediately before Airman reenlists or extends), documents the waiver reason/authority on the AF 901, and attaches the waiver to the contract for file in ARMS. 5.11.16.1.1.1.  When  Airmen  receive  approved  waivers  and  reenlist, reenlistment ineligibility condition no longer applies. 5.11.16.1.1.2.  When Airmen receive approved waivers to extend their enlistment, the MPS will re-update the ineligibility conditions after updating the extension.  Waivers are only valid for one extension. the 64 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 5.11.16.1.1.3.  When Airmen elect separation after receiving approved waivers, the MPS re-update the ineligibility condition, unless a higher priority code applies. 5.11.16.2.  If disapproved, the commander/civilian director ensures Airman acknowledges receipt.  The Airman may elect to appeal the disapproval decisions.  Process the appeal as outlined in paragraph 2.6.13 through 2.6.14.7. 5.11.17.  Return  to  Duty  Program  (RTDP).    Airmen  eligible  are:  1)  an  enlisted  Airman sentenced by court-martial to a dishonorable or bad conduct punitive discharge, with or without adjudged  confinement,  whose  discharge  has  not  been  executed,  or  2)  an  enlisted  Airman sentenced by court-martial to a period of confinement, with or without adjudged dishonorable or bad conduct punitive discharge.  Airmen in either of these examples who have otherwise met the requirements in AFI 31-105, AF Corrections System, may present a request to return to  active  status  as  specified  in  AFI  31-105.      The  Air  Force  Clemency  and  Parole  Board (AFC&PB), using the criteria outlined in AFI 31-105, will decide if post trial enlisted Airmen have been rehabilitated.  In every case, the needs of the service will govern the return-to-duty of these Airmen. 5.11.17.1.  Airmen sentenced to a punitive discharge (with or without) confinement which was  upgraded  by  the  AFC&PB  to  an  honorable  discharge  are  separated  with  the  new discharge characterization and eligible to reenlist under RE code “1S”.  Airmen become eligible for reentry to service as determined by AFI 36-2101. 5.11.17.2.  Airmen  sentenced  to  confinement  without  a  punitive  discharge  may  be returned-to-duty by the AFC&PB with an RE code “2D” which prevents reenlistment until Airman have served at least 6 months after release from confinement and, are otherwise eligible, and their unit commander/civilian directors select them for reenlistment under the SRP or approve reenlistment waivers. 5.12.  RE Codes.  Accurate RE codes are vital to ensure the Air Force retains and reenlists only those  Airmen  selected  for  continued  service  and  prevents  ineligible  Airmen  from  continued service.  The MPS will update, monitor, and maintain accurate RE codes in MilPDS.  Incorrect codes  can  prevent  or  allow  the  selection  of  Airmen  for  reenlistment,  promotion,  separation, retirement and reassignment. (T-1). The MPS will: 5.12.1.  Update  RE  codes  in  MilPDS  using  the  following  hierarchy:    2“letter”,  4“letter”, 3“letter”, and 1“letter”. (T-1). (Note: No RE code takes precedence over RE codes in 2“letter”, to include pending MEB/PEB.  MPS will re-update RE code to 2“letter” in such cases. [T-1].) 5.12.2.  Update  the  appropriate  RE  code  according  to  the  hierarchy  in  paragraph  5.12.1  in MilPDS when two or more RE codes apply. (T-1). 5.12.3.  Update the appropriate RE code with the longest duration in MilPDS when two or more RE codes in the same series apply. (T-1). 5.12.4.  Leave RE code 2X in MilPDS unless SRP selection occurs or RE code 2X is being replaced by a higher priority code. (T-1). 5.12.5.  Verify  RE  codes  in  MilPDS  NLT  60  days  for  all  Airmen  separating.  Incorrect  or inappropriate  RE  codes  are  corrected  as  needed.    Refer  requests  for  corrections  to  AFPC Reenlistments via current processing procedures.  (Note:  See Tables 5.3 - 5.6). AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 65 Table 5.3.

RE code 1A is only applicable to FTA who previously had an approved CJR and the CJR was later suspended.  FTA who did not receive an approved CJR during their CJR window are ineligible to request a CJR while holding RE code 1A and, therefore, cannot reenlist. Remove RE code 1A from MilPDS  immediately  following  update  of  the  extension  or  immediately  following  the Airman’s reenlistment (refer to paragraph 4.16.) and update to a more applicable RE code.  2. Airman must meet all other eligibility requirements for reenlistment or an extension of enlistment. (T-1). 3. All reenlistment ineligibility conditions must be waived by the commander/civilian director in order to allow an Airman to reenlist.  The commander/civilian director may waive two or more ineligibility conditions concurrently on the same form. (T-1). However, if there is an ineligibility condition for which there is no waiver provision, the commander/civilian director cannot grant a waiver. 4. An Airman who has lost time or has been in confinement is not eligible to extend until their lost time has been computed and corrected.  5. To qualify, the Airman must be currently performing in the SRB skills (C/DAFSC), not be assigned in a patient status (9P000), medical condition is stable as determined by medical authorities and otherwise be eligible to reenlist.  The Airman/commander/civilian director will submit the following documents to the MPS: (T-1). a. Commander/civilian director recommendation:  Certifying the Airman is performing duties within the AFSC and specify any duties the Airman is unable to perform (if applicable).  b. Primary Care Manager (PCM):  PCMs assess the Airman’s capabilities and limitations with respect to performing core task within his/her AFSC, state whether the Airman’s condition is stable and prognosis for continued improvement.  c. Provide Business Case Analysis:  Describe how the Airman’s utilization within the AFSC fills valid Unit Manning Document (UMD) requirement and benefits the overall community.  d. Waiver processing procedures:  The MPS will review the case file for completeness and return all incomplete requests to the unit. (T-1). . Complete case files will be forwarded to AFPC Reenlistments via current processing procedures. AFPC will review for completeness and forwards to AF/A1. (T-1).  AF/A1 will obtain Functional Manager (FM) and Career Field Manager (CFM) recommendation and obtain AF/A1 review and final determination. AF/A1 notifies  appropriate  parties  of  the  final  decision.  The  MPS  will  advise  the  unit commander/civilian director on the final decision. (T-3).  If approved to reenlist through the waiver  process,  the  RE  code  4K  will  be  temporarily  removed  to  allow  update  of  the reenlistment,  but  the  MPS  will  re-update  the  RE  code  to  4K  once  the  reenlistment consummates. (T-1).  (Note:  In all cases, Airmen will retain the RE code 4K until medically cleared for duty.)  Table 5.8.  Terms of Reenlistment.

General Information.  Under certain circumstances, an Airman’s current enlistment period may be extended. Extension of enlistment may be voluntarily requested by Airmen.  This chapter outlines  the  policies  and  procedures  that  affect  extension  of  enlistment  for  Airmen  in  all components of the Air Force.  Unique component extension of enlistment requirements are divided into three Sections as follows: 6.1.1.  Paragraph 6.6: Airmen assigned to the RegAF. 6.1.2.  Paragraph 6.7: Airmen assigned to the AFR. 6.1.3.  Paragraph 6.8: Airmen assigned to the ANG. 6.2.  Extension Limitations  . 6.2.1.  The MPS will limit extensions to the minimum number of months needed to achieve the intended purpose.  Airmen extend in whole month periods only.  Only Airmen in SRB AFSCs may extend for 36 or up to 48 months in one increment to qualify for an authorized SRB even though less retainability is required.  When enlistments or reenlistments begin on the first day of a month, the extended DOS is always the last day of the month.  (Example: If Airman’s date of enlistment is 1 May, and the DOS is 30 April, then a 1-month extension would result in a 31 May DOS.) 6.2.2.  Voluntary  extensions  for  all  Airmen  are  limited  to  a  maximum  of  48  months  per enlistment (10 USC § 509). This cannot be waived. (T-0). 6.3.  Leave Settlement  . Airmen may sell leave only upon entry into the first voluntary extension of their current enlistment. 6.3.1.  Leave is sold once Airman enters the extension.  If the Airman enters the extension in a different Fiscal Year (FY) from when they signed the form, ensure the Airman understands leave may be lost.  Airmen cannot sell leave if they have already sold 60 days in their career or are entering a second or subsequent extension of enlistment.  The Airman’s base pay on ETS determines the payment.  Airmen document their election on the AF Form 1411.  Airmen may change their leave settlement elections at any time prior to the 10 day calendar period of the effective date of entry into the extension of enlistment on an AF Form 1089.  (RegAF MPS refers to the PSDG for DJMS-AC update instructions.) 6.3.2.  The MPS must verify the Airman’s leave election as documented on the AF Form 1411 or AF Form 1089, if applicable before processing the E6 transaction to DFAS-IN. 6.4.  Erroneous Extension Documents  .  Also refer to paragraph 5.9 as this applies to this section as  well.  This  paragraph  applies  to  the  AF  Form  1411  and  AF  Form  1411-1.  Only  AFPC Reenlistments  (AFRC/A1K  for  AFR)  (NGB/A1PP  for  ANG)  can  authorize  correction  of contractual errors. 6.4.1.  Contractual Errors.  Airmen not authorized to extend or in violation of this AFI (no CJR [when in constrained skills], ineligible RE code, etc.) will have their contract voided. 92 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 6.4.2.  Administrative Errors.  MPS may correct administrative errors discovered on the AF Form 1411 or AF Form 1411-1, if the Airman and Air Force agree.  However, any documents submitted  with  an  unauthorized/erroneous  SRB  will  require  the  document(s)  to  be  re-accomplished.  (Note: When an Airman refuses to initial/sign the corrected AF Form 901, removing the SRB in the event it is deleted from the list, the MPS will document the AF Form 901 by entering the following statement on the reverse: “(Grade, name, SSN of Airman) has refused to sign this document acknowledging and confirming his or her ineligibility for the bonus.”) Any erroneously awarded bonus will be terminated and recouped. If corrections were made on the forms, stamp ”CORRECTED COPY” in the upper margin of the corrected pages and make a photocopy of the corrected forms for the Airman.  The MPS corrects MilPDS and DJMS-AC, as appropriate and distributes the documents IAW Table 5.10. 6.4.2.1.  AFPC Reenlistments (AFRC/A1K for AFR) (NGB/A1PP for ANG) will direct the AF Form 1411 be corrected to reflect the authorized SRB in cases where an SRB was not properly documented on the contract and the Airman executed a qualifying extension or  direct  an  unauthorized  SRB  entitlement  be  removed  from  the  AF  Form  1411.    The Airman and MPS representatives initial each correction. When correcting the ARMS copy of the AF Form 1411/1411-1, type “Corrected Copy” in the upper margin of the AF Form 1411/1411-1, make a photo copy of the corrected AF Form 1411/1411-1 and comply with the disposition instructions in Table 5.10 and the RDS located in the AFRIMS. 6.4.3.  Correcting  administrative  errors  on  contracts  returned  for  correction:    The  MPS retrieves the ARMS copy and makes appropriate corrections to the form. 6.4.4.  The  Airman  and  MPS  representative  initial  each  correction.  Type  “CORRECTED COPY” in the upper margin of the corrected pages; make a photocopy of the corrected forms and comply with the disposition instructions in Table 5.10. 6.4.5.  Do not make corrections to the form stamped “DO NOT CORRECT THIS COPY” unless there is no ARMS copy and the Airman does not have a copy. 6.4.6.  In those situations, correct the copy stamped “DO NOT CORRECT THIS COPY” and type “Only Available Copy” in the upper margin of the corrected pages; make a photo copy of the corrected forms and comply with the disposition instructions in Table 5.10. 6.4.7.  Do not reaccomplish the AF Form 1411/1411-1 unless there is no ARMS copy and the Airman does not have a copy. 6.4.8.  If contract must be reaccomplished, type “Reconstructed Copy” in the upper margin of the new contract. (T-1).  All dates for signatures must be actual date signed. (T-1).  Make a photo copy of the corrected forms and comply with the disposition instructions in Table 5.10.  (Note:  Commanders may not refuse to re-accomplish these documents). 6.4.9.  The MPS sends the corrected/reconstructed copy IAW Table 5.10., corrects MilPDS, verifies DFAS files and takes appropriate action if needed, and DJMS-AC as appropriate. 6.5.  Extension Cancellation  . 6.5.1.  The AF Form 1411-1 will be used to document all cancellations of extensions.  Other reasons may preclude cancellation of an extension and are processed according to paragraph 6.5.1.  (Note:    RE  code  4K  Airmen  later  cleared  may  cancel  if  not  entered  or  reenlist AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 93 immediately with obligated service waived, if entered.) Extensions may not be cancelled if, at a minimum, any of the following apply: 6.5.1.1.  The Airman has entered the extension. 6.5.1.2.  The  Airman  extended  under  Table  6.2,  Rule  23,  25,  28b,  28c,  28d  or  29 (Exception: If Airman extended as a nominee for the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year and not selected [Rule 28b]). 6.5.1.3.  The Airman extended for elective surgery. 6.5.1.4.  The duration of the obligation is changed by the Air Force.  (Example: Airman extended for a four-year controlled tour and after arrival, the controlled tour is changed to a three-year tour.) 6.5.1.5.  The  Airman  extended  for  an  assignment,  or  the  Airman  extended  for  an assignment and departed for that (or any other) location (to include to accept retraining or a special duty). 6.5.1.6.  This does not preclude early separation if Airman applies for voluntary separation or is involuntarily discharged. 6.5.2.  The commander/civilian director may request extension cancellation if a reenlistment ineligibility  condition  in  Table  5.4  and/or  Table  5.6  causes  cancellation  of  the  reasons  for which an Airman extended.  (Note: Commanders/civilian directors cannot request extension cancellation if the affected Airman is a lengthy-service Airman [refer to paragraph 6.6.3], the extension reasons were fulfilled or still exist, or the Airman extended according to Table 6.2, Rules 17 through 24.) 6.5.2.1.  The commander/civilian director notifies the Airman, in writing, of their intent to request extension cancellation, and advises the Airman they may submit a statement on their own behalf within 5 workdays of acknowledgment.  The commander completes AF Form  1411-1,  attaches  their  intent  letter  and  the  Airman’s  statement,  and  sends  the documents to the Chief, MPS for approval or disapproval. 6.5.2.2.  If the Chief, MPS approves the extension cancellation, complete AF Form 1411-1: 6.5.2.2.1.  The MPS attaches any supporting documentation to the ARMS copy of AF Form 1411-1, deletes the extensions from MilPDS once finalized, and verifies DFAS files (take appropriate action if needed). The MPS then sends the Airman copies of the AF Form 1411-1 and the initial notification letter to the commander. 6.5.2.2.2.  The  commander/civilian  director  ensures  Airman  indorses  the  initial notification letter, acknowledging receipt of the decision and that an appeal may be submitted in accordance with paragraph 6.6.11 and disposes of the forms according to Table 5.10.  The commander/civilian director ensures the Airman documents appeal intent before  returning the letter to the MPS for processing according to paragraph 6.6.11. 6.5.2.3.  The Chief, MPS disapproves extension cancellation request by  completing AF Form 1411-1 and enters their rationale in the remarks section: 94 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 6.5.2.3.1.  The MPS sends the Airman’s copy of the AF Form 1411-1 and the initial notification  letter  to  the  commander/civilian  director  and  suspenses  the  remaining copies of the forms pending receipt of the Airman’s acknowledgment. 6.5.2.3.2.  The  commander/civilian  director  ensures  the  Airman  indorses  the  initial notification letter, acknowledging receipt of the decision, and returns the letter to the MPS. 6.5.2.3.3.  The MPS attaches the letter to the ARMS copy of AF Form 1411-1 and disposes of the forms according to Table 5.10. 6.5.3.  Airmen may request extension cancellation to immediately reenlist due to unique and unusual  circumstances  or  when  other  reasons  for  cancellation  were  not  used  or  are inappropriate and when fulfilling the extension would result in an injustice.  The Airman may request  extension  cancellation  under  this  provision  only  when  the  extension  has  not  been executed.    The  MPS  and  member’s  commander/civilian  director  ensures  the  extension cancellation and reenlistment occur on the same day.  (Note: Non-receipt of a Retention Bonus [RB] is not an injustice.) 6.5.3.1.  The  MPS  assists  the  Airman  in  completing  AF  Form  1411-1,  Section  II  and suspenses the form pending final action.  Refer to paragraph 6.6.8 for general processing instructions.  Chief, MPS may disapprove the request, but AFPC Reenlistments (for RegAF Airmen) is the approval authority. 6.5.3.2.  The  MPS  completes  AF  Form  1411-1  to  document  approval  or  disapproval, attaches copies of the correspondence to each copy of the AF Form 1411-1, and disposes of the form according to Table 5.10.  MPS deletes extension from MilPDS as appropriate. 6.5.4.  The Airman may request cancellation of extensions initiated according to Table 6.2, Rules 12 through 16, if the reason for the extension was cancelled, or no longer exist. Airmen must request cancellation no later than 30 calendar days following notification that the original reason  for  the  extension  was  cancelled  or  no  longer  exists.    Commander/civilian  director coordination is not required.  The Air Force considers failure to cancel the extensions within this time period as willingness on the part of the Airman to serve out the extension. (Example: An Airman extended to qualify for a CONUS PCS assignment, but was notified of assignment cancellation before entry into the extension.  The Airman must submit the cancellation request within 30 calendar days of assignment cancellation notification.) (T-1).  (Note:  Requests for extension cancellation after the 30 calendar day period are denied by the MPS and are not to be forwarded to AFPC Reenlistments for consideration; however, the Airman may petition the AFBCMR for relief.) 6.5.4.1.  The  MPS  enters  the  authority  for  cancellation  and  a  brief  explanation  in  the remarks  section  of  the  AF  Form  1411-1  as  follows:  "Assignment  cancelled  per  AFPC Reenlistments email, dated 15 Jun 2015." 6.5.4.2.  When Airmen request extension cancellation IAW paragraph 6.6.5.4, the MPS will complete the AF Form 1411-1 without referral to the commander. 6.5.5.  When an existing extension (not yet entered) is subject to cancellation according to paragraphs 6.6.5.2 or 6.6.5.3 and is to be replaced by an extension of a shorter duration, MPS administratively corrects the contract. AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 95 6.5.6.  FTA/NCORP retrainees may request cancellation IAW paragraph 5.11.5 of this AFI. 6.6.  Extension  of  Enlistment  in  the  Regular  Air  Force  (RegAF).  Extension  Approval Authority.    AFPC  Reenlistments  reserves  authority  to  approve  extensions  of  enlistment  under certain conditions specified in Table 6.2.  Airmen must be eligible to extend and have a service-directed reason as documented in Table 6.2 to extend. (T-0).  Airmen requesting to extend for any reason(s) when no other rule in Table 6.2 applies may request an extension under Table 6.2, Rule 28d.  See paragraph 6.6.8.  Otherwise, base-level officials resolve all requests for extensions and extension cancellation.  An extension is considered executed once the Airman has been approved to extend (AF Form 1411), and both the Airman and commander/civilian director have signed the AF Form 1411. 6.6.1.  The Chief, MPS or their designated representatives approve or disapprove extension or extension cancellation requests (AF Form 1411/1411-1).  Designated representatives must be assigned to the MPS or GSU personnel functions, and possess the grade of TSgt, GS-6, or higher.  (T-2).    The  MPS  ensures  the  commander  on  G-series  orders  or  civilian  director documents their recommendation on the AF Form 1411. 6.6.1.1.  Personnel specified in paragraph 6.6.1 will review extensions executed and act as the  service  representative  for  the  extension  of  enlistment  and  validate/confirm eligibility/entitlements. (T-1). 6.6.1.2.  If deployment occurs, MPS updates these extensions in MilPDS and distributes the forms according to Table 5.10.  If deployment does not occur, MPS destroys the AF Form 1411 at the end of the exercise (as directed in the RDS).  (Note:  Do not update extensions in MilPDS produced for the sole purpose of an exercise.) 6.6.2.  Extension Limitations. 6.6.2.1.  In  the  event  AFSCs  are  constrained,  AF/A1  may  limit  FTA  extensions  to  a specified period (10 USC § 509).  (Note: Otherwise, there is no limit to the number of valid extensions.    Involuntary  extensions  [for  example,  extensions  for  STOP  LOSS  and administrative/disciplinary hold] do not count towards the maximum number of months an Airman can extend.)  See paragraph 6.6.2. 6.6.2.2.  Refer  to  paragraph  6.6.9  for  information  on  HYT  and  age  60  extension restrictions. 6.6.2.3.  The MPS will not authorize Airmen to cancel a previously approved extension for the purpose of combining it with additional extensions, to reenlist rather than extend, or to enhance SRB entitlements.  Likewise, the MPS will not combine extensions to qualify Airmen for an SRB. (T-1). 6.6.3.  Extensions  for  Lengthy-Service  Airmen.  Attachment  1  contains  the  definition  of lengthy-service Airmen. Refer to 10 USC § 1176(a) for background information. 6.6.3.1.  The  extension  approval  authorities  specified  in  paragraph  6.6.1  will  not  deny extensions requested by lengthy-service Airmen if the extension period does not exceed 20 years, 1 month of TAFMS, and the Airman is otherwise eligible for the extension.  This restriction applies even if the requested DOS does not permit the Airman to complete 20 years TAFMS.  (Example: If a lengthy-service Airman will complete 18 years, 6 months 96 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 on  DOS,  and  requests  a  4-month  extension  to  obtain  a  passing  fitness  score,  approval authorities cannot deny the extension request.) 6.6.3.2.  Commanders may not request extension cancellation if the affected Airman is a lengthy-service  Airman  (refer  to  paragraph  6.5.1.).    The  MPS  returns  request  to commander without taking further action. 6.6.4.  Extensions  for  Service-Directed  Requirements.  Airmen  may,  if  otherwise  eligible, reenlist according to Table 5.3, 5.8 and 5.9 or extend their enlistments according to Table 6.2 for the minimum number of months required. 6.6.4.1.  Eligible Airmen serving in SRB skills, who hold a 3-skill level or higher in the SRB skill, may  extend their enlistments in one increment for a minimum period of 36 months  up  to,  and  including,  a  maximum  period  of  48  months.    Airmen  may  use  this provision only if they are extending according to Table 6.2, Rules 12, 13, 14 and 29 and have not already extended for a total period of 12 or more months. Airmen may use this extension option even if they require less retainability. 6.6.4.1.1.  Airmen qualify for an SRB entitlement on the day they sign the extension but do not receive the SRB payment until the day they enter the extension provided they remain qualified. 6.6.4.1.2.  The MPS will review the current SRB skills list to ensure Airmen are serving in SRB skills (CAFSC and DAFSC) or when requesting extensions. (T-3).  The day the Airman enters an extension determines the SRB Zone.  (Example:  If an Airman extends while serving in the Zone A window, but will be in the Zone B window on the day the extension is entered, the Airman receives a Zone B bonus if eligible according to Table 4.1, item 2.  The day the Airman signs the extension determines the SRB multiple level.  Future changes to the SRB skills list do not affect SRB entitlements.)  (Note:  The MPS must accurately review the current SRB authorization listing and accurately calculate the Airman’s TAFMS to determine the SRB zone the Airman will be in upon entering the zone.) (T-1). 6.6.4.1.3.  Eligible for SRB and Electing not to Accept an SRB.  Airmen eligible for an SRB on their current enlistment or eligible extension may elect not to accept the SRB designated for that reenlistment/extension.  Airmen who elect not to accept the SRB must complete the applicable Section of the AF Form 901 or AF Form 1411.  The decision not to accept the SRB is irrevocable once the AF Form 901 has been approved by  the  commander/civilian  leader  and  accepted  for  reenlistment/extension  of enlistment by the MPS representative.  No exceptions will be considered. 6.6.5.  Extensions for Reenlistment-Ineligible Airmen.  The MPS may approve extensions for reenlistment-ineligible Airmen as indicated below.  (Note:  MPS will not permit Airmen to extend  while  SRP  reconsideration  [RE  code  3B]  is  pending.)  (T-1).    Commanders  must conduct SRP consideration within 30 days when the ineligibility condition no longer exists. (T-1).  See Chapter 2 and 2.6.  6.6.5.1.  Career  Airmen  ineligible  to  reenlist  who  hold  RE  codes  2R  through  2U  may request extensions provided they have not refused to obtain service-directed retainability or cancelled an extension for the purpose of separation. AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 97 6.6.5.2.  FTA who have the RE code 3C who require additional retainability may request extensions if otherwise qualified.  FTA do not need approved CJRs in order to extend, unless the AFSC is constrained and prohibited from extending or if the Air Force denied the Airman a CJR IAW para 3.6.2. 6.6.5.3.  Reenlistment  ineligible  Airmen  may  only  request  extensions  if  ineligibility conditions allow for an extension in Table 6.2.  For example, Airmen may not extend to obtain retainability for promotion under Table 6.2, rule 1, if RE code is 4J. 6.6.5.4.  First  term  non-US  citizens  (RE  code  2I)  may  request  extensions  to  attain citizenship, provided they have already applied for citizenship and are within 120 days of their DOS.  The requested extension period may not exceed their projected swear-in date plus 30 days, or 6 months, whichever is sooner.  The MPS may authorize additional 6-month extensions as needed (not to exceed 48 months total).  If citizenship is not granted prior to the end of Airman’s 48 cumulative extension months, waivers are not to be granted and the Airman separates on their DOS. 6.6.5.5.  Airmen who appeal SRP non-selection (RE code 2X) may request extensions of enlistment to await the outcome.  When the appeal authority is at the Wing or below, the MPS approves extensions in one-month increments until the Airman’s appeal is finalized. When the appeal authority is the SecAF, the MPS approves  extensions in three-month increments  until  the  Airman’s  appeal  is  finalized.    (Note:  MPS  must  contact  AFPC Reenlistments three months prior to ETS, if appeal is still being processed and member has already extended 45 months on current enlistment.) (T-1). 6.6.5.6.  Lengthy-service  Airmen  who  are  non-selected  under  the  SRP  may  request extension of enlistment in order to obtain minimum retirement eligibility. 6.6.5.7.  Constructive Reenlistments.  See paragraph 5.11.4.4. 6.6.6.  Extensions  for  Airman  Medically  Disqualified  (Medical  Hold).    AFPC  Medical Standards is the sole approval authority for ALC-C, Medical Hold and non-emergent elective surgery during a RegAF service member’s final six months of service.  Medical Hold is a method of retaining a service member beyond an established retirement or separation date for reason of disability processing, for conditions when presumption of fitness does not apply.  It is not used for the purpose of evaluating or treating chronic conditions, performing diagnostic studies, elective treatment of medical defects, non-emergent elective surgery or its subsequent convalescence. Extensions approved under this paragraph are subject to age, HYT and the maximum length limitations/restrictions. (Note:  Commanders may not disapprove.) 6.6.6.1.  The MPS will: 6.6.6.1.1.  Receive verification from AFPC Medical Standards outlining the number of months of the approved medical hold extension. (T-1). 6.6.6.1.1.1.  Process the extension IAW current Air Force procedures. 6.6.6.1.1.2.  Airmen cannot be forced to remain in service beyond their ETS. They must agree in writing to a medical hold and execute the AF Form 1411. (T-1). 6.6.6.1.1.3.  Airmen  extending  under  this  rule  may  immediately  reenlist  once medically cleared and obligated service (Medical Hold portion) is waived. 98 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 6.6.6.1.1.4.  Airmen who have not entered the extension may request cancellation.  The Airmen must submit the cancellation request within 30 days of the MEB/PEB return to duty adjudication. (T-1). 6.6.6.1.1.5.  Airmen extending under this rule and later removed from medical hold or who declines continued medical hold or MEB/PEB in writing have their DOS established by AFPC Reenlistments. 6.6.6.2.  Airmen in RE code 4K may voluntarily extend their enlistment under this AFI when additional retainability is needed for promotion.  (Note:  In all cases, Airmen will retain the RE code 4K until medically cleared for duty.) (T-1). Limit extension period to a maximum of 24 months. 6.6.6.3.  Limit  pregnancy  extensions  (Airman  or  spouse)  to  the  minimum  number  of months required to establish a DOS of delivery date plus one month. 6.6.7.  Extension Reasons.  Table 6.2 lists the approval conditions for voluntary extensions of enlistment.  MPS will not approve extensions requested for the purpose of: (T-1). 6.6.7.1.  Personal convenience or monetary advantage, except as specified under Table 6.2, Rule 28b-d. 6.6.7.2.  Increasing bonus entitlement (not applicable to paragraph 6.6.4.1). 6.6.7.3.  Providing additional time to make  a career decision or deferring separation to coincide with civilian plans. 6.6.7.4.  Applying for a CJR or requesting retraining consideration. 6.6.8.  How to Complete and Process Extension of Enlistment or Cancellation(s) of Extension of Enlistment Requests: The MPS uses AF Form 1411 to document all extension and AF Form 1411-1 to document extension cancellation requests. 6.6.8.1.  The MPS verifies RE codes by MilPDS inquiry before initiating AF Form 1411 and enters all appropriate data elements.  The MPS ensures the requests comply with all general limitations and requirements. 6.6.8.2.  The commander makes recommendations by entering disapproval rationale in the appropriate section of the AF Form 1411 or on a separate sheet and sends the form and any attachments to the MPS. 6.6.8.3.  The MPS personnel identified in paragraph 6.6.1 will take the following actions: (T-1). 6.6.8.3.1.  The commander recommends approval of the extension by completing the AF Form 1411.  Refer to paragraph 6.6.3 for restrictions concerning lengthy-service Airmen.  The extension is approved/disapproved once the extension action has been updated in MilPDS. 6.6.8.3.1.1.  Update approved extensions in MilPDS (refer to the PSDG), verify DFAS  file  (take  appropriate  action  if  needed),  and  comply  with  the  disposition instructions in Table 5.10 and refer to AFRIMS RDS Table 36-13 and 36-14 for disposition instructions. AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 99 6.6.8.3.2.  When the commander recommends disapproval, send request to the Chief, MPS for decision.  Chief, MPS may disapprove the request, or recommend approval and send the request to the FSS/CC for resolution.  (Note: Chief, MPS will approve request for lengthy service Airmen as outlined by paragraph 6.6.3.) (T-1). 6.6.8.3.3.  Refer to paragraph 6.6.11 for disapproved extension requests and comply with the disposition instructions in Table 5.10. Refer to AFRIMS RDS Table 36-13 and 36-14 for additional disposition guidance. 6.6.8.4.  When extension requests require AFPC Reenlistments consideration (Table 6.2, Rule 28d): 6.6.8.4.1.  The Airman will: 6.6.8.4.1.1.  Prepare memorandum requesting extension. (T-1). 6.6.8.4.1.2.  Forward request to their commander who considers the request and recommends  approval  or  disapproval.  (T-1).    If  the  commander  disapproves request, the commander will notify Airman of decision not to support the extension. (T-1).  If the commander recommends approval, the Airman will forward request to MPS. (T-1). 6.6.8.4.2.  The MPS will: 6.6.8.4.2.1.  The MPS will create case files consisting of the memorandum, and any additional supporting documentation.  (Note:  Do not initiate/complete an AF Form 1411.) (T-1). 6.6.8.4.2.2.  Forward  requests  to  AFPC  Reenlistments  according  to  current guidance for review and final approval/disapproval. 6.6.8.4.2.2.1.  Upon receipt of AFPC Reenlistments approval, initiate/complete AF Form 1411 and reference AFPC Reenlistments approval in the remarks on the AF Form 1411, update approved extensions in MilPDS (refer to the PSDG), verify  DFAS  files  (take  appropriate  action  if  needed)  and  comply  with  the disposition instructions in Table 5.10. Refer to AFRIMS RDS Table 36-13 and 36-14 for additional disposition guidance. 6.6.8.4.2.3.  Upon receipt of AFPC Reenlistments disapproval, the MPS advises the Airman of disapproval and closes the case. 6.6.8.4.3.  AFPC Reenlistments will: 6.6.8.4.3.1.  Ensure package is complete and return incomplete packages. (T-1). 6.6.8.4.3.2.  Provide the MPS approval/disapproval notification. (T-1). 6.6.9.  HYT  and  Age  60  Restrictions.    The  restrictions  outlined  in  paragraph  5.11.12  and 5.11.12.1 also apply to extensions.  Request for HYT adjustments, corrections, and/or waivers are  sent  to  AFPC  Retirements  via  current  processing  procedures.  (Note:  Under  no circumstances  can  any  reenlistment  or  extension  exceed  the  Airman's  HYT  plus  1  month, unless otherwise provided.) 100 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 6.6.9.1.  Airmen may extend to establish a DOS at their HYT plus 1 month or age 60, provided they are otherwise eligible and are within 2 years of their HYT plus 1 month or age 60 (Table 6.2, rules 3 and 27). 6.6.9.2.  TSgts  who  wish  to  serve  6  months  time-in-grade  before  HYT  retirement  may qualify for extensions according to Table 6.2, rule 1. 6.6.9.3.  First Term Airmen extending under paragraph 6.6.4 may extend their enlistments beyond their HYT plus 1 month if authorized to receive a Zone A SRB and their new DOS won’t exceed the last day of the month during which they complete 10 years TAFMS. See paragraph 4.5 for additional eligibility criteria. 6.6.9.4.  Airmen in the grade of TSgt extending under paragraph 6.6.4 may extend their enlistments beyond their HYT plus 1 month if authorized to receive a Zone E SRB and their new DOS won’t exceed the last day of the month during which they complete 22 years TAFMS. See table 4.1, item 4 for additional eligibility criteria. 6.6.9.5.  CSRB - For Airmen authorized a CSRB, the HYT may be waived at the discretion of the SecAF or designated representative.  AFPC will adjust after the CSRB contract is processed. 6.6.9.6.  Airmen with DOS that exceeds HYT due to demotion, etc. will have their DOS adjusted to match their new HYT date. Before beginning any separation package, consult AFI 36-3208.  The separation authority may withhold execution of a separation for any reason in the best interest of the Air Force. (T-1). 6.6.10.  Extension Counseling Requirements. Airmen must initial or MPS mark the applicable statements on the AF Form 1411. (T-1).  Counselors must be assigned to the MPS or GSU personnel function and possess the grade of A1C, GS-4, or higher. (T-2).  Counselors explain each applicable item to the Airman and complete the appropriate section of the AF Form 1411. 6.6.11.  Extension Appeal Processing. This paragraph applies to extensions and cancellation of extensions of enlistment (except extensions approved/disapproved by AFPC Reenlistments [Table 6.2, rule 28d]) which are disapproved or cancelled according to paragraph 6.5. 6.6.11.1.  The  Airman  will  acknowledge  receipt  of  the  disapproval  of  cancellation recommendation  within  1  workday  following  receipt  of  the  AF  Form  1411-1.  (T-1).  Airmen also acknowledge that a written appeal may be submitted to the MPS within 5 workdays of the acknowledgment date. 6.6.11.2.  When an Airman does not elect to appeal, the MPS forwards the AF Form 1411-1 to ARMS for filing.  When the Airman elects to appeal, the MPS places the AF Form 1411/1411-1 (as appropriate) into suspense, pending receipt of the appeal.  If the Airman does not submit an appeal within the proper time frame, the MPS annotates the 1411-1 or AF Form 1411 as appropriate and disposes of the case according to Table 5.10. 6.6.11.3.  When Airmen submit a written appeal: 6.6.11.3.1.  The MPS sends the appeal and a photocopy of all pertinent documentation (AF Form 1411/1411-1, attachments, etc.) to the servicing legal office for review.  MPS includes  the  legal  advisory  in  the  case  file  then  sends  the  case  file  to  the  group commander within 5 workdays.  Legal advisories are not considered new information; and  commander  recommendations  are  not  considered  new  information,  unless  the AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 101 commander adds new documentation/information.  (Note: Give Airmen 3 workdays to rebut any new information added to the case file after the appeal is submitted.) 6.6.11.3.1.1.  When  the  group  commander  is  the  appeal  authority,  he/she  will approve or disapprove the appeal and return it to the MPS. (T-1).  If approved, reference paragraph 6.6.11.4.  If disapproved, reference paragraph 6.6.11.5. 6.6.11.3.1.2.  When  the  SecAF  is  the  appeal  authority,  the  case  must  process through both the group and wing commander. (T-1).  The group commander may approve the appeal or recommend disapproval and return it to the MPS.  If the group commander approves, see paragraph 6.6.11.4.  If the group commander disapproves the appeal, package is sent to the wing commander. 6.6.11.3.1.3.  If the wing commander approves appeal, see paragraph 6.6.11.4.  If the wing commander disapproves the appeal, the wing commander returns package to the MPS.  The MPS makes a copy for their records and forwards the original package to AFPC Reenlistments for processing to the SecAF. 6.6.11.3.1.4.  If  the  wing  commander  denied  the  extension  request,  the  appeal authority is their parent MAJCOM, DRU or FOA Director of Personnel (A1). 6.6.11.4.  When the appeal is approved, the appeal authority completes the AF Form 1411 or AF Form 1411-1.  The MPS officials will notify the Airman/commander and make the appropriate updates in MilPDS using normal processing procedures and forward the case file to ARMS for filing. (T-1). 6.6.11.5.  When the appeal is disapproved, MPS ensures the Airman acknowledges receipt of the disapproval.  The MPS attaches the statement and disapproval correspondence to the AF Form 1411/1411-1. (Note: MPS gives the Airman a copy of the documentation upon request.)    Ensure  a  copy  of  the  case  file  is  sent  to  ARMS  for  filing  in  the  Airman’s electronic records. Table 6.1.  Extension Appeal Authority. If the Airman is a: Appeal Authority Respective Wing Commander 1, 3 Respective Group Commander Respective Group Commander First Term Airmen Career Airmen who complete 20 or more years total service on current ETS Second Term and Career Airmen who complete fewer than 16 years total service on current ETS Career Airmen who complete at least 16 years, but fewer than 20 years total service on current ETS Any Airman assigned in a joint base construct, the wing commander level for appeal purposes Notes: 1. Once the case file has been considered by the approval authority, the decision is final and the case cannot be sent to a level above that authority to have the decision overturned. Air Force commander above the group level SecAF See Note: 1, 2 1, 2 1 1 102 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 2. These Airmen appeal to their wing commander, if the group commander made the SRP non-selection decision 3. These Airmen appeal to their MAJCOM/DRU/FOA A1, if the wing commander made the SRP nonselection decision. 6.6.12.  Involuntary  Extensions.    These  include  Air  Force  initiated  extensions  that  do  not consider  the  member’s  desire  and  may  be  executed  due  to  STOP  LOSS  and/or administrative/legal  holds  for  investigation  and  disciplinary  reasons  (this  does  not  include Medical Hold extensions unless the member is incapacitated and unable to submit a voluntary statement).  Involuntary extensions do not count as obligated service on the next reenlistment and do not count towards the maximum number of months authorized as outlined in paragraph 6.2.2. 6.6.12.1.

Background  : The Enlisted CSRB is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)-driven requirement and is  applicable to Airmen  assigned in the RegAF.  It does not apply to  Airmen assigned to the Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard. 7.2.  Program Overview  :  This is a financial incentive paid to Airmen who reenlist or agree to continue serving on active duty for at least one additional year in a military skill designated as critical  by  the  PDUSD  (P&R).    The  intent  of  the  bonus  is  to  provide  a  financial  incentive  to influence  retention  decisions  of  Service  Airmen  in  designated  CSRB-AFSCs  taking  into consideration current or projected manning shortages, skill imbalances, and high training costs or high replacement costs, in cases where less costly methods are inadequate or impractical.  The CSRB program set forth in this Chapter is subject to authorization under 37 USC § 355, DoDD 1304.21, Policy on Enlistment Bonuses, Accession Bonuses for New Officers in Critical Skills, Selective Reenlistment Bonuses and Critical Skills Retention Bonuses for Active Members and DoDI  1304.29  Administration  of  Enlistment  Bonuses,  Accession  Bonuses  for  New  Officers  in Critical Skills, Selective Reenlistment Bonuses, and Critical Skills Retention Bonuses for Active Members, for such bonuses.  The combined CSRB and SRB received during a career cannot exceed $200,000 unless specifically authorized as an exception by the PDUSD (P&R). 7.3.  Eligibility Criteria/Qualifications  :  7.3.1.  At  a  minimum,  Airmen  must  be  in  the  designated  AFSC  and  enlisted  grade  as designated    by  PDUSD  (P&R)  and  published  in  the  Implementation  Guidance,  must  have completed at least 19 years of service and be otherwise eligible to reenlist. (T-1). 7.3.2.  Eligible Airmen are authorized to reenlist at any time during their current enlistment and the remaining obligated service is waived.  Otherwise Airmen must have a service-directed reason IAW Table 5.9 or meet current Air Force reenlistment policy. (T-1). 7.3.3.  Airmen  are  allowed  to  project  their  reenlistment  6  months  in  advance  provided  the reenlistment occurs on the actual day or after the Airman reaches 19 years of TAFMS. (Note:  Airmen  receiving  a  bonus  from  a  previous  contract  will  not  have  the  remaining  obligated service waived and ADSC will be extended to coincide with the length of the bonus, i.e., SRB.) 7.3.4.  Contracts can be no less than 1 year and CSRB payments can be paid in lump sum or installments at the amount as indicated by PDUSD (P&R) and published in the Implementation Guidance. 7.3.5.  Eligible Airmen are authorized to extend to receive this bonus, provided the Airman has a service-directed reason to extend as shown in Table 6.2.  Airmen may elect to extend for longer periods even though less retainability is  required in order to qualify for the CSRB. (Note:  Airmen will not receive the bonus until they enter their extension.) 7.3.6.  Airmen will serve in the CSRB skill for the full period of the reenlistment or extension contract agreement, and incur an ADSC for that reenlistment or extension contract. (T-1). The ADSC will be based on the years reenlisting. 118 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 7.3.7.  HYT for mandatory retirements may be waived for Airmen authorized a CSRB, who agree  to  serve  in  the  designated  specialty  under  a  CSRB  contract.    Once  the  Airman  has completed the appropriate contract, the MPS or equivalent will be required to email AFPC Reenlistments requesting the Airman’s HYT be adjusted.  AFPC Reenlistments coordinates with AFPC Retirements for approval.   Once HYT has been adjusted by AFPC, the MPS or equivalent can then process the reenlistment/extension. 7.3.8.  Airmen may withdraw their retirement to reenlist and accept this bonus provided PCS funds were not expended. 7.4.  Required Documentation  :  7.4.1.  Reenlistment: The AF Form 901 documents the CSRB participation and entitlement (insert specific dollar amount of bonus from Implementation Guidance). 7.4.2.  Extension: The AF Form 1411 documents the CSRB participation and entitlement. The MPS documents the remarks Section XIV by inserting ―Airman is authorized $___ (insert specific  dollar  amount  of  bonus  from  Implementation  Guidance)  in  conjunction  with  the Critical Skills Retention Bonus Program. 7.4.3.  The MPS will: 7.4.3.1.  Forward all requests (to include the required documentation) to AFPC/ADSC OPS via current processing procedures. (T-1).  Follow contract disposition schedule as outlined in Table 5.10. 7.4.3.2.  Select “Critical Skills Ret Bonus (Enlisted)” for case type. (T-1). 7.4.3.3.  Annotate in the remarks “Member is authorized $_____ in conjunction with the Enlisted CSRB Program.”  The MPS will also state whether Airman requested lump sum or installments. (T-1). 7.4.3.4.  Indicate the ADSC end date. (T-1). This date equals DOE plus TOE years (months are not added). (Note:  The ADSC will include the full term and any remaining obligation from a previous Zone E/CSRB.) 7.4.3.5.  Include current reenlistment date and whether the Airman was in a combat zone during the month in which the reenlistment took place. (T-1). 7.5.  Recoupment  : When conditions warrant, any unearned CSRB may be recouped, terminated, or suspended, as applicable, applying rules in DoDFMR. 7.6.  Active  Duty  Service  Commitment  :  Once  an  Airman  accepts  the  CSRB  program, AFPC/ADSC  OPS  will  update  ADSC  69.  (T-1).  AFPC/ADSC  OPS  will  forward  to  AFPC Reenlistments  for  verification  and  processing  to  DFAS.  (T-1).    The  only  ADSC  waiver  for retirement that is applicable is for “hardship” as stated in AFI 36-3203.  (Note: see AFI 36-3203, paragraph 2.8.2, 2.10 and Table 2.2.) AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 119 Chapter 8 AIR FORCE RESERVE HIGH YEAR OF TENURE (HYT) PROCEDURES (AFR ONLY) 8.1.  HYT Program  . (T-2). It is designed to improve grade ratios, ensure sustained promotion opportunity, and maintain readiness by providing a force fit for the rigors of war. 8.2.  Service Limitation.  (T-2).  The HYT program limits participation for TRs, IMAs, PIRRs, and AGRs.  HYTD is the first day of the month following member’s pay date plus 33 years of creditable service for military pay (CSMP) or one day prior to age 60, whichever occurs first.  An ART’s service is limited to 33 years of CSMP or the date eligible for an unreduced civil service retirement, whichever date is later – not to exceed one day prior to age 60. 8.3.  Computing HYTD.  (T-2).  See Attachment 2 for HYTD computation. 8.4.  Update HYTD.  (T-2).   ARPC/DPT is the only agency authorized to update TRs, IMAs, PIRRs, and ARTs HYTD.  ARPC/DPA is the only agency authorized to update AGRs HYTD. 8.4.1.  The servicing MPS (Unit Program), RIO Detachments (IMA and PIRR Program) must notify ARPC/DPT, if they believe a HYTD is incorrect.  Notification will occur by e-mail. 8.5.  Adjustment  of  HYTD.  (T-2).    A  member’s  HYTD  is  adjusted  pursuant  to  sanctuary provisions (18 but less than 20 years of satisfactory service at HYTD) or when a member vacates or enters into ART status. 8.5.1.  Adjustment of HYTD pursuant to sanctuary provisions.  Members with 18 but less than 20 years of satisfactory service at their HYTD will have their HYTD adjusted to the first day following the month the member will obtain 20 years of satisfactory service.  However, during this time the member cannot have had an unsatisfactory year.  Commander input is not required to adjust their HYTD, because the adjustment of HYTD is pursuant to sanctuary provisions. 8.5.1.1.  A HYTD adjusted to allow a member to obtain 20 years satisfactory service will not be further adjusted, unless the member was precluded from satisfactory participation during the adjusted period due to circumstances beyond the member’s control. 8.5.2.  Adjustment  of  HYTD  based  on  member  vacating  ART  status  to  enter  AGR  tour.  Member’s HYTD is adjusted to first day of the month following member’s pay date plus 33 years of CSMP or one day prior to age 60, whichever occurs first. 8.5.2.1.  ARPC/DPT must adjust member’s HYTD. 8.5.2.2.  During processing of an ART’s application for an AGR tour, ARPC/DPT must ensure member’s adjusted HYTD is not a past date. 8.5.2.3.  If the adjusted HYTD is a past date, then ARPC/DPT must process a request for extension of HYTD to AFRC/CC (approval authority) for decision.  The request must be approved before the member enters AGR tour. 8.5.3.  Adjustment of HYTD based on member vacating ART status but remaining as a TR.   Member’s HYTD is adjusted to first day of the month following member’s pay date plus 33 years of CSMP or one day prior to age 60, whichever occurs first. 120 AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 8.5.3.1.  The  servicing  MPS  must  notify  ARPC/DPT  to  adjust  member’s  HYTD.  Notification will provide the date member vacated ART status.  Notification shall occur by email. 8.5.3.2.  If the adjusted HYTD is a past date, the member is not authorized to participate after  the  date  member  vacated  ART  status  and  the  member  must  separate  or  retire,  if eligible, not later than 120 days from the date member vacated ART status. 8.5.4.  Adjustment of HYTD based on member  entering ART status.  Member’s HYTD is adjusted to one of the following three options: first day of the month following member’s pay date  plus  33  years  of  CSMP  or  one  day  prior  to  age  60,  whichever  occurs  first,  Service Computation Date (SCD) plus 30 years, or DOB plus minimum civil service retirement age, whichever date is later – not to exceed one day prior to age 60. 8.5.4.1.  Servicing MPS must notify ARPC/DPT to adjust member’s HYTD.  Notification will provide the date member entered ART status.  Notification shall occur by email. 8.6.  Notification  to  Member  and  Commander  of  Approaching  HYTD.  (T-2).    Fourteen months prior to member’s HYTD, the servicing MPS (Unit Program), RIO Detachments (IMA and PIRR) or ARPC/DPA (AGR Program) must notify the member and the member’s commander of the member’s approaching HYTD.  The servicing MPS (Unit Program) must also notify the servicing Civilian Personnel Office (CPO) of an ART’s approaching HYTD so the CPO can enroll the ART in the DOD Priority Placement Program.  All notifications must be in writing. 8.6.1.  Upon notification of member’s approaching HYTD, the unit commander determines if a rare situation exists that warrants favorable consideration for extension of member’s HYTD to maintain unit readiness. 8.6.2.  The commander notifies the member and servicing MPS, RIO, or ARPC/DPA of the decision. Both notifications must be in writing no later than 12 months before the member’s HYTD. 8.7.  Extension of HYTD.  (T-2).  Members are considered for extension of HYTD on a case-by-case basis only when rare circumstances deem the member’s continued service essential to unit readiness.  Extensions are granted in one year increments not to exceed a combined total of 3 years or to one day prior to age 60, whichever occurs first. 8.7.1.  Requests for extension of a member’s HYTD will be initiated no later than 12 months before member’s HYTD and must arrive not later than 6 months prior to member’s HYTD.  Request for TRs, IMAs, PIRRs and ARTs are sent to ARPC/DPT.  Request for AGRs are sent to ARPC/DPA. 8.7.2.  AFRC/CC  is  the  approval  authority  for  extension  of  a  member’s  HYTD.    Any commander in a member’s chain of command can disapprove a request for extension of HYTD.  The decision is final and cannot be appealed. 8.7.3.  Commanders  must  fully  substantiate  why  the  member’s  service  is  essential  to  unit readiness.  The commander must provide unit and overall wing manning by grade (TSgt – CMSgt), by ART and non-ART, number of personnel in or awaiting formal school, and number of personnel in upgrade training to the 5- and 7-skill level. 8.7.4.  Requests  for  extension  of  HYTD  are  processed  through  the  member’s  chain  of command, to include the NAF for TRs and ARTs. AFI36-2606  27 JULY 2017 121 8.7.5.  ARPC/DPT (for TRs, IMAs, PIRRs and ARTs) and ARPC/DPA (for AGRs) obtains AFRC/CC’s  decision,  updates  approved  extension  to  HYTD,  and  notifies  the  servicing military personnel agency of AFRC/CC’s decision. 8.7.6.  The servicing MPS, RIO Detachment, or ARPC/DPT will notify the member and the member’s commanders of AFRC/CC’s decision. 8.8.  Withdrawal of Approved Extension of HYTD.  (T-2).  An approved extension of TRs, IMAs, PIRRs or AGRs HYTD can be withdrawn if the member has not entered into the HYTD extension. 8.8.1.  AFRC/CC is the approval authority for withdrawal of a member’s approved extension of HYTD.  Any commander in a member’s chain of command can disapprove a request for withdrawal of an approved extension of HYTD.  The decision is final and cannot be appealed. 8.8.2.  Commanders must fully substantiate why the member’s approved extension of HYTD must be withdrawn. 8.8.3.  Requests for withdrawal of an approved extension of HYTD are processed through the member’s chain of command, to include the NAF for TRs and ARTs, to ARPC/DPTTS (for TRs, IMAs, PIRRs and ARTs) or ARPC/DPA (for AGRs). 8.8.4.

The servicing MPS, RIO Detachment, or ARPC/DPT will notify the member and the member’s commanders of AFRC/CC’s decision. 8.8.6.  Enlisted members may not take part in the Selected Reserve past their HYTD.  Members will be transferred to the Retired Reserve, if eligible, or separated at their HYTD. 8.8.7.  TRs,  IMAs,  PIRRs,  and  AGRs  eligible  for  a  Reserve  Retirement  at  HYTD  will  be automatically transferred (transfer without member’s application for retirement) to the Retired Reserve.
