General  Information.  RED  HORSE  units  provide  civil  engineer  special capabilities  anywhere  in  the  world.  These  unique  capabilities  include  building roads, helicopter pads, taxiway ramps, and even large-scale operational airfields. Expeditionary  operations  like  these  require  high  quality  concrete,  asphalt,  base course,  and  surfacing  and  fill  material  to  complete.  These  materials  sometimes cannot  be  purchased  in  sufficient  quantities,  or  at  all,  within  a  reasonable distance  of  the  work  site.  When  that  situation  occurs,  RED  HORSE  can  move quickly to stand-up quarry and pit operations to provide the needed construction materials  (Figure  1.1).  Our  focus  here  is  to  provide  an  overview  of  the processes, materials, and heavy equipment used during RED HORSE quarry and pit operations. This publication is  nondirective. It does  not  replace information contained  in  technical  orders  (T.O.)  or  other  mandatory  instructions  vital  for quarry and pit operations, therefore users must refer to applicable directives and required  guidance  for  comprehensive  information  addressing  the  selection  and operation of quarries and pits. Figure 1.1. RED HORSE Quarry Operation.   AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  1.2. Scope. The information in this handbook relates to tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) use by civil engineers in supporting precepts outlined in Air Force Doctrine Volume 5, Support and Air Force Doctrine Annex (AFDA) 3-34, Engineer  Operations.  It  also  supports  implementation  of  Air  Force  Policy Directive  (AFPD)  10-2,  Readiness,  AFI  10-209,  RED  HORSE  Program,  and AFMAN  10-903,  Quarry  Operations.  This  association  is  illustrated  in  Figure 1.2, CE doctrine, policies, and guidance. 9 Figure 1.2. Core Doctrine and CE Policies and Guidance.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  10  1.3.  Roles  and  Responsibilities.  RED  HORSE  Squadrons  (RHS)  perform quarry  and  pit  operations  in  support  of  peacetime  and  contingency  operations. To  that  end,  selected  RED  HORSE  and  Prime  BEEF  personnel  are  trained  to perform  all  aspects  of  quarry  and  pit  operations,  including  blasting  operations (Figure 1.3). The 820th RHS at Nellis AFB, Nevada, is the lead training unit for quarry operations and has responsibility for training CE personnel in quarry and pit  operations.  Units  may  schedule  personnel  for  quarry  and  other  training through  the  AFCEC  CE  Contingency  Training  SharePoint  site  at  https://afcec-portal.lackland.af.mil/sites/CECT/SitePages/Home.aspx. Figure 1.3. Blaster Training in Support of Quarry Operations.   1.4.  Safety.  Like  any  other  engineer  operation  that  involves  the  use  of  heavy equipment, understanding and observing safety requirements during quarry and pit operations prevents injuries and saves lives. It is everyone’s responsibility to adhere to all related safety protocols and precautions.   1.5. Additional Information. Several resources was used in the development of this  handbook,  including  information  from  relevant  T.O.s,  AFMANs,  Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC), commercial equipment manuals, RED HORSE quarry course materials, and other resources. This handbook provides a basic overview  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  of  Air  Force  quarry  and  pit  operations.  Personnel  should  refer  to  applicable T.O.s, manuals and other approved guidance before performing any quarry or pit operation.

It does not  replace  policy  documents,  T.O.s,  manuals,  or  any applicable  mandatory  procedures  or  instructions.  Users must  review  applicable technical,  safety,  and  policy references before performing actual quarry or pit operations.       AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  12   Chapter 2 SITE SELECTION 2.1.  General  Information.  Significant  research  and  evaluation  is  usually  done before a quarry or pit site is finally selected. The selection process helps ensure the expected quality and quantity of construction material can be obtained from the  site.  This  chapter  provides  an  overview  of  basic  quarry  and  pit  selection factors,  however,  users  should  refer  to  applicable  technical  orders  and  other relevant guidance for specific site selection procedures. 2.2. Selection Process. Quarries and pits are classified according to the type of material  contained  in  them  and  the  methods  of  obtaining  the  materials  (Table 2.1). In general, a quarry is considered a facility that produces rock material for construction  through  blasting  and  cutting  operations.  Conversely,  pits  are facilities that produce earth or rock particles (soil) for construction by removal with  earthmoving  equipment.  For  many  good  reasons,  it  is  usually  more beneficial  to  use  an  existing  quarry  or  pit  capable  of  producing  the  required material, but when such sites are unavailable, other sources must be found. The site selection process involves both a preliminary and field reconnaissance. Table 2.1. Quarry and Pit Classifications and Use.

Preliminary  Reconnaissance.  The  preliminary  reconnaissance  typically consists  of  studying  information  sources  that  provide  clues  to  potential  mining sites. These resources include intelligence reports, satellite images, geologic and topographical  maps,  and  any  other  available  material.  However,  topographical maps  are  the  most  common  source  for  preliminary  information  and  planning. Local inhabitants can also be a good source of information. A combination of all these resources should help narrow the list of potential sites to the best possible candidates. 2.3.1.  Intelligence  Sources.  Intelligence  reports  from  the  Department  of Defense  (DOD)  and  other  federal  agencies  may  contain  information  on  soil types,  rock  formations,  and  existing  and  potential  quarry  locations  for  a particular  area.  Information  in  these  reports  comes  from  various  sources including reconnaissance personnel and units located in an area of interest. This information is especially useful prior to entering an area or sector.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  14   for resources 2.3.2.  Maps  and  Charts.  Geologic,  topographical,  and  agricultural  soil  maps are  excellent locating  existing  and  potential  quarries. Topographical  maps  indicate  the  location  of  streams,  roads,  hills,  cliffs,  and other  pertinent  terrain  features  (Figure  2.1).  Geologic  maps  often  contain information  on  existing  quarries  and  pits,  mining  districts,  haul  roads,  and surface  geology  including  vegetation.  Like  topographical  maps,  they  may  also provide  information  on  terrain  elevation  and  drainage.  The  Department  of Interior United States Geological Survey (USGS) maintains a large repository of map data and is a great resource for beginning preliminary reconnaissance. Figure 2.1. Topographical Maps Indicate Terrain Features.  2.3.3.  Satellite  Images  and  Aerial  Photographs.  When  used  in  conjunction with other information, satellite images and aerial photographs can help analyze surface  features  including  the  location  of  quarries,  pits,  and  rock  formations. Imagery  from  the  command’s  installation  geospatial  information  and  services (IGI&S) may also be useful in locating potential mining sites. 2.3.4.  Local  Inhabitants.  Local  people,  particularly  surveyors,  engineers, miners,  contractors,  and  quarrymen,  can  provide  useful  data  on  local  geology and  possible  engineering  problems.  In  addition,  farmers  are  usually  a  good source of information because they are very familiar with local land conditions.  15 AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  2.4. Field Reconnaissance. Following preliminary reconnaissance assessment, a field  reconnaissance  at  the  potential  quarry  or  pit  site  is  used  to  verify  initial research  and  obtain  additional  information  on  the  quality  and  quantity  of construction  material,  and  other  factors  that  may  affect  excavation  operations (Figure  2.2).  If  checking  an  existing  quarry  or  pit  that  has  been  abandoned, determine  why  it  was  no  longer  being  used  (i.e.,  project  completed,  excessive water,  quality  of  material,  etc.).  Engineers  should  maintain  meticulous  records during  the  field  investigation  because  the  information  will  likely  influence  the final  site  selection.  Include  any  pertinent  data  annotated  on  geologic  and topographical  maps,  geospatial  information  systems  (GIS)  overlays,  or  aerial imagery  used  during  the  investigation.  Field  reconnaissance  techniques  can include  boring,  probing,  drilling,  and  excavating.  Field  reconnaissance  should be conducted IAW American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D5434, Standard Guide for Field Logging of Subsurface Explorations of Soil and Rock as  well  as  ASTM  D420,  Standard  Guide  to  Site  Characterization  for Engineering,  Design,  and  Construction  Purposes.  If  the  quarry  will  produce aggregates  for  concrete  pavements,  fine  and  coarse  aggregate  should  be  tested separately in accordance to ASTM C 1260 if possible. If the expansion  is 0.08 percent  or  more  in  28  days  then  mitigation  measure  are  required.  If  the  quarry will  produce  aggregates  for  concrete  pavements,  fine  and  coarse  aggregate should be tested separately in accordance to ASTM C 1260. Figure 2.2. Field Reconnaissance Confirms Site Data.     AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  16  2.4.1.  Boring.  Boring  is  accomplished  either  mechanically  or  by  hand.  It consists  of  drilling,  cutting,  sinking,  or  enlarging  a  vertical  hole  in  the  earth’s surface  deep  enough  to  provide  desired  information.  Boring  should  be conducted  IAW  ASTM  D1452,  Standard  Practice  for  Soil  Exploration  and Sampling by Auger Borings. 2.4.2. Probing. Probing is also accomplished either mechanically or by hand. It involves  driving  a  steel  rod  through  the  ground’s  surface  while  observing  the penetration  resistance.  The  probing  depth  is  limited  to  the  length  of  the  probe rod.  For  expedient  field  characterization,  probing  is  most  often  accomplished utilizing a Dynamic Cone Penetrometer. 2.4.3. Drilling. Drilling involves the cutting and recovery of core samples. It is similar to boring except that drilling forces residue into a tube that is brought to the  surface.  Core  drilling  allows  the  encountered  strata  to  be  sampled,  tested, and observed. A jackhammer can be used for shallow drilling. Drilling should be conducted  IAW  ASTM  D2113  Standard  Practice  for  Rock  Core  Drilling  and Sampling of Rock for Site Investigation. Maintaining proper drilling logs is not only critical for initial field reconnaissance, but provides invaluable information for follow-on blasting efforts. 2.4.4. Excavating. Excavating is an expedient method of site testing. Vertically excavating test pits and trenches exposes the subsurface materials and allows for in-place examination. Excavating is a reliable way to determine the occurrence, composition,  distribution,  structure,  and  stability  of  material  deposits.  While constructing  test  pits,  care  should  be  taken  to  not  to  disturb  the  soil  of underlying  layers  for  sampling  purposes.  Test  pits  should  be  a  minimum  of  1 meter  by  1  meter  square  and  stepped  to  the  appropriate  depth,  as  governed  by the  exploration.    Shoring  may  be  required  if  test  pits  are  constructed  over  ten feet in depth. 2.5. Site Selection and Associated Factors. Several factors effect site selection and subsequent quarry and pit operations. These factors include the type, quality and  quantity  of  construction  materials,  ground  and  surface  water  conditions, overburden,  utilities,  security,  type  of  equipment,  personnel  training  and qualification, communications, etc. These and other factors are addressed below.  17 AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  2.5.1. Quarry Materials (Rocks). Understanding the basic geology of rocks is essential  to  evaluate  potential  quarry  sites.  Construction  materials  excavated from quarries  may include various forms and classifications of rocks. The type of  rock  present  and  their  specific  engineering  properties  will  determine  site suitability. In general, rock shall be described using the following parameters (at a  minimum):  rock  type,  color,  textural  characteristics  such  as  grain  size  and crystalline  matrix,  bedding  thickness,  bedding  attitude  (degree  or  angle  of  dip, strike  direction,  etc.),  hardness,  and  any  supplementary  descriptions  such  as broken, fractured, jointed, weathered, water-stained, etc. 2.5.1.1. Rock Classifications and Properties. Rocks are generally classified into three  categories:  igneous,  sedimentary,  and  metamorphic.  These  rocks  are usually  composed  of  several  different  minerals.  For  example,  granite  is  a granular igneous rock composed primarily of quartz and potassium feldspar, but portions  of  other  minerals  will  likely  be  present.  See  Table  2.2  for  a  list  of common rock classifications and properties. 2.5.1.1.1. Igneous rocks were formed by the release and cooling of molten rock material  from  within  the  earth’s  mantle.  However,  the  mineral  and  chemical composition, texture, and mode of occurrence of igneous rocks can vary greatly. 2.5.1.1.2. Sedimentary rock results from the consolidation of loose sediment that has  accumulated  in  layers,  either  by  mechanical,  chemical,  or  organic  means. Clastic  rock  consists  of  mechanically  formed  fragments  of  older  rock transported from its source and deposited in water or from air or ice. Chemical rock  (such  as  gypsum)  formed  by  precipitation  from  solution.  Organic  rock (such  as  certain  limestones)  consists  of  the  remains  or  secretions  of  plants  or animals. 2.5.1.1.3.  Metamorphic  rock  is  any  rock  derived  from  preexisting  rocks  by mineralogical,  chemical,  or  structural  changes,  essentially  in  the  solid  state,  in response  to  marked  changes  in  temperature,  pressure,  shearing  stress,  and chemical environment, generally at depth in the Earth’s crust.     AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  18  Table 2.2. Rock Classifications and Properties.  Igneous Granite   (Image Copyrighted 2004, see Note 1) Diorite Properties2 An igneous rock with an even texture. Granite is gray, pink, or red, with crushing strength ranging from 15,000 to 30,000 pounds per square inch. Unweathered granites are strong and durable rock suitable for bridge piers, sea walls, and foundations of buildings. Its chief defect is that when heated and chilled, the quartz and feldspar grains expand or contract at different rates sometimes causing the rock surface to crumble or peel. Diorites are a family of rocks that resemble dark granite and found most often in sills, dikes, and small stocks. Unweathered diorites are strong and durable and have an average compressive strength of 28,000 pounds per square inch. Gabbro   Gabbro is a dark gray, green, or black granular rock similar in appearance to diorites. Like granite, gabbro is found in batholiths, but it also forms small stocks, dikes, sills, and volcanic necks. Gabbro which is a durable construction material for all purposes, has a high degree of compressive strength (average is 26,000 per square inch), and low absorbability. Gabbro is chiefly used for road materials.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  Table 2.2. (Continued) 19 Felsites  Basalts  (Image Copyrighted 2006, see Note 1)  Sedimentary Limestone (Image Copyrighted 2008, see Note 1)  Felsites are a group of very dense, fine-grained, extrusive igneous rocks. They have dull, stony textures and are composed of quartz and feldspars. Colors range from light or medium gray to pink, brown, yellow, purplish, and light green. Weathering causes Felsites to become brown, rusty and crumble, eventually breaking down completely to become clay. Felsites are generally used as concrete aggregate. Basalts are a group of very dense fine-grained igneous rocks whose colors range from black to dark gray to green to purplish. All basalts contain a great deal of lime, magnesium, and iron. They are a fine-grained equivalent of Gabbro and are closely related to the andesites. Properties2 Any rock that contains more than 50 percent calcium carbonate in the form of calcite is considered limestone. When pure, limestones are white or colored, but they are usually colored gray to black by carbon or stained buff, yellow, red, or brown by iron oxides. Crushed limestone is used in the manufacture of Portland cement.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  20   Table 2.2. (Continued) Dolomite Sometimes similar in appearance and usage to limestone, dolomite is a calcium magnesium carbonate of varying proportions. (Image Copyrighted 2006, see Note 1)  Chert and Flint Siliceous sediments are usually found in limestone and shale. They are very hard and difficult to drill. Chert can be used as a satisfactory road material. (Image Copyrighted 2005, see Note 1)  Rock Salt Rock salt is very abundant, soluble in wa-ter, and very soft. Rock salt deposits are of no value as a construction material.      AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  Table 2.2.

It is usually susceptible to rapid weathering and consequent weakness. Diamictite is a rock made up of poorly sorted rock fragments of various types and sizes and mixed with finer grained sedimentary material. It is normally a good source of material for earth dams and embankments, but usually not suitable for concrete and bituminous aggregates.

(Continued) Sandstone (Image Copyrighted 2008, see Note 1)  Siltstone Sandstone consists of small grains (1/16 millimeter to 2 millimeters) that have been cemented together to form rock. The color of sandstone depends on the nature of the cement. Iron oxides give the red, yellow, and brown shades. Sandstone that splits easily into even slabs is known as flagstone. Flagstone is commonly used as a decorative building material. Siltstone is similar to sandstone, but composed mainly of cemented particles that are between 1/256 and 1/16 millimeter in diameter. (Image Copyrighted 2007, see Note 1)  Shale Shales and clays are made up of clay minerals, various oxides, silica, fine particles of ordinary minerals, and a greater or lesser amount of colloidal and organic material.      AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  Table 2.2. (Continued) 23 Metamorphic Properties2 Gneiss (Image Copyrighted 2008, see Note 1)  Schists  (Image Copyrighted 2006, see Note 1) Slate Gneiss is a banded rock of granite composition, containing quartz, feldspar, and mica. Their banded structure enables the rock to be split into essentially parallel surfaces allowing its use in the construction of tough walls and some road surfaces. Schist has much finer texture than gneiss and possesses a well-marked cleavage. Unlike gneisses, their bands are mineralogically alike causing treacherous rock slips in quarries, rock cuts, and in tunnels if unsupported on steep or vertical faces. Slate is a fine grained, hard, and dense rock. It splits easily into thin layers that cut across bedding planes. The most important feature of slate is its cleavage, which makes it valuable for roofing. Although not recommended, it can be used as a road material if necessary.

(Continued) Quartzite (Image Copyrighted 2008, see Note 1)  Marble Primarily, quartzite is metamorphosed sandstone. Other minerals are present as impurities and give the rock a pink, brownish, or red brick color. Similar in appearance to grainy limestone, quartzite is much harder. Quartzite is not used as building stone due to shattering during jointing, but when crushed, becomes good material for concrete work, railroad ballast, and roadwork. Marble is the result of the metamorphism of limestone and dolomite. When crushed and used as an aggregate, marble has the same value as limestone. (Image Copyrighted 2008, see Note 1)  Notes: 1.

In all cases, rock properties can and will vary significantly within the same rock grouping.      25 AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  2.5.1.2.  Rock  Structure.  Rock  structure  refers  to  the  natural  arrangement  or presentation  of  rock  deposits.  Understanding  these  structures  is  important  to efficient rock excavation. Many rocks form in broad, flat layers called beds that stack up like layers of a cake. In some places, these rocks remain in their flat and level  orientation.  In  other  places,  geological  stresses  tilt,  bend  and  break  these rock  formations.  The  arrangement  of  rock  structures  are  generally  defined  in terms  of  strike  and  dip,  faults,  folds,  and  joints.  Each  of  these  structures  is briefly  described  below.  Users  should  refer  to  applicable  technical  orders  and manuals for detailed information.  2.5.1.2.1.  Strike  and  Dip.  Tilted  and  inclined  rock  beds  are  indicated  by  strike and  dip  lines  on  geologic  maps.  The  strike  is  the  line  of  intersection  of  an inclined  layer  of  rock  (geologic  plane)  with  a  horizontal  plane  (Figure  2.3). Engineers usually determine the strike orientation of an area during preliminary reconnaissance or when boring and excavating during field reconnaissance. The dip also provides insight into the rock  structure of a particular area. The dip is the  acute  angle  between  the  geologic  plane  and  the  horizontal  plane.  As illustrated in Figure 2.3, it is a vertical angle measured at right angles from the strike  line.  The  strike  and  dip  information  can  be  used  during  quarry  layout  to optimize  blasting  and  drilling  efforts  and  minimize  quarry  overhang  and  slope instability. Figure 2.3. Strike and Dip.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  26  2.5.1.2.2. Faults and Folds. Faults are fractures in the rock structure that cause displacement  of  the  rock  parallel  to  the  fracture  plane  (Figure  2.4).  Faults  are commonly recognized on rock outcrop surfaces by the relative displacement of strata  on  opposite  sides  of  the  fault  plane.  Folds  are  undulating  (rising  and falling)  surface  expressions  caused  by  bending  and  crumpling  of  the  rock structure.  There  are  several  basic  types  of  folds,  four  of  them  as  illustrated  in Figure 2.5. 2.5.1.2.3. Joints. Joints are rock masses that fracture in such a way that there is little  or  no  displacement  parallel  to  the  fractured  surface  (Figure  2.6).  Joints influence  the  way  the  rock  mass  behaves  when  subjected  to  the  stresses  of construction.  Joints  may  result  from  a  number  of  processes,  including deformation, expansion, and contraction. Figure 2.4. Faulting and Fault Zones.     AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  Figure 2.5. Common Folds. Figure 2.6. Jointing in Sedimentary and Igneous Rocks.  27    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  28  2.5.1.3.  Relative  Hardness  Factors.  Determining  the  hardness  of  rocks  helps engineers  identify  certain  minerals  during  field  evaluations.  Minerals  can  be extremely  hard,  very  soft  or  anywhere  in  between.  The  following  paragraphs highlight  relative  hardness  factors  relating  to  certain  minerals  and  common objects.  Generally,  harder  objects  should  be  able  to  scratch  softer  objects. However,  enough  pressure  must  be  applied  to  make  the  scratch,  especially  if objects  are  closely  related  on  the  hardness  scale.  Refer  to  AFMAN  10-903  for additional information on relative hardness factors.  2.5.1.4.  Mohs  Scale  of  Relative  Hardness.  In  the  early  1800s,  mineralogist Friedrich Mohs developed a chart of relative hardness for various minerals. The Mohs  Scale  of  Relative  Hardness  (Table  2.3)  is  still  valid  today.  It  lists  the relative  hardness  of  selected  minerals  from  the  hardest  (#10-Diamond)  to  the softest  (#1-Talc).  For  example,  diamonds  are  harder  than  quartz,  therefore diamonds  will  scratch  quartz;  quartz  will  scratch  calcite;  calcite  will  scratch gypsum; and so on. Table 2.3. Mohs Scale of Relative Hardness. Mineral Relative Hardness Diamond Corundum Topaz  Quartz Feldspar Apatite  Fluorite  Calcite Gypsum  Talc 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  29 AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  2.5.1.5.  Expedient  Scale  of  Relative  Hardness.  With  the  Mohs  scale,  mineral hardness is measured by the ability of one mineral to scratch another. However, in  lieu  of  using  a  mineral  to  check  another,  common  household  items  can  be used  if  their  relative  hardness  is  known.  The  expedient  scale  (Table  2.4) provides  the  relative  hardness  of  ordinary  items  such  as  a  fingernail,  copper penny,  pocketknife  blade,  etc.  The  relative  hardness  of  rocks  is  estimated  by scratching  it  with  the  items  listed  in  the  expedient  scale.  For  example,  if  a  file scratches  a  rock,  the  rock’s  relative  hardness  is  below  6.5  on  the  Mohs  scale (softer  than  Quartz);  if  the  rock  scratches  the  file,  the  relative  hardness  of  the rock is above 6.5; and if the rock scratches a pocketknife blade, but not the file, the rock’s relative hardness is between 5.0 and 6.5.  Table 2.4. Expedient Scale of Relative Hardness. Item Relative  Hardness Scratch Reaction Porcelain Steel file Pocket knife blade or nail Copper coin Fingernail 7.0 6.5 5.0 3.0 2.5 Porcelain will scratch “quartz” and below. Steel file will scratch "feldspar" on down in the Mohs scale. Minerals above "feldspar" will scratch the file. Pocketknife will scratch "apatite" and below. Copper coin will scratch "calcite" and below. Fingernail will scratch "gypsum" and below.      AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  30  2.5.1.6.  Rock  Construction  Quality.  The  physical  and  chemical  properties  of rocks  determine  how  suitable  they  are  for  a  particular  construction  need  or project. Some rocks may be good aggregates for concrete or asphalt production, while others are more suited as a base course or subbase for road construction. Consequently, determining the quality of the available construction material is a key  step  during  site  selection.  Table  2.5  lists  various  rock  types  and  their suitability for different construction requirements. Table 2.5. Aggregate for Military Construction.

These are known to have caused alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in the past.  Some rock types that have not been identified as ASR susceptible can be susceptible if they contain the following minerals: Crisobalite, Strained quartz, Cryptocrystalline (or microcrystalline) quartz opal or volcanic glass (obsidian).  **Anti-stripping agents should be used.  31 AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  2.5.1.7. Rock Quantity and Weight. Estimating the amount of rock material in a specific  quarry  is  another  important  factor  during  site  selection.  The  quarry should  have  enough  material  to  sustain  the  anticipated  operation.  Rock  quarry material is usually calculated in tons per cubic yard. Estimating the quantity of usable  material  can  be  accomplished  by  multiplying  the  average  depth  of  the quarry  face  by  the  working  area  and  then  subtracting  the  overlying  waste  rock and  overburden.  Table  2.6  lists  estimated  in-place  weights  and  quantities  for various types of rocks. Table 2.6. Rock Quantity and Weight Estimates.

NOTE: Actual values in the field may vary up to 10% from the values shown here    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  32  2.5.2.  Pit  Materials  (Earth  and  Rock  Particles).  A  wide  variety  of  natural material  can  be  extracted  from  pits  and,  thus,  it  is  necessary  to  select  the appropriate  soil  and  location  to  match  the  intended  product.  For  example, borrow pits  may provide construction  material suitable  for select  fill,  surfacing or  blending  but  are  typically  a  poor  source  for  high-quality  base  course. Similarly, an alluvial (deposited by water) pit can be a quality source of gravel and  sand  for  paving  aggregate  but  may  also  require  crushing,  screening  and/or washing  operations  to  meet  specifications.  Classification  of  the  intended  soil using the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) is a simple, effective way to  determine  the  expected  engineering  properties  of  the  pit  material.  The individual  solid  particles  in  a  soil  have  different  sizes  and  shapes,  and  these characteristics  have  a  significant  effect  on  its  engineering  behavior.  Natural materials from pits may include any combination of the following USCS particle sizes: 2.5.2.1. Rock Fragments. Particles larger than 3 inches (76.2 mm) are known as rock fragments (boulders and cobbles). Rock fragments must usually be crushed further for engineering applications. 2.5.2.2. Gravels. An unconsolidated, natural accumulation  of typically rounded rock  fragments  resulting  from  erosion,  consisting  predominately  of  particles larger  than  sand  such  as  boulders,  cobbles,  pebbles,  granules,  or  any combination  of  these  fragments.  Gravels  range  in  size  from  4.76  to  76 millimeters. 2.5.2.3.  Sands.  Sands  are  unconsolidated  or  moderately  consolidated sedimentary  deposits  consisting  of  medium-grained  clastics.  The  material  is most  commonly  composed  of  quartz.  When  the  term  sand  is  used  without qualification, a siliceous composition is implied, but the particles may be of any mineral composition of rock or mineral fragments. Particle diameters range from 0.02 to 2 millimeters. 2.5.2.4. Silts. Silts are unconsolidated or moderately unconsolidated sedimentary deposits  consisting  essentially  of  fine-grained  clastics.  Silts  range  in  diameter from 0.002 to 0.02 mm.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  2.5.2.5.  Clays.  Clay  is  a  naturally  occurring  material  composed  primarily  of fine-grained  minerals.  These  cohesive  particles  have  diameters  less  than  0.074 millimeters and pass the U.S. standard sieve number 200. 33 2.5.3. Products. The following are typical products of quarry and pit materials: 2.5.3.1.  Pavement  Aggregates.  Coarse  aggregates  (gravels)  and  fine  aggregates (sands) are required for production of asphalt and concrete pavements.  2.5.3.1.1. Angularity, as measured by the percentage of fractured rock faces, is a critical  component  to  the  strength  of  asphalt.  The  interlocking  friction  of  its aggregate  provides  asphalt’s  strength.  Using  non-angular  (rounded)  aggregates in  asphalt  will  result  in  a  low-strength  mix  vulnerable  to  rutting.  However,  the angularity  of  aggregate  in  concrete  is  not  as  important  because  aggregate primarily functions as filler inside the concrete. Using non-angular aggregates in concrete  will  result  in  lower  concrete  flexural  strengths  (for  the  same compressive strength) but increased workability. 2.5.3.1.2.  The  percentage  of  fine-grained  soils,  or  “fines”  in  the  aggregate required to meet specifications differ between asphalt and concrete. Asphalt mix designs typically specify from 3 to 6 percent fines in the combined gradation of the  aggregate.  Concrete  mix  designs  typically  have  less  than  2  percent  fines  in the  combined  aggregate  gradation.  Excessive  fines  coat  the  aggregate  in concrete  and  reduce  the  bonding  strength  of  the  cement.  The  low  amount  of fines required in concrete usually necessitates an aggregate-washing operation. 2.5.3.2.  Base  Courses.  An  aggregate  base  course  is  usually  required  beneath both asphalt and concrete pavements. 2.5.3.2.1.  The  design  strength  of  base  course  underlying  asphalt  typically depends  on  the  angularity  of  the  aggregate.  A  higher  percentage  of  fractured faces results in an increased design strength. However, the angularity of the base course  underlying  concrete  is  not  an  important  factor  in  concrete  pavement design. 2.5.3.2.2.  The  percentage  of  fine-grained  soils,  or  “fines”,  in  base  course underlying asphalt must be less than 8 percent. Excessive fines in base courses   AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  34  result  in  a  significant  loss  of  strength  when  wet.  For  base  course  underlying concrete,  the  fines  specification  is  relaxed  to  less  than  15  percent.  Base  course under  concrete  requires  less  strength  due  to  the  distribution  of  load  across  the concrete  slab.  Material  requirements  for  airfield  asphalt  and  concrete  base courses can be found in UFC 03-260-02. 2.5.3.2.3.  Before  use  as  either  an  Aggregate  Base  Course  (ABC)  or  a  Graded-Crushed  Aggregate  Base  Course  (GCA),  sand  and  gravel  mixtures  should  be evaluated  for  suitability  according  to  Unified  Facilities  Guide  Specifications (UFGS) 32 11 23, Aggregate and/or Graded-Crushed Aggregate Base Course. 2.5.3.3.  Subbases.  Subbase  materials  consist  of  naturally  occurring  coarse-grained soils or blended and processed soils. Subbases are placed beneath a base course  but  above  the  subgrade  (existing  material)  in  an  asphalt  pavement system. The percentage of fines is required to be less than 15 percent. Material requirements for airfield subbases can be found in UFC 03-260-02. 2.5.3.4.  Aggregate  Surface  Courses.  An  aggregate  surface  course  is  the  top  6 inches  of  a  pavement  system  without  asphalt  or  concrete,  such  as  an  assault strip.  Material  used  as  a  surface  course  must  be  cohesive  enough  to  resist  the abrasive action of surface wear. Therefore, the percentage of fines is required to be  between  8  to  15  percent.  See  UFC  03-260-02  for  additional  material requirements for airfield aggregate surface courses. 2.5.4.  Groundwater  and  Surface  Water.  Another  important  site  selection factor, surface water and groundwater conditions at potential quarry and pit sites can affect anticipated mining operations. Field evaluations typically use test pits and borings to determine the approximate amount of groundwater and depth of the water table. 2.5.5. Drainage. While some gravel pits can be worked wet, most quarries and pits are usually worked in dry conditions; however, seepage and rainwater could fill  subsurface  quarries  and  pits,  so  the  ability  to  drain  off  standing  or  surface water  should  be  evaluated.  Extensive  drainage  projects,  such  as  diverting  a stream or draining a lake, should only be undertaken in extreme cases when an emergency operation is necessary and when no other sites are available.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  2.5.6.  Location  and  Roads.  Consider  the  location  of  the  potential  site.  The quarry or pit operation should be as close as possible to the construction site and convenient  to  good  routes  of  transportation.  Loaded  vehicles  should  move downhill whenever possible and the grades should not exceed ten percent. 35 2.5.7. Overburden. The amount of overburden can also influence the selection decision.  Overburden  is  the  barren  rock  material,  either  loose  or  consolidated, overlying  a  mineral  deposit,  which  must  be  removed  prior  to  mining.  Sites containing quality materials with the least overburden are the most desirable.  2.5.8. Equipment. Heavy construction machinery like drilling, digging, hauling, scraping, crushing, and screening equipment is a necessary part of everyday life in  an  active  quarry  or  pit  operation  (Figure  2.7).  Therefore,  equipment availability  is  an  important  factor  during  site  selection.  Whatever  equipment  is used, it should match the type and anticipated level of operation. For example, it may be inefficient to use big loaders with small dumps or small loaders with big crushers  because  the  equipment  is  not  suited  for  the  task.  See  Chapter  4  for additional  information  on  heavy  equipment  used  during  quarry  and  pit operations. Figure 2.7. Consider Heavy Equipment During Site Selection.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  36  2.5.9.  Utilities.  Electrical  and  water  utilities  increase  the  operational  efficiency of  mining  operations.  Electricity  for  lighting  is  essential  for  efficient  and  safe operations. In addition to being a logistical benefit, the correct electrical voltage and frequency (hertz) provides a more reliable source of power for crushing and screening  plant  operations.  Also,  consider  the  power  requirements  for  the utilities  when  planning  for  pit  and  quarry  operations.  In  addition  to  being  a logistical benefit, the correct electrical voltage and frequency (hertz) provides a more  reliable  source  of  power  for  crushing  and  screening  plant  operations.    If prime  power  is  available,  less  fuel  may  be  required  to  keep  crushing  and screening equipment running, while lowering emissions. Clean water is vital for cleaning and  maintaining equipment. It is also critical  when aggregate  must be washed for concrete and bituminous uses. 2.5.10.  Training.  While  equipment  is  important,  it  takes  skilled  personnel  to operate  the  equipment  and  produce  the  required  material.  Training  is  another key  factor  for  quarry  and  pit  operations.  Having  properly  trained  and  qualified personnel  helps  to  achieve  production  goals.  Conversely,  improper  training increases  the  likelihood  of  accidents  and  slows  production  output.  The  RED HORSE  quarry  and  pit  operations  training  CE  personnel  receive  is  crucial  to producing highly skilled crews needed for these operations. 2.5.11.  Security.  The  ability  to  secure  essential  equipment  items  (including explosives)  from  theft  and  enemy  action  is  an  important  concern.  Protection might include fencing, lighting, guards, and concertina wire, etc. 2.5.12. Communications. Radio frequency transmitting (including citizen band radios,  cellular  telephones,  AM  and  FM  radios,  radar,  and  television) communication  devices  can initiated  blasting operations and cause an undue hazard to personnel. Any communication devices utilized  in  a  quarry  or  pit  should  be  certified  for  use  IAW  Mine  Safety  and Health  Administration  (MSHA)  or  Department  of  Defense  Standards,  as appropriate. interfere  with  electrically 2.6. Final Selection. Following completion of the field reconnaissance, engineer planners  should  have  most,  if  not  all  of  the  information  needed  to  finish  their analysis  and  make  the  final  site  selections.  The  preplanning  research,  37 AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  preliminary  and  field  reconnaissance,  and  tactical  considerations  all  provide planners  with  important  data  about  potential  quarry  and  pit  site  operations. Specifically,  the  quantity  and  quality  of  the  minerals  anticipated,  location information,  potential  site  layout  factors,  equipment,  and  personnel  required  to operate the site, and possible challenges to quarry or pit production (Figure 2.8). During  the  final  analysis,  the  preferred  or  best  sites  should  eventually  become clear.  For  additional  information  on  quarry  and  pit  site  selection,  refer  to AFMAN 10-903.

The  ultimate  goal  of  RED  HORSE  quarry  and  pit operations  is  to  produce  the  greatest  amount  of  quality  material,  in  the  least amount  of  time,  with  the  minimum  amount  of  effort.  Effective  site  layout  and development  helps  satisfy  that  goal  (Figure  3.1).  This  chapter  provides  an overview  of  basic  quarry  and  pit  layout  and  development.  However,  users should refer to applicable T.O.s and  manuals  for specific  quarry and pit layout procedures. Figure 3.1. Effective Site Layout leads to Efficient Production.  3.2. Layout Planning. Quarry and pit layout involves planning the dimensions and  arrangement  of  the  quarry  or  pit,  the  shape  and  orientation  of  supporting roads,  and  the  location  and  positioning  of  large  support  equipment  (crushers, screening plants, etc.). The type of quarry or pit will also influence the eventual layout.  After  the  layout  has  been  determined,  an  operational  plan  should  be prepared  to  address  quarry  or  pit  development,  excavation  operations,  specific handling  material,  and  crushing  and  screening  operations.  Additionally,  a training plan should be developed in order to ensure all personnel working at the quarry  or  pit  is  given  orientation  training.  The  training  should  include  an introduction  to  the  work  environment;  the  authority  and  responsibility  of  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  supervisors;  proper  ways  to  enter  and  leave  the  quarry  or  pit;  transportation;  communications;  emergency  evacuation  procedures;  barricading  procedures; hazard  recognition;  accident  prevention;  emergency  medical  procedures;  and health and safety aspects of assigned tasks IAW with MSHA Standards. 39 3.3. Quarry Layout Factors.  3.3.1.  Quarry  Types.  Quarries  may  consist  of  hard,  medium  or  soft  rock.  The three basic types of quarries are hillside, subsurface, and terrain.  3.3.1.1.  Hillside  quarries  are  constructed  in  rock  that  is  part  of  the  structural geology of a hill (Figure 3.2). 3.3.1.2.  A  subsurface  quarry  is  one  that  is  opened  below  the  level  of  the surrounding terrain (Figure 3.3).  3.3.1.3. A terrain quarry is a temporary operation in which the existing terrain is lowered  or  leveled  (such  as  the  excavation  of  a  roadway  through  a  rock formation).  Since  this  handbook  focuses  on  the  production  of  construction materials, only hillside and subsurface quarries are addressed. Table 3.1 lists the advantages and disadvantages of hillside and subsurface quarries. Figure 3.2. Hillside Quarry.   AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  40   Figure 3.3. Subsurface Quarry. Table 3.1. Quarry Advantages and Disadvantages.  Hillside Quarry Advantages Disadvantages   Natural  drainage  and  gravity the  material  flow effecting from the quarry face   Removal of overburden   Grade or steepness of haul roads   Highly visible operations   Noise radiating from the site   Susceptibility to severe weather   Necessity of bench operations Subsurface Quarry   Masked from view   Removal of material (overburden   Less noise   Provides some protection from severe weather /aggregate) below grade and disposition above grade   Does not naturally drain  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  3.3.2.  Quarry  Dimensions.  Before  beginning  a  quarry  operation,  the  quarry boundaries should be marked. There are a number of factors that will determine these  dimensions:  the  amount  of  material  required,  land  boundaries,  and  the proximity  of  inhabited  structures  that  could  receive  damage  during  blasting operations. 41 3.3.2.1.  Material  Required.  The  amount  of  material  required  for  RED  HORSE construction  projects  generally  determines  the  size  quarry  needed.  When calculating  material  requirements,  you  should  include  an  appropriate  safety margin for unforeseen changes in rock quality, voids, the presence of water, and other  conditions.  There  are  different  methods  to  calculate  the  quantity  of  rock material in a quarry. One method is described in paragraph 2.5.1.7. 3.3.2.2. Land Boundaries. Whether in a large or small area, land boundaries can ultimately  affect  the  dimensions  of  potential  quarries.  Ignoring  boundaries  or conducting excavation beyond allowable land boundaries could be costly to the government or produce other consequences and should be avoided. 3.3.2.3.  Proximity  of  Inhabited  Structures.  When  quarry  operations  involve blasting,  the  proximity  of  inhabited  structures  may  also  affect  quarry dimensions.  When  determining  required  separation  distances  for  inhabited structures,  operators  must  consult  AFMAN  91-201  and  other  applicable guidance. 3.3.3.  Drainage.  The  quarry  floor  should  slope  away  from  the  quarry  face  so water does not accumulate in the working area. Try to eliminate excess water by natural drainage since pumping can be a costly alternative. For hillside quarries, natural  drainage  is  a  significant  benefit.  However,  in  the  case  of  subsurface quarries, if natural drainage or sumps are not an option, removing excess water by pumping may be necessary. 3.4. Pit Layout Factors. 3.4.1.  Pit  Types.  Similar  to  quarries,  the  type  of  pit  affects  the  eventual  site layout.  As  addressed  in  Chapter  2,  pits  generally  fall  into  four  categories; borrow,  gravel,  alluvial  gravel,  and  miscellaneous  gravel  or  dump  pits.  This section addresses layout of two major pit categories—borrow and gravel pits.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  42  3.4.1.1. Borrow pits generally provide unconsolidated earth (dirt, sand, etc.) for fill, surfacing or blending material.  3.4.1.2.  Conversely,  gravel  pits  usually  provide  unconsolidated  rock  particles (gravel,  thick-grained  sand,  and  clay)  for  surfacing  secondary  roads,  base courses  for  roads,  taxiways,  and  runways  and  as  aggregate  in  concrete  and asphalt construction. While unconsolidated earth or rock particles can usually be removed  from  pits  without  blasting,  in  some  cases,  this  material  may  be  too consolidated and require blasting to remove.  3.4.2.  Pit  Dimensions.  Determining  the  working  dimensions  of  the  area  to  be developed  is  fundamental  to  pit  layout.  Area  boundaries  or  limits  should  be sufficient  for  planned  excavation  methods,  equipment  positioning  and maneuvering,  placement  of  overburden,  and  supporting  structures.  When determining pit layout and dimensions, consider the following:   Is the pit on a slope or on level terrain? Is the pit worked wet or dry?   What excavation method will be used (scrapers, excavators, bulldozers, front-end loaders, etc.)?    Where  will  additional  equipment  (loading,  crushing,  screening  or washing equipment) be located? 3.4.3.  Drainage.  Although  some  pits  can  be  worked  wet  or  dry  (alluvial  pits), borrow  pits  should  always  be  worked  in  dry  conditions.  Adequate  drainage  to eliminate surface and seepage water is an essential part of borrow pit operation. While  natural  drainage  is  always  best,  if  water  cannot  be  drained  by  gravity, some type of pumping or drainage sump operation will be required. If sumps are used, locate them away from working areas and traffic. 3.4.4.  Loading  Ramps.  Loading  ramps  are  constructed  to  load  excavated material  into  trucks  and  other  hauling  units  with  earthmoving  equipment, specifically  when  sufficient  loading  equipment  (i.e.,  front-end  loader  or excavator) is not available to perform the task. They are also used to maximize loading  output  for  large  earthmoving  jobs.  When  constructing  loading  ramps,  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  they should be located as close as possible to the excavated material to limit the push distance to hauling equipment.  43 3.4.4.1.  Type of Ramps. There are several different types of loading ramps and the following should be considered when planning their construction:   What material will be loaded?   How will material be placed in the ramp?   How hauling equipment will enter and depart from the ramp? 3.4.4.1.1. Chute Ramps. Considered the simplest type of loading ramp (Figure 3.4),  when  constructed,  the  chute  should  allow  the  loading  operator  to  see hauling equipment being loaded. Figure 3.4. Simple Chute Loading Ramp.  3.4.4.1.2. Single-End Trap Ramp (Truck Back In). This style ramp is best used to  load  small  quantities  of  material  (Figure  3.5).  It  can  be  constructed  in  a minimum amount of time with very few materials. It only requires one bulldozer for  operation,  and  is  best  suited  for  bank  excavation.  A  small  area  should  be excavated  to  accommodate  the  rear  end  of  trucks.  When  large  quantities  are desired  and  sufficient  equipment  and  trucks  are  available,  the  ramp  can  be widened to allow loading of multiple trucks.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  44  Figure 3.5. Single-End Trap Ramp (Truck Back In).  3.4.4.1.3. Single-End Trap Ramp (Truck Drive Through). This ramp is similar to the back-in type, but allows for closer control of truck loading and better traffic flow and circulation (Figure 3.6). It also requires more building materials and a much stronger design and construction. Figure 3.6. Single-End Trap Ramp (Truck Drive Through).    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  3.4.4.1.4.  Single-End  Trap  Ramp  with  Grizzly.  This  ramp  is  useful  when  a grizzly (Figure 3.7) is required to remove rocks, limps, or fines from excavated material.  The  grizzly  should  be  constructed  of  heavy  wire  mesh  or  steel planking. Note: The grizzly may be adapted to or combined with any other type of loading ramp. 45 Figure 3.7. Single-End Trap Ramp with Grizzly.  3.4.4.1.5. Double-End Trap Ramp (Truck Drive Through). The double-end trap ramp  allows  material  to  be  loaded  from  two  sides  and  permits  simultaneous operation of two faces, provided two-way traffic is properly supervised (Figure 3.8). It requires more construction effort than the previous ramps and is difficult to drain. However, this type  of loading ramp  is capable of  being operated  with dozers,  graders,  or  tractor-drawn  scrapers.  Additionally,  double  loading  can  be done  by  lengthening  the  loading  ramp  similar  to  the  overhead-with  ramp  type addressed in the next paragraph. 3.4.4.1.6. Double-End Trap Ramp (Overhead with  Ramps). This type ramp is a modification  of  the  double-end  type  above.  It  allows  two  trucks  to  be  loaded simultaneously  (Figure  3.9).  Although  this  ramp  is  more  complicated  to construct than previously addressed ramps, it has the flexibility to permit single or double loading.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  46  Figure 3.8. Double-End Trap Ramp (Truck Drive Through).  Figure 3.9. Double-End Trap Ramp (Overhead with Ramps).   3.4.4.2.  Ramp  Design.  Loading  ramps  should  be  designed  to  allow  maximum visual capability by the loading operator from his or her operating position. The operator should be able to see the loading ramp and the equipment being loaded.  3.4.4.2.1. Strength. The most common error in the construction of loading ramps is  inadequate  strength.  Ramps  must  be  designed  to  support  the  weight  of  the bulldozer, plus an impact factor of 50%, and 20 tons of material. Pay particular attention to cross and sway bracing.   47 AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  3.4.4.2.2.  Walls,  Wingwalls,  and  Floors.  Ramps  must  have  walls,  wingwalls, and a floor. All walls should be well braced and high enough to prevent spillage. Cover  deck  flooring  with  material  to  prevent  damage  from  dozer  cleats.  Using 12 inches of excavated  material should be enough to prevent dozer cleats from tearing up  the flooring. When constructing traps in ramp flooring, traps  should be centered over the truck bed and smaller than the smallest equipment bed to be loaded. Larger traps waste material over the sides of the truck and require more work to keep truck roadway clear of spillage. When the back-in loading ramp is used, a stopblock should be installed for the rear wheels of trucks. 3.4.4.2.3. Columns. Design columns with braces ("dead men" or "Harvey earth” anchors)  to  prevent  columns  from  sliding  or  shifting.  Columns  beneath  the loading  ramp  should  be  spaced  wide  enough  apart  to  permit  a  grader  or  dozer blade to pass through when clearing spillage from the roadway.  3.4.4.3.  Location  and  Number  of  Loading  Ramps.  Ramps  should  be  located  as close  to  the  material  to  be  loaded  as  possible. The  number  of  ramps  should  be based on the number of haul vehicles you have and the rate material is needed.  3.5. Additional Quarry and Pit Layout Factors. 3.5.1. Supporting Roads. Access and haul roads to, from and within the site are part  of  the  supporting  road  structure.  The  shape  and  orientation  of  these  roads are  usually  a  key  factor  in  site  layout.  How  well  the  roads  are  planned  or currently  configured  can  directly  impact  quarry  or  pit  efficiency  and  safety. Below are some basic considerations for supporting roads:   Roads should be planned so heavy equipment can safely enter, exit and maneuver around the site. Additional maneuver area may be needed for oversized  equipment,  such  as  scrapers  and  large  rock  dumps  (Figure 3.10) so they can negotiate turns and other areas.   Haul  roads  to  quarries  should  be  surfaced  with  crushed  rock,  and  kept drained  to  reduce  the  amount  of  road  maintenance  required.  Roads  to and  from  pits  should  be  graded  and  compacted  to  reduce  rolling resistance for both tracked and wheeled vehicles.   AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  48    Control  dust  on  quarry  and  pit  hauls  roads  by  applying  water, geotextiles, asphalt, or road oil; do not use waste oil.   Roads should follow the shortest and easiest route available. Try to stay within the 10% uphill and downhill grade.   Design curves for safe negotiation at 20 mph.   Consider the potential advantage of establishing driving on the left-hand side of roads so the operator can see the edge of the road.   Keep haul roads and work areas in good shape. Figure 3.10. Rock Dump Equipment.  3.5.2.  Position  of  Large  Equipment.  Determining  where  to  position  large quarry and pit equipment is important when planning site layout. The location of rock  crushers,  screening  and  washing  plants,  and  other  equipment  will ultimately  have  an  effect  on  efficiency  and  safety.  If  blasting  operations  are involved, AFMAN 91-201 separation distant requirements also apply. 3.5.2.1. Rock crushers and screening plants should be located on stable ground of  sufficient  size  to  accommodate  the  plant  and  related  equipment  (conveyors and  generators),  stockpiles  of  crushed  rock,  and  loading  operations.  Consider  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  locating rock crushing, screening and  washing plants near excavation sites (but far enough away, so quarry blasting operations do not endanger plants and their operating  crews).  If  crushing  and  screening  plants  are  within  proximity  to excavations,  it  provides  two  key  benefits;  minimizes  haul  time,  and  reduces wear and overall usage on haul trucks. 49 3.5.2.2.  Equipment  maintenance  facilities  should  be  sited  in  a  suitable  location with  easy  access  near  quarry  operations.  However,  to  avoid  having  to  relocate facilities later, they should not be placed in an area of future excavation. 3.5.3.  Heavy  Equipment  Considerations.  When  developing  quarries  or  pits, engineers  should  consider  the  planned  use  and  safe  operation  of  heavy equipment  within  the  site.  Heavy  equipment  for  quarry  and  pit  operations  may include  dump  trucks,  excavators,  bulldozers,  scrapers,  loaders  and  other  large equipment (Figure 3.11). See Chapter 4 for a review of heavy equipment. Figure 3.11. Loader Stockpiling Fine Crushed Rock.  3.5.4.  Stockpiling.  When  using  heavy  equipment  to  stockpile  aggregate, exercise  extreme  care  to  avoid  rollovers.  Also,  be  aware  that  different  size aggregates in a material being stockpiled have a tendency to separate from each other...this is called segregation. If you work the material too much, segregation takes place with larger particles rolling to the bottom of the pile. To avoid this, build your stockpile in layers to make sure it maintains a uniform gradation.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  50   3.6. Quarry and Pit Development. 3.6.1. Overburden Removal. Sometimes a significant amount of waste material or  overburden  (top  soil,  humus,  and  waste  rock)  can  cover  quarries  and  pits. Consequently,  engineers  consider  overburden  thickness  and  the  effort  it  would take  to  remove  it  as  part  of  the  site  analysis.  Stripping  the  overburden  (and sometimes  vegetation)  can  be  as  large  an  operation  as  excavating  the  material itself.  If  the  overburden  thickness  exceeds  15  feet  or  is  more  than  one-third  of the  useable  material,  it  may  not  be  prudent  to  excavate  at  that  particular  site. Below are other considerations relating to overburden. 3.6.1.1. An important aspect for removing the overburden is the location of the spoil  pile.  If  the  overburden  is  not  intended  to  be  recycled,  used  for  fill,  or restored,  it  should  be  cleared  of  the  areas  planned  for  future  use.  This  reduces the need to handle the material a second time. If the overburden will be recycled, it should be located at a site that allows for the most efficient operation. Strive to separate and stockpile topsoil for future reclamation.  3.6.1.2.  Overburden  should  be  moved  back  from  the  quarry  rim  or  face  a minimum  of  50  feet  for  safety  reasons.  Ensure  overburden  location  will  not interfere with natural drainage. 3.6.1.3.  Overburden  can  be  removed  with  various  pieces  of  equipment, including bulldozers, scrapers, loaders, and trucks. 3.6.2. Excavation.  3.6.2.1.  Quarry  Excavation.  The  quarry  working  face  should  be  oriented  to minimize the undesirable influences of the rock mass being excavated. Excavate the quarry in the same direction of the strike, so the quarry face is perpendicular to  the  strike  of  the  inclined  rock  layers  (Figure  3.12).  This  orientation  is especially  important  where  rocks  are  steeply  inclined  because  it  optimizes drilling and blasting efforts by creating a vertical or near-vertical rock face after each blast.  3.6.2.1.1.  Quarries  may  be  worked  parallel  to  the  strike  direction  in  instances where the rocks are not steeply inclined, but drilling and blasting  will prove to  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  be more difficult.  As illustrated in  Figure 3.13, if the rocks dip away  from the excavation, overhang and oversized rocks are likely. If the rocks dip toward the excavation, problems with slope instability and toeing may result. 51 Figure 3.12. Quarry Face Running Perpendicular to Strike. Figure 3.13. Quarry Face Running Parallel to Strike.      AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  52  3.6.2.1.2.  The  quarry  bench  height  is  often  referred  to  as  the  height  of  the working face of the quarry where mineral deposits are mined. More specifically though,  it  is  the  vertical  distance  from  the  top  of  a  bench  to  the  floor  of  the quarry (Figure 3.14) or top of the next lower bench, if a lower bench is present. The  bench  height  of  the  quarry  must  be  determined  during  the  initial  layout phase. Several factors can influence eventually bench height, including  loading equipment, geologic conditions, and drilling equipment.   Loading Equipment. Relatively lower bench heights are preferred where front-end loaders are used to load blasted rock.   Geologic Conditions. Where layers of undesirable material occur within a  deposit,  plan  benches  so  that  the  undesirable  and  desirable  materials can be excavated separately to prevent contamination.   Drilling Equipment. If the length of drill steel is limited, the maximum bench height  will be limited to the drill steel length (in feet)  minus the amount of subdrilling (in feet).  Figure 3.14. Bench Height.   53 AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  3.6.2.2. Scraper-Operated Pit Excavation. When motorized scrapers are used to excavate  materials,  pits  are  often  divided  into  zones  and  at  right  angles  to ground  contours  for  efficiency  (Figure  3.15).  By  arranging  the  pit  into  zones, removing  overburden  and  excavation  can  be  performed  at  the  same  time.  For example, Zone 1 overburden is stripped before excavation starts, then Zone 2 is stripped while Zone 1 excavation continues, then Zone 3 and so on. Aligning the zones  at  right  angles  to  the  ground  contours  allows  scrapers  to  excavate materials downhill, thereby obtaining the maximum load and for ease in loading.  Figure 3.15. Layout of Scraper-Operated Pits. 3.6.2.3. Hillside Pit Excavation. Hillside pits are often excavated using front-end loaders  or  hydraulic  excavators  and  trucks.  Hillside  deposits  can  be  excavated from the top of the hill, at the toe or bottom of the hill, or both simultaneously. As a result, the arrangement of hillside pits can vary significantly.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  54  3.6.2.3.1. Illustrated in Figure 3.16 is one method of excavating from the top of a hill. After the area is cleared and overburden removed, deposits are excavated by  making  successive  bench  cuts  parallel  to  the  terrain’s  contour  lines.  To improve  equipment  movement,  trucks  can  use  the  first  cut  as  a  road.  Once  the top  of  the  hill  is  excavated,  crews  can  move  down  the  hillside  and  continue excavation to the final grade from road #2. Figure 3.16. Excavation from the Top of a Hill.  3.6.2.3.2. When starting excavation from the toe or bottom of the hill, a road is usually cut and leveled with a bulldozer along the base of the hill as illustrated in  Figure  3.17.  Excavation  starts  from  the  road  and  cuts  into  the  hill  until  the excavator is clear of the road. Trucks can use the first cut while the second cut is being excavated. When the excavator has advanced into the hill to a point where the maximum working face height is reached, bulldoze a second road above the cut  and  start  a  new  bench.  When  the  second  face  reaches  a  maximum  height, start a third bench, and so on.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  Figure 3.17. Excavation from the Toe of a Hill. 55  3.6.2.4. Horizontal Subsurface Pit Excavation. Subsurface pits are created when excavating  material  from  below  level  terrain.  These  pits  are  commonly excavated  using  a  circular-bench  method  (large  pits)  or  straight-bench  method (narrow pits). 3.6.2.4.1.  Large  Pits.  The  circular-bench  method  illustrated  in  Figure  3.18  is generally  used  for  large  pits  where  deposits  are  sufficiently  large.  First,  the entire top level is excavated, and then the procedure is repeated, advancing one layer at a time until reaching the desired depth. The circular shape is created as the excavator makes successive cuts within the pit. 3.6.2.4.2.  Narrow  Pits.  The  straight-bench  method  (Figure  3.19)  is  sometimes used  when  the  width  of  an  area  or  site  is  too  narrow  for  the  circular-bench method; i.e., along an old streambed. Using this  method, a hydraulic excavator or  bulldozer  digs  the  first  cut  to  the  desired  height  of  working  face.  Then, excavation  continues  at  this  level  until  the  cut  is  completed.  Reverse  the direction  of  the  excavator  and  make  a  second  cut  beside  the  first.  The  first  cut can be leveled with a bulldozer for truck travel.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  56   Figure 3.18. Subsurface Pit Using the Circular-Bench Method.  Figure 3.19. Subsurface Pit Using the Straight-Bench Method.     AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  Chapter 4 57 EXCAVATION, LOADING AND HAULING EQUIPMENT 4.1.  General  Information.  Productive  quarry  and  pit  operations  rely  on  the proper employment, servicing and maintenance of heavy equipment. Excavators (Figure  4.1),  front-end  loaders,  bulldozers,  scrapers,  dump  trucks,  and  other machines are crucial to producing needed quantities of construction materials. In order  to  be  effective  and  safe,  the  equipment  must  be  maintained  in  good working  condition  and  operated  according  to  specific  manufacturer  operating and load limits. Figure 4.1. Excavation Equipment.  4.2. Heavy Equipment. It is imperative that equipment selected for quarry and pit operations are sized to  match; large  hauling equipment  is  useless  if  loading equipment is too small for the task, and vice versa. In theory, heavy equipment used  in  quarry  and  pit  operations  are  often  grouped  into  categories;  e.g., excavation,  loading  or  hauling  equipment.  However,  in  practice,  most  of  the equipment crosses the boundaries of these categories. For example, a hydraulic excavator is used primarily for excavation, but it can also be used to load dump trucks  or  crushers;  scrapers  are  used  to  both  excavate  and  haul  material,  and front-end loaders excavate and load material. In addition, equipment accessories   AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  58  and attachments can be installed on some heavy equipment to permit additional uses;  i.e.,  grading,  spreading,  sweeping,  lifting,  or  demolition.  Bottom  line, heavy equipment can often be used for multiple purposes; however, our focus is on  equipment  used  for  digging,  loading  and  transporting  soil,  gravel  and  sand deposits  for  construction  purposes.  The  following  paragraphs  describe  heavy equipment  used  in  quarry  and  pit  operations.  It  is  not  all-inclusive  and  users should  refer  to  appropriate  T.O.s  or  manuals  for  information  on  specific equipment. 4.2.1.  Track  Loaders.  Like  the  wheeled  front-end  loader,  the  track  loader  is used  extensively  in  many  quarry  operations.  Although,  most  often  used  for surface and subsurface excavation of soft and medium soils, they are also used to load excavated material into dump trucks, loading hoppers, and moving other construction materials. (Figure 4.2). Figure 4.2. Loading Rocks with Track Loader.  4.2.2.  Excavators. Excavators  can  move  large  quantities  of  earth  or  soil. They are  sometimes  referred  to  as  large  backhoes.  These  machines  are  also  used  for lifting and loading. 4.2.3.  Bulldozers.  Bulldozers  are  powerful  wheeled  or  tracked  machines  used during  quarry  clearing  and  excavation  operations  (Figure  4.3). The  bigger  and more  powerful  heavy-duty  dozers  are  typically  used  for  deforestation,  burden removal,  and  other  large  earth-moving  operations,  while  medium-duty  dozers  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  are  sometimes  used  for  light  clearing/excavation,  stockpiling,  haul  road maintenance, or loading dump trucks via a loading ramp (paragraph 3.4.4). 59 Figure 4.3. Medium-Duty Bulldozer.  4.2.4.  Scrapers.  Scrapers  can  excavate  and  move  earth  short  distances  over relatively smooth areas. They consist of a  bowl with a gate and bladed bottom. The blade scrapes up the earth as the bowl moves forward, forcing the excavated material into the bowl. Once filled, the gate is closed and the material is carried to  the  place  of  stockpile  or  disposal.  Motorized  scrapers  (Figure  4.4)  are  the most  efficient  piece  of  equipment  to  move  large  amounts  of  material  in  the minimum amount of time. Figure 4.4. Scraper.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  60  4.2.5. Dump Trucks. Dump trucks (Figure 4.5) are the most common method to haul excavated materials. Typical design includes an open-top truck body that can be tilted to discharge its  contents through an open  tailgate. See  Chapter 5 for detailed information on articulated dump trucks or rock dumps. 4.2.6.  Front-End  Loaders.  One  of  the  most  versatile  pieces  of  excavation equipment,  front-end  loaders  can  be  equipped  to  perform  many  tasks.  The machine  has  a  hydraulically  operated  shovel  (or  bucket)  at  the  end  of  an articulated arm located at the front of the vehicle (Figure 4.5). Front-end loaders are used for both excavating and loading. Smaller models are usually equipped with a backhoe on the rear. Figure 4.5. Wheeled Front-End Loader and Dump Truck.  4.2.7. Water Trucks. In functioning quarries and pits, water trucks are essential for  controlling  dust  in  and  around  aggregate  operations.  While  nearly  every aggregate operation (drilling, blasting, excavating, hauling, crushing, screening, etc.)  produces  dust  particles,  it  is  not  feasible  to  use  water  trucks  in  every activity. However, applying water judicially in some locations can help control dust  levels  and  minimize  worker  exposure  (Figure  4.6).  Water  trucks  are  also used when compacting quarry roads and to wash dust and sand off equipment to improve operation and prolong their service life.      AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  Figure 4.6. Water Truck. 61  in  workers  being 4.3.  Basic  Hazards  and  Precautions.  Quarry  and  pit  work  crews  must  be vigilant  when  using  and  working  around  heavy  equipment.  Inattentiveness  can result trapped  and  crushed  under  heavy  equipment. Understanding  hazards  and  observing  safety  precautions  are  crucial  to preventing injuries and saving lives. The following paragraphs list a few of the basic  hazards  and  precautions  associated  with  heavy  equipment  operations documented by the U. S. Department of Labor (DOL), Occupational Safety and Health  Administration  (OSHA).  Note:  According  to  OSHA,  being  struck  by vehicles,  heavy  equipment  and  other  objects  is  the  top  cause  of  injuries  and second cause of deaths for construction workers. 4.3.1.  Hazards.  Although  not  all-inclusive,  the  following  hazards  are  some  of the most lethal associated with heavy equipment operations.  4.3.1.1.  Heavy equipment striking personnel or collision with other equipment: Heavy equipment is often operated in close proximity to other heavy equipment and  on-ground  workers  (Figure  4.7).  Sometimes,  changes  in  the  path  of  the equipment or interactions between the heavy equipment and on-ground workers are not always coordinated—creating a potential safety challenge.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  62  Figure 4.7. Close Working Proximity Creates Safety Challenge.   4.3.1.2.  Equipment  rollovers:  Equipment  rollovers  can  occur  for  a  variety  of reasons. Some examples include, operator losing position and going over a drop off,  loads  exceeding  the  capacity  of  the  equipment,  unbalanced  loads,  or  one side of the equipment encountering loose ground or a depressed area. 4.3.1.3.  Obstructed  view  in  backing:  Due  to  the  size  of  the  equipment,  heavy equipment  operators  may  have  an  obstructed  view  and  blind  spots  while backing. Dirty or broken windows may also block operators’ view of people or objects posing potential hazards. 4.3.1.4.  Caught  between  equipment  and  objects:  These  incidents  often  involve on-ground  workers  getting  pinched  between  heavy  equipment  and  other  fixed objects  or  crushed  between  the  equipment.  During  quarry  and  pit  operations, excavating,  loading  and  hauling  equipment  operate  in  close  proximity  to  each other and potential “pinch areas” can be created within the equipment’s turning radius. 4.3.1.5.  Falling  off  equipment:  Injuries  from  falls  can  often  be  attributed  to inattention,  improper  ingress  or  egress  practices,  unauthorized  riding  by workers,  sudden  turns  or  reversal  of  equipment,  and  failure  to  follow  safety protocols (e.g. jumping out of the cab instead of coming down slowly).  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  4.3.1.6. Runaway machines: Runaway machines can occur when the wheels are not  blocked  upon  parking  or  when  operators  are  not  able  to  control  the equipment.  Parking  along  a  steep  surface  without  proper  blocks  on  the downgrade side of wheels can cause such a hazard. 63 4.3.1.7. Excessive speed: Heavy equipment is not designed for excessive speeds. However, if the equipment is not loaded, some operators may have a tendency to drive  at  higher  than  normal  speeds  causing  hazards  to  on-foot  workers  and others on site. 4.3.2.  Precautions.  The  following  precautions  address  safety  measures  related to heavy equipment, including operator and on-ground worker safety.  4.3.2.1. Vehicle Equipment and Maintenance.   Vehicles that are loaded from the top (e.g., dump trucks) must have cab shields or canopies to protect the operator while loading.   Heavy  equipment  should  have  rollover  protection  and  overhead protection from falling debris hazards as necessary.   Seats for operators and  workers should have operable seat belts and be firmly secured to the vehicle.   All  required  safety  equipment  (e.g.,  backup  alarms,  horns,  rearview mirrors, fire extinguishers, etc.) should be on vehicles.   Vehicles  must  be  checked  at  the  beginning  of  each  shift  to  ensure  that parts, equipment, and accessories are in safe operating condition.   Defective parts or equipment should be repaired or replaced prior to use.   Load  capacity  or  safety  features  of  heavy  equipment  should  not  be modified without the manufacturer’s written approval.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015   CAUTION Heavy  equipment  with  missing,  poorly  functioning  or non-functioning  safety  devices  (e.g.  backing  signals,  seat belts, lights, etc.) are unsafe to operate, and should not be used until devices are installed or repaired. 4.3.2.2. Operators.  64    Operate only the equipment you are authorized and trained to operate.   Adhere  to  equipment  operating  procedures/limits  and  observe  safety precautions (no unsafe practices or horseplay).    Be aware of blind spots and swing radius of excavation equipment.   Do not move equipment without making positive visual contact with on-ground workers near the equipment.   Wear all required and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including hearing protection.   Always wear seat belts when operating heavy equipment.   Avoid  potentially  distracting  activities  (e.g.,  eating,  drinking,  adjusting non-critical vehicle controls, etc.) when operating equipment.   Correct or report hazards to your supervisor.   Do not operate vehicle in reverse with an obstructed rear view unless it has a reverse signal alarm that can be heard above ambient noise levels or you have a spotter to indicate it is safe to move.   Do  not  overload  haul  equipment  and  ensure  loads  are  balanced  and contained within the vehicle.   Remain with the vehicle when refueling and ensure ignition sources are at least 25 feet away from fueling area. AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015   65   Always  face  the  vehicle  and  maintain  three  points  of  contact  (1  foot/2 hands or 1 hand/2 feet) when getting on/off equipment.   Use seats belts properly when operating/riding vehicle.   Vehicle cabs should be free of unsecured tools or other loose items.    To prevent  slips  and  falls,  maintain  steps,  walking  platforms  and  other access areas on heavy equipment clear and as clean as possible.   When exiting equipment, be sure to set the brake, place the transmission in  appropriate  parking  position,  and  ground  all  attachments  (if applicable).  Improper  parking  can  result  in  out-of-control  and  runaway equipment. 4.3.2.3. On-Ground Workers.   Work  defensively.  Protect  yourself  at  all  times  and  observe  safety precautions (no unsafe practices or horseplay).   Workers should never place any part of their body, even for a moment, under  any  suspended  load  or  elevated  piece  of  equipment,  including  a raised loader or bucket.   Never stand within the swing radius or path of moving components.   Workers should never enter into the direct path of moving equipment or running equipment that may move unintentionally.   Approach  equipment  only  after  making  eye  contact  and  signaling  the operator; wait for the operator’s clearance to approach.   Never stand directly between  wheels or on  vehicle tracks  when talking to the operator.   Remember that equipment has blind spots and operators may not always be able to see on-ground workers, so workers should protect themselves by working defensively. For example, Figure 4.8 is a diagram from the National  Institute  for  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  (NIOSH),   AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  66  showing  the  blind  spots  associated  with  the  Cat  D7R  dozer.  In  the diagram,  the  front  of  the  dozer  is  pointed  down.  This  diagram  is  very similar to the blind spots associated with any dozer. Figure 4.8. Blind Spots with the Cat D7R Bulldozer.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015   67 Chapter 5 ROCK DUMP EQUIPMENT 5.1.  General  Information.  Articulated  dump  trucks  (ADT),  aka  rock  dumps, are  extraordinary  hauling  machines  designed  to  carry  heavy  loads  and  traverse difficult  terrain  more  efficiently than  standard dump trucks (Figure 5.1). Steep grades, uneven ground, and wet or muddy conditions presents little challenge for these huge machines. While there are many different types of ADTs, this chapter will  address  the  basic  features,  characteristics  and  operational  application  of ADTs typically used during RED HORSE quarry and pit operations. Figure 5.1. Articulated Dump Truck at Nellis AFB, Nevada (2009).  5.2.  Features  and  Characteristics.  Most  ADTs  range  in  size  from  those  with roughly 20-ton payload capacity to the larger, monster trucks capable of hauling over  40  tons  of  material.  While  ADTs  vary  in  size,  their  basic  features  and characteristics are very similar. Some of these features are addressed below. 5.2.1. Comfort. ADTs look rough and tough on the outside, but most have very comfortable  operator  stations  that  mimic  the  amenities  of  many  passenger  cars and  trucks.  Features  like  bi-level  climate  control,  noise  suppression  cabs, ergonomically  designed  air-suspension  seats,  armrests  and  head  restraints,  tilt and  telescoping  steering  wheels,  state-of-the-art  instrumentation,  and  even  cup holders, are all common features for many ADT operator stations (Figure 5.2).  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  68  Figure 5.2. Typical ADT Operator Station.   5.2.2. Visibility. Nearly all ADTs provide the operator with good visibility; the sloped  hood,  wide  front  windshield,  oversized  side  windows,  central  operator position, wide-angle mirrors, and other features contribute to better visibility. 5.2.3.  Drivability  and  Maneuverability.  Durable  and  responsive  suspension systems,  articulated  frame  design,  and  on-demand  axle  differential  locks enhance the driving ease, safety, and maneuverability of large ADTs, such as the Volvo model shown in Figure 5.3.  Figure 5.3. Suspension and Frame Design Tackles Difficult Terrain.   AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  5.2.4. Safety. Considerable safety features are incorporated into the design of all ADTs.  These  features  provide  additional  safety  for  the  operator  and  enhance situational awareness for personnel working on and around the machine. Typical safety elements may include the following: 69   Roll Over Protection System (ROPS).   Falling Object Protection System (FOPS).   Rear Window Guard/Protective Grill.   Slip-resistance Steps and Platforms.   Handrails and Handholds.   Retractable Seat Belts.   Tinted Glass and Sun Visor.   Windshield Wiper/Washers.   Wide-angled and/or Heated Rearview Mirrors.   Horn.   Hazard and/or Beacon Lights.   Work Lights.   Back up/Reverse Alarm.   Body Raised Alarm.   Dump Body Lock. 5.2.5.  Safety  Labels  and  Warning  Plates.  Most  ADTs  have  extensive  safety notices  placed  in  strategic  locations  on  the  vehicles.  Truck  operators, maintainers, and others  working  in close proximity to the  vehicle should  know and  comply  with  these  safety  notices.  Any  missing  or  unreadable  safety  labels and plates should be replaced as soon as possible. As shown below, most safety notices refer to vehicle hazards that may present significant danger to personnel:   AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  5.2.5.1. Crushing hazards.  70   Beneath raised dump body and below axle housing.   Between front and rear truck frames.   Beneath raised cab.   Caught in or under machinery. 5.2.5.2. High pressure hazards (i.e., pressurized fluids and gases).    Near truck hydraulic system and suspension lines.   Within air, oil, fuel and coolant systems. 5.2.5.3. Burn and fire hazards (i.e., hot surfaces/fluids and flammable liquids).   Engine parts and engine coolant.   Exhaust systems.   Hydraulic system fluid and components.   Fuel tank and lines. 5.2.5.4. Fall hazards.   Near steps, ladders and platforms.   Slippery surfaces,  5.2.5.5. Electric shock hazards.    Battery and electrical system components and wires. 5.2.5.6. Explosion hazards.   Battery (improper jump-start or exposure to flame).   Tires (overheated or overinflated).   Fuel and starter fluids.  71 AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  5.2.6.  Specifications.  Dump  truck  specifications  vary,  depending  on  the  size, make  and  model  of  a  particular  ADT.  For  example,  engine  power  generally range  between  265  to  over  450  horsepower  (hp),  transmissions  are  mostly automatic  with  six  forward  and  one  reverse  gear,  and  brake/retarder  systems usually  consists  of  park  and  secondary  brakes,  and  auxiliary  braking  (e.g., automatic  transmission  retarder,  engine  vale  brake,  and  exhaust  brake). However, regardless of the manufacturer, ADTs of comparable size tend to have similar  specifications.  Table  5.1  lists  selected  specifications  for  three,  similar-sized rock dumps from well-known manufacturers. Table 5.1. Truck Specifications.

Basic  Operation.  Rock  dumps  provide  a  flexible  means  to  transport  large quantities of aggregate material within quarries and pits to aggregate stockpiles and  processing  facilities;  including  crushing  and  screening  plants,  washing plants, and concrete and asphalt batch plants. Whatever the task, basic operation of  the  ADT  is  essentially  the  same.  From  initial  start-up  to  final  dumping  of material, operators should follow procedures and safety precautions outlined in specific  operator  manuals  and  other  approved  guidance.  Below  are  typical operating procedures for ADTs or rock dumps. 5.3.1.  Preoperational  Check.  Operators  should  perform  preoperational  checks according (PMCS) requirements before operating ADTs. These checks may include the following: to  Preventive  Maintenance  Checks  and  Services 5.3.1.1. Perform a walk-around inspection of the vehicle.   Verify  all  required  safety  devices  are  installed  (guards,  shields,  covers, handholds,  seat  belts,  fire  extinguishers,  etc.)  and  required  PPE  is available and used.   Look for obvious damage on the vehicle that may impair operations.   Check  the  vehicle  for  oil,  fluid,  or  water  leaks.  Wetness  around  seals, gaskets, fittings, or connections indicates leakage.   Check for missing, defective or loose parts.   Check belts for wear and tear.   Check fluid levels (oil, fuel, coolant, hydraulics).   Check air cleaner and service if necessary.   Make  sure  all  windows  are  clean  and  windshield  wipers  are  in  good condition.   Check tires for defects (cuts, gouges, etc.) and under inflation.   Check  operator  cab  for  cleanliness  and  damage.  Verify  seats  and seatbelts functions properly. AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015   WARNING Heavy  equipment  with  missing,  poorly  functioning  or non-functioning  safety  devices  (e.g.  backing  signals,  seat belts, lights, etc.) are unsafe to operate, and should not be used until devices are installed or repaired. 73  5.3.2. Start and Prepare to Operate the ADT. Once PMCS is performed and needed  repairs  completed,  the  ADT  should  be  started  according  to  specific procedures  in  the  operator  manual.  The  following  generic  procedures  are  an example of typical start-up actions for many large dump trucks. WARNING Ensure  no  one  is  working  on,  underneath  or  in  close proximity to the vehicle before staring the engine or driving the vehicle.  5.3.2.1. Climb into the ADT using available handrails, handholds, and steps. 5.3.2.2. Adjust the operator seat and rearview mirrors. 5.3.2.3. Fasten and adjust seatbelts. 5.3.2.4. Start the engine:   Parking brake set to ON.   Gearshift placed in NEUTRAL and DISENGAGE clutch.   Activate engine start controls. CAUTION Stop  the  engine  immediately  if  vibrating  or  making  an excessive noise, or if oil pressure does not register or is not maintained at required psi.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  74  5.3.2.5.  Check  Instrument  Panel  and  Gauges  (immediately  after  starting  the engine, after reaching operating temperature, and at frequent intervals).   Oil and air pressure gauges.   Battery/generator indicator (should read in the green area).   Air cleaner indicator (should not show red).   Temperature gauge.   Other gauges and warning indicators. CAUTION the  engine Stop if  any  gage  readings (temperature,  oil  pressure,  etc.)  are  out  of  range,  failure  to do so can damage engine. immediately  5.3.2.6. Check interior and exterior lights for proper operation. If necessary, use a spotter to verify exterior lights are working. 5.3.2.7. Verify horn, back up and other warning devices are working. 5.3.2.8. Perform other starting procedures according to the operator manual. 5.3.3. Operating the ADT. After starting the ADT and verifying proper systems operation, select the correct driving gear range for the road conditions. Move out slowly and always be alert for personnel working near the ADT and changes in vehicle operation and road conditions. Other driving rules may include: 5.3.3.1. Remain seated with seatbelt fasten when operating the vehicle. 5.3.3.2.  Keep  the  ADT  under  control  at  all  times.  Never  operate  beyond  the vehicle’s stated capacity and limits. 5.3.3.3. Travel with the body in the DOWN position. 5.3.3.4.  Never  raise  the  body  of  the  ADT  (even  when  empty)  if  someone  is behind the vehicle.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  5.3.3.5. Keep a safe distance away from the edge cliffs, ledges, terrain drop-offs and areas prone to slides. 75 5.3.3.6. When operating on  hills, slopes or near  water banks, or  when crossing ditches  or  other  challenging  terrain,  avoid  placing  the  vehicle  in  a  position where it may tip over. 5.3.3.7. When  possible,  work  up  and  down  slopes  versus  sideways.  Ensure  the proper gear range is selected before starting up or down grades. 5.3.3.8. Never coast the vehicle with the transmission in NEUTRAL or with the clutch depressed, it can cause overheating and damage to the transmission. CAUTION Do  not  "ride"  the  brake  when  going  down  a  steep  grade (pump  the  brakes);  this  could  cause  the  brake  linings  to overheat.  5.3.3.9. Never allow additional riders in the ADT unless they are provided a seat with seatbelt and rollover protection. 5.3.3.10. Never leave or enter the cab while ADT is being loaded (Figure 5.4). Figure 5.4. Loading ADT (John Deere Model 250D).    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  5.3.4. Park and Shutdown.  76 5.3.4.1.  Park  on  a  level  surface  whenever  possible.  If  parking  on  a  grade  is required, block the vehicle to prevent movement. 5.3.4.2. Use caution when parking. Never operate the ADT in reverse gear with an obstructed view, unless it has an audible reverse alarm, or a spotter is used.   Apply  the  service  brakes  to  stop  the  vehicle,  and  then  engage  the parking brake.   Shift the transmission to NEUTRAL and shutdown the engine according to procedures in the operator manual. 5.3.4.3.  After  vehicle  shutdown,  safely  dismount  the  ADT  using  available handrails, handholds, and steps (Figure 5.5). 5.3.4.4. Remember to report any vehicle discrepancies or required repairs noted during ADT operation to the vehicle maintenance shop for resolution.  Figure 5.5. Use Steps, Handholds and Handrails to Dismount Safely.     AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  Chapter 6 77 ROCK DRILLING EQUIPMENT 6.1. General Information. When quarry operations involve using explosives for rock  excavation,  drilling  equipment  is  often  used  to  bore  blast  holes  into  rock formations  to  place  the  explosives.  Although,  there  are  many  types  of  rock drills,  it  is  impractical  to  address  each  type  and  model  in  this  handbook.  The Atlas Copco ECM-590 rock drill (Figure 6.1) featured in this section is used by RED  HORSE  personnel  at  Nellis  AFB,  Nevada  and  has  characteristics  and operational  features  similar  to  other  rock  drills  manufactured  during  the  same period. This section provides basic information about the ECM-590 drill rig and how  it  supports  RED  HORSE  quarry  operations.  Operators  should  refer  to  the applicable operator manual or T.O. for specific information and operation. Figure 6.1. Atlas Copco ECM-590 Rock Drill. 6.2. Features and Characteristics. The ECM-590 rock drill is a track-mounted, self-contained  impact  drill,  designed  primarily  for  surface  drilling  and  quarry operations. It is rugged and compact with simple, hydraulic controls, and is ideal for  mining  in  rough  terrain  on  remote  sites  where  mobility  and  reliability  are crucial.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  78  6.2.1.  Major  Components.  The  rock  drill  has  five  major  components  as illustrated  in  Figure  6.2.  They  include  the  engine,  drill  frame,  drifter,  drill boom,  and  guide.  Attached  to  the  frame  and  guide  are  operator  control consoles—the main control console and drill control console. Figure 6.2. Major Components.  6.2.1.1.  Engine.  The  power  plant  is  a  water-cooled,  direct  injection,  turbo-charged,  diesel  fuel  engine  with  an  electric  start  and  belt-driven  alternator system.  The  engine  drives  the  air  compressor  and  hydraulic  pump.  It  has  fully integrated electronic controls and an EMERGENCY STOP switch. 6.2.1.2. Drill Frame. The drill frame supports the power pack assembly, which includes  the  compressor  and  hydraulic  pump  drive.  The  compressor  provides free air delivery (FAD) or a working pressure to the system. The hydraulic pump drive converts mechanical force and motion into hydraulic power. 6.2.1.3. Drifter. The drifter is a hydraulically operated hammer drill that “drifts” along the drill guide or track. It moves up and down the guide by a feed motor and  feed  chain.  The  drifter  has  a  hydraulically  powered  rotation  motor  that rotates  the  drill  steel  and  bit  while  it  hammers  the  bit  into  the  rock.  It  is  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  especially  suitable  for  drilling  vertical  and  angle  blast  holes  in  quarries.  The ECM-590 is equipped with either an YH70 or an YH80A drifter. Table 6.1 lists basic specifications, including blows per minute (BPM) for these model drifters. 79 Table 6.1. Basic Specifications for Drifters. Drifter Weight YH70 419 lbs. YH80A 463 lbs. Rotation Speed 0-200 RPM 0-150 RPM Impact Frequency 3000 BPM 2600 BPM Hole Size 2.5 to 4 in. 3 to 4.5 in. 6.2.1.4.  Guide.  The  drill  guide  is  attached  to  the  drill  boom.  It  houses  the hydraulically driven drifter and drill feed system. It guides drifter travel during drilling  operations.  The  guide  can  be  adjusted  for  vertical  and  dump  angle drilling. Guide controls are located on the main and drill control consoles. 6.2.1.5.  Drill  Boom.  The  variable  angle  drill  boom  positions  the  drill  over  the drill location. The boom has a maximum horizontal swing of approximately 30 degrees  right  and  35  degrees  left.  The  boom’s  maximum  vertical  movement  is 51 degrees up and 15 degrees down. Boom controls are also located on the main and drill control consoles. 6.2.2.  Controls  and  Indicators.  The  ECM-590  has  two  separate  operator control  consoles—the  main  control  console  and  the  drill  control  console.  The main  control  console  is  located  on  the  side  frame  near  the  engine  (see  Figure 6.2).  The  drill  control  console  is  mounted  on  the  drill  guide  for  optimum operator visibility during drilling operations. 6.2.2.1.  Main  Control  Console.  The  main  control  console  contains  the  power switch  and  engine  start  button.  As  shown  in  Figure  6.3,  the  console  also contains  various  engine  gauges,  switches,  and  fuses  for  the  engine,  indicators and accessories. Positioned on the  left side of  the  main control console are the controls for boom and guide positioning (Figure 6.4). Additionally, tram control levers are located under the main control console.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  80   Figure 6.3. Main Control Console. Figure 6.4. Drill Boom, Guide and Tram Controls.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  6.2.2.2. Drill Control Console. The drill control console contains the second set of  boom  and  guide  controls  (Figure  6.5);  which  directs  boom  swing,  lift  and extension, and guide extension, dump and swing. The drill control console also contains the following: 81   Feed and rotation controls and gauges.   Dust collector and Vaposol controls (dust control apparatus).   Automatic rod changer controls.   Emergency STOP button.   Blow control lever and blow air pressure gauge.   Dust collector hood.   Centralizer control (assures proper drill steel alignment).

Operational  Concepts  and  Safety.  Effective  and  safe  operation  of  the ECM-590  rock  drill  can  be  accomplished  by  following  approved  operating procedures and safety practices. Failure to do so could jeopardize the operation, your safety and the safety of others.  83 IMPORTANT NOTE This section describes common operation and safety practices for the rock drill. Users must refer to the ECM-590 operating manual or applicable T.O. for specific operating procedures.    6.3.1. Preoperational Checks. Before operating the rock drill, operators should accomplish preoperational checks (Figure 6.6) and ensure required maintenance is accomplished and all protective and safety devices are in place before starting or  moving  the  drill.  Operators  should  also  observe  lockout/tagout  procedures and other posted warnings. Figure 6.6. Preoperational Checks Enhance Operation and Safety. 6.3.1.1. Perform a complete walk-around inspection of the drill and correct any defects found during the inspection (Figure 6.7). Operators should verify:   Required maintenance (including PMCS) has been accomplished.     AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  84   Instruction and safety labels are in place and legible.   Operator consoles and gauges are not damaged.   Pumps,  motors,  valves,  hoses,  connections,  etc.  are  free  of  fluid  leaks (fuel, oil, coolant, water).    Fittings, bolts and connections are not loose or damaged.   No missing parts or parts out of adjustment.   Welds are not broken or cracked.    Required safety devices (guards, shields, etc.) are installed.    Operator’s platform is clean and free from grease, oil and other items or tools that could cause a slip or fall.   All  required  repairs  have  been  made  and  lockout/tagout  devices  or warning tags properly removed.   There is no visible damage that could impair operations. Figure 6.7. Perform Thorough Preoperational Checks.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015   WARNING Use extreme caution when handling, cleaning, or recharging batteries.  Batteries  give  off  flammable  fumes  that  can explode.  Do  not  smoke  and  always  wear  protective  glasses when checking batteries. Keep open flames away. 6.3.1.2. Verify batteries and connections are serviceable.    Battery posts and cables are free of corrosion.   Terminal clamps are tight (loose wires can shock or cause fires).   Caps are on all batteries.   Batteries are charged with correct fluid levels. WARNING Use  extreme  caution  and  wear  required  protective  clothing and equipment when checking or servicing fluids and high-pressure systems. Fluids  may be hot or under pressure and can cause severe injury or death. WARNING Never fill fuel tank while the engine is running, when near an  open  flame,  or  while  smoking.  Fuel  is  very  flammable and can explode easily. Always clean up spilled fuel.  CAUTION Do  not  fill  hydraulic tank  with  hydraulic  cylinders extended.  Excessive  hydraulic  oil  can  rupture  the  sealed hydraulic tank and cause injury or equipment damage.   85      AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  86  6.3.1.3.  Check  required  fluid  levels,  including  the  hydraulic  oil,  engine  oil, coolant, fuel, and water. Replenish or refill as necessary. 6.3.1.4. Check fuel filter/water separator for signs of water and sediment. Drain water and sediment from filters and separators as necessary. 6.3.1.5.  Verify  warning  lights,  backup  alarm  and  emergency  stop  controls  are functioning. 6.3.1.6. Ensure discrepancies are corrected before starting and operating drill. 6.3.2.  Drill  Operation.  Operators  are  the  key  to  rock  drilling  operations  and must avoid any practice or condition that compromises personnel safety or drill stability. Additionally, the drill should only be operated when all protective and safety  devices,  emergency  shut  off  equipment,  soundproofing  elements  and exhausts are in place and properly functioning.  6.3.2.1. Start-Up. The operator should check around the drill for any hazardous conditions  or  situations  before  starting  the  engine.  Also,  verify  personnel working  near  the  drill  rig  are  wearing  appropriate  PPE  (e.g.  safety  glasses, safety  shoes,  protective  gloves,  hearing  protection,  and  a  respirator  if  in  dusty conditions).   Start  the  engine  from  the  operator’s  platform  only.  Use  the  power controls  (Figure  6.8)  on  the  main  control  console  and  follow  engine start-up  procedures  on  the  panel  (Figure  6.9)  and  in  the  operator’s manual.  Be  prepared  to  push  the  EMERGENCY  STOP  button  if  a malfunction occurs.   Check  the  indicators  during  startup  procedures  IAW  the  operating instructions.  Verify  controls  and  gauges  are  in  good  working  order.  If they are broken or damaged, replace them before operating the drill.   Check the steering and lighting for proper function.    Allow  the  engine  to  idle  for  a  minimum  of  five  minutes  to  allow  for proper engine  warm up before adjusting the engine speed switch to the HIGH  position  (Figure  6.10).  Use  the  HIGH  position  when  tramming AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015   87 the machine to different locations. Once at the desired location or when ready  to  start  drilling,  switch  the  engine  speed  to  LOW.  Load  sensors will automatically regulate engine speed. Figure 6.8. Engine Start and Emergency Stop Controls. Figure 6.9. Engine Starting Procedures on Panel.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  88   Figure 6.10. Engine Speed Switch.  6.3.2.2. Moving the Drill. Operators should use extreme caution when tramming the rock drill to other locations. When moving the drill:   Make sure the drill rod is completely out of the hole before moving.   Always  verify  the  area  around  the  drill  is  clear  of  personnel  and obstacles.   Secure drill rod and tools (lower the guide if moving a long distance).   Verify the path of travel is clear.   Turn lights ON during periods of poor visibility and darkness.   Do not get on or off the drill while it is moving.   Proceed  slowly;  be  alert  and  use  extreme  caution  when  operating  on hillsides  or  near  ditches,  gullies,  holes,  or  obstructions  where  rollovers could occur.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  6.3.2.3.  Positioning  Drill  for  Operation.  The  drill  should  be  located  a  safe distance  away  from  the  edges  of  the  quarry  face,  pit  and  slopes  because  the surface  edges  could  crumble  under  the  weight  of  the  drill,  causing  personal injury or damage to the machine.  89   Ensure the drill is situated on stable ground.   Do not work near quarry faces, walls or benches that can collapse.    Adjust  the  drill  to  the  desired  drill  angle  using  the  boom  and  guide controls. 6.3.2.4. Drilling. Safety should be a vital concern when starting to drill or setting the  drill  in  motion.  Operators  should  avoid  any  situation  or  operational  mode that might jeopardize their safety or others.   Ensure protective and safety devices are in place prior to drilling.   Check that the dust hood seal is correctly sealing around the drill steel. Note: Change dust hood seal if damaged.   Check the pickup hood and suction hoses for any blockages.   Check the suction hose for sharp bends or crushed areas that can prevent it from supporting itself or blocking airflow.   Turn dust collectors on and close oscillation controls.   Follow  drill  procedures  according  to  the  operator  manual.  During  cold weather, engage hydraulic controls slowly to avoid shock loading.   While the drill is operating, personnel should not place any part of their bodies  or  clothing  on  or  near  any  rotating  machinery,  gears,  cables,  or chains.   Make  periodic  checks  of  the  drill  during  operation.  Listen  for  any unusual noises.   Monitor  feed  chain  vibration.  Excessive  chain  vibration  can  cause  the chain to come loose from the sprocket and damage the equipment.   AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  90  6.3.2.5.  Parking  and  Normal  Shutdown.  Whenever  possible,  park  the  drill  on solid,  level  ground  and  away  from  the  quarry  face  or  other  high  wall  before shutting  the  drill  down  for  the  day.  Also,  avoid  parking  the  drill  under  an overhang or other location vulnerable to cave-ins.    Relieve all pressures  in  the  systems and place all controls  in  neutral or park position before leaving the drill.   Position the engine speed control to LOW and allow the engine to idle for five minutes to cool down.    Turn the engine key switch to OFF, remove the key and secure the drill from inadvertent movement. 6.3.2.6. Emergency Shutdown. To perform an immediate shutdown of the drill in an emergency, push the EMERGENCY STOP button located either at the main control console or the drill control console (see Figure 6.5 and Figure 6.8). 6.3.2.7.  Transporting  Drill  on  a  Truck  or  Trailer.  Before  transporting  the  drill on a truck or trailer (Figure 6.11), make sure the  machine has been shut down and configured according to the operator manual. Basic precautions include: Figure 6.11. ECM-590 Prepared for Transport.   AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015    Secure all drill rods and tools. 91   Attach chains and binders to  secure the  machine to the  truck or trailer. Refer to the operator manual to locate proper lifting points.   Ensure there is sufficient clearance  when crossing underpasses, bridges and tunnels, or under overhead lines (consider the drill’s height,  width, weight and length). 6.3.2.8.  Maintaining  the  Drill.  The  drill  should  be  kept  in  good  working condition  according  to  procedures  in  the  operator  manual.  Note:  Unauthorized modifications  to  the  machine  may  impair  function  and/or  safety  and  could impact machine service life. Drill operators should:   Ensure required maintenance (including prestart checks) is performed.   Never operate the machine with loose, worn, or broken parts.   Avoid operational modes or conditions that could damage the machine.   Make  sure  all  safety  devices,  including  shields  are  installed  and functioning properly.   Look out for leaking or broken hydraulic lines and air hoses.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  92   Chapter 7 BLAST DESIGN 7.1.  General  Information.  Whenever  RED  HORSE  teams  use  explosives during  quarry  mining  operations,  blast  design  (including  blast  calculations  and blasthole  drilling)  is  carefully  planned  so  the  desired  amount  of  material  is produced with each calculated blast. While this section does not address blasting procedures  or  requirements,  it  does  provide  an  overview  of  important  factors related to blast design.  IMPORTANT NOTE This  section  provides  general  information  ONLY.  It  does  not replace  any  policy  documents,  T.O.s  and  manuals,  or  any applicable  mandatory  procedures  or  instructions.  Users  must review  applicable  technical,  safety,  and  policy  references  before performing any drilling, blasting, or related explosives tasks.     7.2.  Design  Considerations.  The  cut  refers  to  the  width  and  depth  of  material separated  from  the  quarry  bench  in  any  single  blast.  When  designing  cuts  for aggregate  production,  the  goal  of  the  head  blaster  and  driller  should  be  to provide  the  optimum  amount  of  material  to  support  rock  crushing  or  other aggregate  processing  operations  between  blasts.  Although  imprecise,  the  cut design  should  get  as  close  to  your  objective  as  possible.  If  adjustments  are necessary, make one change at a time—so you know how the change influences the results. Head blasters must work closely with drillers to follow the cut design because it delineates both explosives and drilling requirements for blast holes. 7.2.1. The volume of the cut should be equal to the  bench height x the length x the  width (Figure 7.1);  which equates to the  material expected to be dislodged by the blast. These factors are defined below: 7.2.1.1.  Bench  height.  The  bench  height  is  the  distance  between  the  top  of  the bench  to  the  quarry  floor  (or  lower  level).  Sometimes  the  type  of  drilling,  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  excavation  or  loading  equipment  used,  existing  ground  elevation,  or  other physical or geologic conditions determines the height of the bench. 93 7.2.1.2.  Cut  length.  The  cut  length  is  the  total  length  (including  spacing)  of  a row of blast holes measured perpendicular to the burden and parallel to the free face. 7.2.1.3.  Burden  distance  (width).  One  of  the  most  important  dimensions  in  cut design,  the  burden  distance  is  normally  the  distance  from  the  blast  hole  to  the free face of the bench or excavation. However, underlying rock conditions could affect the burden distance and direction. Figure 7.1. Cut Volume Equals Bench Height, Width and Length.  7.3.  Blasthole  Drilling.  Rock  drills  are  used  extensively  during  quarry  mining operations to bore blast holes. Drills equipped with sectional drill steels (each 10 or  12  feet  long),  are  used  to  reach  the  hole  depth  required  by  the  cut  design. Factors  that  impact  blast  hole  drilling  include;  the  planned  use  of  explosives, loading and hauling equipment, and geologic features (cracks, joints, etc.) of the rock  formation.  Other  fundamental  aspects  of  drilling  blast  holes  include  hole configuration, depth, angle, spacing, and patterns.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  94  7.3.1. Configuration. By design, blast holes pressurize instantly when confined explosives  detonate.  The  high,  gas  energy  output  of  these  explosions  produce significant  rock-breaking  power.  Although  very  simplistic,  blast  holes  can  be drilled  and  configured  to  produce  specific  results.  The  angle  and  depth  of  the hole, type of stemming or the type, size and placement of explosives within the hole  can  all  influence  final  blast  results.  Figure  7.2  illustrates  the  basic configuration of a vertical blast hole drilled adjacent to a quarry face. It consists of the powder column (PC), stemming (T), and subdrill (J). The vertical hole is the  most  economical  and  easiest  to  load.  In  the  illustration,  the  existing  quarry face can be removed and a new face is easily developed. Figure 7.2. Vertical Blast Hole (Typical Configuration).  7.3.1.1. Stemming. Material used to dam or plug the collar regions of blast holes to  restrain  or  confine  the  energy  of  the  explosion  and  limit  the  ejection  of  fly rock. It is also used to separate the explosives in deck loading operations and to fill  spaces  caused  by  voids  or  cracks  (Figure  7.3).  Stemming  (T)  should  be made  of  noncombustible,  inert  materials  such  as,  sized  crushed  stone,  drill cuttings, sand, or clay material.   AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  Figure 7.3. Stemming Fills Space Caused by Voids or Cracks. 95  7.3.1.2.  Powder  Column.  The  powder  column  (PC)  is  the  portion  of  the  blast hole minus the section used for stemming (T) material.  7.3.1.3. Subdrill. A portion of the blast hole (J) that is drilled below the planned grade  or  quarry  floor.  Subdrilling  is  used  to  soften  the  quarry  floor  and  help keep  it  smooth  and  level.  Note:  To  improve  fragmentation,  blasthole  primer should not be placed in the subdrill. 7.3.2. Depth. The blasthole depth for vertical holes is usually equal to the height of  the  quarry  face  plus  the  subdrilling.  In  the  case  of  a  multiple-bench  quarry, the  hole  depth  is  typically  equal  to  the  height  of  the  bench  height  plus  the subdrilling. Drill holes are normally subdrilled 2 to 3 feet below the quarry floor to ensure complete rock fragmentation between holes during blasting and to help keep the quarry floor level. Sometimes, backfilling will be necessary to create a suitable working floor after blasting.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  96  7.3.3. Angle. Depending on the purpose of the cut, the angle of blast holes may be vertical, horizontal, or inclined. For example, Figure 7.4 illustrates the use of both  horizontal  and  vertical  blast  holes  to  establish  a  vertical  face  in  a  hillside quarry  (toe  cut).  In  other  examples,  inclined  and  vertical  holes  are  used  to establish a vertical face in a hillside quarry (Figure 7.5) and to cut a ramp for a subsurface quarry (Figure 7.6). WARNING Due to the increased danger of blowing fly rock and debris from  the  blast  hole,  additional  care  should  be  taken  to ensure proper stemming of angled or horizontal blast holes.  Figure 7.4. Toe Cut Using Horizontal and Vertical Blast Holes. Figure 7.5. Establish Quarry Face with Inclined and Vertical Holes.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  Figure 7.6. Excavating Ramp into a Subsurface Quarry. 97  7.3.4.  Spacing.  Spacing  is  the  distance  between  blast  holes  in  the  same  row; measured  parallel  to  the  free  face  (Figure  7.7).  It  is  important  to  securing uniform rock breakage of suitable size. The spacing distance is usually not more than 1.5 to 2 times the burden distance and is not recommended to be less than the  burden  distance.  Spacing  distance  less  than  burden  distance  can  lead  to fracture between holes causing propagation or blast hole cutoff and a misfire of individual holes. If spacing is too great, large unbroken boulders and a potential toe between holes could occur. Figure 7.7. Hole Spacing.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  98  7.3.5.  Drilling  Patterns.  The  drilling  pattern  is  usually  selected  after determining  the  desired  burden  and  hole  spacing.  The  patterns  used  in  quarry operations  are  single  row  and  multiple-row.  The  drilling  patterns  are  based  on the blasting plan and are relevant to both vertical and inclined blast holes.  7.3.5.1. Single Row. The holes in the single-row pattern can be rigged for either simultaneous  or  delayed  initiation.  For  simultaneous  initiation,  the  spacing should  be  twice  the  burden  for  best  fragmentation.  If  there  is  a  front  and  side face, the hole nearest the open side should be drilled one burden distance from each face (Figure 7.8). For delayed initiation, more holes per width of the face may be required but fewer explosives may be needed and rock can be thrown in a desired direction. Figure 7.8. Single-Row Drilling Pattern.  7.3.5.2.  Multiple-Row.  Multiple-row  patterns  are  square,  rectangular,  and staggered. These patterns usually require delay caps or other delay devices. The square and rectangular patterns are the most commonly used.   Square.  In  the  square  pattern  (Figure  7.9),  the  burden/spacing  ratio  is 1:1. The holes in each row are aligned behind the holes in front of it.   Rectangular. In the rectangular pattern (Figure 7.10), the burden is less than the spacing. The holes in each row are aligned behind the holes in front of it forming a rectangular.   Staggered.  In  the  staggered  pattern  (Figure  7.11),  the  burden  and spacing may be equal. However, burden is more often the driving factor AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015   99 rather than the spacing. The holes in alternate rows are in the middle of the  spacing  of  the  row  in  front  of  it.  The  staggered  pattern  usually requires extra holes to achieve a uniform bank on each end of the blast. Figure 7.9. Square Drilling Pattern. Figure 7.10. Rectangular Drilling Pattern.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  100  Figure 7.11. Staggered Drilling Pattern.  7.4. Drilling Log. Prior to drilling, a drilling log should be prepared following a visual  inspection  of  the  quarry’s  face  and  bench.  The  drilling  log  provides  the drilling crew instructions and warnings about each hole (Table 7.1). All visible seams  and  cracks  noted  during  the  inspection  should  be  incorporated  into  drill plans  and  listed  in  the  drilling  log.  The  log  should  include  the  following information:    Drilling pattern.   Hole number, size and depth.   Location  of  actual  or  potential  cracks,  seams  or  any  type  of  hole disruption.   Observations and variations from proposed plans. 7.4.1. The drilling crew drills the pattern according to the log and records their observations  and  variations  from  the  expected  results.  If  joints  or  cracks  are present, it could affect the drilling pattern. Heavily jointed rock formations often produce  overbreak  along  joint  planes  during  blasting.  Bore  holes  should  be drilled the “burden” distance from the crack.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  Table 7.1. Drilling Log Example.

When the drilling log is completed, plans should be made for loading the boreholes based on the results of the drilling and the observations of the drilling crew.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  102  Chapter 8  ROTARY IMPACT CRUSHER AND SCREENING PLANT 8.1. General Information. As their name suggests, rock crushers and screening plants break and separate (screen) rock material into the final desired aggregate product. There are many types and models of rock crushers and screening plants in  existence.  They  include  jaw,  cone,  and  impact  rotary  type  plants—both mobile  and  fixed  site  units.  Some  of  the  military  plants  have  been  around  for years  and  may  have  undergone  several  modifications.  Air  Force  CE  has  also begun  purchasing  more  efficient,  and  sometimes  smaller,  mobile  units  for contingencies and future operations (Figure 8.1). Therefore, it is likely you may encounter different types during your tour of duty. While this chapter illustrates only the rotary type crusher and screening plant, certain systems and operational concepts addressed here are similar to other types and models and are therefore beneficial  to  your  understanding  of  how  these  systems  work.  However,  users must  refer  to  the  applicable  T.O.  or  operator  manual  for  detailed  technical  and safety information for their specific model. Figure 8.1. Loading New Crusher for Airlift to AOR. 8.2. Description. The Rotary Impact Crusher and Screening Plant delivers rock crushing  and  screening  capabilities.  The  plant  shown  in  Figure  8.2  has  an overall  height  of  13  feet  6  inches  and  a  weight  of  106,000  lbs.  A  272   AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  horsepower diesel engine and a 75 kW generator power this older model plant. However,  newer  models  come  with  a  325-HP  diesel  engine  and  100  kW generators.  The  plant  can  process  a  high  volume  of  virtually  any  aggregate  or common recyclable feed material. 103 Figure 8.2. Rotary Impact Crusher and Screening Plant.  8.3.  Components.  The  components  of  the  crushing  and  screening  plant  are critical  to  the  production  of  aggregate  materials  for  concrete  and  asphalt production. The major parts of this plant consist of the items addressed below: 8.3.1.  Hopper  and  Feeder  Assembly.  The  hopper  and  feeder  assembly  consists primarily of the hopper and a vibrating grizzly feeder (Figure 8.3). The hopper holds  the  material  while  the  vibrating  grizzly  feeder  separates  and  sends  any material  larger  than  one  and  one-half  inches  to  the  impactor  for  crushing. Materials smaller than 1-1/2 inches is permitted to pass through the grizzly bars to the conveyor belts below. WARNING Never allow workers to position themselves directly over the intake of an impactor while it is actively crushing rock.     AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  104   WARNING Due to the risk of aggregate falling off a conveyor, Type II impact resistant hard hats must be worn at all times while the crusher is in operation.  8.3.2. Impactor. The Impactor is a combination Primary and Secondary crusher that is  suitable for both recycling and aggregate applications (Figure 8.3). It is capable  of  processing  a  variety  of  sized  materials  by  using  the  wide  range  of settings  and  adjustments  of  the  primary  and  secondary  curtains.  The  impactor has three main parts: Housing, Rotor and Curtains. Figure 8.3. Hopper and Feeder Assembly. WARNING  The impact crusher cannot stop immediately due to forces required to crush concrete and stone, it could take 15 minutes for the impactor’s rotor to come to a stop.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  8.3.2.1.  The  Housing  holds  the  material  while  it  is  being  crushed.  It  can  be opened using hydraulics or an auxiliary engine when performing inspections or maintenance  (Figure  8.4).  Wear  plates  line  the  inside  of  the  housing  and  are periodically  rotated  and  replaced  according  to  wear.  To  meet  environmental standards, the housing also has built-in spray heads to control dust. 105 Figure 8.4. Using Hydraulics to Raise Impactor Housing.  8.3.2.2. The rotor, which is driven by belts from the engine, spins approximately 60 miles per hour. It holds three blow bars that break up the material. In essence, the  blow  bars  are  hammers  that  provide  blunt-force  impact  to  the  stone, concrete,  or  other  materials  being  processed.  See  Figure  8.5  for  an  illustration of this process. 8.3.2.3.  The  primary  curtain;  which  is  “gravity  hung,”  also  help  to  break  the material  into  what  is  called  “final  product  plus  4  inches.”  This  means  that material  passing  the  primary  curtain  is  not  the  finished  product  size  and  will generally  be  sized  to  “4-inches  plus.”  The  secondary  curtain,  which  is “hydraulically adjusted,” breaks the material into its final product size.   AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  106  8.3.3.  Engine  and  Generator.  The  engine  is  diesel-powered.  It  drives  the  rotor and  runs  the  generator  assembly.  The  generator  runs  off  the  diesel  engine  and provides 480 volts AC power to the main control panel (Figure 8.6). Figure 8.5. Illustration of Impactor Crushing Process. Figure 8.6. Engine and Generator.    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  8.3.4. Main Control Panel. The main control panel (Figure 8.7) has the start and stop  buttons  to  operate  the  unit,  however,  the  impactor,  engine,  and  generator operate independently from the electrically controlled motors. In addition to all the  start  and  stop  buttons,  the  main  control  panel  also  has  three  additional starters  and  outlets  for  auxiliary  equipment  such  as  additional  radial  stacking conveyors.  Auxiliary  equipment  is  plugged  into  the  designated  outlet  on  the control cabinet as shown in Figure 8.8. 107 8.3.5.  Remote  Operator  Panel.  The  remote  operator’s  panel  is  mounted  on  the operator’s platform near the feed hopper (Figure 8.9). The operator can control all electric motors from this panel. Motors are started from the furthest material handling point in sequence back to the feed hopper. As a safety precaution, if a motor stops during production, all the  motors  from that  motor back to the feed hopper  also  stop.  This  helps  to  clear  material  from  the  crusher  and  limit  the amount  of  material  that  piles  up  at  the  stopping  point.  The  emergency  stop button shown in Figure 8.10 stops the operation of all electric motors. Figure 8.7. Main Control Panel.   AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  108  Figure 8.8.

Conveyors.  Electric-powered  conveyors  belts  are  a  prominent  feature  of the  crusher  and  screening  plant.  Several  conveyors  are  shown  in  Figure  8.11. They are used to  move aggregate  materials throughout the plant and consist of the  grizzly  cross  conveyor,  discharge  conveyor,  lower  cross  conveyor,  upper cross  conveyor,  fines  conveyor  and  the  return  conveyor.  The  grizzly  cross conveyor collects material that is small enough to pass through the grizzly bars and discharges it from the crusher system or  moves it to the primary discharge conveyor. The primary discharge conveyor moves material from the impactor to the screens for separation and discharge into the appropriate aggregate stockpile using the upper, lower, and fines conveyor. The return conveyor is used to return oversized material to the impactor for re-crushing. 8.3.7. Screens. The screens are designed to separate crushed aggregate material into two, final product-sized materials. There are two screens, a large screen on the top deck and a smaller one on the lower deck (Figure 8.12). Material that is too  large  to  pass  through  the  large  screen  can  be  returned  to  the  impactor  or discharged as a third product. A fourth product can also be obtained by using the material that passed through the grizzly bars prior to the crushing process.   AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  Figure 8.11. Conveyors. Figure 8.12. Screens.  110    AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  8.3.8.  Magnetic  Separator.  The  magnetic  separator  is  designed  for  recycling crushed  concrete  with  rebar  reinforcement.  The  separator  is  an  electro-magnet that energizes the lower portion of the belt (Figure 8.13). When the metal from the crushed material is picked up it is carried along the lower portion of the belt then  released  and  falls  out  of  the  crusher  system.  The  metal  is  removed  to prevent screen blockage and contamination of the product. 111 8.3.9. Radial Stackers. As its name indicates, the stacker’s function is to stack or stockpile  bulk  material  that  has  been  processed  through  the  crushing  and screening  plant  (Figure  8.13).  Stackers  are  equipped  with  a  heavy-duty  frame construction, supports, and axles and can be  manually raised and lowered. The stacker’s electric motor drive is pre-wired with 100 to 150 feet of power cable as shown  in  Figure  8.14.  The  cable  is  usually  plugged  into  one  of  the  auxiliary outlets on the main control panel. Figure 8.13. Magnetic Separator and Radial Stackers.   AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  112  Figure 8.14. Radial Stacker Power Cable.   8.4. Operational Safety. Every major part of the crusher and screening plant is involved in aggregate production.  Anyone near the  machine should observe  all safety  precautions  when  the  unit  is  operating.  The  operator  should  begin  each shift  with  a  detailed  safety  briefing  and  the  work  crew  should  have/wear appropriate  protective  equipment  (see  paragraph  8.4.3).  The  crushing  and screening  process  begins  when  stone  is  initially  dropped  into  the  grizzly  feed hopper, and continues through the feed box assembly and into the impactor for crushing.  From  the  impactor,  the  material  is  screened  and  discharged  onto  the appropriate stockpile via conveyors. Rocks that are too large to pass through the screen can be discharged or sent back to the impactor for crushing via the return conveyor.  Although  this  process  may  seem  simple,  it  can  be  very  hazardous, especially  if  individuals  are  not  attentive.  Take  seriously  any  DANGER, WARNING,  or  CAUTION  sign,  they  are  critical  to  preventing  injury.  In addition, all protection guards and warning signs installed at the factory should not be changed, modified, or removed.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015   WARNING 113 NEVER  attempt  to  remove  jammed  material  while  machinery is  in  operation.  Shut  down,  isolate,  and  block  all  hazardous energy sources before performing machine maintenance.     8.4.1.  Moving  Parts.  The  operator  is  responsible  for  everyone  working  on  or near the plant. He or she should look around before starting any equipment and ensure  they  know  the  location  of  all  the  workers.  He  or  she  must  also  be  fully aware  of  the  related  dangers  and  the  safety  precautions  that  must  be  followed. Report  any  defective  or  unsafe  situation  to  a  supervisor.  Obviously,  since  this equipment  is  made  to  crush  concrete  and  large  stones,  careless  operation  or failure to follow hazard warnings could kill or severely injure personnel. In fact, any moving part can be dangerous, so never attempt to clean, lubricate, or adjust any  part  of  the  machine  while  it  is  in  motion.  The  impactor  is  especially dangerous  because  it  takes  a  while  for  it  to  stop  when  the  drive  is  disengaged. Actually, it could take up to 15 minutes for the rotor to stop turning. Always use extreme caution around this component and follow all safety precautions. 8.4.2. High Voltage. The machine is very powerful with extremely high voltage currents,  and  unauthorized  persons  should  stay  clear  of  high  voltage  terminals, including those in the main control panel box. These general safety precautions cover  the  spectrum  of  plant  operations,  and  it  should  be  abundantly  clear  that you  must observe these and all safety precautions—for your protection and the protection of others. 8.4.3.  Protective  Equipment.  Just  as  important  as  adhering  to  general  safety precautions,  personnel  must  also  wear  personal  protective  equipment  or  PPE, like  that  listed  below  when  operating  the  equipment.  Depending  on  the environment, wear of additional equipment may also be necessary.    Hardhat.   Safety glasses.   Ear protection.  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  114     Safety boots.   Dust mask.   Gloves.   Reflective Vest/Accessories. 8.5.  Maintenance  Activities.  Good  preoperational  checks  and  a  consistent daily,  weekly,  and  general  maintenance  program  are  necessary  to  keep  the machine’s  equipment  in  peak  operational  condition.  Operators  must  also maintain  a  high  level  of  safety  awareness  when  performing  inspection  and maintenance  actions.  Below  is  a  brief  summary  of  operator  maintenance activities. WARNING Do not clean, lubricate, or adjust any part of the  machine while it is in motion. Personal injury or death could result from contact with moving parts.  8.5.1. Preoperational Check. These checks are essential to the overall crushing and  screening  operation  and  should  be  accomplished  before  starting  the  unit. First,  ensure  the  plant  is  as  level  as  possible  because  aggregate  material  will flow to the low side of an unleveled plant. This condition will result in uneven wear to the equipment, as well as a reduction in plant capacity. When necessary, the  plant  can  be  leveled  using  the  gas-powered  standard  lift/leveling  system. Other  preoperational  checks  include  verifying  correct  fluid  levels  for  oil,  fuel, and coolant; ensuring proper clutch engagement; checking the condition of con-veyor  belts  and  bearings,  and  the  inside  of  the  impactor  for  wear  and  damage. Required adjustments, repairs, and part replacement must be made prior to start-ing up the plant. 8.5.2. Daily Maintenance. Similar to preoperational checks, daily maintenance actions  require  that  items  like  the  engine  oil,  coolant,  and  conveyer  belts  be checked for wear and tear. In addition, operators should perform a walk-around  AFH10-222 Volume 17, 28 May 2015  visual  inspection  of  all  the  sections  of  the  unit.  This  is  usually  a  good  way  to spot fluid or lubricant leaks and examine any bolted connections for looseness. In  addition,  dirt  buildup  should  be  removed  when  discovered.  If  the  diesel engine  air  filter  is  dirty,  compressed  air  can  be  used  to  clean  it.  In  addition  to basic  daily  maintenance,  the  screening  plant  also  requires  belt  tensions  be checked and corrected, protective guards be in place, and excess material build-up be removed from the feed box. 115 8.5.3.  Weekly  Maintenance.  Weekly  maintenance  should  include  greasing  the conveyor pulleys, bearings, and all the seals. In addition, the V-belts should be inspected  for  proper  adjustment.  Compressed  air  can  be  used  to  blow accumulated  dust  and  foreign  materials  out  of  the  diesel  engine  radiator  to prevent the restriction of airflow. This helps prevent the engine’s cooling system from  overheating  or  automatically  shutting  down  the  engine.  The  level  of  the crusher and screening plant should be checked weekly and adjusted, as required. Weekly maintenance also requires inspection of the feed box liner for excessive wear.
