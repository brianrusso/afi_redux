Overview.  This instruction sets forth two methods for hiring civilian attorneys. Chapter 1 presents overarching principles and describes the responsibilities and functions of the qualifying authority.    Chapter  2  details  the  fully  competitive  hiring  process,  similar  to  that  used  in  the competitive  service.    Chapter  3  explains  the  accelerated  hiring  process,  consistent  with  the excepted  service  nature  of  attorney  positions.    This  process  allows  for  an  expedited  fill  of  a vacancy,  without  competition,  when  a  qualified,  interested,  and  available  candidate  exists.  Chapter 4 details the process of approval by the qualifying authority.  Chapter 5 describes final processing by the servicing civilian personnel office (CPO). 1.2.  Principles.  All  attorney  personnel  actions  shall  be  taken  on  the  basis  of  merit  and  in conformity with applicable laws and regulations.  Attorney positions classified below the Senior Executive  Service  (SES)  level  are  part  of  the  “excepted  service”  and  are  exempt  from competitive  ranking  and  referral  procedures.    The  following  principles  and  practices  are applicable to all attorney personnel actions. 1.2.1.  Evaluation  of  applicants  for  civilian  attorney  positions  shall  be  made  based  on  the skills,  background,  knowledge,  relevant  experience,  and  academic  achievement  of  the applicants, with the sole object being to obtain the highest caliber, most qualified candidates. 1.2.2.  Recruitment  of  civilian  attorneys  to  entry-level  positions  shall  be  undertaken  on  the widest  practicable  basis,  in  conformity  with  the  policy  on  diversity  in  AFPD  36-70, Diversity. 1.2.3.  All actions shall be taken without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability,  genetic information,  prior protected activity or disclosure, or any other non-merit factors prohibited by statute, regulation, or Executive Order, and in conformity with the policy in AFPD 36-27, Equal Opportunity (EO). 1.2.4.  Veterans’  preference  provisions  will  be  followed  to  the  extent  administratively feasible  in  accepting  and  rating  applications  prior  to  submitting  them  to  the  qualifying authority. 1.2.5.  Military  spouses’  preference  should  be  equitably  applied  for  spouses  of  active  duty Service members when they apply for GS-15 and below positions, as outlined in Subchapter 315, Employment of Spouses of Active Duty Military, of DOD Instruction 1400.25, Civilian Personnel  Manual.    Military  spouses’  preference  shall  not  contravene  existing  statutes  or regulations on veterans’ preference or nepotism. 1.2.6.  Attorney appointments are subject to service of a one-year probationary period.  The vacancy  announcement  will  mention  the  probationary  period,  and  candidates  should  be advised  of  it  during  interviews.    An  attorney  who  has  successfully  completed  an  initial probationary  period  is  not  subject  to  another  probationary  period  if  later  reappointed  to  a different attorney position, unless the attorney is assuming a supervisory position for the first time. AFI51-107  24 October 2011   5  1.2.7.  Air Force civilian attorneys shall not be penalized in decisions related to performance evaluations  or  awards  for  issuing  timely,  well-reasoned  legal  advice  that  correctly  states applicable laws and regulations. 1.2.8.  Although  time-in-grade  restrictions  do  not  apply  to  attorney  promotions,  rapid promotions  should  be  avoided.    Normally,  attorneys  should  serve  one  year  in  grade  before being promoted to the next higher grade.  However, if employees with less time-in-grade are rated by the local civilian attorney committee among the best qualified candidates, they may be  eligible  for  appointment  to  the  higher  grade.    This  authority  should  be  used  sparingly, though. 1.2.9.  As  a  condition  of  employment,  any  Air  Force  civilian  attorney  covered  by  this instruction  must  be  an  active  (or  equivalent)  member,  in  good  standing,  of  the  bar  of  the highest court of a state, U.S. commonwealth, U.S. territory, or the District of Columbia.  The attorney  must  maintain  such  bar  membership  in  at  least  one  jurisdiction  during  the  entire course of employment with the Air Force. 1.2.9.1.  “Active  (or  equivalent)”  membership  means  the  attorney  holds  a  license  that authorizes  the  attorney  to  engage  in  the  immediate,  active  practice  of  law  in  the jurisdiction of the licensing authority.  State licensure types such as “inactive,” “retired,” “non-practicing,” “emeritus,” or “ineligible,” which do not permit the immediate, active practice  of  law,  will  not  satisfy  this  requirement,  even  if  the  member  is  in  “good standing.”    Members  may  hold  an  active  (or  equivalent)  license  and  claim  exemptions from  dues  or  continuing  legal  education  (CLE)  (e.g.,  for  federal  practice  or  out-of-state attorneys); but an exemption that precludes the immediate, active practice of law will not satisfy  the  licensing  requirement  for  Air  Force  employment.    For  example,  a  “non-practicing CLE exemption” that effectively requires an attorney to affirm he or she is not engaged in the practice of law will not satisfy the active (or equivalent) requirement.  A license  that  precludes  representing  individuals  or  institutions  in  a  private  capacity,  but otherwise  permits  the  immediate,  active  practice  of  law  in  the  jurisdiction,  meets  the requirement for Air Force practice. 1.2.9.1.1.  In  the  event  it  is  unclear  whether  a  jurisdiction’s  licensing  status  or exemption  meets  the  above  criteria,  a  civilian  attorney  may  request  an  authoritative determination by the General Counsel (GC) or The Judge Advocate General (TJAG), as applicable. 1.2.9.1.2.  The  attorney  submits  the  request  through  supervisory  channels  to  the Attorney  Licensing Committee, which includes  AF/JAX (Chair), AF/JAZ, AF/JAA-PR,  and  SAF/GCA.    The  committee  will  review  the  request  and  forward  a recommendation to the GC or TJAG, as applicable, for final determination. 1.2.9.2.  By establishing the requirement to maintain active (or equivalent) membership, the Air Force adopts a standard in line with what is expected of attorneys in the private practice  of  law.    Moreover,  these  licensing  requirements  are  intended  to  promote  the respect  with  which  civilian  lawyers  are  held  in  the  Air  Force,  reinforce  the  public’s confidence in their competence and credentials, and assist in the detection and prevention of the unauthorized practice of law.   6  AFI51-107  24 October 2011 1.2.9.3.  An attorney’s suspension or disbarment by his or her licensing authority may be grounds for termination under AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse Actions. 1.2.9.4.  If an attorney’s suspension or disbarment by a licensing authority does not result in  termination,  the  attorney  shall  be  reassigned  to  a  non-attorney  position  (except  when the  attorney  remains  qualified  to  practice  law  by  virtue  of  an  active  license  in  another jurisdiction).    The  conditions  of  suspension  or  disbarment  imposed  by  the  licensing jurisdiction  might  preclude  assignment  to  a  law-related  position  (i.e.,  law  clerk  or paralegal).  Even if permitted, supervisors must consider whether the basis for disbarment or suspension would make assignment to a law-related position ill-advised. 1.2.9.5.  A  suspended  or  disbarred  civilian  attorney  who  is  reassigned  to  a  non-attorney position  may  not  reoccupy  a  civilian  attorney  position  unless  qualified  again.    In  that event,  the  application  to  the  qualifying  authority  shall  be  accompanied  by  a recommendation from the GC or TJAG, as applicable. 1.2.9.6.  TJAG or designee may suspend a civilian attorney’s authority to practice law in a position in the Air Force Judge Advocate General’s Corps for a substantiated violation of  the  Air  Force  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct.    The  proposed  suspension  must  be presented to the attorney in writing, specify its length (not to exceed one year), and afford the attorney a reasonable opportunity to respond.  TJAG will then make a decision after considering the attorney’s response, if any.  A suspension under this paragraph may occur irrespective of any sanction by the attorney’s licensing authority.  A suspension from the Air Force legal practice may form the basis for termination, suspension, reassignment, or other appropriate civilian personnel action under AFI 36-704. 1.2.9.7.  A civilian attorney is required to report, in writing, notice of the commencement of any formal disciplinary complaint or proceeding by the attorney’s licensing authority, through the attorneys’ supervisory Staff Judge Advocate (SJA), Director, Deputy GC, or equivalent, to AF/JAZ or SAF/GCA, as applicable, within five days of initial knowledge of such action.  Additionally, civilian attorneys may be required to participate in license certification programs mandated by the GC or TJAG for their respective attorneys.  Such programs  may  require  attorneys  to  self-certify  bar  status,  the  absence  of  discipline,  the review of professional responsibility rules and codes, and other certifications as needed to ensure  attorney  compliance  with  this  instruction  and  state  licensing  requirements.  Additionally, such programs may include targeted or random independent verification of licensing status.  1.3.  Authorities.  Air Force civilian attorneys are appointed under the following authorities: 1.3.1.  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  Regulations  (implementing  Title  5  United States  Code)  at  Title  5,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations,  Part  213,  Excepted  Service,  current edition; 1.3.2.  Non-U.S. citizens recruited in areas outside the 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands  are  appointed  under  authority  of  Title  5,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations,  Section  8.3, Appointment of Persons Not Citizens of the United States, current edition; and 1.3.3.  DODI 1442.02. Section 1B—Qualifying Authority AFI51-107  24 October 2011   7  1.4.  Qualifying  Authority.  The  qualifying  authority  evaluates  the  qualifications  of  persons recommended for appointment, transfer, reassignment, or promotion as attorneys, and approves or disapproves such actions.  The Air Force Civilian Attorney Qualifying Committee (AFCAQC) is the qualifying authority for all civilian attorney personnel actions, except where the authority is delegated pursuant to paragraph 1.5. 1.4.1.  Air Force Civilian Attorney Qualifying Committee.  The AFCAQC is composed of three or more civilian attorneys in grades GS-15 or above, designated by the Secretary of the Air Force.  The  AFCAQC is  solely  responsible for, and has complete discretion to,  qualify and  approve  appointments,  promotions,  reassignments,  and  transfer  of  persons  to  attorney positions.    However,  the  AFCAQC  does  not  have  authority  to  set  pay.    AF/JAZ  will administer all actions for the AFCAQC and ensure compliance with  applicable statutes and OPM,  DOD,  and  Air  Force  guidance.    At  the  request  of  the  GC  or  TJAG,  or  on  its  own initiative, the AFCAQC provides advice and makes recommendations to the GC and TJAG concerning  any  aspect  of  the  civilian  attorney  workforce.    When  matters  pertain  to  civilian development, the AFCAQC will also coordinate with the appropriate council. 1.4.2.  Approval.  When  the  qualifying  authority  decides  that  a  candidate  meets  the requirements for a given position, it approves the appointment.  Thereafter, that attorney may be  transferred  or  reassigned  to  any  position  within  the  grade  for  which  approved,  or  to  a lower  grade,  without  further  approval  by  the  qualifying  authority,  unless  the  move  would result in a substantial change in duties. 1.4.3.  Reservations.  The AFCAQC reserves qualifying authority for all GS-14 and GS-15 hiring  actions,  all  hiring  actions  using  accelerated  procedures,  all  promotions  to  GS-14  or GS-15 (including upgrades to target grades of GS-14 and GS-15 in developmental positions), and all promotions of attorneys with less than one year time-in-grade. 1.5.  Delegation  of  Qualifying  Authority.  Qualifying  authority  is  delegated  to  the  following Air Force attorneys: 1.5.1.  Hiring Attorneys Using Fully Competitive Procedures (see Chapter 2).  Authority to approve qualifications of candidates to positions graded at GS-13 and below and approve appointments  to  those  positions  is  delegated  to  the  Major  Command  (MAJCOM)  SJA,  the Air Force Legal Operations Agency (AFLOA) Commander, Air Staff Director, Deputy GC, or  equivalent.    Authority  to  qualify  candidates  and  approve  GS-14  or  GS-15  appointments remains with the AFCAQC. 1.5.2.  Promoting  Attorneys.  Authority to  promote attorneys to positions graded at  GS-13 and below is delegated to the MAJCOM SJA, the AFLOA Commander, Air Staff Director, Deputy GC, or equivalent. 1.5.2.1.  Authority  to  upgrade  an  attorney  to  the  developmental  position  target  grade  of GS-13 or below is  delegated to  the MAJCOM SJA, the AFLOA Commander, Air Staff Director, Deputy GC, or equivalent. 1.5.2.2.  Authority to promote and approve upgrades to GS-14 or GS-15 remains with the AFCAQC. 1.5.3.  Reassigning Attorneys.  Authority to approve qualifications and reassign attorneys to perform  similar  functions  within  an  organization  in  an  equal  or  lower  graded  position  is   8  AFI51-107  24 October 2011 delegated to the MAJCOM SJA, the AFLOA Commander, Air Staff Director, Deputy GC, or equivalent.    However,  if  the  move  would  result  in  a  substantial  change  in  duties,  approval authority remains with the qualifying authority.  All requests for approval to reassign an Air Force employee from a non-attorney position to an attorney position are treated as new hires (see paragraph 1.5.1). 1.5.4.  Transferring  Attorneys.  Authority to  approve attorney qualifications and transfer a person at the same grade between bases within a MAJCOM or within AFLOA is delegated to the MAJCOM SJA or the AFLOA Commander, respectively.  Authority to approve attorney qualifications  and  transfer  of  a  person  at  the  same  grade  between  MAJCOMs  or  from AFLOA to a MAJCOM is delegated to the gaining MAJCOM SJA; and from a MAJCOM to AFLOA, to the AFLOA Commander.  Any such transfer is subject to all necessary approvals and manpower actions to transfer the position. 1.5.5.  Other  Delegations.  The  AFCAQC  may  make  other  delegations  of  qualifying authority reserved in paragraph 1.4.3, either selectively or by class, in writing, to qualified attorneys (civilian or military) when circumstances warrant. AFI51-107  24 October 2011   9  Chapter 2 FULLY COMPETITIVE HIRING PROCEDURES Section 2A—Overview 2.1.  Hiring  Process  Overview.  The  normal  process  of  filling  civilian  attorney  vacancies closely follows the process used in the competitive service.  The hiring process can begin when an incumbent announces the intent to leave or when a new position is added in the organization. 2.1.1.  To initiate hiring, the office with the vacancy submits a Standard Form 52, Request for Personnel Action,  and a  core document or position description to  the servicing CPO, along with any other documentation required locally by the CPO. 2.1.2.  For new core documents or those with significant changes, the CPO (or the Air Force Personnel  Center)  classifies  the  core  document.    The  CPO  then  begins  recruitment  by preparing an announcement and posting it for a period of at least five business days.  (Note:  Attorney  positions  are  exempt  from  the  Priority  Placement  Program.)    The  CPO  screens applications  received  and  forwards  them  to  the  office  with  the  vacancy,  for  review  by  the local civilian attorney committee (see Section 2B). 2.1.3.  After  reviewing  the  applications,  the  local  civilian  attorney  committee  identifies  the candidates who meet the minimum qualifications and selects some or all for interview by the committee. 2.1.4.  After interviews, the committee identifies the best qualified candidates and forwards a package for approval to the qualifying authority (see Section 4A).  The qualifying authority makes the final hiring decision. Section 2B—Roles, Responsibilities and Procedures 2.2.  Roles,  Responsibilities  and  Procedures.  The  CPO  and  the  local  civilian  attorney committee have key roles and responsibilities in the fully competitive hiring procedure. 2.2.1.  Local  Civilian  Attorney  Committee.  The  commander  of  the  organization  with  the servicing  CPO  will  appoint  an  ad  hoc  local  civilian  attorney  committee  for  each  separate hiring  action.    For  vacancies  in  AFLOA,  the  appointing  authority  is  the  Commander;  for vacancies  in  Headquarters  Air  Force,  the  appointing  authority  is  the  Air  Staff  Director, Deputy GC, or equivalent. 2.2.1.1.  Membership.  The local civilian attorney committee shall consist of at least two attorneys, one of whom is a civilian attorney in the same or higher grade as the position being  filled.    If  fewer  than  two  qualified  attorneys  are  available  to  serve  on  the committee, the MAJCOM or another Air Force activity will make available the necessary attorney(s).  Anyone acting as the qualifying authority  for the position being filled may not also serve on the committee. 2.2.1.2.  Function.  The  local  civilian  attorney  committee  is  responsible  for  reviewing applications  and  interviewing,  evaluating,  and  ranking  applicants  for  appointment  to attorney positions.  The committee prepares interview summaries and recommends to the qualifying authority the best qualified candidates, in rank order.   10  AFI51-107  24 October 2011 2.2.1.3.  Responsibilities.  The  local  civilian  attorney  committee  scores  applicants  on experience,  education,  and  other  professional  qualifications,  using  a  point  system.  Minimum  position  requirements  and  grade-by-grade  guidelines  are in Attachment 2. included 2.2.1.3.1.  Veterans’ Preference.  Follow the guidelines in Attachment 3. 2.2.1.3.2.  Oral Interview.  After ranking the applications, the committee will notify the best qualified candidates to appear for an interview.  Interviews may be conducted either in person, by video-teleconference, or by telephone. 2.2.1.3.2.1.  Purpose  and  Content  of  Oral  Interview.  The  interview  is  an important  element  of  the  screening  process.    It  provides  a  means  to  evaluate aspects of a candidate’s knowledge and background that may not be evident from the  written  record.    It  also  provides  the  opportunity  to  observe  a  candidate’s presentation  skills  and  cognitive  qualities  relative  to  the  requirements  of  the position. 2.2.1.3.2.2.  Preparation of Interview Summaries.  A separate summary of each interview must be prepared, describing the candidate’s suitability and legal skills.  The summary must reflect the factors developed during the interview in order to give the qualifying authority the information necessary for a proper review of the candidate’s  qualifications.    It  includes  comment  on  the  candidate’s  presence, mental qualities and attitudes, knowledge of the law required for the position, and the  quality  of  experience  in  general  and  specific  areas  of  law.    The  summary should  also  include  comment  on  any  relevant  collateral  experience  that  is  not evident  or  clear  in  the  application.    The  conclusions  should  analyze  and summarize  the  applicant’s  qualification  and  suitability  for  the  position.    Follow the format in Attachment 4.  Upon completion of the interview summary, destroy any notes used in its preparation. 2.2.1.3.3.  Furnish  the  qualifying  authority  with  the  applications  and  supporting documentation  for  best  qualified  candidates,  in  accordance  with  Chapter  4.    If  the qualifying authority is the AFCAQC, forward the package to AF/JAZ. 2.2.1.3.4.  The local civilian attorney committee returns all applications, together with interview summaries and candidate rankings, to the servicing CPO. 2.2.2.  Civilian Personnel Office.  The CPO will: 2.2.2.1.  Advertise the position with a vacancy announcement.  Recruitment from within the federal government shall follow the procedures and format used for vacancies in the competitive service. 2.2.2.2.  Receive and review applications and supporting documentation.  Forward those that meet the minimum qualifications for appointment to the office with the vacancy for interviews and selection recommendations. 2.2.2.3.  Upon  receipt  of  approval  by  the  qualifying  authority,  process  all  necessary personnel actions and furnish copies of the completed actions to the AFCAQC, through AF/JAZ. AFI51-107  24 October 2011   11  Chapter 3 ACCELERATED HIRING PROCEDURES Section 3A—Overview 3.1.  Filling  Vacancies  Without  Recruitment  or  Competition.  A  civilian  attorney  vacancy may be filled without recruitment or competition if the following criteria are met: 3.1.1.  Knowledge of a qualified, interested, and available candidate for the position; 3.1.2.  The need for quick action to hire the candidate (i.e., the candidate has other job offers or is actively seeking employment elsewhere); and 3.1.3.  The  reasonable  belief  that  better  qualified  candidates  are  not  likely  to  be  discovered using fully competitive procedures. 3.2.  Streamlined  Process.  These  procedures  eliminate  the  announcement,  formal  recruitment, and  pre-screening  phases  of  the  fully  competitive  process.    Interviews  are  optional  (see paragraph 3.4.1.1). Section 3B—Candidate Files 3.3.  Candidate Files.  Legal offices are encouraged to maintain on file any resumes received for the  types  and  levels  of  civilian  attorney  positions  on  staff,  for  use  when  vacancies  arise.    The offices are also encouraged to share candidate data with other legal offices and refer candidates to offices with vacancies for which they might qualify. Section 3C—Procedures 3.4.  Procedures.  When an office has a civilian attorney vacancy and the criteria of paragraph 3.1 are met, the following procedures may be substituted for those set forth in Chapter 2 of this instruction: 3.4.1.  To initiate a fill action, the office with the vacancy submits to the AFCAQC, through AF/JAZ,  the  candidate’s  name,  a  letter  from  the  SJA,  civilian  office  chief,  or  equivalent addressing  the  three  criteria,  the  additional  documentation  required  by  Chapter  4,  and evidence of coordination, as applicable, with the MAJCOM SJA, AFLOA Commander, Air Staff Director, Deputy GC, or equivalent. 3.4.1.1.  The  SJA,  civilian  office  chief,  or  equivalent  may  personally  interview  the candidate  or  convene  a  local  civilian  attorney  committee  to  do  so,  in  accordance  with paragraph 2.2.1. 3.4.1.2.  The party conducting the interview will prepare an interview summary and make a recommendation to the AFCAQC. 3.4.2.  Following approval from the AFCAQC, the office with the vacancy submits an SF 52 with  the  approval  package  received  from  the  AFCAQC  (see  paragraph  4.2.2),  to  the servicing CPO, along with any other documentation required locally by the CPO.   12  AFI51-107  24 October 2011 3.4.3.  Upon  receipt  of  the  approval  package,  the  CPO  processes  all  necessary  personnel actions and furnishes copies of the completed actions to the AFCAQC, through AF/JAZ. AFI51-107  24 October 2011   13  Chapter 4 QUALIFYING AUTHORITY ACTION Section 4A—Request for Qualifying Authority Action 4.1.

The  qualifying  authority  reviews  the applications, supporting data, and local civilian attorney committee recommendations to make its own determinations.  If only one qualified candidate has been submitted, the qualifying authority may  approve  or  disapprove  the  nomination  for  appointment.    If  more  than  one  qualified candidate has been submitted, the qualifying authority may approve any or all of the candidates, and approve or change the rank order submitted. 4.2.1.  Qualifying authorities may, at their discretion, interview any or all of the candidates. 4.2.2.  The  qualifying  authority  returns  the  applications  and  supporting  documents,  along with  its decision, to  the office with  the vacancy,  which in  turn forwards the material  to  the servicing CPO for processing. Section 4C—Other Qualifying Authority Actions 4.3.  Other  Actions  Requiring  Qualifying  Authority  Review.  Other  personnel  actions  also require review and approval by the qualifying authority. 4.3.1.  Promotions.  Any proposed promotion of a civilian attorney (including promotion to the  target  grade  of  a  developmental  position,  promotion  following  a  position  review,  or promotion after full and open competition) shall be submitted to the qualifying authority for approval or disapproval.

An  evaluation  by  the  attorney’s  supervisor  addressing  the  quality  of  the attorney’s work and providing an opinion as to the attorney’s ability to perform the duties in the new activity; and 4.3.1.3.  Statements  from  both  the  losing  and  gaining  supervisors  consenting  to  the proposed transfer (unless the transfer is the result of the employee’s application). AFI51-107  24 October 2011   15  Chapter 5 ADMINISTRATION Section 5A—Selection Processing 5.1.  Selection Processing.  Upon receipt of approval from the qualifying authority, the servicing CPO processes the action directed by the qualifying authority. 5.1.1.  If, in a hiring action, the qualifying authority ranked candidates in order of preference, the CPO  must follow the order in  making offers.    If the highest-ranked  candidate declines the offer, the process may be restarted, at the discretion of the office with the vacancy, rather than offering the position to a remaining candidate. 5.1.2.  If  the  hiring  action  involves  superior  qualifications,  the  office  with  the  vacancy  and the servicing CPO follow the guidance in AFI 36-802, Pay Setting. 5.1.3.  Approval  from  the  qualifying  authority  is  valid  for  four  months  from  the  date  of signature,  during  which  all  initial  selection  offers  must  be  made.    If  an  offer  is  not  made during this period, a new package is required, unless the qualifying authority, upon request, grants an extension. Section 5B—Changes 5.2.  Changes.  Any significant change to the duties of the position at any time during the hiring process  requires  reclassification  of  the  core  document  and  re-initiation  of  the  process  (see paragraph 2.1.2). Section 5C—Retention of Documentation 5.3.  Retention of Documentation. 5.3.1.  The  servicing  CPO  retains  all  necessary  records  and  correspondence  supporting  the personnel  action, in  accordance with the Air Force RDS and applicable OPM guidance, for documents that are OPM records. 5.3.1.1.  The  office  with  the  vacancy  returns  the  original  applications  of  those  not selected  to  the  servicing  CPO.    The  office  also  sends  an  appropriate  letter  to  each  non-selected  applicant  expressing  appreciation  for  the  application,  informing  that  selection has  been  made,  and  advising  that  another  application  would  be  required  for  any  future vacancy. 5.3.1.2.  The  office  may  also  retain  copies  of  the  applications  to  identify  candidates  for future vacancies (see paragraph 3.3). 5.3.2.  The qualifying authority retains copies of all approved actions. Section 5D—Personnel Actions   16  AFI51-107  24 October 2011 5.4.  Personnel  Actions.  The  CPO  must  forward  a  copy  of  each  Standard  Form  50-B, Notification of Personnel Action, effecting an appointment, promotion, reassignment, or transfer of a civilian attorney, to AF/JAZ, by email or mail.

Bar  membership  status  requirement  for  Air  Force  employment.  Active  (or  equivalent)  status  indicates  an  attorney  holds  a  license  that  authorizes  the attorney  to  engage  in  the  immediate,  active  practice  of  law  in  the  jurisdiction  of  the licensing authority.  State licensure types such as  “inactive,” “retired,” “non—practicing,” “emeritus,” or “ineligible,” which do not  permit  the immediate, active practice of law,  will not satisfy this requirement, even if the member is in “good standing.”  Members may hold an active (or equivalent) license and claim exemptions from dues or CLE (e.g., for federal practice or out-of-state attorneys); but an exemption that precludes the immediate, active practice of law will not satisfy  this  licensing  requirement.    For  example,  a  “non-practicing  CLE  exemption”  that AFI51-107  24 October 2011   19  effectively requires an attorney to affirm he or she is not engaged in the practice of law will not satisfy the active (or equivalent) requirement.  A license that precludes  representing individuals or institutions in a private capacity, but otherwise permits the immediate, active practice of law in the jurisdiction, meets the requirement for Air Force practice.    20  AFI51-107  24 October 2011 Attachment 2 ATTORNEY QUALIFICATIONS A2.1.  General.  The following qualifications are required of all Air Force civilian attorneys. A2.1.1.  To be eligible for consideration for appointment as an attorney, an applicant must be a graduate of a law school accredited by the American Bar Association. A2.1.2.  Additionally, to be eligible for consideration for appointment, a candidate must be an active (or equivalent) member, in good standing, of the bar of the highest court of a state, U.S. commonwealth, U.S. territory, or the District of Columbia. A2.1.2.1.  Law  school  graduates  may  apply  for  and  be  appointed  to  positions  as  law clerks  without  having  been  admitted  to  a  bar.    Any  individual  appointed  under  this authority  may  serve  for  no  more  than  14  months  before  being  admitted  to  a  bar,  or otherwise be separated. A2.1.2.2.  The hiring of a law clerk admitted to a bar as an attorney requires a new hire action and approval by the qualifying authority. A2.1.3.  Appointments  will be made on the basis of merit and in accordance with  veterans’ preference principles (see Attachment 3) and applicable OPM rules and regulations.  Subject to this requirement, when more than one applicant for a particular civilian attorney position meets the minimum requirements for appointment, the applicant who is best qualified on the basis of relevant experience, education, and achievement in the legal field shall be selected.  Other  factors  involving  effectiveness  to  perform  the  functions  of  the  position  may  also  be considered. A2.1.4.  For selectees  entering the Air  Force from  outside the civil  service, the duties to  be performed  are  the  critical  factor  in  determining  the  grade  or  pay  entrance  level.    The possession of a degree or high academic standing alone is not a sufficient basis for placement in a higher GS grade and step level. A2.2.  Grade-by-Grade Guidelines.  The following grade-level guidelines shall be applicable to initial  appointments  and  promotions  to  civilian  attorney  positions  in  the  indicated  grade  or equivalent: A2.2.1.  GS-9. A2.2.1.1.  Duties Performed at GS-9 Level.  Assignments are considered developmental and  involve  legal  or  factual  questions  that  require  relatively  easy  research  on  clear-cut issues  with  adequate  precedents.    Other  legal  questions  at  the  GS-9  level  are  difficult because of the complexity of the facts or the different possible constructions that may be placed  on  either  the  facts  or  the  laws  involved.    Cases  are  strongly  contested  in  formal hearings or informal negotiations by the individuals, corporations, or agencies involved.  In  cases  of  this  scope,  GS-9  entrance-level  attorneys  search  case  reports,  legal documents, periodicals,  and textbooks, and prepare drafts of letters, memorandums, and legal  documents  for  use  by  higher-level  attorneys.    They  assist  attorneys  in  charge  of court  cases  or  administrative  proceedings  by  interviewing  and  selecting  witnesses, preparing  them  to  give  testimony,  and  suggesting  questions  to  be  asked  in  cross-examination. AFI51-107  24 October 2011   21  A2.2.1.2.  Level of Supervision.  Attorneys who enter at the GS-9 level work under very close supervision.  They receive specific preliminary instructions, their authority is very limited, and their completed written work is carefully and closely reviewed. law  degree A2.2.1.3.  Qualifications.  Assignments  require (Bachelor  of  Laws  [LL.B.]  or  Juris  Doctorate  [J.D.])  and  active  (or  equivalent) membership,  in  good  standing,  in  the  bar  of  the  highest  court  of  a  state,  U.S. commonwealth,  U.S.  territory,  or  the  District  of  Columbia.    No  additional  work experience as a licensed attorney is required. the  first  professional A2.2.2.  GS-11. A2.2.2.1.  Duties Performed at GS-11.  Assignments, while still developmental, involve complex  and  difficult  legal  questions,  requiring  extensive  research,  analysis,  and evaluation  of  information  in  controversial  areas.    Cases  have  an  important  impact  on major public and private interests, such as cases concerning a major extension or revision in  a  grant  program  or  a  substantial  question  on  civil  rights.    Cases  are  vigorously contested by capable legal talent, as in contract dispute cases.  In cases of this scope, GS-11  attorneys  prepare  drafts  of  pleadings  and  motions  in  connection  with  cases  in litigation.    They  conduct  investigations  to  obtain  facts,  study  legal  precedents,  and prepare  recommendations.    They  assist  attorneys  in  charge  of  court  cases  by  cross-examining  witnesses  and  by  drafting  findings  of  fact,  conclusions  of  law,  and  orders based upon the record. A2.2.2.2.  Level  of  Supervision.  Attorneys  who  enter  at  the  GS-11  level  work  under close  supervision.  They  receive  specific  preliminary  instructions,  their  commitment authority is limited, and their completed written work is carefully reviewed. A2.2.2.3.  Qualifications  Required  at  GS-11  Level.  Assignments  require  the  first professional  law degree  (LL.B. or J.D.) and active (or equivalent) membership, in  good standing, in the bar of the highest court of a state, U.S. commonwealth, U.S. territory, or the  District  of  Columbia.    In  addition,  one  of  the  following  requirements  must  be satisfied: A2.2.2.3.1.  One year of professional law experience; or A2.2.2.3.2.  The second professional law degree (Master of Laws [LL.M.]), provided it required at least one full academic year of graduate study; or A2.2.2.3.3.  Superior  law  student  work  or  activities,  as  demonstrated  by  one  of  the following: A2.2.2.3.3.1.  Academic  standing  in  the  upper  third  of  the  attorney’s  law  school graduating class; A2.2.2.3.3.2.  Work  or  achievement  of  significance  on  one  of  the  attorney’s  law school’s official law reviews or journals; A2.2.2.3.3.3.  Special  high-level  honors  for  academic  excellence  in  law  school (e.g., membership in the Order of the Coif, winning a moot court competition, or membership on the moot court team that represents the law school in competition with other law schools);   22  AFI51-107  24 October 2011 A2.2.2.3.3.4.  Full-time  or  continuous  participation  in  a  legal  aid  program,  as opposed to one-time, intermittent, or casual participation; A2.2.2.3.3.5.  Significant summer law office clerk experience; or A2.2.2.3.3.6.  Other evidence of clearly superior accomplishment or achievement. A2.2.3.  GS-12. A2.2.3.1.  Duties  Performed at GS-12 Level.  Assignments involve extremely complex and  difficult  legal  questions  requiring  extensive  research,  analysis,  and  evaluation  of information in controversial areas of scientific, financial, corporate, medical, engineering, or  other  highly  technical  areas.    Cases  have  an  important  impact  on  major  private  or public interests, such as those involving a major extension or revision in a grant program or a substantial question on civil rights. Interest in these cases is usually nationwide.  GS-12 entrance-level attorneys are entrusted with the initial preparation of proposed solutions to  projects.    To  this  end,  they  conduct  investigations  to  obtain  facts,  study  legal precedents, make recommendations, and prepare necessary documents. A2.2.3.2.  Level  of  Supervision.  Attorneys  who  enter  at  the  GS-12  level  work  under close supervision.  They receive preliminary instructions, their commitment authority is limited, and their completed written work is carefully reviewed. A2.2.3.3.  Qualifications Required at GS-12 Level. A2.2.3.3.1.  Assignments require the first professional law degree (LL.B. or J.D.) and active (or equivalent) membership, in good standing, in the bar of the highest court of a state, U.S. commonwealth, U.S. territory, or the District of Columbia.  In addition, one of the following requirements must be satisfied: A2.2.3.3.1.1.  Two  years  of  professional  legal  experience  at  or  equivalent  to  the GS-11 level or NSPS YA2 level; or A2.2.3.3.1.2.  The  second  professional  law  degree  (LL.M.),  plus  one  year  of professional legal experience at the GS-11 level or NSPS YA2 level. A2.2.3.3.2.  An  attorney  without  experience,  may  in  unusual  cases,  be  employed  at the  GS-12  level,  provided  the  individual  has  advanced  educational  attainments substantially  beyond  those  required  for  work  at  the  GS-11  level,  and  his  or  her education  clearly  indicates  ability  to  perform  work  of  the  type  to  be  assigned  (e.g., education  that  included  courses  directly  pertinent  to  the  work  of  the  agency).    The essential point in  such cases is  to  ensure that the individual’s education has enabled him or her to  step into complete legal  work characteristic of the GS-12 level  and to operate with the degree of independence and responsibility typical of that level. A2.2.4.  GS-13. A2.2.4.1.  Qualifications  Required  at  GS-13  Level.  Assignments  require  the  first professional  law degree  (LL.B. or J.D.) and active (or equivalent) membership, in  good standing, in the bar of the highest court of a state, U.S. commonwealth, U.S. territory, or the District of Columbia. A2.2.4.2.  In addition,  the attorney shall have  professional  legal  experience in  excess  of two years that is commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of the position. AFI51-107  24 October 2011   23  A2.2.5.  GS-14 or GS-15. A2.2.5.1.  Qualifications Required at GS-14 or GS-15 Level.  Assignments require the first  professional  law  degree  (LL.B.  or  J.D.)  and  active  (or  equivalent)  membership,  in good  standing,  in  the  bar  of  the  highest  court  of  a  state,  U.S.  commonwealth,  U.S. territory,  or  the  District  of  Columbia.    In  addition,  the  attorney  shall  have  professional legal  experience  in  excess  of  three  years  that  is  commensurate  with  the  duties  and responsibilities of the position. A2.2.5.2.  Level  of  Supervision.  Attorneys  performing  duties  in  GS-15  positions  are expected  to  perform  with  substantial  independence,  even  when  working  on  the  most complex or difficult matters. A2.2.6.  Senior Leader (SL). A2.2.6.1.  Qualifications  Required  at  SL  Level.  Assignments  require the  first professional  law degree  (LL.B. or J.D.) and active (or equivalent) membership, in good standing, in the bar of the highest court of a state, U.S. commonwealth, U.S. territory, or the  District  of  Columbia.    In  addition,  assignment  at  the  SL  level  requires  substantial professional  legal  experience.    To  qualify  for  this  level,  individuals  must  possess sufficient  expertise  and  experience  to  be  recognized  as  experts  in  their  fields.    The requirements of Title 5 United States Code, Section 5376 apply. A2.2.6.2.  The Executive Resources Board must approve all SL allotments and selections. A2.3.  The  qualification  requirements  and  grade-level  guidelines  set  forth  above  shall  not preclude the initial appointment of applicants at grades lower than prescribed herein. A2.4.  The qualifying authority may make exceptions to the foregoing grade-level guidelines set forth in paragraph A2.2 for applicants possessing special experience or qualifications of a legal or  non-legal  nature  that  will  be  of  material  value  in  performing  the  duties  of  the  position  to which the civilian attorney is appointed.  Such experience may have been gained either before or after admission to the bar.  However, the qualifying authority may NOT make exceptions to the basic qualification requirements of graduation from law school, admission to the bar, and active (or equivalent) bar membership in good standing.    24  AFI51-107  24 October 2011 Attachment 3 VETERANS’ PREFERENCE A3.1.  Excepted  service  Air  Force  civilian  attorney  positions  are  wholly  exempted  from  the appointment  procedures  in  Title  5,  Code  of  Federal  Regulation,  Part  302,  Employment  in  the Excepted  Service,  current  edition.    However,  the  principles  of  veterans’  preference  will  be followed  in  hiring  civilian  attorneys  as  far  as  administratively  feasible,  as  provided  for  in  this attachment. A3.2.  Selecting  officials  must  treat  veterans’  preference  eligibility  as  a  positive  factor  in  all stages of the hiring process,  including the review process,  when making a selection from  a job announcement  or  recruitment  open  to  all  sources,  or  when  veterans’  preference  is  otherwise applicable as required by law. A3.2.1.  At each point in the review process when a decision is made to eliminate candidates from further consideration, the selecting official shall ascertain whether any of the applicants under  review  are  preference  eligible  and,  in  borderline  cases,  continue  to  consider  those applicants. A3.2.2.  When  making  final  selections  (i.e.,  at  the  point  the  candidates  under  serious consideration  for  an  offer  have  been  identified),  the  selecting  official  shall  once  again ascertain whether any of the candidates are preference eligible.  If all relevant considerations for  the  position  are  deemed  equal,  the  selecting  official  must  select  the  preference-eligible veteran, as opposed to an equally well qualified, non-preference-eligible candidate.  Further, if  all  relevant  considerations  for  the  position  are  deemed  equal  and  there  is  more  than  one preference-eligible veteran in the final group of candidates, the selecting official must select from the preference-eligible veterans in the following order: A3.2.2.1.  Disabled veterans qualifying for a 10-point preference. A3.2.2.2.  Other 10-point preference eligibles, including Purple Heart recipients. A3.2.2.3.  Veterans qualifying for a 5-point preference. A3.3.  If a qualified, preference-eligible applicant requests information regarding his or her non-selection, the responding official will advise the applicant that it is DoD policy to hire the most qualified  applicant,  taking  into  consideration  all  factors,  including,  if  applicable,  veterans’ preference  eligibility,  and  that  a  selection  was  made  on  that  basis.    Responses  do  not  follow templates applicable to competitive service positions or disclose personal information about the civilian  attorney  hired  for  the  position  because  selections  for  civilian  attorney  positions  are excepted,  not  competitive,  hires.    The  responding  official  may  advise  the  preference-eligible veteran of this instruction and shall, upon request, furnish him or her with the reasons  for non-selection. A3.4.  Vacancy announcements for Air Force civilian attorney positions for selection from all sources or for which consideration of veterans’ preference is otherwise required must include the notice in the figure. AFI51-107  24 October 2011   25  Figure A3.1.  Notice of Veterans’ Preference. NOTICE OF VETERANS’ PREFERENCE  There is no formal rating system for applying veterans’ preference to attorney appointments in the excepted service; however, the Department of Defense considers veterans’ preference eligibility a positive factor for attorney hiring.  Applicants eligible for veterans’ preference must include that information in their cover letter or resume and attach supporting documentation (e.g., DD Form 214, “Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty”) to their submissions.  Although the point-preference system is not used, applicants eligible to claim a 10-point preference must submit a Standard Form (SF) 15, “Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference,” and supporting documentation required for the specific type of preference claimed.  (SF 15, which lists the types of 10-point preference and the required supporting documents, is available from the Office of Personnel Management Website at www.opm.gov.)     26  AFI51-107  24 October 2011 Attachment 4 FORMAT FOR SUMMARY OF ORAL INTERVIEW POSITION TITLE AND GRADE:  _________________    NAME OF APPLICANT:  _________________________________________________   GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:  (Presence, mental qualities, and attitudes; nature of questions asked and quality of responses, including reasoning, logic, and communications skills)  LEGAL QUALIFICATIONS/SKILLS:  (Knowledge of the law, as required by the position, and quality of experience in general and specific areas of law)   CONCLUSIONS:  (Analysis and summary of applicant’s qualifications and suitability)     (Date) ______________ Signatures and Titles of Committee Members__________________
