In addition to general qualifications, government personnel may  meet  the  third  party  inspector  requirements  in  paragraph  4.7  with  additional  training.  Government  personnel  responsible  for  inspection  and  acceptance  of  contracts,  including SABER  contracts,  on  facilities  with  LPS  installation  have  the  following  requirements.  For official  (designated  in  writing  by  the  BCE)  CE  inspectors,  advanced  qualifications  shall  be renewed every three years.  Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units and the Air National Guard (ANG) may comply with  UFC 3-575-01, Lightning and Static Electricity Protection Systems,  in  lieu  of  these  advanced  qualifications,  by  complying  with  paragraph  3-1,  for  a third-party inspector.  (T-1). 6.2.1.  Qualifications in paragraph 6.1 as a pre-requisite. 6.2.2.  Attendance  and  completion  of  the  Senior  Inspector  AMMO-50  course,  or equivalent, with completion certificate.

The  organization  performing  inspections  and  tests  must  develop standard  procedures  based  on  the  requirements  in  this  instruction.  To  avoid  potential  security issues, inspection information providing the facility name, facility number, street address, and/or base on which the facility is  located must not  be posted to  any site available for public access. (T-0). Section B—Grounding Resistance and Continuity Tests and Visual Inspections 8.  Testing Requirements.  See Attachment 6 for resistance and continuity test requirements for typical systems. Instruments must be able to measure 10 ohms +10 percent for ground resistance tests  and  1  ohm  +10  percent  for  continuity  testing.  Only  instruments  designed  specifically  for earth-ground  systems  are  acceptable  for  ground  resistance  testing.  Follow  the  manufacturer’s instruction  manual  except  as  modified  herein  when  using  the  instruments.  Earth-ground resistance  should  be  less  than  25  ohms  at  the  service  grounding  electrode  unless  otherwise specified  in  this  instruction.    Note.  The  National  Electrical  Code  (Articles  250.52  and  250.53) does not require 25 ohms to ground for a ground ring (counterpoise), therefore, ground rings are not  required  to  be  tested  for  resistance;  resistance  test  requirements  are  for  the  grounding electrodes  bonded  to  the  ground  ring.    Continuity  testing  is  required  for  the  ground  ring (counterpoise).    Periodic  tests  should  be  made  at  approximately  the  same  time  each  year  to minimize  distortions  to  readings  resulting  from  seasonal  changes  (see  Attachment  2).  If  the resistance measured during continuity tests is greater than 1 ohm, check for deficiencies, repair, then retest. When performing a continuity test over very long lengths of conductors (more than 65  feet  [20  meters]  with  no  parallel  paths),  readings  above  1  ohm  but  less  than  3  ohms  may occur. This can be due to the added resistance of the test wire and is acceptable. Documentation is  required  for  the  file.  The  base  electrical  engineer  may  modify  the  test  procedures  to compensate for local conditions as long as the intent of the test is still met. 9.  Visual Inspections of Lightning Protection Systems.  Inspector will inspect all visible parts of the system. (T-1). Pulling or tugging on conductors and connections to ensure soundness is a necessary  part  of  these  inspections,  but  be  careful  not  to  damage  the  system  in  the  process. Visual/physical inspection must determine if: 9.1.  The system is in good repair. 9.2.  Loose connections might be causing high-resistance joints. 9.3.  Corrosion or vibration has weakened any part of the system. 9.4.  Down  conductors,  roof  conductors,  ground  terminals  and  all  other  components  are intact, air terminals exceeding 24 inches in length are supported at a point not less than one-half their length, and no components or fasteners are missing. 9.5.  Braided bonding wires or straps are excessively frayed (cross-sectional area reduced by half). 22 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 9.6.  Ground  wires/down  conductors,  air  terminals  (for  earth-covered  magazines  [ECM]), masts, or poles are/have been damaged by mowers, equipment, or vehicles. 9.7.  Conductors and system components are securely fastened to mounting surfaces. Position connections to better protect against accidental displacement. Adhesive-type fasteners are not allowed. 9.8.  Project  additions  or  alterations  to  the  protected  structure  require  additional  protection. See UFC 3-575-01. 9.9.  Surge  protective  devices  (SPDs)  supporting  facilities  and  facility  service  appear damaged or indicator lamps  signal  an operation  has occurred.  Note:  Inspection, repair,  and replacement of SPDs protecting equipment are the responsibility of the equipment owner or user. 9.10.  The system complies with the intent of applicable sections of the most recent version of NFPA 780, Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems, unless otherwise noted in this AFI. (T-1). 10.  Visual Inspection of Facility Grounds.  Unless otherwise specified by references in Table 1,  conduct  visual  inspections  as  follows.  Inspect  all  visible  and  accessible  parts  of  the  facility grounding  system.  Validate  satisfactory  condition  and  verify  the  installation  meets  NEC requirements (T-1). Typical items to check include: 10.1.  The system is in good repair. 10.2.  No loose connections are visible. 10.3.  The system neutral is grounded at the service entrance. This may be achieved either by bonding the neutral bus to the ground bus in the main distribution panel or by connection to the grounding electrode (single point ground) for the facility. 10.4.  Separately derived systems are properly grounded. 10.5.  Flashover  protection  (bonding)  is  installed  on  insulating  fittings  on  underground metallic pipelines entering the facility. 10.6.  Grounding systems and static systems  within the facility are bonded together at  floor level or at or below ground level outside the building. Section C—Grounding and Lightning Protection Requirements 11.  Introduction.  This  section  covers  requirements  for  grounding  and  lightning  protection systems,  including  systems  installed  on  or  in  areas  such  as  explosives  buildings,  magazines, operating  locations,  and  aircraft  shelters.  Use  these  requirements  when  inspecting  to  determine compliance  and  when  repairing  or  modifying  systems.  See  AFMAN  91-201,  Explosive  Safety Standards. 12.  Testing and Inspecting Static and Lightning Protection Systems and Grounding. 12.1.  Procedures.  Use  Attachment  4  and  Attachment  5  as  a  guide  for  establishing  proper maintenance procedures and as a self-check prior to inspections. 12.2.  Inspection and Testing.  Visually inspect and test the static, grounding, and lightning protection  systems  for  buildings  and  facilities  in  accordance  with  Section  A,  Maintenance AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 23 Policy,  and  Section  B,  Grounding  Resistance  and  Continuity  Tests  and  Visual  Inspections, and the special requirements in this section. (T-1). 12.3.  Records.  Inspectors  and  testers  will  keep  test  and  inspection  records  in  accordance with DODD 6055.09-M-V2, Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards for a minimum of six  inspection  cycles.  (T-1).  Figure  1  is  an  example  sketch  of  a  grounding  and  lightning protection system with test points. Figure 1.  Example Sketch of Test Points (Typical).    24 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 13.  Static Protection. 13.1.  Static  Protection  for  Electronics  and  Electrical  Equipment.  The  best  methods  to eliminate  or  reduce  the  hazard  from  static  electricity  are  bonding  and  grounding.  Bonding minimizes potential differences between conductive objects. Grounding minimizes potential differences  between  objects  and  the  ground.  Inspectors  will  inspect  and  test  facilities  for compliance with NFPA 77, Static Electricity, which contains the minimum acceptable static grounding and bonding requirements for Air Force activities, except as modified in this AFI. (T-0). See Attachment 3. 13.1.1.  Bonding  conductors  shall  be  large  enough  to  withstand  mechanical  damage. Minimum size for existing bonding conductors is AWG No. 8. If bonding conductors are in areas of high use or are subject to physical damage, make repairs with wires no smaller than AWG No. 6 copper. Static grounds for portable or movable equipment  must be of braided cable for added flexibility. (T-0). 13.1.2.  Static  grounds  shall  be  10,000  ohms  to  ground  or  less,  unless  otherwise  stated. Static  electricity  creates  extremely  small  (on  the  magnitude  of  milliamps)  currents,  so even  this  large  resistance  is  small  enough  to  bleed  off  static  charges.  But  because  the static grounding system  must be connected to  the facility  grounding system,  resistances of less than 25 ohms are common. (T-0). 13.2.  Static Bus Bars.  Static bus bars are usually 2-inch by 0.25-inch copper bars installed on the interior wall of the facility. The length will vary for new facilities but design the bar itself to be no closer than 12 inches from the intersection of an interior wall with an exterior wall  for  side-flash  reasons.  See  Figure  2  for  bus  bar  end  and  for  transition  at  floor  level, around  windows,  and  doorways  (requires  depression  for  ground  wire).  Design  the  down conductor location so that it does not “cross” an interior static bus bar. For existing facilities at  which  this  condition  exists,  perform  side-flash  calculations  to  ensure  that  the  wall thickness exceeds the side flash distance. Typically, the side flash distance through the wall, using  the  basic  bonding  formula  (BBF),  exceeds  the  calculated  side-flash  distance  at  the normal  static  bus  bar  height  up  to  48  inches  (1.2  meters).  If  installed  within  side  flash distance,  relocate  either  the  down  conductor  or  discontinue  the  static  bus  bar  1  foot  (0.3 meter) either side of the exterior down conductor location and bond the two sections of the static bus bar at floor level, using a 1/0 copper conductor. Note: For structures exceeding 250 feet (76 meters) in perimeter, if relocating the down conductor results in a separation distance of  greater  than  100  feet  (30.5  meters)  between  down  conductors,  an  additional  down conductor  may  be  necessary.  The  grounding  conductor  from  the  static  bus  bar  shall  be connected  directly  to  the  facility  grounding  electrode  system.  See  Attachment  6  for  testing requirements.  Use  static  bus  bars  only  for  static  grounding.  Communications  systems, electrical conduit, intrusion detection systems, and other permanently installed systems shall not use the static bus bar as a system ground. As a general rule, do not connect a static bus to any  facility  metal  body  or  use  this  bus  to  ground  structural  components  of  a  facility; however, coincidental connections of the bus bar through its anchoring/mounting system are acceptable,  as  is  the  mounting  of  the  static  bars  on  the  skin  of  a  metal  structure.  Portable grounding straps from equipment to the static grounding bus are not real property; therefore, visual inspections and continuity checks for these straps are the responsibility of the user. (T-0). AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 25 Figure 2.  Grounding Static Bus Bar on Interior Wall.    26 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 13.3.  Belting Requirements.  On equipment such as belt-driven compressors and conveyor belts,  if  static  electricity  is  a  hazard,  use  non-static-producing  belting.  Belting  must  have  a resistance  not  exceeding  1,000,000  ohms  when  measured  according  to  IEEE  Standard  142, IEEE Recommended Practice for Grounding for Industrial and Commercial Power Systems (Green Book), Chapter 3. (T-0). 13.4.  Conductive  Floor  Grounds.  If  the  electronic  equipment  within  a  facility  requires  a resistance of the floor-to-ground of less than 1,000,000 ohms, a conductive floor is required.   This resistance value is the sum of the resistance of the floor plus a person, added together.  Static  dissipative  footwear  (PPE)  will  ensure  protection  for  personnel  from  electric  shock hazard  and  will  allow  bleed-off  of  static  buildup  in  personnel  and  equipment.    Testing requirements  are  in  the  appendices  of  this  document.    Using  agency  must  keep  a  record  of test results.  (T-1). 14.  Lightning  Protection  Systems.  The  following  requirements  will  be  used  as  a  guide  for facilities that require or possess lightning protection. (T-1). 14.1.  General.  Systems  must  comply  with  NFPA  780  and  UFC  3-575-01,  whichever  is more  restrictive  (except  as  modified  herein).  (T-0).  See  Attachment  4.    Early  streamer emission  systems,  charge  dissipation  systems,  or  other  unconventional  systems  are  not permitted.  Parts  and  materials  must  carry  the  Underwriters  Laboratories  (UL)  label  or equivalent, and must be listed for use on lightning protection systems. (T-0). Components not carrying a UL label or equivalent, or components carrying a UL label or equivalent and not listed  for  use  on  lightning  protection  systems,  must  be  approved  by  the  BCE  or  designated representative. (T-2). Facilities in foreign countries may use host nation codes and standards if  they  offer  equivalent  protection,  as  determined  by  the  BCE,  with  concurrence  from AFCEC/COSM and, for facilities housing explosives, approval of the DOD Explosive Safety Board (DDESB). (T-0). Otherwise, the status of forces agreement (SOFA) must specifically permit the use of host nation codes. Where the SOFA requires compliance with host nation codes,  translate  those  required  codes  into  English,  make  them  available  to  all  appropriate personnel, and conduct necessary training. Maintain all installed systems in accordance with this  instruction.  If  an  existing  lightning  protection  system  is  no  longer  required,  coordinate with the facility manager to remove the LPS. Test records of the LPS must remain with the facility for six inspection cycles. (T-1). 14.2.  Bonding  Requirements.  Adequate  bonding  is  more  important  than  grounding. Bonding  ensures  all  metallic  objects  are  at  equal  potentials  to  protect  personnel  against dangerous  arcs  or  flashovers.  Inspectors  will  inspect  and  test  facilities  for  compliance  with NFPA 780 and Attachment 3 (T-0). 14.3.  Resistance  to  Ground.  Low  resistance  is  desirable  but  not  essential  for  lightning protection.  For  most  facilities  and  per  NEC  Article  250.53,  resistance  to  ground  should  be less than 25 ohms at the service grounding electrode. If 25 ohms cannot be achieved with the addition  of  a  grounding  electrode,  a  supplemental  electrode  may  be  necessary,  depending upon the magnitude of resistance obtained and the contents of a facility being protected. The resistance to ground of a ground loop conductor is acceptable even if greater than 25 ohms. See Attachment 2. AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 27 14.4.  Lightning  Protection identifies explosives  facilities  that  require  lightning  protection  systems.  Use  the  basic  practices  in Attachment 4, with the following additions: for  Explosives  Facilities.  AFMAN  91-201 14.4.1.  The system shall be designed for a 100-foot (30.5-meter) striking distance. (T-0). Note: an administrative, educational, or other non-explosives-type facility located within a weapons or munitions storage area may be designed for a 150-foot (45.7-meter) striking distance. 14.4.2.  Installation of test wells or hand holes at corner grounding electrodes for existing connections to grounding electrodes is recommended to aid with access for testing unless conductors  are  exothermically  welded  to  the  grounding  electrode  and  the  exothermic weld is shown on record drawings. 14.4.3.  Replace  existing  bolted  connectors  on  down  conductors  and  roof  conductors, when  in  need  of  repair,  with  high  compression  or  exothermic-weld  type  connectors. Connections to air terminals are an exception, but they must be tight and in good repair. Bolted  connections  to  aluminum  bodies  (such  as  vents)  and  to  metal  bodies  for  the purpose of bonding are also  acceptable. Brazing  to  metal  bodies is  not allowed for new construction due to the possibility of a cold weld with inadequate strength. (T-0). 14.4.4.  The  metal  framework  of  a  structure  shall  be  permitted  to  be  utilized  as  an  air terminal  and main conductor of a lightning protection system  if it is  equal  to  or  greater than 3⁄16 (0.188) inch (4.8 millimeters) in thickness and is electrically continuous, either inherently or made. (T-0). 14.5.  Explosives  Facility  with  Large  Perimeter.  New  explosives  facilities  with  a perimeter  over  300  feet  (91.4  meters)  that  require  lightning  protection  and  do  not  use  the structural  steel  as  an  air  terminal  equivalent  shall  use  either  a  mast  system  or  an  overhead wire  system.  See  Attachment  4  for  requirements.  Such  indirect  air  terminal  designs  are intended  to  provide  lightning  attachment  away  from  the  facility  and  not  directly  to  the facility.  It  also  reduces  maintenance  and  installation  costs.  The  BCE  may  waive  this requirement  (overhead  or  mast  system).  ECMs  are  not  required  to  carry  air  terminals  from headwall to headwall (for drive-through ECMs) or from headwall to air vent. (T-2). 28 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 Figure 3.  ECM With Center Conductor and Air Terminals.  AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 29 Figure 4.  ECM Without Center Conductor and Air Terminals.  30 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 14.6.  Sunshades.  The  metal  framework  of  a  sunshade  structure  shall  be  permitted  to  be utilized as an air terminal  and main  conductor of a lightning protection system if structural members  are  equal  to  or  greater  than  3⁄16  (0.188)  inch  (4.8  millimeters)  in  thickness  and structural  members  are  electrically  continuous  (either  inherent  or  made)  to  ground. Grounding  requirements  depend  upon  the  footing  of  the  vertical  support  units  (columns). Vertical  support  units  with  full  footers  require  no  further  grounding.  The  flight  line  (to include sunshade areas) is evacuated once lightning is at a distance (in nautical miles [NM]) determined  by  the  base;  therefore,  step  potential  is  not  considered  for  sunshades.  Vertical support  units  bolted  to  the  apron  concrete  make  it  necessary  to,  as  a  minimum,  install  one grounding  electrode  at  two  diagonally  opposite  corners.  Roof  material,  whether  metallic  or fabric,  is  of  no  consequence  when  considering  the  steel  structure  as  a  lightning  protection system. 14.7.  Protective  Aircraft  Shelters  (PAS)  (also  known  as  Hardened  Aircraft  Shelter [HAS]).  Aircraft shelters with continuous interior steel arches, either visible or validated by record  drawings,  provides  a  Faraday-like  shield  and  therefore  requires  no  air  terminals. Exterior metallic ventilators with an enclosure at least 3/16 (0.188) inch (4.8 millimeters) in thickness do not require air terminals if properly bonded to the steel arch. Metallic ventilators less than 3/16 (0.188) inch (4.8 mm) in thickness must be protected by an air terminal bonded to  the steel  arch in  accordance with  NFPA 780. All  metal  bodies mounted to  the steel  arch shall be bonded and grounded in accordance with this instruction and NFPA 780. The facility grounding system shall  also  comply  with  this instruction and NFPA 780. Since the  floor is designed to be separable from the walls, the walls and the floor shall be permanently bonded to  a  single  grounding  point  or  series  of  connected  grounding  points  identified  on  record drawings. If no record drawings are available, continuity shall be validated by a minimum of four shell-to-ground tests interior to the facility. A sketch will be made, indicating test points, and  this  shall  become  the  record  drawing.  Visual  inspection  will  be  conducted  every  12 months and testing will be conducted every 24 months. (T-0). 15.  Surge Protection.  Surge protection is required on electrical service entrances and on some interior  distribution  panels  in  accordance  with  NFPA  780.  (T-0).  SPD,  formerly  referred  to  as TVSS (transient voltage surge suppression), protect facilities and facility contents from transient voltages  resulting  from  lightning  surges,  switching  surges,  and  surges  internal  to  the  facility caused  by  mechanical  and  user-owned  electronic  devices  and  equipment,  and  may  protect  the upstream  distribution  system  from  the  rapid  switching  effects  of  user-owned  electronics.  For large  facilities,  SPDs  are  most  effective  when  used  in  the  form  of  tiered  protection.  Tiered protection  means  providing  protection  at  main  distribution  panels,  at  secondary  or  sub-panels, and at the equipment point of use. For protection of non-real property installed equipment, refer to  the  equipment  manufacturers’  requirements  for  surge  protection  (the  equipment  users  fund purchase, installation and maintenance of any surge protective devices required for the protection of  communications  and  other  equipment  or  desired  by  the  user  for  additional  protection  of communications and other equipment). In facilities such as dormitories and other facilities with basic/minimal electronics, low-dollar contents, and/or minimal occupants, surge protection may meet the requirement for a lightning protection system.   AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 31 15.1.  WSAs, MSAs, and Communications Facilities: 15.1.1.  Standard,  published,  minimum  10-year  unlimited  replacement  warranty  on product  (SPD).  The  entire  unit  shall  be  replaced  upon  detection  of  the  failure  of  any mode. (T-1). 15.1.2.  All  mode  (10  modes),  directly  connected  protection  elements  (l-n,  l-g,  l-l,  n-g). Direct clamping l-n and l-l is required. (T-1). 15.1.3.  F1  polycarbonate  enclosure  or  NEMA  4  or  4X  steel  enclosure:  Inaccessible  to unqualified persons. (T-1). 15.1.4.  Internal  over-current  fusing  on  each  phase  for  self-protection  from  failed component(s) and an internal disconnect for each phase. (T-1). 15.1.5.  Individual component level thermal fusing. (T-1). 15.1.6.  Bi-polar protection. (T-1). 15.1.7.  The  SPD  shall  contain  continuous  self-monitoring  devices  with  indicator  lamps for  each  mode.  (T-1).  These  may  be  located  inside  enclosed  areas  such  as  mechanical rooms  if  an  indicator  lamp  is  provided  in  a  visible  area.  It  would  be  preferable  for  the indicator  lamp  to  be  installed  in  a  location  that  can  be  seen  from  a  vehicle,  allowing maintenance personnel to drive through large areas and quickly identify devices that have operated.  Indicator  lamps  that  can  be  seen  in  this  way  will  also  allow  maintenance personnel to assess whether a group of SPDs in a single area have operated. 15.1.8.  Cable  connection  between  a  bus  and  SPD  shall  be  minimum  No.  10  AWG  for installation at main distribution panels and sub-panels. (T-1). 15.2.  Igloos or ECMs:  Up to 60A service. 15.2.1.  Visible indicators of SPD operation on the exterior of facilities. Drive-by visual inspections may be an effective means of inspecting SPDs. 15.2.2.  60kA/mode to allow the following requirement. 15.2.3.  180kA/phase peak service surge current. 15.2.4.  Non-modular.  The  entire  unit  shall  be  replaced  upon  detection  of  the  failure  of one  mode  of  operation.

Types  of  Grounds.  There  are  five  basic  types  of  grounding  systems  which  must  be inspected  if  present  in  a  facility:  static  grounds,  equipment  grounds,  electrical  system  grounds, lightning grounds (down conductors), and signal reference grounds. (T-0). Subsystem grounds is a hybrid of these five basic systems. A2.1.1.  Static Grounds.  A static ground is a connection between a piece of equipment and earth to drain off static electricity charges before they reach a sparking (discharge) potential. Typically,  static  grounding  involves  connecting  large  metal  objects  such  as  fuel  tanks  or aircraft  to  earth  through  a  grounding  electrode.  Static  grounds  are  not  part  of  an  electrical power system, but  if an  equipment  grounding  conductor is  adequate for  power circuits it is also adequate for static grounding. involves interconnecting  and A2.1.2.  Equipment  Grounds.  Equipment  grounding connecting  to  earth  all  non-current-carrying  metal  parts  of  an  electrical  wiring  system  and equipment  connected  to  the  system.  The  purpose  of  grounding  equipment  is  to  ensure personnel safety by reducing any residual charge in an equipment item to near zero volts with respect to  ground. An equipment ground must be capable of carrying the maximum ground fault  current  possible  without  causing  a  fire  or  explosive  hazard  until  the  circuit  protective device  clears  the  fault.  An  example  is  the  bare  copper  wire  or  green  insulated  conductor connected to the frames of electric motors, breaker panels, and outlet boxes. The equipment ground  is  connected  to  an  electrical  system  ground  (neutral)  only  at  the  electrical  service entrance of a building. A2.1.3.  Electrical  System  Ground  (Single  Point  Facility  Ground).  The  purpose  of electrical system grounds is to limit the voltage imposed by lightning, line/switching surges, or unintentional contact with higher-voltage lines and to stabilize the voltage to earth during normal operation. See NEC Article 250.4(A)(1). One wire or point of an electrical circuit in an electrical system ground is connected to earth. This connection is usually at the electrical neutral  (though  not  always),  and  is  called  the  "system  ground"  or  “single  point  facility ground.”  The  resistance  of  most  electrical  system  ground  electrodes  operating  at  or  below 600 Vac should not be more than 25 ohms. Medium voltage systems (1 to 15kV) frequently are  grounded  through  a  resistor  (or  reactor)  and  may  exceed  25  ohms.  This  practice  limits ground  fault  current  to  a  manageable  level.  If  a  ground  loop  conductor  functions  as  the electrical system ground (single point facility ground) then 25 ohms is not a requirement. A2.1.4.  Lightning  Grounds  or  Down  Conductors.  The purpose of  a lightning protection system is to provide for the safeguarding of persons and  property from  hazards arising from exposure  to  lightning.    Grounds  and  down  conductors  are  necessary  to  safely  dissipate lightning  strokes  into  the  earth.  They  are  part  of  a  lightning  protection  system  that  usually includes air terminals (lightning rods), main size conductors, arrestors, and other connectors or fittings required for a complete system. It is helpful to provide test wells for access to the grounding electrodes to test for continuity to the down conductor. 40 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 Figure A2.1.  Test Well Configuration Example.  A2.1.5.  Signal Reference Grounds.  The purpose of a signal reference ground is to provide a  low  impedance  reference  system  for  electronic  equipment  to  minimize  noise-induced voltages (distortions on the voltage waveform) and thereby reduce equipment malfunctions. Common configurations include planes and grids. See IEEE STD 1100-1999 Recommended Practice for Powering and Grounding Electronic Equipment, for details. With the exception of  the  connection  point  to  the  facility  grounding  system,  the  responsibility  for  individual signal reference ground testing lies with the equipment owners. A2.1.6.  Subsystem  Grounds.  Each  of  the  grounding  systems  described  above  may  be  a subsystem of a total facility grounding system. All grounds (and subsystems) must be bonded together  according  to  NFPA  780  and  the  NEC.  The  electrical  system  ground  (single  point facility  ground)  is  the  master  ground  and  all  must  be  tied  to  that  point,  either  directly  or indirectly.  (T-0).  Testing  of  equipment  grounds  is  the  responsibility  of  the  equipment owners. A2.2.  NEC Grounding Requirements.  Electrical systems and circuit conductors are grounded to  limit  voltages  during  lightning  and  to  facilitate  overcurrent  device  operation  in  case  of  a ground fault. The NEC allows the system neutral to be grounded and limits the location of this neutral  (NEC  Article  250-24  and  Exhibit  250.1).  Since  the  neutral  will  carry  current  under normal operating conditions, the NEC refers to it as the grounded conductor. See NEC Article 250. A2.2.1.  Facility Ground.  The NEC requires a premises wiring system to have a grounding electrode at each service. This electrode may be of several different types or systems. Each of the types listed below must be bonded together to form the grounding electrode system.  (T-0). A2.2.1.1.  Where a metal underground water pipe (uncoated) is in direct contact with the earth  for  10  feet  (3.05  meters)  or  more,  do  not  bond  around  insulation  flanges  installed AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 41 for  cathodic  protection.  If  the  underground  water  pipe  is  the  only  electrode  available, grounding electrodes must supplement it. A2.2.1.2.  The metal frame of a building where the building is effectively grounded. A2.2.1.3.  An electrode encased by at least 2 inches (51 millimeters) of concrete, made of at least 20 feet (6.1 meters) of one or more steel reinforcing bars, located within and near the  bottom  of  a  concrete  foundation  or  footing  in  direct  contact  with  the  earth.  This  is known as a Ufer ground. A2.2.1.4.  A ground ring encircling the building at least 2.5 feet (0.76 meters) deep. The ground ring must be at least 20 feet (6.1 meters) long and use at least AWG No. 2 copper (for  lightning  protection  ground  ring  conductor,  see  paragraph  A4.1.16  below).  (T-0). Where  none  of  the  above-listed  electrodes  are  present,  grounding  electrodes  or  ground plates must be used. (T-0). Grounding electrodes must be at least 8 feet (2.44 meters) in length  (10  feet  [3.05  meters]  for  lightning  protection;  see  paragraph  A4.1.11).  (T-0). Grounding electrodes or plates must not be aluminum. (T-0). The Air Force discourages the  use  of  stainless  steel  grounding  electrodes  because  of  the  cost;  however,  if justification is provided, use is allowed. A2.2.2.  Separately  Derived  System  (SDS).  A  separately  derived  system  is  an  electrical source, other than a service, having no direct connection(s) to circuit conductors of any other electrical  source  other  than  those  established  by  grounding  and  bonding  connections. Examples of SDSs include generators, batteries, converter windings, transformers, and solar photovoltaic  systems,  provided  they  have  no  direct  electrical  connection  to  another  source. The grounded circuit conductors are not intended to be directly connected (Article 100). A2.2.2.1.  Dry  type  transformers  (isolation  and  non-isolation)  are  common  sources  of SDSs  in  a  facility.  Typically,  they  are  connected  in  a  delta-wye  configuration.  SDS transformers  are  widely  used  in  sensitive  electronic  installations  (computer  power distribution  centers  are  essentially  SDS  transformers)  since  they  effectively  establish  a local  ground  at  the  electronic  equipment.  This  minimizes  the  impedance  to  ground  as seen by the load. They should always possess a means of vibration isolation. A2.2.2.2.  Standby  or  emergency  generators  are  also  common  sources  of  separately derived  systems.  A  generator  connected  to  a  facility  through  a  transfer  switch  is  not  a separately  derived  system  if  the  neutral  conductor  remains  connected  to  the  normal commercial power source neutral after transfer (the neutral is not switched along with the phase conductors). AFI 32-1062, Electrical Power Systems, requires a switched neutral in the case of all real property installed equipment (RPIE) generators (4-pole generators and automatic  transfer  switches).  For  older  generators  without  a  switched  neutral,  the required  connection  of  the  neutral  to  the  facility’s  grounding  electrode  system  for  both the commercial power source and the generator must be made only on the supply side of the  commercial  power  service  disconnect.  (T-0).  Providing  an  additional  connection between  the  generator  neutral  and  a  grounding  electrode  at  the  generator  would  be  a grounding  connection  on  the  load  side  of  the  service  disconnect  and  a  violation  of  the NEC. Refer to  IEEE Standard 446,  Recommended Practice for Emergency and Standby Power  (The  Orange  Book),  for  additional  information  and  requirements  on  grounding emergency and standby generators. 42 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 A2.3.  Grounding Electrodes. A2.3.1.  Connection to Earth.  The most practical method of connecting to earth is to bury a solid body, such as a metal rod, pipe, or sheet, and connect a grounding conductor to it. This solid body is known as a grounding electrode. A2.3.2.  Methods for Obtaining Better Grounds.  Frequently a satisfactorily low electrode resistance cannot be obtained because of high soil resistivity. Use the following methods if it is necessary to lower the resistance of the electrode. A2.3.2.1.  Deeper  Grounding  Electrode  (Ground  Rod).  As  a  grounding  electrode  is driven more deeply into the soil, it not only has more surface contact with the earth but it also begins to reach soil which is more conductive. The deeper the electrode, the less the effect of poor surface moisture content and temperature changes. A2.3.2.2.  Parallel Grounding Electrodes.  Grounding electrodes driven parallel to each other should have space between them at least the length of the electrodes unless only a few additional ohms are required to obtain 25 ohms. In that case, the additional electrode may  need  to  be  only  a  few  feet  from  the  first  driven  electrode.  To  determine  necessary distance  prior  to  permanently  placing  the  second  ground  rod,  partially  drive  the  ground rod,  attach  a  temporary  bond  between  the  two,  and  re-measure  the  resistance  of  the combination.  If 25 ohms is achieved, remove the temporary bond, drive the ground rod in  place  and  permanently  bond  the  two  together.    Multiple  electrodes  connected  by  a conductor have a greater ability to equalize potential over the installation area. AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 43 Figure A2.2.  Parallel Grounding Electrodes at Service Entrances (Also See NEC Minimums).  A2.3.2.3.  Soil  Replacement.  You can significantly lower the resistance of a grounding electrode by lowering the resistivity of the soil immediately surrounding it. Use a mixture of  75  percent  gypsum,  20  percent  bentonite  (well  driller’s  mud),  and  5  percent  sodium sulfate.  This  mixture  is  available  from  cathodic  protection  supply  companies.  The mixture is better than chemical salts because it lasts much longer and chemical salts may not  be  compatible  with  environmental  requirements.  Various  vendors  provide  low-resistance  backfills  that  may  be  approved  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  In  all  instances, indication should be less than 5 percent sulphur content. 44 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 A2.3.2.4.  Concrete  Encapsulation.  Encapsulating  grounding  electrodes  with  concrete increases  their  effective  diameter.  The  concrete  absorbs  water  from  the  soil,  increasing the conductivity directly around the electrode. A2.3.2.5.  Other  Methods.  Other  more-elaborate  methods  include  installation  of  a ground loop conductor, electrode networks, or multiple electrodes laid horizontally both parallel  and  perpendicular,  and  bonded  together  to  create  a  grid  about  18  inches  (0.5 meter) below the surface. Figure A2.3.  Sample Grid of Bonded Horizontally Laid Grounding Electrodes.  A2.4.  Grounding  and  Corrosion.  Copper  grounding  has  been  the  standard  of  the  electrical industry  almost  from  inception.  Because  copper  is  cathodic  to  all  common  construction materials,  corrosion  often  results  when  copper  is  in  contact  with  ferrous  structures.  Bonding underground  ferrous  structures  to  copper  grounding  systems  can  create  serious  corrosion problems. A2.4.1.  Corrosion of Pipelines.  A typical situation for corrosion development exists when a facility’s copper grounding system is bonded to a coated steel pipeline entering the facility. If  this  pipe  is  installed  in  low-resistivity  soil,  corrosion  current  will  be  high  because  of  the potential between copper and steel, the low-resistance circuit, and concentrated at the voids (holidays) in the pipe coating. Common solutions to this problem are use of galvanized steel rather than copper grounding electrodes, installing an insulating fitting above the ground in the  pipeline  where  it  exits  the  soil  and  as  it  enters  the  building,  separating  the  grounding system and the piping systems as widely as possible, installing a sacrificial anode system, or some combination of these solutions. Note that while the aboveground portion of the pipeline is grounded for safety, the underground portion is already grounded by contact with the soil. The resistance to earth of a typical coated piping system is usually 1 to 5 ohms. A2.4.2.  Hazardous  Voltages.  If  insulating  fittings  are  installed  on  a  pipeline,  take precautions  against  lightning  flashover  at  the  fittings  or  a  dangerous  potential  difference between  the  pipe  sections.  Connect  a  metal  oxide  varistor  (MOV)  lightning  arrestor,  zinc grounding  cell,  or  an  electrolytic  cell  across  the  insulating  device.  The  clamping  voltage should be 3.14 times the maximum output voltage of the rectifier of the cathodic protection system. A2.4.3.  Zinc  Grounding Cell.  A zinc grounding cell is made of two bars of 1.4 by 1.4 by 60-inch  (3.55  by  3.55  by  152.4-centimeter)  zinc  separated  by  1-inch  (2.54-centimeter) spacers. Each bar has an insulated AWG No. 6 stranded copper conductor silver-brazed to a 0.25-inch (0.64-centimeter) -diameter steel core rod. The unit comes prepackaged in a bag of AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 45 low-resistivity backfill (75 percent gypsum, 20 percent bentonite, 5 percent sodium sulfate). The nominal resistance of a two-anode grounding cell is 0.4 ohm. For lower resistance, a four cross-connected zinc anode cell with a resistance of 0.2 ohm is available. This resistance acts as an open circuit to the low dc voltage corrosion current, but like a short to lightning or 120 Vac commercial current. A2.4.4.  Electrolytic  Cell.  An  electrolytic  cell  (Kirk  Cell)  consists  of  multiple  pairs  of stainless steel plates immersed in a potassium hydroxide electrolyte solution with an oil film floating on top to prevent evaporation. The cell acts like an electrochemical switch, blocking low dc voltages in the cathodic protection range, but instantaneously shunting ac or higher dc voltages to ground.  46 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 Attachment 3 BASIC BONDING REQUIREMENTS A3.1.  Basic Requirements.  Three conditions or situations establish the requirement for a bond. Condition 1 Common bonding of grounded systems – structures exceeding 60 ft (18 m)  Condition 2 Condition 3 Isolated (ungrounded)  metallic bodies (such as metallic window frames) Bonding of metal bodies (See definition for “structure.”) A. Structures 40 ft (12.2 m) and less B. Structures more than  40 ft ( 12.2 m) in height where bonding is required within  60 ft  ( 18.3  m) from top of structure A3.2.  Condition 1. A3.2.1.  Effective  with  the  2017  NFPA  780,  for  metal  or  steel-framed  structures  exceeding 60  feet  (18  meters)  in  height,  the  interconnection  of  the  lightning  protection  system grounding  electrodes  and  other  grounded  media  shall  be  in  the  form  of  a  ground  loop conductor.  (T-0).  This  interconnection  shall  include  all  building  grounding  electrode systems,  including  lightning  protection,  electrical  service,  communications  service,  and antenna  systems  grounding  electrodes.  For  existing  metal  or  steel-framed  structures exceeding  60  feet  (18  meters),  metal  bodies  must  be  bonded  as  near  as  practical  at  their extremities (top and bottom) to structural steel members. A3.2.2.  For  reinforced  concrete  structures  where  the  reinforcement  is  interconnected  and grounded,  long,  vertical  metal  bodies  must  be  bonded  to  the  lightning  protection  system down  conductors  (unless  inherently  bonded  through  construction)  at  their  extremities  (top and bottom). (T-0). A3.3.  Condition  2.  Bonding  of  metal  bodies  not  covered  by  Condition  1  (structure  is  </=  60 feet  [18  meters]).  Grounded  metal  bodies  shall  be  bonded  to  the  lightning  protection  system where  located  within  a  calculated  bonding  distance,  D,  as  determined  by  the  following  basic bonding formula (BBF):      (T-0).  Where: D = calculated bonding distance h = either the height of the building or the vertical distance from the nearest bonding connection from  the  grounded  metal  body  to  the  lightning  protection  system  and  the  point  on  the  down conductor where the bonding connection is being considered n = value related to the number of down conductors that are spaced at least 25 feet (7.6 meters) apart and located within a zone of 100 feet (30 meters) from the bond in question Km = 1 if the flashover is through air; 0.50 if through dense material such as concrete, brick, and wood   AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 47 The value n shall be calculated as follows: n = 1 where there is one down conductor in this zone; n = 1.5 where there are two down conductors in this zone; n = 2.25 where there are three or more down  conductors  in  this  zone.  Application  of  this  general  formula  is  adjusted  below,  based  on structure height. For quick reference, some calculated values for a single down conductor (n) are shown below: Exterior. For items mounted on the exterior of a building on the same building face as a down conductor or another part of the LPS, where Km = 1.0 (air): Common calculations: At h=60 inches, D=10 inches At h=42 inches, D= 7 inches At h=18 feet, D=3 feet At h= 20 feet, D=3 feet, 4 inches Note  that  no  masts  or  metal  objects  are  allowed  within  6  feet  (1.8  meters)  of  the  base  of  a building exterior wall, to provide a safe side flash distance and adequate work space at the base of a mast. See Figure A4.1. Interior.  For  metal  items  on  the  interior  of  a  building  where  Km  =  0.5  (some  solid  medium previously described): At  h=42  inches,  D=3.5  inches,  but  6  inches  is  minimum  distance;  therefore  D=6  inches.  This applies  to  static  bus  bars  installed  on  the  interior  of  an  exterior  wall.  No  metal  objects  are allowed closer than 6 inches to  the static bus bar (examples are metallic lockers, metallic tool boxes and similar items). At h=60 inches, D=5 inches, but, again, 6 inches is minimum distance; therefore, D=6 inches. A3.3.1.  Condition 2a. For grounded metal bodies inside structures 40 feet (12.2 meters) and less in  height. Grounded metal bodies shall be bonded to the lightning protection system where located within a calculated bonding distance (side flash distance), D, as determined by the following formula: (T-0).  Where: D = calculated bonding distance h = either the height of the building or the vertical distance from the nearest bonding connection from  the  grounded  metal  body  to  the  lightning  protection  system  and  the  point  on  the  down conductor where the bonding connection is being considered n = value related to the number of down conductors that are spaced at least 25 feet (7.6 meters) apart and located within a zone of 100 feet (30 meters) from the bond in question Km = 1 if the flashover is through air; Km = 0.50 if through dense material such as concrete, brick, and wood. The value n shall be calculated as: n=1 where only one down conductor is within 100 feet, n=1.5 where  two  down  conductors  are  within  100  feet,  and  n=2.25  where  three  or  more  down conductors are within 100 feet.   48 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 Down  conductors  not  separated  by  at  least  25  feet  (7.6  meters)  are  considered  one  down conductor and n=1.  An  example  of this calculation is shown in Figure A3.1.  The height of the building  is  35  feet  (10.7  meters).  A  is  a  metal  pipe  grounded  at  one  end  but  close  to  down conductor. B is the only down conductor within 100 feet (30.5 meters) of the point in question, so n =  1.  Since  any  flashover  would  occur  through  the  wall,  Km  =  0.5.  The  BBF  is  D  = [h/6(1)](0.5)  =  (30 feet/6)(0.5)  = (5.0)(0.5) = 2.5 feet (0.76 meter). This means that if pipe A is 2.5  feet  (0.76  meter)  or  closer  to  the  down  conductor  at  the  point  in  question  (30  feet  [9.14 meters] in height), bond it through  the wall to the down conductor. If installed within side flash distance,  the  design  should  relocate  either  the  down  conductor  or  offset  the  installation  of  the metallic object, pipe A, in this case. A3.3.2.  Condition 2b For grounded metal bodies inside structures more than 40 feet (12.2 meters) in height and where the bond in question is within 60 feet (18.3 meters) from the top of  the structure, the following definitions apply.  D = calculated bonding distance h = vertical distance between the bond under consideration and the nearest interconnection to the lightning protection system or ground n = value related to the number of down conductors that are spaced at least 25 feet (7.6 meters) apart and located within a zone of 100 feet (30 meters) from the bond in question K  m  =  1  if  the  flashover  is  through  air;  Km  =  0.50  if  through  dense  material  such  as  concrete, brick, and wood. The value n shall be  calculated as:  n=1 where only one down  conductor is  within 100 feet  (30 meters), n=1.5 where two down conductors are within 100 feet, and n=2.25 where three or more down conductors are within 100 feet (30 meters). Where bonding is required below a level 60 feet (18 meters) from the top of a structure, n shall be the total number of down conductors in the lightning protection system. Figure A3.2 shows bond fitting Condition 2b(1).  The vertical height, h1, is 75 feet (22.9 meters). In  this  case, the two down  conductors  are  within  100  feet  (30  meters)  of the  bond  at  D1,  and  n equals 1.5.  Again,  the flashover would be through the wall, so Km = 0.5. The BBF is D1 =  ([75 /(6)(1.5)])0.5 = (75/9)(0.5) = 4.17 feet (1.27 meters). If pipe A is 4.17 feet (1.27) meters or closer to  the down conductor, bond it to  the down conductor through the wall. If installed within side flash distance, the design should relocate either the down conductor or offset the installation of the metallic object if possible, pipe A, in this case.   AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 49 A3.3.3.  Condition 2c For grounded metal bodies where the bond in question is below the  top 60 feet (18.3 meters) of a structure which is greater than 40 feet (12.2 meters) in height,  the  following definitions apply. h  =  the  vertical  distance  between  the  bond  being  considered  and  the  nearest  other  lightning protection system bond (or to ground level if no other bond is present). n = the total number of down conductors (spaced 7.6 m apart) in the lightning protection  system. This type of bond is shown in Figure A3.2.  Pipe B comes close to a down conductor at a height below the top  60 feet (18.3 meters) of the structure.  Km would be 0.5 for a flash through the wall and  n  would  be  the  total  number  of  down  conductors  for  the  system  (assume  four).  The  BBF would be  D2 = ([35/6(4)])0.5 = (35/24)(0.5) = 0.73 foot (0.22 meter).  The pipe B would have to be  bonded through the wall to the down conductor at this location if it is 0.73 foot (0.22 meter) or closer  to  the  conductor.  For  this  example,  a  wall  thickness  of  8.8  inches  would  not  require through-the-wall  bonding.  If  installed  within  side  flash  distance,  the  design  should  relocate either the down conductor or offset the installation of the metallic object, pipe B, in this case. Note that for buildings  between 40 and 60 feet (12.2 and 18.3 meters) in height, Condition 2b(1) would apply. A3.3.4.  Side Flash for Catenary Systems. For  catenary  systems,  it  is  necessary  to  calculate  the  distance  of  the  cable  sag  of  the  cross conductor to the nearest part of the facility or the position of the cross conductor that is nearest to any metal item mounted on top of the facility. The BBF must be used for this, but in no case shall the lowest part of the sag be less than 6 feet (1.8 meters) from the nearest part of the facility. (T-0). See Figure A4.1. For a metal mast or pole, h = the horizontal distance at the lowest point of sag to the top of the metal pole or mast. For a non-metal mast or pole, h = the horizontal distance at the lowest point of sag to the top of the  non-metal  mast  or  pole  plus  the  vertical  distance  from  the  top  of  the  mast  or  pole  to  the grounding point at its base.  50 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 Figure A3.1.  Typical Bonding Conditions in Structures 40 Feet or Less in Height.  AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 51 Figure A3.2.  Typical Bonding Conditions in Structures Greater Than 40 Feet in height. [D2 cut off]  A3.4.  Condition 3.  Bonding of ungrounded metal bodies positioned to effectively short part of the  separation  distance  between  a  grounded  metal  body  and  a  lightning  conductor.  In  Figure A3.3,  a  window  is  located  between  a  grounded  metal  body  and  a  lightning  protection  down conductor. First, calculate the bonding distance between the grounded body and down conductor by  using  the  BBF  according  to  the  correct  condition  [2a,  2b(1),  or  2b(2)].  This  will  provide  a distance for D. If the distance a + b is less than or equal to D, then the down conductor must be bonded directly to the grounded metal body. Note the window itself does not have to be bonded. Continuity tests should be performed to determine if the object is grounded, and not ungrounded, as it may appear. 52 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 Figure A3.3.  Typical Bonding Conditions for Ungrounded Metal Bodies.  A3.5.  Typical Air Force Situation.  Figure A3.4 depicts a situation that typically occurs at Air Force bases. Boxes shown in Figures A3.4 and A3.6 represent various types of metallic electrical enclosures.  These  are  required  by  the  NEC  to  be  grounded,  and  therefore  constitute  grounded metal  bodies  as  defined  by  Condition  2  above.  They  would  have  to  be  bonded  to  the  down conductor  if  separation  from  the  down  conductor  is  less  than  the  distance  determined  by  the BBF, Condition 2. Condition 3 would not apply between the door frame and the down conductor with objects 1 through 4 in between, because all are grounded. However, the BBF, Condition 2, has to be applied between the down conductor and the doorframe. On explosives facilities where such  objects  do  not  need  to  be  bonded,  recommend  they  be  marked  or  labeled  "NBN"  (No Bonding Needed) for future reference. Figure A3.4.

Explosives  Facility  Bonding.  The  following  supplements  the  NFPA  780  bonding requirements for explosives facilities defined in Chapter 3. A3.6.1.  Figure A3.7 provides approximate bonding distances as defined by NFPA 780. Note that  this  chart  does  not  cover  Condition  2b(2).  The  terms  h,  Km,  and  n  are  defined  in paragraph  A3.3.1.  To  demonstrate  the  use  of  the  chart,  it  is  used  to  solve  the  example  in paragraph A3.3.1.  54 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 Figure A3.7.  Sample Calculations of Bonding Distances.

Find the height (h) (9.15 m) in the column labeled h. 2. Then select the row adjacent to the 9.15 m where Km is 0.5, since any flashover would occur  through the wall. 3. Since there is only one down conductor, n equals 1.  Find the intersection of the row selected  in  step 2 and the column labeled 1.0.  The value in the cell is 0.76 m.  Therefore, D is 0.76 m or 2 ft 6 in. Also notice that the greatest bonding distance for objects not covered by 2b(2) inside a facility  less than 12.2 m in height is 1.01 m (3 ft 4 in). This table derived from NFPA 780 A3.6.2.  Steel magazine doors inherently in physical contact with the metallic door frame do not  need  a  separate  bond  if  the  resistance  between  the  door  and  frame  measures  1  ohm  or less.  Install  a  bonding  strap  if  this  resistance  between  the  door  and  frame  measures  greater than 1 ohm. The frame must be inherently grounded through the rebar or bonded to a down conductor. A3.6.3.  Objects such as metal desks, metal lockers, large metal trash cans, and ground-level floor grates do not need to be bonded unless they are located within side flash distance of a component of the lightning protection system or a static bus bar.   AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 55 A3.6.4.  Fence  posts  and  railroad  tracks  within  6  feet  (1.83  meters)  of  any  component  of  a structure’s  lightning  protection  system  must  be  bonded  either  to  the  structure’s  grounding system or to a ground rod which is bonded to the structure’s grounding system.  In addition, fence  posts  at  gates  where  either  personnel  or  explosives  equipment  may  pass  must  be grounded. These are test points. A3.6.5.  Blast  valves  must  be  inherently  grounded  through  the  rebar  system  or  with  a separate bonding strap. A3.6.6.  Metal  bodies  located  within  a  steel-framed  structure  that  are  inherently  bonded  to the  structure  through  construction  must  be  tested  when  the  facility  is  new  and  the measurements  recorded  and  kept  with  the  other  required  measurements  and  observations. They do not need to be tested again unless there is reason to believe the bond has changed, e.g., corrosion or structural repair. A3.7.  Protective  Aircraft  Shelters  (PAS).  In  PASs  with  interior  steel  arches,  all  grounded metal bodies within 1 foot (0.305 meter) of the steel arch must be bonded to the arch. In PASs without  a  steel  arch,  all  grounded  metal  masses  within  1  foot  (0.305  meter)  of  a  wall  must  be bonded to the nearest metallic electrical  conduit if not already connected. Only those grounded metal  bodies  not  inherently  bonded  (through  metallic  conduit  or  equipment  grounding conductor) must be tested for continuity to the ground or conduit system. All metal doors must be grounded. Door hinges and door tracks are acceptable as a bonding strap if the doorframe or door  track  is  grounded  and  there  is  less  than  1  ohm  between  the  door  and  ground.  Additional requirements for PASs with WS3 vaults are as follows: A3.7.1.  Continuity  between  the  steel  arch  and  grounding  system  may  be  measured  by validating with an ohmmeter the continuity between the steel arch and any metallic electrical conduit.  Two  test  points  between  different  conduits  and  the  arch  are  sufficient  if  the  test points  are  spaced  on  opposite  walls  and  the  conduit  long.  This  is  to  ensure  electrical continuity  through  the  structural  shell.  If  a  maximum  of  1  ohm  is  not  achieved,  a  bonding strap must be installed. A3.7.2.  When  testing  continuity  between  the  WS3  vault  and  steel  arch,  an  acceptable  test location is the vault lip or flange flush with the shelter floor. The vault does not have to be raised. Where there is no steel arch, test from a metallic electrical conduit on the PAS wall to the vault lip.  56 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 Attachment 4 LIGHTNING PROTECTION SYSTEMS A4.1.  Minimum  Requirements.  Engineers  assigned  specific  responsibilities  for  lightning protection must review the lightning protection system on each facility at least annually or after repair actions have been completed. (T-0). A4.1.1.  Air  terminals  must  extend  at  least  10  inches  (0.25  meter)  above  the  object  to  be protected. (T-0).  Consider the use of blunt-tipped air terminals  for new system installations on  Air  Force  installations.  (T-0).  Note:  When  replacing  air  terminals  with  terminals  of  a different length, required spacing around the perimeter must be reconfirmed and the zone of protection  verified.    Figure  4.8.2.4(b)  1:1  zone  of  protection  in  NFPA  780  should  extend from the tip of the air terminal instead of the eave. A4.1.2.  Each air terminal mounted separately from the facility (non-integral system) (except as  exempted  in  NFPA  780)  must  have  at  least  two  paths  to  ground.  (T-0).  For  a  catenary system  consisting  of  non-metallic  poles  or  masts,  the  second  path  may  be  one  of  the  cross conductors  to  the  next  pole  or  mast.  For  a  metallic  mast,  the  base  must  be  bonded  to  two separate grounding electrodes, as far apart as possible (opposite sides of the mast is the goal). Note that for earth-covered igloos, these paths may be covered with soil. A4.1.3.  Each building with an integral protection system must have a minimum of two down conductors,  one  each  at  opposite  corners  (one  each  on  all  corners  is  preferred).  (T-0).  This provides  two  paths  to  ground.    Because  of  the  potential  for  galvanic  corrosion,  use  only aluminum lightning system conductors on metal roofs. (T-2). A4.1.4.  Down conductor design and installation must present the least possible impedance to ground. (T-0). A4.1.5.  Down conductors must not have sharp bends or loops. All bends must have a radius of bend not less than 8 inches (0.203 millimeters) and must measure not less than 90 degrees from the inside of the bend. (T-0). The 8-inch (203-millimeter) radius does not apply to "T" or "Y" splices. These splices, however, can be used only for the purpose intended. A4.1.6.  If the structure has metallic columns, these columns may serve as down conductors as  long  as  columns  do  not  average  more  than  a  60-foot  (18.3-meter)  separation  distance. Inherent bonding via continuity measurements must be shown on as-built drawings for new facilities.  (T-0).  If  not  shown  at  the  time  of  construction,  access  points  for  testing  must  be provided and validated prior to project acceptance. (T-0). A4.1.7.  Structures  must  have  at  least  two  down  conductors,  separated  as  widely  as practicable.  (T-0).  Diagonally  opposite  corner  locations  achieve  this  easily.  Structures exceeding 250 feet (76 meters) in perimeter shall have a down conductor for every 100 feet (30.5 meters) of perimeter or fraction thereof. (T-0). A4.1.8.  Any  down  conductors  subject  to  mechanical  damage  or  displacement  must  be protected with a protective molding or covering for a minimum of 6 feet (1.83 meters) above grade.  (T-0).  If  a  down  conductor  runs  through  a  ferrous  metal  tube  or  pipe  (usually  for mechanical  protection),  the  conductor  must  be  bonded  to  both  ends  of  the  tube  or  pipe  (at point of entry and exit). (T-0). AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 57 A4.1.9.  LPS components must not be painted, especially down conductor connectors. (T-0). Conductors  on  roofs  must  be  bare.  Oil-based  paints  may  result  in  fires  where  lightning impacts. Painting surfaces alter impedance characteristics. Painting contractors shall be made aware of this requirement. A4.1.10.  Each down conductor must be connected, at its base, to a grounding electrode or to a  ground  loop  conductor,  keeping  in  mind  the  bending  restrictions  of  the  down  conductor. (T-0).  A4.1.11.  Grounding  electrodes  must  be  at  least  10  ft.  (3.05  m)  long  and  made  of  not  less than  0.75-inch  (19.05-millimeter)  diameter  pipe  or  equivalent  solid  rod  made  of  copper  or copper-clad steel.  (T-0).    Stainless-steel  grounding  electrodes must not  be used. Grounding electrodes must be at least 3 feet (0.91 meters) from the building walls or footings and must penetrate  at  least  10  feet  (3.05  meters)  into  soil.  (T-0).    Grounding  electrodes  with  tops  at least  1  foot  (0.31  meter)  below  grade  are  recommended  for  mechanical  protection.  If conductors are not exothermically welded to the grounding electrode, test wells are required for new construction. (T-0).  A4.1.12.  The location of new down conductors on the exterior of a structure should take into consideration  interior  wall-mounted  objects  and  be  adjusted  to  avoid  them.  If  avoidance  is not  optional  or  for  existing  facilities,  interior  metal  parts  of  a  facility  close  to  a  down conductor will need to be bonded to that down conductor if within the calculated side flash distance. (T-0).  A4.1.13.  Bonding materials must be compatible with the metallic mass and down conductor. (T-0).  A4.1.14.  On  new  facilities,  down  conductors  entering  soil  with  less  than  10,000  ohm-cm resistivity must be protected against corrosion by a protective covering beginning 6 feet (1.83 meters) above finished grade. (T-0).  A4.1.15.  Adhesive fasteners for down conductors and cross conductors of an integral system are not allowed on Air Force facilities due to the short adherence life of the adhesive. A4.1.16.  A ground loop conductor (ground ring) encircling the building must be at least 1.5 feet  (0.46 meters) deep,  be at  least  20  feet  (6.1  meters) long and be a main-size conductor, sized from NFPA 780, Table 4.1.1.1.1 or 4.1.1.1.2)  (T-0).  A4.2.  Mast and Overhead Wire Systems. A4.2.1.  A mast-type lightning protection system uses masts located remote from the facility. The  mast  must  be  high  enough  to  enclose  the  facility  in  the  zone  of  protection  defined  by NFPA  780.  (T-0).  Separate  each  mast  from  any  part  of  the  facility  by  at  least  the  bonding distance specified in paragraph 4.6.5 of NFPA 780, but not less than 6 feet (1.83 meters). (T-0).  Refer to Figure A4.1. A4.2.2.  If a single mast will not protect a facility, install multiple masts or an overhead wire system.  An  overhead  wire  or  catenary  system  consists  of  grounded,  elevated,  horizontal metallic  wires  stretched  between  masts  surrounding  the  facility.  Each  wire  must  be  a continuous run of at least AWG No. 6 copper or equivalent. (T-0).  Suspend each wire above the  protected  facility  and  connect  them  to  grounding  electrodes  at  each  mast  or  pole. Interconnect all grounding electrodes with a ground loop conductor. NFPA 780, paragraphs 58 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 4.16.2.5  and  4.16.2.6,  specify  the  minimum  separation  between  the  overhead  wire  and  the protected facility, which must be at least equal to the bonding distance or side flash distance. (T-0).    A  minimum  of  6  feet  (1.83  meters)  is  recommended.  Supporting  masts  must  be separated by the side flash distance, but no less than 6 feet (1.83 meters). (T-0).  Figure A4.1.  Air Terminals on Masts (Typical). A4.2.3.  An air terminal extending above the top of the pole must be securely mounted to the top of the wooden mast and connected to the grounding system.  (T-0). An overhead ground wire or a down conductor, extending above or across the top of the pole, may serve as the air terminal  if  this  wire  or  conductor  is  the  topmost  item  on  the  mast.  Each  nonmetallic  mast must provide two paths to ground. A lone nonmetallic mast must have two down conductors. Metallic  masts  do  not  require  air  terminals  and  down  conductors,  but  must  have  two connections to the grounding system or to two grounding electrodes. (T-0).    AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 59 MAINTENANCE SELF-CHECK FOR EXPLOSIVES FACILITIES Attachment 5 A5.1.  Has each facility  been inspected to  determine the type of protection system installed?  Is the system mounted on the facility (integral) or separately mounted (mast or overhead system)? A5.2.  Are  maintenance  personnel  familiar  with  lightning  protection  systems?  See  paragraph  6 for personnel qualifications and training requirements. A5.3.  Are all maintenance personnel  who are qualified to  perform tests  or inspections familiar with  this  instruction?  Are  all  contractors  or  architect/engineers  for  large  contracts  within  the explosives area familiar with this instruction? A5.4.  Do  all  contracts  and  projects  (even  if  non-LPS)  on  facilities  with  LPS  require certification/recertification of the LPS and as-builts (if construction changes are made), prior to acceptance  and  payment  of  the  last  25  percent  of  the  contract  to  the  contractor  (this  includes SABER contracts)? This will ensure compliance with this instruction for new facilities and will ensure that no deficiencies have been introduced onto the existing LPS of existing facilities by a non-LPS contract. A5.5.  Are static grounding systems installed as separate subsystems? Are they connected only to a lightning protection system down conductor (when within side flash distance) or to  a  ground loop  conductor?  Are  contact  points  free  of  corrosion,  paint,  grease,  oil,  or  other  agents  that prevent good bonding? Are static bus bars bonded to the single point facility ground at each end? Note:  If  interior  static  bus  bars  cross  an  exterior  down  conductor  within  calculated  side  flash distance, relocate the down conductor or the static bus bar to avoid this crossing. See paragraph 13.2 of this instruction. A5.6.  Are  both  the  user  and  maintenance  personnel  aware  of  all  facilities  that  have  been identified  as  housing,  or  being  used  to  conduct,  hazardous  operations?  Are  personnel  familiar with any special test/inspection requirements? A5.7.  Are tests/inspections accomplished at the frequencies shown in Table 1 of this instruction? A5.8.  Are tests conducted with test instruments designed for the purpose used? A5.9.  Are  personnel  conducting  tests  familiar  with  the  location  and  designation  of  test  points and the relationship between various components of the system prior to testing? A5.10.  Are visual inspections being performed in accordance with Table 1 of this instruction? A5.11.  Are repair actions performed when reported? A5.12.  After  repair  actions  have  been  completed,  are  electrical  tests  accomplished  and documented, to ensure system integrity and records accuracy?  60 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 Attachment 6 TESTING REQUIREMENTS A6.1.  Grounding System Resistance Test.  Use the procedure described here or the procedure recommended by the test instrument manufacturer. (T-0).  Figure A6.1 illustrates auxiliary probe locations  for  fall-of-potential  ground  resistance  tests.  Where  possible,  conduct  this  test  at  the corner  of  the  building  opposite  the  electrical  service  entrance.  Exercise  caution:  underground metallic  piping  may  influence  readings.  Position  probes  as  far  as  possible  from  the  grounding system  under  test.  You  may  temporarily  disconnect  electrical  service  from  other  ground connections;  however,  make  sure  you  reconnect  the  ground  or  a  shock  hazard  will  result. Connect the appropriate lead of a fall-of-potential meter to the grounding electrode (ground rod) at the test site. Place the potential reference probe at a distance greater than one-half the diagonal of the building under test, but not less than 25 feet (7.6 meters). Place the current reference probe 90 degrees from the potential reference probe (in a direction away from the facility under test) and  the  grounding  electrode  under  test,  and  at  a  distance  greater  than  one-half  of  the  building diagonal but not less than 25 feet (7.6 meters) from the potential reference probe. Note that the distances between probes are equal. For buildings without a ground loop conductor, perform this test at each grounding electrode. Resistance at each  grounding electrode should be less than 25 ohms  (10  ohms  for  communications  facilities).  Periodic  tests  should  be made  at  approximately the same time each year to minimize confusion resulting from seasonal changes. Figure A6.1.  Auxiliary Probe Locations for Fall-of-Potential Ground Resistance Test.    AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 61 A6.2.  Resistance Test for Above-Ground Petroleum (POL) Tanks. Note:  Before any testing is  performed  for  POL  systems  and  tanks,  the  tester  shall  be  familiar  with  the  containment systems,  their  locations,  and  their  configurations  to  avoid  puncture  and  compromise  of  the containment system. If records of these containment system layouts are not contained in record drawings,  they  shall  be  located  and  defined  and  included  in  record  drawings.  The  method described in paragraph A6.1 is appropriate for medium to small grounding systems. Figure A6.2 illustrates  a  method  to  measure  resistance  to  earth  of  larger,  more  complex  systems  such  as  a large  POL  tank  or  a  substation.  In  areas  where  the  soil  resistivity  is  relatively  high,  a  higher voltage supply may be necessary.  Local  cathodic protection technicians can usually furnish  the material for the test. Make sure the tank is isolated from the utility systems by dielectric flanges. Also be sure the cathodic protection systems are disconnected. Figure A6.2.  Measuring Resistance to Earth of Large POL Tank.  A6.2.1.  Install  a  temporary  ground  bed  of  three  or  four  5-foot  (1.52-meter)  grounding electrodes at a distance equal to five tank diameters. Place a copper-copper sulfate half-cell on the opposite side of the tank. Place it at a distance equal to five tank diameters and along an imaginary straight line through the center of the tank. Make sure it has good contact with earth. A6.2.2.  Between  the  temporary  ground  bed  and  tank,  install  a  12-volt  common  vehicle battery  and  a  dc  ammeter  (multimeter  with  1-amp  scale  may  be  used).  Install  a  high-impedance  (10  megaohm  or  greater)  dc  voltmeter  with  a  1-volt  scale  between  the  half  cell and tank. A6.2.3.  With the battery disconnected, record the voltage reading at the voltmeter. A6.2.4.  Connect  the  battery  and  record  the  current  at  the  ammeter  and  voltage  at  the voltmeter.  Read  voltage  immediately  after  connecting  the  battery.  Current  output  must  be sufficient to effect a minimum 0.05 volt potential shift in the half cell reading. A6.2.5.  Calculate resistance of the tank to earth in ohms by dividing the potential change in volts, DV, by the current in amps, or R = DV/I. For large tanks, typical values would be A6.2.5.  Calculate  resistance  of  the  tank  to  earth  in  ohms  by  dividing  the  potential  change  in 62 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 volts,  DV,  by  the  current  in  amps,  or  R  =  DV/I.  For  large  tanks,  typical  values  would  be 0.040 amps of current and a voltage change of 0.2 volt. A6.3.  Resistance  Test  for  Large  Objects.  This procedure is an alternative to paragraph A6.2 for measuring the resistance to earth of large metallic objects or grids. Be sure to isolate the tank (or object) from the utility system and turn off any cathodic protection system. A6.3.1.  Install  an  8-foot  (2.44-meter)  ground  rod  at  a  distance  of  five  diameters  from  the tank  (or  object  being  tested).  Measure  the  resistance  of  this  rod  to  ground  using  a  fall-of-potential meter. This is the value of Rgr. A6.3.2.  Next,  hook  up  the  circuit  as  shown  in  Figure  A6.3.  The  resistance  of  the  tank  (or object) to earth is determined by Ro = V/A - Rgr, where V is the reading from the voltmeter and A is the reading from the ammeter. The ammeter typically reads between 0.1 amp and 2 amps with a 12-volt source. A6.3.3.  If  soil  resistivity  is  very  high,  increase  the  voltage  until  enough  amps  flow  to  be measurable. Figure A6.3.  Alternate Method of Measuring Resistance to Earth of Large Object.    AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 63 A6.4.  Continuity  Test/Check  for  Separately  Mounted  Lightning  Protection  System  (Mast and Overhead Shield Wire). A6.4.1.  To test the continuity of a mast (Figure A6.4(a)), connect one lead of an ohmmeter to the top of the pole. Connect the other lead to the point where the conductor connects to the ground system at ground level. If the resistance is greater than 1 ohm, check for deficiencies and repair. For mast systems where the masts are metallic, seamless construction of a height to  provide  adequate  protection,  the  continuity  test  can  be  conducted  from  the  base  of  the mast.  Masts  which  are  of  a  height  requiring  multiple  segments  shall  be  assumed  to  be seamless  if,  at  installation,  a  continuity  check  across  the  slip-fit  joint  validates  inherent bonding  by  measuring  1  ohm  or  less  across  this  joint.  Field  work  which  invalidates  the manufacturer’s warranty is not allowed. Initial continuity check across this joint at the time of installation shall be recorded in test records. It shall also be noted that, based on the initial continuity check, the joints are inherently bonded. A6.4.2.  For  an  overhead  wire,  or  catenary,  system  (Figure  A6.4(b)),  visually  inspect overhead  shield  wires  with  binoculars.  If  the  system  contains  mechanical  connectors,  a continuity  test  must  be  conducted  from  the  overhead  shield  wire  to  the  point  where  the conductor connects to the lightning protection ground system. This also applies to guy wires when guy wires are used as a path to ground (used as a down conductor). If the resistance is greater than 1 ohm, check for deficiencies and repair. For systems which use only exothermic welds or high compression crimps, a visual inspection may be used to verify overhead wire and down conductor continuity. The visual inspection may be conducted from  ground level using binoculars. Figure A6.4.  Mast System (a) and Overhead Wire or Catenary System (b).  64 AFI32-1065  14 JUNE 2017 for A6.5.  Continuity  Test/Check Integrally  Mounted  Lightning  Protection Systems.  Perform this test by firmly attaching one lead of an ohmmeter to a corner ground rod. Next, connect the other lead consecutively to each of the air terminals located at the corners of the  building  and  the  air  terminal  (or  metallic  body)  with  the  highest  elevation.  Repeat  the  test from the ground rod located at the opposite corner of the building. For explosive facilities, test the continuity to each air terminal. If the continuity of the system is good, the resistance value at any given test point should be about the same. Investigate any reading over 3 ohms. Note: Tests can  also  be  performed  from  ground  rod  to  nearest  corner  air  terminal  and  from  that  corner terminal to the other corner terminals. A6.6.  Testing  for  Static  Bus  Bars.  Test  static  bus  bars  by  connecting  one  lead  of  a  digital ohmmeter to a ground rod of the facility grounding system. Connect the other lead (in turn) to all the free ends of the bus bar. Bolted connections between bus bar sections are not considered free ends. Figure A6.5 shows how a typical static bus bar test is performed. Investigate any reading more than 3 ohms and correct it. Perform a visual inspection to ensure materials and connections are in good condition. A6.7.  Conductive  Floor  Tests.  Before  using  test  instruments,  be  sure  the  room  is  free  of exposed explosives. To determine floor resistance, measure between two electrodes placed 3 feet (0.91 meter) apart anywhere on the floor. Each electrode shall weigh 5 pounds (2.27 kilograms) and have a dry, flat circular surface area 2.5 inches (63.5 millimeters) in diameter. The resistance between  an  electrode  placed  anywhere  on  the  floor  and  a  ground  connection  shall  not  be  less than 25,000 ohms. For more information see IEEE Std 142 and NFPA 99.
