SUMMARY OF CHANGES This instruction has been extensively reformatted and should be read in its entirety.  The new structure provides ease of references by separating the Officer Performance Report and Enlisted AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 3 Performance  Report  chapters  eliminating  redundancy  in  the  instruction.    These  changes incorporate  and  implement  new  guidance  on  the  Enlisted  Evaluation  System,  including  clarification on:  mandatory comments, prohibited comments, future roles, Professional Military Education (PME) completion, retirement Enlisted Performance Report (EPR) options, clarification for  forced  distributors  regarding  discussions  with  lower  level  leadership,  and  adjustments  to Enlisted Forced Distribution Panel (EFDP) splits and record review.  In addition, the reference and utilization  instructions  for  the  SecAF  Memorandum  of  Instruction  (MOI)  for  use  in  officer evaluation  programs  were  added.  Chapter  5,  Contingency  and  Wartime  Provisions  has  been eliminated and the guidance was merged into the applicable officer and enlisted chapters.  Updates were  made  to  office  symbols  throughout  the  instruction.    These  changes  were  made  in collaboration with the Chief of Air Force Reserve (HQ AF/RE) and the Director of the Air National Guard (NGB/CF), Headquarters Air Force, Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel, and Services  (HQ  USAF/A1)  develops  personnel  policy  for  enlisted  promotion  and  demotion programs.

Purpose.  The Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems have varied purposes.  The first is to establish performance standards and expectations for ratees, meaningful feedback on how well the ratee is meeting those expectations, and direction on how to better meet those established standards and expectations.  The second is to provide a reliable, long-term, cumulative record of performance and  promotion  potential  based  on  that  performance.    The  third  is  to  provide  officer  Central Selection  Boards  (CSBs),  SNCO  evaluation  boards,  the  Weighted  Airman  Promotion  System (WAPS), and other personnel managers’ with sound information to assist in identifying the best qualified officers and enlisted personnel for promotion, as well as other personnel management decisions. 1.1.1.  To accomplish these purposes, the evaluation system focuses on performance.  How well the individual does his or her job, and the qualities the individual brings to the job, are of paramount importance to the Air Force.  It is also important for development of skills and leadership  abilities  and  in  determining  who  will  be  selected  for  advancement  through assignments, promotions, and other personnel actions.  The evaluation system emphasizes the importance of performance in several ways--using periodic performance feedback, as the basis for formal evaluations and through performance-based promotion recommendations. 1.1.2.  Effective evaluators must have an adequate understanding of Officer Evaluation System (OES),  Enlisted  Evaluation  System  (EES),  or  both,  depending  on  who  they  supervise.  Additionally,  Air  Force  members  are  encouraged  to  receive  annual  recurring  OES/EES training.  How and when this training is conducted is at the discretion of the unit commander.  To assist commanders, OES/EES Training Guides are located on the myPers website. 1.1.3.  Unless  stated  otherwise,  the  general  guidelines  outlined  in  this  chapter  apply  to  all evaluations, (OPRs, EPRs, TRs, PRFs, LOEs, ERRFs and RRFs). 1.2.  Forms Used--Purpose and Their Use. 1.2.1.  AF  Form  77,  Letter  of  Evaluation  (LOE),  is  a  multipurpose  evaluation  form  (see Chapter 5 for details). 1.2.2.  AF Form 78, Air Force General Officer Promotion Recommendation (PRF), used to document  performance  and  promotion  recommendations  for  certain  general  officers  (see Chapter 7 for details). 1.2.3.  AF  Form  475,  Education/Training  Report  (TR),  used  to  document  periods  when Airmen are in education or formal training. 1.2.4.  AF Form 707, Officer Performance Report (OPR) (Lt thru Col); AF Form 910, Enlisted Performance Report (AB thru TSgt); AF Form 911, Enlisted Performance Report (MSgt thru SMSgt),  or  AF  Form  912,  Enlisted  Performance  Report  (CMSgt),  are  used  to  document potential  and  performance  as  well  as  provide  information  for  making  a  promotion recommendation, selection, or propriety action; selective continuation; involuntary separation; selective  early  retirement;  assignment;  school  nomination  and  selection;  and  other management  decisions  (see  Chapter  3  [officers]).    For  enlisted  only,  use  ratee’s  grade  or AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 11 regarding  an  assessment  of  an  Airman’s projected grade on the Static Close-Out Date (SCOD) to determine which form to use (see Chapter 4 [enlisted]). 1.2.5.  AF Form 709, Promotion Recommendation Form (PRF), used to assess an officer’s performance-based potential and to recommend promotion from a Senior Rater (SR) (or in case  of  colonel  ratees,  from  the  head  of  the  Management  Level  (ML)  or  designated representative)  to  Central  Selection  Boards  (CSBs).    PRFs  are  removed  from  the  Officer Selection Record (OSR) following the promotion board which they were accomplished for, and are stored electronically.  AF Forms 709 will be used for historical, legal, and appeal purposes only (see Chapter 8 for details). 1.2.6.  AF Form 724, Airman Comprehensive Assessment Worksheet (Lt thru Col), AF Form 931, Airman Comprehensive Assessment Worksheet (AB thru TSgt), and AF Form 932, Airman Comprehensive Assessment Worksheet (MSgt thru CMSgt).  These forms are used to document formal  communication responsibilities, accountability, Air Force culture, critical role in support of the mission, individual readiness and performance between raters and ratees (see Chapter 2 for details). 1.2.7.  AF Form 3538, Retention Recommendation Form (RRF), and AF Form 3538E, Enlisted Retention Recommendation Form (ERRF) are used in conjunction with this AFI and HQ AFPC Retirements  and  Separations  office,  to  document  performance-based  differentiation  and retention recommendations, to assist in involuntary separation and/or retirement boards (AF Form 3538 - Force Shaping, Reduction in Force (RIF), or Selective Early Retirement (SERB) boards; AF  Form 3538E -  Force Shaping, Enlisted Retention  Board (ERB),  Quality  Force Review Board [QFRB]).  These forms are only used at the discretion of the Secretary of the Air Force.  RRFs/ERRFs are removed from the OSR/enlisted board file following the board which they were accomplished for, and are stored electronically.  These RRFs/ERRFs will be used for historical, legal, and appeal purposes only.  See Chapter 9 and AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements, for details. 1.2.8.  AF Form 948, Application for Correction/Removal of Evaluation Reports, is used by RegAF,  and  Reserve  personnel  to  substitute,  correct  or  remove  an  evaluation  when  the applicant  does  not  have  access  to  the  Virtual  Military  Personnel  Flight  (vMPF)/Virtual Personnel Center (vPC)  application process (see  Chapter 10 for details).   Only used when access to the vMPF/vPC or a HR specialist is unavailable, see paragraph 10.4.4.1.2. 1.3.  General Guidelines. 1.3.1.  Access to Evaluations.  Evaluations are For Official Use Only (FOUO) and are subject to the Privacy Act.  They are exempt from public disclosure under DoD Regulation 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302, DoD Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Program, and AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program.  Only persons within the agency who have a proper need to know may have access to the evaluations. The office with custodial responsibility is responsible for determining if a person's official duties require access.  See Chapter 2 for access to the ACA Worksheets. 1.3.2.  Classified Information and Security Classification.  Do not enter classified information in any section of the evaluation; this includes any type of evaluation forms, attachments to evaluations, referral documents, or endorsements to referral documents.

The Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) code alone is unclassified, however it will only be entered on the ratee.  In the Forced Distributor Identification (FDID) block enter nine asterisks, (*********) and in the Senior Rater Identification (SRID) block enter five asterisks, (*****).  In those cases where the evaluator is with a classified organization or location, enter "Data Masked" for organization nomenclature and nothing more. 1.3.3.  Bullet  Format.    Bullet  format  is  mandatory.    Use  bullet  format  as  specified  in  the appropriate table for the evaluation being accomplished.  Bullets are limited to a maximum of two lines per bullet and white space is authorized.  Main bullets begin at the left margin and will have one space after the “-”. 1.3.4.  Special Formatting.  Do not underline, capitalize, or use bold print, unusual fonts or characters,  multiple  exclamation  marks,  or  headings  to  emphasize  comments,  except  as required to identify proper names, publication titles, etc. 1.3.5.  Ratee Identification Data.  The name will be in all uppercase.  The remaining data (e.g. grade, unit, location) will be in upper/lower case. 1.3.6.  Type and Font. 1.3.6.1.  Type  all  evaluations  using  the  electronic  version  of  the  form  from  the  AF Publications website.  EXCEPTION:  Use of automated evaluation systems are authorized (e.g. vPC applications). 1.3.6.2.  Forms will be typed using “Times New Roman”. 1.3.6.3.  Forms will be typed using 12-pitch font.  You must use computerized versions with proportional spacing, provided a 12-pitch font is used.  (T-0). 1.3.6.4.  Handwritten Evaluations. 1.3.6.4.1.  Evaluations  may  be  handwritten,  only  when  authorized  by  HQ AFPC/DP3SP or ARPC/DPT, as appropriate (EXCEPTION:  POTUS/VPOTUS may handwrite evaluations). 1.3.6.4.2.  When authorized, print or legibly write entries. 1.3.6.4.3.  Use only dark blue or black reproducible ink. 1.3.6.4.4.  HQ  AFPC/DP3SP  or  HQ  ARPC/DPT  will  not  approve  requests  if  a computerized form, typewriter, or word processor is available. 1.3.7.  Nicknames and Acronyms. 1.3.7.1.  Nicknames.    Do  not  use  call  signs,  code  names  or  unusual  nicknames  on evaluations.  However,  nicknames  which  are  a  form  of  the  ratee’s  name  are permitted.   Bill/Will  for  William,  Jim  for  James,  Chris  for Christopher/Christine, etc. are authorized. 1.3.7.2.  Acronyms.   EXAMPLE: 1.3.7.2.1.  Uncommon  acronyms  must  be  spelled  out;  however,  if  space  is  limited, define the acronyms in the proper section of the applicable form.  NOTE:  The AF evaluation forms allow the evaluators to explain uncommon acronyms in the Remarks section of the forms (creating a continuation sheet solely to record acronyms is not AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 13 authorized).  When acronyms are used, the acronyms must be listed alphabetically and separated by a semicolon (;). 1.3.7.2.2.  When  used,  first  spell  out  and  follow  with  the  acronym;  e.g.  Personnel Support for Contingency Operations (PERSCO). 1.3.7.2.3.  Acronyms  or  abbreviations  common  throughout  the  Air  Force,  such  as CGO, NCO, CONUS, TDY, etc., are not required to be spelled out. 1.3.8.  Waivers and Recommended Changes.  Send requests for deviations or waivers through the wing commander or the comparative level to HQ AFPC/DP3SP who in turn will forward the request to appropriate office of primary responsibility listed in Table 1.1. 1.3.8.1.

Waiver authority for Tier 0:  Non-AF authority (e.g. Congress, White House etc.). 1.3.8.1.2.  Waiver  authority  for  Tier  1:    MAJCOM/CC  (delegable  no  lower  than MAJCOM/A1. 1.3.8.1.3.  Waiver  authority  for  Tier  2:    MAJCOM/CC  (delegable  no  lower  than MAJCOM/A1K. 1.3.8.1.4.  Waiver authority for Tier 3:  Wing/CC (delegable no lower than FSS/CC or equivalent). 1.3.8.1.5.  Waiver  authority  for  Non-tiered  compliance  items  targeted  for  functions above the wing or equivalent is AFPC/DP3SP. 1.3.8.2.  Waiver Process. 1.3.8.2.1.  Process waiver requests IAW AFI 33-360. 1.3.8.2.2.  If  deemed  necessary,  submit  additional  data  to  substantiate  the  waiver request. 1.3.8.2.3.  Tier  0  waiver:    Following  a  MAJCOM/CC  (delegable  no  lower  than MAJCOM Director) request, the appropriate MAJCOM functional OPR will submit the  package  to  AFPC/DP2SPE.    AFPC/DP2SPE  will  submit  the  package  to  the publication  OPR  (i.e.  external  agency/Non-AF  authority)  for  concurrence/approval.  Package results will be provided to the appropriate MAJCOM functional OPR. 1.3.8.2.4.  Tier  1  waiver:    Following  a  MAJCOM/CC  (delegable  no  lower  than MAJCOM Director) request, the appropriate MAJCOM functional OPR will submit the package to Office Symbol AFPC/DP3SP.  AFPC/DP3SP will process/submit the package to AF/A1P and/or AF/A1 for concurrence.  Package results will be provided to the appropriate MAJCOM functional OPR. 1.3.8.2.5.  Tier  2  waiver:   Staff  waiver  requests  in  accordance  with  MAJCOM guidance. 1.3.8.2.6.  Tier 3 waiver:  Staff waiver requests in accordance with Wing guidance. 14 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 1.3.8.3.  Waiver Period.  Tier 1, 2, and 3 waivers may be approved for a period not to exceed the requested waiver period or 30 calendar days after the approving commander’s tour  length,  whichever  is  shorter.   Because  waivers  are  the  expression  of  a  specific commander accepting risk, Tier 1, 2, and 3 waivers automatically expire 30 days after a change of command unless the new commander renews the waiver. 1.3.8.4.  Filing Process.  A copy of approved waivers are required to become part of the approver’s and requestor’s official records.  1.3.8.5.  Waivers  and  the  Managers  Internal  Control  Toolset  (MICT).    The  requesting commander/director will ensure appropriate waiver information is entered in the MICT within 7 days of waiver approval notification.  1.4.  Preparing and Processing Evaluations. 1.4.1.  Career  Briefs.    Evaluators  are  permitted  to  review  a  career  brief  when  writing  an evaluation.    For  officers,  the  brief  will  be  used  only  to  aid  evaluators  in  making recommendations  for  command,  assignments,  and  Developmental  Education  (DE).    For enlisted, the brief may be used as an aid in determining SNCO stratification/endorsement level eligibility or junior enlisted forced distribution promotion recommendation.  NOTE:  Enlisted only.  Education (such  as Community College of the Air Force (CCAF)) and professional military education (applicable level Distance Learning (DL) or in-residence course) may only be  considered  for  overall  SR  stratification/forced  distribution  eligibility  and  as  leading indicators  of  overall  performance  based  on  completion  during  the  required  window  of eligibility. 1.4.2.  Suspenses. 1.4.2.1.  The  servicing  Military  Personnel  Section  (MPS)  will  monitor  the  evaluation system to ensure prompt performance evaluation submittal. 1.4.2.2.  Do  not  suspense  or  require  raters  to  submit  a  completed  evaluation  with  their signature (digital, “wet” or otherwise) on it to the next evaluator in the rating chain any earlier than five duty days after the close-out date.  If the rater is not available, extend the suspense.  The suspense can be extended to a date that will still allow the evaluation to meet the suspense into the official record 60 days after the close-out date.  NOTE:  This does not preclude a draft copy being routed earlier. 1.4.2.3.  Officer Performance Reports (OPR)/Enlisted Performance Reports (EPR) are: 1.4.2.3.1.  Due to the MPS no later than 30 days after close-out. 1.4.2.3.2.  Due to AFPC/ARPC or office of record no later than 45 days after close-out, so that it can be placed in the records NLT 60 days after the close-out date.  NOTE:  This suspense is to allow for any corrections at the lower level. 1.4.2.3.3.  Filed in the Automated Records Management System (ARMS) no later than 60 days after the close-out. 1.4.2.4.  OPRs/EPRs directed by HQ USAF or NGB are due to HQ AFPC/DP1SSP, HQ ARPC/DPTSE, HQ AF/DPE, HQ AF/DPO, HQ AF/DPG respectively by the suspense date established in the directing letter or message (i.e. Personnel Service Delivery Memorandum [PSDM]). AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 15 1.4.2.5.  Complete referral evaluations  IAW paragraph 1.10. and file in the appropriate record and/or place into ARMS NLT 60 days for RegAF personnel and 90 days for non-Extended Active Duty (non-EAD) personnel, after the close-out date of the evaluation. 1.4.3.  When an Evaluation Becomes a Matter of Record. 1.4.3.1.  All signed evaluations (digitally or “wet” signed) are considered a matter of record once they are uploaded into ARMS.  All evaluations are considered “working copies” until they are made a matter of record. 1.4.3.2.  Once  transmitted  to  HQ  AFPC  or  HQ ARPC,  an  evaluation  can  no  longer  be accessed for correction, unless the evaluation is returned to the unit for corrections.  Any corrections, once transmitted to HQ AFPC or HQ ARPC for processing into the official record, must be submitted through the Evaluation Reports Appeal Board (ERAB) IAW Chapter 10. See paragraph 10.3.  (T-0). 1.4.4.  Attachments  to  Evaluations.    Only  those  documents  authorized  by  this  AFI  will  be accepted  for  file  and  attached  to  the  applicable  evaluation.    EXAMPLE:    Referral memorandums, materials and attachments; rebuttals to referrals; endorsement memorandums; and AF Forms 77. 1.4.5.  Reproducing, Copying and Printing Evaluations. 1.4.5.1.  Printing/Reproducing.  When printed, all evaluation forms will be printed in the head-to-foot format.  Both sides of the forms will be printed whether used or not.  The form will not be altered, (i.e., reduce or enlarged), other than from authorized administrative corrections, (i.e., white out on a date change for “wet” signed evaluations).  The quality of the form will be as close to the original form as possible; sharp, free of excessive smudges, and suitable for scanning. 1.4.5.1.1.  Do not reproduce copies for purposes other than those noted below without the approval of HQ AFPC/DP3SP or HQ ARPC/DPT.  Do not reproduce and or print evaluations except: 1.4.5.1.2.  For  official  actions  such  as  courts-martial;  awards  and  decoration recommendations;  promotion  processing,  demotion,  elimination,  release,  appeal actions, and senior rater stratification/forced distribution procedures; and appropriate assignment  actions  by  AFPC/ARPC/AFRC/RIO  or  AF/DPO/DPG/DPE/RE assignment personnel.  Copies will be provided only to authorized personnel. 1.4.5.1.3.  On written authority of AF/DPG for general officers (NGB-GO for ANGUS general officers); AF/DPO for officers on Extended Active Duty (EAD) in the grade of colonel; HQ AFPC/DP3SP for officers on EAD in the grades of lieutenant colonel and below; or the HQ ARPC/DPTSE for ANG officers in the grades of colonel and below, AFR  officers  not  on  EAD,  and  AGR  or  Voluntary  Limited  Period  of  Active  Duty (VLPAD) officers. 1.4.5.1.4.  As  authorized  by  AFI  33-332,  Air  Force  Privacy  and  Civil  Liberties Program when requested by the ratee or his or her designated legal representative. 1.4.5.1.5.  As required provide copies for file in ARMS, the OSR/NSR, the Officer Command Selection Record (OCSR), or Adjutant General (AG) or NGB/HR record file. 16 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 1.4.5.1.6.  To  replace  missing  or  lost  documents  in  the  Master  Personnel  Records Group  (MPerRGp).    Ensure  copies  are  the  same  size  as  the  printed  document.  Additionally, if the form is not a digitally signed form it must be certified as a true copy (see paragraph 1.14. and Table 1.2.). 1.4.5.2.  Corrected  Copies.    A  Corrected  Copy  may  be  either  a  copy  or  an  original document which contains changes from the original document.  Corrections authorized by the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR) or Evaluation Reports Appeal  Board  (ERAB)  on  “wet  signature”  evaluations  may  require  a  corrected  copy annotation.  In these cases, the following statement will be entered on the reverse bottom margin:  “Corrected  Copy,  HQ  AFPC/DP2SPE  or  HQ  ARPC/DPT,  XX  XXX  XX, certifying  official’s  typed  signature  block  and  signature.”    (Annotation  components:  corrected copy, office/name/rank of official doing correction, date correction made, and signature of the person making the correction.) 1.4.5.3.  Quality and Legibility.  The MPS returns copies that are difficult to read or do not comply with paragraph 1.4.5. 1.4.5.4.  Showing and/or providing copies to the ratee.  Unless the evaluation is a referral evaluation, evaluators are not required to show or provide a copy of the evaluation to the ratee,  until  specified  in  the  applicable  chapter;  Airman  Comprehensive  Assessment Worksheets Chapter 2; OPRs Chapter 3; EPRs Chapter 4; Letters of Evaluation Chapter 5; Training  Reports  Chapter  6;  Promotion  Recommendation  Forms  Chapter  8;  Retention Recommendation Forms Chapter 9 and/or the current program guidance. 1.4.6.  Evaluation identification data review.  If any data is incorrect, notify the Commander’s Support Staff (CSS)/Military Personnel Section (MPS) to ensure corrective action is taken. 1.4.7.  Organization.  Enter ratee’s organizational information as of the close-out date or, for those enlisted airman with a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) or Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) after the established accounting date, use the organizational information as of  the  established  accounting  date  for  the  specific  enlisted  grade.    NOTE:    Deactivated organizations.  If the unit deactivates after the accounting date for SCOD EPRs, the deactivated unit will accomplish the EPRs to include all forced distribution and senior rater endorsement processes.  If the unit deactivated prior to the accounting date, the gaining unit (the unit as of the accounting date) will accomplish all evaluations related matters.  All affected units will coordinate with AFPC/DP2SPE on all actions associated with deactivating units. 1.4.7.1.  Enter the organizational designation, MAJCOM (if applicable) and location.  For RegAF and ARC on EAD, do not enter the component.  If classified, refer to paragraph 1.3.2. 1.4.7.2.  If the command of assignment is an integral part of the organization name, such as “HQ AMC/A1,” it is not necessary to repeat the command (AMC) within parentheses. 1.4.7.3.  On  EAD  (RegAF  and  ARC),  enter  organizational  designation,  MAJCOM  (if applicable)  and  location  as  of  the  close-out  date  or  for  those  enlisted  Airman PCSing/PCAing  to  a  new  PAS  code  after  the  established  accounting  date,  use  the organizational information as of the established accounting date for the specific enlisted grade. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 17 1.4.7.4.  On EAD (RegAF and ARC) and performed duty in an organization other than his or her assigned PAS code, enter the assigned information, followed by “with duty at . . .” to  indicate  the  organization  where  the  ratee  actually  performed  duty.    This  includes personnel on 365-day extended deployment billets.  EXAMPLE:  341st Security Forces Squadron  (AFGSC),  Malmstrom  AFB  MT,  with  duty  at  447  ESFS  (USAFCENT), Baghdad International Airport, Baghdad, Iraq.  NOTE:  Do not use this section to enter a second  organization  if  the  ratee  is  filling  a  dual-hatted  role.    Mention  it  in  the  job description or elsewhere in the evaluation. 1.4.8.  Duty Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC).  The DAFSC is based on the Unit Manpower Document (UMD) authorization. 1.4.8.1.  Officers:  Use the DAFSC the officer is approved for by HQ AFPC and assigned against as of the close-out (“THRU”) date of the evaluation, as reflected on the evaluation notice.  This is not to be confused with an officer’s awarded Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) (PAFSC, 2AFSC, etc.).  If the DAFSC listed on the evaluation notice is incorrect, initiate  corrective  action  immediately,  annotate  the  correct  DAFSC  on  the  notice,  and attach a copy of the documentation reflecting the requested change to the evaluation notice.  MPS personnel must confirm the requested change was approved and that the effective date of the change was on or before the close-out date of the evaluation before forwarding the evaluation to HQ AFPC/HQ ARPC.  If the requested change has not been approved by the  date  the  evaluation  is  ready  to  send  to  HQ  AFPC/HQ  ARPC,  the  DAFSC  on  the evaluation will be changed to match the DAFSC approved in the Personnel Data System (PDS). 1.4.8.2.  Enlisted:  Use the DAFSC as of the established Static Close-out Date (SCOD); if the Airman has a PCS or PCA, use the DAFSC as of the established accounting date.  This is not to be confused with the PAFSC, CAFSC, or 2AFSC, etc.  If the DAFSC listed on the evaluation is incorrect, initiate corrective action immediately.  CSS/MPS personnel must ensure the correct information is reflected and/or updated in the PDS. 1.4.8.3.  An authorized 365-day extended deployment billet:  Use the DAFSC assigned to the position and/or billet that the ratee is officially filling in the deployed location. 1.4.9.  Rank Data.  For officer ranks, the rank must be the rank that the ratee actually holds as of the close-out date of the evaluation.  Even if an officer has been “frocked,” you must enter his or her actual rank, regardless of the billet being filled.  For enlisted ranks, the rank must be the rank the ratee actually holds as of the SCOD of the evaluation or the projected rank the ratee holds as of the SCOD date (i.e., TSgt-select). 1.4.10.  Fitness Data. 1.4.10.1.  When  completing  the  evaluation  the  ratee’s  fitness  status  during  the  entire reporting period, as well as of the close-out date, will be considered when completing the evaluation.    However,  a  current  passing  fitness  test  as  of  the  SCOD  is  required  for promotion eligibility and SR stratification/forced distribution consideration.  See AFI 36-2905,  Fitness  Program,  for  MANDATORY  and  OPTIONAL  command  actions  upon fitness failure. 1.4.10.1.1.  Comments regarding unit fitness achievements are authorized for Airmen who have a key role in the success of unit PT programs.  See paragraph 1.4.10.3.1. 18 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 1.4.10.1.2.  (Officers only)  Unit commanders may request close-out date extensions of  up  to  59  days  for  officers  to  ensure  resolution  of  any  administrative,  or  other significant issues. See paragraph 3.18. for details. 1.4.10.2.  When considering adherence to standards, fitness is one of many standards to be evaluated.   Accordingly,  Airmen  exhibiting  unacceptable  performance,  actions incompatible with AF standards and expectations, and/or Airmen who have routinely (a repeated  inability  to  meet  standards  that  would  render  the  aggregated  performance assessment  over  the  entire  reporting  period  as  below  AF  standards  and  expectations) and/or significantly (a single instance where failure to meet standards is either egregious in  nature  or  so  far  short  of  a  standard  that  it  impacts  overall  aggregated  performance assessment)  failed  to  adhere  to  established  AF  standards  and  expectations  will  be considered as not meeting standards. 1.4.10.2.1.  Enlisted evaluations with a "Met Some But Not All Expectations" will be referred as an AF standard was not met. 1.4.10.2.2.  Officer evaluations with a “Does Not Meet Standards” will be referred as an AF standard has not been met. 1.4.10.3.  Fitness Comments. integral 1.4.10.3.1.  Comments may include performance by PTLs, UFPMs, First Sergeants, Superintendents,  Section  Commanders,  Flight  Chiefs,  Commanders,  and  other members  deemed to  a  particular  organization's  successful  Fitness Program.  EXAMPLE: "Implemented rigorous squadron PT program; drove unit pass rate  from  75%  to  100%"  or  "Ensured  accountability--98%  readiness  rate,  zero overdue/expired tests." 1.4.10.3.2.  It is prohibited to put an individual’s fitness score or fitness category on an evaluation,  unless  the  “Does  Not  Meet  Standards”  or  "Met  Some  But  Not  All Expectations" block is marked and the evaluation is being referred due to fitness failure.  This does not prevent an evaluator from documenting referral comments in other areas outside  of  the  fitness  area  when  an  Airman  displays  a  negative  attitude  or  has  not demonstrated fitness improvement.  In those cases, the referral comments may address the reasons or behavior and will not document the score.  (T-0). 1.4.10.3.3.  Do not comment on an exemption or the reason for exemption. 1.4.11.  Signatures, Signature Elements and Dates. 1.4.11.1.  General Signature and Date Guidelines. 1.4.11.1.1.  Do not sign or date before the close-out (thru date).  Sign on or after the close-out date. 1.4.11.1.2.  Do not sign blank forms or forms not containing ratings. 1.4.11.1.3.  Do not use “auto-signature” pens or delegated “CAC” signatures. 1.4.11.1.4.  Do  not  delay  signing  an  evaluation  due  to  pending  personnel  changes, promotions, or approval of a more prestigious duty title. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 19 1.4.11.1.5.  Do not “back date” the signature.  EXCEPTION:  If, after referring an evaluation  to  the  ratee,  the  evaluation  is  reprinted  for  the  purpose  of  including  all evaluator comments or for making minor administrative corrections that do not require an additional referral to the ratee, all signature dates, up to and including the referring official(s), should reflect the date it was originally signed.  This is necessary to show the dates each referral action actually occurred to ensure the evaluation was properly processed.    All  evaluators,  subsequent  to  the  (last)  referring  official  will  use  either original signature dates or current signature dates. 1.4.11.1.6.  If an evaluator is both the Functional/Acquisition Examiner and the Air Force Advisor, then both positions will be identified.  EXAMPLE:  On the OPR/EPR, you would place an “X” in both the examiner and the advisor blocks. 1.4.11.1.7.  Do not sign as “Select” unless authorized by paragraph 1.4.11.4. 1.4.11.2.  Digital Signatures and Dates. 1.4.11.2.1.  Forms must be digitally signed. 1.4.11.2.2.  Digital signatures must be used by all evaluators and reviewers, unless one or more of the following scenarios apply.  In the few instances where a DoD authorized digital signature is not available; or when at least one evaluator does not have access to a DoD authorized digital signature capability.  If one evaluator or reviewer is unable to access  digital  signature,  all  evaluators  and  reviewers  must  “wet”  sign  and  date  the evaluation.  NOTE:  If wet signed, the AF Form 707, 910, 911, and 912 will be printed head to foot and dates will be handwritten, stamped, or typed. 1.4.11.2.3.  The form is enabled with digital signature and auto date capability.  Forms will be auto-dated only when digital signature is applied. 1.4.11.2.3.1.  Evaluators  cannot  sign  before  the  previous  evaluator  due  to  the security  features  associated  with  the  digital  signature  capability.    EXAMPLE:  Additional rater cannot sign before the rater.  EXCEPTION:  Unless evaluators are separated by the International Date Line. 1.4.11.2.3.2.  Each  evaluator’s  digital  signature  will  lock  their  comments  and ratings;  additionally  it  will  unlock  the  digital  signature  feature  for  the  next evaluator.  EXAMPLE: Rater’s digital signature will unlock the digital signature feature in the additional rater’s block. 1.4.11.2.3.3.  The AF advisor/functional examiner and Forced Distributor (FD) or unit  commander/military  or  civilian  director/other  authorized  reviewer  digital signature  capabilities  are  not  locked  and  are  independent  of  other  evaluator signatures. 1.4.11.3.  Handwritten “Wet” Signatures and Dates.  Dates will be handwritten, stamped or typed.  Must be payroll signature.  Must be in reproducible blue or black ink. 1.4.11.4.  General Officer (GO) Signature Blocks.  The CSAF approved a standardized signature  block  for  GOs.    This  signature  block  will  not  impact  the  signing  of  legal documents for disciplinary (UCMJ) or pay purposes.  In these instances, the member’s signature  will  reflect  their  rank  commensurate  with  their  pay  grade.    Base  legal  office should be contacted where clarification is required. 20 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 1.4.11.4.1.  For Brig/Maj Gen (RegAF and ARC): 1.4.11.4.1.1.  Selects: Upon Senate confirmation, selects may sign all evaluations as “Brig Gen (Sel)” or “Maj Gen (Sel)”, if serving in a SR/reviewer position or assigned to an authorized brig/maj gen officer position.  If not in a SR/reviewer position or assigned to an authorized brig/maj gen officer position, sign as “Col” or “Brig Gen” respectively. 1.4.11.4.1.2.  Frocked:  For all evaluations sign as “Brig Gen” or “Maj Gen”. 1.4.11.4.1.3.  Upon  Senate  confirmation  of  selection  to  brigadier  general  of  a colonel who is already the designated SR for the lieutenants through majors in an organization,  the  Management  Level  (ML)  must  realign  their  Senior  Rater Identifications (SRIDs) and re-designate the selectee as the SR for the colonels and lieutenant colonels of the organization. 1.4.11.4.2.  Only  one  general  officer  or  equivalent  will  sign  an  evaluation  as  an evaluator/reviewer.  EXCEPTION:  See paragraph 1.7.1.7. 1.4.11.4.3.  Senior  Executive  Services  (SES)/GO  Equivalents.    SES  positions  are typically GO equivalent and for some, SR positions.  On evaluations, if an SES is a SR then a GO cannot sign the report.  However, if an SES is not a SR and falls under a GO who  is  a  SR,  based  on  their  position,  then  both  the  SES  and  GO  signatures  are authorized on the evaluation.  There can be two SES signatures on an evaluation report as long as only one of them is designated by the ML as a SR and a GO who is not a SR is not signing the report.  SES is only required to use the term “SES” and the level is optional in the signature element. Bottom line:  There can only be one SR on a report, see paragraph 1.7.1.7. for exceptions. 1.5.  Evaluator Requirements. 1.5.1.  Number of Evaluators. 1.5.1.1.  OPRs will have three evaluators, unless the rater or additional rater is also the reviewer/SR. 1.5.1.2.  EPRs  will  have  at  least  two  evaluators,  unless  the  rater  qualifies  as  a  single evaluator. 1.5.1.2.1.  For CMSgt, no more than two evaluators (the rater and SR) will evaluate the ratee’s performance. 1.5.1.2.2.  For  MSgt  selects  thru  SMSgt,  no  more  than  four  evaluators  (the  rater, additional rater, unit commander/military or civilian director/other authorized reviewer and final evaluator) will evaluate the ratee’s performance. 1.5.1.2.3.

The  commander  of  a  unit  must  review  the  records  of  all  personnel, regardless  of  grade,  assigned  to  and/or  transferred  into  his  or  her  command  to  ensure knowledge of and familiarization with the Airman’s history of sex-related offenses resulting in  conviction  by  courts-martial,  non-judicial  punishment,  or  other  punitive  administrative action in order to reduce the likelihood of repeat offenses will escape the notice of current, subsequent,  or  higher  level  commanders.    This  responsibility  will  be  conducted  by  the immediate commander of the Airman at the lowest unit level.  Sex-related offenses include violations of the UCMJ Article 120, Article 125, Article 120a (stalking), Article 120b (rape and sexual assault of a child), Article 120c (other sexual misconduct, which includes indecent viewing/recording/ broadcasting, forcible pandering, and indecent exposure) or attempts to commit any of those offenses.  These responsibilities will not be delegated. 1.6.2.  General  Evaluator/Reviewer  Responsibilities.    All  evaluators  and  reviewers  are responsible for performing an administrative review of all evaluations and if necessary, return them for correction/completion before sending them to the next level.  As a minimum, this review must ensure: 1.6.2.1.  All applicable blocks are completed (marked, dated, and signed). 24 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 1.6.2.2.  Evaluations contain accurate information (particularly in the ratee identification and job description sections). 1.6.2.3.  Spelling accuracy and proper bullet structure. 1.6.2.4.  Evaluations do not contain inappropriate comments or recommendations. 1.6.2.5.  The information in the evaluation is accurate and not inflated. 1.6.2.6.  Evaluations are properly referred, when necessary. 1.6.2.7.  Evaluations are accomplished IAW this AFI. 1.6.3.  Rater. 1.6.3.1.  For officer evaluations, there must be a minimum number of days supervision; see the applicable Table for the type of evaluation being prepared.  For enlisted evaluations, there must be a minimum of one day supervision to prepare an evaluation. 1.6.3.2.  Ensures the ratee is aware of who is in his or her rating chain. 1.6.3.3.  Must  provide  an  ACA  IAW  Chapter  2.    Official  documented  ACA  does  not preclude a rater from performing day-to-day verbal assessments.  Additionally, raters are required to perform an assessment at the time the evaluation is presented to the ratee.  This assessment  at  the  time  the  evaluation  is  presented,  may  be,  but  is  not  required  to  be officially documented on the ACA worksheet.  If geographically separated, assessments can be performed electronically or telephonically. 1.6.3.4.  Must  consider  the  contents  of  any  Unfavorable  Information  File  (UIF)  and/or Personal  Information  File  (PIF),  if  applicable,  before  preparing  the  performance evaluation. 1.6.3.5.  Assess and document the ratee’s performance, what the ratee did, how well he or she did it, and the ratee’s potential based on that performance, throughout the rating period.  The rater differentiates through an evaluation of performance. 1.6.3.6.  Receives meaningful information from the ratee and as many sources as possible (i.e. LOEs from those who previously supervised the ratee during the reporting period, the First Sergeant, etc.), especially when the rater cannot observe the ratee personally.  The ratee is encouraged to provide the rater with inputs on specific accomplishments however, the ratee will not be directed to write or draft any portion of his or her own performance report.  For ARC members, they should provide information to the supervisor to assist in the preparation of the evaluation.  This may include end-of-tour evaluations. 1.6.3.7.  Considers  the  significance  and  frequency  of  incidents  (including  isolated instances of poor or outstanding performance) when assessing total performance. 1.6.3.8.  Differentiates between ratees with similar performance records; especially when making promotion, stratification, assignment, DE and retention recommendations when not prohibited by this AFI or other special program specific guidance. 1.6.3.9.  Records the ratee’s performance for the rating period on the applicable form. 1.6.3.10.  A rater’s failure to perform one or more of the above responsibilities alone will not form the basis for a successful appeal. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 25 1.6.4.  Additional Rater. 1.6.4.1.  There is no minimum number of days supervision required. 1.6.4.2.  Must be aware of the contents of any UIF and/or PIF, if applicable, and returns evaluation to the rater for reconsideration, if appropriate, to ensure an accurate, unbiased, and an uninflated evaluation. 1.6.4.3.

SNCOs  may  only  be  designated  for  organizations  for  which  no  8F000/First Sergeant authorization exists.  Additional duty first sergeants will not complete evaluation reviews in-lieu of an organization’s 8F000/First Sergeant.  EXCEPTION:  Interim first sergeants, additional duty first sergeants, or designated SNCOs may complete evaluation reviews  when  the  organization’s  8F000/First  Sergeant  is  unavailable  due  to  extended absence (e.g., deployment, lengthy training, or lengthy convalescent leave). 26 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 1.6.7.

Must be aware of the contents of any UIF and/or PIF, if applicable, and returns the  evaluation  to  the  rater  for  reconsideration,  if  appropriate,  to  ensure  an  accurate, unbiased, and an uninflated evaluation. 1.6.7.3.  The review is performed by a military service member designated as the director of, or in command of, a unit (PAS code[s]).   In the commander or director's  extended absence, an individual on G-Series orders or a senior official within the unit commander's jurisdiction designated in writing by the unit commander or director, may complete the review, provided in both cases, the designated individual is the next most senior ranking officer  or  civilian  within  the  organization  (e.g.,  deputy  commander,  operations  officer, deputy director).  Individuals designated in writing to complete the review, in absence of the unit commander or director, may not use the title "commander" or "director" and are to use their assigned duty title on the EPR.  A civilian equivalent, assigned to the position of director, or unit director, responsible for the unit (PAS code[s]), may also complete the review.  The Unit Commander/Military or Civilian Director/Other Authorized Reviewer's review will be accomplished by the home station commander for all individuals assigned to  365-day  extended  deployment,  regardless  of  the  grade  of  the  deployed  rater  and additional rater.  See Attachment 1 for definitions. 1.6.7.4.  Flight commanders do not qualify.  See paragraph 1.7.1.2. 1.6.7.5.

Ensures that no member in the rating chain is his or her spouse or other relative. 1.6.7.12.  Ensures the first sergeant (or additional duty first sergeant/designated SNCO) conducts a quality force review on all EPRs before conducting the commander’s review.  AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 27 1.6.8.  Functional Examiner, Acquisition Examiner and Air Force Advisor. 1.6.8.1.  Functional/Acquisition Examiner/Air Force Advisor Block. 1.6.8.1.1.  For evaluations that do not include an examiner/advisor block, an AF Form 77 will be completed. 1.6.8.1.1.1.  Functional/Acquisition Examiners or Air Force Advisors who desire to make comments may attach an AF Form 77. 1.6.8.1.1.2.  Comments are not mandatory.  However, if used, the intent of these comments  are  to  provide  clarification  and  ensure  the  evaluation  is  written  in accordance with Air Force policy and standards in a joint environment or to clarify functional  or  acquisition-related  considerations;  not list  additional accomplishments  or  voice  disagreement  with  an  evaluator’s  assessment.  Comments are limited to five lines. 1.6.8.1.1.3.  The AF Form 77 will be prepared and electronically forwarded along with the electronic evaluation. to 1.6.8.1.2.  Functional/Acquisition Examiners or Air Force Advisors will not change any statement or rating on the performance evaluation. 1.6.8.1.3.  If the Functional/Acquisition Examiner and the Air Force Advisor are both the same person, both positions will be indicated; both the Functional Examiner and Air Force Advisor blocks will be marked on the OPR/EPR.  For evaluations that do not include the Examiner/Advisor block, i.e. TRs, the Examiner/Advisor will indicate both positions on the AF Form 77. 1.6.8.1.4.  When the Examiner and Advisor are two different people on an OPR/EPR, the person who receives the evaluation first will complete the Functional Examiner/Air Force Advisor block on the OPR/EPR and the next person will complete an AF Form 77.  For evaluations that do not include the Examiner/Advisor block, (i.e. TRs), an AF Form 77 will be prepared for each. 1.6.8.2.  Air Force Advisor Program. 1.6.8.2.1.  When the final evaluator on an OPR, EPR or TR is not an Air Force military member or civilian employee, an Air Force Advisor will be designated to advise raters on matters pertaining to Air Force performance evaluations. 1.6.8.2.1.1.  Normally, a senior Air Force military member on duty with the activity or agency assumes this position.  However, the ML may designate any Air Force member  or  Department  of  the  Air  Force  (DAF)  official  meeting  the  grade requirement with the activity or agency to serve as advisor. 1.6.8.2.1.1.1.  For officers, the advisor will be serving in the grade of colonel or above. 1.6.8.2.1.1.2.  For SNCOs, the advisor will be serving in the grade of major or above. 1.6.8.2.1.1.3.  For TSgts and below, the advisor will be serving in the grade of MSgt or above. 28 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 1.6.8.2.1.1.4.  For  IMAs  and  Participating  Individual  Ready  Reserve  (PIRR) members, the advisor is the person appointed by the ML for the active force. 1.6.8.2.1.2.  When  an  agency  (i.e.,  DoD  departments,  non-Air  Force  schools  or units,  etc.)  has  only  one  Air  Force  member  assigned,  the  ML  for  that  activity appoints an advisor. 1.6.8.2.1.3.  If the commander or other senior official designated in writing by the commander who completes the "commander's review" on an EPR is senior/equal to the last evaluator on the evaluation, (or is also the designated advisor for the unit), and is an Air Force officer or DAF official who meets Air Force Advisor grade  requirements,  the  commander  does  not  need  to  complete  an  advisor statement. 1.6.8.2.2.  The advisor will sign prior to the final evaluator regardless of rank. 1.6.8.2.3.  An Air Force Advisor will have, or be able to obtain, knowledge of the ratee, be higher in grade than the ratee, and, when feasible, be equal to or higher in grade than the SR (officers) or final evaluator (enlisted).  Additionally, an O-6 cannot sign on another O-6. 1.6.8.3.  Functional Examiner.  Designated to ensure functional oversight is provided for individuals in specific career fields.  The examiner accomplishes the examination after the entire rating chain has completed the performance evaluation.  If an Air Force Advisor review is also required, the examiner forwards the evaluation to the advisor.  Otherwise, the examiner forwards the evaluation to the rater to finalize the evaluation.  NOTE:  The examiner will not change any statement or rating on an evaluation nor will any comments be used for accolades, recommendations, etc.  If comments are used the examiner is limited to five lines placed on AF Form 77. 1.6.8.4.  Acquisition Examiner. 1.6.8.4.1.  In  accordance  with  Title  10  U.S.C.  Section  1722  (g),  an  opportunity  is provided for review and inclusion of comments on any performance evaluation of a person serving in an acquisition position by a person serving in an acquisition position in the same acquisition career field.  In most instances, this opportunity is inherent in the completion of the performance evaluation by acquisition officers in the rating chain.  However, in the event neither the rater, additional rater, nor reviewer are on acquisition-coded positions in the same acquisition position category, the ratee may request that the performance evaluation be examined by a qualified acquisition officer from outside the rating chain (i.e., an acquisition examiner). 1.6.8.4.2.  Review  by  an  acquisition  examiner  is  completed  only  when  the  ratee requests a review, and is filling an acquisition-coded position and neither the rater, additional rater nor reviewer are on a coded position in the same acquisition position category. 1.6.8.4.3.  Acquisition positions are identified on the unit manpower document and are also identified on the evaluation notice generated when an evaluation is required.  AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 29 1.6.8.4.4.  The acquisition examiner must be a person in an acquisition-coded position within the same acquisition position category as the ratee.  If the ML does not have anyone who meets the criteria herein, the ML can forward the evaluation to the Air Staff functional or SAF/AQX to identify an acquisition examiner.  The minimum grade of the examiner will be: 1.6.8.4.4.1.  O-6  or  civilian  equivalent  on  a  critical  acquisition  position  (for officers). 1.6.8.4.4.2.  O-4 or civilian equivalent (for enlisted). 1.6.8.4.5.  The acquisition examiner accomplishes the acquisition examination after the entire rating chain has completed the performance evaluation. 1.6.8.4.6.  Comments  are  not  mandatory,  but  if  desired  for  clarification  about acquisition-related considerations, the examiner prepares an AF Form 77 according to Table 5.1. for attachment to the performance evaluation.  The examiner will not change any statement or rating on the evaluation, nor will an AF Form 77 be used simply to include additional comments, accolades, recommendations, etc.  If used, comments are limited to five lines. 1.6.9.  Ratee. 1.6.9.1.  The ratee is equally responsible for ensuring they know their rating chain and that they received an ACA IAW Chapter 2. 1.6.9.2.  For OPR/EPR responsibilities see Chapter 3 and 4. 1.6.9.3.  For PRF responsibilities see Chapter 8. 1.6.9.4.  For appeals see Chapter 10. 1.6.9.5.  Ratee Review.  Evaluations must be reviewed by the ratee prior to becoming a matter of record.  This is the time to review for typos, spelling, and inaccurate data and bring it to the attention of the rater.  If the data is administratively accurate and it is just a matter of the ratee disagreeing with the content, the rater is not required to change their assessment.  When the ratee signs the evaluation, he or she is not concurring with the content, but rather acknowledging receipt and that the ratee has reviewed the evaluation for administrative errors.  If the ratee disagrees with the content, (comments and/or ratings) the ratee may file an appeal IAW Chapter 10 after the evaluation becomes a matter of record.  NOTE:  An ACA worksheet is not required upon completion of the OPR/EPR.  The OPR/EPR serves as official documentation of the feedback provided to the ratee. 1.6.10.  Military Personnel Section. 1.6.10.1.  The  MPS  will  administer  the  base  OES/EES  for  units  and  Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) under their control.  This includes reviewing all evaluations for administrative accuracy and policy compliance IAW this instruction prior to forwarding the evaluation to AFPC/ARPC.  The MPS must also ensure they assist SRs which the MPS services to ensure this AFI is complied with. 1.6.10.2.  Provide technical assistance to the commander and evaluators. 30 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 1.6.10.3.  When applicable, update data into the appropriate system according to the PSD Guide and this instruction. 1.6.10.4.  Evaluations  will  be  routed  within  the  evaluations  system  for  digitally  signed evaluations.    Wet  signature  evaluations  will  be  scanned  and  loaded  into  the  vPC  for transmittal to AFPC or ARPC.  (T-0). 1.6.10.5.  Coordinates referral reports with appropriate work centers in the MPS to ensure Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) updates are accomplished. 1.6.10.6.  MPSs will return evaluations to be re-accomplished when they do not conform to the requirements of this instruction. 1.6.11.  Major  Commands  (MAJCOM).    The  Management  Level  (ML)  and  their  servicing personnel activity. 1.6.11.1.  Designate  SR  positions  and  determine  civilian  equivalency for  SR designations.  NOTE:  If CV is assuming CC responsibilities and the ML wants them to have SR responsibilities, the ML must appoint the CV SR responsibilities in writing. 1.6.11.2.  Manage  the  performance  evaluation  program  for  their  activity,  and  at  their option, quality review PRFs and return them for correction, when necessary. 1.6.11.3.  Print copies of digitally signed evaluations from the ARMS. 1.6.11.4.  Approve evaluators to be from a different ML than that of the ratee IAW ML policy. 1.6.11.5.  Appoint Air Force Advisors in writing and ensure these individuals are current on evaluation policies and procedures. 1.6.11.6.  Appoint Acquisition Examiners and establish OPR routing procedures when the examination cannot be accomplished within the existing rating chain. 1.6.12.  Air  Force  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff,  Manpower,  Personnel  and  Services  (AF/A1). Establishes and approves policy regarding the Air Force OES/EES.  Establishes a triannual evaluation system program review to determine if changes or adjustments are needed. 1.6.13.  Headquarters Air Force Personnel Center Evaluation Programs (HQ AFPC/DP3SP). 1.6.13.1.  Manages the Air Force OES/EES program Air Force-wide. 1.6.13.2.  AFPC/DP1SSP receives all RegAF EPRs/OPRs evaluations via vPC. 1.6.13.3.  AFPC/DP1SSP reviews all referral evaluations on officers (lieutenant through lieutenant colonel), SNCOs, TSgts, and a random sampling (no less than 20%) of all other evaluations for compliance with policy directives and this instruction; returns them for correction when necessary. 1.6.13.4.  AFPC/DP1SSP forwards all RegAF evaluations to ARMS. 1.6.14.  Headquarters Air Reserve Personnel Center (HQ ARPC). 1.6.14.1.  Receives all evaluations for ARC members via vPC. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 31 1.6.14.2.  Reviews all referral evaluations and a random sampling (no less than 20%) of all other evaluations for compliance with policy directives and this instruction; returns them for correction when necessary. 1.6.14.3.  Forwards all ARC evaluations to ARMS. 1.7.  Rating Chain Deviations and Evaluator Changes.  This paragraph does not apply to rater changes due to PCS, PCA, separation, or retirement of the rater.  Raters who are about to, or have PCS’d/PCA’d to a new organization, separate(d), or retire(d) will still accomplish the evaluations they are/were responsible for. 1.7.1.  Rating Chain Deviations. 1.7.1.1.  The commander determines the rating chain for assigned personnel based on Air Force and Management Level (ML) policy.  Commanders may deviate from the normal (supervisory)  rating  chain  only  when  necessary  to  meet  grade  requirements  or  to accommodate  unique  organizational  structures  and  situations  where  personnel  are temporarily loaned or matrixed to other activities outside the ratee’s assigned PAS. 1.7.1.1.1.  The ratee’s parent ML must approve rating chains that involve evaluators from other MLs; however, both MLs (the parent and the temporary ML) must formally agree to the rating chain deviation. 1.7.1.1.2.  A rating chain deviation MUST be in effect for at least 12 months or longer, for the temporary ML to be able to sign reports.  If there is a rating chain deviation for less than 12 months, then the parent ML MUST sign all reports. 1.7.1.1.3.  Upon rating chain deviation approval, the temporary ML will be responsible for  writing  the  member’s  OPR,  PRF,  LOE,  decoration,  etc.  until  the  member  is matrixed  back  under  their  parent  ML.    EXAMPLE:    A  major  is  on  loan  to  the Numbered Air Force (NAF) commander to fill an executive officer position for 12 months.  Through agreement with the parent ML and temporary ML, the parent ML can approve a rating chain deviation.  Once approved, the NAF commander will sign the officer’s OPR, PRF, LOE, decoration, etc. 1.7.1.1.4.  It  is  prohibited  to  make  rating  chain  deviations  (such  as  skipping  an evaluator) solely for reasons of convenience.  EXAMPLE:  Do not skip a rater’s rater who is temporarily unavailable (on leave, TDY, etc.).  Do not skip a rater’s rater for the sole purpose of affording another official in the supervisory chain (i.e., the rater’s rater’s rater or the SR) the opportunity to endorse or comment in an evaluation. 1.7.1.1.5.  Associate Unit:  A unit which integrates members or units of one component of  the  Air  Force  with  members  or  units  of  another  component  of  the  Air  Force  to accomplish  the  USAF  mission  (e.g.,  Air  Force  Reserve  (AFR)/Air  National  Guard (ANG) with the Regular Force).  In these cases, evaluation rating chains may involve different AF components and shall normally be written by the member’s day-to-day supervisor with additional rater IAW affected ML direction.  However, evaluations MUST be returned to the member's ADCON commander/reviewer/SR to finalize the evaluation/endorsement.    This  allows  for  maximum  operational  integration  and reporting accuracy while still meeting administrative (PAS code driven) requirements. 32 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 1.7.1.2.  Flight Commander/Flight Chief Rating Chains. For flight commander and flight chief rating chains, when an officer heads a flight, the position is flight commander and is rated by the squadron commander.  When an enlisted person or civilian heads a flight, the position is a flight chief. Applicable to both the operational and the functional communities. 1.7.1.3.  Personnel assigned to 25th Air Force:  The OPRs of the National Security Agency (NSA)  field  site  directors  at  NSA/CSS/HR  Specialist/HR  Specialist  Texas,  Misawa Cryptologic Group, and Menwith Hill Station will have Director of NSA (DIRNSA) as the additional rater.  The OPR reviewer for these evaluations will be 25 AF/CC.  This will result in the OPR reviewer being lower in rank than the additional rater.  In this case, enter the applicable mandatory statement “Reviewer’s rank is lower than the Previous Rater” in the remarks section of the evaluation. 1.7.1.4.  25th Air Force Groups in USAFE, PACAF and ACC.  Rating Chains/Signature Authorities  for  Intelligence,  Surveillance  and  Reconnaissance  (ISR)  Groups,  the  480 IW/CC will rate the ISR group commanders.  The supported NAF commander will be the additional  rater  and  SR/reviewer.    ML  will  be  the  respective  supported  MAJCOM commander.  25 AF/CC will endorse each officer’s report in the Functional Examiner/Air Force Advisor block.  This policy will apply to current and future 25 AF Groups and 480 IW with the same configuration.  This exception to policy applies only to 25 AF Group Commanders.  All other 25 AF personnel will follow their normal rating chains IAW this instruction. 1.7.1.5.  Senior Defense Official/Defense Attaché (SDO/DATT) Program. 1.7.1.5.1.  SDO/DATT  personnel  will  be  rated  by  Director,  Defense  Intelligence Agency (DIA). 1.7.1.5.2.  SDO/DATT personnel will be additional rated by COCOM. 1.7.1.5.3.  For individuals owned by COCOM, normal processing procedures apply.  Reviewer  statement  will  read  “THE  RATER  IS  ALSO  THE  REVIEWER”  and/or “THE ADDITIONAL RATER IS ALSO THE REVIEWER”.  PRFs in these cases, will be accomplished by COCOM. 1.7.1.5.4.  For individuals owned by DIA, reviewer statement will read “THE RATER IS ALSO THE REVIEWER” and/or “THE ADDITIONAL RATER IS ALSO THE REVIEWER”  and  comments  will  still  be  allowed  in  the  additional  rater  block  by COCOM. 1.7.1.5.5.  Enter the required statement “Two GOs auth IAW AFI 36-2406, paragraph 1.7.” on all evaluations. 1.7.1.6.  If the grade of the home station SR is lower than the deployed rater, (i.e. deployed rater is an O-7 and the home station senior rater is an O-6), enter the required statement  “REVIEWER’S rank is lower than the Previous Rater”. 1.7.1.7.  Currently paragraph 1.4.11.4.2. prohibits multiple GOs from serving as evaluators on performance evaluations.  However, for those personnel filling an authorized 365-day deployment billet, multiple GOs are authorized.  When applicable, enter “Two GOs auth IAW AFI 36-2406, paragraph 1.7.” AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 33 the ratee  has  been  selected 1.7.1.7.1.  Enlisted  personnel  at  home  station  only  (AF  Form  911).    Multiple  flag officer endorsements are only authorized when the rater is a flag officer, but has not been  designated  as  a  SR,  and for  SR stratification/endorsement.    In  such  cases  the  rater  will  complete  AF  Form  911, Sections III through VII; however, performance comments/bullets are only authorized in Sections  III through  IV.  Section VII will only  include the mandatory statement “THE  RATER  IS  ALSO  THE  ADDITIONAL  RATER”,  and  must  include  the applicable rater’s signature element and signature.  The SR [second flag officer] will complete  Sections  IX,  Final  Evaluator’s  Comments  [senior  rater],  to  include  the applicable SR stratification drop-down.  The officer designated as the unit commander will complete Section VIII. 1.7.1.8.  In cases where the rater is a GO (single evaluator) on an evaluation written on an individual filling an authorized 365-day deployment billet, enter the required statement “THE  RATER  IS  ALSO  THE  REVIEWER”  and/or  “THE  ADDITIONAL  RATER  IS ALSO THE REVIEWER”. 1.7.1.9.  GOs signing referral reports.  If the SR is a GO, and is the evaluator who refers the evaluation, the referral document will be the SR’s rater regardless of rank.  Enter the required statement “Two GOs auth IAW AFI 36-2406, paragraph 1.7.” 1.7.2.  Removal of Evaluator from Rating Chain.  Evaluators are not removed from the rating chain  based  solely  on  a  rating  disagreement;  nor  are  they  removed  from  their  evaluator responsibilities automatically.  In most cases, being removed from duties for cause often has no effect on the rater’s ability to render fair and accurate evaluations on subordinates; therefore the evaluator will still be responsible for the evaluations of their subordinates.  For example, being  relieved  from  a  high-visibility  job  due  to  a  non-duty  related  incident  should  not automatically result in the member also being relieved of evaluator responsibilities since there is no threat of reprisal towards subordinates. 1.7.2.1.  If it is determined that removal from evaluator responsibilities are necessary, the removing evaluator must provide written notification of the action to the evaluator being removed, with information copies to the removed evaluator’s immediate subordinate(s) and any other evaluators in the rating chain, through and including the SR.  This action must be accomplished, and the evaluator being removed must acknowledge receipt within 30 days from the date, or the date of discovery, of the incident that lead to the removal from evaluator responsibilities. 1.7.2.2.  If the rater has died, is missing in action, captured or detained in captive status, incapacitated,  or  when  directed  by  the  reviewer/SR  (officers)  or  commander  (enlisted) because the rater is formally relieved from duties as an evaluator or relieved from duty for cause, the additional rater assumes the responsibilities and acquires the number of days supervision (for AF Form 707 only)/ACA dates of the original rater.  When this occurs, a statement explaining why the rater did not prepare the evaluation must be included in the remarks section of the evaluation. 1.7.2.2.1.  Evaluations  already  prepared  by  a  rater  under  these  circumstances  are working  copies  and  may  be  re-accomplished  unless  they  have  become  a  matter  of record. 34 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 1.7.2.2.2.  There is no minimum number of days supervision required for the additional rater.    However,  if  the  additional  rater  has  insufficient  knowledge  to  prepare  the evaluation for the required period of supervision, he or she must gather knowledge of the ratee's duty performance from all available, reliable sources (First Sergeant, former supervisors, etc.). some instances   When rater (EXAMPLE: the  additional 1.7.2.3.  In is physically/geographically separated from the ratee), it may be more practical or desirable for  another  individual  who  has  current  personal  knowledge  of  the  ratee  to  assume  the rater’s responsibilities.  In this case, the unit commander submits the request, through the CSS/MPS/HR Specialist to the SR for approval. 1.7.2.4.  If  unusual  circumstances  dictate  sufficient  knowledge  cannot  be  obtained,  HQ AFPC/DP3SP, AF/DPO, AF/DPE, AF/DPG, the ARPC/DPTSE, NGB/A1P, NGB/HR or NGB-GO (for ANG general officers) authorizes filing an AF Form 77 in the ratee's records stating why an evaluation could not be prepared for the period. 1.7.2.5.  The next evaluator in the rating chain (the additional rater’s rater) assumes the responsibilities  of  the  additional  rater,  when  the  additional  rater  is  unable  to  perform evaluator duties, see paragraph 1.7.1 and paragraph 1.7.2 for applicable reasons.  When the additional  rater’s  rater  is  also  the  reviewer/final  evaluator,  he  or  she  completes  the Additional Rater’s Comments section and Reviewer/Final Evaluator’s Comments of the applicable form and closes the evaluation. 1.8.  Evaluator’s Mandatory Considerations. 1.8.1.  Reporting  Convictions.    To  assist  raters  in  preparing  evaluations,  all  commissioned officers  and  enlisted  members  who  are  in  the  RegAF  or  in  an  active  status  in  a  Reserve Component,  shall  report  (in  writing)  to  their  rater  within  72  hours,  any  conviction  for  a violation of a criminal law of the United States or violations of a criminal law of any other country whether or not the member is on active duty or in an active status at the time of the conduct that provides the basis for the conviction to the member’s rater (first-line military supervisor) or summary courts-martial convening authority.  In the case of a member of the standby  reserve  or  ANG,  all  commissioned  officers  and  enlisted  members  shall  report  (in writing) to their wing commander (or equivalent), in accordance with the requirements below within 30 days.  Or in the case of a member of the individual ready reserve, all commissioned officers and enlisted members shall report (in writing) to the Air Reserve Personnel Center, in accordance with the requirements below within 30 days.  (Ref: National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2006, Public Law 109-163, §554, 119 Stat. 3136, 3264-65). 1.8.1.1.  When to Document.  In deciding whether to document adverse information on the performance evaluation, evaluators must consider the vast majority of Airmen serve their entire career with honor and distinction; therefore, failure to document misconduct which reflects  departure  from  the  core  values  of  the  Air  Force  is  a  disservice  to  all  Airmen.  Additionally, evaluators must consider items listed below when assessing performance and potential, and specifically mention them in evaluations when appropriate. 1.8.1.2.  Impact of the misconduct on the Air Force mission (Did the mission suffer in any way? Was unit morale affected?). AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 35 1.8.1.2.1.  For purposes of this policy, the term “conviction” includes a plea or finding of guilty, a plea of nolo contendere (no contest), and all other actions tantamount to a finding  of  guilty,  including  adjudication  withheld,  deferred  prosecution,  entry  into adult or juvenile pretrial intervention programs, and any similar disposition of charges. 1.8.1.2.2.  For purposes of this policy, a criminal law of the United States includes any military or other Federal criminal law; any State, district, commonwealth, or territorial or equivalent criminal law or ordinance; and any criminal law or ordinance of  any county,  parish,  municipality,  or  local  subdivision  of  any  such  authority,  other  than motor vehicle violations that do not involve a court appearance. 1.8.1.2.3.  RegAF members shall submit reports under this policy within 72 hours of the date the conviction is announced, even if sentence has not been imposed or the member intends to appeal the conviction.  Reserve Component members not on active duty but in an active status shall submit reports under this policy at the first drill period after the date the conviction is announced, or within 30 days of the date the conviction is  announced,  whichever  is  earlier,  even  if  sentence  has  not  been  imposed  or  the member intends to appeal the conviction.  All members who must submit evidence of their conviction, must maintain evidence of compliance with this requirement. 1.8.1.2.4.  In  the  event  a  commander  or  military  law-enforcement  official  receives information  that  a  covered  member  of  the  Armed  Forces  under  the  jurisdiction  of another military department has become subject to a conviction for which a report is required by this section, the commander or military law-enforcement official receiving such  information  shall  forward  it  to  the  member’s  immediate  commander.    If  the member’s  immediate  commander  cannot  be  readily  identified,  the  commander  or military law-enforcement official receiving the information shall forward it to the office designated by the member’s military department identified as required below. 1.8.1.2.5.  Each Service shall institute procedures to ensure that the members covered by the law comply with its requirements and the policy set forth in this instruction.  These  procedures  shall  include  points  of  contact  for  other  military  departments  to comply with the notification requirements above.  Each Service shall also establish points of contact to which Reserve Component members in the individual ready reserve or standby reserve who may not know the identity or address of their first line military supervisor or summary courts-martial convening authority may provide information of a conviction covered under this policy. 1.8.1.3.  Impact of the misconduct on the Air Force as an institution (Did it bring discredit on the Air Force?). 1.8.1.4.  Impact of the misconduct on, and its relationship to the ratee’s duties (Did it affect the ratee’s ability to fulfill his or her duties?). 1.8.1.5.  Impact of the misconduct on the Air Force mission (Did the mission suffer in any way?  Was unit morale affected?). 1.8.1.6.  Grade, assignment and experience of the ratee (Is the ratee in a “sensitive” job? Did the ratee “know better”?). 36 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 1.8.1.7.  Number of separate violations and frequency of the misconduct (Is this an isolated or repeated incident?). 1.8.1.8.  Consequences of the misconduct (Did it result in death, injury, or loss of/damage to military or civilian property?). 1.8.1.9.  Other  dissimilar  acts  of  misconduct  during  the  reporting  period  (Is  the  ratee establishing a pattern of misconduct?). 1.8.1.10.  Existence of unique, unusual or extenuating circumstances (Was the misconduct willful and unprovoked, or were there aggravating factors or events?). 1.8.2.  What to report.  Adverse Actions:  For the purpose of this policy, “adverse action” includes: 1.8.2.1.  Reportable Civilian Offenses.  A conviction of a Federal criminal law; any State, district,  commonwealth,  or  territorial  or  equivalent  criminal  law  or  ordinance;  or  any criminal  law  or  ordinance  of  any  county,  parish,  municipality,  city,  township,  or  local subdivision of any such authority, and convictions of any foreign criminal law; other than convictions  for  motor  vehicle  violations  that  do  not  require  a  court  appearance.  Specifically, convictions required to be reported include the following: 1) any finding of guilt; 2) any plea of guilty; 3) any plea of no contest or nolo contendere; 4) any plea of guilty in exchange for a deferred prosecution or diversion program, and/or; 5) any other similar disposition of civilian criminal charges. 1.8.2.1.1.  Any citation or violation of a motor vehicle offense which ultimately results in a conviction of a lesser included offense (resulting from the original citation) is not reportable if the lesser included offense would not have required a court appearance.  For example, a member who is charged with reckless driving (an offense requiring a court appearance), but is found guilty of speeding (an offense not requiring a court appearance) has not been convicted of an offense requiring reporting.  Commanders and/or  supervisors  who  have  questions  regarding  whether  a  particular  conviction triggers the mandated comment should consult with their Staff Judge Advocate (SJA). 1.8.2.1.2.  Procedures shall be instituted to ensure members covered by the law comply with its requirements and the policy as stated in this instruction.  These procedures shall include points of contact for other military departments to comply with the notification requirements  above.    Points  of  contact  shall  also  be  established  with  the  Reserve Component members in the individual ready reserve or standby reserve who may not know the identity or address of their first line military supervisor or summary courts-martial convening authority may provide information of a conviction covered under this policy. 1.8.2.2.  Substantiated sex-related offenses must be documented in the permanent record.  This  includes  any  substantiated  allegation  of  a  sex-related  offense  against  an  Airman, regardless of grade, that results in conviction by courts-martial, non-judicial punishment, or  other  punitive  administrative  action.    For  the  purpose  of  documenting  sex-related offenses, a punitive administrative action is defined as a Letter of Reprimand (LOR).  Sex-related offenses include violations of Article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)  (rape,  sexual  assault,  aggravated  sexual  contact,  and  abusive  sexual  contact), Article 125 (forcible sodomy, which is forced oral or anal sex, and bestiality), Article 120a AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 37 (stalking), Article 120b (rape and sexual assault of a child), Article 120c (other sexual misconduct, which includes indecent viewing/recording/broadcasting, forcible pandering, and  indecent  exposure)  or  attempts  to  commit  any  of  the  above  offenses.    NOTE:   Documenting sex-related offenses in the evaluation will not limit or prohibit the capacity of the Airman to challenge or appeal the placement of a notation or location of placement of  a  notation  in  the  Airman’s  personnel  service  record.    The  effective  date  of  the requirement for notation is 26 Dec 13. 1.8.2.3.  If a member has been convicted by a courts-martial or if the SR decides to file any adverse  information  in  an  Airman’s  Officer  Selection  Record  (OSR)  or  Senior  Non- Commissioned Officer Selection Record (NSR), comments relating to the ratee’s behavior are mandatory on the ratee’s next OPR, EPR or TR, and PRF (if not already documented on an evaluation or courts-martial in the OSR or NSR).  The evaluation becomes a referral for  the  OPR,  EPR,  and  TR.    Comments  are  also  required  on  Airmen  who  have  been convicted of a “reportable civilian offense” that: 1) is a sexual offense that is the same as, or closely related to, UCMJ, Articles 120, 120a, 120b, 120c, 125, or attempts to commit any of those offenses; 2) carries a possible sentence of confinement for more than one year, or death; or 3) resulted in a sentence that included unsuspended confinement.  For guidance on interpreting this paragraph and sub-paragraphs, supervisors and commanders should consult the servicing SJA. 1.8.2.3.1.  A rater is not required to comment on the conviction in a current report if, during  a  previous  rating  period,  the  rater  already  commented  on  the  underlying misconduct that ultimately resulted in the conviction.  For example:  In a case where a member is arrested and charged with DUI by off-base officials who decline to waive jurisdiction,  the  member’s  commander  issues  the  member  an  LOR  based  on  the evidence, and then comments on the DUI LOR in the ratee’s next evaluation.  Then, the downtown prosecution results in a conviction during a future reporting period.  In such a case, the rater is not required to comment on the DUI conviction because the underlying misconduct that led to the conviction was already addressed in a previous evaluation. 1.8.3.  Waiver Requests.  In extraordinary cases, raters may request a waiver of the mandatory requirement to document civilian convictions for good cause.  The waiver request will route from the rater, through any required additional rater and the ratee’s commander, to the ratee’s SR.  The SR may either deny the waiver request or endorse the request and forward to the MAJCOM/CC (or in the case of reports within AFDW, USAFA, or any DRU or FOA reporting to an activity on the Air Staff, to the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, or in the case of the ANG, to the Director, Air National Guard [DANG]).  The DANG may delegate this authority to  the  respective  state’s  Adjutant  General,  or  equivalent  for  Territories  and  the  District  of Columbia, who will make determinations after consultation with the DANG, or the Deputy Director, Air National Guard (DDANG).  Both the nature and the outcome of the offense for each approved waiver will remain on file with the DANG.  No further delegation is authorized. 1.8.3.1.  If the SR denies the waiver request, the decision regarding the waiver request is final and may not be appealed or considered further.  This does not prevent an individual from  challenging  any  completed  report  in  any  other  appropriate  forums,  e.g.,  ERAB, AFBCMR. 38 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 1.8.3.1.1.  When  the  SR  endorses  the  waiver  request  and  forwards  it  to  the  final approval authority (MAJCOM/CC, Vice Chief of Staff, or DANG), the final approval authority can either approve the exception, allowing the exclusion of any comments in the EPR, OPR, TR, and PRF, or deny the request, resulting in the mandatory inclusion of comments regarding the ratee’s criminal behavior. 1.8.3.1.2.  The final approval authority is delegable to the MAJCOM/CV or, in the case of the AF/CV, to the AF/CVA; no further delegation beyond a TAG, or equivalent, is authorized for the ANG.  The decision of the approval authority is the final decision for such waiver requests and may not be appealed or considered further.  This does not prevent an individual from challenging any completed report in any other appropriate forums, e.g., ERAB, AFBCMR. 1.8.3.1.3.  In order to approve any waiver requests, the approval authority must issue a written finding that the mandatory comments for the specific criminal conviction are not in the best interests of the Air Force and that the inclusion of any such comments would unduly harm the ratee.  Upon final decision, the final approval authority will forward the waiver documentation to AFPC/DP2SPE via email and AFPC/DP1ORM.  Written  waiver  approvals  will  be  filed  in  the  member’s  Master  Personnel  Records Group (MPerRGp) for the sole purpose of documenting the final approval (ARMS, Section H). 1.8.4.  Specificity of Comments.  In all cases, when comments are included in performance evaluations,  they  must  be  specific,  outlining  the  event  and  any  corrective  action  taken. Comments  such  as  “conduct  unbecoming…”  or  “an  error  in  judgment  led  to  an  off-duty incident…”  are  too  vague.    Examples  of  valid  comments  are  “MSgt  Smith  drove  while intoxicated, for which he received an Article 15” and “Capt Jones made improper sexually suggestive and harassing comments to a squadron member, for which he received a letter of reprimand.” 1.8.5.  Organizational  Climate.    Organizational  climate  is  defined  as  the  way  in  which members  in  a  unit  perceive  and  characterize  their  unit  environment.    All  Airmen  are responsible  for  creating  an  organizational  climate  in  which  every  member  is  treated  with dignity and respect, and one that does not tolerate unlawful discrimination, sexual harassment, or sexual assault in any form.  NCOs and officers are not only responsible for creating this environment  but  are  also  accountable  for  it.    NCOs  and  officers  can  build  a  healthy organizational climate by: communicating clear direction at all levels of supervision; adhering to and enforcing standards; not tolerating and, when necessary, appropriately responding to any form of sexual harassment, sexual assault, hazing, unlawful discrimination, or any other conduct  harmful  to  the  good  order  and  discipline  of  the  unit;  being  accountable  for  their actions;  and  cultivating  an  environment  where  teamwork,  unity  and  cohesiveness  are  the standard practice. 1.8.5.1.  All NCO and officer evaluators will assess their ratee(s) on what the member did to ensure a healthy organizational climate. 1.8.5.2.  Commanders at every level have an even greater responsibility to create a healthy climate in their command.  Additionally, they are responsible for ensuring adherence to Sexual  Assault  Prevention  (SAPR)  Program  directives.    Command  climate,  just  like organizational  climate,  is  the  perception  of  a  unit’s  environment  by  its  members.  AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 39 Commanders are ultimately responsible for the good order and discipline in their unit and have unique responsibility and authority to ensure good order and discipline.  Therefore, evaluators  must  take  this  special  responsibility  and  authority  into  consideration  when evaluating a commander’s effectiveness in ensuring a healthy command climate. 1.8.6.  Equal Opportunity and Treatment (EOT).  The expectation is fair and equal treatment of  all  and  enforcement  of  the  same  behavior  in  subordinates.    Evaluators  must  consider  a member’s  commitment  to  EOT  when  evaluating  performance  and  making  a  promotion recommendation.  The goal is to ensure fair, accurate, and unbiased evaluations to help ensure the best qualified members are identified for positions of higher responsibility.  Evaluations must reflect serious or repeated occurrences of discrimination, to include sexual harassment, as prescribed in AFI 36-2706, Equal Opportunity Program Military and Civilian.  Evaluators must also consider commenting on a ratee’s membership in groups that espouse supremacist causes or advocate unlawful discrimination, as prescribed in AFI 51-903, Dissident and Protest Activities. 1.8.7.  Fitness Testing and Education and Intervention Programs.  All personnel must meet established standards IAW AFI 36-2905.  It is the commander’s discretion to annotate a non- current/failing  Fitness  Assessment  (FA)  within  the  reporting  period  on  the  evaluation.  Additionally, it is the commander’s discretion to document the evaluation as a referral for a non-current/failing FA at the evaluation close-out date or EPR SCOD.  Additionally, failure to progress satisfactorily in the Education and Intervention Programs reflects poorly on the Air Force  and  the  Airman.  Unsatisfactory  progress  in  the  Fitness  Improvement  Program  (FIP) program  should  be  considered,  and  if  documented  on  any  evaluation  provide  specific comments  on  the  behavior  that  led  to  the  unsatisfactory  progress  and/or  failure,  with compatible ratings. 1.8.8.  Management Control.  All personnel must manage resources and ensure funds, property, and  other  government  assets  are  protected  against  waste,  loss,  unauthorized  use,  or misappropriation.    Comments  about  failures  in  inherent  or  assigned  internal  control responsibilities,  or  noteworthy  accomplishments  in  improving  internal  controls,  are mandatory. AFI 65-201, Managers’ Internal Control Program Procedures, provides specifics of the Management Control Program. 1.8.9.  Productivity.  While related to internal management control, productivity gains are often a result of improved efficiency rather than establishing or administering policies.  Productivity gains can have measurable monetary or manpower savings and are of significance to the Air Force  and  Air  Reserve  components.    Give  consideration  to  the  ratee's  achievements  in implementing  Defense  Management  Report  principles  and  recommendations,  taking  into account  the  ratee's  opportunity,  or  lack  of  opportunity,  for  such  achievements.    Many suggestions approved under the Airmen Powered by  Innovation (API) Program fall in this category. 1.8.10.  Occupational  Safety  and  Health.    Consider  how  commanders,  managers,  and supervisors  discharge the  Air  Force  Occupational  and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH) Program. 1.8.11.  Security of Classified  Information.  Consider how well ratees who handle or have access  to  classified  information  discharge  security  responsibilities.    When  appropriate, comment on any action, behavior, or condition that is reportable under security regulations. their  responsibilities  under 40 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 1.8.12.  Award of Contracts.  Awarding Contracts to Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (Section 806, Public Law 100- 180).  If you rate an officer who holds a warrant as a contracting officer and who has the opportunity to increase the award of contracts to small disadvantaged business concerns, HBCUs, and minority institutions, you must consider the ratee's ability to increase awards. 1.8.13.  General Accounting Office (GAO), Office of the Inspector General, and Air Force Audit  Agency  (AFAA)  Audit  Resolution.    Prompt,  responsive  and  constructive  action  by managers is an integral part of good management. When applicable, comment on the degree of effectiveness in resolving disputed audit findings and recommendations. 1.8.14.  Acquisition and Management of Inventory Items (Section 323, Public Law 101-510).  For people assigned to Inventory Control Points, consider their efforts to eliminate wasteful practices and achieve cost savings as prescribed in the DoD Inventory Reduction Plan. 1.8.15.  General and Specific NCO Responsibilities.  Consider the ratee’s compliance with mandatory requirements prescribed in AFI 36-2618, The Enlisted Force Structure. 1.9.  Disagreements. 1.9.1.  Explain  any  significant  disagreement  with  a  previous  evaluator  on  a  performance evaluation.  Digitally signed forms will not allow an evaluator to initial in a different rating block,  so  the  evaluator  who  disagrees  must  specifically  state  the  performance  factor  in disagreement, the reason for the disagreement and what their rating is, in their comments.  On evaluations with multiple evaluators, a significant disagreement is a change of any rating or any statement that indicates obvious disagreement with previous evaluator(s). 1.9.2.  Comments to support disagreements are required.  EXAMPLE:  Disagree with rater’s assessment  of  Job  Knowledge—TSgt  Smith  was  unable  to  provide  correct  operating procedures during monthly evaluation; or Capt Rogers was unable to answer critical questions concerning the operation of his flight leading to an ORI rating of “Unsatisfactory” for his squadron. 1.9.3.  Evaluators  should  discuss  disagreements  when  preparing  evaluations.    Preceding evaluators  are  first  given  an  opportunity  to  change  the  evaluation;  however,  they  will  not change their evaluation just to satisfy the evaluator who disagrees.  If, after discussion, the disagreement  remains,  the  disagreeing  evaluator  marks  the  “non-concur”  block,  and  must provide  specific  comments  in  their  block  to  explain  each  item  in  disagreement  prior  to commenting on any performance.  In these cases, the evaluator is forfeiting space normally used to document performance to explain the disagreement.  The evaluator who non-concurs with the evaluation will only attach an AF Form 77 if more space is required to explain the disagreement.  The AF Form 77 will not to be used to add additional performance information. 1.9.4.  On “Wet Signature” evaluations, when the additional rater marks the non-concur block and  shows  disagreement  with  a  "Performance  Assessment  Factor"  by  initialing  a  different block,  or  disagrees  with  the  rater's  overall  narrative  assessment,  the  additional  rater  must provide specific comments to explain the disagreement.  AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 41 1.9.5.  Updating the Personnel Data System (PDS).  When an evaluation contains two different ratings due to an unresolved disagreement, the final evaluator’s rating will be updated in the military data system. For example:  On an enlisted evaluation (AF Form 910) the rater gives the ratee an overall “Exceeded most, if not all expectations” performance assessment, but the additional rater disagrees and changes the performance assessment to an overall “Exceeded some, but not all expectations” performance assessment, the overall “Exceeded some, but not all expectations” performance assessment will be updated in the military PDS, provided the FD concurs with the additional rater’s performance assessment.  Likewise, if the rater gives the ratee an overall “Exceeded some, but not all expectations” performance assessment and the additional rater agrees, but the FD disagrees and changes the performance assessment to an overall  “Exceeded  most,  if  not  all  expectations”  performance  assessment,  the  overall “Exceeded most, if not all expectations” performance assessment is updated in the military PDS.    NOTE:  Two  different  evaluators  can  observe  the  same  performance,  but  assess  it differently.    However,  the  mandatory  comments  should  clearly  state  the  reason  for  the difference in the overall rating performance.  Unless the evaluation is a referral, limit comments to the space provided within each applicable section of the evaluation. 1.9.6.  If the FD/Unit Commander/Military or Civilian Director/Other Authorized Reviewer is junior in grade to the Rater/Additional Rater/Reviewer/Final Evaluator, they must discuss any non-concurrence with the Rater/Additional Rater/Reviewer/Final Evaluator prior to signing the evaluation. 1.10.  Referral Evaluations. 1.10.1.  Purpose.  Referral procedures are established to allow the ratee due process by giving the ratee an opportunity to respond and/or rebut any negative ratings or comments before it becomes a matter of record.  Additionally, it allows evaluators to consider all the facts, some they may not have been aware of, prior to the evaluation becoming a matter of record. 1.10.2.  General Information. 1.10.2.1.  Vague Comments.  Do not make non-specific and/or vague comments about the individual’s behavior or performance.  EXAMPLE:  "Due to a recent off-duty incident, Lt Jackson's  potential  is  limited."    Vague  comments  do  not  fully  explain  the  incident  or behavior, nor do they justify how and why potential is limited (see paragraph 1.12.4. for examples of acceptable  statements).  When doubt arises as to whether a comment is a referral  comment  or  not,  refer  the  evaluation.    NOTE:    If  the  comment  was  on  your evaluation, would you want the opportunity to respond to that comment; if yes, refer the evaluation.  It is better to afford the ratee the due process now while all evaluators are available, than to try and refer it later if directed by the ERAB or AFBCMR. 1.10.2.2.  Any  evaluator  whose  ratings  or  comments  causes  an  evaluation  to  become  a referral evaluation, must give the ratee the opportunity to comment on the evaluation. 1.10.2.3.  A referral evaluation could be detrimental to an Airman’s career, therefore face-to-face interaction is required between the rater and ratee. 1.10.2.4.  If a subsequent evaluator’s comments initially cause an evaluation to become a referral, the evaluation will not be processed electronically, but will be re-accomplished, printed  and  contain  “wet”  (handwritten)  signatures  only.    Dates  will  be  handwritten, stamped or typed. 42 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 1.10.2.5.  An evaluation will be referred more than once when a subsequent evaluator gives additional referral ratings or comments.  NOTE:  Comments regarding the same incident or behavior will not require the evaluation to be referred more than once. 1.10.2.6.  If, after the evaluation has been referred to the ratee, there are any corrections made to the evaluation which add information or changes the content and/or the meaning of the evaluation, (this does not include administrative corrections such as correcting the SSN, spelling, punctuation, etc.), the ratee must again be given an opportunity to respond to  the  new  information  presented  on  the  current  version  of  the  evaluation.    Refer  the evaluation again and allow 3 duty days for a response (30 calendar days for non-EAD).  Care should be taken to ensure the date of the new referral document is on or after the date the new “version” of the evaluation is signed.  If the ratee previously submitted a rebuttal and wishes that original rebuttal to be considered as his or her response to the current version, he or she may simply hand-write a statement to that effect on the new referral letter when receipt is acknowledged and attach the original rebuttal; or submit a new rebuttal. 1.10.2.7.  Although an evaluation may be referred several times during processing, any one evaluator will not normally refer the evaluation more than once.  However, this does not include evaluations referred again IAW paragraph 1.10.4.4. and paragraph 1.10.4.5. 1.10.2.8.  Ensure the name of the next evaluator is included in the space provided in Section XI of the OPR, Section VIII of the AF Form 912, Section VIII of the AF Form 77 (LOE), or in the Referral Memorandum (Figure 1.1) when referral procedures are not included on the form itself. 1.10.2.9.  The  evaluator  who  refers  the  evaluation  and  any  subsequent  evaluators  may continue comments on the AF Form 77 (each evaluator uses a separate form).  Comments are limited to the space on the front of the form (Section IV) and each evaluator will use one AF Form 77.  The purpose of the AF Form 77 is to allow additional space to explain non-concurrence or the detailed behavior that led to the referral evaluation; it is not to be used to provide additional accomplishments.  (T-0). 1.10.2.10.  All original evaluation.  EXAMPLE:  The referral memorandum when applicable, any AF Forms 77, the rebuttal document and any attachments, etc. 1.10.2.11.  In organizations where the rating chains cross MAJCOM lines (for instance, when you have a “dual-hatted” senior rater), the evaluator named in the referral document (Referral  Reviewer)  is  next  official  in  the  chain  of  command  from  the  MAJCOM  that controls the ratee’s organization of assignment, even if the senior rater’s rater belongs to the other MAJCOM. 1.10.2.12.  Airmen  whose  most  recent  performance  report  (OPR/EPR)  or  final  PCS performance  report  is  or  will  be  a  referral  report  are  ineligible  for  PCS  IAW  AFI  36-2110, Assignments. documents  will original the remain attached to 1.10.3.  When to Refer a Performance Evaluation.  Performance evaluations must be referred when: 1.10.3.1.  Comments in any OPR, EPR, LOE or TR, regardless of the ratings if applicable, or  the  attachments  to  that  evaluation,  that  are  derogatory  in  nature,  imply  or  refer  to AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 43 behavior incompatible with, or not meeting minimum acceptable standards of personal or professional conduct, character, judgment or integrity, and/or refer to disciplinary actions.  When  considering  the  Airman’s  ability  to  meet  standards,  consider  unacceptable performance as actions that are incompatible with, and/or Airmen who have routinely (a repeated  inability  to  meet  standards  that  would  render  the  aggregated  performance assessment  over  the  entire  reporting  period  as  below  AF  standards  and  expectations) and/or significantly (a single instance where failure to meet standards is either egregious in  nature  or  so  far  short  of  a  standard  that  it  impacts  overall  aggregated  performance assessment) failed to adhere to established AF standards and expectations.  This includes, but is not limited to, comments regarding omissions or misrepresentation of facts in official statements  or  documents,  financial  irresponsibility,  mismanagement  of  personal  or government affairs, confirmed incidents of discrimination or mistreatment, illegal use or possession of drugs, AWOL, Article 15 action, and conviction by courts-martial.  (T-0). 1.10.3.2.  An officer fails to meet standards in any one of the listed performance factors, in Section III or Section IX of the OPR, the overall evaluation will be a "Does Not Meet Standards" evaluation and the evaluation must be referred.  NOTE:  If the evaluation is marked “Does Not Meet Standards,” there must be a comment pertaining to the behavior in the referring evaluator’s assessment block.  Comments in the referral memorandum do not meet this requirement.  (T-0). 1.10.3.3.  An evaluator marks “Does Not Meet Standards” in Section III of the AF Form 707, “Met some but not all expectations” in any Section of the AF Form 910/911, or a “Do Not Retain” in Section IV of the AF Form 912. (T-0). 1.10.4.  Who Refers a Performance Evaluation. 1.10.4.1.  Any evaluator whose ratings or comments causes the evaluation to be referral will refer the evaluation to the ratee. 1.10.4.2.  If an evaluator did not refer the evaluation and a subsequent evaluator determines the evaluation should be referred, the evaluation must be returned to the evaluator who made the referral comments to refer the evaluation to the ratee. 1.10.4.3.  If there is a disagreement as to whether or not the evaluation should be referred, then the additional evaluator may refer the evaluation on behalf of the previous evaluator. 1.10.4.4.  In cases where the referring evaluator is a MAJCOM or unified commander (e.g. USTRANSCOM/CC), the evaluator named in the referral document (Referral Reviewer) will be the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force who will sign on an AF Form 77.  However, in situations where the rater is a senior rater who has caused the evaluation to be referred and  there  is  an  existing  evaluator  within  the  rater’s  organizational  chain  (to  include MAJCOM), the evaluation should be forwarded to that evaluator for appropriate action, see paragraph 1.7. 1.10.4.5.  On  EPRs,  when  the  additional  rater  refers  the  evaluation,  the  FD  or  unit commander/military or civilian director/other authorized reviewer, is the individual named in  the  referral  document  and  will  review  the  ratee’s  comments.    FDs  or  unit commanders/military  or  civilian  directors/other  authorized  reviewers  complete  their review and may place additional comments, that exceed the one-line provided in the FDs 44 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 or  Unit  Commander/Military  or  Civilian  Director/Other  Authorized  Reviewer’s Comments, section on an AF Form 77. 1.10.4.5.1.  When  the  FD  or  unit  commander/military  or  civilian  director/other authorized  reviewer  refers  the  evaluation,  the  FD  or  unit  commander/military  or civilian/other  authorized  reviewer’s  rater  is  the  individual  named  in  the  referral document. 1.10.5.  Responsibilities. 1.10.5.1.  The Referring Evaluator Responsibilities. 1.10.5.1.1.  Prepares the referral document IAW Figure 1.1., Table 4.2, Table 4.6 and Table 4.9. (Enlisted), Table 3.1. (Officers), paragraph 1.10.6.4. (Training Reports) or Table 5.1. (Letter of Evaluations), whichever is applicable.  NOTE:  The date the rater signs the evaluation and the date of the referral memorandum should be the same date. 1.10.5.1.2.  On or after the close-out date of the evaluation, hand-deliver the referral document to the ratee; obtain the ratee’s signature and the date acknowledging receipt of the referral document.  After the ratee signs the referral document acknowledging receipt, provide a copy of the signed referral document to the ratee, and forward the original referral document to the evaluator named in the referral document, (Referral Reviewer).  Do not include subsequent evaluator comments on the referral OPR/EPR until after the rebuttal is received or rebuttal period has past. 1.10.5.1.3.  If the ratee is geographically separated (including those who have passed their date of separation [DOS]), send a copy of the referral document to the evaluator named  in  the  referral  document  (Referral  Reviewer)  and  mail  the  original  referral document to the ratee by “return receipt requested” mail. 1.10.5.1.4.  Upon receipt of completed evaluation and prior to the evaluation becoming a  matter  of  record,  provide  feedback  to  the  ratee  and  obtain  the  ratee’s acknowledgement of the completed evaluation.  Then forward the evaluation to the ratee’s servicing MPS. 1.10.5.2.  Ratee Responsibilities. 1.10.5.2.1.  The ratee acknowledges receipt of the referral document by signing and dating  it.    The  signature  only  acknowledges  and  verifies  receipt  of  the  referral document on the date indicated; it does not signify concurrence with the evaluation or indicate whether or not the ratee will provide rebuttal remarks. 1.10.5.2.2.  If  the  ratee  is  geographically  separated,  he  or  she  will  sign  the  referral document to acknowledge receipt, then forward the original to the evaluator named in the referral document (Referral Reviewer).  The ratee is encouraged to keep a copy of the referral document. 1.10.5.2.3.  The ratee will provide rebuttal comments to the referral reviewer within 3 duty days, (30 calendar days for non-EAD members) from the date of receipt (if mailed from the date of delivery), regardless if the ratee is still on active duty.  The ratee will hand-deliver the referral documents with all attachments or use certified or registered mail, if geographically separated.  The ratee may request more time from the evaluator AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 45 named in the referral document (Referral Reviewer) not to exceed 45 calendar days from acknowledgement.  Additionally, the ratee: 1.10.5.2.3.1.  May ask the Area Defense Counsel (ADC) or local personnel advisor to provide guidance/assistance in preparing rebuttal comments. 1.10.5.2.3.2.  Must limit comments, including any pertinent attachments, to a total of 10-single side pages (5 pages front and back).  These will not reflect on the character, conduct, integrity, or motives of an evaluator unless fully substantiated and documented.  All pertinent attachments become part of the evaluation filed in the  personnel  record;  however,  items  which  are  already  part  of  the  permanent record,  such  as  copies  of  previous  evaluations,  etc.,  will  be  removed  from  the referral package prior to filing. 1.10.5.2.3.3.  May have another individual prepare comments on his or her behalf (such  as  an  attorney).    However  when  this  is  done,  the  ratee  must  include  a statement confirming the document is to be considered as the ratee’s response.  This statement  will  appear  somewhere  on  the  rebuttal  document  or  be  attached  as  a separate  statement.    NOTE:    If  the  ratee’s  statement  is  provided  as  a  separate attachment, it will be considered part of the 10-page restriction.  (EXAMPLE:  If the attorney submits 5 pages, the ratee can submit 5; if the attorney submits 9 pages, then the ratee can only submit 1 page and vice versa). 1.10.5.2.4.  May choose not to comment on the referral evaluation.  Once the time limit has  elapsed,  the  evaluator  named  in  the  referral  document  (Referral  Reviewer) completes the evaluation and continues normal processing (see paragraph 1.10.5.3.).  Failure  to  provide  comments  does  not  prevent  the  ratee  from  later  appealing  the evaluation IAW the procedures in Chapter 10 once the evaluation becomes a matter of record. 1.10.5.3.  The Referral Reviewer.  (The Evaluator Named in the Referral Document.) 1.10.5.3.1.  Must allow the ratee 3 duty days (30 calendar days for non-EAD members) to submit a rebuttal.  If the ratee needs additional time, i.e., due to the non-availability of an ADC or the referral reviewer has returned the rebuttal because it is more than 10 pages, the referral reviewer may grant an extension as needed.  However, the referral reviewer will not review the evaluation until the 3 duty days (30 calendar days for non-EAD members) have passed, even if the ratee has indicated that he/she will not submit comments. 1.10.5.3.2.  After 3 duty days (30 calendar days for non-EAD members) have passed, the referral reviewer will: 1.10.5.3.2.1.  Review and consider the ratee’s comments, if provided. 1.10.5.3.2.2.  Place the applicable mandatory statement in the evaluators comment block of the appropriate evaluation: 1.10.5.3.2.2.1.  If the ratee provided comments, prepare an endorsement to the evaluation and enter the statement:  "I have carefully considered (ratee's name) comments to the referral document of (date)."  Subsequent evaluators do not enter this statement. 46 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 1.10.5.3.2.2.2.  If the ratee does not forward comments within 3 duty days (30 calendar days for non-EAD) (plus mailing time and any approved extensions), prepare  an  endorsement  to  the  evaluation  and  include  the  statement: "Comments from the ratee were requested but  were not  received  within the required period."  Then send the evaluation on for normal processing. 1.10.5.3.3.  Ensure the date referenced  (paragraph 1.10.5.3.2.2.1.) is the  date of the referral document (either the memorandum on the form or the separate memorandum) and not the evaluation close-out date or the date of the ratee’s rebuttal. 1.10.5.3.4.  Forward the evaluation with all attachments to the next evaluator.  If the referral reviewer is the final evaluator, forward the evaluation to the rater so the rater can  provide  feedback  and  obtain  the  ratee’s  acknowledgement  of  the  completed evaluation. 1.10.5.4.  Additional/Subsequent Evaluators. 1.10.5.4.1.  Send the evaluation to the next evaluator in the rating chain for additional endorsement when an endorser is senior to the commander or when a commander who is senior to the endorser, refers the evaluation, see paragraphs 1.10.4.4. and 1.10.4.5. 1.10.5.4.2.  Prepare the endorsement on AF Form 77. 1.10.5.4.3.  Check the “supplemental sheet” block on AF Form 77, Section IIA and enter appropriate comments in Section IV. 1.10.5.4.4.  If the evaluator on the AF Form 77 is not an Air Force officer, Air Force NCO, or DAF civilian, obtain an Air Force Advisor review. 1.10.5.4.5.  An  additional  rater  or  final  evaluator/reviewer  who  decides  to  refer  an evaluation due to a performance assessment rating or comment made by a previous evaluator, refers it to the ratee before completing his or her portion of the evaluation.  The referral document will instruct the ratee to direct and return any rebuttal comments back to him or her.  Upon receipt of the ratee’s rebuttal, or when 3 duty  days (30 calendar days for non-EAD) have elapsed, the evaluator completes his or her portion of the evaluation. 1.10.5.4.6.  If,  after  referral,  a  subsequent  evaluator  upgrades  the  ratings  and/or invalidates the referral comments so the conditions defined in paragraph 1.10.3. no longer apply, the non-concur block is marked and comments are made in support of the disagreement in the ratings or comments.  The evaluation is no longer considered referral; however, retain all original referral documents and/or correspondence with the evaluation. 1.10.5.4.7.  If, after referral, a subsequent evaluator upgrades ratings or comments but the conditions defined in paragraph 1.10.3. still exist, the non-concur block is marked and comments are made in support of the disagreement in the ratings or comments; the evaluation  remains  a  referral.    Retain  original  referral  correspondence  with  the evaluation. 1.10.5.4.8.  When the last evaluator on the evaluation has caused the evaluation to be referred, the next evaluator in the rating chain (as named in the referral document) will, upon receipt of the ratee’s comments, prepare an endorsement to the evaluation on an AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 47 AF  Form  77  if  no  comment  area  exists  on  the  applicable  evaluation  form.    If  the evaluator named in the referral document (the Referral Reviewer) does not concur with the comments or ratings of the previous evaluator, their endorsement will, in addition to the mandatory referral comments, describe the disagreement (on the first line in the comments area on the applicable evaluation or may continue comments on an AF Form 77). 1.10.5.5.  Deployed Evaluators.  If the referring evaluator is deployed and is referring a home station evaluation, the referring evaluator will sign the referral memorandum and OPR/EPR and forward the evaluation and referral documents to the next evaluator in the rating chain.  The next evaluator in the chain (the referral reviewer) will act on behalf of the referring evaluator who is deployed and issue the evaluation and referral documents to the ratee.  Upon receipt of the ratee’s comments, or at the expiration of the ratee’s 3 duty days (30 calendar days for non-EAD) window to respond, the referral reviewer processes the evaluation and all referral documents IAW paragraph 1.10.5.3. 1.10.6.  Referral Procedures. 1.10.6.1.  Referral OPRs.  The front and reverse side of the AF Form 707 will be completed for  referral  OPRs.    The  referring  evaluator  can  fill  in  the  specifics  in  the  blank  lines provided.  When typing information into the form, you will have to end typing at the end of each line and manually place the cursor on the next line to continue typing.  The text does  not  wrap  around  automatically.    If  the  specific  details  are  too  long  for  the  space allotted the referring evaluator can attach a separate AF Form 77 (see paragraph 1.10.2.9.) and annotate “See Attachment” in the lines provided in this block.  Refer to Table 3.1. for procedures on preparing the AF Form 707. 1.10.6.2.  Referral EPRs.  Prepare a Referral Memorandum (AF Form 910/911 only) IAW Figure 1.1. 1.10.6.3.  Referral Letter of Evaluations (LOEs).  The referral process is accomplished on the form itself. 1.10.6.3.1.  Deployed Commander LOEs.  Complete the AF Form 77 IAW Table 5.1. and paragraph 5.2.1.2.1. for Deployed CC LOE procedures. 1.10.6.3.2.  All Other LOEs. 1.10.6.3.2.1.  Designated  Rater  (Officer  Only).    If  an  LOE  prepared  by  the officially designated rater contained referral comments, the rater prepares an OPR IAW paragraph 1.10.6.1.  The reason for the evaluation will be "Directed by HQ USAF." 60 calendar days of supervision are required, unless the waiver authority extends the requirement, see paragraph 1.13. 1.10.6.3.2.2.  Other than Designated Rater.  Complete Sections I, II, IV, V and VII only IAW Table 5.1.  The referral process itself is not accomplished on the AF Form 77.  EXCEPTION: Deployed Commander LOEs.  If someone other than the officially designated rater prepares an LOE with referral comments, the LOE, along with any rebuttal comments the ratee may want to add, if any, is forwarded to his or her officially designated rater.  The rater will review the LOE and if the rater considers the referral comments serious enough to warrant permanent recording, 48 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 the rater prepares a performance evaluation (OPR/EPR) using the procedures in applicable paragraph 1.10.6.1. (officers) or paragraph 1.10.6.2. (enlisted); and the LOE becomes a referral document attached to the OPR/EPR.  If the rater believes an evaluation is inappropriate, he or she returns the LOE and any rebuttal comments to the ratee.  NOTE:  When the rater determines the comments are not serious enough to warrant permanent recording at that time, they may consider commenting on  the  derogatory  information  in  the  proceeding  evaluation.    Evaluators  should carefully  consider,  whether  the  negative  incident(s)  from  the  referenced  LOE involved  the  character,  conduct,  or  integrity  of  the  ratee,  and  whether  it  has continued  to  influence  the  performance  or  utilization  of  the  ratee  during  the remainder of the reporting period.  In such case, the information included in the evaluation may make the EPR a referral; and the LOE will not be attached to the referral evaluation. 1.10.6.4.  Referral  TR  (AF  Forms  475).    Refer  the  TR  to  the  ratee  using  the  same procedures as you would when referring an OPR/EPR, paragraph 1.10.6.1. and paragraph 1.10.6.2.  Name the commander of the Air Force school or unit of assignment as the next evaluator,  (determined  by  which  organization  is  preparing  the  Training  Report).    The evaluator  reviews  the  ratee’s  comments,  if  provided,  add  the  applicable  mandatory comments IAW paragraph 1.10.5.3.2.2.1. or paragraph 1.10.5.3.2.2.2., and endorses the TR on an AF Form 77, using the first evaluators block. 1.11.  Mandatory Comments.  Specific comments or entries mandated by this AFI are identified by the instruction to “enter” or “include the statement,” followed by the specific comment placed within quotation marks and should be entered on the evaluation exactly as shown. 1.11.1.  Referral Reviewer.  For a referral LOE, OPR/EPR, or TR, the evaluator named in the referral document (Referral Reviewer) must comment as required by paragraph 1.10.5.3.2.2. 1.11.2.  If the rater died, became incapacitated, or was relieved from duties as an evaluator, state the reason in the feedback sections of the AF Forms 707 (see paragraph 1.7.2.2) or in the remarks section of AF Form 910/911/912.  (T-0). 1.11.3.  If a member has been convicted by a courts-martial, comments relating to the ratee’s behavior are mandatory on the ratee’s next OPR, EPR, TR or PRF.  Additionally, comments on individuals who have been found guilty, pled guilty or nolo contendere (no contest), of a reportable civilian offense are mandatory, (see paragraph 1.8.2.1.). 1.11.4.  If  performance  feedback  was  not  accomplished,  state  the  reason  why  it  was  not accomplished.  Rationale must be placed in the Performance Feedback Certification block for AF Form 707, and the Remarks Section XI, AF Form 910/911, and Section VII AF Form 912 and it must be honest, plausible and specific, such as “Midterm ACA not conducted due to only 58 days supervision between initial ACA and the evaluation close-out date,” or “Rater was unable to conduct ACA (state specific reason).”  Non-receipt of a feedback notice, and “administrative oversight,” etc., are not acceptable reasons. 1.11.5.  If  a  member  has  been  assigned  to  serve  as  a  voting  assistance  officer,  a  comment relating  to  how  well  the  member  performed  these  duties  is  required  in  the  members  next performance report (Title 10, Section 1566[f][1]). AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 49 1.12.  General  Prohibited  Evaluator  Considerations  and  Comments.  Certain  items  are prohibited for consideration in the performance evaluation process and will not be commented upon on any OES/EES form.  Except as authorized in this instruction, do not consider, refer to, or include comments regarding: 1.12.1.  Sensitive Information. 1.12.1.1.  Classified Information.  Do not enter classified information in any section of the form. 1.12.1.2.  Confidential Statements.  Confidential statements, testimony, or data obtained by, or presented to, boards under AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. 1.12.1.3.  Appeal Agencies Outside Rating Chain.  Actions taken by an individual outside the normal chain of command that represent guaranteed rights of appeal.  EXAMPLE:  Inspector  General,  Air  Force  Board  for  Correction  of  Military  Records,  EOT/MEO complaints, Congressional Inquiries, etc. 1.12.1.4.  Drug  or  Alcohol  Abuse  Rehabilitation  Programs.    Focus  on  the  behavior, conduct, or performance resulting from alcohol or drug use versus the actual consumption of alcohol or drugs or participation in a rehabilitation program.  Only competent medical authorities can diagnose alcoholism or drug addiction, and the diagnosis is prohibited on evaluations. 1.12.1.5.  Temporary  or  Permanent  Disqualification  under  AFMAN  13-501,  Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Program (PRP).  You may reference the behavior of the ratee that resulted in the action; however, you may not mention the ratee was disqualified. 1.12.1.6.  Fitness Scores/Categories.  It is prohibited to put an individual’s fitness score or fitness category on an OPR or EPR unless the member does not meet standards. 1.12.1.7.  Medical Information.  Only authorized medical officials are in a position to make comments  on  medical  conditions.    Evaluators  must  focus  evaluation  comments  on the behavior and duty performance of the individual.  Comments pertaining to the medical condition, treatment, or diagnosis are prohibited. 1.12.2.  Potential Discriminatory Factors and/or Information. 1.12.2.1.  Race,  Ethnic  Origin,  Gender,  Age,  Religion,  Sexual  Orientation  or  Political Affiliation of the Ratee.  Do not refer to these items in such a way that others could interpret the comments as reflecting favorably or unfavorably on the person.  This is not meant to prohibit evaluators from commenting on involvement in cultural or church activities, but cautions against the use of specific religious denominations, etc.  EXAMPLE:  “Capt Doe is the first female pilot ever selected for training in the F-16”, is an inappropriate reference to gender.  You may use pronouns reflecting gender (e.g., he, she, him, her, his, and hers).  “Wing POC for African American Heritage Committee” or “Arranged a blood drive at the Baptist Memorial Hospital” are acceptable comments. 1.12.2.2.  Family  Activities  or  Marital  Status.    Do  not  consider  or  include  information (either positive or negative) regarding the member’s marital status or the employment, education,  or  volunteer  service  activities  (on  or  off  the  military  installation)  of  the member's family. 50 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 1.12.2.3.  Officer/Enlisted  Club  Membership.    Comments  regarding  a  ratee’s  club membership is prohibited. 1.12.2.4.  Courts-Martial Panel Membership.  Do not consider performance as a member of a courts-martial panel, or render a less than favorable evaluation because of the zeal in which the ratee served as a defense or respondent's counsel (see Article 37, UCMJ).  This is  not  intended  to  inhibit  an  accurate  portrayal  of  a  counsel's  competence  in  the representation of clients. 1.12.3.  Performance Outside the Reporting Period. 1.12.3.1.  Duty  History  or  Performance  Outside  the  Current  Reporting  Period.    Do  not comment on duty history or performance outside the current reporting period, except as permitted by paragraphs 1.12.3.4. and 1.12.4.1.  However, since performance in past jobs is relevant in the preparation of PRFs, raters may include it on PRFs. 1.12.3.2.  Previous  Evaluations  or  Ratings.    Comments  from  previous  evaluations  or ratings are prohibited (i.e., do not include comments from an AF Form 475 on an AF Form 707), except in conjunction with ACA sessions and as outlined in Chapter 8 for promotion recommendation forms.  NOTE:  Evaluators may review previous evaluations to prevent repeating prior accomplishments and making inappropriate recommendations. 1.12.3.3.  (Officer Only)  Events That Occur After the Close-Out Date.  If an incident or event occurs, that reflects a departure from standards and are derogatory in nature, between the time an annual or initial evaluation closes-out and the time it becomes a matter of record that  is  of  such  serious  significance  that  inclusion  in  that  evaluation  is  warranted,  an extension of the close-out date may be requested by the unit commander IAW paragraph 3.18.  This includes completion of an investigation begun prior to the close-out date or confirmation of behavior that was only alleged as of the close-out date.  For fitness, an extension may be requested to authorize an Airman to test again to meet the standard if justification is warranted.  An extension to document a failure for fitness is not authorized. 1.12.3.4.  Prior Events.  Do not include comments regarding events which occurred in a previous reporting period, unless the events add significantly to the evaluation, were not known to and considered by the previous evaluators, and were not previously reflected in an evaluation which is a part of the permanent record (this includes EPRs, OPRs, LOEs and TRs).  EXAMPLE:  An event (positive or negative) which came to light after an evaluation  became  a  matter  of  record,  but  which  occurred  during  the  period  of  that evaluation, could be mentioned in the ratee’s next evaluation because the incident was not previously reported.  In rare cases, serious offenses (such as those punishable by courts-martial)  may  not  come  to  light  or  be  substantiated  for  several  years.    In  those  cases, inclusion  of  that  information  may  be  appropriate  even  though  the  incident/behavior occurred prior to the last reporting period.  Additionally, negative incidents from previous reporting periods involving the character, conduct, or integrity of the ratee that continue to influence  the  performance  or  utilization  of  the  ratee  may  be  commented  upon  in  that context  only.    Commanders  and  SRs  make  the  determination  of  what  constitutes  a significant addition.  If a commander has considered and made a decision not to comment on  a  known  adverse  action,  an  incumbent  commander  may  not  overturn  a  previous commander’s decision by requesting the adverse action be added after the evaluation has been made a matter of record, nor may the incumbent commander include it in the next AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 51 evaluation.  However, if the behavior has continued into the next rating period, an evaluator may comment on the specific behavior for that rating period. 1.12.4.  Derogatory Information and Disciplinary Actions. 1.12.4.1.  Conduct Based on Unreliable Information. 1.12.4.1.1.  Raters must ensure that information relied upon to document performance, especially derogatory information relating to unsatisfactory behavior or misconduct is reliable and supported by preponderance of the evidence. 1.12.4.1.2.  The rater should consult with the servicing SJA whenever any question exists whether this standard has been met. 1.12.4.1.3.  Raters should be particularly cautious about referring to charges preferred, investigations, or boards of inquiry (such as accident investigation boards), or using information obtained from those sources, or any similar actions related to a member, that are not complete as of the close-out date of the evaluation. 1.12.4.1.4.  When it is determined that such conduct is appropriate for comment, refer to the underlying performance, behavior or misconduct itself and not merely to the fact that the conduct may have resulted in a punitive or administrative action taken against the  member,  such  as  a  letter  of  reprimand,  Article  15,  courts-martial  conviction, etc.    EXAMPLE:    An  evaluator  should  say:  “SSgt  Johnson  engaged  in  drunk  and disorderly  conduct  and  drove  while  intoxicated,”  rather  than  “SSgt  Johnson  got  an Article 15 for violations of Article 92 and 134.”. 1.12.4.1.5.  (Officers only)  If an extension to the close-out date might be warranted to determine if reliable information of unsatisfactory performance or misconduct has been established, refer to paragraph 3.18. 1.12.4.2.  Acquittals or Similar Results. 1.12.4.2.1.  Any action against an individual that resulted in acquittal or a failure to successfully implement an intended personnel action is prohibited.  For example, an evaluator cannot say: “SSgt Johnson was acquitted of assault charges,” or “SrA Smith’s involuntary separation action was unsuccessful.” 1.12.4.2.2.  This  does  not  mean,  however,  that  evaluators  cannot  mention  the underlying conduct that formed the basis for the action. 1.12.4.2.3.  A determination as to the appropriateness of doing so should be made only after consultation with the servicing SJA. 1.12.4.2.4.  The  decision  to  include  such  information  should  be  made  only  when evaluators can establish that the information is reliable and supported by preponderance of evidence. 1.12.4.2.5.  In any case, do not reference any punitive or administrative action taken against the individual in response to the conduct for which the member was acquitted or where the action was not actually taken. 52 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 1.12.4.3.  Punishment.  Punishment received as a result of administrative or judicial action is prohibited.  Restrict comments to the conduct/behavior that resulted in the punishment, and the type of administrative or judicial action taken (i.e., Article 15, LOR, LOC, etc.). 1.12.4.3.1.  Acceptable statements:  “Drove while intoxicated, received an Article 15” and “Failed to report to duty, received an LOR,” etc. 1.12.4.3.2.  Prohibited statements:  “Sentenced to 6 months confinement,” “Reduced to the grade of,” “Forfeiture of pay,” “5 days extra duty,” etc. 1.12.4.4.  Disciplinary Actions. 1.12.4.4.1.  Must be reasonably specific, clearly outlining the event and/or behavior.  Comments such as “conduct unbecoming” or “an error in judgment led to an off-duty incident” are too vague and open the door for appeals.  Also see paragraph 1.10.2.1. on vague comments. 1.12.4.4.2.  The  ratee  must  be  advised  specifically  why  he  or  she  is  considered substandard in order to respond appropriately. 1.12.4.4.3.  An evaluation should not simply contain the comment that "MSgt Smith received an Article 15 during this period."  Instead, the underlying conduct should be specifically cited with the resulting action included, such as:  "During this reporting period, Lieutenant Jones sexually harassed a female subordinate for which he received an Article 15," or “MSgt Jones drove while under the influence, for which he received an Article 15.” 1.12.4.4.4.  In any case, the focus of the comment should be on the conduct or behavior.  Evaluators should consult the servicing SJA or local personnel advisors for questions regarding  the  appropriateness  of  including  comments  about  misconduct  and/or  the resulting actions on a performance evaluation. 1.12.5.  Profanity.  Use of profanity in evaluations is prohibited. 1.12.6.  Other Prohibited Comments. 1.12.6.1.  A Recommendation for Decoration.  You may include only those decorations actually approved or presented during the reporting period.  The term “decorations,” as used  here,  applies  to  those  for  which  a  medal  is  awarded  and  worn  on  the  Air  Force uniform, such as an Air Force Achievement Medal.  You may mention other awards, or nominations,  for  honors  and  awards  such  as  "Outstanding  Maintenance  Officer"  or “Twelve Outstanding Airmen of the Year.” 1.12.6.2.  Meeting Goals for/Results of the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC).  Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 950, Solicitation of Federal Civilian and Uniformed Service  Personnel  for  Contributions  to  Private  Voluntary  Organizations,  Section  108 Preventing  coercive  activity,  subparagraphs  (a  through  g).    Comments  pertaining  to met/exceeded goals, collected dollar amount, or meeting/exceeding goal or collecting a particular dollar amount.  (EXAMPLE:  100% contact, $15K raised, 500 contacted, etc.) are prohibited. 1.12.6.3.  WAPS Data.  Score data on the WAPS score notice or SNCO promotion score notice, board scores, test scores, relative standings among peers etc. are prohibited. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 53 1.12.6.4.  Airman Comprehensive Assessment (ACA).  Evaluators do not refer to ACA sessions in any area of the performance evaluation except in the Performance Feedback Certification Block or the remarks section of AF Forms 910/911/912. 1.12.6.5.  Matrices, fact sheets, background sheets or other documents unless specifically authorized in this instruction. Additionally, do not establish panels or boards to review and collectively score, rate, rank, or tally records and/or generate a priority list for determining promotion recommendations, level of endorsement or stratification, except as authorized in paragraphs 4.19.12. and 4.19.13. (see paragraph 8.2.3.1.2 for PRFs). 1.13.  Policy  Deviations  and  Waiver  Requests.  See  Table  1.1.  for  mailing  addresses  for  the Offices of Primary Responsibilities/Point of Contacts (POC). 1.13.1.  Policy Deviations and Waiver Requests. 1.13.1.1.  Send  requests  for  deviations  or  waivers  through  the  wing  commander  or  the comparative  level  to  HQ  AFPC/DP2SPE  (or  appropriate  ANG/AFR)  who  in  turn  will forward the request to appropriate office of primary responsibility listed in Table 1.1. 1.13.1.2.  Requests will be in memorandum format with all the appropriate endorsements and detail the reason for the request with full justification.  If the request is applicable to a specific organization or individual, the request must include the name of the unit or the name of the individual, grade and SSN. 1.13.1.3.  All deviation requests pertaining to SRID issues require coordination through the respective ML and must be signed by the head of the ML. 1.13.1.4.  Signed  requests  will  be  mailed  to  the  HQ  AFPC/DP2SPE  (or  appropriate ANG/AFR office stated in Table 1.1.), or may be sent email. 1.14.  Missing, Late and Removed Performance Evaluations.  When an evaluation is missing, all  attempts  to  locate  it  should  be  exhausted.    If  all  attempts  to  locate  the  missing  report  are unsuccessful, consider re-accomplishing the report; however, before doing so, evaluators should consider such things as:  How long it has been since the report closed out; are all the evaluators readily  available;  is  there  a  draft  of  the  original  still  available;  does  the  ratee  or  any  of  the evaluators happen to have a copy of the original report; can the evaluators now give a fair and accurate report based on the timeframe; etc. (See Table 1.2.) 1.14.1.  Missing Evaluations on RegAF Officers and SNCOs.  The CSS/MPS/AFPC/ARPC initiates action to try and locate the missing report. 1.14.1.1.  If the report is located or is able to be re-accomplished (must be the original evaluators  at  the  time  of  the  close-out),  place  the  original  evaluation  in  the  permanent record  or  send  the  original  to  AF/DPO  for  colonels  and  colonel  selects,  AF/DPE  for CMSgts and CMSgt selects, and  forwards a copy  to  HQ AFPC/DP1ORM for file into ARMS.  If required, update the system following this AFI and supplementary program guidance published on myPers and in the latest Personnel Services Delivery (PSD) Guide. 1.14.1.2.  If  the  report  is  not  located,  or  cannot  be  re-accomplished,  the  HR  specialist (CSS/MPS/AFPC/ARPC agency) who identified the discrepancy will prepare an AF Form 77 according to Table 5.1., and insert the original into the OSR/NSR, or send the original to AF/DPO for colonel and colonel selects, AF/DPE for CMSgts and CMSgt selects, and 54 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 forward a copy to HQ AFPC/DP1ORM for file in ARMS.  Make sure to update the system in accordance with PSD Guide. 1.14.2.  Missing Evaluations on RegAF Enlisted TSgts and Below.  The MPS, initiates action to try and locate the missing report. 1.14.2.1.  If the report is located, forward the original evaluation to HQ AFPC/DP1SSP or ARPC for file in official record (ARMS) and if required, update the system in accordance with PSD Guide. 1.14.2.2.  If a report is not located or cannot be re-accomplished, the MPS prepares an AF Form 77 in accordance with Table 5.1., and forwards AF Form 77 to HQ AFPC/DP1ORM for file in ARMS.  Make sure to update the system in accordance with PSD Guide. 1.14.3.  Missing  Evaluations  for  AFR.  The  OSR  custodian,  the  HQ  ARPC  commander,  or offices as prescribed by the commander concerned, initiates action to try and locate the missing report. 1.14.3.1.  If the report is located, place the original evaluation in the OSR and forward a copy to ARPC/DPTS for filing in ARMS. 1.14.3.2.  If the report is not located or cannot be re-accomplished, the MPS prepares an AF Form 77 in accordance with Table 5.1., and forwards AF Form 77 to HQ ARPC/DPTS for filing in ARMS.  Make sure to update the system in accordance with PSD Guide. 1.14.4.  Missing Evaluations for  ANG only.  The CSS, FSS, or HR Specialist will initiate action to locate missing reports for AGR or DSG personnel, and NGB/HR for Statutory Tour personnel.  If the report is located, forward the original evaluation to HQ ARPC/DPTAR for file in ARMS and if required, update the system in accordance with PSD Guide. 1.14.4.1.  If the report is not located or is unable to be re-accomplished, the CSS, FSS, or HR Specialist will prepare AF Form 77 in accordance with Table 5.1. and forwards AF Form 77 to HQ ARPC/DPTAR for file in ARMS.  HQ ARPC/DPTAR will update the system in accordance with PSD Guide. 1.14.5.  Evaluations Removed From Records Under Chapter 10 or under AFI 36-2603, Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records.  Prepare an AF Form 77 in accordance with Table 5.1., and if required, update the system in accordance with the PSD Guide. 1.15.  National  Emergency  or  Wartime  Provisions.  (Used  only  when  directed  by  the appropriate authority). 1.15.1.  During times of war or national emergency, authorities may change certain evaluation policies and procedures to reduce the workload on field commanders and supervisors while ensuring they still document important performance information.  The following changes apply to  emergencies,  and  only  when  HQ  AFPC/DP3SP,  HQ  AFPC/PRC,  HQ  USAF/A1, USAF/PRC direct, or when one of these agencies specifically delegates this authority to the MAJCOMs.  MAJCOMs may implement these procedures totally or in part depending on the nature and scope of the situation.  In implementing wartime provisions, the MAJCOM must provide specific instructions (with information to the implementing authority) to its respective MPSs regarding completing evaluations, routing evaluations once completed, and any other appropriate actions. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 55 1.15.2.  In  implementing  wartime  provisions,  HQ  AFPC/DP3SP,  in  coordination  with USAF/REP  and  NGB/A1P  will  provide  specific  instructions  regarding  completion  of evaluations,  routing  evaluations  once  completed,  and  any  other  appropriate  actions.  HQ AFPC/DP2SPE  or  HQ  ARPC/PB  will  announce  officer  promotion  recommendation  form (PRF) procedures (see Chapter 8).  HQ USAF/A1PPP and HQ AFPC/DP3SP will determine whether  to  restrict  provisions  for  the  performance  evaluations  to  certain  theaters  or organizations and whether to implement them in part, totally, or incrementally.  They may make performance feedback optional.  Commands must implement the provisions outlined below or as HQ AFPC/DP3SP directs. 1.15.3.  When  to  Submit  Performance  Evaluations.  (when  implemented,  supersedes  the requirements of Chapter 3 and 4). 1.15.3.1.  Evaluations due prior to deployment: 1.15.3.2.  Deployment  does  not  change  the  requirement  to  prepare  annual/biennial evaluations.   56 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 Figure 1.1.  Example Referral Memorandum.

I am referring the attached (indicate Enlisted Performance Report or Education/Training Report) to you according to AFI 36-2406, para 1.10.  It contains comments(s)/ratings(s) that make(s) the evaluation a referral as defined by AFI 36-2406, paragraph 1.10.  Specifically, (state why the evaluation is being referred, i.e., “Specifically, my rating of met some, but not all expectations in section (indicate which section) and my comments, pertaining to your failure to meet and enforce dress and appearance standard in yourself and your subordinates, cause this evaluation to be referred.”).  In addition, if you are Time-In-Grade / Time-In-Service eligible, my rating (s) or comment (s) may result in a promotion recommendation of “Not Ready Now” or “Do Not Promote”.     2.  Acknowledge receipt of this correspondence by singing and dating in reproducible ink.  Your signature on this memo merely acknowledges that a referral evaluation has been rendered; it does not imply acceptance of or agreement with the ratings or comments on the evaluation.  Once this memo is signed, you are entitled to copy.  You may submit comments to rebut the evaluation and address any concerns pertaining to the promotion recommendation.  Send your comments to (name and address of next evaluator) no later than 3 duty days (30 calendar days for non-EAD members) from the date you receive this memorandum.

Pertinent attachments not maintained elsewhere in the official record will remain attached to the evaluation for filling in your official personnel record.  Copies of previous evaluations, etc. submitted as attachments, will be removed from your rebuttal package prior to filing the referral evaluation since these documents are already filed in your official records.  Your rebuttal comments and any attachments may not contain any reflection on the character, conduct, integrity, or motives of the evaluator unless you fully substantiate and document them.  Contact your MPS/CSS/HR Specialist if you require any assistance in preparing your reply to the referral evaluation.  3.  It is important for you to be aware that receiving a referral evaluation may affect your eligibility for other personnel related actions, (i.e., assignments, promotion, etc.).

R U L E A The report was located or successfully re-accomplishment:  1  No 2 3  Yes B and the system contains the overall rating and close-out Yes  No   C Then: When authorized by AFPC/ARPC the CSS/MPS/HR Specialist or The Joint Forces Headquarters (Human Resource Office) or NGB/HR who discovers the discrepancy prepares AF Form 77, see Table 5.1.  When authorized by AFPC/ARPC the CSS/MPS/HR Specialist prepares AF Form 77, see Table 5.1. File the evaluation according to and update the system, if appropriate. Notes: 1.  The gaining CSS/MPS/HR Specialist, The Joint Forces Headquarters (Human Resource Office) or NGB/HR tracks missing or late evaluations. The losing CSS/MPS/HR Specialist, HQ ARPC/DPTSE, the Joint Forces Headquarters (Human Resource Office) or NGB/ HR gives the gaining CSS/MPS/HR Specialist, HQ ARPC/DPTSE, The Joint Forces Headquarters (Human Resource Office) or NGB/ HR a copy of AF Form 330, Records Transmittal/Request, when appropriate.  Do not redo evaluations more than 18 months past the close-out date.  AF Forms 77 are prepared by the CSS/MPS/HR Specialist. 2.  When all attempts to find the missing evaluation fail, the HR Specialist sends an inquiry to HQ AFPC/DP2SPE or ARPC/DPTSE (officers/SNCOs), requesting that HQ AFPC/DP2SPE or HQ ARPC/DPTS search the history files for the EPR rating. Include in the request:   a.  All known information that may assist in identifying the missing evaluation. b.  An account of all actions taken to find the missing EPR.  For personnel with prior service, do not send a request to HQ AFPC/DP2SP or ARPC/DPTSE for missing evaluations earlier than 120 calendar days after the date the ratee reentered to duty. The CSS/MPS/HR Specialist provides this information when requesting a search for missing APRs or EPRs on personnel with prior service: Name, Grade, SSN, Grade at separation, Date of separation, Whether an AF Form 1613,                                                                                                            Statement of Service, might exist. NOTE:  If HQ AFPC/DP2SPE or HQ ARPC/DPTS finds the rating in the history files, complete an AF Form 77 according to Table 5.1.  When more than one evaluation is involved, the MPS/CSS/HR Specialist may prepare one AF Form 77 according to Table 5.1, if no gaps exist in the period of the missing evaluations.  However, if the MPS/CSS/HR Specialist later receives one or more of the missing evaluations, the MPS/CSS/HR Specialist prepares one or more AF Forms 77, as required, so that periods of time in the performance record remain consecutive.  If the rating is not available, comply with Table 5.1.  62 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 Chapter 2 AIRMAN COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT 2.1.  Purpose.  Airman Comprehensive Assessment (ACA) is formal communication between a rater  and  ratee  to  communicate  responsibility,  accountability,  Air  Force  culture,  an  Airman’s critical  role  in  support  of  the  mission,  individual  readiness,  and  performance  feedback  on expectations regarding duty performance and how well the ratee is meeting those expectations to include information to assist the ratee in achieving success.  It is intended to increase Airmen interaction and support at all levels.  If done correctly, mentorship will create and sustain a culture of belonging.  The ACA is also intended to provide Airmen an opportunity to discuss their personal and  professional  goals.    Raters  document  the  session  on  the  ACA  worksheet  and  use  the Performance  Feedback  section  to  assess  or  discuss  the  objectives,  standards,  behavior,  and performance with the ratee.  Providing this information helps an individual contribute to positive communication,  improve  performance,  and  grow  professionally.    The  following  information applies to all military personnel. 2.2.  Responsibilities. 2.2.1.  The ratee will: 2.2.1.1.  Know when ACA sessions are due. 2.2.1.2.  Request a “Ratee Requested” feedback session from the rater, if desired.  If a ratee requests a feedback session, the rater will provide one within 30 days of receipt of the request, provided 60 days have passed, since the last feedback session. 2.2.1.3.  Notify the rater and, if necessary, the rater’s rater, when required or requested ACA did not take place. 2.2.1.4.  Complete Section III on their own and review Section VII (AF Form 724), Section IX (AF Form 931), or VIII (AF Form 932) in preparation for the ACA session. 2.2.1.5.  Sign the ACA indicating the date the supervisor conducted the ACA session. 2.2.2.  The rater will: 2.2.2.1.  Conduct ACA sessions as required by this instruction. 2.2.2.2.  Prepare for, schedule, and conduct ACA sessions according to Table 2.1., Table 2.2., Table 2.3., and Table 2.4. 2.2.2.3.  Understand  Air  Force  standards  and  expectations  and  consider  them  when providing ACA to personnel. 2.2.2.4.  Provide realistic assessments to help the ratee improve performance  and  grow professionally and personally.  Realistic assessments include in-depth discussions with the ratee and written comments on the ACA worksheet, not just marks on the form. 2.2.2.5.  Provide the original completed and signed ACA worksheet to the ratee. 2.2.2.6.  Retain a copy of the signed and dated ACA worksheet.  The midterm ACA is a required, mandatory supporting document to be routed with the performance evaluation (OPR/EPR), however, will not be made a matter of the official record (see para 2.9.3 for individuals authorized to view the ACA).  In addition, the rater will retain a copy of the AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 63 initial and midterm ACA as this may be needed for any future appeals (See paragraph 2.9.).  EXCEPTION:  Extremely rare circumstances may exists where a midterm ACA is not  available  to  be  routed  with  the  evaluation  (i.e.  the  rater  has  been  removed  from supervisory/rater duties). 2.2.2.7.  The ACA is a communication tool and is not to be used to discover or document behavior which may result in administrative or judicial action.  NOTE:  It is important that behavior representing a significant deviation from expected standards is recorded in other administrative forms (i.e. LOR, LOC, LOA, Memorandum for Record [MFR]). 2.2.2.8.  Provide the ratee the most current AF Benefits Fact Sheet (available on AF Portal). 2.2.3.  The rater’s rater will: 2.2.3.1.  Monitor personnel to ensure raters properly conduct ACA sessions. 2.2.3.2.  Conduct ACA sessions when a lower-level rater is not available due to unusual circumstances or when officially assuming the subordinate rater’s responsibilities. 2.2.4.  The unit commander will: 2.2.4.1.  Administer the ACA program. 2.2.4.2.  Monitor raters and ratees to ensure ACA sessions are conducted properly and as required in Table 2.1.  The unit commander can consider disciplining and removing from supervisory positions those raters who fail to conduct documented ACA sessions. 2.2.5.  The Military Personnel Section (MPS) will: 2.2.5.1.  Provide guidance on ACAs to their servicing population. 2.2.5.2.  Not be required to maintain a repository for ACAs for personnel assigned. 2.2.6.  The unit will: 2.2.6.1.  At the unit commander’s request, develop a local tracking mechanism to ensure ACAs are conducted.  It is the responsibility of individual raters to maintain copies of all completed ACAs on their assigned ratees (RegAF only). 2.3.  Who Requires an ACA.  ACAs are mandatory for all RegAF and ARC Airmen, airman basic through colonel.  If an individual requests an ACA session, the rater will provide one within 30 days of receipt of the request, provided 60 days have passed since the last ACA session.  Do not prepare an ACA when a ratee is a captive, patient, prisoner, absent without leave (AWOL), etc.  For  student  officers  receiving  an  AF  Form  475,  Education/Training  Report,  and  for  student enlisted personnel, in approved initial skills training or advanced skills training courses an ACA is not required, but may be given at the discretion of the commander of the school.  For those performance evaluations completed on non-rated initial skills training or advanced skills training course students, academic progress reports, such as the AETC Form 156, Student Training Report, captured  in  the  Technical  Training  Management  System  (TTMS)  or  an  equivalent  document utilized by non-AETC institutions of instruction, will serve in-lieu of the mandatory mid-term ACA.  64 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 2.4.  Guidance for Conducting ACA Sessions.  ACA sessions will be conducted face-to-face.  EXCEPTION:  Raters may conduct sessions by telephone only in unusual circumstances where face-to-face sessions are impractical, such as when the rater and ratee are geographically separated or the rater and/or ratee is on extended TDY.  When a telephonic session is conducted, the rater forwards the ACA worksheet to the ratee to complete Section III and review ”Knowing Your Airmen” sections.  The finalized form is forwarded to the ratee within 10 calendar days after the session. 2.5.  When to Hold Documented ACA Sessions.  See Table 2.1. 2.6.  The ACA Notice. 2.6.1.  The rater should receive a computer-generated notice 30 days after supervision begins (identifying initial or follow-up ACA sessions as required) and again halfway between the time supervision began and the projected performance report close-out date (identifying mid-term ACA session requirement).  This notice serves to remind raters that an ACA session is due; however, failure to receive a notice does not justify failing to hold a required session. 2.6.2.  For  officers  assigned  to  ANG,  the  MPS  will  send  the  ACA  notice  to  the  rater concurrently with the OPR notice or upon initial assignment of the ratee.  If the reason for the OPR is a Change of Reporting Official (CRO), the new rater will receive the ACA notice within 5 working days after the effective date of the change in rater.  Hold the ACA session no later than 60 days after the OPR close-out date, initial assignment date, or effective date of change in rater. 2.6.3.  Since the ratee shares the responsibility to ensure ACA sessions are conducted, an ACA notice is also sent to the ratee, through his or her unit, 30 days after sending the notice to the rater (for officers) or concurrently with the notice sent to the rater (for enlisted). 2.6.4.  For  Individual  Mobilization  Augmentees  (IMA),  the  ACA  notice  is  sent  to  the supervisor’s RegAF MPS for forwarding to the supervisor. 2.6.5.  ANG does not currently have standardized automated process to create ACA notices for raters and ratees.  ANG MPSs may not be able to provide raters and ratees a computer generated ACA notice.  If  computer  generated notices are not available,  MPSs should use alternate  forms  of  communication  to  notify  ratees  and  raters  of  ACA  notices.    Mass communication from MPS to wing personnel is acceptable.  Signed notices are not required for ANG personnel. 2.7.  Which ACA Form to Use. 2.7.1.  For lieutenant through colonel, use AF Form 724. 2.7.2.  For MSgt (and MSgt selects) thru CMSgt, use AF Form 932. 2.7.3.  For TSgt and below, use AF Form 931. 2.8.  Preparing the ACA Worksheet.  The ACA worksheet should, as thoroughly as possible, outline  the  issues  discussed  during  the  ACA  session;  however,  it  is  primarily  a  guide  for conducting the assessment session, not a transcript.  Therefore, omission of an issue from the form does not, by itself, constitute proof that the issue was not discussed. 2.8.1.  The ACA worksheet may be handwritten or typed by the rater providing the assessment. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 65 2.8.2.  For instructions on filling out the ACA see Table 2.2. for the AF Form 931, Table 2.3. for the AF Form 932, and Table 2.4. for the AF Form 724. 2.9.  Disposition and Access. 2.9.1.  The ACA worksheet will not be made an official part of any personnel record (including PIFs) nor used in any personnel action with the exception of paragraph 2.9.3.  NOTE: At a minimum the rater will maintain a copy of the ACA worksheet until the evaluation becomes a matter of record. 2.9.2.  The ratee may use the completed form as he or she desires. 2.9.3.  The ACA worksheet may not be reviewed by anyone other than the rater, ratee and authorized personnel as outlined in the following paragraphs, specifically for the purposes of completing performance evaluations.  It may not be introduced in any other personnel action unless the ratee first introduces it, or alleges, either he or she did not receive required ACA or that the sessions were inadequate. 2.9.3.1.  For enlisted, the additional rater, rater’s rater (when the additional rater is not also the  rater’s  rater),  first  sergeant,  squadron  superintendent  or  equivalent,  squadron commander  (administrative  unit  commander  on  G-Series  orders),  Forced  Distributor, Military/Civilian  Director,  group  superintendent  or  equivalent,  group  commander  or equivalent, command chief, wing commander or equivalent/final evaluator, and functional examiner/Air Force advisor (when applicable) are authorized access to the ACA worksheet specifically for the purpose of completing performance evaluations. 2.9.3.2.  For officers, the additional rater, squadron commander, group commander, wing commander, reviewer, and functional examiner/Air Force advisor (when applicable), are authorized  access  to  the  ACA  worksheet  specifically  for  the  purpose  of  completing performance evaluations. 2.9.4.  Temporary  Duty  (TDY)  supervisors  may  conduct  assessments  and  complete  ACA worksheets; however, the ACA worksheet will not be sent to the home station rater. A memo will be sent to the home station rater if there are any issues the temporary supervisor may wish to address.  EXCEPTION:  If the TDY rater has been officially designated as the ratee’s reporting official, an ACA is required. 2.10.  Failure of Rater to Conduct or Document an ACA Session.  While documented ACA sessions are required by this instruction, they do not replace informal day-to-day communication and feedback.  A  rater's failure to  conduct  a required or requested ACA session, or failure to document  the  session  on  an  ACA  worksheet,  will  not,  of  itself,  invalidate  any  subsequent performance report or PRF. 2.11.  Tracking  ACA  Sessions.  Unit  commanders  may  establish  procedures  beyond  those provided in this chapter to check ACA completion compliance provided those procedures do not violate the privacy of ACA worksheet communications as specified in paragraph 2.9.3.   66 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 Table 2.1.  Airman Comprehensive Assessment Requirements. R U L E  1 2 3 4 B  then the ratee requires the following feedback  Initial (See Note 1 & Note 4) Initial (See Note 1 & Note 4) Midterm (See Note 2 & Note 4) Initial (See Note 1 & Note 4) Midterm (See Note 2 & Note 4) End-of-reporting period (See Note 3) Initial (See Note 1) Midterm (See Note 5) A  If the ratee is  a CMSgt or a colonel a MSgt or SMSgt, major or lieutenant colonel an AB, Amn or A1C (who has already received an EPR), a SrA through TSgt, a lieutenant through captain (see Notes 6 and 7) an AB, Amn or A1C (with less than 20 months TAFMS or less than 20 months DIEUS for ARC) an AB through colonel an AB through colonel Requested by Ratee (See Note 8) When determined necessary by the rater 5 6 Notes: 1.  The rater must conduct the initial feedback session within the first 60 days he or she initially begins supervision. This will be the ratee’s only initial feedback until they have a change of reporting official.  For CMSgts and colonels, this is the only feedback required. 2.  The rater must conduct the midterm feedback session midway between the date supervision begins and the projected close-out date of the next OPR/EPR. 3.  The rater conducts an End-of Reporting Period feedback session when an evaluation has been accomplished.  This session must be conducted within 60 days of the close-out of the evaluation and serves two distinct purposes.  The first purpose is to review and discuss with the ratee the previous reporting period and resulting OPR/EPR.  The second purpose is to establish expectations for the new reporting period.  This feedback may be accomplished using evaluation that just closed or a new AF Form 931/724.  NOTE:  (Officers only) If the evaluation is due to a CRO, the new rater will be required to do an initial feedback in addition to the feedback performed by the previous rater during the presentation of the evaluation.   4.  ARC personnel are not required an ACA if member is pending action IAW AFI 36-3209, Separation and Retirement Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Members. 5.  After the initial feedback session is conducted, conduct a (midterm) feedback session every 180 days until the rater writes an EPR or a CRO occurs. 6.  If the ratee is due an annual evaluation and the period of supervision is less than 150 days, the rater conducts the feedback session approximately 60 days before the projected evaluation close-out date. 7.  (Officers only) If the ratee is getting a CRO evaluation and time permits, the rater will hold a feedback session within 60 days of the close-out date, but not later than 30 days prior. 8.  When a ratee requests a feedback session, the rater must conduct a session within 30 days of the ratee’s request if at least 60 days have passed (at the rater’s discretion) since the last feedback session. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 67 Table 2.2.

General Guidelines. 3.1.1.  See Chapter 1 for general processing guidance applicable to all evaluations. 3.1.1.1.  Do NOT deduct any periods of leave, TDY, absences or periods loaned out to other organizations.  EXCEPTION:  deduct non-rated periods IAW paragraph 3.12. 3.1.2.  Evaluation ratings are used to document performance and potential as well as provide information for making promotion recommendation, selection, or propriety action; selective continuation; involuntary  separation;  selective  early  retirement;  assignment;  school nomination and selection; and other management decisions.  Therefore, evaluators at all levels must use caution to prevent inflation; it is important to distinguish performance among peers and is a disservice to ALL officers when OPR ratings are inflated. 3.1.3.  Marking Ratings.  “Wet Signature Evaluations Only.”  When electronic ratings (Xs) are not used, do not enter hand-marked ratings until signing the evaluation to prevent erroneous entry of ratings by other personnel.  When hand marking, use only reproducible dark blue or black ink. 3.2.  Purpose  of  the  AF  Form  707.  Used  to  document  potential  and  performance  as  well  as provide  information  for  making  a  promotion  recommendation,  selection,  or  propriety  action; selective  continuation;  involuntary  separation;  selective  early  retirement;  assignment;  school nomination and selection; and other management decisions. 3.3.  Who Requires an OPR. 3.3.1.  All officers in the grade of colonel and below (except brigadier general selects), not being evaluated using AF Form 475 (see paragraph 6.1.), or as specified in paragraph 3.4.  See Table 3.2. and Table 3.3. 3.3.2.  Any  individual  being  released  from  RegAF  to  the  ARC  (participating  or  non-participating) regardless of the days of supervision prior to separating. 3.3.3.  Officers filling an authorized 365 day extended deployment billet who have at least 120 days of supervision, prior to departing TDY.  See paragraph 3.9. 3.3.4.  Officer placed in prisoner status, appellate leave, or who are AWOL. 3.3.5.  Officers whose separation/retirement is withdrawn.  An evaluation is due if the officer’s separation/retirement is withdrawn or cancelled.  If the original projected close-out date has not passed, then it will remain the same.  If the original projected close-out date has passed, the close-out date will be the date of the official withdrawal, cancellation, or as soon as the rater has 120 days of supervision whichever occurs first.  The reason for the evaluation is “annual/biennial”. 3.4.  Who Does Not Require an OPR. 3.4.1.  Deployed commanders being evaluated using the AF Form 77, Letter of Evaluation (LOE), see paragraph 5.2.1.2.1. 3.4.2.  RegAF and ARC.  Brigadier general selects, see Chapter 7. 78 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 3.4.3.  State adjutants general (ANG only), see Chapter 7. 3.4.4.  AFR officers in a non-pay status (PAS S7XXXXX). 3.4.5.  Officers  who  are in  full-time  student  (functional  category:  L)  or  patient status.  EXCEPTION:  Officers in the AF Gold Bar program.  The period of supervision must be at least 60 days. 3.4.6.  Officers  in  the  Wounded  Warrior  Program,  or  officers  in  the  Career  Intermission Program (CIP). 3.4.7.  Individuals who died on active duty.  However, if the death occurred on or after the close-out  date  of  an  evaluation  that  was  already  being  processed,  it  becomes  an  optional evaluation. 3.4.8.  When the criteria under paragraphs 3.4.8. (retirement) or 3.4.9. (separation) are met, an annual evaluation becomes optional.  The rater may opt to write an evaluation and the ratee may request an evaluation be written.  If the rater chooses to submit an optional evaluation, the evaluation is written (regardless of whether the ratee wants the evaluation to be written or not).  Should the rater choose to submit an evaluation requested by the ratee, the SR decides whether an evaluation will be written.  If the rater does not wish to submit an evaluation, the SR may direct an evaluation be written. 3.4.9.  Officers with an approved retirement date, provided all the following criteria below are met: 3.4.9.1.  The approved retirement date is within 1 year of the projected annual/biennial close-out date of the evaluation.  EXAMPLE:  If the approved retirement date is 1 Jun 16 and if the close-out date is 1 Jun 15 or later, no evaluation is required.  However, if the close-out date is 31 May 15 or earlier, then an evaluation is required. 3.4.9.2.  The retirement application was approved prior to the projected annual/biennial close-out  date.    EXAMPLE:    If  the  close-out  date  is  1  Jun  15,  and  the  retirement application was approved on 1 Jun 15 or earlier, no evaluation is required.  However, if the retirement  application  was  not  approved  until  2  Jun  15  or  later,  then  an  evaluation  is required. 3.4.9.3.  The  officer  will  not  be  considered  for  promotion,  selective  continuation,  or selective early retirement by a HQ USAF central selection board or a ResAF selection board before retirement. 3.4.10.  Officers with an approved separation date, provided the following criteria below are met: 3.4.10.1.  The officer voluntarily resigns his or her commission, has fulfilled his or her military  service  obligation,  and  is  not  requesting  or  accepting  a  ResAF  commission (RegAF officers) or retaining a ResAF commission (Reserve officers) or transferring to another service. Reminder—evaluations are mandatory  for  anyone being released from RegAF to the ANG or Reserves under the Palace Chase or Palace Front Programs. 3.4.10.2.  The  officer  is  RegAF  and  voluntarily  resigns  his  or  her  commission,  or  is  a Reserve  officer,  and  is  granted  release  from  RegAF  in  lieu  of  action  under  AFI  36-AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 79 3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures for Commissioned Officers, or courts-martial.  (NOTE:  The evaluation is mandatory following courts-martial conviction.) 3.4.10.3.  The officer is involuntarily discharged or released from RegAF under AFI36-3206  and  AFI36-3207,  Separating  Commissioned  Officers;  unless  transferring  to  the ANG/AFR, i.e., Force Management. 3.5.  When to Submit an OPR. 3.5.1.  AF Form 707 for RegAF and Air National Guard (ANG) officers, see Table 3.2. 3.5.2.  AF Form 707 for USAF Reserve (AFR) officers, see Table 3.3. 3.5.3.  AF Form 78, see Chapter 7. 3.6.  Annual Reports.  RegAF and ARC officers’ reports will close-out one year from the close-out date of the last evaluation.  The first evaluation will close-out one year, minus one day (365 days) from the Entered Active Duty (EAD) date.  For example, the officer’s EAD date is 15 Jun 08 then the close-out date would be 14 Jun 09. 3.7.  Change  of  Reporting  Official  (CRO)  Reports  (including  events  of  emergency  or  no-notice departures). 3.7.1.  Use the day before the effective date of the change for the close-out date. 3.7.2.  If either the rater or ratee is pending separation, retirement, or PCS, then the close-out date will be 30 calendar days before the projected departure date, unless: 3.7.2.1.  The 30-day rule will cause a ratee to be ineligible for an evaluation due to a lack of supervision. Then the close-out date must be adjusted to the date on which the rater achieves the required number of day’s supervision, but no later than one day before the departure date. If the rater does not have the required supervision by the day before the departure date, a report is not required. 3.7.2.2.  Approved by the commander, to record significant events.  Then adjust the close-out date accordingly.  Significant events are things such as AF-level awards or derogatory information resulting in a referral evaluation, not simply additional daily achievements.  However,  the  adjusted  close-out  date  must  be  before  the  projected  departure  date  and this only applies to CRO reports. 3.7.2.3.  If the ratee is ResAF officer, adjust the close-out date within the 30-day window to  the  date  the  ratee  completes  the  minimum  16-point,  and  120  days  of  supervision requirement. 3.7.3.  CRO evaluations resulting from a ratee’s or rater’s deployment to a contingency or war zone are waived provided the ratee has received an evaluation within 180 calendar days of the deployment date and provided the ratee's performance is not of a referral nature. 3.8.  Directed by HQ USAF, NGB, or Commander (MAJCOM, wing, group, or squadron, as appropriate). 3.8.1.  Message Directed.  Use the date specified in the message directing the evaluation. 3.8.2.  Missing-in-Action  (MIA)/Captured/Detained.    Use  the  date  the  ratee  was  placed  in MIA, captured, or detained in captive status. 80 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 3.8.3.  Control Roster Placement.  Use one day before being placed on the control roster if the evaluation is directed as a result of placement on the control roster. 3.8.4.  Control Roster Removal.  Use one day before expiration and/or removal from control roster  if  directed  as  a  result  of  being  removed  or  upon  completion  of  the  control  roster observation period. 3.8.5.  Otherwise Directed.  Use the date as otherwise directed by the commander, see Table 3.2. and Table 3.3. 3.9.  365-day Extended Deployment Officer Performance Reports (OPRs).  NOTE:  These instructions apply only to those individuals who are actually selected to fill an official Extended Deployment requirement.  Do not use these instructions for individuals filling other requirements, even though they may be extended to, or beyond 365-days. 3.9.1.  Home Station Rating Chain Responsibilities: 3.9.1.1.  Prior To Departure: 3.9.1.1.1.  If there has been at least 120 days supervision, the home station CSS/HR Specialist will generate a CRO evaluation. 3.9.1.1.2.  If there has been less than 120 days supervision, an informal LOE is required and home station CSS/HR Specialist will send the LOE to the deployed PERSCO when the member’s annual evaluation becomes due.  The deployed rater may or may not use the information when preparing the annual evaluation. 3.9.1.1.3.  If there has been less than 120 days supervision, but it has been more than 1 year since the member’s last evaluation, only 60 days supervision is required and an annual evaluation will be accomplished. 3.9.1.1.4.  If the deployed rater is known prior to departure, the CSS/HR Specialist will update the deployed rater.  In most cases, however, the deployed rater will not be known until the member arrives to the deployed location. In that case, use the home station commander  as  a  temporary  rater.    This  will  facilitate  home  station  and  deployed commander’s direct line of communication to ensure the rating chain is established and updated in a timely matter.  EXAMPLE:  If the data is not updated immediately, a feedback notification rip will produce within 30 days and that alone should act as a reminder to the commander that the deployed data needs to be updated. 3.9.1.2.  Upon Arrival in the AOR:  The home station CSS/HR Specialist will coordinate with the deployed PERSCO team and update MilPDS to reflect member’s deployed duty title and DAFSC effective the date the member arrives in the AOR.  They will also update the deployed rater if rater was unknown prior to departure. All updates should be completed as soon as possible but no later than 30 days after member arrives in the AOR. 3.9.1.2.1.  Duty Title format:  All Extended Deployment personnel duty titles will be standardized  to  reflect  the  Extended  Deployment  “duty  title/country”  assigned.    If space allows include the unit assigned.  EXAMPLE:  “Commander, 442 ECS/Iraq” or “Comm Mentor, GSU/Afghanistan.” 3.9.1.2.2.  When determining deployed rating chain, the rater should typically be the person who directly supervises the individual’s day to day activities.  The unit that AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 81 owns the Unit Line Number (ULN) will determine the rating chain (and will typically have TACON).  Raters may be in any United States or foreign military service or a civilian in a supervisory position and must be in a grade equal to or higher than the ratee.  In joint environments, an Air Force unit will be designated to have ADCON responsibilities. include  personnel management.    With    regard  to  evaluations,  this  involves  managing  the  evaluation program,  ensuring  evaluations  are  accomplished  on  individuals  on  extended deployments,  formal  LOEs  are  accomplished  on  deployed  commanders,  and decorations  and  informal  LOEs  are  processed    per  local  and  AFCENT  direction.  ADCON responsibility does not necessarily extend to writing the evaluations on those attached to the Air Force unit for ADCON purposes. responsibilities,  per  AFDD-2,   ADCON 3.9.1.3.  Upon Return from the AOR: 3.9.1.3.1.  The  home  station  CSS/HR  Specialist  will  change  the  member’s  rater, DAFSC,  and  duty  title  in  MilPDS  to  reflect  home  station  (post-deployment) information. 3.9.1.3.2.  The  home  station  senior  rater/commander  will  continue  to  complete  the commander’s  review/reviewer’s  (senior  rater)  portion  of  all  evaluations,  including those completed by the deployed rating chain. 3.9.1.4.  Senior Rater Responsibilities:  The senior rater matched to the ratee’s home station PAS code must perform senior rater duties.  Home station senior raters will prepare a PRF for promotion-eligible officers (officers will be on the home station senior rater’s Master Eligibility List (MEL) and will meet respective Management Level Review[MLR]). 3.9.1.5.  Interrogators  TR:    Officers  who  attend  the  Interrogator  training  program  will receive a TR upon graduation from the course.  The 314 TRS/CC will sign all TRs.  These TRs (officer and enlisted) will be updated in MilPDS.  The start date will be based off of the previous evaluation close-out date and the end date will be based upon the graduation date.  See Table 6.3., for update procedures. 3.9.1.6.  Annual evaluations that become due while in the AOR. 3.9.1.6.1.  Extended  (365-day)  Deployments:    If  an  annual  evaluation  becomes  due while  deployed  and  the  deployed  rater  has  had  at  least  120  days  supervision,  the evaluation will be prepared by the deployed rater.  If the deployed rater has not had 120 days supervision, the close-out will be extended out to where there will be 120 days supervision.  If an annual evaluation was accomplished earlier in the deployment, and there  has  been  at  least  60  days  but  less  than  120  days  supervision  by  the  time  the member departs, an informal LOE will be prepared. 3.9.1.6.2.  All others.  The evaluation will be prepared by the home station rater.  If there was not at least 120 days supervision before the departure, the close-out date will be extended until the member returns and the number of days supervision is 120 days.  Home  station  and  deployed  raters  are  encourage  to  work  together  in  preparing  the evaluation.  The deployed rater may have some significant inputs for the rating period. 3.9.1.7.  Home station and deployed commander will ensure a direct line of communication to the deployed rating chain is established to preclude evaluations not being completed at 82 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 the deployed location.  This is very important, as a majority of individuals on extended deployments  may  have  individuals  from  other  services  in  their  rating  chain.    The commander’s direct involvement in this area is critical and will preclude any problems. 3.9.2.  PERSCO Team Responsibilities:  The owning PERSCO team will be responsible for tracking the evaluations on all deployed personnel filling extended deployment billets. 3.9.3.  Deployed Rating Chain Responsibilities. 3.9.3.1.  Updates:    Ensure  the  home  station  has  updated  MilPDS  to  reflect  member’s DAFSC, duty title and deployed rater. 3.9.3.2.  Feedback:  Perform initial and mid-term feedback IAW Chapter 2. 3.9.3.3.  Evaluations:  The deployed rater (and additional rater[s]) will render an evaluation on an officer (OPR, AF Form 707), under the following circumstances: 3.9.3.3.1.  The  individual  is  assigned  to  a  legitimate  365-day  extended  deployment requirement. 3.9.3.3.2.  There has been at least 120 days of supervision. 3.9.3.3.3.  Upon completion of the extended deployment. 3.9.3.3.4.  If the individual is an officer filling a commander’s billet.  An OPR versus the formal Deployed CC LOE will be required. 3.9.3.3.5.  If  the  deployed  rater  changes  after  120  days  of  supervision,  a  CRO evaluation  must  be  completed.    NOTE:    Multiple  evaluations  may  result  and  are authorized under these circumstances. 3.9.3.3.6.  If ratee is returned early or the deployed rater changes prior to completing 120 days supervision, an informal LOE is required. 60 days minimum supervision is required. 3.9.3.4.  Evaluation Form:  For instructions on completing the AF Form 707, see Table 3.1. (OPRs). 3.9.3.4.1.  The deployed rating chain completes the evaluation through the additional rater’s comments/signature. 3.9.3.4.1.1.  AF Form 707:  Sections I through V. 3.9.3.4.2.  Provide  recommended  comments  for  the  reviewer  (senior  rater)  when applicable. 3.9.3.4.3.  Forward the evaluation to the home station rating chain for completion. 3.9.3.4.3.1.  AF Form 707:  Sections VI through VIII. 3.9.3.5.  Two GOs in rating chain:  Currently paragraph 1.4.11.4.2. prohibits multiple GOs from serving as evaluators on performance evaluations.  EXCEPTIONS:  see paragraph 1.7.17. 3.9.3.5.1.  Deployed GO Raters: Evaluation will qualify as a single evaluator and no additional rater will be required.  Complete rater block and forward evaluation to the home station senior rater. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 83 3.9.3.5.2.  Deployed GO Additional Raters: 3.9.3.5.2.1.  Provide recommended comments for the reviewer (senior rater) when applicable. 3.9.3.5.2.2.  Complete the additional rater block and forward to the home station senior rater/unit commander. 3.9.3.5.3.  Home station Rating Chain:  If one of the following situations apply, enter the applicable mandatory statement in the feedback comment section of the evaluation: 3.9.3.5.3.1.  Evaluations signed by a deployed GO and the home station senior rater is a GO, see paragraph 1.7.1.7. 3.9.3.5.3.2.  Evaluations  Signed  by  a  deployed  officer  who  out  ranks  the  home station senior rater, see paragraph 1.7.1.6. 3.9.4.  Evaluations required during deployments: 3.9.4.1.  Raters  will  submit  annual  evaluations  when  one  year  has  passed  (for  AFR, biennial if two years has passed) since the close-out date of the last evaluation and the period of supervision has been at least 120 calendar days, see Table 3.2., and Table 3.3. 3.9.4.2.  ANG and AFR officers ordered to EAD under Title 10, U.S.C., Section 12304 (200K call up), or 12302 continue to receive OPRs according to Table 3.1. and Table 3.2. Officers ordered to EAD under Title 10, U.S.C, Section 12301 (war or national emergency) receive evaluations under the RegAF list provisions in this instruction. 3.9.5.  Evaluations  rendered  in  the  combat  zone  or  at  noncombat  ports  and  MPSs.    All provisions of this instruction remain in effect, except: 3.9.5.1.  Authorities waive CRO evaluations resulting from the deployment to the combat zone,  provided  the  ratee  has  received  an  evaluation  within  180  calendar  days  of  the deployment date and the ratee's performance meets minimum standards.  For ratees not meeting  minimum  standards,  prepare  a  referral  evaluation  and  process  it  according  to paragraph 1.10. 3.9.5.2.  IMAs or those who are members of AFR mobilized units receive OPRs as required for other Airmen in the RegAF according to Table 3.2. 3.9.6.  Evaluator Requirements and Procedures for OPRs. 3.9.6.1.  Minimum grade requirements for senior raters and reviewers remain unchanged. See paragraph 1.5. 3.9.6.2.  Rater, additional rater and final evaluator requirements remain unchanged.  See paragraph 1.5.  The rater cannot be substituted for any reason other than those outlined in paragraph 1.7. 3.9.6.3.  If the OPR rater is also the reviewer, leave Section V, Additional Rater’s Overall Assessment,  blank  and  include  the  following  statement  in  Section  VI,  Reviewer’s comments block: “THE RATER IS ALSO THE REVIEWER.”  The rater digitally signs the rater, additional rater, and reviewer blocks (signature elements are optional).  If the OPR additional rater is also the reviewer, enter the additional rater’s comments in Section V, Additional Rater Overall Assessment, and include the following statement in Section 84 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 VI,  Reviewer’s  comments  block:  “THE  ADDITIONAL  RATER  IS  ALSO  THE REVIEWER.”  The additional rater signs both the additional rater and the reviewer block. 3.9.6.4.  “In-place” Additional Rater.  Commander’s may authorize the next evaluator in the rating chain (the additional rater’s rater) or “in-place” additional rater to assume the responsibilities  of  the  additional  rater,  when  the  additional  rater  is  unable  to  perform evaluator duties due to deployment.  When this occurs, Section V must include a statement explaining why the original additional rater did not prepare the evaluation (ex: additional rater deployed as of close-out date).  NOTE:  “In-place” additional rater is defined as the person responsible for the original additional raters normal day to day duties.  To endorse the evaluation, this individual must still meet additional rater grade requirements as defined in paragraph 1.5.2.2. 3.9.6.4.1.  When the squadron or group commander is deployed and is the additional rater  or  completes  the  commander  review,  the  “acting”  commander  on  “G”  series orders, may be substituted as the additional rater or commander’s review. An officer cannot serve as an "acting commander" and/or be identified or described as an "acting commander" on an evaluation.  Either the officer is a commander on G-Series orders or they are not a commander (whether by title or description).  In order to document an officer filling the position in the commander's absence, use examples such as "served as commander for 3 separate weeks" or "assumed commander duties for 6 months" or "filled in as CC 5 separate weeks" etc.   Vice  wing  commanders  may  assume  the 3.9.6.5.  For  deployed  senior  raters. responsibilities of the senior rater/wing commander for OES forms only  when placed on “G” series orders and designated by the Management Level (ML) as the senior rater. 3.9.6.6.  Comments  are  mandatory  when  there  is  significant  disagreement  with  the previous evaluator.  Evaluators must make specific comments to justify referral ratings. 3.9.7.  Referral Evaluation Procedures.  Use referral procedures in paragraph 1.10. with the following exception:  ratee comments on the referral evaluation must reach the next evaluator no later than 30 calendar days after receipt of the referral letter when the ratee is deployed in support of contingency operations.  Type, legibly hand-write, or print referral correspondence in dark blue or black ink using paragraph 1.10. as a guide. 3.9.8.  Routing Evaluations. 3.9.8.1.  Performance evaluations are due to the servicing MPS or personnel activity 30 days after close-out, and to the office of record 60 days after close-out. 3.9.8.2.  Forward evaluations directed under Table 3.2. or Table 3.3. for CSB use, to arrive at HQ AFPC or HQ ARPC (as appropriate) by the suspense date provided in the directing letter. 3.9.8.3.  Forward evaluations in a sealed envelope clearly marked, OPR DATA--TO BE OPENED BY ADDRESSEE ONLY. 3.9.8.4.  Alternate  routing  procedures.    Some  crisis  conditions may  result  in  temporary changes to routing procedures.  If this occurs, units will receive specific instructions. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 85 3.9.9.  Quality Control Review.  Quality control of the appearance of performance evaluations may relax, but the content and data contained must be accurate.  Evaluations prepared under wartime provisions may be handwritten. 3.9.10.  Interruption  or  Loss  of  Automated  Data  Processing  (ADP)  Support.    See  the  PSD Handbook. 3.10.  “FROM” Dates.  Use the “FROM” date on the OPR notice, but if different or incorrect, use the information below to establish the “FROM” date.  If the officer is: 3.10.1.  On EAD, and it is the first OPR, use the EAD date; or the day following the close-out date of a TR from a school that is 20 weeks or more. 3.10.2.  An ANG officer not on EAD and it is an initial evaluation, use the effective date of federal recognition in ANG or the day following the close-out of a TR from a school of 20 weeks or more.  NOTE:  Use AF Form 77 to cover any gap from the officer’s entry into non-EAD status to the “FROM” date of the first evaluation received in non-EAD status in IAW paragraph 1.14 and AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel Records System. 3.10.3.  An ANG officer not on EAD, and was assigned to an ANG unit from ARPC (ISLRS, NARS, ORS, or RRPS), use the date of latest federal recognition (Complete an AF Form 77 to cover a gap caused by insufficient supervision IAW paragraph 1.14 and AFI 36-2608). 3.10.4.  An ANG officer not on EAD and was assigned to an ANG unit from another state, use the date of latest federal recognition (the losing state will complete an AF Form 77 to cover a gap caused by insufficient supervision IAW paragraph 1.14 and AFI 36-2608). 3.10.5.  An AFR officer not on EAD and it is an initial evaluation or the officer has been reassigned from the IRR, use the date of assignment. 3.10.6.  An AFR officer not on EAD, but previously on EAD and concurrently assigned to training category A, B, or E on release from AD, use the day following the close-out of the last evaluation received while on EAD.  (Applies only to the first non-EAD-status evaluation.) 3.10.7.  An AFR officer not on EAD but previously on AD as RegAF and did not accept an AFR commission concurrently with release from AD, use the effective date of appointment in non-EAD status.  Applies only to the first non-EAD status evaluation.  Use AF Form 77 to cover any gap from the officer’s entry into non-EAD status to the “FROM” date of the first evaluation received in non-EAD status IAW paragraph 1.14. and AFI 36-2608. 3.11.  “THRU” Dates.  Never close-out an evaluation on or after the actual departure, retirement, or separation date of the rater or ratee.  If a departure, separation, or retirement date changes after establishment of the “THRU” date of an evaluation, it is not necessary to adjust the close-out date if it is no more than 30 days before the actual departure date.  Evaluations prepared and made a matter of record under the CRO rule remain valid even if the condition is later canceled. 3.12.  Non-Rated Periods.  In particular circumstances, non-rated periods may be authorized. The documentation  and/or  approval  authority  required  will  vary  depending  on  the  nature  of  the circumstances (i.e., for medical conditions, non-rated period is initiated by the Airman’s medical provider).  Those Airmen in or having been in military or civilian confinement, may lack to a degree, performance in their primary AFSC (dependent on the duration of confinement).  Non-rated  periods  due  to  medical  circumstances  may  include  some  degree  of  decreased  duty performance and/or behavioral effects resulting from these circumstances.  An Airman’s medical 86 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 circumstances  for  non-rated  periods  must  be  considered  individually  as  each  Airman’s circumstance is unique.  For example, there is no defined 'timeline' when a sexual assault victim becomes a survivor; every victim's recovery process is dependent on many variables, and therefore, time needed for recovery will vary.  Airmen may present a variety of symptoms after a trauma that may impact duty performance.  Some of these primary symptoms include effects on sleep and concentration.  Responses to a trauma will vary among Airmen because the nature and intensity of a current trauma occurs in the context of an Airman’s past history.  As a result, commanders, senior leaders, and supervisors must be aware of potential duty performance changes.  Likewise with post-traumatic stress, for Wounded Warriors, and Airmen requiring a recovery period as a result of  surgery,  invasive  treatment  (such  as  radiation  or  chemotherapy),  counseling,  and/or  other rehabilitative  treatments  and  services,  the  length  of  recovery  period  is  dependent  on  many variables (severity of diagnosis, prognosis, type and duration of treatment, reoccurring/multiple conditions/trauma, Airman’s support system, individual resiliency, dynamics in the duty section, family history, etc.).  Being TDY or deployed is NOT an example of a period that is non-rated. 3.12.1.  Medical  (physical,  physiological,  and/or  psychological  conditions;  hospitalization, maternity, and/or convalescence in excess of 80 days, including, but not limited to, Airmen in Patient Status) Documentation:  The Airman’s provider will initiate the recommendation for a non-rated  period  to  the  Airman’s  unit  commander  using  AF  Form  469,  Duty  Limiting Condition Report. (or or  Civilian  Director 3.12.1.1.  Unit  Commander/Military equivalent) Duties/Considerations.  The presumption will be in favor of the Airman requesting the non-rated period.  Counsel the Airman, directly, to ensure he or she is fully informed regarding the  reasonably  foreseeable  career  impacts  (re-accomplish  counseling  prior  to  60-day extensions).  Make every reasonable effort to minimize disruption to their normal career progression. 3.12.1.2.  Approval  Authority.    The  unit  commander/military  or  civilian  director  is  the approval authority and if they recommend disapproval of the request for a non-rated period, justification  must  be  provided  and  request  will  be  forwarded  to  the  member’s  wing commander/equivalent (may be delegated no further than vice commander/equivalent) for final approval/disapproval.  This may be accomplished on an additional memo or under a separate attachment. 3.12.2.  Sexual Assault (Unrestricted Report) Documentation:  The Airmen will submit the request,  using  memorandum  format  (see  example  in  Attachment  3)  to  their  unit commander/military or civilian director for approval.  The initial non-rated period, if approved, is 80 calendar days; additional periods (60-day increments) may be requested for the Airman’s recovery, and will be requested in the same manner.  It is prohibited to include comments on any correspondence (evaluation, evaluation notice, etc.) relating to or regarding the member’s filing  of  an  Unrestricted  Report  of  sexual  assault,  receiving  support  services,  and/or participating in the investigative process and/or judicial proceedings. 3.12.2.1.  Unit  Commander/Military Duties/Considerations.  See paragraph 3.12.1.1. 3.12.2.2.  Approval Authority.  See paragraph 3.12.1.2. or  Civilian  Director (or equivalent) AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 87 3.12.3.  Military or Civilian Confinement:  Non-rated periods of supervision, regardless of the number of days served,  may be  considered for  Airmen in military or civilian confinement (prisoner status), having served in military or civilian confinement during the reporting period, or those continuing to serve a term of confinement in a military or civilian confinement facility not  managed  by  the  Air  Force  Security  Forces  Center  (AFSFC).    The  ratee's  unit commander/military or civilian director will subtract periods of non-rated supervision as a result of confinement using the total days documented on Airman’s AF Form 2098, Duty Status Change, from the total number days of supervision, for all evaluations, with the exception of Directed  by  Commander  (DBC)  reports.    DBC  evaluations,  accomplished  to  capture  the egregious event(s) that resulted in confinement and will not subtract days of confinement (non-rated days) from the total number of days supervision. 3.12.3.1.  The  losing  unit  commander/military  or  civilian  director  for  those  courts-martialed Airmen, transferred to a long term confinement facility managed by the AFSFC, are  required  to  complete  a  DBC  report  (even  when  a  DBC  report  has  already  been accomplished),  to  close  out  the  day  the  courts-martial  is  adjudged,  encompassing  the courts-martial  results,  and  capturing  the  egregious  event(s)  that  resulted  in  the  courts-martial ruling of long term confinement (if the egregious event(s) are not already captured in a previous DBC or annual evaluation). 3.12.3.2.  Airmen in prisoner or confinement status as a result of courts-martial conviction, who  have  PCS’d,  and  are  gained  to  a  long-term  confinement  facility  managed  by  the AFSFC, do not require annual evaluations.  NOTE:  Airman awaiting publication of a Courts-Martial Order (CMO) will remain the administrative responsibility of the losing unit commander/military or civilian director until such time as the CMO is published and the  member  is  officially  transferred  to  an  AFSFC  managed  correctional  facility;  these Airmen  will  still  require  annual  evaluations  (as  applicable),  completed  by  the  losing commander/director. 3.12.3.3.  Airmen  undergoing  appellate  review  leave  and  awaiting  an  appeals  court decision are not required an annual evaluation, as they are still permanently assigned to a AFSFC managed confinement facility for reporting purposes. 3.12.3.4.  AFPC will complete an AF Form 77 for those Airmen who choose to remain in the Air Force following overturn of a CMO by a subsequent appeals court. The inclusive dates for AF Form 77s will be the day after the ratee’s last evaluation’s close-out date, through the day they were transferred back to present for duty status (the date the courts-martial is overturned).  The unit to which the Airman transfers following the return to present for duty status will take over performance evaluation responsibilities, beginning the day following AF Form 77 completion through to the next applicable annual or CRO close-out date. 3.12.4.  Notification.  Once the non-rated period is approved, the Airman’s evaluation notice will be annotated accordingly and forwarded to the Airman’s rater.  If additional non-rated periods are deemed necessary, notification will follow in the same manner. 3.12.5.  Reporting.  The rater will not consider, nor comment on, the Airman’s performance during a non-rated period, except as required IAW paragraph 3.12.3.  EXCEPTION:  The rater may comment on significant accomplishments (completion of ACSC correspondence) if requested by the ratee.  If the non-rated period covers the entire reporting period, enter the 88 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 statement: “Airman is not rated for this period: (date) through (date).  No comments authorized IAW AFI 36-2406” in Sections IV, V, and VI of the AF Form 707. 3.13.  Number of Days Supervision. 3.13.1.  Enter the number of days the rater supervised the ratee during the reporting period.  To compute,  use  the  “supervision  began  date”  through  the  “close-out  date”  to  determine  the number of day supervision. 3.13.2.  Do NOT deduct any periods of leave, TDY, absences or periods loaned out to other organizations.  EXCEPTION:  non-rated periods authorized IAW paragraph 3.12. 3.13.3.  On EAD an OPR is being written by the rater’s rater per paragraph 1.7., then enter number of days for which the evaluator had personal or written knowledge of the ratee's duty performance during the reporting period. 3.13.4.  A Non-EAD ANG officer’s OPR is being written by another rater per paragraph 1.7, then enter number of days the evaluator had personal or written knowledge of the ratee’s duty performance  during  the  reporting  period.    The  number  of  days  of  supervision  for  a  ratee assigned to a rater for a calendar year is 365, not the sum of unit training assembly and field training days. 3.13.5.  A Non-EAD AFR officer, then enter the number of days of supervision under the rater during the reporting period.  Deduct from the period of supervision tours of AD under other than the designated rater for which there is an LOE.  EXAMPLE:  If preparing an OPR to cover  the  period  from  1  July  to  31  December,  and  the  rater  was  first  so  designated  on  1 September and served in this capacity without a break to 31 December, and the ratee reported for training and duty for a total of 27 days between 1 September and 31 December, then the period of supervision is 122 days, not 27 days.  The rater is responsible for the accuracy of the number of days of supervision entry. 3.14.  ACA/Performance Feedback. 3.14.1.  ACA/Performance Feedback will be accomplished IAW Chapter 2. 3.14.2.  In Section  III, Rater certifies  ACA in this area by entering the date the ACA was provided during the rating period, this includes midterm ACA or any subsequent ACA sessions requested by the ratee.  If ACA was not accomplished, an explanation must be provided. 3.15.  Reviewer. 3.15.1.  The reviewer is the highest level endorser in the ratee's rating chain. The senior rater must be in the grade of at least a colonel or civilian equivalent (GS-15), or higher, serving as a wing commander or equivalent and designated by the ML. 3.15.2.  The reviewer will place an “X” in the concur or non-concur block.  Do not enter any comments in the reviewers block.  See paragraph 1.9. for disagreements. 3.15.3.  The reviewer may comment only under the following circumstances: 3.15.3.1.  If the reviewer disagrees with the evaluation.  The rater and additional rater are first given an opportunity to change the evaluation; however, they will not change their evaluation  just  to  satisfy  the  reviewer.    If  the  evaluation  remains  unchanged  and  the reviewer still disagrees, the reviewer marks the non-concur block and specifically states AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 89 why he or she disagrees in the space provided.  An AF Form 77 can be added if additional space is required. See paragraph 1.9. 3.15.3.2.  The evaluation is a referral, and the reviewer is the evaluator named in Section XI of the OPR, or the reviewer refers the evaluation.  See paragraph 1.10. 3.15.3.3.  The ratee is colonel or colonel select.  When the reviewer is not also the rater or additional  rater,  he  or  she  may  make,  if  desired  and  appropriate,  command  and/or assignment  recommendations  in  Section  VI,  reviewer’s  comments  block,  without  non-concurring with the evaluation.  Promotion recommendations and other comments are not allowed. 3.15.3.4.  If  the  reviewer  is  also  the  rater  or  additional  rater,  see  paragraph  3.9.6.3., mandatory comments. 3.15.4.  Single Evaluator only.  An evaluator must be an O-6 or a GS-15 (or equivalent).  If the rater is a SR, the evaluation must close-out at this level unless it is a referral evaluation.  The evaluator must meet both grade requirements and the evaluator requirements for each section of the applicable evaluation form. 3.16.  Prohibited Evaluator Considerations and Comments.  Certain items are prohibited for consideration in the performance evaluation process and will not be commented upon on any OES form.    Except  as  authorized  in  the  following  paragraphs,  do  not  consider,  refer  to,  or  include comments regarding: 3.16.1.  Inappropriate Stratification and Broad Statements. 3.16.1.1.  Stratification statements, when authorized, are not mandatory.  The omission of stratification does not constitute an error or injustice.  NOTE:  An evaluator may remove or change a stratification at any point during the drafting process of an evaluation. 3.16.1.2.  Stratification Quotes.  The use of stratification statements as quotes from anyone other  than  the  evaluator  endorsing  the  report  are  prohibited  unless  authorized  in  this instruction. 3.16.2.  Statements Outside the Scope of Responsibility.  Stratification and broad statements outside the scope of the evaluator’s responsibility or knowledge are prohibited.  Evaluators can only  stratify  personnel  within  the  confines  of  their  direct  rating  chain  and/or  scope  of responsibility (i.e.: within SRID).  A broad statement is one which implies knowledge of Air Force members not assigned within the evaluator’s realm of knowledge.  EXAMPLES: 3.16.2.1.  The communications squadron commander, as the communications functional on a base, cannot compare Information Management (IM) officers assigned to other units on the base. 3.16.2.2.  Functional  communities  at  higher  headquarters  cannot  compare  their  staff officers with members outside their immediate staff or across the Air Force. 3.16.2.3.  A MAJCOM/A1 cannot compare someone on their staff to all personnel officers in the command. 3.16.2.3.1.  “The  best  civil  engineer  in  the  business”  (outside  their  scope  of responsibility, because they do not have knowledge of all civil engineers). 90 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 3.16.2.3.2.  Similarly,  the  phrase  “top  5%  officer”  is  inappropriate  because  the evaluator does not have first-hand knowledge of all Air Force officers. 3.16.2.3.3.  (AFR Only)  Stratifications on evaluation reports regarding placement on Key Personnel Lists and other Development Team vectors are strictly prohibited. 3.16.2.4.  An evaluator cannot use the stratification of a higher level evaluator or quote a higher level evaluator.  EXCEPTION:  use of a senior rater stratification may be quoted if the senior rater is a signatory on the officer evaluation and does not have the opportunity to  provide  comments.    For  instance  a  squadron  level  commander  cannot  stratify  an individual  at  the  group  level.    Some  examples  of  prohibited  squadron  commander statements are below; however, these examples are applicable at all levels: 3.16.2.4.1.  “#2  of  72  Majors  in  the  group”  (out  of  squadron/cc’s  scope  of responsibility). 3.16.2.4.2.  “Group/CC says he/she is #2 of 72 Capts” (quotes are prohibited). 3.16.2.5.  An evaluator (must be a signatory) may stratify at a level below, as long as it is within his/her scope of responsibility.  For instance: 3.16.2.5.1.  A group commander can state: “2/50 Maj in the CE squadron,” “#1/4 Lts in the Ops Sq,” or “1/10 CGOs in the FSS.” 3.16.2.5.2.  The MSG commander can state: “#2 of 6 MSG Capts,” or “1/4 Lts in FSS;” however, he/she could not comment on the officers in an Ops Sq because that would fall under the scope of the OG commander. 3.16.2.5.3.  A  squadron  commander  can  only  stratify  within  the  squadron,  or  down (flight); not up (group or wing).  EXCEPTION:  The use of a senior rater stratification may be quoted if the senior rater is a signatory on the officer evaluation. 3.16.2.5.4.  Stratification for promotion selectees and frocked officers.  Evaluators for promotion selectees and frocked officers are authorized to stratify these officers with their  pinned  on  peers.    In  addition,  the  verbiage  must  specify  the  stratification  is amongst the affected grade; i.e., "O-6/O-6 selects", and if SRs choose to stratify with the pinned/frocked peers and use them in a denominator, SR may not include these officers in another denominator.  For example, if a SR has six pinned on O-6s, two O-6-selects, and four O-5s ... SR may say "#1/8 O-6/O-6 sels!" AND also may say "#1/4 O-5s"; this would be acceptable.  However, stating "#1/8 O-6/O-6 sels!" AND "#1/6 O-5s" would be prohibited.  This applies to officers selected for promotion to all grades of major through colonel. 3.16.2.5.5.  Stratification statements must be written in quantitative terms based on the following: 3.16.2.5.5.1.  Stratification  based  on  peer  comparisons:    Peers  (#1/10  Majors  or #1/5 Captains); Peer Group (#1/10 FGOs or #1/10 CGOs); Duty Positions (#1/7 Action Officers, #1/7 Sq/CCs); Aggregate Groups (#1/50 officers in my Group; #1 of my 50 officers; #1 of 50 majors in my 20 years of service); Additional Qualifiers (#1/4 Force Support CGOs; Best Major in my 32 years); Recognition Level (Wing CGO/yr, #1/200).  NOTE:  Stratifications that are vague or lack a qualified peer reference  group  are  prohibited  (Example,  although  not  all  inclusive,  would  be: AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 91 “#1/5”; “#1 of 30 officers”; “#1/50 officers” or “#1/200 personnel” as these do not identify a specific peer group). 3.16.2.5.5.2.  Stratification  within  a  rater’s  authority:    Senior  raters  may  only stratify within their rating chain (MAJCOM/CC may state “#1 of 500 Majors in the command”).    NOTE:    Stratification  outside  the  scope  of  the  rater’s  chain  of command, despite functional authority or responsibility, will remain prohibited (i.e. MAJCOM/A1  may  not  stratify  an  officer  as  “#1/75  38F  FGOs  in  this MAJCOM.”).  EXCEPTION:  Although outside the scope of the rater, quoting authorized stratification from deployed LOEs are authorized. 3.16.2.5.5.3.  Stratification quotes from senior leaders:  May quote stratification by senior leaders in the chain of command provided the senior leader is a signatory on the  evaluation  and  does  not  provide  comment  (Sq/CC  or  Gp/CC  could  say “Wg/CC’s #1 of 50 Majors”).  NOTE:  Stratification quotes from the ratee’s chain of command who are not a signatory will remain prohibited (MSG/CC may not state “OG/CC lauds as #1 LRO in my Group.”)  EXCEPTION:  If a Gp/CC is not a signatory on the OPR, a Gp/CC stratification is not authorized (unless supported by an award, “Ops Grp CGO Qtr”). 3.16.2.5.5.4.  Stratification in optional Deployed LOEs:  Stratification, assignment, command, and DE push statements in deployed letters of evaluation are authorized.  Deployed stratifications and push statements may be quoted in future OPRs and PRFs as long as stratification is not previously documented in the permanent record. 3.16.2.6.  When  stratifying  officers  on  OPRs  and  PRFs,  evaluators  will  not  consider completion/non-completion of non-resident DE if the officer is on the school select list (because they will attend in-residence), or Select/Candidate status.  Relative ranking among officers rated by the rating chain should be based on overall performance.  This paragraph does not preclude raters from making appropriate assignment and developmental education recommendations on OPRs/PRFs/RRFs, see paragraph 3.17.4. 3.16.3.  Inappropriate Promotion Statements or Reference to Grades/Positions Higher than the Ratee Holds. to that  are  pushes 3.16.3.1.  Promotion  statements the  next  higher  grade  are prohibited.  EXCEPTION:  Statements of fact (i.e. "filled a Lt Col billet") are authorized.  Additionally,  while  promotion  statements  are  prohibited,  an  evaluator  may  make recommendations  to  select  officers  for  a  particular  assignment,  DE,  Augmentation, Continuation, or Conditional Reserve Status. 3.16.3.2.  The term “Senior” on officer evaluations is prohibited.  This term is commonly understood as a euphemism for colonels and above, or to refer to members holding a higher grade than the ratee.  EXCEPTION:  On PRFs for lieutenant colonels being promoted to colonel, the term “Senior” may be used. 3.16.3.2.1.  When  used  in  conjunction  with  words  such  as  “officer,”  “position,”  or “leadership,”  the  term  “Senior”  constitutes  an  implied  promotion  statement  and  is therefore prohibited in officer evaluations. 92 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 3.16.3.2.2.  Referring  to  a  major  as  the  “Senior  Chaplain”  is  authorized;  however, referring to a major as “Performing senior leadership duties” is prohibited. 3.16.3.3.  Statements  acknowledging  an  officer’s  selection  for  promotion  during  the reporting period are acceptable.  EXAMPLE:  Maj Korte’s recent BPZ selection to Lt Col is right on target. 3.17.  Inappropriate  Recommendations  Referring to  Aviator  Continuation  Pay, Separation/Retirement,  Civilian  Employment,  Assignments,  DE/Professional  Military Education (PME) and Advanced Academic Degrees (AAD). 3.17.1.  Aviator Continuation Pay.  Comments on an officer's decision to accept or decline aviator continuation pay is prohibited. 3.17.2.  Separation  or  retirement  status.    Comments  referring  to  separation,  retirement,  or transfer  to  reserve  status  are  prohibited.    However,  comments  may  be  warranted  when  an officer displays a reluctance to accept responsibility, a negative attitude toward the job, and/or exhibits a decrease in performance that can be reasonably attributed to a pending separation or retirement.  Comments are limited to the behavior and not the fact the Airman is separating, retiring or transferring to a reserve status.  NOTE:  Although comments are mandatory, an evaluator may use the minimum bullets required IAW Table 3.1. 3.17.3.  Civilian Employment.  Comments about civil service jobs or other civilian occupations are prohibited unless it directly relates to the military position and their military performance.  Recommendations for civilian employment are prohibited. 3.17.4.  Assignment and DE Recommendations.  Assignment and DE recommendations on officer evaluations that are inconsistent with an officer’s current grade are prohibited.  The intent  and  philosophy  of  OES  is  to  recommend  an  officer  for  assignments/positions  and resident level of DE that reflect his or her potential. 3.17.4.1.  Evaluators may make one or more assignment recommendations in an officer’s evaluation provided the recommendations are both appropriate and realistically achievable for the officer’s current grade or current grade plus one.  The assignment recommendation may involve current grade plus one if the officer has completed or is currently completing the last reasonable career development step for the current grade.  EXAMPLE:  “Highly recommend for AFIT—then Joint Duty.”  NOTE:  AFIT can be used for an assignment push, however, it cannot be used as a DE push. 3.17.4.2.  The intent is to focus on what job or DE assignment the officer should be doing immediately after his or her current assignment.  Anything beyond the next assignment would be mapping out a career or making an implied promotion statement—both instances are contrary to the spirit and intent of OES. 3.17.4.3.  In  addition  to  assignment  recommendations,  evaluators  may  also  make recommendations for the appropriate level of in-residence DE on OPRs, PRF and LOEs (DE pushes are not authorized on TRs). 3.17.4.3.1.  Evaluators determine the appropriate level recommendation by considering the  highest  level  in-residence  DE  the  officer  has  already  completed  along  with  the eligibility  criteria for each level of in-residence  DE.  (For the purposes  of Primary Developmental Education (PDE) SOS is the method of completion). AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 93 3.17.4.3.1.1.  For lieutenant through captain, a PDE recommendation is appropriate until the officer has completed PDE in-residence. 3.17.4.3.1.2.  For a captain, once they complete PDE in-residence, an Intermediate Developmental Education (IDE) recommendation is appropriate. 3.17.4.3.1.3.  For a major, if as of the close-out date of the OPR, he or she has not already completed IDE in-residence and is still eligible for consideration, an IDE recommendation  is  appropriate.    However,  once  the  major  completes  IDE  in-residence or when he or she is no longer eligible for consideration, then a Senior Developmental Education (SDE) recommendation is appropriate. 3.17.4.4.  Raters cannot recommend officers for specific schools, including “joint DE;” only the terms PDE, IDE, SDE are authorized.  The appropriate venue for a specific school recommendation  is  through  the  annual  DE  process  on  the  PME/AFT/RTFB/Officer Worksheet. 3.17.4.5.  There is a fine line between an assignment recommendation and an overt, implied or veiled promotion statement.  When making an assignment recommendation on an OPR, there will be no reference to a higher grade, and it must be consistent with the officer’s appropriate progression of their professional development. 3.17.4.5.1.  Acceptable EXAMPLES: 3.17.4.5.1.1.  “Make  Capt  Cousins  an  MPS  Chief.”  (Appropriate  next  level  of progression). 3.17.4.5.1.2.  “Send Major Smith to IDE.” (Appropriate DE progression). 3.17.4.5.1.3.  On  a  Lt  Col  OPR,  “Make  him  an  Ops  Group  Commander.” (Appropriate next level of progression). 3.17.4.5.1.4.  “After SDE, assign to Air Staff.”  (Appropriate DE with follow-on assignment). 3.17.4.5.1.5.  For a major who has completed ACSC in-residence, or who is out of the eligibility window, recommendations for SDE would be appropriate, “Send to SDE.” 3.17.4.5.1.6.  For a captain who has completed PDE in-residence, or who is beyond the window of eligibility, an appropriate recommendation would be “In-resident IDE a Must.” 3.17.4.5.2.  Prohibited EXAMPLES: 3.17.4.5.2.1.  “Make Lt Triska an FSS Commander.”  (Inappropriate next level of progression). 3.17.4.5.2.2.  “Send Capt Brown to IDE after selection to major.”  (Reference to IDE  is  appropriate,  but  the  comment  “after  selection  to  major”  is  an  implied promotion statement). 3.17.4.5.2.3.  “SDE in 2008, Group Commander in 2012, and Wing Commander in 2015.”  (Goes beyond the scope of the next assignment). 94 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 3.17.4.5.2.4.  “Capt Phelps is ready to be a flying Sq/CC” and “Make Maj Knisley a group commander.”  (In both cases, the recommendations are clearly beyond the officer’s next assignment and are viewed as veiled promotion statements). 3.17.4.6.  DE  (in  residence  or  non-residence)  and  Advanced  Academic  Degree  (AAD) education for officers. 3.17.4.6.1.  Comments on OPRs or PRFs regarding completion of or enrollment in DE and AAD are prohibited.  Performance and special recognition comments on officers attending in-residence education and/or training will be documented appropriately on the AF Form 475, Training Report (see Chapter 6) and may be attributed when writing PRFs.  Evaluators may comment on an officer’s competitive assignment selection to programs  that  fall  outside  of  the  Developmental  Education  Designation  Board (DEDB), to include but not limited to Olmstead, Fulbright, Rhodes, School of Advance Air and Space Studies (SAASS), School of Advanced Warfighting Studies (SAWS), etc..  Evaluators will not, however, comment on an officer’s status on the schools list, selection for DE, and/or specific schools (i.e. ACSC, AWC, Joint, etc.) but limit their remarks to “PDE, IDE, or SDE” only.  NOTE:  An assignment recommendation for AFIT MS/Masters or PhD program is authorized. 3.18.  Extensions of Close-Out Dates. 3.18.1.  The  authority  to  extend  the  close-out  date  is  retained  by  HQ  AFPC/DP2SPE  for RegAF and HQ AFRC/A1 for AFR (may be delegated to ARPC).  The authority to extend the close-out date for ANG personnel is TAG in the state/territory to which they are assigned or NGB/HR for Statutory Tour personnel.  (This waiver authority will not be delegated, there are no exceptions).  AF/DPG (for EAD general officers) and NGB-GO (for ANG general officers) retains similar authority on AF Form 78.  AF/DPO retains authority on OPRs for colonels. 3.18.2.  Events  that  occur  after  the  close-out  date.    Extensions  are  only  granted  to  allow evaluators  to  document  negative  behavior  (i.e.  courts-martial  actions,  investigations,  etc.).  Extensions are not granted to document awards, achievements or completion/non-completion of any training.  Extensions on DBH and CRO evaluations are not authorized.  Extensions must be requested prior to, but no later than 30 days after the close-out date of the evaluation. 3.18.2.1.  Pending Administrative Actions.  If an incident or event occurs that reflect a departure from standards or derogatory in nature between the time an annual or initial evaluation closes out and the time it becomes a matter of record that is of such serious significance that inclusion in that evaluation is warranted, an extension of the close-out date  may  be  requested  by  the  unit  commander.    This  includes  completion  of  an investigation begun prior to the close-out date or confirmation of behavior that was only alleged as of the close-out date.  Commanders may request OPR close-out date extensions to  ensure  resolution  of  any  pending  administrative  actions  or  other  significant  issues.  Extensions will be granted to cover only the time necessary to complete actions, not to exceed 59 days. 3.18.3.  Send requests for extension to HQ AFPC/DP2SPE (or appropriate ANG/AFR office) via the servicing personnel office, who in turn will forward the request to appropriate office of primary  responsibility  listed  in  Table  1.1.    This  must  be  done  in  a  timely  manner,  and  a commander initiated email is acceptable. The request must include the following information:  AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 95 Name, Grade and SSN of ratee, evaluation “FROM” and “THRU” dates, desired close-out date (not to exceed 59 days), and a complete rationale as to why the extension is needed. Include all  applicable  pertinent  information  including  dates  of  investigations  during  the  reporting period and/or deployment dates (if applicable).  Incomplete requests will be returned without action. 3.18.4.  Approved extensions must be documented by placing the following statement in the feedback  section  of  the  AF  Form  707:  “Close-out  date  was  extended  IAW  AFI  36-2406, paragraph 3.18.”.  (T-0) 3.18.5.  When the approving authority grants an extension, only one extension, not to exceed 59  days  will  be  granted.    If  the  actions  cannot  be  finalized  by,  or  event  occurs  after,  the extended close-out date, the evaluation will be completed using the original close-out date.  If desired, the commander can then direct another evaluation be rendered at the 120-day point (60-day point for referral evaluations) to capture the incident. See Table 3.3. for AFR. 3.18.5.1.  Use the date approved by the appropriate waiver authority per a request for an extension of the close-out date. 3.18.6.  For AFR, if needed, adjust the close-out date on which the rater achieves the required number of days of supervision and points. 3.19.  Ratee’s Acknowledgement. 3.19.1.  The rater is required to conduct face-to-face (End-of-Reporting Period) feedback in conjunction with presenting the evaluation to the ratee IAW Table 2.1.  The OPR serves as the feedback form. An ACA form is not required.  Electronic routing of the form does not excuse the rater from providing face-to-face feedback.  Only in situations where face-to-face feedback is not feasible, will feedback be conducted either by telephone or electronically.  The rater should first attempt to call the ratee and conduct the feedback via telephone.  If that option is not available, the rater may provide clear, detailed feedback to the ratee via email, using a read receipt to verify the feedback was received and read. 3.19.2.  The ratee’s signature in the acknowledgment block does not constitute concurrence or non-concurrence  of  the  content  and/or  rating  of  the  evaluation.    The  signature  is  to acknowledge receipt only. 3.19.3.  The ratee’s signature will be obtained after the reviewer has signed.  In cases where an Air  Force  Advisor  or  Acquisition/Functional  Examiner  signature  is  required,  ratee acknowledgment will occur after the advisor or examiner review. 3.19.4.  The ratee must acknowledge receipt of the evaluation prior to the evaluation becoming a matter of record unless the ratee refuses or is unable to sign.  The ratee will review and verify all dates, markings and comments on the form.  Significant discrepancies and administrative errors can be addressed at this time, and corrected if agreed by all parties, before the evaluation becomes a matter of record.  This is not to be interpreted to mean the ratee can refuse to sign if they disagree.  This is an acknowledgement of the evaluation not concurrence.  If evaluators do not agree to change the evaluation and the ratee wishes to dispute it, they should pursue the established appeal/correction avenues available to them as outlined in Chapter 10, once the evaluation is a matter of record. 96 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 3.19.5.  The rater will suspense the ratee three (3) duty days (30 calendar days for ARC) to sign the evaluation. 3.19.6.  In  cases  where  the  ratee  refuses  or  is  unable  to  sign,  any  evaluator  signing  the evaluation is authorized to select “Member declined to sign” or “Member unable to sign” from the drop down menu in  the ratee’s acknowledgment and sign the evaluation in the ratee’s acknowledgement block. 3.19.7.  For the purpose of signing evaluations, the term “Member unable to sign” indicates that the member does not have access to a CAC-enabled computer (i.e. convalescent leave, TDY  to  a  contractor  facility  without  government  computer  access,  deployed  to  a  location without computer access, in AWOL or deserter status, etc.). 3.19.8.  “Wet Signature Evaluations Only.”  Evaluators can type, handwrite or use the drop down option to annotate the evaluation when the ratee is unable or declines to sign.   AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 97 Table 3.1.

If ratee is attending training or education, see Chapter 6. 2.  Colonels selected for promotion to brigadier general receive evaluations IAW Chapter 7. 3.  If the OPR is already a matter of record and the event or circumstances that brought about the evaluation changes or no longer exists, take no action. The OPR is a valid evaluation and remains in the ratee’s records.  EXCEPTION: The CSS/MPS/HR Specialist updates referral OPRs that are prepared as a result of a PCS and files them in the ratee’s records regardless of whether or not the evaluation was a matter of record at the time authorities canceled or delayed an assignment. 4.  If a CRO occurs after the original annual date has passed but before the 120-day supervision period ends, the evaluation is closed out the day prior to the rater change, provided at least 60 days of supervision have been obtained. The reason for the evaluation remains “Annual.” 5.  Do not confuse CRO with change of supervisor. For officers on the EAD and ANG officers, the home station commander may authorize a change of reporting official to the TDY location if ALL the following conditions are met:  NOTE:  The senior rater matched to the ratee’s home station PAS code must perform senior rater duties. a.  Someone at the TDY location can perform normal rater duties. b.  The rater’s rater meets the requirements of paragraph 1.5. c.  The home station and TDY unit commanders have approved the change [the ML must approve inter-command changes]. d.  The home station commander assigns a new rater when the TDY ends. 6.  If the ratee is selected to fill a 365-day extended deployment billet a CRO evaluation must be accomplished provided there has been at least 120 days supervision. 7.  An evaluation is prepared on officers discharged from the ANG and reassigned to ARPC unless paragraph 3.4. applies. 8.  If ratee is an ANG officer (not on EAD) serving on an AD tour of at least 120 days, AD supervisor prepares the evaluation. 9.  CRO includes separation from EAD.  However, no evaluation is required when the criterion in paragraph 3.4. applies. 10.  For officers on the EAD and ANG officers, this includes placement on or removal from the control roster (Chief NGB; Office of Adjutant General; MAJCOM;wing, group, squadron, etc.). 11.  Do not prepare evaluations for periods of MIA, captured, or detained in captive status of less than 15 calendar days. If the ratee remains in one of these categories for 15 calendar days or more, prepare an evaluation under this rule without regard to the number of days of supervision. Close the evaluation on the day the ratee was placed in MIA, captured, or detained in captive status. These evaluations are as directed by HQ AFPC/DP3SP. 12.  HQ AFPC/DP3SP and USAF/DPO retain the authority to direct evaluations under this rule. Special evaluations covering outstanding duty performance are not permitted under this rule. 13.  If the current rater does not consider the referral comments in an LOE to be serious enough to warrant permanent recording, an OPR will not be prepared. 14.  The close-out date of the evaluation is the effective date the ratee is placed in record status 6, deserter and may only comment on the negative behavior. 15.  The commander may direct an evaluation for significant duty improvement only if the previous evaluation was referred due to substandard duty performance. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 111 Table 3.3.

Colonels selected for promotion to brigadier general receive evaluations IAW Chapter 7. 3.  If a rater change (CRO) occurs after the original annual date has passed but before the 120-day supervision period ends, the evaluation is closed out the day prior to the rater change, provided at least 60 days of supervision and 8 active/inactive points have been earned.  The reason for the evaluation remains “Annual.”  If this criterion has not been met, an informal LOE (formerly called “optional LOE”) may be accomplished. 4.  Do not submit a report when rater and ratee are ordered to AD together and the rater does not change. 5.  If the ratee is selected to fill a 365-day extended deployment billet a CRO evaluation must be accomplished provided there has been at least 120 days supervision. 6.  This includes placement on or removal from the control roster. 7.  Do not prepare evaluations for periods of MIA, captured, or detained in captive status of less than 15 calendar days. If the ratee remains in one of these categories for 15 calendar days or more, prepare an evaluation under this rule without regard to the number of days of supervision. Close the evaluation on the day the ratee was placed in MIA, captured, or detained in captive status.  These evaluations are as directed by HQ AFPC/DP3SP or HQ ARPC/DPTSE. 8.  HQ USAF/REP retains the authority to direct evaluations under this rule.  If HQ USAF/RE requires special evaluations on certain officers for selection board use, HQ ARPC/DPTSE furnishes ratee names to the MAJCOM along with appropriate suspense dates and directs submission of evaluations under this rule.  Special evaluations covering outstanding duty performance are not permitted under this rule. 9.  If the current rater does not consider the referral comments in an LOE to be serious enough to warrant permanent recording, an OPR will not be prepared. 10.  The close-out date of the evaluation is the effective date the ratee is placed in record status 6, deserter. 11.  The commander may direct an evaluation for significant duty improvement only if the previous evaluation was referred due to substandard duty performance. 12.  For IMAs, PIRR and PIRR Category E, the unit of assignment is responsible for completing the OPR.  13.  For IMAs, only the points accumulated under the direct supervision of the rater apply. Subtract from the IMA’s total any points accrued under the supervision of someone other than the IMA’s rater. 14.  Only include points since close-out of last OPR or TR and do not include Extension Course Institute (ECI) or membership points. 15.  If the member has not earned the required number of points, HQ ARPC/DPTSE may extend the close-out to meet the requirement. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 113 Chapter 4 ENLISTED PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS 4.1.  General Guidelines. 4.1.1.  See Chapter 1 for general processing guidance applicable to all evaluations. 4.1.1.1.  Do NOT deduct any periods of leave, TDY, absences or periods loaned out to other organizations.  EXCEPTION:  non-rated periods authorized IAW paragraph 4.8. 4.1.2.  Evaluation  ratings  are  used  to  determine  selections  for  promotions,  job  and  school recommendations,  career  job  reservations,  reenlistments,  retraining,  and  assignments.  Therefore,  evaluators  at  all  levels  must  use  caution  to  prevent  inflation;  it  is  important  to distinguish performance among peers and is a disservice to ALL Airmen when EPR ratings are inflated. 4.1.3.  Marking Ratings. “Wet Signature Evaluations Only.”  When electronic ratings (Xs) are not used, do not enter hand-marked ratings until signing the evaluation to prevent erroneous entry of ratings by other personnel.  When hand marking, use only reproducible dark blue or black ink. 4.2.  EPR Forms. 4.2.1.  AF Form 910, (AB thru TSgt).  When completing refer to Table 4.2. 4.2.2.  AF Form 911, (MSgt thru SMSgt).  When completing refer to Table 4.9. 4.2.3.  AF Form 912, (CMSgt).  When completing refer to Table 4.6. 4.3.  Who Requires EPRs. 4.3.1.  All enlisted personnel in the grade of airman basic through CMSgt who have at least 20 months Total Active Federal Military Service (TAFMS) or for ARC 20 months in service from Date Initial Entry Uniformed Services (DIEUS) as directed by Table 4.3. or Table 4.4. 4.3.2.  The Chief of Staff of the Air Force retains discretionary authority to render evaluations on an optional basis on the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force. 4.3.3.  Military/Civilian Confinement.  AFPC will complete an AF Form 77 for those Airmen who choose to remain in the Air Force following overturn of a Courts-Martial Order (CMO) by a subsequent appeals court.  The inclusive dates for AF Form 77s will be the day after the ratee’s last static close-out date (SCOD) evaluation close-out date, through the day they were transferred back to present for duty status (the date the courts-martial is overturned).  The unit to which the Airman transfers following the return to present for duty status will take over performance evaluation responsibilities, beginning the day following AF Form 77 completion through to the applicable annual SCOD. 4.3.4.  Separation/Retirement  of  Enlisted  Personnel  (applicable  to  RegAF  and  ARC personnel). 4.3.4.1.  Evaluations are mandatory, regardless of separation or retirement status, provided the member has not officially separated or retired as of their applicable current, or projected grade’s SCOD.  EXAMPLE:  A MSgt with an effective date of retirement of 1 October, would require an evaluation on the MSgt static close-out date of 30 September, regardless 114 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 of if the member is on terminal leave, as they are not officially retired from the Air Force, until 1 October. 4.3.4.1.1.  For retirements (only):  An evaluation is mandatory; however, the rater may choose to or not to provide written performance comments on the evaluation as outlined below. 4.3.4.1.1.1.  If the rater chooses to write comments on an evaluation, the comments are written (regardless of whether the ratee wants the comments to be written or not) and the evaluation will close-out on the ratee’s applicable SCOD. 4.3.4.1.1.2.  If the rater does not want to provide written performance comments on an evaluation, the unit commander (for an enlisted ratee in the rank of AB thru SMSgt), or the senior rater (for CMSgts), will decide whether comments will be written. 4.3.4.1.1.3.  If the commander is the rater and does not want to provide written performance  comments  and  the  ratee  has  requested  them,  the  senior  rater  will decide whether comments will be written. 4.3.4.1.1.4.  If neither the rater nor ratee want written comments on the evaluation, the  commander/senior  rater  (as  applicable)  may  direct  written  comments  be included on an evaluation. 4.3.4.1.1.5.  In cases where written performance comments will not be included, the applicable evaluation form must still be completed on the SCOD, and must include  performance  assessment  ratings  and  the  following  mandatory  statement will be entered in every section of the AF Form 910, Sections III (2.), IV (2.), V(2.), VIII (1.), and IX (1.); AF Form 911, Sections III (2.), IV (2.), VII, and VIII; and AF Form 912, Sections II and IV: “FINAL REPORT NOT RENDERED”.  All applicable  members  of  the  ratee’s  rating  chain  must  endorse  the  final  report  to include the ratee. 4.3.4.1.2.  For separations (only):  Evaluations are mandatory, regardless of separation status, provided the member has not officially separated as of their applicable current, or projected grade’s SCOD.  EXAMPLE:  A SSgt with an effective date of separation of 1 February, would require an evaluation on the SSgt SCOD of 31 January, regardless of if the member is on terminal leave, as they are not officially separated from Air Force until 1 February. 4.3.4.2.  If the member’s official date of separation or retirement is prior to the SCOD for their  current  or  projected  grade,  a  SCOD  evaluation  will  not  be  rendered,  however  an informal letter of evaluation is optional. 4.4.  Evaluations  not  Authorized.  Performance  evaluations  will  not  be  accomplished  on  the following: 4.4.1.  RegAF personnel with less than 20 months TAFMS and ARC personnel with less than 20 months DIEUS. 4.4.2.  Individuals who died on active duty.  EXCEPTION:  if the death occurred on or after the close-out date of an evaluation that was already being processed, it becomes an optional evaluation. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 115 4.4.3.  Commissioning Program.  Airmen who are enrolled in a commissioning program as of the SCOD.  NOTE:  If an Airman does not complete a program and is returned to enlisted service, a Directed by HAF EPR shall be conducted, effective the date of removal, by the commissioning  program,  documenting  the  performance  that  resulted  in  removal  from  the program. 4.4.4.  Airmen in prisoner or confinement status as a result of courts-martial conviction, who have PCS’d, and are gained to a long term confinement facility managed by the Air Force Security Forces Center (AFSFC).  NOTE:  Airman awaiting publication of a CMO will remain the administrative responsibility of the losing unit commander/military or civilian director until such time as the CMO is published and the member is officially transferred to an AFSFC managed  correctional  facility;  these  Airmen  will  still  require  SCOD  evaluations  (as applicable), completed by the losing commander/director. 4.4.5.  Airmen undergoing appellate review leave and awaiting an appeals court decision and still permanently assigned to a AFSFC managed confinement facility. 4.5.  When to Submit an Enlisted Performance Report (EPR).  4.5.1.  AF Forms 910 (AB thru TSgt), AF Form 911 (MSgt thru SMSgt), and AF Form 912 (CMSgt) (EPRs) for RegAF and ARC Airmen on Active Duty, see Table 4.3. 4.5.2.  AF Form 910 (AB thru TSgt), AF Form 911 (MSgt thru SMSgt) and AF Form 912 (CMSgt) (EPRs) for ARC Airmen not on Active Duty, see Table 4.4.  4.6.  “FROM” Dates.  Establish the “FROM” date if the member: 4.6.1.  Has  a  previous  evaluation  on  file,  use  the  day  following  the  close-out  date  of  the previous evaluation. 4.6.2.  For RegAF Airmen who have not had a previous evaluation, the FROM date equals TAFMSD. 4.6.3.  USAFA returnees:  If an Airman is removed from cadet status to enlisted grade the FROM date will be the EAD date. 4.6.4.  AFR:  Members who have not had a previous evaluation, use the member’s date of assignment to the ARC.  For SrA and below use the Date Initial Entry Uniformed Services (DIEUS). 4.6.5.  ANG:    SrA  &  below  who  had  not  had  a  previous  evaluation,  the  from  date  equals DIEUS.  SSgt through CMSgt who are transferred from any branch or component, the from date equals date arrive station. 4.7.  “THRU” Dates. 4.7.1.  Initial Reports. 4.7.1.1.  For RegAF the close-out date will be 20 months from the ratee’s Total Active Federal Military Service (TAFMS) provided the 20 month anniversary date falls between 1 Apr through 1 Dec each year.  For example, the ratee’s TAFMS date is 15 Feb 15, then the close-out date will be 15 Oct 16.  If the 20 month anniversary date is on 2 Dec through 31 Mar then the close-out date will be rolled-forward to the 31 Mar SCOD.  For example 116 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 the ratee’s 20 months TAFMS is 23 Dec, then the close-out date will be extended to 31 Mar.  NOTE:  If the close-out date is adjusted to 31 Mar under this paragraph the reason for the report is “Annual”. 4.7.1.2.  AFR:  The close out date will be 20 months from the ratee's Date Initial Entry Uniformed Services (DIEUS), provided the 20 months falls between 1 Apr through 1 Dec each year.  For example: the ratee's DIEUS date is 15 Feb 17, then the close out date will be 14 Oct 18. 4.7.1.2.1.  If the close out date is on 2 Dec through 31 Mar of the biennial SCOD cycle then the close out date will be rolled forward to the 31 Mar SCOD.  For example, the ratee's 20 months from DIEUS is 23 Dec 15, then the close out date will be rolled forward to 31 Mar 16. 4.7.1.2.2.  If the close out date is on 2 Dec through 31 Mar of the non-biennial SCOD cycle then the close out date will be the 20 months DIEUS date and will not be rolled forward to the next SCOD cycle.  For example, the ratee's 20 months from DIEUS is 23 Dec 16, then the close out date will be 23 Dec 16, there is not a 31 Mar 17 SCOD cycle. 4.7.1.3.  ANG:    Close-out  date  will  be  20  months  from  the  ratee’s  Date  Initial  Entry Uniformed Services (DIEUS) date provided the 20 months falls between 1 Apr through 1 Dec each year.  For example:  the ratee’s DIEUS date is 1 Apr 14, then the close-out date will be 1 Dec 15.  If the 20 months falls between 2 December through 31 Mar then the close-out date will be rolled-forward to the 31 Mar SCOD and the reason for the report will remain Initial.  Subsequent evaluations will close out on the appropriate SCOD. 4.7.2.  Annual/Biennial Reports. 4.7.2.1.  Reports for RegAF members: reports will close-out on the next appropriate SCOD unless selected for promotion.  Those on a select list will have their evaluation close-out on the appropriate SCOD for their promotion selected rank.  EXAMPLE:  The SSgt SCOD is 31 Jan, therefore SSgt evaluations will close-out on that date.  However, TSgt selects (SSgts with a line number) will have their evaluations close-out on the TSgt SCOD on 30 Nov. 4.7.2.2.  Reports for ARC members:  reports will close-out on the next appropriate SCOD.  If a promotion/demotion or transfer out of inactive/active status has occurred and the ratee will have more than 24 months (12 months for AGR) from the last evaluation and the new established SCOD for the new rank; a DBH report is required to close out the day prior to the status occurred.  EXAMPLE:   An AGR MSgt is promoted to SMSgt effective 1 Sep 16.  A DBH report will be required to close out 31 Aug 16 because the member will have more than 12 months from the last evaluation and the new established SCOD for the new rank. 4.7.3.  For  Directed  by  HQ  USAF,  NGB,  or  Commander  (MAJCOM,  wing,  group,  or squadron, as appropriate) the “THRU” date will be established by the following: 4.7.3.1.  Message Directed.  Use the date specified in the message directing the evaluation. 4.7.3.1.1.  MIA/Captured/Detained.  Use the date the ratee was placed in missing-in-action (MIA), captured, or detained in captive status. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 117 4.7.3.1.2.  Stripes for Exceptional Performers (STEP) or supplemental promotions.  If an Airman is STEP promoted or supplementally selected to the next higher grade and if completing an evaluation on the next SCOD in the new grade will create a reporting period of longer than one year, then a Directed by HAF (DBH) EPR must be completed with a close-out date effective the date of STEP promotion or the date which the results of the supplemental were released.  EXAMPLES: 4.7.3.1.2.1.  SSgt  McDaniel  was  supplementally  selected  or  STEP  promoted  to TSgt on 15 Apr 2016 and SSgt McDaniel had an EPR on the SSgt SCOD of 31 January  2016,  then  no  EPR  is  required  as  TSgt  (or  TSgt  select)  McDaniel  will receive an EPR on 30 November 2016 (TSgt SCOD). 4.7.3.1.2.2.  SSgt Snowden was supplementally selected or STEP promoted to TSgt on 10 Jan 16.  TSgt (or TSgt select) Snowden’s last evaluation was completed on the 31 Jan 15 SSgt SCOD and the next projected EPR is the 30 Nov 16 TSgt SCOD.  Since this creates a rating period of longer than one year, a DBH EPR is required with a close-out date effective the date of the supplemental release/STEP promotion date. 4.7.3.1.3.  Otherwise Directed.  Use the date as directed by the commander. 4.8.  Non-Rated Periods.  In particular circumstances, non-rated periods may be authorized. The documentation  and/or  approval  authority  required  will  vary  depending  on  the  nature  of  the circumstances (i.e., for medical conditions, non-rated period is initiated by the Airman’s medical provider).  During the reporting period, Airmen in a lengthy initial skills or advanced training environment may lack performance in the ratee’s primary AFSC as they are learning their job versus performing their job.  Those Airmen in or having been in military or civilian confinement, may  lack  to  a  degree,  performance  in  their  primary  AFSC  (dependent  on  the  duration  of confinement).    Non-rated  periods  due  to  medical  circumstances  may  include  some  degree  of decreased duty performance and/or behavioral effects resulting from these circumstances.  An Airman’s medical circumstances for non-rated periods must be considered individually as each Airman’s circumstance is unique.  For example, there is no defined 'timeline' when a sexual assault victim becomes a survivor; every victim's recovery process is dependent on many variables, and therefore, time needed for recovery will vary.  Airmen may present a variety of symptoms after a trauma that may impact duty performance.  Some of these primary symptoms include effects on sleep and concentration.  Responses to a trauma will vary among Airmen because the nature and intensity  of  a  current  trauma  occurs  in  the  context  of  an  Airman’s  past  history.    As  a  result, commanders,  senior  leaders,  and  supervisors  must  be  aware  of  potential  duty  performance changes.  Likewise with post-traumatic stress, for Wounded Warriors, and Airmen requiring a recovery period as a result of surgery, invasive treatment (such as radiation or chemotherapy), counseling, and/or other rehabilitative treatments and services, the length of recovery period is dependent on many variables (severity of diagnosis, prognosis, type and duration of treatment, reoccurring/multiple conditions/trauma, Airman’s support system, individual resiliency, dynamics in the duty section, family history, etc.).  Being TDY or deployed is NOT an example of a period that is non-rated.  NOTE:  ARC personnel upon transfer out of the Inactive Ready Reserve or transfer from RegAF, or ANG, or AFR to another component, must include non-rated periods on the  first  SCOD  evaluation  following  reentry/transfer.    In  such  cases,  the  rater  will  place  the applicable number of days in the appropriate AF Form, Section I, “No. Days Non-Rated”.  The total number of days non-rated will include all non-rated days from close out of the last report 118 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 through to the SCOD of the current evaluation.  In addition, the following mandatory statement must be placed in the first line of the rater’s comments in Section III (AF Form 910/911) and Section II (AF Form 912), “Member not rated for the period of ____ days due to being assigned to Inactive Ready Reserve, or transfer from RegAF, AFR, or ANG” (whichever is applicable). 4.8.1.  Medical  (physical,  physiological,  and/or  psychological  conditions;  hospitalization, maternity, and/or convalescence in excess of 80 days, including, but not limited to, Airmen in Patient Status) Documentation:  The Airman’s provider will initiate the recommendation for a non-rated  period  to  the  Airman’s  unit  commander  using  AF  Form  469,  Duty  Limiting Condition Report. (or or  Civilian  Director 4.8.1.1.  Unit  Commander/Military equivalent) Duties/Considerations.  The presumption will be in favor of the Airman requesting the non-rated period.  Counsel the Airman, directly, to ensure he or she is fully informed regarding the  reasonably  foreseeable  career  impacts  (re-accomplish  counseling  prior  to  60-day extensions).  Make every reasonable effort to minimize disruption to their normal career progression. 4.8.1.2.  Approval  Authority.    The  unit  commander/military  or  civilian  director  is  the approval authority and if they recommend disapproval of the request for a non-rated period, justification  must  be  provided  and  request  will  be  forwarded  to  the  member’s  wing commander/equivalent (may be delegated no further than vice commander/equivalent) for final approval/disapproval.  This may be accomplished on an additional memo or under a separate attachment. 4.8.2.  Sexual  Assault  (Unrestricted  Report)  Documentation:    The  Airmen  will  submit  the request,  using  memorandum  format  (see  example  in  Attachment  3)  to  their  unit commander/military or civilian director for approval.  The initial non-rated period, if approved, is 80 calendar days; additional periods (60-day increments) may be requested for the Airman’s recovery, and will be requested in the same manner.  It is prohibited to include comments on any correspondence (evaluation, evaluation notice, etc.) relating to or regarding the member’s filing  of  an  Unrestricted  Report  of  sexual  assault,  receiving  support  services,  and/or participating in the investigative process and/or judicial proceedings. 4.8.2.1.  Unit  Commander/Military Duties/Considerations.  See paragraph 4.8.1.1. 4.8.2.2.  Approval Authority.  See paragraph 4.8.1.2. or  Civilian  Director (or equivalent) 4.8.3.  Lengthy  Initial  Skills  and  Advanced  Training  Courses  (enlisted  only).    Non-rated periods  are  only  considered  for  initial  skills  or  advanced  training  courses  in  excess  of  20 continuous weeks (for example the 1-year AFIT program).  The following training courses do not qualify for use of non-rated: initial skills and advanced training courses that are under 20 continuous  weeks;  all  other  3,  5,  7  skill  level training  courses;  and/or  other  specific  skills training courses (e.g. field detachment training, flight requalification courses, pre-deployment training, etc.) for which the ratee travels TDY from home station, or TDY enroute. 4.8.3.1.  Approval Authority.  AFPC/DP3SP serves as the approval authority for courses requesting  consideration  for  non-rated  periods  of  supervision.    All  requests  must  be signed/submitted  by  the  applicable  training  course’s  ADCON  wing  commander/senior AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 119 rater. AETC courses of instruction will route their requests through 2 AF/A1, who will review, consolidate, and forward to AFPC for final approval. 4.8.3.2.  Comments:  Are required in Sections III and IV of the AF Form 911, and Sections III,  IV  and  V  of  the  AF  Form  910,  which  capture  academic  performance,  significant accomplishments  (such  as  grade  point  average)  or  negative  quality  force  indicators received during lengthy initial skills or advanced training courses, even if the period of training covers the entire reporting period.  A minimum of one bullet is required in each section.  However, comments are optional in Sections VII, VIII and IX of the AF Form 911, and Section VIII and IX of the AF Form 910.  When comments are not included in optional sections, enter the statement “THIS LINE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK” in the  applicable  comment  area.    EXCEPTION:    Referral  evaluations  will  require  the applicable referral comments in Section VII, VIII and/or Section IX of the AF Form 911, and Section VIII and/or Section IX of the AF Form 910 as required according to paragraph 1.10.  NOTE:  Training squadrons are prohibited from replicating bullets for use across multiple EPRs; comments must be unique to each trainee’s accomplishments and level of performance. 4.8.4.  Military or Civilian Confinement:  Non-rated periods of supervision, regardless of the number of days served,  may be  considered for  Airmen in military or civilian confinement (prisoner status), having served in military or civilian confinement during the reporting period, or those continuing to serve a term of confinement in a military or civilian confinement facility not  managed  by  the  Air  Force  Security  Forces  Center  (AFSFC).    The  ratee's  unit commander/military or civilian director will subtract periods of non-rated supervision as a result of confinement using the total days documented on Airman’s AF Form 2098, Duty Status Change, from the total number days of supervision, for all evaluations, with the exception of Directed  by  Commander  (DBC)  reports.    DBC  evaluations,  accomplished  to  capture  the egregious event(s) that resulted in confinement (for enlisted may only comment on the negative behavior) and will not subtract days of confinement (non-rated days) from the total number of days supervision. 4.8.4.1.  The losing unit commander/military or civilian director for those courts-martialed Airmen,  transferred  to  a  long  term  confinement  facility  managed  by  the  AFSFC,  are required  to  complete  a  DBC  report  (even  when  a  DBC  report  has  already  been accomplished),  to  close  out  the  day  the  courts-martial  is  adjudged,  encompassing  the courts-martial  results,  and  capturing  the  egregious  event(s)  that  resulted  in  the  courts-martial ruling of long term confinement (if the egregious event(s) are not already captured in a previous DBC or SCOD evaluation). 4.8.4.2.  Airmen in prisoner or confinement status as a result of courts-martial conviction, who  have  PCS’d,  and  are  gained  to  a  long-term  confinement  facility  managed  by  the AFSFC, do not require annual evaluations.  NOTE:  Airman awaiting publication of a Courts-Martial Order (CMO) will remain the administrative responsibility of the losing unit commander/military or civilian director until such time as the CMO is published and the  member  is  officially  transferred  to  an  AFSFC  managed  correctional  facility;  these Airmen  will  still  require  SCOD  evaluations  (as  applicable),  completed  by  the  losing commander/director. 120 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 4.8.4.3.  Airmen undergoing appellate review leave and awaiting an appeals court decision are not required an annual static close-out date evaluation, as they are still permanently assigned to a AFSFC managed confinement facility for reporting purposes. 4.8.4.4.  AFPC will complete an AF Form 77 for those Airmen who choose to remain in the Air Force following overturn of a CMO by a subsequent appeals court. The inclusive dates for AF Form 77s will be the day after the ratee’s last static close-out date evaluation thru date, through the day they were transferred back to present for duty status (the date the courts-martial is overturned).  The unit to which the Airman transfers following the return to present for duty  status will take over performance  evaluation  responsibilities, beginning the day following  AF Form 77  completion through to the applicable annual SCOD. 4.8.5.  Notification.  Once the non-rated period is approved, the Airman’s evaluation notice will be annotated accordingly and forwarded to the Airman’s rater.  If additional non-rated periods are deemed necessary, notification will follow in the same manner. 4.8.6.  Reporting.  The rater will not consider, nor comment on, the Airman’s performance during a non-rated period, except as required IAW paragraphs 4.8.3. and 4.8.4.  EXCEPTION:  The rater may comment on significant accomplishments (such as completion of CCAF degree) if requested by the ratee.  If the non-rated period covers the entire reporting period (exception as required IAW paragraph 4.8.3. and 4.8.4.), enter the statement: “Airman is not rated for this period: (date) through (date).  No comments authorized IAW AFI 36-2406” in Sections III, IV, and V of the AF Form 910; or Sections III and IV of the AF Form 911; and enter “THIS SECTION NOT USED” in Sections VIII and IX of the AF Form 910 or Sections VII, VIII, and IX of the AF Form 911. 4.9.  Number of Days Supervision. 4.9.1.  Enter the number of days the rater supervised the ratee during the reporting period.  To compute,  use  the  “supervision  began  date”  through  the  “close-out  date”  to  determine  the number of days of supervision. 4.9.2.  Do NOT deduct any periods of leave, TDY, absences or periods loaned out to other organizations.  EXCEPTION:  Non-rated periods authorized IAW paragraph 4.8. 4.9.3.  On an EPR being written by the rater’s rater per paragraph 1.7., then enter number of days for which the evaluator had personal or written knowledge of the ratee's duty performance during the reporting period. 4.10.  Completing Evaluations.  The rater will evaluate how well the ratee performed during the rating period by completing this section of the AF Form 910/911/912; however, the additional evaluators  will  review  evaluations  to  ensure  ratings  accurately  describe  performance  and comments  are  compatible  with/support  the  performance  assessment  rating.    They  must  return evaluations with unsupported statements for additional information or reconsideration of ratings (see paragraph 1.9 for disagreements); however, no evaluator may coerce another into changing their comments or ratings unless they are missing mandatory comments (paragraph 1.11) or the evaluation includes prohibited comments (paragraph 1.12).  (T-0).  AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 121 4.11.  Promotion  Time-In-Grade  (TIG)/Time-In-Service  (TIS)  Eligibility  (AF  Form  910 only). 4.11.1.  This  block  will  be  marked  accordingly  based  on  TIG/TIS  eligibility  only,  not promotion eligibility. 4.11.2.  TIG/TIS is based on requirements outlined in AFI 36-2502 as of the SCOD.  The rater fills  out  this  portion  of  the  AF  Form  910  and  marks  the  block  “YES”  or  “NO”  based  on eligibility. 4.12.  Time-In-Grade (TIG)/Senior Rater Stratification/Endorsement Eligibility (AF Form 911 only). 4.12.1.  TIG/Senior Rater Stratification/Endorsement Eligibility.  Senior raters are restricted to stratifying the top 10% of TIG/TIS eligible MSgts or top 20% of TIG/TIS eligible SMSgts within their senior rater ID (SRID) and by component.  When determining the quota, normal rounding rules apply (.49 rounds down to the whole number and .50 rounds up to the whole number).    (NOTE:    Further  stratifying  ARC  personnel  by  status  within  component  is prohibited.).    For  a  senior  rater  stratification/endorsement,  the  ratee  must  meet  all  of  the following  minimum  requirements  as  of  the  close-out  date  of  the  evaluation  (except  as authorized by paragraph 4.13.4.2. due to forced endorsements): 4.12.1.1.  In the grade of MSgt/SMSgt. 4.12.1.2.  Meet the TIG eligibility requirements outlined in paragraph 4.12.5. and Table 4.5. Refer to AFI 36-2502 for ARC TIG/TIS promotion eligibility. 4.12.1.3.  Successfully  completed  the  SNCO  Academy.    The  SNCOA  requirement  is defined as successful completion of the SNCOA by correspondence.  Completion of the SEJPME does not fulfill this requirement.  EXCEPTION:  Airmen who have completed SNCOA in-residence prior to the implementation of the DL courses are not required to complete the DL courses to meet this requirement and will be considered complete. 4.12.1.4.  Successfully met all the Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) degree requirements as of the close-out date of the evaluation. degree is 4.12.1.4.1.  The CCAF requirement is defined as having been successfully met when the required course/CLEP/DANTES/etc. is not sufficient. 4.12.1.4.2.  Any CCAF degree may fill this requirement . Degrees received outside the CCAF do not fulfill this requirement, (i.e. A.A., B.S., M.A., Ph.D., etc.). conferred/awarded.   Completing the last 4.12.2.  A  senior  rater  will  endorse  a  non-TIG  eligible  evaluation  only  when  one  of  the following apply: 4.12.2.1.  When the senior rater is the rater whether or not the ratee is TIG/TIS eligible or has completed the minimum requirements for senior rater stratification/endorsement.  In this case, the SR will mark the “Forced Endorsement” box in Section IX block 1A of the AF Form 911. 4.12.2.2.  When the senior rater is the evaluator named in a referral memorandum. 4.12.2.3.  When the deputy evaluator does not qualify as a single evaluator. 122 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 4.12.3.  A senior rater stratification/endorsement is not automatic or mandatory even if the member is TIG/TIS eligible and has met the requirements in paragraph 4.12.1.  The decision to forward the evaluation for SR stratification/endorsement is determined by the evaluator who is eligible to close-out the evaluation; and each level thereafter, without necessarily going to the SR.  NOTE:  Blanket or locally developed policies restricting level of endorsement are strictly prohibited.  Each evaluation will be reviewed on its own merit to determine level of endorsement.    EXAMPLE:    No  organization  may  establish  a  "policy"  directing  the  final evaluator on MSgt/SMSgt selectee (or any non TIG eligible) evaluation be restricted to the Intermediate Evaluator simply based on TIG eligibility. if the  ratee 4.12.3.1.  The unit commander who meets the grade requirements to close-out the report as  a  final  evaluator,  determines is  deserving  of  a  senior  rater stratification/endorsement and forwards the report to the next level final evaluator.  The deputy evaluator (the first O-6 in the ratee’s chain of command, up from the ratee to the SR) may determine the report does not warrant senior rater stratification/endorsement.  The deputy evaluator may then close-out the evaluation at his/her level, without forwarding the evaluation to the senior rater. 4.12.3.2.  If both the intermediate and deputy evaluators feel the ratee is deserving of a senior rater stratification/endorsement and the minimum requirements have been met, the evaluation is forwarded to the senior rater.  If the senior rater determines a senior rater stratification/endorsement is not warranted (i.e., the ratee is not in the top 10% MSgt/20% SMSgt of the SR TIG/TIS promotion eligibles), the senior rater is not authorized to endorse the report (unless required due to forced endorsement).  The report will be sent back to the first O-6 in the ratee’s chain of command, up from the ratee to the SR to close-out the report.  In cases where there is no O-6/GS-15 between the ratee and the senior rater, the report will be returned to an officer with a minimum grade of O-4/GS-12 who works for and is rated by the senior rater.  The level of endorsement below Senior Rater is not a weighted factor and should not be considered positively or negatively with regard to level of performance or potential for promotion. 4.12.4.  If the member is not TIG/TIS eligible for a senior rater stratification/endorsement, the evaluation must be endorsed by, and the final evaluator will be, either the deputy evaluator or intermediate  evaluator  who  meets  the  minimum  grade  requirement  (except  due  to  forced endorsements). 4.12.5.  Determine  TIG/TIS  eligibility  for  senior  rater  stratification/endorsement  using  the formulas below.  See the TIG Eligibility Chart, Table 4.5. 4.12.5.1.  For  MSgt  Ratees  (RegAF  only).    NOTE:    Refer  to  AFI  36-2502  for  ARC TIG/TIS promotion eligibility. 4.12.5.1.1.  If close-out date is less than or equal to 30 Sep of current year, determine number of months TIG from Date of Rank (DOR) to 1 Mar of the next year following the evaluation close-out date.  If less than 20 months, then TIG Eligible is “NO.” If greater than or equal to 20 months, then TIG Eligible is “YES.”  All Airmen meeting a promotion board are required to have an EPR on file closed out within 12 months of the PECD. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 123 4.12.5.1.2.  If  close-out  date  is  greater  than  30  Sep  of  current  year,  determine  the number of months TIG from DOR to 1 Mar two years following the evaluation close-out date.  If less than 20 months, TIG Eligible is “NO”.  If greater than or equal to 20 months, TIG Eligible is “YES”.  All Airmen meeting a promotion board are required to have an EPR on file closed out within 12 months of the PECD. 4.12.5.2.  For  SMSgt  Ratees  (RegAF  only).    NOTE:    Refer  to  AFI  36-2502  for  ARC TIG/TIS promotion eligibility. 4.12.5.2.1.  If close-out date is less than or equal to 31 Jul of current year, determine number of months TIG from DOR to 1 Dec of current year.  If less than 21 months, then Promotion TIG/TIS Eligibility is “NO.” If greater than or equal to 21 months, then Promotion TIG/TIS Eligibility is “YES.” 4.12.5.2.2.  If close-out date is greater than 31 Jul of current year, determine number of months TIG from DOR to 1 Dec of next year following the evaluation close-out date.  If less than 21 months, Promotion TIG/TIS Eligibility is “NO”.  If greater than or equal to  21  months,  Promotion  TIG/TIS  Eligibility  is  “YES”.    All  Airmen  meeting  a promotion board are required to have an EPR on file closed out within 12 months of the PECD.  (T-0). 4.12.5.3.  For SMSgt promotion selects (RegAF only).  Promotion TIG/TIS Eligibility is based upon the SCOD of the EPR.  If the SCOD falls on the day of/day after the promotion public release date (to include supplemental promotions), individuals on the selectee list are  not  eligible  for  senior  rater  endorsement  on  that  evaluation;  as  they  were  SMSgt selectees on the SCOD.  Conversely, if the SCOD EPR closed out prior to the promotion public release date, the member is eligible for senior rater endorsement because as of the SCOD, they were still a MSgt and not officially a SMSgt promotion selectee. 4.12.5.4.  CMSgt and CMSgt selects.  The Senior Rater must endorse all CMSgt or CMSgt select EPRs. 4.13.  Final Evaluator’s Position and Single Evaluators. 4.13.1.  The final evaluator must be, at a minimum, an officer serving in the grade of O-4, civilian equivalent, (GS-12), or higher, but no higher in organization than the senior rater.  For CMSgt select and CMSgt (AF Form 912), the rater must be an E-9 (CMSgt or equivalent) or above; or an officer of the United States, or a foreign military service serving in a grade equal to or higher than the ratee.  The final evaluator must be the senior rater; final evaluator may not be delegated to a lower level evaluator.  NOTE:  For ANG AGR and non-AGR, the final evaluator must be at a minimum the full-time unit commander.  If there is no full-time unit commander, the final endorser will be the senior full-time officer serving in the grade of O-4, civilian  equivalent,  (GS-12),  or  higher,  but  no  higher  in  organization  than  the  senior rater.  EXCEPTION:  The CMSAF may endorse EPRs as a senior rater and may also serve as the final evaluator. 4.13.2.  Single Evaluator only.  An evaluator must be an O-6 or a GS-15 (or equivalent).  If the rater is a SR, the evaluation must close-out at this level unless it is a referral evaluation.  The evaluator must meet both grade requirements and the evaluator requirements for each section of the applicable evaluation form (EXAMPLE:  must meet both grade requirements as an O-6 [or equivalent/higher grade] and must meet the definition of a “unit commander/military or 124 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 civilian director/other authorized reviewer”).  An O-6, or equivalent, in and of themselves meets the grade requirement to serve as a final [deputy] evaluator on the AF Form 911, and/or as a final [senior rater] evaluator on the AF Form 911 and AF Form 912, provided they are designated  as  a  senior  rater  by  the  ML;  however  they  must  also  meet  the  necessary requirements as a  “unit commander/military or civilian director/other authorized reviewer” (see definition) to sign the entire evaluation as a “single evaluator”.  Also, see definition of final evaluator.  Single evaluators will enter “RATER IS ALSO THE ADDITIONAL RATER” in  the  additional  rater  comment  section.    Signature  elements,  to  include  the  signature,  are required in all sections of the evaluation regardless of whether there are performance comments included, or the evaluator has entered “RATER IS ALSO THE ADDITIONAL RATER”. 4.13.3.  An  additional  rater  who  meets  the  minimum  grade  requirement  may  close-out  the evaluation.  However, an official higher in the rating chain than the additional rater, may serve as the reviewer/final evaluator, if authorized.  In any case, the reviewer/final evaluator may not be higher in the organizational structure than the senior rater. 4.13.4.  Use the following to determine the final evaluator’s position. 4.13.4.1.  Senior Rater. Used when the final evaluator is the highest level endorser in the ratee's rating chain.  The senior rater must be in the grade of at least a colonel or civilian equivalent, (GS-15), or higher, serving as a wing commander or equivalent and designated by the Management Level.  For MSgt – SMSgt.  A civilian SR must be serving as a wing commander or equivalent, in a SR position designated by the Management Level and at least a GS-15. 4.13.4.2.  Senior Rater Forced Endorsement.  This block will be marked when the senior rater must complete Section IX, Final Evaluator’s Comments, of the AF Form 911, whether or not the ratee is TIG/TIS promotion eligible or has completed the minimum requirements for  senior  rater  stratification/endorsement,  due  to  rating  chain  or  final  evaluator requirements. 4.13.4.3.  Deputy Evaluator.  Is the first O-6/GS-15 evaluator in the ratee’s rating chain between  (up  from)  the  ratee  and  the  senior  rater,  regardless  of  the  organizational  duty position of the O-6.  In cases where there is no O-6/GS-15 between the ratee and the senior rater, then an officer with a minimum grade of O-4 who works for and is rated by the senior rater  would  qualify  as  a  deputy  evaluator  to  close-out  an  evaluation  which  is  not stratified/endorsed or TIG/TIS eligible.  Evaluators in the rating chain must not be skipped in order to garner a deputy evaluator endorsement by someone with a higher duty position within the organization/rating chain. 4.13.4.3.1.  When  the  rater  does  not  qualify  as  a  single  evaluator  and  is  the  unit commander/military or civilian director/other authorized reviewer, and works directly for the SR [rater’s rater/additional rater], the unit commander, etc. completes the rater's assessment area as the rater.  The SR completes the Additional Rater’s Comments, as the additional rater (to include allowing placement of the two optional bullets), and then the unit commander, etc. will complete the, Unit Commander/Military or Civilian Director/Other Authorized Reviewer’s Comments, (to include allowing placement of the optional bullet).  The SR will complete the Final Evaluator’s Comments, either as a forced endorsement or as the outright SR endorsement for those SNCOs who are promotion eligible and are receiving SR stratification/endorsement as a result of falling AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 125 within the SR’s top 10% of promotion eligible MSgts or top 20% of promotion eligible SMSgts (to include allowing placement of the optional bullet). 4.13.4.3.2.  Do not skip the O-6 squadron commander or branch chief in order to garner the O-6 group commander or division chief’s final endorsement as a deputy evaluator. 4.13.4.4.  Intermediate Evaluator.  An individual in the ratee’s  rating chain who works directly  for  deputy  evaluator  and  meets  the  grade  requirement  to  complete  the  final endorsement on the EPR.  For MSgt – SMSgt, a civilian final evaluator must be at least a GS-12.    EXAMPLE:    Unit  Commanders  not  in  the  grade  of  O-6/civilian  equivalent; MAJCOM section chiefs below the Division which are not in the grade of O-6/civilian equivalent. 4.13.4.4.1.  When the rater, additional rater, and/or unit commander/military or civilian director/other  authorized  reviewer  is  also  the  final  evaluator,  or  qualifies  as  a  final evaluator,  and  closes  out  the  evaluation,  they  will  complete  Section  VIII,  Unit Commander/Military  or  Civilian  Director/Other  Authorized  Reviewer’s  Comments, and Section  IX, Final Evaluator’s Comments, to include allowing placement of the optional bullet, in each corresponding section if they decide not to include performance comments. 4.13.5.  The individual who will be the final evaluator will ensure the proper final evaluator’s position block is marked prior to signing the EPR. 4.13.6.  Evaluators  with  Dual  or  Multiple  Roles  (This  paragraph  does  not  apply  to  Single Evaluators, see paragraph 4.13.2.).  When an evaluator is responsible for dual or multiple roles on the AF Form 910, 911, or 912, i.e., serves as the rater and the FD/unit commander/military or civilian director/other authorized reviewer (AF Form 910/911) or the rater and senior rater (AF Form 912), or when the additional rater is also the unit commander/military or civilian director/other authorized reviewer, and/or the final evaluator (AF Form 911), each section of the evaluation will be considered independently, and may include written comments authorized in  each  separate  section  of  the  evaluation.    When  an  evaluator  chooses  not  to  include performance comments in a section of the AF  Form 910/911/912, the evaluator will enter “THIS  LINE  INTENTIONALLY  LEFT  BLANK”,  in  the  applicable  section.    Signature elements, to include the signature, are required in all sections of the evaluation regardless of whether there are performance comments included, or the evaluator has entered “THIS LINE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK”. 4.14.  ACA/Performance Feedback. 4.14.1.  ACA/Performance Feedback will be accomplished IAW Chapter 2. 4.14.2.  In Section VII (AF Form 910), Section VI (AF Form 911), and Section III (AF Form 912) the rater certifies required ACA was conducted during the reporting period by signing.  If ACA was not accomplished, an explanation must be provided in the remarks block (AF Form 910/911/912).    126 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 4.15.  Forced Distributor, (Section IX, AF Form 910) Unit Commander/Military or Civilian Director/Other Authorized Reviewer, (Section VIII, AF Form 911). 4.15.1.  The review is performed by a military service member designated as the director of, or  in  command  of,  a  unit  (PAS  code[s]).    In  the  commander’s  or  director's  absence,  an individual  on  G-Series  orders  or  a  senior  official  within  the  unit  commander's  jurisdiction designated in writing by the unit commander or director, may complete this section provided in both cases, the designated individual is the next most senior ranking officer or civilian within the organization (e.g., deputy commander, operations officer, deputy director).  Individuals designated in writing to complete this section, in absence of the unit commander or director, may not use the title "commander" or "director" and they are to use their assigned duty title on the EPR.  A civilian equivalent, assigned to the position of director, or unit director, responsible for the unit (PAS code [s]), may also complete this section.  This section will be accomplished by the home station commander for all individuals assigned to 365-day extended deployment, regardless of the grade of the deployed rater and additional rater.  NOTE:  The FD as of the SCOD will sign all AF Form 910s on all Airmen assigned to their FDID, regardless of TIG/TIS eligibility.  If the FD appointed another officer/civilian to represent the FD at the EFDP, the signature authority is still the FD. 4.15.2.  The commander reviews evaluations to ensure ratings accurately describe performance and  comments  are  compatible  with/support  ratings.    They  must  return  evaluations  with unsupported statements for additional information or reconsideration of ratings.  However, commanders  may  not  coerce  an  evaluator  to  make  changes.    See  paragraph  1.9.  for disagreements.    NOTE:    First  Sergeants  are  required  to  review  all  EPRs  prior  to  the commander. 4.15.3.  The commander will mark the “concur” or “non-concur” block.  See paragraph 1.9. for disagreements. 4.15.4.  Forced  Distributors  or  Commanders/Directors  may  have  multiple  roles.    The  two signatures serve separate purposes, one as an evaluator regarding duty performance, and one as a commander regarding quality review.  If the FD/unit commander/director qualifies as a single evaluator enter “RATER IS ALSO THE ADDITIONAL RATER” in the additional rater comment section.  Signature elements, to include the signature, are required in all sections of the  evaluation  regardless  of  whether  there  are  performance  comments  included,  or  the evaluator has entered “RATER IS ALSO THE ADDITIONAL RATER”. 4.16.  Evaluator Considerations and Comments.  Certain items are prohibited for consideration in the performance evaluation process and will not be commented upon on any EES form.  Except as  authorized  in  the  following  paragraphs,  do  not  consider,  refer  to,  or  include  comments regarding: 4.16.1.  (AF Form 911)  Promotion Recommendations and Assignment Recommendations:  Written promotion recommendations are only allowed when a SNCO is TIG/TIS promotion eligible.  Written promotion recommendations may only be made by the final evaluator, and may  only  be  captured  in  Section  IX,  Final  Evaluator’s  Comments.    Written  promotion recommendations  by  anyone  other  than  the  final  evaluator,  or  in  any  other  section  are prohibited; i.e., written promotion statements made by the unit commander/military or civilian director/other authorized reviewer, additional rater, or rater are prohibited.  (EXCEPTION:  When the rater qualifies as a single evaluator and the ratee is promotion eligible, the rater may AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 127 include a written promotion recommendation in Section IX, Final Evaluator’s Comments.)  Written promotion recommendations on promotion selectee evaluations are prohibited as the ratee is ineligible for promotion.  Evaluators may only make promotion recommendations that refer to the ratee’s next higher grade.  Written assignment recommendations are authorized regardless of TIG/TIS eligibility (All AF Form 911s).  See paragraph 4.16.1.3.  Authorized examples are as follows: 4.16.1.1.  For a TIG/TIS promotion eligible MSgt (eligible for promotion to SMSgt), the final evaluator may make a promotion recommendation stating: “promote to SMSgt, then select  for  Flight  Chief.”   (Appropriate  because  it  could  be  the  next  eligible grade/assignment for a promotion eligible MSgt and the promotion recommendation was done by the final evaluator). 4.16.1.2.  However, for a MSgt who is not TIG/TIS promotion eligible, the following is prohibited,  "promote  to  SMSgt,  future  Command  Chief",  as  the  ratee  is  not  TIG/TIS eligible and as Command Chief positions are nominative positions held by Airmen in the grade of CMSgt.  Therefore an Airman must, at a minimum, obtain the rank of CMSgt and meet minimum eligibility requirements before becoming eligible for nomination to this position. 4.16.1.3.  Final  evaluators  may  also  provide  assignment  recommendations  in  their comments.  Similar to promotion recommendations, assignment  recommendations may only be made by the final evaluator (with the exception of the “Future Roles” section) and may only refer to the positions in the ratee’s current grade if not promotion eligible. If the ratee is promotion eligible (or a selectee), assignment recommendations may be made for positions in the current and next higher grade (if a selectee, next higher grade comments are limited to the grade selected to). 4.16.2.  (AF Form 910)  Promotion recommendations that are pushes to the next higher grade are prohibited.  EXCEPTION:  Promotion statements that are statements of fact (i.e, “selected for promotion BTZ”, or “STEP promoted to TSgt”) are authorized.  Additionally, pushes to commissioning sources are also authorized (i.e., Select for OTS, Selected for OTS, etc.). 4.16.3.  Performance  comments  regarding  Airman  serving  in  ceremonial/event  related positions  that  have  a  “title”  higher  than  the  rank  the  Airman  currently  holds  are acceptable.  EXAMPLES:  An Honor Guard SrA serving as NCOIC, Firing Team or NCOIC, Colors during a ceremony.  A SSgt serving as the First Sergeant of the Mess at a formal Order of the Sword Ceremony. 4.16.4.  Future Roles.  A recommendation provided by the  FD/unit commander/military or civilian director/other authorized reviewer (AF Form 910/911) or the senior rater (AF Form 912)  that  best  serves  the  Air  Force  and  continues  the  Airman’s  professional  development.  Future roles should follow the normal career progression for the ratee’s career field based on their respective Career Field Education and Training Plan and may include Developmental Special Duty (DSD) positions.  Future roles may not serve as a veiled promotion statement. 4.16.4.1.  An Airman that is TIG/TIS eligible or a selectee may be recommended for a future role in their current grade, projected grade, or grade in which TIG/TIS eligible to be promoted to.  EXAMPLE:  FD/unit commander can make a future role recommendation 128 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 for  a  TIG/TIS  eligible  TSgt  to  the  roles  of  Section  Chief  and  First  Sergeant,  as  these positions are commensurate with the grade of TSgt and MSgt. 4.16.4.2.  An  Airman  that  is  not  TIG/TIS  promotion  eligible  and  has  no  line  number may only be given a future role in the grade they currently hold. 4.16.4.3.  An Airman that has a line number may be recommended for a future role in their current grade or projected grade. 4.16.4.4.  An Airman that is TIG/TIS promotion eligible, however is not promotion eligible for other individual reasons (e.g. SNCO without CCAF or SNCOA, Article 15, etc.) can only be given a future role for their current grade. 4.17.  Inappropriate Comments Referring to Separation/Retirement, Civilian Employment, and Professional Military Education (PME). 4.17.1.  Separation  or  retirement  status.    Comments  referring  to  separation,  retirement,  or transfer  to  reserve  status  are  prohibited.    However,  comments  may  be  warranted  when  an Airman displays a reluctance to accept responsibility, a negative attitude toward the job, and/or exhibits a decrease in performance that can be reasonably attributed to a pending separation or retirement.  Comments are limited to the behavior and not the fact the Airman is separating, retiring or transferring to a reserve status.  NOTE:  Although comments are mandatory, the minimum bullets required IAW Tables 4.2, 4.6 or 4.9 may be used. 4.17.2.  Civilian Employment.  Comments about civil service jobs or other civilian occupations are prohibited unless it directly relates to the military position and their military performance.  Recommendations for civilian employment are prohibited. 4.17.3.  Enlisted PME Comments in EPRs. 4.17.3.1.  The  only  permissible  PME  comments  in  EPRs  will  be  those  referencing selections for an official PME award (e.g., John Levitow Award, Academic Achievement Award,  Distinguished  Graduate,  Commandant  Award  and  Leadership  Award)  or completion of Senior Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education (SEJPME/SEJPME II) courses (web based course).  Comments that reference award of in-residence course “team  awards”  are  prohibited.  (e.g.  the  CMSgt  Richard  L.  Etchberger  Team  Award).  Receiving  a  PME  award  is  a  significant  accomplishment  and  is  appropriate  to  use  in enlisted evaluations.  All other comments, to include recommendation for any other PME and selection for any other PME attendance are prohibited.  Comments referencing Air Force mandatory PME, residence or non-residence (Airman Leadership School, NCOA or SNCOA),  selection,  attendance  and/or  completion  are  prohibited  to  include  implied comments. 4.17.3.2.  SEJPME. 4.17.3.2.1.  Comments on completion of SEJPME courses are allowed for TSgts and above (except the SNCOA sister service equivalents [i.e., Navy SNCOA]).  Allowing SEJPME courses completion to be documented in evaluations will simply allow a valid Joint PME course to be appropriately documented in an Airman’s record.  AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 129 4.17.3.2.2.  SEJPME courses are in no way an equivalent to completion of the required Air Force PME and will not be reflected on SNCO promotion evaluation board briefs.  The  Air  Force  mandated  PME  (correspondence/in-residence)  remains  the  expected PME for all Air Force enlisted personnel to complete.  Completing any SEJPME does not fill the SNCOA requirement for senior rater endorsement consideration. 4.17.3.3.  Comments referencing non-completion of CCAF or SNCOA as the reason for absence of a senior rater endorsement are prohibited. 4.18.  Ratee’s Acknowledgement. 4.18.1.  The rater is required to conduct face-to-face (End-of-Reporting Period) feedback in conjunction with presenting the evaluation to the ratee IAW Table 2.1.  The EPR serves as the feedback  form.    An  Airman  Comprehensive  Assessment  (ACA)  form  is  not  required.  Electronic routing of the form does not excuse the rater from providing face-to-face feedback.  Only in situations where face-to-face feedback is not feasible, will feedback be conducted either by telephone or electronically.  The rater should first attempt to call the ratee and conduct the feedback via telephone.  If that option is not available, the rater may provide clear, detailed feedback to the ratee via email, using a read receipt to verify the feedback was received and read. 4.18.2.  The ratee’s signature in the acknowledgment block does not constitute concurrence or non-concurrence  of  the  content  and/or  rating  of  the  evaluation.    The  signature  is  to acknowledge  receipt  of  the  evaluation  and  to  certify  the  ratee  reviewed  the  personal information on the form. 4.18.3.  The ratee’s signature will be obtained after all other evaluator’s have signed.  In cases where an Air Force Advisor or Acquisition/Functional Examiner signature is required, the ratee acknowledgment will occur after the advisor or examiner review. 4.18.4.  The ratee must acknowledge receipt of the evaluation prior to the evaluation becoming a matter of record unless the ratee refuses or is unable to sign.  The ratee will review and verify all dates, markings and comments on the form.  Significant discrepancies and administrative errors can be addressed at this time, and corrected if agreed by all parties, before the evaluation becomes a matter of record.  This is not to be interpreted to mean the ratee can refuse to sign if the evaluation NOT concurrence.  If evaluators do not agree to change the evaluation and the ratee wishes to dispute it, they should pursue the established appeal/correction avenues available to them as outlined in Chapter 10, Correcting Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Reports, once the evaluation is a matter of record. 4.18.5.  The rater will suspense the ratee three (3) duty days (30 calendar days for ARC) to sign the evaluation. 4.18.6.  In  cases  where  the  ratee  refuses  to  sign,  any  evaluator  signing  the  evaluation  is authorized to select “Ratee refused” from the drop down menu in the ratee’s acknowledgment and sign the evaluation in the ratee’s acknowledgement block. 4.18.7.  In cases where the ratee is unable to sign, any evaluator will select “Not available” from the drop down menu in the ratee’s acknowledgment block and sign the evaluation in the ratee’s acknowledgement block. is  an  acknowledgement  of   This they  disagree  with the  evaluation. 130 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 4.18.8.  For the purpose of signing evaluations, the terms “Unavailable” or “Unable to Sign” indicates that the member does not have access to a CAC-enabled computer (i.e. convalescent leave, TDY to a contractor facility without government computer access, deployed to a location without computer access, no longer have digital signature capability, in AWOL or deserter status, etc.). 4.18.9.  “Wet Signature Evaluations Only.”  Evaluators can type, handwrite or use the drop down option to annotate the evaluation when the ratee is unable or declines to sign. 4.19.  Forced Distribution (AF Form 910 Only). 4.19.1.  Definition.    Forced  Distribution  is  the  restriction  on  the  top  two  promotion recommendations that a force distributor (see definition) can allocate on AF Form 910 for promotion eligible ratees, by grade. 4.19.2.  Forced Distribution Process. 4.19.2.1.  Promote Now (“PN”) and Must Promote (“MP”) recommendations are limited in number to ensure only the highest performing Airmen with the greatest potential to serve in the next grade receive “PN” and “MP” recommendations.  The FD or forced distribution authority is sending a strong signal that the Airman is ready for immediate promotion.  “PN” and “MP” allocation rates may vary by grade for each cycle.  The intent is to ensure those Airmen awarded a “PN” or “MP” receive a distinct advantage when competing for promotion.  FDs receive a share of “PN” and “MP” allocations based on the total number of TIG/TIS promotion eligible Airmen (by grade) assigned to a specific PAS code (unit) as of approximately 120-days prior to the established SCOD (the accounting date). 4.19.2.2.  Accounting Date (see Table 4.12).  On the accounting date (approximately 120 before the SCOD), AFPC will match eligible Airmen to their respective FD based on the Airman’s Date Arrived Station (DAS) in the personnel system (Effective Duty Date (EDD) for PCA actions).  After this date, the number of allocations is adjusted to account for Airmen who become TIG/TIS  eligible for promotion and for Airmen  who are still not aligned under the correct FD as verified and reported by the servicing FSS.  Adjustments are made until the SCOD.  On that day, AFPC determines the actual number of allocations and distributes them to FDs based on the number of eligible TIG/TIS promotion eligible Airmen for each FD’s particular PAS code(s).  No changes will be made to the number of allocations on or after the SCOD unless specifically authorized by HQ AFPC/DP3SP as an exception. 4.19.2.3.  Static Close-out Date (SCOD).  This is the date that all enlisted evaluations will close-out for a specific grade and is the date used to determine the final TIG/TIS eligible pool for senior rater stratification/endorsement and forced distribution allocations.  EPRs cannot be signed before this date. 4.19.2.4.  Enlisted Forced Distribution Panel (EFDP) (Small Units Only).  A panel that provides a mechanism to aggregate small unit eligibles to the SR or ML for promotion allocation.  The EFDP is comprised of the SR, who is the panel president (this can be delegated down to the vice commander only if the vice commander is not a FD); the FDs, who  have  promotion  eligible  Airmen  competing  for  forced  endorsement  promotion allocations on the panel; and an AF senior enlisted advisor, who is the CCM or Air Force SEL for joint organizations or organizations without a sitting command chief, and serves AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 131 in an advisory role to the EFDP only.  The EFDP may convene No Earlier Than (NET) the day  after  the  applicable  SCOD  and  after  receipt  of  the  final  Master  Eligibility  Listing (MEL).  EPRs meeting the EFDP cannot be signed by the FD, prior to the EFDP awarding “PN” and “MP” allocations. 4.19.3.  Large and Small Unit. 4.19.3.1.  A  large  unit  is  defined  as  any  organizational  structure  (Forced  Distributor Identification  [FDID])  with  11  or  more  TIG/TIS  eligible  Airmen  (by  grade)  as  of  the SCOD. Large unit "PN" and “MP” allocations are systematically determined based on the total population of TIG/TIS promotion eligible Airmen (by grade) in the FDID.  NOTE:  Aggregation of eligibles to the SR or ML EFDP is not allowed for large unit TIG/TIS eligible Airmen. 4.19.3.2.  A small unit is defined as any organizational structure (FDID) with 10 or less TIG/TIS  eligible  Airmen  (by  grade)  as  of  the  SCOD.    Small  units  “PN”  and  “MP” allocations  are  systematically  determined  based  on  the  total  population  of  TIG/TIS promotion eligible Airmen (by grade) in the FDID.  Small units do not generate allocations to be awarded by the FD; therefore, the small unit TIG/TIS promotion eligible Airmen aggregate up to compete at the SR or ML EFDP.  HAF/SAF/COCOM/MAJCOM FDs with 10 or less TIG/TIS eligible Airmen aggregate from the senior rater up to the ML EFDP.  The total number of promotion eligible Airmen from small units will drive the number of “PN” and “MP” promotion recommendation allocations awarded by the SR or ML EFDP; if there are 10 or less promotion eligibles following aggregation to the SR or ML EFDP, the SR or ML EFDP will receive an outright allocation of 1 “PN” and 1 “MP”.  NOTE:  EFDP consideration is not automatic; FDs determine which eligibles compete at the EFDP based on the Airman’s documented performance and their potential to serve at the next higher grade. 4.19.3.3.  Enlisted  forced  distribution  panels/proceedings,  may  occur  NET  the  day following each applicable grade’s SCOD, pending FD has the Final MEL. Any and all notional or pre-forced distribution proceedings, ahead of the completion of each grade’s entire  reporting  period  (e.g.  prior  to  1159  hours  on  the  applicable  grade’s  SCOD)  are prohibited. 4.19.4.  Forced Distribution of Students/Patients.  FDs have a separate FDID for in-utilization permanent party students and patients and will receive a separate allocation for their TIG/TIS promotion eligible student/patient populations, see paragraph 4.19.10.  NOTE:  Airmen TDY to school (less than 20 weeks) will fall under their home station FDID. 4.19.5.  Allocating Forced Distribution Promotion Allocations. 4.19.5.1.  Forced  Distribution  provides  an  opportunity  for  commanders  to  award promotion recommendations through forced distribution allocations to exceptionally well qualified  promotion  eligible  SrA,  SSgts,  and  TSgts,  to  be  effective  on  each  grade’s applicable annual SCOD.  Each FD authority’s  Promote Now (PN) and Must Promote (MP) selection opportunity is calculated according to a percent of the promotion eligible population based on TIG and TIS.  132 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 4.19.5.2.  The  following  is  provided  to  outline  mandatory  procedures,  restrictions,  and overall  guidance  to  FD  authorities  (unit  commanders,  senior  raters  and  management levels),  for  the  allocation  of  forced  distribution  promotion  allocations  via  small  unit organization roll-up to EFDP and large units. 4.19.5.2.1.  Large units (11 or more TIG/TIS eligibles) will receive their own forced distribution  promotion  allocations,  and  large  unit  FD  authorities  will  award  their allocations at the unit level. 4.19.5.2.2.  Small units (10 or less TIG/TIS eligibles) roll-up, compete at and receive promotion  recommendation  allocations  via  the  Senior  Rater  or  Management  Level (whichever is applicable) EFDP. 4.19.5.2.2.1.  Small  unit EFDP  procedures  are  established  by  Senior  Raters  and Management  Levels  (whichever  is  applicable)  using  the  guidance  within  this instruction.  Large unit procedures are developed by large unit commanders with the approval of the Senior Rater or Management Level (whichever is applicable), and must follow the guidance contained within this instruction.  Both large unit and Senior Rater or Management  Level  (whichever is applicable) EFDP procedures must be fully documented to ensure fair, equitable, and timely forced distribution promotion  consideration  and  must  be  IAW  the  guidance  in  this  instruction. Requests for clarification of procedures outlined in the attached instructions should be addressed to HQ AFPC/DP2SPE. 4.19.6.  Allocations.  AF/A1 determines forced distribution promotion allocations. 4.19.6.1.  Allocations are based on 5% of the total TIG and TIS promotion eligible SrA, SSgt and TSgt population for Promote Now; 10% of the total TIG and TIS promotion eligible SSgt and TSgt population for Must Promote allocations; and 15% of the total TIG and TIS promotion eligible SrA population for Must Promote allocations.  In accordance with the aforementioned allocation rates, AFPC provides the actual number of Promote Now and Must Promote allocations to each FD authority at either the large unit level or to the EFDP via the final master eligibility listing.  See Table 4.10 and Table 4.11 to view the allocation  tables  based  on  number  to  total  TIG/TIS  eligible.    The  tables  are  subject  to change, therefore FDs/EFDPs will utilize the allocations provided on the final MELs. 4.19.6.2.  Small  units  aggregate  or  “roll-up”  to  the  Senior  Rater  or  Management  Level (whichever is applicable) and may not aggregate to the group level.  EXAMPLE:  Medical Groups are typically divided into four squadrons and one group staff, with each squadron and the group commander having individual promotion authority (FDID).  The collective total of promotion eligible airmen will not be calculated by the group to form a large unit for the purposes of awarding forced distribution allocations, but rather as individual units.  In this example, any unit that does not qualify as a large unit would aggregate to the wing commander  as  the  senior  rater  and  the  Senior  Rater  EFDP.    The  same  holds  true  for SAF/HAF/COCOM/MAJCOM  organizations;  senior  raters  from  the  aforementioned organizations may not pool or aggregate their combined total of promotion eligibles under one or more senior raters in order to create a large unit.  EXAMPLE:  COCOM J-staffs (J1-J10) may not combine the promotion eligibles under a series of senior raters (J1, J2, J3, etc.) in order to create a large unit.  Any J-staff senior rater that does not outright qualify as a large unit would aggregate to the management level and the Management Level EFDP. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 133 4.19.6.2.1.  In cases where after aggregation there are still not enough eligibles from all  the  Senior  Rater  or  Management  Level  small  units  to  meet  the  11  TIG/TIS promotion  eligible  Airmen  requirement  to  earn  outright  Promote  Now  and  Must Promote  promotion  allocations,  the  Senior  Rater  or  Management  Level  EFDP (whichever is applicable) will receive an outright allocation of 1 “Promote Now” and 1 “Must Promote” allocation. 4.19.6.2.2.  When  there  is  only  1  eligible  out  of  the  Senior  Rater  or  Management Level’s total promotion eligible population, the Senior Rater or Management Level (whichever is applicable) will receive an outright allocation of 1 “Promote Now (PN)” and 1 “Must Promote (MP)”.  The Senior Rater or Management level (whichever is applicable) will determine if the promotion eligible’s record of performance warrants allocation of either a PN or an MP promotion  recommendation  and will award the appropriate  promotion  recommendation  accordingly.    In  cases  when  the  eligible’s record  of  performance  and/or  potential  to  serve  at  the  next  higher  grade  does  not warrant receipt of a forced distribution promotion allocation, the Senior Rater and/or Management Level is not required to award a PN or an MP allocation and may return the evaluation to the owning FD authority for award of a Promote recommendation. 4.19.6.2.3.  Allocations Not Used.  FDs are not required to use all earned allocations if they believe the performance quality and promotion potential of Airmen in their unit does not warrant the full share of allocations.  Additionally, redistribution or carry-over of allocations is strictly prohibited. 4.19.7.  Notifying Units. Units receive initial MELs identifying whether they are considered a large  or  small  unit  as  soon  as  possible,  but  not  later  than  the  applicable  accounting  date associated with each grade’s SCOD.  A final MEL will be forwarded to each unit following the applicable SCOD, finalizing the list of promotion eligible and non-eligibles.  Units should adjudicate  each  MEL  to  ensure  all  unit  promotion  eligibles  and  promotion  ineligibles  are accurately captured. 4.19.8.  Identifying Units.  AFPC will provide MELs identifying TIG/TIS and non-TIG/TIS eligible airmen assigned as of the accounting date.  The MEL identifies all airmen with an EPR scheduled to close-out on the applicable SCOD and those promotion eligible airmen who meet TIS  and  TIG  requirements  for  forced  distribution  consideration,  regardless  of  an  airman’s personal promotion ineligibility condition(s) (e.g., on the control roster, PAFSC skill level too low, undergoing Article 15 suspended reduction, etc.). See Table 4.12 for accounting dates. 4.19.9.  Promotion  Recommendation  Restrictions.    An  evaluation  containing  negative comments/derogatory information that causes the report to be “referred”, or evaluations with a performance assessment of “Met some but not all expectations” anywhere within Sections III, IV, V or VI, of the AF Form 910, are not authorized a promotion recommendation any higher than a Not Ready Now. 4.19.10.  Verifying Eligibility.  Using the unit’s MEL, FD authorities verify the eligibility of each individual to ensure they meet the TIG/TIS requirements for promotion to the next higher grade.  Only verify the TIG/TIS requirements and do not consider normal individual promotion ineligibility conditions.  This will ensure only those meeting the TIG/TIS requirements are considered and the FD authority receives the correct number of forced distribution promotion allocations.    NOTE:    FD  authorities  with  SrA,  SSgt,  or  TSgt  promotion  eligible  students 134 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 (student squadrons) or patients (patient squadrons) will receive forced distribution promotion allocations for their TIG/TIS promotion eligible student or patient populations separate from the forced distribution allocations for their TIG/TIS promotion eligible SrA, SSgt, or TSgt permanent party populations. 4.19.11.  Nominations.  Large or Small unit FDs are responsible for considering all individuals appearing on the unit’s final MEL and must “consider” all promotion eligible airmen.  FD will consider all individuals meeting TIG/TIS requirements, even if they are TDY or on leave. 4.19.12.  Large Unit Forced Distribution Promotion Recommendation Allocation Procedures. 4.19.12.1.  Large units (with 11 or more TIG/TIS promotion eligibles by grade) receive their  own  allocations  and  owning  FD  authorities  award  forced  distribution  promotion recommendations  at  the  unit  level.    Large  unit  force  distributors  must  adhere  to  the established  written  selection  procedures  within  this  instruction  and  any  additional procedures directed by their applicable Senior Rater or Management Level (whichever is applicable), to ensure forced distribution allocations are awarded based on fair, equitable, and timely promotion recommendation consideration. 4.19.12.1.1.  Following each grade’s specific SCOD, the unit will receive a final master eligibility listing denoting which Airmen are and are not TIG/TIS promotion eligible as well as how many Promote Now and Must Promote allocations are earned by the unit.  Large unit commanders (FD authorities) cannot exceed the promotion allocations listed on the final MEL. 4.19.12.1.2.  Large unit FDs are the sole decision authority for allocating promotion recommendations to their eligible population.  Large units will not hold scoring panels to derive a basic order of merit.  (NOTE:  Use of a rack-n-stack process or MLR scoring process is only authorized for use during execution of the EFDP and is prohibited for use in large unit forced distribution promotion allocation procedures.)  Large units may utilize the information and documents authorized in paragraph 4.19.12.1.5. only.  FDs are  encouraged  to  have  open  discussions  with  lower  level  leadership  (squadron superintendents,  flight  commanders,  section  chiefs,  etc.)  when  developing  their allocations. 4.19.12.1.3.  Once  selections  are  made,  large  unit  FDs  will  annotate  their  MEL  to identify the award of Promote Now and Must Promote promotion allocations as well as those eligibles awarded Promote, Not Ready Now, or Do Not Promote promotion recommendations, and then will sign the applicable listing, certifying their approved allocations. 4.19.12.1.4.  Large unit forced distribution promotion allocation selections may not be made any earlier than one calendar day following each grade’s SCOD. 4.19.12.1.5.  Information  Utilized  During  Large  Unit  Forced  Distribution  Process.  Large unit commanders will only review up to the last 3 years of evaluations in current grade (this includes:  the EPR being considered for forced distribution and the 2 years of  evaluations  immediately  preceding  it,  to  include  “selectee”  reports),  and  each eligible’s career brief.  The mandatory quality force review completed by commanders, in advance of the Forced Distribution decision, will acknowledge the ratee’s personnel record has been reviewed for quality force indicators during the period of the report.  AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 135 This review may include but is not limited to, the review of the nominee’s PIF and official fitness report considering the period of the report only.  The commander must have  a  discussion  with  the  member’s  supervisory/rating  chain  prior  to  making  a decision.  Lower level leadership (e.g. flight level or division level OIC, branch chief, or superintendent) may  submit a “push-note” to the unit commander in  advance of physical large unit proceedings.  Push-notes (limited to system space availability/two lines) may only convey the nominee’s relative standing among all Airmen nominated within the applicable organization structure (e.g. flight, division, or branch); all other comments on the ratee’s performance, or items not represented in the nominee’s EPRs, are prohibited (e.g. AF Form 1206 award packages, data sheets, matrices, etc.).  NOTE:  EPRs for all promotion eligibles, considered under forced distribution, must be signed by  the  applicable  rater  and  additional  rater  prior  to  any  formal  forced  distribution decisions (NET one day following the SCOD).  The results of the large unit forced distribution decisions will not change the performance assessment completed by the rater  and  additional  rater.    Changes  made  to  rater/additional  rater  performance assessment  ratings  and/or  bullets  on  reports  post-forced  distribution  decisions,  are strictly prohibited, with the exception of negative quality force indicators that occurred during the  reporting period that are brought to light following rater/additional rater signature. 4.19.13.  Small Unit/EFDP Forced Distribution Promotion Allocation Procedures. 4.19.13.1.  Small  units  (with  10  or  less  TIG/TIS  promotion  eligibles  by  grade)  are aggregated into one pool of eligibles to form the total EFDP eligible population.  The ADCON Senior Rater or Management Level (whichever is applicable) must adhere to the established  written  selection  procedures  within  this  instruction,  to  ensure  EFDP proceedings  are  conducted  fairly  and  equitably,  and  the  resulting  forced  distribution allocations are awarded based on fair, equitable, and timely promotion recommendation consideration. 4.19.13.1.1.  Under  a  wing  level  [Senior  Rater]  EFDP  construct,  squadrons,  group staffs, wing staff agencies could be classified as small units.  Under a Direct Reporting Unit or Field Operating Agency level Senior Rater EFDP construct, squadrons, group staffs, and directorates could be classified as small units. 4.19.13.1.2.  Under  a  SAF/HAF/COCOM/MAJCOM  [Management  Level]  EFDP construct, subordinate directorates with military  or civilian directors that are senior raters could be classified as small units. 4.19.13.2.  The following are the “approved” panel processes, to include any prohibitions. 4.19.13.2.1.  Small unit promotion eligibles are nominated by the unit FD authority to compete for award of a forced distribution promotion allocation at the Senior Rater or Management  Level  EFDP  (whichever  is  applicable).    The  maximum  number  of Promote Now and Must Promote promotion allocations the EFDP may award is based on the combined total number of TIG/TIS promotion eligibles from each small unit, by grade. 4.19.13.2.2.  Each  unit  may  nominate  up  to  the  maximum  number  of  available allocations.  EXAMPLE:  If the total combined number of SSgt promotion eligibles 136 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 from all small units is 28, the total number promotion allocations the EFDP may award is 4 (1 Promote Now and 3 Must Promote) based on a 5% Promote Now allocation and 10% Must Promote allocation; therefore, small unit FDID authorities may nominate no more than 4 promotion eligible SSgts to compete at the EFDP. 4.19.13.3.  EFDP President/Panel Member Delegation Authorities. 4.19.13.3.1.  The intent is for senior rater or management level (ML) to act as the EFDP president  and  conduct  the  panel.    Only  under  extraordinary  circumstances  may  the EFDP  president  responsibilities  be  delegated  to  the  next  senior  Air  Force officer/civilian (normally the vice commander).  If applicable, the vice commander, etc.,  will  delegate  the  FD  authority  for  the  small  unit  to  the  next  senior  Air  Force officer/civilian.    EXAMPLE:    MAJCOM/CV  is  appointed  EFDP  president  by MAJCOM/CC, the next senior Air Force officer/civilian will be appointed FD for the MAJCOM’s small unit FD. 4.19.13.3.2.  NAF/Center/Wing/DRU/FOA:  The vice wing commander, FOA or DRU vice commander/director or director of staff, will serve as the “small unit commander” only when there  are TIG/TIS promotion eligibles assigned to those respective staff agencies, under the direct authority of the commander (senior rater).  Senior raters will not serve in a dual-hatted capacity, where they act as both small unit commander and EFDP president during the EFDP.  Allowing the vice wing commander or director of staff  to  represent  promotion  eligible  staff  agency  airmen  at  the  EFDP  as  a  panel member gives the senior rater impartiality as the EFDP president. 4.19.13.3.2.1.  If  the  vice  commander/director  or  director  of  staff  has  been appointed as the EFDP president, he/she cannot be dual-hatted and also serve as a panel  member.    The  next senior  Air  Force  officer/civilian  will  serve  as  the  FD (panel member). 4.19.13.3.2.2.  NAFs/Centers will hold EFDPs at the NAF/Center level and not roll up  to  the  ML.    The  NAF/Center  commander/director  as  the  president  (unless delegated). 4.19.13.3.3.  HAF Staff/Major Commands (MAJCOM).  The commanders [MLs] may delegate  management  level  EFDP  president  responsibilities  no  lower  than  the  vice commander/deputy.    When  EFDP  president  responsibilities  are  delegated,  the  next senior  Air  Force  officer/civilian  (i.e.  director  of  staff)  will  serve  as  the  “small  unit commander” when there are TIG/TIS promotion eligibles assigned to the staff, under the direct authority of the commander (the ML).  MLs [themselves] or appointees, when ML EFDP president responsibilities have been delegated, will not serve in a dual-hatted capacity, where they act as both small unit commander and EFDP president during the EFDP.    Allowing  the  vice  commander  (or  appointee,  when  EFDP  president responsibilities are delegated) to represent promotion eligible staff agency airmen at the  EFDP  when  there  are  promotion  eligibles  assigned  to  the  staff,  gives  the  ML impartiality  as  the  EFDP  president.    EXCEPTION:    if  the  vice  commander  is unavailable due to  a prolonged (deployment, extended TDY,  etc.),  EFDP president responsibilities may be further delegated to the next highest ranking Air Force officer or civilian equivalent (no lower than Colonel). AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 137 (COCOM). 4.19.13.3.4.  Combatant  Commands   COCOM  EFDP  president responsibilities  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  COCOM  Air  Force  element commander (must be an Air Force Officer no lower than Colonel), unless the COCOM commander is Air Force and they specifically request to chair the EFDP proceedings on  behalf  the  COCOM.    COCOM [ML]  EFDP  president  responsibilities  cannot  be further  delegated  below  the  Air  Force  Element  Commander;  this  follows  basic  AF Doctrine.    EXCEPTION:    if  the  COCOM  Air  Force  element  commander  is unavailable due to  a prolonged (deployment, extended TDY,  etc.),  EFDP president responsibilities may be further delegated to the next highest Air Force General Officer.  When no other Air Force general officer is assigned to the COCOM, delegation may extend to the senior most Air Force colonel (for the EFDP in question only, not on a permanent basis).  Short absence (leave, routine TDY, etc.) do not qualify as a reason to delegate responsibilities below the AFELM/CC. 4.19.13.3.4.1.  For  joint  organizations,  such  as  United  States  Military  Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM), which may not have an Air Force General Officer or Air Force Colonel assigned, an exception to policy may be submitted to HQ AFPC/DP3SP.  The request must include detail the organization’s proposed EFDP process. 4.19.13.3.4.2.  For  joint  organizations,  the  FD  can  request  to  designate  the  next senior Air Force officer/civilian (no lower than Lt Col/civilian equivalent) to attend the EFDP.  This request must be approved by the EFDP president and documented writing. EFDP) and/or  Management (wing/FOA/NAF/DRU/Center 4.19.13.4.  Once selections are made, Senior Raters or Management Levels (whichever is applicable) annotate the applicable master eligibility listing, identifying those promotion eligibles selected to receive forced distributed promotion allocations and will return all individual evaluations to the owning FD authority for application of the awarded forced distributed  promotion  allocations  and  EPR  signature  by the  responsible  unit commander/military  or  civilian  director/other  authorized  reviewer.    Individual  Senior Raters Levels (MAJCOM/COCOM/HAF/SAF EFDP) will not sign evaluations in-lieu of the FD. 4.19.13.5.  EFDP forced distributed promotion allocation selections may not be made any earlier than one calendar day following each grade’s SCOD. 4.19.13.6.  Forced distributors will receive a MEL identifying eligible Airmen; if a small unit FD authority is not going to nominate an eligible to compete at the EFDP, he/she will annotate their MEL accordingly to include signature. 4.19.13.7.  Information  Utilized During the Enlisted Forced Distribution Panel Process.  Small unit commanders will submit the last 3 years of evaluations in current grade (this includes: the EPR being considered for forced distribution and the 2 years of evaluations immediately preceding to include “selectee” reports) and each nominee’s career brief.  The mandatory  quality  force  review  completed  by  commanders,  in  advance  of  the  EFDP proceedings, will acknowledge the ratee’s personnel record has been reviewed for quality force indicators during the period of the report.  This review may include but is not limited to, the review of the nominee’s PIF and official fitness report considering the period of the report only.  The commander must have a discussion with the member’s supervisory/rating 138 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 chain prior to making a promotion recommendation.  Commanders may submit a “push-note” only when the EFDP proceedings are held virtually and/or when nominee packages will  be  sent  to  panel  members  in  advance  of  physical  EFDP  proceedings.    Push-notes (limited to system space availability) may only convey the nominee’s relative standing among all Airmen nominated by a small unit commander; all other comments on the ratee’s performance,  or  items  not  represented  in  the  nominee’s  EPRs,  are  strictly  prohibited.  Commanders are  encouraged to prepare to  advocate for their respective  nominee(s) by seeking the counsel of their respective enlisted and officer leadership teams, prior to the EFDP convening.   NOTE:  EPRs for all promotion eligibles, considered under forced distribution, must be signed by the applicable rater and additional rater prior to any formal forced distribution proceedings (no earlier than one day following the SCOD).  The results of the EFDP proceedings will not change the performance assessment completed by the rater and additional rater.  Changes made to performance assessment ratings and/or bullets on  reports  post-EFDP,  are  prohibited,  with  the  exception  of  negative  quality  force indicators that occurred during the reporting period that are brought to light following the EFDP. 4.19.13.8.  EFDP Procedures. 4.19.13.8.1.  Physical or virtual panel.  It is up to the Senior Rater or the Management Level (whichever is applicable) to determine how to hold the EFDP based upon the nature of the organization’s structure.  Each panel member must be given the same amount of time and information to review.  When a Senior Rater or Management Level (whichever is applicable) chooses to hold a physical EFDP (i.e., in person), the SR or ML may  choose to provide nominee records  for review in  advance of the physical proceedings.    In  such  cases,  the  EFDP  recorder  will  ensure  all  EFDP  records  are available for preview by all EFDP members in a timely fashion, ensuring ample time to review records in advance of the physical EFDP proceedings. 4.19.13.8.2.  When a commander has promotion authority over two or more units, the eligibles are not combined and the unit commander complies with established large or small unit procedures based on each unit’s number of promotion eligible, by grade. 4.19.13.8.3.  EFDP  selection  folders  (electronic  or  otherwise)  may  only  contain  the current/considered  AF  Form  910,  the  2  years  of  evaluations  preceding  the  current year’s SCOD EPR (in current grade), the Forced Distribution Career Brief, and a “push-note”  IAW  paragraph  4.19.13.7.    Allow  Geographically  Separated  Units  to  use SharePoint, email or another automated program to transmit nomination packages. 4.19.13.8.4.  Destroy selection folders when no longer needed. 4.19.13.8.5.  Commanders  must  ensure  all  quality  indicators  are  accurate  before requesting the Senior Rater or Management Level (whichever is applicable) take action to downgrade the promotion recommendation allocated by the EFDP. 4.19.14.  EFDP Membership. 4.19.14.1.  EFDP President (Senior Rater or Management Level themselves).  A voting, scoring member of the EFDP.  He or she must be the Senior Rater assigned to the Senior Rater  Identification  (SRID)  or  Management  Level  (assigned  as  the  head  of  the AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 139 Management Level); for COCOMs this will be the Air Force Element Commander (the Air Force General Officer designated by the COCOM/CC as the AFELM/CC). 4.19.14.1.1.  The panel president will: 4.19.14.1.1.1.  Design  and  document  procedures  for  their  respective  EFDP  and perform administrative duties in connection with the EFDP proceedings. 4.19.14.1.1.2.  Ensure  all  members  understand  discussions  regarding  individual records or awarded recommendations; and discussions between panel members are not to be shared outside of the EFDP.  However, it is encouraged the FDs have open discussions with their Airmen regarding the EFDP process and how the panels are conducted. 4.19.14.1.1.3.  Ensure the consideration of all promotion eligible airmen nominated to  the  EFDP  without  prejudice  or  partiality  in  a  consistent,  fair,  and  equitable manner. 4.19.14.2.  The Senior Rater or Management Level may not delegate EFDP responsibilities to another senior official in the organization, except as detailed in paragraph 4.19.13.3. 4.19.14.3.  FD Authorities with members meeting the EFDP: 4.19.14.3.1.  Will represent the airmen they have nominated from their particular small unit. 4.19.14.3.2.  In extraordinary circumstances the FD can request to designate the next senior  Air  Force  officer/civilian  (no  lower  than  Major/civilian  equivalent)  to “represent” them at the EFDP.  If the next highest ranking official does not meet the required rank, then another FD within the SR structure may represent the organization (i.e., another squadron commander, group deputy, etc.).  The request must be approved by the EFDP president and documented in writing.  The FD will maintain all other FD responsibilities (i.e. signing EPRs and MELs). 4.19.14.3.3.  Small  unit  FDs  may  not  delegate  FD  responsibilities  to  another  party, unless the commander’s FD authority has been delegated to the next highest ranking officer  within  the  commander’s  organization  as  a  result  of  the  unit  commander’s prolonged (deployment, extended TDY, etc.) absence and not short absence (leave, routine TDY, etc.). 4.19.14.4.  Command Chief Master Sergeant or Air Force Senior Enlisted Leader serves in an advisory capacity to the EFDP and will not under any circumstances serve as a voting member during the EFDP process.  In organizational structures that do not earn a Command Chief Master Sergeant or Air Force Senior Enlisted Leader authorization (9E000 AFSC), the Senior Rater or Management Level (whichever is applicable), will utilize the senior most  enlisted  Air  Force  member  within  the  their  respective  organization,  as  a  panel member for the EFDP.  In cases where the Command Chief Master Sergeant or Air Force Senior  Enlisted  Leader  (9E000  AFSC)  is  unavailable  due  to  a  prolonged  (deployment,  extended  TDY,  etc.)  absence  and  not  a  short  absence  (leave,  routine  TDY,  etc.),  the “interim” Command Chief Master Sergeant or Air Force Senior Enlisted Leader, will serve in this advisory role.  140 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 4.19.14.5.  EFDP Recorders. 4.19.14.5.1.  Manage the flow of records to the EFDP members, review information for presentation to the EFDP, and advise the president and panel members on EFDP process and other administrative matters.  Primarily, they ensure EFDP proceedings meet all requirements of this instruction. 4.19.14.5.2.  Ensure  at  least  one  EFDP  recorder  is  present  during  all  physical deliberations. 4.19.14.5.3.  Not serve as a recorder on EFDPs for which they are being considered. 4.19.14.5.4.  Not serve as an EFDP member and a recorder for the same panel. 4.19.15.  Scoring. 4.19.15.1.  Records are scored on a best-qualified basis.  EFDP members will ensure that airmen selected to receive forced distribution promotion allocations are fully qualified to assume the next higher grade. 4.19.15.2.  The  Senior  Rater  or  Management  Level  (whichever  is  applicable)  may  use either: 4.19.15.2.1.  A “rack-n-stack” process by which each panel member rank orders (e.g. 1, 2, 3…) all records from highest to lowest, then combines all rankings to develop an order of merit, or… 4.19.15.2.2.  A panel or Management Level Review (MLR) scoring process by which EFDP records are scored, in 6 to 10 point increments. 4.19.15.3.  Scoring is based upon the material in each eligible EFDP selection folder only.  See  paragraph  4.19.13.8.3.    EFDP  members  are  prohibited  from  using  any  other document when scoring records. 4.19.15.4.  Panel  members  will  assign  each  eligible  a  score  (6  to  10  point)  or  ranking, reflecting  their  assessment  of  relative  performance,  leadership/followership,  and  the potential to serve at the next higher grade. 4.19.15.5.  Scoring may be made in advance and without benefit of discussion during a records review or in person in a format similar to the officer promotion MLR process. 4.19.15.6.  If a panel member identifies a record-based matter that causes concern, he/she will bring the matter to the other panel members, the panel recorder, or directly with the panel president, so that the matter has the attention of the other panel members. 4.19.15.7.  Panel members are encouraged to discuss their own personal knowledge and evaluation of the professional qualifications of their respective promotion eligible airmen. 4.19.15.8.  Panel members may not discuss or disclose the opinion of any person not a member of the panel concerning the member. 4.19.15.9.  Scoring Scale. EFDP will use the following scale when holding a MLR style EFDP: AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 141 Table 4.1.  EFDP Scale. Score 10.0 9.5 9.0 8.5 8.0 7.5 7.0 6.5 6.0 Potential Absolutely superior Outstanding Few could be better Strong Slightly above average Average Slightly below average Well below average Lowest  4.19.15.9.1.  Defining "Splits".  A "split" is a significant disagreement between EFDP members about the score of a record.  A “split” is considered a difference in a score of 2 or more points between any two panel members (e.g., 6 and 8, or 8 and 10). 4.19.15.9.2.  Resolving "Splits".  All scoring stops and all voting EFDP members must be present (physically or virtually) to discuss the records involved in a “split.”  Only EFDP members with split scores may change their scores in the process of resolving a split.  A “split” is resolved when there is a difference in a score of 1.5 or less points between any two panel members (e.g., 6 and 7.5, or 8 and 9.5). 4.20.  Additional EFDP Guidance. 4.20.1.  EFDPs are not required to use all Promote Now and/or Must Promote allocations. 4.20.2.  In the event an egregious event or negative information, having transpired and been substantiated during the reporting period (prior to the applicable SCOD), is brought to light after the SCOD, and after the promotion recommendations have been allocated under forced distribution,  and  the  FDID  authority,  Senior  Rater,  or  Management  Level  (whichever  is applicable), may remove from or downgrade the promotion recommendation (to a Promote or lower) on the ratee’s evaluation. In such a case, the applicable forced distribution promotion allocation will not be reallocated. 4.21.  EFDP Report.  The panel report should contain a list of panel members, panel recorder, order  of  merit  (identifying  total  score,  if/when  applicable),  and  forced  distribution  promotion recommendation  status  based  on  the  available  number  of  Promote  Now  and  Must  Promote allocations, and cut-off score. 4.21.1.  The report should be approved and signed by the Senior Rater or Management Level as the panel president and by the panel recorder. 4.21.2.  Supplemental EFDP consideration will not be given for the following reasons: 4.21.2.1.  Incorrect data reflected on the career brief. 4.21.2.2.  Denied EFDP nomination due to incorrect data reflected on the FDID output products or in the Forced Distribution Career Brief. 142  AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 4.21.2.3.

Not Ready Now:  Not considered ready for promotion at this time based on the need for additional grooming in the current grade, or where Airmen may require specific attention with regard to performance of established AF standards and expectations.  NRN evaluations do not necessarily constitute a referral, provided the report contains no negative comments, derogatory information, or any performance assessment ratings of “Met some but not all expectations”.  Promote:  Recommended for promotion based on performance at or above established AF standards and expectations.  Performs with the majority of Airmen and at a level commensurate with peers.  RegAF Airmen receiving a “P” receive a promotion advantage relative to their peers.  Must Promote:  Recommended for accelerated promotion based on stellar performance well above established AF standards and expectations. Designated for outstanding performers who perform at a level higher than their peers.  RegAF Airmen receiving a “MP” receive a distinct promotion advantage over their peers.  Promote Now:  Recommended for immediate promotion based on exemplary performance that far exceeds established AF standards and expectations. Reserved for elite performers who perform well above other Airmen in their peer group.  RegAF Airmen receiving a “PN” receive a significant promotion advantage over their peers.  AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 151 A Heading I T E M 34  Forced Distributor Name, Grade, Branch of Service, Organization, Command, and Location 35  Duty Title 36  SSN 37  Date & Signature B Instructions Enter appropriate signature block as of the close-out date or in the event of PCS or PCA, information as  of the accounting date.

AGR personnel will require annual evaluations.  A DBH report is required in cases where a promotion/demotion has occurred and a member will have more than 12 months from the closeout date of their last evaluation and the new established SCOD for their new rank. Notes: 1.  SrA and below with less than 20 months TAFMS (or DIEUS for ARC) do not receive an EPR. 2.  The close-out date is the day the Airman has 20 months TAFMS or 20 months from DIEUS date for ARC personnel, unless the Airman reaches his/her 20 months TAFMS/DIEUS on or after 2 Dec, at which time, the Airman’s closeout will be extended to the 31 Mar SCOD for SrA and below.  Subsequent evaluations will close-out on the appropriate SCOD (based on rank). 3.  Only one day is required for raters to close-out an evaluation.  4.  The period of required supervision is reduced to 1 calendar day for referral evaluations. 5.  The close-out date is on the SCOD for the applicable rank (for example, a SSgt will have their close-out on 31 Jan (SSgt SCOD).  EXCEPTION: Airman selected for promotion will have their evaluation closed out on the SCOD of their projected rank.  EXAMPLE: A SSgt selected for promotion to TSgt will now have their evaluation close-out on 30 Nov (TSgt SCOD). 6.  Evaluations IAW AFI 36-2907, are optional.  The close-out of the evaluation prepared when placing a member on the control roster is the day before the date of placement on the control roster.   7.  The close-out date ion is the effective date the Ratee is placed in record status 6, deserter. 8.  When a member is undergoing an involuntary separation due to substandard performance, and the period of supervision has been 60 calendar days, then a commander will complete a Directed by Commander (DBC) evaluation and may only comment on the negative behavior.  This applies to TSgts and below and the commander will close out the evaluation one day before the written notice of the proposed action to the airman.   If a member is being involuntarily separated for reasons other than substandard performance, then a DBC evaluation is not required 9.  The evaluation's close-out is the day before the date that authorities place the Ratee in reporting identifier 9A100 or 9A000. 10.  Do not prepare evaluations for periods of missing in action, captured, or interned status of less  than 15 calendar days. For periods of 15 calendar days or more, prepare an evaluation as HQ AFPC/DP3SP directs. 11.  HQ AFPC/DP3SP (or HQ AFPC/DP2SP) if the evaluation is necessary for promotion consideration) directs evaluations under this rule. 12.  A1Cs who enlisted under the NCS program will receive their initial Evaluation upon completion  of 16 months TAFMS minus 1 day. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 155 A If (see Notes 1 and 8) Table 4.4.

For IMAs, PIRR and PIRR Category E, the unit of attachment is responsible for completing the evaluation. 2.  The close-out date is the day the Airman has 20 months from DIEUS date, unless the Airman reaches his/her 20 months on or after 2 Dec, at which time, the Airman’s closeout will be extended to the 31 Mar SCOD.  The reason for the report remains Initial. Subsequent evaluations will close-out on the appropriate SCOD (based on rank). 3.  If the ratee did not participate during the period, the report must state this information.  4.  HQ USAF/REP directs EPRs under this rule for AFR; NGB/A1P for ANG. 5.  Do not prepare evaluations for periods of MIA, captured, or detained in captive status of less than 15 calendar days. If the ratee remains in one of these categories for 15 calendar days or more, prepare an evaluation under this rule without regard to the number of days of supervision. Close the evaluation on the day the ratee was placed in MIA, captured, or detained in captive status. These evaluations are as directed by HQ AFPC/DP3SP or HQ ARPC/DPTSE. 6.  The close-out date of the evaluation is the effective date the ratee is placed in record  status 6, deserter. 7.

Purpose.  An AF Form 77, Letter of Evaluation (LOE) can be very helpful for a rater when preparing OPRs/EPRs.  Therefore, we strongly encourage the use of LOEs whenever possible, to give the rater tasked to prepare the evaluation, as much detail and accurate information on the ratee’s performance as possible. Additionally, evaluators may request LOEs from others (such as TDY supervisors and former or temporary raters with less than 120 days of supervision during the OPR/EPR reporting period, etc.) at any time; however, unless the LOE is mandatory, the LOE is optional and only a courtesy.  Evaluators preparing an OPR/EPR or TR using an LOE may quote or paraphrase information contained in LOEs.  When authorized, stratification obtained from an LOE must be quoted. 5.2.  Types of Letters of Evaluation (LOE).  There are four types of LOEs: 5.2.1.  Formal Letters of Evaluation. 5.2.1.1.  Formal Letters of Evaluation, (commonly known as the mandatory LOEs), are LOEs that must be accomplished and required to be made a matter of record; placed in the Master Personnel Record Group (MPerRGp). 5.2.1.2.  As of this printing the only formal LOEs are the Deployed Commander LOE and when required for separation.  NOTE:  When applicable, administrative and supplemental LOEs will also be placed in the MPerRGp. 5.2.1.2.1.  Deployed Commander LOEs (Mandatory).  See Table 5.2. 5.2.1.2.1.1.  Definition.  The Deployed Commander LOE is a formal LOE that is used to document performance for those officers deployed to fill squadron, group, and wing commander positions.  When completed will be made a matter of record and  placed  in  the  MPerRGp.    Completed  deployed  commander  LOEs  will  not restart the OPR “clock” regardless of the TDY tour length.  They are considered “embedded” evaluations.  Further, there is no minimum or maximum number of days “supervision” required—the requirement is based upon the number of days the officer filled the commander’s position, which must be at least 45 days. 5.2.1.2.1.2.  Eligibility.    All  deployed  officers  (RegAF,  Guard,  and  Reserve) through the grade of Colonel, serving as commanders for 45 days or more in support of named operations will receive a Deployed Commander LOE. 5.2.1.2.1.2.1.  Deployed commanders are defined as those officers appointed on G-Series orders for 45 days or more, occupying a squadron, group, or wing commander position. 5.2.1.2.1.2.2.  If  a  commander  position  was  filled  for  less  than  45  days,  an informal LOE will be prepared, unless referred.  The informal LOE will not be made a matter of record, but home station raters may use the information in the member’s next OPR.   AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 183 5.2.1.2.1.2.3.  For those officers filling 365-day extended deployment positions as the squadron, group, or wing commander, a deployed commander’s LOE is not appropriate.  Those officers will receive an OPR IAW paragraph 3.9. 5.2.1.2.1.3.  Effective Date and Implementation.  In Oct 2004, this CSAF initiative became  effective  with  AEF  Cycle  5,  Pairs  1  and  2.    This  policy  will  not  be grandfathered for officers who were filling deployed commander positions prior to AEF Cycle 5. 5.2.1.2.1.4.  Deployed Commander LOE Processing Specifics. 5.2.1.2.1.4.1.  See Table 5.1 for instruction on how to complete AF Forms 77, Letter of Evaluations (LOEs) for deployed commanders. 5.2.1.2.1.4.2.  Deployed  CC  LOEs  are  mandatory  and  will  be  filed  in  the Officer Selection Record for officers through the grade of Colonel deployed for 45 days or more in support of named operations and on G-Series orders in a squadron, group, or wing commander position.  If a commander position was filled for less than 45 days, the LOE is informal and will not be filed in the Officer Selection Record (OSR).  Completed deployed CC LOEs will not restart the  OPR  “clock”  regardless  of  the  TDY  tour  length.    They  are  considered “embedded”  reports.    Further,  there  is  no  minimum  number  of  days “supervision” required--the requirement is based upon the number of days the officer filled the commander position; a minimum 45 consecutive days. 5.2.1.2.1.4.3.  A negative assessment or negative comments will make the LOE a referral and require additional rater comments.  If the evaluation is a referral, the  reverse  side  of  the  form  (Section  VIII)  is  also  completed.    There  is  no minimum number of days (served in the CC position or days of supervision) required for completion of a referral LOE.  NOTE:  A non-concur does not necessarily make the report a referral. 5.2.1.2.1.4.4.  The  AF  Form  77  must  be  completed  by  two  evaluators:  the immediate next-level commander in the rating chain (the rater), and the rater’s rater (the additional rater).  EXCEPTION:  If the rater is a General Officer, then the rater is considered a single evaluator (see definition) and an additional rater is not required (unless referral). 5.2.1.2.1.4.5.  Digital  signatures  will  be  used  except  in  the  following  cases: referral evaluations; when at least one evaluator does not have a CAC; or at least one evaluator does not have access to a CAC enabled computer.  In these cases the LOEs will be printed and signed with “wet” (hand signed) signatures. 5.2.1.2.1.4.6.  A typed form is mandatory, but if no word processor is available, may be handwritten, and completed NLT seven (7) calendar days after ratee relinquishes command.  The goal should be to ensure that the LOE is completed before  returning  to  home  station.    The  “FROM”  and  “THRU”  dates  are determined by the date assumed/relinquished command. 5.2.1.2.1.4.7.  LOEs  will  be  accepted  directly  from  individual  officers; however, the LOE will not be processed until the PERSCO Team/AFFOR A1 184 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 verifies the eligibility of the officer and approves the LOE.  It is suggested that the officer contact their PERSCO Team/AFFOR A1 to route the LOE through the appropriate channels. 5.2.1.2.1.5.  Deployed Responsibilities. 5.2.1.2.1.5.1.  COMAFFOR:    Determines  the  rating  chain  and  ensures compliance  with  policy  at  the  deployed  location.    NOTE:    Normally  the TACON determines the rating chain. 5.2.1.2.1.5.2.  AF Component A1:  Ensures G-series orders are completed for expeditionary organization structure.  Identifies commanders, forwards list to AFFOR/A1, and ensures G-Series orders are completed on all wing, group, and squadron  commanders  (colonel  and  below)  and  maintained  IAW  AFRIMS RDS. 5.2.1.2.1.5.3.  AFFOR/A1:    Prepares  list  of  eligible  deployed  commanders, identifies  the  officers’  service  component  and  forwards  to  the  appropriate PERSCO team.  Upon receipt of PERSCO validated roster, AFFOR/A1 will forward roster to AFPC/DP2SPE.  NOTE:  Since G-Series orders are normally accomplished  and  maintained  at  the  unit  where  the  commander  is  serving, AFFOR/A1 and PERSCO teams must work closely with the servicing JA and commanders when reviewing and validating the list of required LOEs.  Ensure only those commanders on official G-Series orders are included. 5.2.1.2.2.  For A1C and below with less than 20 months’ Total Active Federal Military Service  (TAFMS),  an  LOE  is  required  for  separation  cases  involving  parenthood; conditions that interfere with military service; unsatisfactory performance; or failure in the fitness program. See AFI 36-3208. 5.2.1.2.3.  Palace Chase/Front or Transfer to another Service.  If the ratee is separating to  go  into  the  ARC,  or  transferring  to  another  branch  of  service,  an  OPR/EPR  is required.  However, (Officers only) if there is less than 120 days supervision, an LOE is required.  If required, an AF Form 77 will also be completed to cover any gaps there may be in the record. 5.2.2.  Informal Letters of Evaluation (LOE). 5.2.2.1.  Informal Letters of Evaluation (LOE), (commonly known as the optional LOE), are  those  LOEs  that  will  NOT  be  placed  in  the  Master  Personnel  Records  Group (MPerRGp). 5.2.2.1.1.  Informal LOEs may be mandated; however only formal LOEs will be filed in the MPerRGp, see Table 5.2. 5.2.2.1.2.  Informal LOEs are used by the designated rater to assist in preparing the individual’s next performance evaluation.  Although encouraged, using the information from the LOE is at the discretion of the designated rater; and if used, evaluators may paraphrase  or  quote  information  from  LOEs;  however,  they  may  not  paraphrase  or quote stratification statements from these LOEs. 5.2.2.1.3.  Informal  LOEs  are  not  attached  to  the  completed  evaluations  when  the evaluations are made a matter of record. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 185 5.2.2.2.  Informal LOEs are used to: 5.2.2.2.1.  Document periods when someone other than the designated rater supervises the ratee, (optional, but highly encouraged). 5.2.2.2.2.  Document duty performance for periods of performance of at least 60 days, unless otherwise stated in this AFI; and are too short (less than 120 days supervision), to require an OPR (mandatory). 5.2.2.2.3.  Document  duty  performance  for  periods  of  time  when  the  ratee  is  under another chain of command other than the designated rater, i.e. loaned out to another section (optional, but highly encouraged).  NOTE:  This would only apply to officers when there is no approved rating change deviation, see paragraph 1.7. 5.2.2.2.4.  Document  duty  performance  of  deployed  personnel  not  assigned  to  a deployed commander’s billet (mandatory). 5.2.2.2.5.  Document duty performance for deployed personnel not assigned to a 365-day extended deployment billet (mandatory). 5.2.2.2.6.  Document duty performance for enlisted personnel who have a PCS/PCA prior to the SCOD (mandatory).  NOTE:  In circumstances where the Rater departs, a draft EPR will be completed to fulfill this requirement. 5.2.2.2.7.  Document  performance  for  other  purposes  when  directed  by  HQ  USAF (may be mandatory or optional). 5.2.2.3.  LOEs During Contingency Operations. 5.2.2.3.1.  LOEs  during  contingency  operations  are  informal  LOEs  that  may  be required  on  all  personnel  in  support  of  contingency  operations,  that  are  not  filling deployed  commander  positions,  or  extended  deployment  positions.    LOEs  will  be accomplished no later than seven days prior to the ratee’s departure for home station and will cover the period from the first day of supervision (at the attached unit) through the  last  day  of  supervision  while  at  the  deployed  location.    Although  they  are mandatory,  they  will  not  be  made  a  matter  of  record.    They  are  used  to  provide information  to  home  station  raters  in  preparation  of  the  ratee’s  next  performance evaluation. 5.2.2.3.2.  Since there are no official means to track LOEs in a deployed environment, the sole responsibility will rest on the deployed rater.  As a matter of integrity; the deployed  rater  is  responsible  for  ensuring  they  document  the  performance  of  the personnel under them during contingency operations and make every effort to do so and forward to the home station rater. 5.2.2.3.3.  Ratee’s  are  also  encouraged  to  ensure  LOEs  are  accomplished  by  their deployed rater.  Failure to receive an LOE is not grounds to appeal a future evaluation based on the absence of, or the lack of deployment information in an evaluation. 5.2.2.3.4.  When an entire unit deploys to the same location, and/or when the member’s home  station  rater  is  also  the  deployed  rater,  no  LOE  is  required.    The  member’s performance can be documented in the member’s next performance evaluation. 186 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 5.2.2.3.5.  When the deployed rater is not the home station rater an informal LOE is required. 5.2.2.3.5.1.  Minimum number of days supervision is 60 days, however deployed raters may write LOEs for periods of less than 60 days. 5.2.2.3.5.2.  There is no maximum number of days supervision required.  The close-out of the LOE will be one day prior to the departure date of the ratee and/or rater. 5.2.2.3.5.3.  Deployed rater’s who have supervised for at least 60 days, who departs prior to the ratee, will prepare an LOE to pass to the incoming deployed rater.  The incoming  deployed  rater  can  use  the  information  in  his/her  LOE  or  prepare  a separate LOE, in which case the ratee could possibly have more than one LOE for the same deployment. 5.2.2.3.5.4.  Deployed raters prepare LOEs and provide a copy to the individual and forward the original to the servicing PERSCO team. 5.2.2.3.6.  In most cases, PERSCO teams can and will set up local procedures to ensure LOEs are being prepared on the deployed personnel they service.  EXAMPLE:  They can add the LOE requirement to their out-processing checklist. 5.2.2.3.7.  PERSCO teams will forward the original LOE to the member’s servicing MPS or CSS/HR Specialist who will forward the LOE to the rater to review when accomplishing the next evaluation.  Although highly encouraged, home station raters may or may not use the information when preparing the next evaluation. 5.2.2.3.8.  In the event circumstances preclude a rater from accomplishing an LOE at the time of departure, (i.e. mass evacuation or interruption or loss of automated data processing capabilities), the rater should make every attempt to provide an LOE to the member’s home station CSS/HR Specialist when feasible or upon return to their home station.  Remember as a supervisor, it is your responsibility to take care of your people. 5.2.3.  Supplemental Letters of Evaluation.  Are LOEs that are required to be made a matter of record and will be placed in the MPerRGp attached to the evaluation they are supplementing. 5.2.3.1.  Types of Supplemental LOEs include: 5.2.3.1.1.  Continuation Sheets for Referral Evaluations.  See paragraph 1.10. 5.2.3.1.2.  Continuation Sheets for Evaluator Disagreements.  See paragraph 1.9. 5.2.3.1.3.  Continuation Sheets for the Air Force Advisor.  See paragraph 1.6.8. 5.2.3.1.4.  Continuation Sheet for the Functional/Acquisition Examiner. See paragraph 1.6.8. 5.2.4.  Administrative Letters of Evaluation.  Are LOEs that are required to be made a matter of  record  and  will  be  placed  in  the  MPerRGp  to  document  missing/voided  evaluations  in performance records. 5.2.4.1.  Administrative LOEs are not derogatory in nature. 5.2.4.2.  Administrative LOEs are used to justify legitimate gaps between evaluations such as: AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 187 5.2.4.2.1.  To document a break in service, see Table 5.1. 5.2.4.2.2.  To document extended periods of lost time, including prisoner status and appellate leave.  Upon release an AF Form 77 will be accomplished by the servicing MPS/CSS.  The start date will be the day after the close-out of the last evaluation and the  end  date  will  be  the  day  the  member  is  released  from  confinement.    The  next evaluation will begin the day after the close-out date of the LOE, see Table 5.1. 5.2.4.2.3.  To  document  an  Educational  Leave  of  Absences;  i.e.  Bootstrap  and/or Educational Leave to a civilian institution, see Table 5.1. 5.2.4.2.4.  To  document  a  legitimate  gap  when  the  ratee  was  on  the  Temporary Disability Retired List (TDRL); then removed and returned to AD, see Table 5.1. 5.2.4.3.  Administrative LOEs are used to substitute lost, missing or removed evaluations such as those: 5.2.4.3.1.  Ordered removed by the AFBCMR, in accordance with AFI 36-2603.  See Table 5.1. 5.2.4.3.2.  Ordered removed by the ERAB, in accordance with Chapter 10, see Table 5.1. 5.2.4.3.3.  Lost and/or missing evaluations in which all actions to locate have failed.  See paragraph 1.14. for procedures and Table 5.1 for preparation of AF Form 77. 5.2.4.4.  The use of Administrative LOEs must be approved by HQ AFPC or HQ ARPC prior to placing them into the MPerRGp. 5.2.5.  Other Purposes. 5.2.5.1.  HQ AFPC/DP2SPE may use the AF Form 77 to document when a board specific PRF is not required or available as stated below: 5.2.5.1.1.  For officers who are on appellate leave or in prisoner status. 5.2.5.1.2.  For officers who entered RegAF directly into Air  Force-level  training or officers who had a break in service and reentered directly into Air Force-level training. 5.2.6.  When directed by HQ USAF. 5.3.  Who Will Prepare. 5.3.1.  Raters, or any evaluators. 5.3.1.1.  Refer  to  paragraph  1.7.  when  the  rater  has  been  relieved  from  their  rating responsibilities. 5.3.1.2.  Do not skip evaluators who are temporarily unavailable or to afford a higher level evaluator the opportunity to endorse or comment on the LOE. 5.3.2.  Personnel responsible for observing a ratee’s performance when the ratee is not under the direct supervision of the designated rater. 5.3.3.  Records custodians responsible for maintaining the MPerRGp, OSR, OCSR and NSR. 5.3.4.  Personnel directed to do so by the AFBCMR or ERAB. 188 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 5.3.5.  MPS/CSS/HR Specialist personnel as authorized. 5.4.  Administrative Practices. 5.4.1.

If a commander is forward deployed to fill another commander requirement at a different location, he/she may receive more than one LOE provided the minimum 45 calendar day requirement is met at each location. The commander must be designated on G-Series orders. EXCEPTION: Commanders filling 365-day extended deployment billets will have an OPR accomplished. 2.  Supervision Requirements. A minimum of 60 days and not more than 120 days supervision is required. Deployed personnel not covered in Rule 1, or deployed personnel not filling a 365-day extended deployment, require a minimum of 60 days supervision. However, supervision may be greater than 120 days, depending on how long the member is deployed and/or extended.  The close-out date will be one day prior to the member’s departure date. 3.  Prepare when required by AFI 36-3205, AFI 36-3206, AFI 36-3207, AFI 36-3208 and AFI 36-3209. 4.  Supplemental LOEs are required to be attached to the document they are supplementing and will be file in the MPerRGp with that document. 5.  Administrative LOEs are filed in the MPerRGp for informational purposes, to explain gaps in records, missing evaluations, breaks in service, etc. 6.  If the ratee has less than 20 months TAFMS and comments in the LOE are referral in nature, only an informal LOE is authorized. The comments from this LOE may be included in the ratee’s initial evaluation. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 201 Chapter 6 AF FORM 475, EDUCATION/TRAINING REPORT 6.1.  When to Use Training Reports (TR). 6.1.1.  Mandatory Submission (See Table 6.2). 6.1.1.1.

Evaluations prepared under this rule begin the day following the “THRU” date of the student’s last OPR or TR unless it is an initial evaluation.  For initial evaluation, the  “FROM” date is:  the date of officer’s entry on EAD or start of the current AGR/LEAD assignment; or the date of the first federally recognized appointment for ANG students not on EAD; or for AFR students not on EAD, the date of the last assignment to the Ready Reserve position presently held.  The "THRU" date is the date the training or course ends or when the officer is released by the training organization.  EXAMPLE:  A student has an OPR that closed out on 1 July 2014 and attends a course beginning on 6 August 2014.  The course graduated on 5 August 2015. The period of evaluation should be 2 July 2014 to 5 August 2015.  In the event the officer remains in Casual Status with the training organization, the period of the evaluation will be to the date the officer is released.  AFR Air Reserve Technicians (ART) and ANG Military Technicians attending formal training or education in civilian status receive TRs and credit in the civilian evaluation system.  NOTE:  For course lengths, refer to the Air Force Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) at site https://etca.randolph.af.mil, or other appropriate directive.  ETCA is a database that replaced AFCAT 36-2223, USAF Formal Schools Catalog. 2.  Do not accomplish TRs on students in the Education Leave of Absence Program (ELAP) in TDY status unless course length is 26 weeks or more. 3.  The OCSRG is not maintained on lieutenants or non-promotion eligible captains on the ADL. 4.  ASBC graduates will receive AF Form 475 regardless of course length. 5.  Evaluations prepared under this rule cover a period independent of the officer’s OPR period of evaluation. Therefore, it is not necessary to prepare an OPR solely because the officer is going to school.  Use the following period of report:  “FROM” date is the course start date; and the “THRU” date is the date of completion, interruption, or elimination from   formal training or education training.  EXAMPLE:  An officer had an OPR that closed out on 1 Nov 2014 and attends a course from 1 January 2015 to 1 Apr 2015. The AF Form 475 covers the period from 1 January 2015 to 1 Apr 2015.  The officer’s next OPR will have a “FROM” date of 2 November 2014 and the time the officer is absent will be subtracted from the period of supervision on the next OPR. AFR ART and ANG Military Technicians attending formal training or education in civilian status receive TRs and credit in the civilian evaluation system.  NOTE:  For course lengths, refer to   the Air Force Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) at site https://etca.randolph.af.mil, or other appropriate directive.  ETCA is a database that replaced AFCAT 36-2223, USAF Formal Schools Catalog.  AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 211 6.  Includes Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT), Student Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT), Undergraduate Navigator Training (UNT), Student Undergraduate Navigator Training (SUNT), Undergraduate Space and Missile Training (USMT), Aircraft Maintenance Officer Course and other entry-level courses (as determined by the MAJCOM).  Officials at MAJCOM HQs and HQ USAF are responsible for the course content and curriculum and determine if the course is initial qualification.  NOTE:  Officers in the second year of AF/XO-sponsored Nuclear Technology Fellows Program, working in their primary specialty, and Health Profession Officers who are in-utilization training for 1 Year or more will have an OPR versus a TR.  AF/XO and AF/SG will  determine the rating chain for the identified officers and in  coordination with HQ AFPC/DP3SP, will determine which positions will be designated Senior Rater for these officers.  These nuclear technology fellows and health profession officers still remain students in training status.  This policy affects OPRs only and will have no impact on the requirement for narrative only PRFs for the officers in training. 7.  This training applies to judge advocates, chaplains, and medical officers. 8.  Annual, Directed, and Final TRs, as appropriate, will be prepared at the end of each training phase. a.  Annual TRs will be prepared by the sponsoring organization for interns in Phase IIIA; they  will close-out on 30 Jun. b.  Directed TRs will be prepared by the sponsoring organization for interns in Phase IIIB who opt to complete a master’s degree or elect a third rotation; TRs will cover the period 1 Jul to 31 Dec. c.  Final TRs will be prepared by the sponsoring organization for interns who opt for a post-training assignment upon completion of Phase IIIB or who opt for and complete a third rotation. 9.  For self-paced formal AF training courses when the prescribed course length is eight weeks or more, regardless of the time actually required to complete the course. 10.  AF Form 475 on chaplain candidates are prepared and processed as prescribed by HQ ARPC.  ARPC/DPTSE will file chaplain AF Forms 475 in the selection folder. 11.  This is generally training designed to upgrade or enhance an officer's qualification in a utilization field.  Includes initial qualification in a weapon system for officers qualified in that utilization field.  EXAMPLE:  Pilots undergoing initial F-15 training would be evaluated under this rule. 12.  For members participating in the WCAP, one year from beginning training, then annually until training is completed or member is eliminated from training. 13.  Members fulfilling these requirements must complete six months of training with the US Army prior to departing for the actual deployment.  Therefore, students attending Interrogator Training are administratively assigned to the 314th Training Squadron, Fort Huachuca, for the 23-week program.  These evaluations will be updated in MilPDS.    212 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 Table 6.3.  Updating Officer Training Reports.  See Note.

This chapter covers procedures for completing GO evaluations (AF Form 78).  It applies  to  all  ADL  and  Reserve  of  the  Air  Force  brigadier  generals  and  major  generals  (and selectees to those grades) except State adjutants general who are not required to be rated.  NOTE:  The ANG does not have GO selects or frocking. 7.2.  Forms Used. 7.2.1.  Use  AF  Form  78,  to  document  performance  and  promotion  recommendation  (as applicable) for all brigadier generals, major generals and those selected or frocked to those grades (see Table 7.1). 7.2.2.  Use AF Form 77 to document performance and potential and to provide that information to the ML (see Table 7.2.).  It is also used to document performance of GOs/selectees who are serving in a TDY status for more than 60 days but less than 179 days.  GOs/selectees who are serving in a TDY status for more than 180 days receive an AF Form 78 (see Table 7.1.). 7.3.  Reasons for Reports. 7.3.1.  Annual Reports.  Brigadier general and brigadier general selectee reports close-out 31 July;  NonEAD  brigadier  general  (to  include  BG  select)  reports  close-out  31  May;  ANG brigadier  general  reports  close  out  31  January.    Major  general  and  major  general  selectee reports close-out 30 June. 7.3.2.  CRO Reports.  In the event a CRO occurs and there are at least 90 days of supervision, a CRO report is optional if the CRO occurs outside 90 days from the annual requirement with the approval of AF/DPG (AF/REG for Non-EAD Officers and NGB-GO for ANGUS general officers). 7.3.3.  Directed by HQ USAF Reports.  AF/DPG (AF/REG for Non-EAD officers) may direct GO reports at any time, regardless of the days of supervision. 7.3.4.  Directed by CNGB Reports.  NGB-GO may direct GO reports at any time, regardless of the days of supervision. 7.3.5.  Officers Selected for brigadier general (RegAF and ARC).  This report covers the period of supervision since the member’s last report as a colonel and transitions the member to the brigadier general Annual Report cycle.  The AF Form 78 is used to document the member’s performance.  See paragraph 7.4.8 for further details. 7.3.6.   For ANG Only.  Upon Federal recognition to brigadier general, an ANG colonel will receive one final AF Form 707, either a CRO or Directed by CNGB Report, documenting all duty performed as a colonel.  The day of Federal recognition to brigadier general will be the start date of the officer’s first AF Form 78 with a report closeout the following 31 January to align  the  member  to  the  brigadier  general  Annual  Report  cycle.    If  less  than  90  days  has occurred  since  the  colonel’s  last  AF  Form  707,  coordinate  with  NGB-GO  to  determine appropriate procedures.  214 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 7.4.  General Instructions. 7.4.1.  Who receives reports.  Brigadier and major generals and selectees to those grades will receive at least one AF Form 78 per calendar year.  If a CRO occurs between January and the date the annual report is due (31 July for brigadier generals and selects and 30 June for major generals and selects) coordinate with AF/DPG to determine appropriate procedures.  For ANG, coordinate with NGB-GO to determine appropriate procedures. 7.4.2.  GOs nominated for lieutenant general (RegAF and ARC).  Once a GO is nominated for appointment to lieutenant general, completion of the report is optional.  Remove the GO from the  ML  control  group.    For  ANG.    Upon  Federal  recognition  to  lieutenant  general,  GO evaluations are no longer required. 7.4.3.  GOs who have applied for retirement (RegAF and ARC).  Completion of the report is optional  for  all  major  generals  if  AF/DPG  (AF/REG  for  Non-EAD  officers)  publicly announces a GO’s retirement before the annual close-out date.  If the GO is a brigadier general and is eligible for promotion consideration to major general and the approved retirement date is more than 90 days from the promotion board convening date, a report is mandatory.  If the brigadier general is promotion eligible and the approved retirement date is within 90 days of the major general board convening date, remove the GO from the ML control group.  For ANG.  Completion of the report is optional for all brigadier and major generals once NGB-GO has received the state retirement package requesting transfer to ARPC, Retired Reserves. 7.4.3.1.  Write a report if a GO withdraws his or her retirement.  The report will close-out on the appropriate current cycle OPR close-out date. 7.4.3.2.  (For RegAF and ARC).  Make a promotion recommendation on AF Form 78, block 15, only if the promotion-eligible officer withdraws his or her retirement within 90 days prior to the annual cycle close-out date.  For ANG.  AF Form 78, blocks 15a and 15b, are completed for brigadier generals who have at least one year in grade. 7.4.4.  Officers with Dual Responsibilities in Separate MLs.  The ratee's ML of administrative assignment  controls  the  promotion  recommendation  (or  evaluation)  of  officers  with  dual responsibilities  in  separate  MLs.    However,  any  of  the  ratee's  supervisors  may  submit appropriate communications to the ML for consideration. 7.4.4.1.  Use the ratee's duty effective date and the annual cycle close-out date to determine the ML of administrative assignment. 7.4.4.2.  Any member of the ratee's rating chain (in either ML) may submit appropriate communications to the endorsing official for consideration. 7.4.5.  Officers Removed for Cause.  Document the reason an officer was removed from duty for cause in the appropriate annual or CRO report.  Contact AF/DPG (AF/REG for Non-EAD Officers, or NGB-GO for ANGUS general officers) if you have less than 90 days supervision as the individual's rater. 7.4.6.  Officers Reassigned to a New ML during the Evaluation Process (includes Command Redesignations).  If an officer is reassigned to a new ML within 60 days before or after the annual cycle close-out date, either the gaining or losing ML completes the endorser portion (block 16) on the AF Form 78.  Both MLs must agree on which ML  will function as the endorsing official.  HQ AF/A1, AF/DPG (AF/REG for Non-EAD Officers) and NGB-GO for AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 215 ANGUS general officers must concur with the decision.  If a CRO occurs within the period 60 to 90 days before the annual cycle closes out and the ratee changes MLs during this period, the losing ML completes the CRO report (do not complete block 15).  Follow the directions in the next  subparagraphs  to  determine  who  completes  the  final  endorsement  and/or  promotion recommendation. 7.4.6.1.  If the ratee worked directly for the losing ML (no intermediate supervisor), then the losing ML prepares the rater portion of the AF Form 78 (through block 14) and forwards it  to  the  gaining  ML  for  completion,  to  include  the  final  endorsement  or  promotion recommendation (blocks 15a and 15b). 7.4.6.2.  If the ratee did not work directly for the losing ML, then the losing rater completes the rater portion of the AF Form 78 (through block 14) and forwards it to the losing ML.  The losing ML completes a mandatory AF Form 77, attaches it to the AF Form 78 and forwards both forms to the gaining ML for completion, to include the final endorsement or promotion recommendation (blocks 15a and 15b). 7.4.7.  Officers Reassigned within the current ML during the evaluation process.  If an officer moves within 90 days of the appropriate annual cycle close-out date and the officer's ML does not change, the rater completes a CRO report (minimum 90 days supervision).  This report will serve in place of the annual report.  Provide the report to the ML for completion of blocks 15 through 19 (on promotion-eligible officers [for ANG, brigadier generals who have at least one year in grade]) or blocks 16 through 19 (officers not promotion-eligible [for ANG, brigadier generals who do not have at least one year in grade]).  The ML will complete the report upon the annual cycle close-out date along with other annual reports on officers in the same control group.  If a CRO occurs within the period 60 to 90 days before the annual cycle closes out and the ratee does not change MLs during this period (e.g., rater departs PCS or ratee changes jobs within ML), the rater completes a CRO report and the ML holds the report until the end of the annual cycle.  The CRO report will serve as the annual report. 7.4.8.  Officers Selected for Brigadier General (RegAF and ARC). 7.4.8.1.  When an officer's selection for brigadier general is publicly announced by HQ AF/DPG (AF/REG for Non-EAD Officers), prepare an AF Form 78.  Comply with Table 7.1.  Open the ratee’s evaluation report on the day following the close-out of the colonel's previous report. 7.4.8.2.  If  the  member’s  last  OPR  as  a  colonel  closes  out  before  the  annual  brigadier general cycle (31 Jul or 31 May for Non-EAD), the member’s next performance report will close-out 31 Jul or 31 May for Non-EAD, unless a CRO or directed by HQ USAF report is required.  The member’s next report will comply with paragraph 7.3. 7.4.8.3.  If the member’s last OPR as a colonel closes out after the annual brigadier general cycle (31 Jul), AF/DPG will direct a “Directed by HQ USAF Report” be completed with a close- out of 31 Jul, unless a CRO report is required beforehand.  For Non-EAD, if the member’s last OPR closes out after the annual brigadier general cycle (31 May), AF/REG will direct a DBH with a close-out date of 31 May, unless a CRO is required beforehand.  The member’s next report will comply with paragraph 7.3. 7.4.8.4.  Forward reports within 30 days of the close-out to:  AF/DPG for EAD officers and AF/REG for Non-EAD officers. 216 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 7.4.9.  (For  ANG  Only).    See  paragraph  7.3.6  for  ANG  colonels  transitioning  to  brigadier general. 7.5.  Processing  General  Officer  Evaluations.  Email  all  digitally  signed  general  officer evaluation reports to AF/DPG for EAD officers, AF/REG for Non-EAD officers and NGB-GO for ANGUS  general  officers.    AF/DPG,  AF/REG  and  NGB  GO  will  upload  evaluations  into  the member’s PRDA record.  NGB-GO is also responsible for updating MilPDS for ANGUS general officers. 7.5.1.  EAD  Officers  Assigned  to  an  Air  Force  Activity.    In  activities  with  a  director  of personnel (A1) function (e.g., MAJCOMs), the A1 ensures evaluators complete all reports correctly and forwards them to AF/DPG within 30 days of the report close-out date. 7.5.2.  EAD Officers Assigned to Air Force Secretariat, Air Staff, or Non-AF activities.  For activities  not  serviced  by  an  Air  Force  A1,  AF/DPG  assists  executive  officers  with  the preparation of the AF Form 78. 7.5.3.  Air Force Reserve General Officers.  Send reports to AF/REG within 30 days of the report close-out date. 7.5.4.  ANGUS GOs.  Send reports on ANG GOs to NGB-GO within 30 days of the report close-out date. 7.5.5.  When  a  Report  Becomes  A  Matter  of  Record.    For  EAD  officers,  once  the  CSAF reviews the report and AF/DPG accepts the report for file, the report becomes a matter of record.  For ANGUS GOs, the report becomes a matter of record when NGB-GO accepts the report for file.  For non-EAD officers, the report becomes a matter of record when AF/REG accepts the report for file. 7.5.6.  Release of Reports to Ratees by Reporting, Reviewing, and Endorsing Officials.  The ML should provide a copy of the completed report to the ratee.  The rater, reviewing official or ML (at their discretion) should discuss its contents with the ratee.  Ratees may access copies of their reports via PRDA under a folder called “Selection Folder” within their PRDA account or request copies from AF/DPG, NGB-GO for ANG general officers, or AF/REG for non-EAD officers.  Advise ratees a report is not considered a matter of record until it is reviewed by CSAF (does not apply to ANG GO or AFR reports) and filed in the member’s general officer selection record. 7.5.7.  AF/DPG  maintains  all  EAD  performance  reports  with  close-out  dates  on  or  after  1 February 1991.  NOTE:  AF Forms 71, 77, and 78 that closed out on or before 31 January 1991  are  not  available  for  review.  They  were  rendered  under  an  express  promise  of confidentiality and are exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act.   AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 217 Table 7.1.

Major general & brigadier general “(Sel)”/“Frocked” signing OES forms: a. Once Senate confirmed, colonels on the brigadier general select list are permitted to sign all OES forms as “(Sel)” provided that they are either designated by their respective management level (ML) as a senior rater or they are assigned to an authorized brigadier general officer position. b. Once Senate confirmed, brigadier generals on the major general select list are permitted to sign all OES forms as “(Sel)” provided that they are either evaluating other general officers or are assigned to an authorized maj gen officer position. c. Frocked GOs are authorized to sign all OES forms in their frocked grade without designating their “Frocked” status (i.e. major general vice major general “Frocked”). d. Once Senate confirmed, all GO selects assigned to joint billets or unified commands may sign all OES forms as “(Sel)”.  For ANG.

AF Form 709 (for Active Duty List [ADL] officers). 8.1.1.  Purpose.    The  purpose  of  the  promotion  recommendation  process  is  to  provide performance-based differentiation to assist Central Selection Boards (CSBs).  The AF Form 709,  Promotion  Recommendation  (PRF),  is  used  for  promotion  purposes  only.    NOTE:  Except for paragraphs 8.2. and 8.6., this chapter does not pertain to ANG or AFR officers who are not on the ADL. 8.1.2.  Types of PRFs: 8.1.2.1.  Narrative-Only  (N-O)  PRFs.    The  losing  senior  rater  completes  these  on  all lieutenant colonels and below (EXCEPTION:  Not required for majors who are lieutenant colonel selects) departing PCS for a school (e.g., Developmental Education, AFIT, or other AF-level  training  programs  as  described  by  8.3.5.2  )  or  PCA/PCS  to  patient  status.  Complete N-O PRFs regardless of promotion zone.  Do not complete PRFs on lieutenants or  captains  who  will  have  less  than  four  years  TIG  as  a  captain  upon  completion  of schooling.  EXCEPTION:  For Medical Corps/Dental Corps officers only, complete N-O PRF  regardless  of  their  current  grade,  DOR  or  promotion  selection  status,  due  to  the possibilities of their continual long term training status.  See paragraph 8.1.5.6.  NOTE:  In the rare cases where a PRF is required for colonels and colonel/lieutenant colonel selects while in a student status, the senior rater prior to the officer’s departure to DE will write the PRF. 8.1.2.2.  Recommendation-Only  (R-O)  PRFs.    The  Air  Force  Student  MLR  President completes these for all officers who are eligible for consideration by that review.  Attach the R-O PRF to the N-O PRF and file both in the OSR.  See paragraph 8.1.5.6. 8.1.2.3.  Regular PRFs.  An eligible officer's senior rater completes the PRF no earlier than 60 days prior to the CSB for which the officer is promotion eligible (PRF cutoff date) and awards one of three recommendations: 8.1.2.3.1.  A  “Definitely  Promote”  (“DP”)  recommendation:    The  strength  of    the ratee’s performance and performance-based potential warrants promotions. 8.1.2.3.2.  A  “Promote”  (“P”)  recommendation  means  the  ratee  is  qualified  for promotion  and  should  compete  on  the  basis  of  performance,  performance-based potential,  and  other  considerations  such  as  duty  history,  developmental  education, advanced degrees, etc. 8.1.2.3.3.  A “Do Not Promote This Board” (“DNP”) recommendation:  The strength of  the  ratee’s  performance  and  performance-based  potential  does  not  warrant promotion by the CSB for which the officer is  eligible.  A senior  rater  must make comments explaining to the CSB why the officer should not be promoted.  Comments must focus on the substandard behavior of the officer and if desired the punishment received. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 223 8.1.3.  Completing the PRF.  See Table 8.1 (and paragraph 8.6 on promotion-eligible colonels) for specific guidance on preparing PRFs. 8.1.3.1.  Comments in Section IV, Promotion Recommendation, of the PRF are mandatory for  In  and  Above  the  Zone  (I/APZ)  eligible  officers  (Table  8.1.),  except  on  PRFs  for officers two or more times above the zone and PRFs prepared to the grade of brigadier general  when  the  overall  recommendation  in  AF  Form  709,  Section  IX,  Overall Recommendation, is "Promote."  Final decision authority for including comments on BPZ and two or more times above-the-zone officers remains with the SR.  SRs retain the latitude to push their best-qualified officers but are not required to complete Section IV of the PRF on all APZ officers already deferred two or more times.  Comments are required on all PRFs with a "Do Not Promote This Board" recommendation, regardless of zone (Table 8.1.). 8.1.3.2.  If promotion opportunity is 100%, regular PRFs are not required.  This includes individuals  competing  for  I/APZ;  any  officers  competing  for  BPZ  will  still  require  a completed PRF.  EXCEPTIONS:  Senior raters will prepare PRFs on all officers who receive "DNP" recommendations and on all officers who receive a “P” recommendation but have derogatory information (Article 15, courts-martial, referral evaluation, LOR, etc.) filed in their OSR. 8.1.3.3.  For  LAF  Capt  PRFs:    MLRs  are  prohibited  (except  for  AF  Level  Students); “Definitely  Promote”  recommendation  PRFs  are  not  authorized  any  comments; “Promote/Do Not Promote” recommendations are limited to a maximum of 5 lines.  Each SR with one eligible officer (regardless of zone) will receive one allocated “DP”.  Any additional  “DPs”  will  be  awarded  based  on  the  allocation  rate  which  is  announced approximately 60 days prior to the CSB. 8.1.3.4.  Prohibited Evaluator Considerations and Comments.  Certain items are prohibited for consideration in the performance evaluation process and will not be commented upon on any PRF.  Except as authorized in the following paragraphs, do not consider, refer to, or include comments regarding: 8.1.3.4.1.  Quoted or attributed stratification remarks from OPRs, provided that they are also quantified, may be used on PRFs. 8.1.3.4.2.  Statements that refer or imply to the stratification of an officer’s standing at an MLR, such as: “#1 of 22 DPs awarded at the MLR,” or “If the MLR had one more DP, he/she would get it,” are prohibited.  This means the head of the ML or MLR President  may  not  use  the  denominator  of  the  MLs  eligibles  when  stratifying  their respective officers, which may have or have not competed at the MLR. 8.1.3.5.  Promotion statements, reserved for the senior rater, will only be made on the PRF. 8.1.3.5.1.  As a general rule, prohibited promotion statements are any comments, direct or implied, that refer to a higher grade.  For example, any comments that state the individual is performing above his/her grade, occupying a position requiring a more senior grade, comparing an individual to officers of higher rank, or alluding to a higher ranking position are all prohibited. 224 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 8.1.3.5.2.  While  it  is  impossible  to  provide  an  all-inclusive  list  of  prohibited statements; some examples are: 8.1.3.5.2.1.  “Maj  Burgess  is  senior  officer  material.”  (The  term  “Senior”  is  a euphemism for colonel and above, therefore not authorized). 8.1.3.5.2.2.  “Capt DeSantis has excelled in a major’s billet.”  (Refers to a rank higher than the one the individual currently holds). 8.1.3.5.2.3.  “Major Moody should be a group commander now.”  (Recommends the  individual  for  a  position  two  grades  higher  than  the  ratee—not  normal progression). 8.1.3.5.2.4.  “Capt Korte is ready for our toughest field grade jobs.”  (Compares a company grade officer with higher ranking (Field Grade) officers). 8.1.3.5.2.5.  “Already  performing  above  her  current  position.”  (Refers  to  higher grade). 8.1.4.  Responsibilities: 8.1.4.1.  The Senior Rater: 8.1.4.1.1.  Reviews the  ratee's  Officer’s  Command  Selection  Records  Group (OCSRGp), decoration citations, Duty Qualification History Brief (DQHB) and UIF (if applicable) before preparing the PRF.  May consider other reliable information about duty performance and conduct except as paragraph 1.12. or other regulatory guidance prohibits.  Examples of other reliable information may include but are not limited to LOEs, bullets from a draft OPR and/or decoration, etc.  To reference the “other reliable information” in their record, the officer meeting the board may submit a letter to the CSB.  Do not use any other Single Uniform Request Formats (SURFs) other than those indicated above when preparing the PRF (i.e., AMS SURFs).  NOTE:  The intent of the "other reliable information" passage is to allow SRs to comment on performance accomplishments since the close-out of the last evaluation.  This allows a SR who has personal knowledge of an accomplishment to comment about it in the PRF although not part of the official record yet. 8.1.4.1.2.  Must be knowledgeable of the ratee's most recent performance.  The senior rater may request subordinate supervisors to provide information on an officer's most recent duty performance and performance-based potential and may ask for suggestions based upon the officer's duty performance for PRF recommendations. 8.1.4.1.3.  Will ensure no subordinate commander/supervisor asks or allows, an officer to draft or prepare his or her own PRF.  NOTE:  Eligible officers may provide input. 8.1.4.1.4.  Will ensure there are no boards, meetings or panels of officers convened to collectively score, rate, rank, stratify, produce stratification inputs for use in PRFs, or tally the records and/or generate a priority list of eligible officers unless specifically authorized  by  this  instruction.    NOTE:    Senior  Raters  may  request  subordinate supervisors  provide  their  assessment  (without  the  use  of  any  boards,  meetings,  or panels) of the rank order of officers in their chain of command). AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 225 8.1.4.1.5.  Is solely responsible for evaluating each officer's OCSRGp and DQHB and for either awarding PRF recommendations among officers or submitting officers to compete  for  aggregation  or  carry-over  "DP"  recommendations.    The  senior  rater submits the PRF with Section IX unmarked when submitting an officer for competition in aggregation or carry-over categories at an MLR and/or HQ USAF review. 8.1.4.1.6.  Completes promotion recommendations.  Corrects any error that results in awarding more "DP" recommendations than allocated by the ML.  However, if he or she fails to fulfill this responsibility, the management level review president makes the appropriate corrections, to include re-accomplishing a PRF a senior rater prepared. 8.1.4.1.7.  Provides the ratee a copy of the PRF (hand-delivered or sent in a sealed envelope clearly marked, “To Be Opened By Addressee Only”) approximately 30 days before the CSB.  The reason for this is twofold: 8.1.4.1.7.1.  Advise the ratee of the senior rater’s promotion recommendation. 8.1.4.1.7.2.  Provide  the  ratee  an  opportunity  to  point  out  any  typographical, administrative or errors of fact to the senior rater so they may be corrected prior to the CSB.  NOTE:  If the ratee is geographically separated, send it to the ratee by “return receipt requested” mail.  Contact the MPS for assistance if necessary. 8.1.4.1.8.  Will ensure the PRF remains a private matter with access being only between the senior rater, the ratee, senior rater administrative support staff if senior rater desires (i.e. executive officer, secretary, MPS), the MLR, and the CSB.  Subordinate evaluators or others may have access to a PRF’s comments or rating only if permitted by the ratee.  NOTE:  No officer eligible for a particular board will be involved with the PRF process for that particular board. 8.1.4.1.9.  Must attach a memo (Figure 8.1) telling the ratee who receives a PRF with a “DNP” recommendation that he or she has the right to submit a letter to the CSB. 8.1.4.1.10.  Considers  preparing  a  PRF  on  a  newly  assigned  eligible  officer  who received an outright "P" recommendation from his or her previous senior rater, (an outright “P” is someone who received a promote recommendation from the senior rater and was not competed at a MLR).  The exception is AF-level students meeting the AF Student MLR, and whose effective date of duty as a result of PCS or PCA to a new senior rater occurs after the PRF accounting date, but on or before the PRF cutoff date.  See paragraph 8.4.1. 8.1.4.1.11.  Provides a signed master eligibility list (MEL) of officers considered for promotion recommendations to the ML. 8.1.4.1.12.  Ensures the ML receives PRFs as required by paragraph 8.1.5. 8.1.4.1.13.  Ensures  his  or  her  SRID  in  Air  Force  Promotion  System  (AFPROMS) reflects only his or her eligible officers NLT 105 days before the CSB. 8.1.4.1.14.  Evaluates all additions to and deletions from the MEL through their MPSs to their ML (i.e., officers who are gains as a result of a PCA/PCS movement occurring prior to the PRF accounting date or officers initially assigned to the wrong PAS code and SRID). 226 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 8.1.4.1.15.  Officers  Added  or  Deleted  from  Promotion  Eligibility.    This  paragraph applies to officers who become eligible or ineligible for promotion consideration in a particular  competitive  category  on  or  after  the  PRF  accounting  date.    Causes  for  a change in eligibility status may include:  SSB or Air Force Board for Correction of Military  Records  (AFBCMR)  actions,  administrative  errors,  changes  in  DOS,  or similar circumstances. 8.1.4.1.15.1.  For  officers  whose  eligibility  for  promotion  consideration  is established after the PRF accounting date, the senior rater of record at the time eligibility is established will write the PRF. 8.1.4.1.15.2.  If the PRF is written after the senior rater completes the rank ordering (Day-66) and determines that a “DP” should be awarded, then place a “1” in block VI for BPZ/IPZ officer, or place a “0” in block VI for APZ officers.  See Table 8.2. 8.1.4.2.  The MPS. 8.1.4.2.1.  Assists the ML in verifying accuracy of SRIDs and PAS codes. 8.1.4.2.2.  Provides two copies of PRF notices, a MEL, and a DQHB on each eligible officer to the senior raters.  NOTE:  For officers not located with the SR, provide these documents to eligible officers servicing MPS to be used in preparing PRF inputs for the SR. 8.1.4.2.3.  Provides other senior rater support and review as requested (sends PRFs to the appropriate ML when requested by the senior raters). 8.1.4.2.4.  Makes OCSRGps available to senior raters, to include records of officers serviced by other MPSs. 8.1.4.2.5.  Reviews PRFs to ensure administrative accuracy, when requested. 8.1.4.2.6.  Processes narrative-only PRFs.  (See paragraph 8.1.5.6 ). 8.1.4.2.7.  Advises senior raters when officers change promotion eligibility status after PRF allocation date (Day 66).  (See paragraph 8.1.4.1.15.) 8.1.4.2.8.  Ensures  senior  raters  are  provided  a  listing  of  newly  assigned  eligible officers.    NOTE:    RIPs  are  produced  in  AFPROMS,  ensure  SR  validate  RIPs  by signing them and keep on file until public release. 8.1.4.2.9.  Evaluates any potential adds or deletions to the MELs for the senior raters and MLs they service.  (See paragraph 8.1.4.1.14). 8.1.4.2.10.  Monitors AFPROMS Audit Transactions at least twice a week to identify any board adds, deletions, SRID changes, PCS/PCA/DAS actions. 8.1.4.2.11.  Coordinates with ML and senior raters as needed. 8.1.4.2.12.  Check AFPROMS news daily. 8.1.4.2.13.  Upon receipt of PRFs following the USAF Student MLR, distribute these PRFs to the eligible officers.  See paragraph 8.1.4.1.7.   AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 227 8.1.4.3.  The ML. 8.1.4.3.1.  Designates senior rater positions for all units within their jurisdiction and assigns SRIDs to those positions. 8.1.4.3.2.  Identifies officers occupying those senior rater positions by name, assigns them SRIDs by name and PAS code and ensures AFPROMS is updated accordingly. 8.1.4.3.3.  Validates  SRID  alignment  in  MilPDS  with  PAS  code.    NOTE:    Ensure MilPDS is updated accordingly, contact AFPC for any assistance. 8.1.4.3.4.

Coordinates with senior raters, MPSs, and HQ AFPC/DP2SPE as needed. 8.1.4.3.15.  Monitors AFPROMS news daily. 8.1.4.3.16.  Ensures  the  SecAF  Memorandum  of  Instruction  (MOI),  available  on myPers, is referenced and utilized for all MLR and SR promotion processes within their purview.  The MOI provides instructions to all MLs and SRs to ensure decision makers throughout the officer promotion process are focused on the same priorities and special emphasis areas as the CSB. 8.1.4.4.  HQ AFPC/DP2SPE. 228 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 8.1.4.4.1.  Establishes  and  announces  PRF  eligibility  criteria  and  administrative requirements for processing PRFs. 8.1.4.4.2.  Ensures completed PRFs are disposed of in accordance with paragraph 8.1.5. 8.1.4.4.3.  Flows PRF Notices and DQHBs approximately 120 days prior to the CSB in AFPROMS. 8.1.4.4.4.  Processes  all  SRID  changes  with  multiple  MLs  involved.    NOTE:    It remains the initiating MLs responsibility to obtain all concurrences for other affected MLs prior to submission to AFPC. 8.1.4.5.  The Ratee. 8.1.4.5.1.  Contacts the senior rater if they have not received a copy of their PRF NLT 15 days prior to CSB.  Prior to the CSB, the ratee must contact the senior rater to discuss any inaccuracies, omissions or errors pertaining to their PRF. 8.1.4.5.2.  Ensures their record is current and accurate. 8.1.4.5.3.  May correspond by letter with the CSB and address any matter of record concerning themselves that they believe important to their consideration.  Letters must be submitted in good faith and contain accurate information to the best of the ratee’s knowledge and must be signed by the ratee. 8.1.4.5.4.  Air Force Level students/patients (SRID “ST101”) eligible for promotion may  write  a  letter  to  the  Air  Force  Student  MLR  to  address  any  matter  of  record concerning themselves that they believe important to their consideration.  Letters must be submitted in good faith and contain accurate information to the best of the ratee’s knowledge  and  must  be  signed  by  the  ratee.    The  letters  will  be  destroyed  upon conclusion of the Student MLR and will not be forwarded to the CSB. 8.1.5.  Processing and Use of the PRF. 8.1.5.1.  MPSs send PRF notices and MELs to senior raters upon receipt, normally day 120 prior to the CSB. 8.1.5.2.  Senior raters sign completed PRFs on or after the PRF cutoff date.  Senior raters who intend to compete in aggregation (see paragraph 8.3.1.10), or carry-over (8.3.1.9), must prepare and sign the PRFs, leaving Section IX blank. 8.1.5.3.  Senior raters will submit all completed I/APZ PRFs for quality review and ensure all BPZ PRFs are available for AFPROMS update by the ML no later than 40 days before the CSB. 8.1.5.4.  The ML sends completed PRFs to HQ AFPC/DP2SPE, 550 C Street West Suite 7, Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph TX 78150-4705 to arrive no later than 30 days before the  CSB.    MLs  forward  PRFs  for  non-line  aggregate  and  carry-over  officers  to  HQ AFPC/DP2SPE, 550 C Street West Suite 7, Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph TX 78150-4709, with the “Overall Recommendation” left blank, to arrive NLT 35 days prior to the CSB. 8.1.5.5.  HQ  AFPC/PB  ensures  the  removal  of  the  PRFs  from  the  OSR  immediately following the CSB and forwards them to HQ AFPC/DP1ORM to be placed on optical disk.  AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 229 DP1ORM destroys the PRFs after imaging.  PRFs filed on optical disk have limited access.  Do not use them for assignments, promotions (except Special Selection Boards [SSB]), or other personnel actions.  Retain these PRFs for historical, legal, and appeal purposes only. 8.1.5.6.  Narrative-only/Recommendation-only PRFs. 8.1.5.6.1.  MPSs are responsible for processing  N-O PRFs and  ensuring all eligible officers receive a copy of their N-O PRF prior to departure for PCS.  NOTE:  Officers will not depart without a N-O PRF being accomplished unless an approved waiver was granted IAW paragraph 8.1.5.6.4.1. 8.1.5.6.2.  The senior rater sends the N-O PRF to the MPS no later than 30 days prior to the officer departing PCA or PCS for school.  NOTE:  An officer may become eligible for BPZ or I/APZ consideration by a CSB before departing for school.  In this case, both a narrative-only PRF and a regular PRF (see paragraph 8.1.2.3.) must be prepared.  An officer may also be eligible for two or more promotion boards while in AF-level student status, depending on the length of training.  Since N-O PRFs are not board  specific,  statements  such  as  “My  #1  BPZ”  may  become  outdated  before  the officer meets a promotion board, however this should not preclude the senior rater from stratifying the officers as he would on a regular PRF. 8.1.5.6.3.  The senior rater sends the N-O PRFs to the MPS for officers in patient or Missing in Action (MIA)/Prisoner of War (POW) status.  The MPS will process the PRF to HQ AFPC/DP2SPE no later than 60 days after the officer enters this new status. 8.1.5.6.4.  The MPS forwards the original PRFs to HQ AFPC/DP2SPE NLT 30 days after the officer departs and updates a code “B” in MilPDS.  The MPS maintains copies of the PRFs until PRF receipt is confirmed by an update of NAR PRF Flag to code “C” in MilPDS by HQ AFPC/DP2SPE.  MPSs can verify that the “C” code is updated under officer grade data/grade miscellaneous in PDS.  Once confirmed, the MPS destroys its copies.  All N-O PRF waiver requests will be worked directly with HQ AFPC/DP2SPE.  See PSD Handbook for update instructions. 8.1.5.6.4.1.  All  N-O  PRF  waiver  requests  will  be  worked  directly  with  HQ AFPC/DP2SPE. 8.1.5.6.4.2.  When  requesting  N-O  PRF  waivers,  please  include  the  following information:  Full name, SSN, DOR, competitive category, projected graduation date, and reason for the request.  NOTE:  As waivers are reviewed using current schedules, should an officer become eligible after a waiver has been granted, the N-O PRF will then be required from the senior rater whom was in the position when the officer departed for school.  Only if the senior rater is not available (retired and unable to be contacted or deceased, etc.) will the current senior rater in the position be authorized to sign the N-O PRF after the officer departed. 8.1.5.6.5.  Senior raters provide a copy of the N-O PRF to the ratee approximately 30 days prior to departure for AF level training/patient status.   230 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 8.1.5.6.6.  HQ  AFPC/DP2SPE  maintains  N-O  PRFs  until  officers  leave  student, patient, or MIA/POW status.  HQ AFPC/DP2SPE destroys narrative-only PRFs when the officer no longer competes as a student. HQ AFPC/DP2SPE maintains the N-O PRFs until distributed as specified below: 8.1.5.6.6.1.  HQ AFPC/DP2SPE forwards the N-O PRF to the HQ USAF Student MLR.  After completion of the recommendation-only PRFs (which are attached to the narrative-only PRFs), HQ AFPC/DP2SPE forwards the N-O PRF and R-O PRF to the official record (ARMS) for inclusion in the OSR and provides copies to ratees via the ratees’ servicing MPS. 8.1.5.6.6.2.  HQ  AFPC/DP2SPE  maintains  the  original  narrative-only  PRF  in  a separate file for use during future promotion consideration as a student.  Exceptions to the disposition of PRFs must be approved by HQ AFPC/DP2SPE and be in the best interest of the officer and the Air Force. 8.1.5.6.6.3.  Immediately after completion of the CSB, HQ AFPC/PB removes the PRFs from the OSR and forwards them to HQ AFPC/DP1ORM for placement on optical disk. 8.1.5.7.  The HQ USAF Student MLR (see paragraph 8.3.5.2.2.) prepares R-O PRFs and attaches them to the student N-O PRFs. 8.2.  AF Form 709 (for Reserve Active Status List officers). 8.2.1.  Reserve of the Air Force.  Use AF Form 709 for promotion to lieutenant colonel and colonel. Refer to paragraph 8.6. for recommending colonels for promotion to the grade of brigadier general.  AFR will use AF Form 709 for Position Vacancy promotion nomination to all grades.  HQ ARPC/PB will issue instructions specific to each board. 8.2.1.1.  Mandatory Boards. An eligible officer’s senior rater completes the PRF no later than 45 days prior to the CSB.  The senior rater awards one of three recommendations: 8.2.1.2.  A  “Definitely  Promote”  (“DP”)  recommendation:    The  strength  of  the  ratee’s performance and performance-based potential warrants promotions. 8.2.1.3.  A “Promote” (“P”) recommendation means the ratee is qualified for promotion and should compete on the basis of performance, performance-based potential, and other considerations such as duty history, developmental education, advanced degrees, etc. 8.2.1.4.  A “Do Not Promote This Board” (“DNP”) recommendation:  The strength of the ratee’s performance and performance-based potential does not warrant promotion by the CSB for which the officer is eligible.  A senior rater must make comments explaining to the CSB why the officer should not be promoted. 8.2.1.5.  The ResAF is not constrained by the number of “DPs” it can award.  A senior rater may award as many “DPs” as desired. 8.2.2.  Completing the PRF.  See Table 8.1. for specific guidance on preparing PRFs.    AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 231 8.2.3.  Responsibilities: 8.2.3.1.  The Senior Rater: 8.2.3.1.1.  Reviews  the  ratee's  OPRs,  decoration  citations,  DQHB,  PIF,  and  UIF  (if applicable)  before  preparing  the  PRF.    They  may  also  consider  other  reliable information about duty performance and conduct except as outlined in paragraph 1.12. or other regulatory guidance.  Examples of other reliable information may include but are not limited to LOE, bullets from a draft OPR and/or decoration, etc.  To reference the  “other  reliable  information”  in  their  record,  the  officer  meeting  the  board  may submit a letter to the CSB.  NOTE:  Do not use any other SURFs other than those indicated above when preparing the PRF (i.e. AMS SURFs). The intent of the "other reliable  information"  passage  is  to  allow  SRs  to  comment  on  performance accomplishments since the close-out of the last evaluation.  This allows a SR who has personal knowledge of an accomplishment to comment about it in the PRF although not part of the official record yet.  The senior rater of record on the PRF accounting date will write the PRF. 8.2.3.1.2.  May obtain information on an officer’s most recent duty performance and performance-based  potential  from  subordinate  or  previous  supervisors  and  may consider  their  suggestions  based  upon  the  officer’s  duty  performance  for  PRF recommendations.  No officer will be asked to draft or prepare his or her own PRF.  There will be no boards or panels of officers convened to collectively score, rate, rank, or tally the records and/or generate a priority list of eligible officers. 8.2.3.1.3.  Is solely responsible for evaluating each officer’s ROP and DQHB, to award recommendations. 8.2.3.1.4.  Completes promotion recommendations. 8.2.3.1.5.  Provides the ratee a copy of the PRF (hand-delivered or sent in a sealed envelope clearly marked, “To Be Opened By Addressee Only”) approximately 30 days before the CSB.   PRFs  are  a private matter between the senior  rater and the ratee.  Subordinate  evaluators  may  have  access  to  a  PRF  rating  to  assist  in  the  feedback process only if desired by the ratee.  The senior rater must attach a memo (Figure 8.1) telling the ratee who receives a PRF with a “DNP” recommendation that he or she has the right to submit a letter to the CSB.  The ratee must acknowledge receipt of the memorandum.  If the ratee is geographically separated, send it to the ratee by “return receipt requested” mail.  Contact the MPS for assistance, if necessary. 8.2.3.2.  The MPS or HQ ARPC/PB (as applicable): 8.2.3.2.1.  Verifies accuracy of SRIDs and PAS codes. 8.2.3.2.2.  Provides  to  senior  raters  the  PRF  notice,  a  MEL,  and  a  DQHB  on  each eligible officer. 8.2.3.2.3.  Provides  other  senior  rater  support  as  requested  (sends  PRFs  to  the appropriate ML as requested by senior raters). 8.2.3.2.4.  Makes ROPs available to senior raters, to include records of officers serviced by other MPSs. 232 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 8.2.3.2.5.  Reviews PRFs to ensure administrative accuracy, when requested. 8.2.3.2.6.  Informs senior raters when officers have a change in promotion eligibility status after the PRF accounting date. 8.2.3.2.7.  Provides senior raters a listing of newly assigned eligible officers. 8.2.3.3.  HQ ARPC/PB.  Will announce PRF criteria for ResAF CSBs. 8.2.4.  Processing and Use of PRFs. 8.2.4.1.  MPSs send PRF notices and MELs to senior raters upon receipt, usually just after the PRF accounting date. 8.2.4.2.  The senior rater will complete the PRF in enough time to arrive at HQ ARPC not later than 45 days before the CSB. 8.2.4.3.  HQ ARPC/PB posts the OSRs from eBOSS back to ARMS.  The PRF becomes part of the as-met records for the officer’s future reference. 8.2.5.  Officers  Relocating  During  the  PRF  Process.    To  ensure  officers  with  a  change  in assignment to a new senior rater effective after the PRF accounting date, but on or before the CSB, receive full consideration for their PRF, special provisions apply.  For ANG/AFR, the senior rater of record on the PRF accounting date will write the PRF and award performance rating. 8.2.5.1.  To provide these officers fair consideration, the losing and gaining senior raters may discuss the officer’s performance and their intentions (via phone, memo, etc.). 8.2.5.2.  Award a “DNP” recommendation when derogatory information has been received since  departure  from  previous  assignment.  If  the  losing  senior  rater  awards  a  “DNP” recommendation, the gaining senior rater has no further action.  A senior rater must make specific comments to support the DNP recommendation in Section IV of the PRF. 8.2.5.3.  The MPS or HQ ARPC/PB (as appropriate) will: 8.2.5.3.1.  Screen  all  officers  gained  after  the  PRF  accounting  date  to  determine eligibility  and  notify  senior  raters  accordingly  (refer  to  AFPROMS  user’s  guide).  Ensure senior raters certify a review of all gained eligibles. 8.2.5.3.2.  Provide the senior rater a DQHB on newly assigned officers. 8.2.5.3.3.  Update corrections to SRIDs on officers who arrive at new locations on or before the PRF accounting date.  Notify HQ ARPC/PB when an update to AFPROMS is needed. 8.2.6.  Officers added to Promotion Eligibility.  This paragraph applies to officers who become eligible for promotion consideration or change component or competitive categories on or after the PRF accounting date.  Cause for a change in eligibility may include (but is not limited to): ANG  to  AFR  transfer;  AFR  to  ANG  transfer;  change  from  Participating  Reserve  to  Non-Participating  Reserve  or  Non-Participating  Reserve  to  Participating  Reserve;  change  from active duty list to Reserve active status list (without a break in military status); change from other branch of service to USAF Reserve active status list; change in DOS; administrative errors; SSB or AFBCMR actions; or similar circumstances. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 233 8.2.7.  Ranking of Definitely Promotes.  Enter the rank order for all officers awarded a “DP” recommendation  within  each  competitive  category,  e.g.  line,  judge  advocate,  nurse  corps, etc.  EXAMPLE:  2/5/10; the senior rater has 10 officers in that competitive category meeting the Promotion Selection Board.  The officer is ranked number 2 of 5 officers awarded a DP. For officers awarded other than a DP, leave GROUP SIZE blank.  For officers gained after completion of PRFs, to which the SR chooses to award a DP, the ranking will be 1/1/1. For a Position Vacancy (PV) Board, enter the rank order for all officers nominated for PV within each competitive category.  EXAMPLE:  3/5; the senior rater has 5 officers in that competitive category meeting the PV Promotion Selection Board.  This officer is ranked number three of five officers awarded a DP. 8.2.8.  Prisoners, Deserters, and Officers on Appellate Leave.  Do not accomplish PRFs for officers who become prisoners or deserters, or who are on appellate leave on or before the PRF accounting date. HQ ARPC/DPTSE will prepare an AF Form 77.  However, officers identified as prisoners, deserters, or on appellate leave after the PRF accounting date will require PRFs from the losing senior rater.  His or her total number of eligibles will include these officers. 8.2.9.  Air Force Advisors for PRFs.  If the senior rater on the PRF is not an Air Force officer or DAF official, an Air Force advisor is designated to advise evaluators on matters pertaining to PRFs.  Normally, this will be the same officer who conducts the review of the officer’s OPR.  The Air Force advisor will not change any statements or the promotion recommendation on the PRF. 8.2.10.  Promotion Recommendations for Colonels.  See paragraph 8.6 for AFR general officer CSB or an ANGUS Federal Recognition Board information and instruction. 8.2.11.  AGR Officers in Student Status.  The Deputy to the Chief of Air Reserve (Deputy RE) is the senior rater for AGR students only (AFR only). 8.2.11.1.  When an AGR officer leaves for a school tour, the losing senior rater will prepare a PRF as if the officer is still assigned.  The PRF will be signed, but blocks VI, Group Size; VII, Board; and IX, Overall Recommendation will remain blank.  The PRF follows the officer to the next assignment, and a copy is sent to HQ USAF/REPS. 8.2.11.2.  If, while in student status, the officer becomes eligible for consideration by a promotion board, the N-O PRF is sent to the Deputy RE for a R-O PRF. 8.2.11.3.  The Deputy RE prepares the R-O PRF according to Table 8.1.  and rank orders all officers awarded a “DP” recommendation by competitive category within the student population.  EXAMPLE:  1/2/2 rank order means the senior rater has two officers in that competitive category meeting the selection board; the officer is ranked number one of the two “DPs” awarded.  NOTE:  Student AGR PRFs are not included within the SRID that applies to the Chief of Air Force Reserve. 8.2.11.4.  The  N-O  PRF  is  attached  to  the  signed  R-O  PRF,  and  is  forwarded  to  the promotion secretariat at the Air Reserve Personnel Center. 8.3.  MLRs (ADL Lieutenant Colonel and Below). 8.3.1.  The Allocation Process: 8.3.1.1.  Definitely Promote.  “DP” recommendations are limited in number to ensure only the most qualified records are endorsed.  They send a strong signal to the CSB that the 234 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 officer is ready for immediate promotion. “DP” allocation rates for IPZ and APZ officers are lower than the IPZ promotion opportunity; this ensures a significant number of officers receiving “P” recommendations will be promoted. MLs receive a share of “DP” allocations based  on  the  number  of  IPZ  or  BPZ  officers  assigned.    Allocation  rates  vary  for  each competitive category, grade and promotion zone, and may fluctuate according to changes in  the  promotion  opportunity  to  guarantee  the  minimum  promotion  rate  for  eligibles receiving a “P” recommendation (40% to major, 35% to lieutenant colonel and 25% to colonel); this is called the promotion rate (P-Rate).  Allocation rates for BPZ officers are higher  than  the  BPZ  promotion  opportunity  to  ensure  all  senior  raters  have  the  same opportunity  to  nominate  their  most  deserving  officers  for  an  early  promotion  with  the limited number of BPZ promotions available.  HQ AFPC/DP2SPE publicizes the “DP” allocation rates for each PRF cycle in the Day 66 message. 8.3.1.2.  PRF Accounting Date (150 days before the CSB).  On the PRF accounting date, AFPC matches eligible officers to SRs based on the officers’ unit of assignment data in MilPDS.  HQ AFPC/DP2SPE announces the actual PRF accounting date.  Between the PRF accounting date and the 66th day before the CSB, MLs ensure AFPROMS is accurate. 8.3.1.3.  PRF Allocation Dates (150/66 days before the CSB).  The initial allocation date is 150 days before the CSB.  This is when MLs estimate the number of allocations available to  each  senior  rater  and  evaluation  board  under  their  jurisdiction.    After  this  date,  the number of allocations is adjusted to account for officers who become eligible or ineligible for promotion and for officers who are still not aligned under the correct SRID as verified and reported by the management level activity to HQ AFPC/DP2SPE.  These adjustments are made up until the day before the PRF final allocation date (which is 66 days before the CSB).  On that day, the ML determines the actual number of allocations and distributes these allocations to SRs and MLRs based on the number of eligible officers for that level.  No changes are made to the number of an ML's allocations on or after the final allocation date unless specifically authorized by HQ AFPC/DP3SP as an exception.  In addition, no changes in the ML’s allocations are authorized in cases where a Brigadier General (Sel) is confirmed by the U.S. Senate on or after day 66 and subsequently becomes eligible to be the SR for lt cols in the organization.  HQ AFPC/DP3SP will approve exceptions in order to maintain integrity in the OES and to ensure fair and proper consideration is given to all affected  officers.    NOTE:    The  DP  Allocations  will  not  be  adjusted  automatically  in AFPROMS for any approved exceptions, these calculations will need to be accomplished manually. 8.3.1.4.  PRF Cutoff Date.  This date is 60 days prior to the CSB.  PRFs cannot be signed prior to this date. 8.3.1.5.  Determining Line of the Air Force (LAF) Allocations. 8.3.1.5.1.  MLs determine the number of "DP" allocations they have by applying the appropriate allocation rate to their IPZ or BPZ eligibles.  Round up fractions to the next whole number, e.g., if an ML has 462 BPZ eligibles and the allocation rate is 10%, the ML earns 47 “DP” allocations (462 BPZ eligibles x 10% allocation rate=46.2 which rounds  up  to  47  allocations).    AFPROMS  should  be  reviewed  to  determine  DP allocation but this should not preclude MLs from doing a manual calculation. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 235 8.3.1.5.2.  Although  the  allocation  rate  for  I/APZ  eligibles  is  different,  the  same procedure applies.  APZ officers do not generate separate allocations.  However, if the ML has only LAF APZ eligibles, then a single “DP” is available.  In this case, the APZ officers would receive a "0" in Section VI on the PRF.  Refer to Table 8.2. 8.3.1.5.3.  MLs receive separate allocations for in-utilization permanent party students. 8.3.1.6.  Determining Senior Rater Allocations. 8.3.1.6.1.  Minimum group size for one DP allocation is at least three eligibles, even if the DP allocation rate is 50% or higher.  See Table 8.3. 8.3.1.6.2.  MLs  determine  each  SRs  share  of  allocations  in  the  same  manner  as discussed  in  paragraph  8.3.1.5.1,  except  instead  of  rounding  up,  SRs  round down.  EXAMPLE:  A 55% allocation rate applied to a SR’s 10 IPZ captains would yield five “DP” allocations (10 IPZ eligibles x 55% allocation rate = 5.5 which rounds down to 5 allocations). 8.3.1.7.  Returning  Allocations.    SRs  may  return  earned  allocations  to  the  ML  if  they believe the quality of officers in their unit does not warrant the full share of allocations.  Additionally, any “DPs” awarded by the senior rater to eligibles that subsequently become ineligible is returned to the SR which may be reallocated using the SRs order of merit or returned to the ML for distribution. 8.3.1.8.  Redistributing “DP” allocations. 8.3.1.8.1.  Prior to the MLR convening, if a SR chooses not to use the full quota of “DPs,” those unused “DPs” go to the carry-over quota. 8.3.1.8.2.  Following  an  MLR,  the  MLR  owns  all  “DPs.”    Any  returned  “DP” allocations for IPZ/APZ eligibles are redistributed through the MLR carry-over process using the carry-over order of merit. 8.3.1.8.3.  BPZ  “DPs”  are  redistributed  at  the  next  higher  level  or  through  the  ML review carry-over process. 8.3.1.8.4.  Redistribution must occur prior to the PRF becoming a matter of record. 8.3.1.9.  Carry-over.  Since allocations are rounded down when applying the allocation rate to a senior rater's eligible population, there are normally fractions of allocations remaining.  These  fractions  accrue  at  the  ML  and  result  in  allocations  called  “carry-over”  DP allocations.  Carry-over allocations (and any returned allocations) are awarded to account for  variations  of  quality  within  organizations  under  the  ML.    For  I/APZ  officers,  MLs distribute allocations to MLRs for award.  For BPZ eligibles, they distribute carry-over allocations directly to senior raters or through the MLR process. 8.3.1.10.  Aggregation. 8.3.1.10.1.  SRs without the minimum number of  I/APZ officers assigned to earn a “DP” in their (SR’s) own right may compete their officers for “DP” recommendations through aggregation.  Grouping of all such officers and the application of the allocation rate yields, after rounding down, the number of “DP” allocations available to officers competing in aggregation.  236 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 EXAMPLE:  If there are 2 SRs in a given ML with eligible officers and each SR has only 1 eligible and the “DP” allocation rate is 65% then: 1 eligible x 65% = 0.65+ 1 eligible x 65% = 0.65 ML total = 1.30 NOTE:  After  rounding  down,  the  ML  earns  1  “DP”  to  award  in  aggregation  and transfers the remaining .30 to carry-over. 8.3.1.10.2.  SRs  without the  minimum  number  of  BPZ  officers  assigned  to  earn  an allocation aggregate their officers to the next higher SR in the rating chain until the number of eligibles is large enough to earn at least one allocation. 8.3.1.10.3.  SRs below the head of the ML who award BPZ "DP" recommendations to eligible officers aggregated from subordinate senior raters' populations must make the promotion  recommendation  decision  without  convening  a  board  or  panel  of subordinates. 8.3.1.10.3.1.  If  aggregation  proceeds  to  the  ML  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of paragraph 8.3.1.10.2 , the head of the ML may:  NOTE:  For Joint MLs, all PRFs (including  BPZ)  must  be  quality  reviewed  and  the  quality  review  process  is extremely important in every ML during the IPZ/APZ  process.  See paragraph 8.3.2.4.2.2.: 8.3.1.10.3.1.1.  Personally distribute DPs on their own. 8.3.1.10.3.1.2.  May  convene  MLRs  and  allow  the  MLRs  to  score  records determining the DPs awarded based on order of merit. 8.3.1.10.3.1.3.  Can  convene  a  MLR,  seek  inputs,  and  still  make  all  final decisions on DPs awarded. 8.3.1.10.4.  If the total number of line BPZ officers aggregated to the MLR is still too small  to  earn  a  “DP”  allocation,  all  panel  members,  not  just  those  with  officers competing for aggregation, score the records of the officers in the aggregated group and may award one “DP” recommendation.  If awarded, this “DP” allocation will come from the carry-over allocation. 8.3.1.11.  Determining Non-line of the Air Force and Line of the Air Force Judge Advocate (LAF-J) allocations. Non-line (Chaplain [HC], Medical Corps [MC], Dental Corps [DC], Nurse Corps [NC], Biomedical Sciences Corps [BSC], and Medical Service Corps [MSC]) and LAF-J officers compete for promotion within their own separate competitive category. 8.3.1.11.1.  Minimum group size for one “DP” allocation is three eligibles, even if the DP allocation rate is 50% or higher.  For allocation rates below 35%, the minimum group size will increase relative to the DP allocation rate. 8.3.1.11.2.  MLs  determine  the  number  of  “DP”  allocations  in  the  same  manner  as discussed  in  paragraph  8.3.1.5.1  and  8.3.1.5.2  ,  except  MLs  round  down  when computing I/APZ allocations and round up when computing BPZ allocations.  If the ML does not have enough IPZ eligibles to earn an allocation, the MLR may submit I/APZ officers to compete at the Air Force Management Level Review for non-line officers, subject to the limits established by HQ AFPC/DP2SPE. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 237 8.3.1.11.3.  Allocation  rates  applied  to  non-line  I/APZ  and  BPZ  officers  within competitive categories may be different from those applied to line officers.  Changes in promotion opportunity will cause adjustment of allocation rates. 8.3.1.11.4.  SRs without enough BPZ or I/APZ eligible officers to receive an allocation may submit their officers to compete for aggregation allocations at their ML review, subject to limits established by the ML. 8.3.1.11.5.  SRs may submit their officers to compete for carry-over allocations at the MLR, subject to the limits established by the ML.  The MLR may submit I/APZ officers to  compete  for  carry-over  allocations  at  the  Air  Force  MLR  for  non-line  officers, subject to the limits established by HQ AFPC/DP2SPE. 8.3.1.12.  Determining Non-Line SR Allocations.  SR compute allocation rates as they do for line officers, by rounding down for both I/APZ and BPZ officers. If SRs do not have enough I/APZ eligible officers to receive an allocation, they may compete them for “DP” recommendations  through  aggregation  at  the  ML.    SR  who  do  not  have  enough  BPZ officers assigned to earn an allocation aggregate their officers to the next higher senior rater in  the  rating  chain  until  the  number  of  eligibles  is  large  enough  to  earn  at  least  one allocation. 8.3.2.  MLR Requirements: 8.3.2.1.  General.  MLs  designate  the  organization  or  agency  responsible  for  holding  a review.  The commander or head of the designated organization holds the MLR and may establish more than one MLR (e.g., at the Numbered Air Force level or Center level).  If the head of the ML is the sole SR, there is no MLR and the completed PRFs are forwarded to USAF MLR for quality review. 8.3.2.2.  Timing and functions.  Conduct MLRs 60 to 40 days before the CSB.  They have five functions:  (1) to quality review all I/APZ PRFs; (2) to award “DP” recommendations to those officers whose SR had too few eligibles to earn a “DP” allocation; (3) to award carry-over “DP” allocations available to the ML; (4) to award “DP” allocations to ML students; and (5) to nominate non-line officers from their ML to compete for DP allocations available at the HQ USAF Non-line MLR. 8.3.2.3.  Composition:  President (must be an Air Force line officer), those SRs who have either  awarded  a  “DP”  recommendation  or  have  officers  competing  for  aggregation  or carry-over  “DP”  recommendations,  and  a  nonvoting  recorder  designated  by  the commander or head of the organization responsible for conducting the MLR.  NOTE:  No officer eligible for a particular board will be involved with the process for that particular board. 8.3.2.3.1.  The head of the ML designates the MLR president.  The president must be an  AF  GO  when  evaluating  lieutenant  colonels,  and  at  least  an  AF  colonel  when evaluating majors and below. 8.3.2.3.2.  In  cases  where  SRs  are  not  available  to  serve  on  the  panel  due  to  some extraordinary circumstance, the head of the ML may authorize SRs to designate senior officials  who  meet  the  minimum  grade  requirement  (a  GO  or  equivalent  when evaluating  lieutenant  colonels  or  at  least  a  colonel  or  equivalent  when  evaluating 238 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 majors and below) from their organization or higher chain of command to serve on their behalf. 8.3.2.3.3.  If extraordinary circumstances require a SR’s departure during the MLR, the MLR president or another SR, as designated by the affected SR, may represent him or her.  In all cases, the MLR president or SR designated to represent another group of officers is still limited to one vote.  Additionally, if extraordinary circumstances require the MLR president to depart during an MLR, the head of the ML will designate another MLR president or assume the MLR presidency.  In these cases, the records already scored will remain and the MLR will continue. 8.3.2.3.4.  MLs may establish a representative sample of SRs to conduct the quality review of the I/APZ PRFs and OCSRGps at the MLR.  At the discretion of the ML, all SRs who awarded a “DP” or who are competing officers for a “DP” recommendation do not need to participate in the quality review process at the MLR. 8.3.2.3.4.1.  All SRs with eligibles competing for an aggregation “DP” must serve as a member of the MLR during the aggregation phase.  However, in those cases where  SRs  are  not  available  to  serve  on  the  MLR  due  to  some  extraordinary circumstance, the MLR president may authorize SRs to designate senior officials (a GO or equivalent when evaluating lieutenant colonels or at least a colonel or equivalent when evaluating majors and below) from their organization or higher chain of command to serve on their behalf.  If necessary, the MLR President may represent those SRs, however the MLR President is still limited to one vote.  If during the MLR a senior rater must be excused, the SR may designate another SR already attending the MLR or the MLR president to act on their behalf, however, the MLR president or another senior rater which was designated is still limited to one vote. 8.3.2.3.4.2.  When practical, all SRs competing officers for carry-over “DPs” attend the  MLR.    If  the  ML  determines  this  is  not  practical  or  deems  it  otherwise appropriate, it may establish a representative sample of SRs to award carry-over “DPs.”  The ML uses a representative sample to ensure the SRs selected do not score the records of officers for whom they are the SR. 8.3.2.4.  MLR Preparation. 8.3.2.4.1.  MLs. 8.3.2.4.1.1.  Establish MLRs. 8.3.2.4.1.2.  Distribute aggregation and carry-over “DP” allocations to the MLR. 8.3.2.4.1.3.  Notify  each  SR  of the  number  of  officers  he  or  she  may  submit  to compete for carry-over allocations subject to limits established by the ML. 8.3.2.4.1.4.  Ensure  MLRs  are  completed  no  earlier  than  60  or  no  later  than  40 calendar days before convening of the CSB for which the PRFs are prepared. 8.3.2.4.1.5.  Determine the location of the MLR (normally held where performance records on the officers being considered are available).  AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 239 8.3.2.4.1.6.  Ensure the OCSRGp and DQHB for each officer are available for the review. 8.3.2.4.1.7.  Ensure  the  MLR  president  is  provided  a  listing  of  eligible  officers, identifying those with UIFs, LORs and/or Articles 15.  MLR presidents use this list at their discretion to ensure senior raters (and MLR members, when appropriate) have  considered  this  information  when  preparing  promotion  recommendation forms. 8.3.2.4.1.8.  Establish scoring procedure for MLRs. 8.3.2.4.2.  MLR Purpose and Process: 8.3.2.4.2.1.  Ensure SRs do not exceed their share of “DP” recommendations. 8.3.2.4.2.2.  Ensure all BPZ records are reviewed separately from I/APZ eligibles. 8.3.2.4.2.3.  Quality review the OCSRGps, DQHBs and PRFs of all I/APZ officers in order to identify and discuss with appropriate SRs those PRFs that appear to contain exaggerated or unrealistic comments or comments that do not appear to support  the  overall  recommendation  based  on  the  OCSRGp  and  information considered according to paragraph 1.12.  NOTE:  DP recommendations are limited in  number  to  ensure  that  only  the  best  qualified  records  are  endorsed.    A  DP recommendation  sends  a  strong  signal  to  the  CSB  that  this  officer  is  ready  for immediate promotion.  If a SR or Head of the ML does not have officers fitting this definition, a DP should not be awarded even though DPs may be available.  To award DPs to BPZ when the record does not support a DP recommendation, gives the officer unrealistic feedback and sends mixed signals to the CSB. 8.3.2.4.2.4.  Award  “DP”  recommendations  to  I/APZ  officers  aggregated  from units with less than minimum group size needed for senior raters to award “DP” recommendations. 8.3.2.4.2.5.  Award carry-over “DP” recommendations to I/APZ officers. 8.3.2.4.3.  Senior Raters: 8.3.2.4.3.1.  Serve as members of the MLR. 8.3.2.4.3.2.  Submit  PRFs  to  the  MLR  on  all  I/APZ  officers  including  officers competing for aggregation and carry-over “DP” recommendations.  NOTE:  Since BPZ records are not required to be quality reviewed, SRs must submit their BPZ PRFs to the ML for update. 8.3.2.4.3.3.  Submit to the MLR recorder a single list of the names of their I/APZ officers.  For those officers on the list with completed PRFs, include name and overall  promotion  recommendation;  for  those  officers  on  the  list  submitted  to compete for aggregation or carry-over, indicate whether competing for aggregation or carry-over “DP” recommendations by annotating a “A” for aggregation or “C” for carryover. 8.3.2.5.  Review Procedures. 8.3.2.5.1.  General Procedures. 240 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 8.3.2.5.1.1.  For all MLRs, the recorder provides to the MLR president the total number of “DP” recommendations to be awarded by each SR. 8.3.2.5.1.2.  The MLR president ensures no SR exceeds the allowable number of “DP” recommendations.  If a SR has awarded more “DP” recommendations than allowed, the SR specifies which PRFs need correction, new PRFs are prepared, and the SR completes Sections IX and X. 8.3.2.5.1.2.1.  If the SR does not specify which PRFs need correcting, the panel reviews  the  OCSRGps  and  DQHBs  of  all  officers  assigned  to  that  SR  to determine  which  overall  recommendations  need  changing.    The  panel  then prepares a new PRF, with Sections I through VIII copied verbatim from the original PRF submitted by the SR. 8.3.2.5.1.2.2.  The MLR president marks the "Promote" block in section IX of the re-accomplished PRF and signs the form.  NOTE:  The president will leave Section IX blank when the officer competes under aggregation or carry-over. 8.3.2.5.1.2.3.  The panel will change the minimum number of PRFs required to ensure compliance with prescribed “DP” limits. 8.3.2.5.1.2.4.  The records of any officer whose PRF is re-accomplished under this  provision  will “DP” recommendations. automatically carry-over compete for 8.3.2.5.2.  PRF  Review.  MLR  members  will  review  the  OCSRGps,  DQHBs  and completed PRFs of all I/APZ officers assigned to a SR as a group.  If the MLR believes a “DP” recommendation is unsupported by the ratee's OCSRGp, they discuss this with the SR. Open discussion among MLR members is encouraged.  In all cases, a SR has the final authority to determine the content of the PRFs they prepare (unless the content is  inappropriate  IAW  paragraph  1.12.  of  this  instruction),  and  to  award  “DP” recommendations allocated by the ML. 8.3.2.5.3.  Aggregation  and  Carry-over.    The  MLR  assesses  the  relative  merit  of OCSRGps of competitors for aggregation and carry-over “DP” recommendations.  This is by a combination of numerical scoring and open discussion among panel members.  The MLR must ensure consistent and equitable procedures apply to the OCSRG of each  officer.    The  scores  of  all  MLR  members  are  totaled,  rank-ordered  and  “DP” recommendations  awarded.    If  two  or  more  records  tie,  and  there  are  insufficient numbers  of  “DP”  recommendations  to  award  one  to  each,  the  MLR  President  will determine an appropriate method for breaking the tie. 8.3.2.5.4.  Procedures for Award of I/APZ Aggregation “DP” Recommendations: 8.3.2.5.4.1.  Officers submitted to compete for aggregation “DP” recommendations compete among themselves.  The MLR president and only those senior raters with officers competing under aggregation will review and score the OCSRGps of these officers. 8.3.2.5.4.2.  If the total number of line IPZ officers aggregated to the MLR is still too small to earn a “DP” allocation, all panel members, not just those with officers competing for aggregation will score the records of the officers in the aggregated AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 241 group and may award one “DP” recommendation.  If awarded, this DP allocation will come from the carry over allocations.  EXAMPLE:  If there are 2 SRs with eligible  officers  and  each  SR  has  1  eligible  and  the  DP  allocation  rate  is  45%, then:  NOTE: The fraction in aggregation (0.90) is added to the remainder in carry-over (1.15) and rounded up from 2.05 (for LAF officers) to equal 3 “DPs.”  Since the ML didn’t have enough eligibles to earn a “DP” in aggregation, a “DP” is taken from the carry-over.  This results in 1 “DP” to award in aggregation and 2 “DPs” to award in carry-over. 8.3.2.5.4.3.  After all records are reviewed and scored and the MLR has awarded the  “DP”  recommendations,  SRs  or  their  designated  representatives  complete Section IX on the PRFs for their officers.  The MLR President verifies the results of the completed MLR by signing the order of merit.  SRs may make any changes to the PRF as a result of the MLR (i.e., if the last line states “my next DP” and the officer received a “DP” from the MLR then the SR should change the last line). 8.3.2.5.4.4.  The records of officers from the aggregated group that did not receive a “DP” recommendation may compete for carry-over “DP” recommendations at the discretion of the SR, within the limits prescribed by the ML. 8.3.2.5.5.  Procedures for Award of I/APZ Carry-over “DP” Recommendations: be for will submitted carry-over aggregation recommendations 8.3.2.5.5.1.  At the MLR’s discretion, and subject to the limit of DPs available in the carry-over phase, those officers who do not receive a “DP” recommendation from “DP” recommendations.    NOTE:    This  is  based  on  the  order  of  merit  from  the aggregation phase. 8.3.2.5.5.2.  Normally, the MLR president and all SRs with officers competing for carry-over decision  (EXCEPTION:  See paragraph 8.3.2.3.3 ).  At the discretion of the MLR President, other SRs available may also participate in carry-over decisions. 8.3.2.5.5.3.  SRs or their designated representatives complete Section IX on PRFs for  their  officers  by  marking  either  a  "DP"  or  a  "P"  as  appropriate.    The  MLR president verifies the results of the MLR by signing the order of merit.  SRs may make any changes to the PRF as a result of the MLR (i.e., if the last line states “my next DP” and the officer received a “DP” from the MLR then the SR should change the last line). participate carry-over in the 8.3.2.5.6.  Recorder  Responsibilities.  The  MLR  recorder  forwards  all  PRFs  and annotated  MELs updating AFPROMS.  NOTE:  No officer eligible for a particular board will be involved with the PRF process for that particular board. responsible personnel activity the for to 8.3.3.  Officers Assigned Outside the DoD and to Other Military Departments: 8.3.3.1.  LAF  officers  in  this  category  require  special  provisions  because  their organizations of assignment do not fall within the jurisdiction of a ML. 8.3.3.1.1.  Allocation Process.  For these officers, the Air Force District of Washington (AFDW)  acts  as  the  ML.    The  responsibilities  of  AFDW  are  the  same  as  those  in 242 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 paragraph  8.1.4.3  ,  except  for  aggregated  BPZ  officers.    The  HQ  USAF  MLR  (as described in paragraph 8.3.3.3 ) evaluates BPZ officers aggregated to the highest SR in the rating chain for whom the SR does not have the minimum group size required to receive an allocation. 8.3.3.1.2.  PRFs.  SR submitting officers to compete for aggregation or carry-over “DP” recommendations prepare and forward PRFs to AFDW, leaving Section IX blank. 8.3.3.2.  Non-LAF Officers:   HQ  AFPC  acts  as 8.3.3.2.1.  Allocation  Process. the  ML  for  promotion recommendations only.  When the primary SR does not have the minimum group size required to receive an allocation, the HQ USAF Non-line MLR at AFPC will review and evaluate the PRFs for these officers as a separate group.  SRs for non-line officers assigned outside DoD earn “DP” allocations as specified in paragraph 8.3.1.11. 8.3.3.2.2.  PRFs.  SRs who submit their officers to compete for aggregation or carry- over “DP” recommendations prepare PRFs, leaving Section IX blank.  SRs forward PRFs to HQ AFPC/DP2SPE NLT 35 days prior to CSB. 8.3.3.3.  HQ USAF Review: 8.3.3.3.1.  The AFDW Commander directs the HQ USAF MLR to convene 40 to 60 days  before  the  CSB  for  which  the  PRFs  are  prepared.    The  AF/CV,  or  officer designated by the AF/CC, serves as MLR president.  The AFDW Commander with the assistance of HQ USAF/A1, selects a minimum of four members, consistent with the minimum grade requirements for SRs, to serve as members. 8.3.3.3.2.  The HQ USAF MLR will review all completed I/APZ and BPZ PRFs and award aggregation and carry-over “DP” recommendations.  AFDW is responsible for providing SRs copies of completed PRFs on their ratees.  This MLR will also review all PRFs completed by sole SRs (see definition of sole senior rater in this instruction). 8.3.3.3.3.  The  recorder  consolidates  information  on  the  number  of  BPZ  officers assigned, the number of BPZ  “DP” recommendations available, and the number of “DP” recommendations awarded.  NOTE:  No officer eligible for a particular board will be involved with the PRF process for that particular board. 8.3.3.3.4.  If, during the review of completed PRFs, the board discovers that a senior rater awarded more “DP” recommendations than allowed, the MLR president discusses this with the SR. 8.3.3.3.4.1.  After  the  SR  decides  which  PRFs  to  correct,  they  forward  the  re-accomplished PRFs to the MLR by the most expeditious means. 8.3.3.3.4.2.  If  the  SR  does  not  specify  which  PRFs  need  correcting,  the  panel reviews the OCSRGps and DQHBs of all officers assigned to that SR to determine which  overall  recommendations  need  changing.  The  panel  then  prepares  a  new PRF, with Sections I through VIII copied verbatim from the original PRF submitted by the SR. 8.3.3.3.4.2.1.  The MLR President marks the "Promote" block in section IX of the re-accomplished PRFs and signs Section X. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 243  8.3.3.3.4.3.  The  MLR  holds  PRFs  they  re-accomplish  pending  receipt  of  a  re-accomplished  PRF  from  the  SR.  If  they  receive  the  SR’s  re-accomplished  PRF before MLR conclusion, the re-accomplished PRF is submitted to the MLR for review.    If  the  MLR  has  concluded,  the  PRF  is  re-accomplished  by  the  panel president,  submitted  to  AFDW  and  the  original  submitted  by  the  SR  will  be destroyed.  The ML will then process the PRF as appropriate. 8.3.3.3.5.  Award of “DP” recommendations to I/APZ officers is always separate and distinct from award of "DP" recommendations to BPZ officers. 8.3.3.3.6.  The MLR President completes PRFs with Section IX left blank. 8.3.3.3.7.  Since panel members may not be SRs for the officers meeting the MLR, members are encouraged to discuss an officer's OCSRGp and current performance with the SR in any case where the panel members believe it necessary. 8.3.4.  Joint MLRs: 8.3.4.1.  Evaluation Reviews.  The president of a panel held to evaluate Joint officers is always an Air Force GO. Joint MLs may exercise one of two options:  1) hold their own reviews, or 2) allow the HQ USAF MLR to evaluate their officers.  If the Joint ML is the sole SR, the HQ USAF MLR will review all completed Joint ML sole SR PRFs. 8.3.4.2.  PRF.  When SRs submit officers to compete at the HQ USAF MLR, Section IX of the PRF is left blank. 8.3.4.3.  If the ML chooses to hold a review but there is no Air Force GO assigned to the activity, the ML may obtain the assistance of an Air Force GO assigned to another activity.  If  necessary,  the  HQ  USAF/A1  will  assist  the  ML  in  obtaining  a  GO  to  serve  as  the president. 8.3.4.3.1.  SRs submit to the panel all I/APZ and BPZ completed PRFs as well as the PRFs (Section IX blank) on all I/APZ officers submitted to compete for aggregation or carry-over “DP” recommendations. 8.3.4.3.2.  The  responsibilities  and  procedures  of  Joint  Reviews  are  the  same  as  in paragraph  8.3.2,  except  for  the  requirement  for  all  BPZ  PRFs,  regardless  of recommendation, to be reviewed by an MLR (Joint MLR hosted by an Air Force GO or HQ USAF MLR).  This is to ensure our Air Force officers in a Joint environment are getting an Air Force look. 8.3.5.  Officers Assigned as Permanent Party Students. 8.3.5.1.  Management  Level  Students  -  officers  assigned  as  permanent  party  students training in their utilization field to include TDY in a training status.  In-utilization training includes any follow-on, specialized, requalification, upgrade, enhancement, or broadening training in the officer’s utilization field. MLs receive separate allocations based on those populations since permanent party eligibles and students must be evaluated as two distinct categories.  For both I/APZ and BPZ LAF permanent party students, allocations round up at  the  ML  and  down  at  the  SR  level.    For  I/APZ  non-line  permanent  party  students, allocations round down.  BPZ non-line permanent party student allocations round up at the 244 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 ML and down at the SR level. Evaluation procedures are the same as outlined in paragraph 8.3.2.5.    Responsibilities  of  the  ML  with  regard  to  students  are  the  same  as  those  in paragraph 8.3.2.4.1. 8.3.5.2.  AF Level Students - officers assigned as permanent party students training outside their utilization field.  Outside utilization training includes DE, degree-granting programs (usually AFIT sponsored), language training, Education With Industry (EWI)  programs, attaché/designate training, MC/DC residency programs (when a new AFSC or suffix is awarded  upon  completion  of  training  or  when  determined  by  the  competitive  category functional  representatives),  internships,  and  initial  qualification  training  into  a  new utilization field. 8.3.5.2.1.  HQ AFPC/DP2SPE acts as the ML for AF level students and receives “DP” allocations based on the number of BPZ or IPZ officers eligible for consideration by the HQ USAF Student MLR discussed in paragraph 8.3.5.2.  The allocation rate is applied to students, patients and MIAs/POWs separately and rounded up at the ML. 8.3.5.2.2.  HQ USAF Student ML Review.  Convened by USAF/A1, it considers both Line and Non-Line permanent party students, patients and MIAs/POWs.  It convenes approximately 70 days prior to the CSB.  HQ USAF/A1 designates an MLR president and  a  minimum  of  four  MLR  members  consistent  with  the  minimum  grade requirements for senior raters.  The MLR is responsible for the following: I/APZ 8.3.5.2.2.1.  Reviewing the OCSRGp, DQHB and N-O PRFs. 8.3.5.2.2.2.  Separately evaluating the records of those officers competing  for BPZ “DP”  recommendations  and those  officers  competing  for  I/APZ  “DP” recommendations. 8.3.5.2.2.3.  Scoring  all  BPZ  and records  and  awarding  “DP” recommendations based on the allocation rate prescribed for that grade and zone. 8.3.5.2.2.4.  Scoring records and awarding promotion recommendations to officers inpatient, MIA and POW status. 8.3.5.2.2.5.  Awarding  all  promotion  recommendations.    There  are  no  separate procedures to award aggregation and carry-over allocations. 8.3.5.2.2.6.  Ensuring  the  R-O  PRF  is  accomplished  for  each  officer,  the appropriate recommendation in Section IX is marked, the PRF is signed by the MLR  president,  and  is  attached  to  the  N-O  PRF  prepared  by  the  officer’s  last permanent party SR. 8.3.5.2.2.7.  Ensuring ratees receive a copy of the completed R-O and the attached N-O PRFs.  NOTE:  These are distributed per paragraph 8.1.4.2.13. 8.3.5.3.  Writing Letters to Air Force Student MLR. 8.3.5.3.1.  Air Force-level students eligible for promotion may write a letter to the Air Force Student MLR.  The submitter must: 8.3.5.3.1.1.  Submit  the  letter  in  good  faith  and  ensure  it  contains  accurate information to the best of your knowledge. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 245 8.3.5.3.1.2.  Sign and date the letter. 8.3.5.3.1.3.  Send the letter to HQ AFPC/DP2SPE so it arrives no later than the 5 days prior to the MLR convening date.  The MLR will not consider letters that arrive on or after the convening date.  Address letters to:  CY (insert appropriate year and grade) USAF Student MLR, HQ AFPC/DP2SPE.  Letters may be faxed, emailed or mailed but must have an actual signed signature (i.e., payroll signature). 8.3.5.3.1.4.  If  requesting  return  of  the  letter,  provide  a  stamped  self-addressed envelope. Otherwise, the letter will be destroyed upon conclusion of the Student MLR.  Letters will not be forwarded to the CSB. 8.3.5.3.2.  HQ  AFPC/DP2SPE  advises  officers  when  letters  do  not  meet  the  above requirements and either returns or destroys the letter. 8.3.5.3.3.  Letters  on  behalf  of  other  officers  are  not  permitted  (to  clarify:  eligible officers may provide letters as attachments to their letter; however, a stand-alone letter cannot be submitted on their behalf). 8.3.5.3.4.  The following attachments are not permitted: documents that can become a permanent  part  of  the  officer's  selection  folder  (i.e.,  PRFs  considered  by  previous CSBs, unsigned OPRs and TRs, decoration narratives or LOEs which become part of the permanent record). 8.3.6.  Non-line officers and LAF-J.  Non-line officers (HC, MC, DC, NC, BSC, MSC) and LAF-J  compete  for  promotion  by  competitive  category.    In  some  cases,  their  promotion opportunity is different from line officers.  Also, the total number of officers in each of these competitive categories is relatively small.  Consequently, the number of eligible officers under a SR will frequently be insufficient to receive a "DP" allocation, as is often the case even when officers aggregate to the ML. 8.3.6.1.  PRFs.  Section IX is blank on PRFs for officers submitted by the MLR to the USAF Non-Line MLR.  The USAF Non-Line MLR president completes Section IX with either a “DP” or, "P" recommendation.  Section VI (Group Size) for I/APZ non-line officers will always be “N/A”. 8.3.6.2.  Non-Line  Evaluation  Reviews.    An  MLR  and/or  the  HQ  USAF  MLR  may evaluate I/APZ and BPZ non-line officers. 8.3.6.3.  MLR.  SRs submit completed PRFs, and PRFs with Section IX left blank, on all officers  submitted  to  compete  for  aggregation  or  carry-over  recommendations.    This includes PRFs on permanent party ML students. 8.3.6.3.1.  For each competitive category, the MLR composition is:  The president (a line officer); SRs who awarded a “DP”; SRs with officers competing for aggregation or  carry-over  “DP”  recommendations;  an  officer  from  the  competitive  category concerned  who  meets  the  minimum  grade  requirement  to  be  a  SR  and  non-voting recorders.  If an officer from a competitive category in the Health Professions who meets the criteria is not available, the ML may designate an officer from one of the other Health Professions who meets the minimum grade requirements to serve on the panel.  For promotion to colonel, if a GO is not assigned to represent the competitive 246 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 category, the ML may designate a colonel from the competitive category to serve on the MLR. 8.3.6.3.2.  The  MLR  evaluates  the  records  of  officers  competing  for  BPZ  “DP” recommendations as a separate process. 8.3.6.3.3.  MLs for  aggregate  and  carry-over recommendations  at  the  Air  Force  MLR  for  non-line  officers  (subject  to  limits established by HQ AFPC/DP2SPE). identify  officers to  compete 8.3.6.4.  HQ USAF Non-Line MLR: 8.3.6.4.1.  This panel considers those officers aggregated from MLs and senior raters outside DoD and those recommended to compete for aggregate and carry-over “DP” recommendations. It also evaluates non-line officers assigned as permanent party Air Force-level students and non-line officers in patient, MIA and POW status.  HQ AFPC convenes these reviews at AFPC approximately 30 days before the CSB. 8.3.6.4.2.  Composition:  President (a line officer) and a minimum of four members as designated by the AF/A1, or designated representative, consistent with the minimum grade requirements, where possible.  The competitive category under consideration will not  form  the  majority  of  MLR  membership.    For  MLRs  considering  the  Health Professions (MSC, BSC, MC, DC, and NC), no more than two members may come from the competitive category under consideration.  The remaining two normally will be  from  a  medical  profession  competitive  category  not  under  consideration.    Line officers  may  serve  if  obtaining  panel  members  from  the  medical  professions  is impractical. 8.3.6.4.3.  HQ AFPC/DP2SPE limits the number of officers each ML may submit to compete  for  aggregate  and  carry-over  allocations  to  the  total  number  of  “DP” allocations available. Ensures a OCSRGp and PRF on each officer being submitted are available  for  review,  and  holds  an  Air  Force  Non-Line/LAF-J  MLR  for  each competitive category. 8.3.6.4.4.  MLR responsibilities are the same as discussed in paragraph 8.3.2.4. 8.4.  Special Provisions (applies to ADL officers only). 8.4.1.  Officers Relocating During the PRF Process.  To ensure officers with a PCA or PCS assignment to a new SR effective after the PRF accounting date, but on or before the PRF cutoff date, receive full consideration for a “DP” recommendation, special provisions apply.  The gaining SR considers all eligible officers (except patients) regardless of promotion zone, who have a DAS (in PDS) effective after the PRF accounting date, but on or before the PRF cutoff date, for a “DP” recommendation.  For similar rules on promotion-eligible colonels, see paragraph 8.6.2. 8.4.1.1.  The losing SR’s total number of eligibles always includes officers in this category when determining the losing SR’s share of “DP” allocations.  As a result, the losing SR is responsible for preparing PRFs and ensuring quality review is completed. 8.4.1.2.  Do not adjust the gaining SR’s number of “DP” allocations to include officers in this category.  Take any “DP” recommendations awarded by a gaining SR from available allocations already established by the gaining SR’s ML. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 247 8.4.1.3.  To  provide  these  officers  fair  consideration,  the  losing  and  gaining  SRs  may discuss the officer’s performance and their intentions (via phone, memo, etc.). 8.4.1.4.  The gaining SR: 8.4.1.4.1.  Must  consider  only  those  eligible  officers  who  will  be  given  an  outright “Promote” recommendation by their losing SR.  Gaining SRs have no option to award an outright “DP”, nor can they nominate newly assigned officers for aggregation or carry-over  consideration  when  the  losing  senior  rater  nominates  them  to  the aggregation or carry-over process at the officer’s losing ML review or to the AF Non-Line MLR regardless of the outcome from the ML review. 8.4.1.4.2.  Must  consider  all  newly  assigned  officers  who  received  a  “Promote” recommendation on their PRF from the HQ USAF Student MLR.  Eligibles considered by  the  HQ  USAF  Student  MLR  are  not  competed  in  aggregation  or  carryover; therefore,  the  gaining  senior  raters  may  award  an  outright  “DP”,  or  compete  the officer(s) in aggregation and/or carry-over. 8.4.1.4.3.  Will  accomplish  a  new  PRF  only  if  this  provision  is  authorized  IAW paragraph 8.4.1.4.1.  The new accomplished PRF will contain the gaining SRID in Section VIII of the PRF and complete ratee identification data, unit mission description, and job description as of the DAS (PCS) or duty effective date (PCA) to the gaining senior rater.  NOTE:  If the gaining SR is unable to obtain a “DP” recommendation, either outright or by aggregation/carryover, then the accomplished PRF is destroyed and the original PRF accomplished by the losing SR will be used for the CSB. 8.4.1.5. The gaining SR will exercise the following options, as appropriate: 8.4.1.5.1.  Decide to take no action to submit an individual for a “DP” recommendation. 8.4.1.5.2.  Award a “DP” recommendation from earned allocations. 8.4.1.5.3.  Submit I/APZ officers to compete for aggregation and carry-over. 8.4.1.5.4.  Submit BPZ officers for aggregation and/or carry-over as appropriate for the officer's competitive category. 8.4.1.5.5.  Award  a  “DNP” recommendation  when  substantiated  derogatory information has been received since departure from previous assignment if time does not allow for not-qualified-for-promotion action processing.  This is considered a Stop File  (see  paragraph  8.5.)  and  must  be  submitted  in  writing  through  the  ML  to  HQ AFPC/DP2SPE.  Gaining SRs must get the concurrence of the gaining MLR President and  ensure  the  losing  SR  is  informed  of  the  “DNP”  action.    This  will  allow  the opportunity  for  possible  redistribution  of  any  previously  awarded  “DPs”  to  other deserving officers prior to the CSB. 8.4.1.6.  If  the  gaining  SR  submits  an  officer  for  aggregation  or  carry-over  “DP" recommendation,  the  gaining  SR  must  ensure  the  officer's  record  of  performance  is available. 8.4.1.7.  The gaining SR should notify the losing SR of his or her intentions. 8.4.1.8.  The ML will: 248 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 8.4.1.8.1.  Ensure  consideration  of  all  officers  in  this  category  for  promotion recommendation and manage all necessary actions to ensure full consideration by the losing and gaining SRs. 8.4.1.8.2.  Work  with  MPSs  to  notify  SRs  of  their  eligible  officers  who  fall  in  this category to ensure consideration for a “DP” recommendation, as outlined in paragraph 8.4. 8.4.1.8.3.  Notify HQ AFPC/DP2SPE when a gaining SR awards a “DP” or “DNP” recommendation.  This includes those awarded within a ML as a result of a PCA action. This is considered a Stop File under paragraph 8.4 (commonly known Old Guy/New Guy) circumstances and must be in writing IAW paragraph 8.5. 8.4.1.8.4.  Ensure allocations are not adjusted to account for officers in this category. 8.4.1.9.  The MPS will: 8.4.1.9.1.  Screen  all  officers  gained  after  the  PRF  accounting  date  to  determine eligibility  and  notify  SRs  accordingly.    Ensure  SRs  certify  a  review  of  all  gained eligibles by signing the old guy/new RIP or projected eligibles MEL which is generated from AFPROMS. 8.4.1.9.2.  Notify the ML of newly assigned officers whose SRID is not correct as soon as  possible;  monitor  DAS  for  changes  (resulting  from  finance  office  updates)  that would necessitate a correction to the SRID. 8.4.1.9.3.  Provide the senior rater a OCSRGp and DQHB on newly assigned members. 8.4.1.10.  HQ AFPC/DP2SPE will: 8.4.1.10.1.  Update all “DP” and “DNP” recommendations awarded by gaining SRs and updates inter-command SRID changes upon Stop File requests from MLs. 8.4.1.10.2.  Receive “DP” PRFs accomplished by the gaining senior rater thru the Stop File  process.    If  the  losing  and  gaining  senior  rater  both  award  the  same  overall recommendation, the PRF from the gaining senior rater is destroyed. 8.4.2.  Officers Added to or Deleted from Promotion Eligibility.  This paragraph applies to officers  who  become  eligible  or  ineligible  for  promotion  consideration  in  a  particular competitive category on or after the PRF allocation date.  Causes for a change in eligibility status  may  include:  SSB  or  AFBCMR  actions,  administrative  errors,  changes  in  dates  of separation (DOS), or similar circumstances. 8.4.2.1.  When an officer is added to a CSB or changes promotion zone eligibility, the SR: 8.4.2.1.1.  Prepares  a  PRF  without  a  restriction  as  to  the  type  of  recommendation awarded, since there are no adjustments made to allocations of “DP” recommendations on or after the PRF allocation date. 8.4.2.1.2.  Only  awards  “DP”  recommendations  to  officers  whose  OCSRGp  and DQHB are comparable to other officers who received “DP” recommendations during the normal PRF process. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 249 8.4.2.1.3.  Completes PRFs according to Table 8.1 (except section VI, Group Size).  In this section, enter a "1" for IPZ or BPZ officers and a "0" for APZ officers.  NOTE:  Group size for Non-Line is always “N/A” 8.4.2.1.4.  Either recommends or does not recommend the officer for promotion, if the promotion  opportunity  is  100%.    A  PRF  is  required  only  for  officers  who  are  not recommended for promotion. 8.4.2.2.  SRs  void  PRFs  completed  on  officers  subsequently  deleted  from  promotion eligibility following the PRF allocation date.  When a PRF is voided and an outright “DP” was awarded, SRs may reallocate these “DPs” to other officers and re-accomplish PRFs.  See paragraph 8.3.1.8.2. for disposition of “DPs” after the MLR convenes.  The appropriate MLR must approve changes to I/APZ, Joint BPZ and Non-line BPZ PRFs. Line BPZ PRFs changes do not require MLR approval. 8.4.2.3.  When an officer's zone of eligibility for promotion changes (i.e., from BPZ to IPZ), the above provisions apply.  SRs prepare a new PRF as appropriate to reflect the officer's correct promotion zone and void the old PRF. 8.4.3.  Prisoners, Deserters, and Officers on Appellate Leave.  Do not accomplish PRFs for officers who become prisoners or deserters, or who are on appellate leave on or before the PRF accounting date.  Notify HQ AFPC/DP2SPE through the ML to have these officers removed from the SR MEL unless the status is after the PRF accounting date.  HQ AFPC/DP2SPE prepares a board-specific AF Form 77 for ADL officers who fall into this category and places it  into  their  selection  record.    However,  officers  identified  as  prisoners,  deserters,  or  on appellate leave after the PRF accounting date will require PRFs from the losing SR.  His or her total number of eligibles will include these officers when determining “DP” allocations. 8.4.4.  Officers Eligible for Promotion when the Promotion Opportunity is 100%.  When the promotion opportunity for any grade at the CSB is 100%, SRs will prepare PRFs only on officers who receive “DNP” recommendation and on officers who receive a “P” but have derogatory information (e.g. Article 15, courts-martial, referral evaluation, LOR, etc.) filed in their OSRs.  Exceptions to this rule can be addressed to HQ AFPC/DP2SPE.  SRs will annotate the MEL with either a “P” (for "promote") or “N” (for “do not promote this board”) and forward the SRs MEL and “DNP” PRFs to the ML. MLs will review all “DNP” promotion recommendations at the MLR, update AFPROMS to show either “P” (recommended for promotion) or “N” (not recommended for promotion), and forward any completed PRFs and the MLs master MEL, signed by the MLR President, to arrive at HQ AFPC/DP2SPE no later than 30 days prior to the CSB start date.  MLs may use a representative sample of senior raters to evaluate these “DNP” recommendations. 8.4.5.  Officers assigned to units Above the Management Level (AML).  Officers assigned directly to the Offices of the CSAF, SecAF CJCS, SECDEF, VPOTUS, or POTUS, with that individual  as  their  direct  reporting  official,  are  “above  the  management  level.”    As  such, officers in this category require special provisions because these offices do not fall within the usual jurisdiction of an ML.  These select units generally have few promotion eligible officers for most boards. 8.4.5.1.  Allocation Process.  To ensure these officers receive full and fair consideration, the individual AML unit acts as the ML and receives separate DP allocations for IPZ and 250 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 BPZ  officers  assigned.    Since  there  is  no  opportunity  for  this  small  pocket  of  quality officers to aggregate up or compete for carry-over, the AML heads are authorized to award additional DPs. 8.4.5.2.  PRFs.  The AML heads are sole SRs and must prepare PRFs on all promotion eligible  officers  under  consideration  by  the  appropriate  CSB.    They  award  all  PRF recommendations. 8.4.5.3.  MLR.  Since the AML heads are sole SRs, they do not conduct MLRs; the PRFs are forwarded to the HQ USAF MLR (AFDW) for a quality review only. 8.5.  Correction  of  Promotion  Recommendation  Forms  (PRF)  (ADL  Officers)  (Stop  File process).  A PRF is considered a working copy until the start of the CSB.  If the PRF is not a matter of record, SRs have the flexibility to change PRFs.  NOTE:  All changes to PRFs should be completed no later than 2 weeks prior to the CSB.  However, in extreme circumstances and on a case-by-case basis, AFPC/DP2SPE may approve changes up to one duty day prior to the CSB.  The request must be from an O-6/equivalent or above, who has oversight of the MLR process and justification as to why the correction was not discovered within the time limit. 8.5.1.  For  typographical  errors,  concurrence  by  the  MLR  President  is  not  required.    For content changes, MLR president concurrence is necessary.  The following steps should be followed: 8.5.1.1.  SR contacts the ML to discuss the issue.  The ML will notify HQ AFPC/DP2SPE to  place  an  immediate  “Stop  File”  on  the  affected  officer’s  PRF(s)  with  written communication,  identifying  the  change,  (fax,  email,  letter)  within  24  hours  of  initial notification. 8.5.1.2.  The  SR  must  notify  the  affected  officer  (in  writing  or,  if  verbal,  follow-up  in writing) of the intent to change the PRF. 8.5.1.3.  SR forwards the corrected PRF to the ML and provides a copy to the officer. 8.5.1.4.  ML forwards the corrected PRF to HQ AFPC/DP2SPE. 8.5.2.  If the change to the PRF serves to weaken the narrative portion, is a negative content change, or a downgrade in the overall rating, the MLR process that the original PRF met must be re-accomplished.  In addition to the steps above, the officer must be provided a copy of the re-accomplished PRF and a letter, similar to the letter provided to an officer who receives a “DNP” recommendation, stating the officer’s right to write a letter to the CSB. 8.5.3.  Correction  of  PRFs  (ResAF  Officers)  (Stop  File  process).    A  PRF  is  considered  a working copy until the start of the CSB. If the PRF is not a matter of record, SRs have the flexibility to change PRFs.  NOTE:  All changes to PRFs should be completed NLT two weeks prior to the CSB.  However, in extreme circumstances and on a case-by-case basis, ARPC/PB may approve changes up to one duty day prior to the CSB.  The request must be from the SR (in  writing  or,  if  verbal,  follow-up  in  writing/electronic  mail  within  24  hours  of  initial notification). 8.5.3.1.  The  SR  must  notify  the  affected  officer  (in  writing  or,  if  verbal,  follow-up  in writing) of the intent to change the PRF. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 251 8.5.3.2.  If the change to the PRF serves to weaken the narrative portion, is a negative content change, or a downgrade in the overall rating, the PRF must be re-accomplished.  In addition to the steps above, the officer must be provided a copy of the re-accomplished PRF  and  a  letter,  similar  to  the  letter  provided  to  an  officer  who  receives  a  “DNP” recommendation, stating the officer’s right to write a letter to the CSB. 8.6.  Promotion  Recommendations  for  Colonels.  This  section  describes  how  to  recommend colonels  for  promotion  to  the  grade  of  brigadier  general.    It  applies  to  officers  eligible  for consideration by the HQ USAF or AFR GO CSB or an ANGUS Federal Recognition Board (FRB). 8.6.1.  Responsibilities in the Promotion Recommendation Process. 8.6.1.1.  Heads of MLs must: 8.6.1.1.1.  Prepare PRFs on all promotion-eligible colonels under consideration by the appropriate selection or federal recognition board (e.g., colonels with two years’ time in grade as of the board convening date).  NOTE:  Do not prepare PRFs on prisoners or officers on appellate leave.  When preparing PRFs on promotion-eligible colonels, MLs may consider, in addition to the OCSRGp, other reliable sources of information, to include the Senior Officer Unfavorable Information File (SOUIF) (if applicable).  Table  8.1.,  Notes  4  and  6,  contain  further  guidance.    Instructions  in  this  AFI  take precedence over those printed on the AF Form 709.  For ANGUS colonels, the AF Form 709 must be signed by the adjutant general.  For adjutants general, the AF Form 709 must be signed by the Governor. 8.6.1.1.2.  Personally complete, must be handwritten, PRFs by competitive category on all promotion-eligible colonels who receive a "DP" recommendation.  Complete PRFs no earlier than 60 calendar days and no later than 30 calendar days before the selection or federal recognition board convenes.  For ANG, PRFs must be typed. 8.6.1.1.3.  Designate one or more representatives to perform this function for all other promotion  recommendations.    Representatives  must  be  senior  in  grade  to  the ratees.  NOTE:  brigadier general selectees may not be designated as a representative for PRF purposes. 8.6.1.1.4.  Rank order all colonels who receive a “DP” recommendation. Rank order the  colonels  of  each  competitive  category  separately  (AFR  does  not  rank  order  by competitive category).  Include the ranking on the PRF in Section VI, “Group Size.”  Rankings must be sequential with no duplication within an ML.  This paragraph does not apply to ANGUS officers. 8.6.1.1.5  For ANGUS FRBs, Sections V-VIII must be typed “N/A” in each section.  Section IX must be marked “Definitely Promote”. 8.6.1.1.6.  Send completed PRFs on all AFR colonels to HQ USAF/REPS no later than 30 calendar days prior to the CSB convening date. 8.6.1.1.7.  Provide each ratee a copy of his or her PRF approximately 30 calendar days prior to the appropriate board.  Attach a memo (Figure 8.1) for ratees who received a “DNP” to advise him or her of the right to submit a letter to the CSB. 252 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 8.6.1.2.  Vice Chief of Staff, USAF (AF/CV).  The AF/CV, or designated representative, serves as the single ML for Air Force colonels assigned outside the DoD, to other military services, or as Air Force-level (e.g. senior service school) students. 8.6.1.3.  Air Force Colonel Management Office (AF/DPO).  Manages the PRF process for all ADL colonels.  It announces the PRF accounting date and matches promotion eligible officers to the appropriate ML on that date. 8.6.1.4.  General Officer Management (AF/REG).  Manages the PRF process for all AFR colonels. 8.6.1.5.  National Guard Bureau ANG General Officer Management Office (NGB-GO).  Manages the PRF process for all ANGUS colonels. 8.6.2.  Officers Relocating During the PRF Process.  Colonels reassigned to a new ML within 60 days (before or after) the PRF accounting date may have their PRF written by either the gaining or losing ML at the discretion of the two MLs.  If there is a conflict, the officer's ML of administrative assignment (as of the PRF accounting date) prepares the PRF.  NOTE:  For promotion-eligible colonels, the head of the ML is the person serving in that capacity as of the date  PRFs  are  due  to  AF/DPO.    For  ANGUS  colonels,  their  PRF  must  be  written  by  the Adjutant General of their state affiliation. 8.6.3.  Processing and Use of the PRF for colonels. 8.6.3.1.  Send completed PRFs on all ADL colonels to AF/DPO no later than 30 calendar days prior to the CSB convening date. 8.6.3.2.  Send completed PRFs on all AFR Colonels to HQ USAF/REPS approximately 30 calendar days prior to the CSB convening date. 8.6.3.3.  Send  completed  PRFs  on  all  ANGUS  colonels  to  NGB-GO  no  later  than  30 calendar  days  prior  to  the  ANGUS  Federal  Recognition  Board  convening  date,  or  as directed by NGB-GO. 8.6.3.4.  N-O/R-O PRFs for permanent-party students, patients and MIAs/POWs. 8.6.3.4.1.  The SR sends the narrative-only PRF to AF/DPO no later than 30 days prior to the officer departing PCA or PCS for school. 8.6.3.4.2.  The  SR  sends  evaluations  for  officers  in  patient  or  MIA/POW  status  to AF/DPO no later than 60 days after the officer enters this new status. 8.6.3.4.3.  SRs  provide  a  copy  of  the  N-O  PRF  to  the  ratee  prior  to  the  officer’s departure from home station. 8.6.3.4.4.  AF/DPO maintains N-O PRFs until the officer leaves student, patient, or MIA/POW status. AF/DPO destroys N-O PRFs when the officer no longer competes for  promotion  in  this  status.  AF/DPO  maintains  the  N-O  PRFs  until  distributed  as specified below: 8.6.3.4.4.1.  For  officers  who  become  eligible  for  promotion  consideration  by  a brigadier general CSB before they change status, AF/DPO forwards the narrative-only PRFs to 11 WG/DPJ. 8.6.3.4.4.2.  After completion of the AF/CV recommendation-only PRFs (which AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 253 are attached to the N-O PRFs), the AF/CV forwards the PRFs back to Air Force Colonel Management Office for inclusion in the HQ USAF selection folder and provides copies to the ratees. 8.6.3.5.  Restrict the use of the AF Form 709 to the brigadier general CSBs or ANG FRB.  Do not use PRFs for any other personnel action. 8.6.3.6.  A PRF becomes a “matter of record” upon the convening date of the CSB or ANG FRB for which it was prepared. 8.6.3.7.  Destroy a colonel’s PRF within 30 days of the officer’s promotion, retirement, or separation. 8.6.3.8.  Only the offices listed below may maintain copies of the PRF. 8.6.3.8.1.  AF/DPO for all ADL colonels. 8.6.3.8.2.  HQ USAF/REPS for all AFR colonels. 8.6.3.8.3.  NGB-GO for all ANGUS colonels. 8.6.4.  Instructions for Completing the AF Form 709 for colonels. See Table 8.1. 8.7.  Supplemental  Management  Level  Reviews  (SMLRs)  for  Recommendation  Upgrade (POST-CSB),  (For  ADL  Only).  The  SMLR  is  a  “competitive  process”  required  to  ensure fairness and equity in the “post-CSB” PRF appeal process.  As stated in paragraph 8.1.4.3.10., MLs must maintain copies of OCSRs awarded to the bottom DP and the top two Ps in carry-over at their MLR for each competitive category as it appeared before the MLR.  The OCSR will serve as the “DP benchmark” record to be competed via SMLR against OCSRs of officers seeking a “post-CSB” PRF upgrade of the overall recommendation (Section IX) to a “definitely promote” (DP) rating. 8.7.1.  Granting SMLR Consideration. MLs will grant SMLR consideration only if they have the written support of both the original SR and MLR President in accordance with Attachment 2, paragraph A2.6. 8.7.2.  SMLR Procedures.  MLs will conduct SMLRs in conjunction with their next scheduled MLR, when appropriate membership is present.  When conducting a SMLR, the applicant’s OCSR, to include the revised PRF as supported by both the original SR and MLR president, will  be  competed  head-to-head  against  the  “DP”  and  “P”  benchmarks  and  scored  by  all members of the MLR. MLs must ensure the applicant’s OCSR contains only those documents that would have been present during the original MLR.  Scoring of the records will be a simple vote.  The applicant’s OSR must tie or beat the bottom “DP” benchmark in order to be awarded a DP rating. 8.7.3.  Disclosing of SMLR Results.  At the conclusion of the SMLR, the ML must ensure the MLR President certifies the results via a results letter.  If the applicant earned a “DP” rating from  the  SMLR,  the  letter,  along  with  the  PRF,  should  be  returned  to  the  applicant  to  be included (Evaluation  Report  Appeals  Board  process IAW chapter 10), see paragraph 8.4.4.1.2.  In addition, a copy of the letter and PRF must be forwarded to HQ AFPC/DP2SPE.  If the applicant is not granted a “DP” from the SMLR, his/her appeal to change the overall recommendation of the PRF to a “DP” is without merit.  in  his/her  appeal  package 254 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 As such, the results letter and PRF should be returned to the applicant, and only a copy of the letter must be forwarded to HQ AFPC/DP2SPE.   AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 255                     (date) Figure  8.1.

For ANGUS colonels nominated for brigadier general, enter “Definitely Promote”. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 259 18  X SR Data See instructions at Note 8 for lieutenant colonels and below, Note 9 for ADL colonels and Note 11 for ANGUS colonels nominated for brigadier general. 260 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 Notes: 1.  SRs complete PRFs no earlier than 60 days before the CSB (the PRF cutoff date). For AFR, complete the PRFs in time to arrive at HQ ARPC not later than 45 days before the board convening date.  SRs award one of three overall recommendations: "Definitely Promote," "Promote," or "Do Not Promote This Board."  Excluding AFR and AGR officers, there is a limit on "DP" recommendations to ensure they convey the intended message. Except for PRFs written on promotion-eligible colonels (see also Note 6), there is a limit on "DP" recommendations to ensure they convey the intended message.  There is no limit on "P" and "DNP" recommendations. 2.  If changes to DAFSC or duty title are approved after the MLR, but before the CSB, see paragraph 8.5. for correction procedures.  Once the PRF is a matter of record, a formal application for correction must be submitted in accordance with Chapter 10 of this instruction. For RASL officers, contact HQ ARPC/DPS if data is incorrect.  For AGR students, enter “Student of (type of school),” (i.e. PDE, IDE, SDE, etc). 3.  For R-O PRFs. a.  Enter in Item 4, student DAFSC; for Item 5, the organizational designation, MAJCOM, and location of the ratee's assigned school; and for Item 6, student PAS code. b.  For AGR students only.  Enter in Item 4, student DAFSC; for Item 5, Office of Air Force Reserve (HAF), Washington DC; and for Item 6, student PAS code. 4.  Some general guidelines: a.  Comments must be in bullet format. b.  May include recommendations for promotion, DE, and next assignment (limit comments to the next higher grade). c.  In applying the whole-person concept, evaluators may consider grade-appropriate DE when preparing PRFs, however; DE should not be a pass/fail item.  Evaluators are prohibited from commenting on candidacy, selection, completion of, or enrollment of DE.  NOTE:  Comments are authorized only on those officers which will be departing for DE and may only be on the PRF completed just prior to departure.  This may be a regular PRF or a Narrative-Only PRF.  d.  SRs may consider and/or include information from other reliable sources (i.e. UIF, LOE, ROTC DGs, OTS DGs, etc).  For promotion-eligible colonels and brigadier generals; SRs may consider information in an officer’s SOUIF.   Most comments on a PRF are factual (i.e., CGO of the Quarter) and does not need to be quoted or attributed.  However, when using stratification (because this is individual/previous evaluator specific) on the PRF and when that stratification statement is from someone other than the individual signing the PRF then it needs to be quoted or attributed (i.e., "#1 of 50" or #1 of 50 - 2 WG/CC).  (The intent is to put the stratification which an officer receives in their career in its proper content). e.  Do not comment on ratings or recommendations on prior AF Forms 709.  However, a previous BPZ selection may be mentioned. f.  Comments may be warranted if an officer displays a reluctance to accept responsibility, a negative attitude toward the job, or a decrease in performance-based potential.  However, if an officer has a date of separation, has an approved retirement date, or is unsure about career intent, it does not necessarily detract from performance-based potential and should not be commented on in the PRF. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 261 g.  Do not discuss classified information. h.  Do consider including comments related to Article 15 action, or letters of reprimand, admonishment or counseling.  It is strongly recommended that Control Roster action be recorded.  It is mandatory to record courts-martial results unless actions resulted in acquittal. i.  Do not make recommendations for selective continuation since Selective Continuation Boards do not see PRFs.  On CSBs where promotion and selective continuation are involved, PRFs are removed from the selection records before the start of the selective continuation process. j.  Refer to paragraph 1.12.  for guidance on inappropriate evaluator considerations and comments on PRFs. k.  Duty information must be within the SR’s jurisdiction as of the PRF accounting date. 1.  May not comment on an officer’s prior enlisted time. 5.  Comments are mandatory when an officer receives a "DP" or "DNP" recommendation, and must substantiate, amplify, or explain the recommendation.  Comments for “P” recommendations are optional for BPZ ADL officers. 6.  On PRFs prepared on promotion-eligible colonels, entries in Section VI may be handwritten (in dark blue or black ink) but on all “DP” PRF entries must be “Handwritten” (must be typed for ANG FRB).  Rank officers by competitive category.  Focus on potential to serve at the GO level.  Use ratee’s accomplishments as a colonel to demonstrate potential and to explain why an officer uniquely qualifies for promotion more so than others.  Use comparative terms and gauge difficulty of job challenge, but do not repeat content of OPRs (unlike PRFs for FGOs and CGOs).  Highlight factors that demonstrate desired GO traits (breadth, depth, versatility, adaptability, generalist qualities, leadership, management intellect, presence, image, communication skills, experience, functional expertise, appreciation for future vision, etc.).  Use personal terms and be clear and concise.  Identify true contenders and place heavy emphasis on future use as a GO.  The head of the ML (or designated representative) may solicit advice and information from the ratee's supervisors and commanders, both current and past.  If rendering a "DP" recommendation, indicate the officer's rank order among the total number of promotion-eligible officers in the ML and competitive category.  EXAMPLE:  An officer receiving a "DP" recommendation who is second in an ML of 150 total eligibles would have the entry "2/150" in Section VI.  If the officer does not receive a "DP" recommendation, leave this section blank or enter “N/A.” MLs are not limited in the number of "DP" recommendations they award to their eligibles. 7.  For N-O PRFs, do not mark any of the three blocks and type/select from the drop down menu "No Overall Recommendation" in the top of this section.  For Non-Line of the AF officers:  MC and DC promotion to major and lieutenant colonel.  Do not prepare a PRF for Judge Advocate (LAF-J) promotion to captain.  For officers submitted in aggregate or carry-over to an evaluation board, leave this section blank. 262 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 8.  SR (lieutenant colonels and below): a.  Enter name, grade, branch of service (military officers and DAF civilians only), organization, command of assignment, and location.  Grade must be that in which the SR is serving, EXCEPTION:  Enter “Brig Gen (S)” for brigadier general selectees confirmed by the U.S. Senate and designated as SR by the ML.  Enter “Major Gen (S)” for major general selectees confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  Retired grade is not authorized.  If an officer has been "frocked," enter his or her actual grade unless the officer is serving in a funded billet and the ratee is a lieutenant colonel or above. b.  Enter only the last four digits of the SSN if the evaluator is a USAF officer (suffix not entered). The SSN is optional, though encouraged, if the evaluator is a civilian or a member of another U.S. military service. c.  Do not include command level, unless it is an integral part of the duty title, with the official duty title. d.  Do not enter any classified information. e.  For ADL officers, enter current data as of the date of PRF completion.  Do not complete the PRF before the PRF cut-off date. f.  For ADL R-O PRFs, the President of the Air Force MLR acts as the SR.  Enter the following information:  name; grade; branch of service; for organization, enter "HQ USAF Student MLR;" for location, enter the location of the review; SSN; and for duty title, enter "President, HQ USAF Student MLR." 9.  For ADL colonels, the head of the ML must complete this section if the recommendation is a "DP."  For other recommendations, the head of the ML may designate one or more representatives, senior in grade to the ratees, to complete this section. 10.  For PV nomination, place the position number to the far right in this block. All PV nominations must have a valid funded position number with an authorized grade higher than the officer’s current grade when it arrives at HQ ARPC/PB.  PRFs with missing/invalid position numbers or those for nominees not the incumbent (an UMD overage) in the position for which nominated, may be returned.  Questions should be directed to HQ ARPC/PB. 11.  For ANGUS colonels, their PRF must be signed by the Adjutant General of their state affiliation.    AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 263 Table 8.2.

Notes: 1.  For Line of the Air Force (LAF) officers only, the following rules apply:  APZ eligibles do not generate "DP" allocations; therefore, they do not apply when determining the entry for Section VI on the PRF.  If there are only APZ eligibles in an ML, a single "DP" allocation is still available.  In this case, the most deserving APZ officer, with a record of such quality to warrant a “DP,” may be awarded a "DP" recommendation, and all APZ officers in the ML receive a "0" in section VI on the PRF.  When an officer is added to a CSB to change promotion zone eligibility after Day 66, enter a “1 for IPZ or BPZ officers or a “0” for APZ officers.  Group size for BPZ eligibles are calculated in the same manner as IPZ. 2.  For Non-Line officers (I/APZ and BPZ), always enter “N/A” regardless of the number of eligibles unless they fall under the criteria of paragraph 8.4.2.

If the result is not a whole number, round down to the next lower whole number. EXAMPLE:  A SR who has 63 eligibles applied to a 65% allocation rate earns 40 “DP” allocations (63 X 65% = 40.95 allocations, rounded down to 40).  This table applies to all competitive categories.  EXCEPTION:  When the SR has three IPZ officers and the allocation rate is 65%, SRs may award two “DP” allocations even though the computation does not result in two allocations (1.95).  This Table reflects this exception.   266 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 Chapter 9 AF FORM 3538, RETENTION RECOMMENDATION FORM 9.1.  When to Use the AF Form 3538, Retention Recommendation Form (RRF).  Use the AF Form 3538 to provide performance-based differentiation and retention recommendations to assist involuntary  separation/retirement  CSBs  (such  as  Force  Shaping,  Reduction  in  Force  [RIF],  or Selective Early Retirement Boards [SERB]). 9.2.  Responsibilities. 9.2.1.  First Evaluator: 9.2.1.1.  Reviews the ratee's OCSRGp, DQHB, and UIF before preparing the RRF. May consider  other  reliable  information  about  duty  performance  and  conduct  except  as prohibited by paragraph 1.12. or other regulatory guidance. 9.2.1.2.  Must be knowledgeable of the ratee's most recent performance.  The first evaluator may request subordinate supervisors provide information on an officer's most recent duty performance and may ask for suggestions based upon the officer's duty performance for PRF recommendations. 9.2.1.3.  Is responsible for evaluating each officer's OCSRGp and DQHB and awarding one of two retention recommendations for eligible officers: 9.2.1.3.1.  A  “Definitely  Retain”  recommendation  means  the  strength  of  the  ratee’s performance and performance based potential alone warrants retention. 9.2.1.3.2.  A “Retain” recommendation means the strength of the ratee’s performance warrants retention. 9.2.1.3.3.  A  “Do  Not  Retain”  recommendation  means  the  ratee  does  not  warrant retention and should not be retained by the board for which the officer is eligible.  The first evaluator must make comments explaining to the board why the officer should not be retained. 9.2.1.3.4.  Evaluators may not base their retention recommendations on a member’s intention  to  separate  or  retire  or  a  board’s  retention  or  separation  quota.  Recommendations must be based on the member’s record of performance and his/her potential for further service. 9.2.1.3.5.  Comments  are  mandatory.    Refer  to  paragraph  1.12.    for  inappropriate comments.  In addition, promotion recommendations are not permitted in the RRF. 9.2.1.3.6.  For Colonel RRFs only:  Comments may be handwritten.  Comments should only relate to the officer’s record as a colonel. 9.2.2.  Second Evaluator: 9.2.2.1.  Endorses the RRF no earlier than 60 days before the CSB (the RRF cutoff date). 9.2.2.2.  Ensures no subordinate commander/supervisor asks, or allows, an officer to draft or prepare his or her own RRF. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 267 9.2.2.3.  Ensures there are no boards or panels of officers convened to collectively score, rate,  rank,  or  tally  the  records  and/or  generate  a  priority  list  of  eligible  officers  unless specifically authorized by this instruction.  However, senior raters may request subordinate supervisors to provide their assessment of the rank order of officers within their direct chain of command. 9.2.2.4.  Comments only if he/she non-concurs with the first evaluator’s recommendation.  If  the  second  evaluator  non-concurs  with  the  first  evaluator’s  recommendation,  then comments  are  mandatory  explaining  his/her  decision.    NOTE:    AFPC  may    provide alternate guidance when appropriate. 9.2.2.5.  Provides the ratee a copy of the RRF (hand-delivered or sent in a sealed envelope clearly marked, “To Be Opened By Addressee Only”) approximately 30-45 days prior to the board (see note).  The reason for this is two-fold:  1) to advise the ratee of the retention recommendation and 2) to provide the ratee an opportunity to point out any errors of fact so they may be corrected prior to the CSB.  NOTE:  If the ratee is geographically separated, send it to the ratee by “return receipt requested” mail. 9.2.2.6.  Ensures the RRF remains a private matter with access being only between the evaluators, the ratee and the board.  Subordinate evaluators or others may have access to a RRF’s comments or recommendation only if permitted by the ratee. 9.2.2.7.  Attaches a memo telling the ratee who receives an RRF with a ‘Separate/Retire’ recommendation that he or she has the right to submit a letter to the board.  See Figure 9.1. 9.2.3.  The Ratee: 9.2.3.1.  It is the ratee’s responsibility to contact the second evaluator if he/she has not received a copy of the RRF NLT 15 days prior to the board. 9.2.3.2.  It is the ratee’s responsibility to ensure his/her record is current and accurate. 9.3.  RRF  Submission.  Administrative  processing  for  the  RRF,  to  include  SRID  accounting, AFPROMS management, etc, unless stated otherwise, will mirror that of the PRF except for those actions directly associated with the MLR process.  There is no MLR process for the RRF. Refer to paragraph 8.1.5., for processing procedures and responsibilities. 9.4.  Air Force Advisor Examination.  When applicable, type, “AF Advisor Review” on the left margin of the RRF and include the AF advisor’s name, grade, “USAF,” date, and signature. See paragraph 1.6.8. for more guidance. 9.5.  Correction of Retention Recommendation Form (RRF).  A RRF is considered a working copy until the start of the board.  If the RRF is not a matter of record, second evaluators have the flexibility to change RRFs no later than 2 weeks prior to the CSB.  Use the “Stop File” process (see paragraph 8.5.) when correcting RRFs. 9.5.1.  If the change to the RRF serves to weaken the narrative portion, is a negative content change, or is a downgrade in the recommendation, the officer must be provided a copy of the re-accomplished RRF and a letter, similar to the letter provided to an officer who receives a “Separate” recommendation, stating the officer’s right to write a letter to the CSB. 9.5.2.  A RRF becomes a “matter of record” upon the convening date of the CSB for which it was prepared. 268 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016                     (date) Figure 9.1.

The  Evaluation  Reports  Appeal  Board  (ERAB)  was  established  to  provide  all  Air Force personnel with an avenue of relief for correcting errors or injustices in evaluations at the lowest possible level. 10.1.2.  If an evaluation cannot be corrected under Table 10.2. an applicant’s first avenue of relief for correcting an evaluation is through the ERAB, which is accessible via the vMPF/vPC, (see the PSD Guide for further guidance). 10.1.3.  An  applicant’s  second  and  last  avenue  of  relief  is  via  the  Air  Force  Board  for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR) by submitting a DD Form 149, Application for Correction of Military Records under the Provisions of Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 1552, IAW AFI 36-2603 and AFPAM 36-2607, Applicant’s Guide to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR).  NOTE:  Applicant should exhaust all other avenues of relief (i.e. the ERAB) before submitting their request to the AFBCMR. 10.1.4.  Retired  or  separated  personnel  are  not  eligible  to  apply  for  correction  through  the ERAB; therefore, they must submit a DD Form 149 to the AFBCMR. 10.2.  Program Elements. 10.2.1.  Who  Establishes  the  Board.    The  Commander,  Headquarters  Air  Force  Personnel Center (HQ AFPC/CC) directs the Chief of AF Evaluation Programs to establish an Evaluation Report  Appeals  Board  (ERAB)  to  assess  requests  to  correct  evaluations  and  to  correct substantiated  errors  or  injustices  for  RegAF.    The  Commander,  Headquarters  Air  Reserve Personnel Center (HQ ARPC/CC) directs the establishment of the ERAB to assess requests to correct evaluations and to correct substantiated errors or injustices on ARC personnel. 10.2.1.1.  For  officer  appeals,  the  board  president  must  be  at  minimum  an  Air  Force commissioned  officer  or  civilian  in  the  grade  of  O-5/GS-12  and  above.    For  enlisted appeals, the board president must be equal to or higher than the requester or at a minimum an Air Force SNCO or civilian in the grade of E-7/GS-9. 10.2.1.2.  Each Board will consist of a three-person panel composed of two board members and a board president.  A board member or president who was, or is, an evaluator for an applicant cannot consider that person's appeal. 10.2.1.3.  The  ERAB  works  under  the  assumption  that  evaluations  are  accurate  and objective.  The applicant filing an appeal must provide strong evidence to overcome the evaluation's presumed validity beyond a reasonable doubt. 10.2.2.  Who  Administers  the  Appeal  Process.    The  Evaluations  Programs  Section  (HQ AFPC/DP2SPE  and  HQ  ARPC/PB)  manages  the  appeals  process  and  executes  board decisions.    Following  the  Board’s  decision,  destroys  all  working  papers,  memoranda, worksheets, recommendations, and notes between the board members or between the Board and the Evaluation Section which pertain to the case.  The Board does not create nor maintain formal records of proceedings. 272 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 10.2.3.  How the Board Will Operate: 10.2.3.1.  Board Members Review applications and make recommendations to the ERAB President. 10.2.3.2.  The ERAB President: the  member's  request,  considers  each  board  member’s 10.2.3.2.1.  Reviews recommendations, and makes the final decision for the appeal. 10.2.3.2.2.  Acts for the full Board on applications which involve administrative and technical  corrections,  or  in  cases  that  clearly  lack  the  evidence  necessary  for presentation to the full board, or in cases that require waiving the time limit for an appeal. 10.2.3.3.  The Board: 10.2.3.3.1.  May be formal or informal. 10.2.3.3.2.  Does  not  permit  personal  appearances.    Neither  applicants  nor  their representatives can appear before the ERAB. 10.2.3.3.3.  Handles  all  appeals  confidentially  and  does  not  normally  disclose information to outside agencies. 10.2.3.3.4.  Refers cases for action to appropriate agencies or individuals, such as Air Force Office of Special Investigations, unit commander, and so on, if documents or statements do not appear to be authentic.  The Manual for Courts-Martial specifies penalties for creating false or forged official statements and documents.  Civilian Air Force employees may be punished under federal law. 10.2.3.3.5.  Reviews  cases  based  on  information  supplied  in  the  application.    The ERAB is not an investigative body and does not solicit additional documentation in support of an application.  However, if the board decides to consider information that was not available to the applicant, the ERAB will notify the applicant and allow him/her time to comment on the information.  EXCEPTION:  Information contained in PDS or the MPerRGp. 10.2.3.3.6.  Directs removal, inclusion, substitution and/or corrections to evaluations.  The ERAB is authorized to modify evaluations that differ from the applicant's request, (i.e. the applicant request the report be voided because the feedback date is incorrect; the  ERAB  may  deny  voiding  the  report  and  instead  direct  the  feedback  date  be corrected). 10.2.4.  Prohibited Requests.  The Board will not consider nor approve requests to: 10.2.4.1.  Void an evaluation when the error or injustice can be corrected administratively. 10.2.4.2.  Void an evaluation while keeping attachments to that evaluation. 10.2.4.3.  Void an evaluator's section while keeping comments or ratings of subsequent evaluators. 10.2.4.4.  Void an evaluator's comments, but keep the ratings (or vice versa). 10.2.4.5.  Delete required information or add unauthorized information to an evaluation. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 273 10.2.4.6.  Change (except for deletions) an evaluator's ratings or comments if the evaluator does not support the change.  When an evaluator supports changing ratings, all subsequent evaluators must also agree to the changes, (including the commander on EPRs, the reviewer on OPRs, and the MLR Board President on PRFs); see Attachment 2, paragraph A2.3. 10.2.4.7.  Re-accomplish  an  evaluation  without  the  applicant  furnishing  the  new evaluation. 10.2.4.8.  Void, correct or change an evaluation that does not meet the 3-year time limit without a waiver, see paragraph 10.5. 10.2.4.9.  Correct or rewrite an evaluation post-board based solely on the omission of an optional  statement,  or  to  make  the  evaluation  stronger  (i.e.  PME/DE/Assignment recommendations, awards, deployment information, SR endorsement and/or stratification are  not  mandatory,  therefore  omission  of  any  does  not  make  the  report  inaccurate  or unjust). 10.2.4.10.  Void  or  correct  an  evaluation  because  an  action,  (i.e.  UIF,  Control  Roster, Article 15, etc.), was removed: 10.2.4.10.1.  Early or on the disposition date.  Removal does not mean the action did not take place.  If the corrective action existed on or before the close-out date of the evaluation, the evaluation is still valid. 10.2.4.10.2.  Because the corrective action was “set-aside.”  If the corrective action (i.e. Article 15) was “set-aside,” but the behavior that led to the corrective action is still valid  and  the  behavior  existed  on  or  before  the  close-out  date  of  the  report,  the evaluation  may  still  be  valid  if  the  report  only  reflects  the  behavior  and  not  the corrective action that was “Set Aside.”  If the action that was “Set Aside” is mentioned in the evaluation, the ERAB would only remove the reference to it; not the behavior that led to the action.  EXAMPLES: 10.2.4.10.2.1.  The ratee received an Article 15 for DUI, and later the Article 15 was set aside for reasons other than innocence.  However, the report only states “Used poor judgment—picked up for DUI.”  Since the ratee was picked up for DUI, and the evaluation does not mention the Article 15, the evaluation is still a valid report. 10.2.4.10.2.2.  The ratee received an Article 15 for DUI, and later the Article 15 was  set  aside  for  reasons  other  than  innocence.    The  report  states  “Used  poor judgment—rcvd  Art  15  for  DUI.”    In  this  case,  the  ERAB  would  not  void  the evaluation  but  would  correct  the  evaluation  to  reflect  “Used  poor  judgment— DUI.” 10.2.4.10.2.3.  For  the  ERAB  to  decide  favorably  to  void  the  evaluation,  the applicant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the behavior did not take  place  and  the  corrected  action  taken  was  officially  set  aside  and  not  just removed or expired.   274 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 10.2.5.  Appeals based on Promotion/Career Opportunity.  Although not prohibited, ERAB requests based solely on a willingness by evaluators to change evaluations after non-selection for promotion will not be favorably considered unless proven the evaluation was erroneous or unjust based on content, see Attachment 2, paragraph A2.5.1. 10.3.  Correcting Evaluations. 10.3.1.  Prior  to  Becoming  a  Matter  of  Record.    Once  a  digital  signature  is  applied,  the comments and ratings are locked and cannot be changed.  In addition, the digital signatures cannot be deleted.  If a correction needs to be made after the form has been digitally signed, then the rater will need to re-accomplish the form.  He/she will be able to copy the text areas from the erroneous form and paste them into the new form.  The corrections can be made and the form resigned.  The form will reflect the date of the new signature. 10.3.2.  Appealing Evaluations and Requesting Changes After Evaluations Have Become a Matter of Record.  See paragraph 1.4.3. to determine when an evaluation becomes a matter of record.  Applicants must exhaust all avenues of relief before submitting their requests to the AFBCMR.  The other avenues available are: 10.3.2.1.  Administrative  Correction.    See  Table  10.2.  to  determine  if  the  requested correction can be made through administrative procedures without referral to the ERAB or AFBCMR.  Due to the electronic process only HQ AFPC/DPS2PE can make corrections to evaluations; and in most cases, once an evaluation becomes a matter of record, even administrative corrections will require an applicant to submit an ERAB.  An example of a case that would not require an ERAB or AFBCMR would be when a report is not viewable in ARMS.  In this case a simple email would suffice; or when the “YE” is not updated in PDS.  In this case the MPS should be contacted; since these changes does not require the evaluation itself to be corrected. 10.3.2.2.  When the correction cannot be corrected administratively, the next avenue of relief is through the ERAB.  Procedures for appealing evaluations through the ERAB are prescribed in this chapter. 10.3.2.3.  If  the  correction  cannot  be  corrected  administratively,  the  ERAB  denies  the appeal, or the requested action is not authorized by this chapter, the next avenue of relief would be through the AFBCMR.  Procedures can be found in AFI 36-2603. 10.3.2.4.  Airman  Comprehensive  Assessment  (ACA)  worksheets  and  sessions  are  not subject to appeal. 10.3.3.  Any changes or corrections that substantially alter the content from the original version require  original  signatures  from  all  evaluators.    If  an  evaluator  (other  than  the  rater)  is unavailable (due to retirement, for example) and all attempts to contact him or her have failed, the individual who replaced the missing evaluator must sign the evaluation.  When correcting an administrative error prior to the evaluation becoming a matter of record, and one or more of the evaluators are unavailable (due to retirement, for example) to sign the re-accomplished evaluation,  an  Air  Force  Personnel  official  (officer  or  SNCO)  in  the  MPS  will  certify  the authenticity of the comments of the missing evaluator.  The Commander/Superintendent, MPS is  the  lowest  level  which  will  authenticate  a  missing  signature.    The  SR  may  also  certify authenticity.  To do this, copy the evaluator's comments and ratings verbatim, and place the following statement in the block where the missing evaluator would have signed: "Original AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 275 Signed."  Enter in the right margin (on the reverse side of the form) the grade, name, signature, duty title, unit of the certifying official, and the original date signed.  NOTE:  When utilizing the “original signed” all other signatures must be “wet” signed.  Digital signatures are not authorized. 10.3.4.  Re-accomplish  evaluations  containing  an  excessive  number  of  erasures,  change sentence meaning, or requiring corrections to the ratings.  Do not use paper correction tape.  Do not correct ratings. 10.3.5.  Evaluations will not be appealed under Chapter 10 or AFI 36-2603 before becoming a matter of record. 10.3.6.  For PRF corrections, see paragraph 8.5. and Attachment 2, paragraph A2.6. 10.3.7.  Corrected Copies of Digitally Signed Documents.  See paragraph 1.4.5.2. 10.4.  Responsibilities. 10.4.1.  The Military Personnel Section (MPS). 10.4.1.1.  Responsible for training the base population on the ERAB process. 10.4.1.1.1.  A detailed explanation of the new process and complete documentation for the new process can be found in the PSD Guide. 10.4.1.1.2.  Detailed training information is also available on myPers. 10.4.1.2.  Retains only an advisory role in the ERAB process and will provide guidance to members after they have exhausted support from their local HR specialist.  EXCEPTION:  When the request is initiated by someone other than the ratee, or the ratee does not have access to the vMPF/vPC.  See paragraph 10.4.1.3. and paragraph 10.4.5. 10.4.1.3.  Opens a CMS case when paragraph 10.4.5. is applicable.  See paragraph in the PSD Guide for instructions. 10.4.2.  The Unit/Group Level Human Resource (HR) Specialist. 10.4.2.1.  The HR Specialist will have a very limited role in the ERAB appeal process.  However, the HR Specialist must have a basic knowledge of the process and be able to provide applicants with guidance on how to access the HQ AFPC Evaluations/vPC.  (T-0). 10.4.2.2.  The HR Specialist may be asked to provide HQ AFPC/DP2SPE or HQ ARPC/PB  copies of UIF if applicable, or other documents kept at the unit/group level. 10.4.2.3.  The HR Specialist may be required to open a CMS case when paragraph 10.4.5. is applicable.  See the PSD Guide for instructions. 10.4.3.  The Total Force Service Center (TFSC) Personnel. 10.4.3.1.  Must  be  knowledgeable  of  the  appeals  process,  thoroughly  familiar  with  the contents of this AFI, and in particular, must carefully review Attachment 2. 10.4.3.2.  General Responsibilities.  When an applicant contacts the TFSC regarding the ERAB process, the TFSC will: 10.4.3.2.1.  Be  responsible  for  answering  customer  inquiries  concerning  corrections and appeals. 276 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 10.4.3.2.2.  Determine if the correction is minor or requires a formal application by the member.    Minor  corrections  will  be  processed  by  the  applicable  office  of  primary responsibility IAW Table 10.2.  NOTE:  Any and all corrections involving AF Forms 709,  Promotion  Recommendation  Forms  (PRFs)  and  AF  Forms  3538,  Retention Recommendation Forms (RRFs) will immediately be forwarded to HQ AFPC/DP2SPE for correction. 10.4.3.2.3.

Advise member that it takes approximately 30-90 days (AD) or 90-120 days (ARC) to process a case, and if they are requesting a correction to be completed before a board to please plan accordingly.  Expedited cases must reach HQ AFPC/DP2SPE no later than 45 days before the board convening date, (not  applicable  for  ARC).    NOTE:    Although  every  attempt  is  made  to  get  cases completed prior to a pending board, there is no guarantee that an application will be completed prior to the board. 10.4.3.3.  The TFSC will provide a cadre of specialists to act as liaisons for, and provide guidance to, base level commanders and MPS/HR Specialist personnel for any questions related to the ERAB process or to check on the status of an application.  AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 277 10.4.4.  The Applicant. 10.4.4.1.  Submits  request  for  correction,  insertion  or  removal  of  evaluations  via  the vMPF/vPC,  see  the  PSD  Guide  for  guidance.    All  requests  are  submitted  thru  the vMPF/vPC/CMS unless authority is granted otherwise (see paragraph 10.4.4.1.2). 10.4.4.1.1.  If applicant does not have access to the vMPF/vPC, he/she may contact the servicing MPS/HR Specialist who will open a CMS/vPC case. 10.4.4.1.2.  If applicant does not have access to the vMPF and the servicing MPS/HR Specialist,  then  he/she  must  obtain  HQ  AFPC/DP2SPE  approval.    If  approved,  the applicant  must  submit  an  AF  Form  948,  Application  for  Correction/Removal  of Evaluation Report, see Table 10.6 for instructions.  AF Form 948 will be authorized only on  a case-by-case  basis, and under extremely  extenuating circumstances,  (i.e., someone who is in confinement and has absolutely no access to the vMPF).  Non-availability waiver requests due to being out-of-the office, on leave or TDY, will not be approved, (not applicable for ARC). 10.4.4.2.  Clearly and concisely state what he/she wants (i.e., “Request my EPR rendered for the period 1 Jan 08 – 31 Dec 08 be removed,” or “Correct the duty title in my EPR that closed out on 15 Jun 08”). 10.4.4.3.  Supply clear and credible evidence to support your application, see Attachment 2. 10.4.4.3.1.  Supporting statements are required when making changes to an evaluation and must have dates and signatures.  These statements must relate specifically to the period of the contested report.

Applicant’s may contact the TFSC for guidance and application procedures. 10.4.4.6.  Corrected Copies.  See paragraph 1.4.5.2. and paragraph 1.4.5.3. 10.4.5.  Corrections Initiated by Someone Other than the ratee.  When someone other than the ratee finds an error in an evaluation, they will: 10.4.5.1.  Determine if the evaluation can be corrected administratively IAW Table 10.2. 10.4.5.2.  Take  corrective  action  by  contacting  the  MPS/HR  Specialist  to  initiate  a CMS/vPC case, or have the ratee to take corrective action on his/her own behalf via the vMPF/vPC. (T-0). 278 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 10.4.5.3.  Provide a statement from the ratee, acknowledging he/she is aware of the pending action and concur/non-concur with the request.  NOTE:  The ratee does not have to concur to submit the request.  This statement is for acknowledgement purposes only, and gives the ratee an opportunity to dispute the action. 10.4.5.3.1.  If the ratee disagrees, he/she must explain why the correction should not be approved and suggest an alternative.  The omission of any remarks will be considered acceptance by the ratee. 10.4.5.3.2.  If the ratee is unavailable to submit a statement, send a copy of the appeal to the member with a memorandum explaining the error, and ask the member to provide written  comments  within  10  calendar  days  from  the  date  received.    To  ensure  the member has had an opportunity to review the appeal, have him/her acknowledge receipt on the statement or use certified mail to document the date of receipt. 10.4.5.3.3.  Reasonable requests for an extension of the time limit should be approved. 10.4.5.3.4.  When  the  member  provides  written  comments,  submit  the  applicant's response and a copy of the memorandum with the application. 10.4.5.3.5.  If  the  member  fails  to  respond,  annotate  the  remarks  section  of  the application with, "Comments from the ratee were requested but not received."  Attach a copy of the memorandum and either the member’s acknowledgment or the certified mail receipt with the application. 10.4.6.  HQ AFPC/DP2SPE and HQ ARPC/DPT. 10.4.6.1.  Review all ERAB applications for compliance with this AFI. 10.4.6.2.  Process all applications that meet the requirements for submitting an ERAB. 10.4.6.3.  Return  all  applications  that  do  not  meet  the  requirements  for  submitting  an ERAB. 10.4.6.4.  When applicable, make corrections to evaluations; update PDS; and forward the corrected evaluations to the appropriate offices. 10.4.6.5.  Notify applicant of results via the vMPF/vPC or email.  (T-0). 10.4.6.6.  Provide guidance to commanders, MPS and HR Specialist as required. 10.5.  Meeting Time Limits and Expedited Requests. 10.5.1.  Time Limits. 10.5.1.1.  You must submit your appeal within 3 years following the date the evaluation became a matter of record.  If you do not know the exact date, add 2 months to the date the final evaluator signed the evaluation. 10.5.1.2.  If the evaluation is more than 3 years old, you must submit a waiver of the time limit, see Attachment 2, paragraph A2.4. 10.5.1.3.  Normal processing time for appeal applications is 90-120 days from a completed application.  This does not include periods which applications are returned for corrections or missing documents. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 279 10.5.1.4.  Promotion  Boards  are  closed  out  (cut-off)  30  to  45  days  prior  to  the  board convening date.  In order to process an appeal in time, AFPC/DP2SPE or ARPC/PB must receive the appeal no later than 45 day before the cut-off date, (90 days before the particular special  selection  board  or  supplemental  board).    Although  every  attempt  is  made  to expedite these cases, there is no guarantee that the case will be worked in time to meet the particular board, even when the case is marked “Expedited.” 10.5.2.  Expedited Processing. 10.5.2.1.  If you must resolve an appeal before a specific date or event, such as a pending promotion  or  special  selection  board,  you  must  submit  your  application  to  HQ AFPC/DP2SPE (RegAF) or HQ ARPC/PB (ARC) no later than 90 days before the specific date or event. 10.5.2.2.  See the PSD Guide for procedures for requesting expedited processing. 10.5.2.3.  The only cases that will be accepted for expedited processing after the 90-day cut-off will be evaluations, including PRFs, that have closed out within 90 days of the board convening date. 10.6.  Using Classified, Privacy Act, and Restricted Release Information: 10.6.1.  Do not include classified information in the body of an appeal.  You may, if necessary, include classified information in attachments.  The applicant ensures classified attachments are submitted in accordance with security directives establishing control and mailing rules. 10.6.2.  When submitting documents on someone else (i.e. evaluations on other individuals, AF Forms 2096, Classification/On-The-Job Training Action, PCS orders, travel vouchers, etc., on supervisors or coworkers),  you must submit  a statement from the  concerned individual granting you permission to submit the particular document.  Applications that do not comply will be returned without action.  The applicant may then resubmit the application with the permission statement, or remove the document from his/her application. 10.6.3.  If you feel that information in a restricted release file is essential to your case, you may ask the releasing agency to forward the information directly to HQ AFPC/DP2SPE or ARPC.  When submitting your request to the releasing agency, you must waive, in writing, the right to review the information.  Include a copy of this waiver with the appeal application.  When the Board has decided the appeal, HQ AFPC/DP2SPE or ARPC/PB destroys the restricted file or returns it to the releasing agency. 10.7.  Requesting Special Selection Board (SSB) or Supplemental Promotion Consideration: 10.7.1.  RegAF officers can, in conjunction with their appeal, request SSB consideration for promotion, RegAF appointment, In-resident PME, Selective Early Retirement, or Reduction-in-Force separation boards.  You should review AFI 36-2501, for additional information on SSBs. 10.7.2.  AFR  officers  can,  in  conjunction  with  their  appeal,  request  SSB  consideration  for promotion.  You should review AFI 36-2504, Officer Promotion, Continuation, and Selective Early Removal in the Reserve of the Air Force for additional information on SSBs. 10.7.3.  RegAF  enlisted  personnel  may  request  supplemental  promotion  consideration  in conjunction  with  the  appeal  application.    Such  a  request  must  be  indicated  on  the  appeal 280 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 application; however, squadron commander’s  concurrence is required  when submitting the request.  The commander must complete the endorsement on Personnel Processing Application (PPA) by using the HR Review button in CMS; by submitting a statement for application submitted by someone other than the ratee; or by signing the AF Form 948 when the applicant does  not  have  access  to  the  vMPF  or  MPS/HR  Specialist,  see  paragraph  10.4.4.1.2.    The commander must indicate concurrence or non-concurrence and provide an explanation for non-concurrence. 10.8.  Resubmitting an Appeal: 10.8.1.  Applicants can resubmit an appeal only if they have substantial new evidence which the board did not initially consider. 10.8.1.1.  Do not resubmit an application when the only documentation added to the case is a statement which simply rebuts the ERAB’s previous decision.  The ERAB does not view  a  rebuttal  statement  as  new  evidence  and  will  decline  to  reconsider  the  case.  Statements  from  members  of  the  rating  chain  which  respond  directly  to  questions  or concerns posed in the previous decision memorandum are acceptable new evidence. 10.8.1.2.  Include all previous documentation with the new application. 10.8.2.  If dissatisfied with the decision of the ERAB, submit an appeal to the AFBCMR, see paragraph 10.1.3.   AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 281 Table 10.1.  How to Submit Requests for Correction.

The error is considered minor if the request is to correct an error in: 1  The Ratee identification data: Name, grade, Social Security Number (SSN), (component, ANG/AFR only), or organizational element, or the identification data of an evaluator who signed the evaluation. Name, grade, SSN, duty title, organizational element, date of signature, or final evaluator's position. Education or Promotion or TIG/TIS eligible blocks   See Notes 1, 2, and 3. Go to Table 10.3. 2  The Ratee's Duty Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC), duty title, or level of duty.  Enlisted:  DAFSC must be reflected in the ratee’s duty history.  Officers:  Not an administrative correction.  Applicant must submit an ERAB via the vMPF/vPC.  For ADL officers, the DAFSC authorization must be approved by the applicable HQ AFPC Assignment Functional Manager and reflected in the ratee’s duty history. NOTE: The MPS/HR Specialist performs the duty history update once duty title is approved.  See Notes 1, 4, and 8.  Go to Table 10.3. 3  The "from" or "thru" date of the evaluation, the number of days of supervision, or the reason for evaluation. See Notes 1, 5 and 6.  Go to Table 10.3. 4  The marking of a concur or non-concur box, or to add a missing rating.  See Notes 1 and 7. Go to Table 10.3. 5  Spelling, punctuation, or heading in an evaluator's comments.  See Notes 1, 9, and 10. Go to Table 10.3. 6  The ratee's name or grade in an evaluator's comments.  See Notes 1 and 9. Go to Table 10.3. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 283 Notes:  (T-0) 1.  Do not make corrections using this table if any doubt exists about the appropriateness of the request. Instead, submit a formal application IAW Table 10.1. with the questionable circumstances fully outlined. Any person who knows of an error that is correctable under Table 10.2. should bring it to the attention of the MPS Evaluations or the records custodian responsible for maintaining the original evaluation. 2.  Submit an application according to Table 10.1. if the request is to change or add signatures, change or add signature dates on referral evaluations and supporting documents, and/or to substitute a re-accomplished evaluation.  Changes to the final evaluator's position (AF Form 911) will be made only when the MPS Evaluations or the records custodian having custody of the original evaluation determines conclusively that an error exists.  Do not correct TIG eligibility as an administrative correction; it must be corrected through the ERAB. 3.  If a Supplemental Promotion Board (SSB), or the AFBCMR has changed an individual’s grade due to retroactive promotion resulting from a review, submit a request according to Table 10.1.  In these cases, the evaluation will be annotated with a statement that reads “Member promoted to **** with a retroactive effective date prior to the date this evaluation was rendered.” 4.  You can change the evaluation when approved documentation existed on or before the close-out date of the evaluation and a CSB has not considered the evaluation.  If approved documentation did not exist, was subsequently approved, or the contested evaluation has been considered by a CSB, submit a request according to Table 10.1. 5.  If a correction to either the period of the evaluation or the number of days of supervision would invalidate the requirement for that or any other evaluation on file, you must submit a request according to Table 10.1. 6.  If changing the close date of an enlisted evaluation would result in the ratee receiving a supplemental promotion consideration, the Rater must submit a request according to Table 10.1. 7.  Caution: Take extreme care when adding missing ratings or correcting concur/non-concur boxes.  Submit an application IAW Table 10.1. any time the Rater’s or endorser’s rating(s) are missing and the non-concur box is also marked, or neither box is marked.  However, you can correct an unmarked or mismarked concur or non-concur box when, after reviewing the evaluator’s comments and ratings, there is no question as to which box should have been marked.  If a rating is also missing or doubt exists, submit an application according to Table 10.1. 8.  Submit a formal application according to Table 10.1. to request changes to the Unit Mission Description or the Job Description. 9.  Do not change references such as Airman or Sergeant to reflect the person’s actual grade. 10.  Do not change words (other than misspellings), phrases, sentence structure, or grammar under this table.    284 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016  A If the correction is authorized IAW Table 10.3.

If the request is invalid, incomplete or questionable, return it through any previous processing levels to the correction initiator with appropriate instructions.  The initiator must identify all required changes because changing an evaluation’s closing date can change the number of days of supervision, the reason for evaluation, the signature dates, or the "from" date of the subsequent evaluation. 3.

For evaluations being re-accomplished, you can annotate the signature blocks of evaluators not reasonably available ORIGINAL SIGNED.  If used, the comments and ratings of the evaluators must be copied verbatim from the original evaluation.  NOTE:  All measures must be exhausted before this measure can be used. 3.  For voided evaluations (excluding imbedded training reports and PRFs), prepare an AF Form 77 with the statement: "Not rated for the above period.  Evaluation was removed by Order of the Chief of Staff, USAF."  If voiding evaluations for two or more consecutive reporting periods, you can prepare one AF Form 77, but you must show the close-out dates of each evaluation.  4.  For voided imbedded training reports, prepare an AF Form 77 with the statement: "A training report for the above period was removed by Order of the Chief of Staff, USAF."  For missing imbedded training reports, no action will be taken since there is no gap in the ratee’s record.  The best course of action is to obtain a certified true copy (CTC) (see paragraph 1.4.5.2.) or a replacement TR and request it be included through the ERAB. 286 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 5.  For a voided PRF, enter the statement: "AF Form 709, Promotion Recommendation, for promotion board (specify the promotion board, for example, 0589A) was removed by Order of the Chief of Staff, USAF."

Vice President of the United States, SecDef, CJSC, SecAF and CSAF.  For purposes of the AFI, these units are also known as MLs. Acquisition  Examiner—A  person,  either  within  the  rating  chain  or  appointed  by  the  ML (minimum colonel/captain (USN) or  civilian equivalent for officers; major or Navy lieutenant commander or an equivalent civilian for enlisted) serving in an acquisition position and in the same acquisition  career  field  as  the  ratee  who  provides  examination  of  evaluations  for  individuals serving in certain acquisition positions (paragraph 1.6.8.).

Advisor—An Air Force designated representative who provides a special review of evaluations in  activities  outside  the  DAF  (paragraph  1.6.8.).    The  Air  Force  Advisor  advises  non-DAF evaluators of Air Force rating policies and procedures and reviews OPRs, EPRs, and PRFs for compliance with the provisions of this instruction. Aggregation—The process used when the number of eligible officers does not meet the minimum number required for the senior rater to award promotion recommendations. Air Force Level Student—Receives Training  Reports and Narrative-Only PRF.  The eligible officer's records meet the Air Force Student Review since Air Force Level Students do not have senior raters.  Training is outside the officer's utilization field. Air National Guard (ANG) Non-AGR—Refers to members of the Air National Guard who are serving in Title 32 status, not on Extended Active Duty (EAD) nor assigned in permanent Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) or Statutory Tour status.

Carry-over—For  line  officers,  the  difference  between  the  "Definitely  Promote"  allocations (rounded up) based on the population of an ML, and the sum of "Definitely Promote" allocations authorized senior raters (rounded down) based on each senior rater's population (including those senior raters whose population is aggregated). Civilian Director—Civilians designated to lead  units/organizations (PAS codes[s]), excluding Flight Commanders.  Also see Other Authorized Reviewers. Commander—The commander (or officer so designated) for administrative purposes (that is, control roster action, Article 15 jurisdiction, and so on) of the ratee's assigned organization. Also see Other Authorized Reviewers. Company Grade—Officers in the grades of second lieutenant through captain. Combat Zone—That area required by combat forces for the conduct of operations.  The territory forward of the Army rear area boundary. Commander’s Review—See Other Authorized Reviewer. Communications Zone—Rear part of theater of operations (behind but contiguous to the combat zone) which contains the lines of communications, establishments for supply and evacuation, and AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 301 other agencies required for the immediate support and maintenance of the field forces.  See also combat zone; rear area. “Definitely Promote (DP)" (lieutenant colonels and below)—Recommendation on AF Form 709 that says the strength of the ratee's performance and performance-based potential alone warrants promotion; (colonels only)—Recommendation on AF Form 709 which indicates an officer demonstrates the potential for immediate promotion. "Do Not Promote This Board (DNP)"(colonels and below)—Recommendation on AF Form 709 that says the ratee does not warrant promotion on the Central Selection Board (CSB) for which the PRF is being prepared. “Duty Qualification History Brief”—A computer product used by senior raters in the Promotion Recommendation Process which includes such whole person factors as DE, advanced academic information, board certification, joint duty and acquisition corps data and award and decoration information. Effective Date of Change of Strength Accountability—The date an individual is dropped from the strength accountability of one PAS and gained to strength accountability of another PAS.  The effective  date  a  member  is  assigned  to  or  between  units  of  the  AFR  or  to  a  specific  Reserve program (participating or nonparticipating). Evaluations—A general reference to the ACA (AF Forms 724, 931, and 932), OPR (AF Form 707), PRF (AF Form 709), Education/Training Report (TR, AF Form 475), Letter of Evaluation (AF Form 77), and the general officer promotion recommendation (AF Form 78), and EPR (AF Forms 910, 911 and 912). Evaluator—Any individual who signs a performance evaluation in a rating capacity. Field Grade—Officers in the grade of major through colonel. Final Evaluator—The evaluator in the rating chain who closes out an OPR or EPR  (Officer)-- The senior rater will be the final evaluator (EXCEPTION: See paragraph 1.6.4.).  (Enlisted)—For MSgt selects, MSgts, SMSgt selects and SMSgts, the last evaluator to endorse the AF Form 911 will be the final evaluator (Section IX).  For CMSgts and CMSgt selects, the senior rater will be the final evaluator (AF Form 912).  When the rater is a O-6 or above, or a civilian (GS-15 or above), and qualifies as a single evaluator (see definition of single evaluator) and they may close-out the evaluation at their level as a final evaluator, unless they refer the evaluation.  When the rater/additional rater is a O-6 or civilian (GS-15 or above) who works directly for the senior rater, and the ratee is not TIG eligible for senior rater endorsement, the EPR will be closed out by the rater/additional  rater  [deputy  evaluator].    When the  rater  is  a  senior  rater  or  the  Chief  Master Sergeant of the Air Force, the EPR will close-out at their level. Forced Distributor (FD) (also referred to as FDID authority)—The evaluator designated to complete the Promotion Recommendation section of the AF Form 910.  For wing/group/squadron organizational structures, the FD will be the designated unit commander (typically C-prefix) on G-Series  orders  or  civilian  director  for  squadrons  (may  not  be  delegated  to  squadron  section commanders), the group commander for group staff assigned personnel only according to the Unit Manpower Document, and the wing vice commander (Director of staff  if delegated) for those personnel assigned, according to the Unit Manpower Document, to wing staff agencies only (e.g. JA, PA, HC, CP, EO, etc.).  For MAJCOMs, COCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, NAFs and Centers the FD 302 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 will be the military or civilian "director" and for MAJCOM/COCOM commanders will be the vice commander.  In cases where there is a subordinate organization/unit below the director and the subordinate organization unit commander is on G-Series orders, then the subordinate commander will serve as the FD for that subordinate unit, not the parent organization's "director".  There are six positions which are not constrained by the FD allocations:  President of the United States, Vice President of the United States, SECDEF, CJCS, SECAF, and CSAF.  NOTE:  If the officer filling one of these roles is from a sister-service they must be an O-5 or higher to serve as an FD. Forced Distributor Identification (FDID)—A nine digit code (first two digits is the Management ID; the third, fourth and fifth digits are the Senior Rater code; sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth digits are the last four of the unit PAS code) which will provide identification to the PAS codes just as with the Senior Rater IDs. Inappropriate  Items—Items  that  evaluators  must  not  consider  or  refer  to  when  recording performance (see paragraph 1.12.). Individual  Mobilization  Augmentee  (IMA)—An  individual  filling  a  funded  authorization identified  as  augmenting  the  RegAF  components  within  departments  or  agencies  of  the  U.S. Government. This is further defined by Joint Publication 1-02 which states, in part: an individual  reservist  attending  drills  who  receives  training  and  is  pre-assigned  to  an  active component organization,  or  a  Selective  Service  System  billet  that  must  be  filled  on,  or  shortly  after, mobilization. Last Duty Day—The day before an individual's departure from his/her station for PCS, retirement, separation, terminal leave, leave in conjunction with PCS, or unit PCA. Limited EAD—RASL member serving on EAD for a specified period of time and in a specified grade to pursue special work. Terms of service are to be spelled out in a contract per 10 U.S.C. 12311 and 12312. Matter of Record—All digitally signed evaluations are considered a matter of record once they are loaded into ARMS. “Wet” signature evaluations are made a matter of record once they are loaded into ARMS. All evaluations are considered working copies until they are made a matter of record.  See paragraph 1.4.3. Mandatory  Comments—Comments  evaluators  must  include  in  EPRs,  OPRs,  and  TRs  (see paragraph 1.11.). Matter of Record (Officer)—All digitally signed evaluations are considered a matter of record once they are loaded into ARMS. “Wet” signature evaluations on all officers and SNCOs are considered  a  matter  of  record  once  they  have  been  filed  in  the  OSR/NSR.  “Wet”  signature evaluations on TSgt and below are made a matter of record once they are loaded into ARMS. All evaluations are considered working copies until they are made a matter of record. Military and Civilian Grade Equivalents—For the purposes of this instruction, it is necessary to equate certain military grades with civilian grades. The appropriate authority, as listed below, determines equivalency based on the responsibilities and location of the civilian position in the rating chain (see AFI 36—3026, Identification Cards for Members of the Uniformed Services, their Eligible Family Members, and Other Eligible Personnel, Table A13.1. for grade comparison chart). AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 303 a. For officer grades—The  Reviewer/Senior  Rater  determines  equivalency  for  Raters  and Additional Raters. The ML determines equivalency for Reviewer/Senior Rater designations. b. For CMSgts selects and CMSgts (AF Form 912)—The ML determines equivalency for Senior Rater designations. Military Director—The military director designated to lead a unit/organization (PAS code[s]). Also see Other Authorized Reviewers. Military Technician (Dual Status)—Refers to members employed under 10 U.S.C 10216 or 32 U.S.C. 709. Follow ARC/ANG Non-AGR (Drill Status) for OPR/EPR policy. Technicians are considered drill status guardsmen/traditional reservists for reporting and rating purposes under  their military rating chain. ML—DoD organizations (i.e., major command) where the senior official evaluations directly to  the SecDef, SecAF, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff, CSAF, or State Adjutant General or Governor.  Only the CSAF may approve exceptions; however, the HQ USAF DCS, Personnel, may exercise similar authority in cases involving the MLs of general officers. No individual can  serve as the head of two separate MLs for the same board, unless the individual is serving in a dual-hatted capacity.  As used in this instruction, ML also refers to the personnel activity that  supports the senior official. ML—DoD organizations (i.e., major command) where the senior official evaluations directly to the SecDef, SecAF, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff, CSAF, or State Adjutant General or Governor. Only the CSAF may approve exceptions; however, the HQ USAF DCS, Personnel, may exercise similar authority in cases involving the MLs of general officers. No individual can serve as the head of two separate MLs for the same board, unless the individual is serving in a dual-hatted capacity. As used in this instruction, ML also refers to the personnel activity that supports the senior official. ML Control Group (Applies to GOs)—The number of promotion eligible GOs assigned to an ML, subdivided by grade and competitive category. ML  Review  (MLR)—A  process  used  in  the  Promotion  Recommendation  phase  of  the  OES (Chapter 8). ML Student—Receives TRs and normal PRFs. The eligible officers’ records meet the respective ML evaluation board as a separate category. Training is within the eligible officer's utilization field. MPerRGp—Consists of Officer Selection Record Group, SNCO Selection Record (AD only), and  Correspondence  and  Miscellaneous  Record  Group  (officer  and  airmen).  The  MPerRGp  is maintained at HQ AFPC for AD members, and at HQ ARPC for ARC members. Noncombat Ports and MPSs—All ports and MPSs not falling within either the combat zone or communications zone. Non Extended Active Duty (Non-EAD)—An Air Reserve Component member who is assigned to  an  Air  National  Guard  or  Air  Force  Reserve  unit,  performs  regularly  schedule  drills  (Unit Training Assembly), annual training,  and/or Equivalent Training.   This includes Drill Status Guardsmen, unit traditional reservist or Individual Reservist while in a Title 10 or Title 32 status.  These members are not on an Active Duty  tour (ex: Active Guard Reservist (AGR) or Voluntary 304 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 Limited Period of Active Duty [VLPAD]), however they may be on long tour such as military personnel appropriation (MPA) or reserve personnel Appropriations (RPA) orders. Non-Line—As used in this instruction, non-line is a collective general reference to legal officers (AFSC 51JX), chaplains (AFSC 52RX), and health profession officers (AFSC 4XXX). Offices of Record—The offices which maintain evaluations (original or copies). Other Authorized Reviewer—The unit commander/military or civilian director may designate in writing a senior official within his/her unit to perform the unit commander’s/military or civilian director’s review. If a flag officer is an evaluator on the AF Form 911 (only), he/she will serve as an  “Other  Authorized  Reviewer”  in  Section  VIII,  Unit  Commander/Military  or  Civilian Director/Other Authorized Reviewer. AF Form 910 must return to the Force Distributor for final endorsement and the AF Form 912 must return to the Senior Rater for final endorsement regardless of a flag officer endorsement within the evaluation. In MAJCOM/COCOM organizations the ML may designate in writing a senior Air Force official within subordinate elements of the staff to serve as a “other authorized reviewer” (e.g. Director of Staff, Director of Public Affairs, etc.). P-Rate—The promotion rate that guarantees the minimum promotion rate for eligible officers receiving a “Promote” recommendation. Performance Feedback—A progress evaluation from raters to ratees. Period of Report—The length of time covered by an evaluation. Period of Supervision—The period of time a member is under the supervision of a rater. PRF  Accounting  Date—The  date  that  determines  the  Senior  Rater  responsible  for  PRF preparation. The Senior Rater for the unit the eligible officer is assigned on this date is the Senior Rater  for  the  promotion  cycle.  For  officers  in  grades  lieutenant  colonel  and  below,  it  is approximately 150 days prior to the CSB convening date. For colonel, it is 60 days prior to the CSB convening date. PRF  Allocation  Date—Sixty-six  days  before  a  selection  board,  when  “Definitely  Promote” allocations are final (does not apply to ARC). PRF Cutoff Date—Sixty days prior to the selection board, when final PRF processing begins. PRFs cannot be completed prior to this date (does not apply to ARC). “Promote (P)” (lieutenant colonels and below)—Recommendation on AF Form 709 that says the ratee is qualified for promotion and should compete at the CSB on the basis of performance, performance-based  potential,  and  broader  considerations;  (colonels  only)--Recommendation  of AF Form 709 which indicates an officer is making a valuable contribution to the mission and has potential for promotion. Ratee—The individual being rated. Rater (officer and enlisted)—The official (usually the ratee's immediate supervisor) designated by  management  to  provide  a  ratee  periodic  performance  feedback  and  initiate  performance evaluations. The rater may be an officer or NCO (for enlisted ratees) of a United States or foreign military service serving in a grade equal to or higher than the ratee, or a civilian in a supervisory position that is higher than the ratee in the ratee’s rating chain. Management may appoint raters serving in the same grade as ratees without regard to date of rank. (enlisted)--A civilian rater must be at least a GS-7 or a comparable grade or higher. RegAF members in the grade of SrA may serve AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 305 as  raters  only  if  they  have  completed  the  NCO  Preparatory  Course  or  the  Airman  Leadership Course. Only non-active-duty AFR members in the grade of SSgt or above may serve as raters. Rater’s Rater (officer)—The second official in the rating chain, after the rater, serving in a grade equal to or higher than the rater and in a grade higher than the ratee. See paragraph 1.6.4. for other restrictions.  (enlisted)--The second official in the rating chain, after the rater, serving in a grade equal  to  or  higher  than  the  rater  (for  TSgts  and  below,  at  least  the  grade  of  MSgt  or  civilian equivalent). Rating  Chain—The  succession  of  officials  responsible  for  preparing  evaluations.    Evaluators other than the rater may be assigned after the close-out date.  Commanders set up the rating chain within  their  organization.    The  rating  chain  is  normally  the  same  as  the  supervisory  chain. EXCEPTIONS:  An individual in the supervisory chain may not be an EPR evaluator when the ratee is a TSgt or below and the rater’s rater does not meet the minimum grade requirement to be the additional rater.  When the ratee is a MSgt or higher, the final evaluator (AF Form 911, Section IX) does not have to be the immediate supervisor of the additional rater.  Flexibility in this case lets authorities better distinguish between individuals with similar performance records.  When the SRID  designates  more  than  one  position  as  a  senior  rater  within  a  common  rating  chain (EXAMPLE:  Headquarters Chief of Staff, vice commander, and commander), the senior rater who  signs  the  evaluation  does  not  have  to  be  the  rater’s  rater,  but  must  be  the  senior  rater designated for the ratee’s grade and assigned PAS (only one senior rater may sign an evaluation). Recommendation Only PRF—Refer to paragraph 8.1.5.6. (does not apply to ResAF). Record  of  Performance—Consists  of  the  following  AF  Forms  (when  filed  in  the  OSR):  AF Forms 707; AF Forms 707A and AF Forms 707B; AF Forms 709; Air Force Forms 475; Form 77.  Evaluators may also use LOEs filed in the CSS/HR Specialist. Referral Evaluation—A performance evaluation that contains any of the following is a referral: a—Comments in any OPR, EPR, LOE or Training Report, regardless of the ratings if applicable, or the attachments to that evaluation, that are derogatory in nature, imply or refer to behavior incompatible  with,  or  not  meeting  minimum  acceptable  standards  of  personal  or  professional conduct, character, judgment or integrity, and/or refer to disciplinary actions. This includes, but is not limited to, comments regarding omissions or misrepresentation of facts in official statements or  documents,  financial  irresponsibility,  mismanagement  of  personal  or  government  affairs, confirmed incidents of discrimination or mistreatment, illegal use or possession of drugs, AWOL, Article 15 action, and conviction by courts-martial. b—An officer fails to meet standards in any one of the listed performance factors, in Section III or Section IX of the OPR, the overall evaluation will be a "Does Not Meet Standards" evaluation and the evaluation must be referred. Relieved From Supervisory Responsibility—For evaluation purposes, this means an individual was  removed  from  supervisory  duties  due  to  either  personal  or  professional  shortcomings  or misconduct that, in the supervisor’s view, made the member incapable of handling, or unsuitable for holding, the position. Personnel removed from supervisory responsibility must be notified in writing and acknowledge understanding. Reserve Active Status List (RASL)—A list of all ARC officers in an active status, not on the ADL, and in the order of seniority of the grade in which they are serving. Officers serving in the 306 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 same grade are carried in order of their date of rank to that grade.  The RASL for the Air Force shall  include  officers  in  the  Air  National  Guard  and  Air  Force  Reserve.  Except  as  otherwise provided by law, an officer must be on the RASL to be eligible for consideration for selection for promotion, continuation, or selective early removal as a member of the Reserve of the Air Force. Reviewer—The  third  evaluator  on  an  Officer  Performance  Report  (see  paragraph  1.6.5). Reviewing Official—Any intermediate-level supervisor above the rater, but below the ML. Routinely—A repeated inability to meet standards that would render the aggregated performance assessment over the entire reporting period as below standards. Senior Rater (Officer)—The evaluator designated by the ML who completes the PRF and also serves as reviewer on the OPR.  Senior raters must be in a position to have personal knowledge or access  to  personal  knowledge  of  the  ratee's  performance.    They  must  also  have  the  scope  of responsibility and breadth of experience to assess performance and its significance as it relates to potential for promotion.  The same senior rater normally evaluates all officers in an organization in a particular grade and promotion zone.  For all majors and below, the senior rater must be at least a colonel (or equivalent) serving as a wing commander or equivalent.  For all lieutenant colonels and colonels, the senior rater must be a general officer (or equivalent) and will be the first general  officer  in  the  rating  chain  AFPC/DP2SPE  (ADL)  or  HQ  AFRC/A1  (AFR  unit)  must approve exceptions. Senior Rater (Enlisted)—Position that the MAJCOM, field operating agency, direct reporting unit, and other organizations with Air Force enlisted personnel designated to be the highest level endorser in the ratee's rating chain. For RegAF and ARC members, senior raters must be at least a colonel or civilian equivalent (GS-15 or higher), serving as a wing commander or equivalent. Senior Rater Identification Code—A five-character code identifying a senior rater position as the MAJCOM or ML specifies. Significant Disagreement—The disagreement by an evaluator with the previous evaluator that results  in  one  of  the  following:  A  change  of  any  Performance  Factor  rating  in  any  of  the performance  assessments;  or  any  statement  anywhere  in  an  OPR  that  indicates  obvious disagreement with the previous evaluator. Significantly—A single instance where failure to meet standards is either egregious in nature or so far short of a standard that it impacts overall aggregated performance assessment. Single Evaluator—An individual (O-6 or equivalent) who may close-out an EPR with a single signature  (also  see  the  definition  of  "final  evaluator").    Individual  must  meet  both  grade requirements and the evaluator requirements for each section of the applicable evaluation form (EXAMPLE:  must meet both grade requirements as an O-6 [or equivalent/higher grade] and must meet the definition of a “unit commander/military or civilian director/other authorized reviewer”). An O-6 or equivalent in and of themselves meet the grade requirement to serve as a final [deputy] evaluator on the AF Form 911, and/or as a final [senior rater] evaluator on the AF Form 911 and AF Form 912, provided they are designated as a senior rater by the ML; however they must also meet  the  necessary  requirements  as  a  unit  commander/  military  or  civilian  director/other authorized  reviewer  (see  definition  of  unit  commander/military  or  civilian  director/other authorized reviewer) to sign the entire evaluation as a “single evaluator”. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 307 Single Senior Rater—The Single Senior rater is not the head of the ML, but is the only senior rater who has I/APZ and/or Non-line BPZ eligibles. The ML review process must review PRFs. Sole Senior Rater—The Sole Senior Rater is the head of the ML and is the only senior rater who has I/APZ and/or Non-line BPZ eligibles for a specific board. The Sole Senior Rater awards all PRF recommendations; however, the HQ USAF MLR must review all PRF ratings. Static Close-Out Date (SCOD)—The date that all enlisted evaluations will close-out for a specific grade.  Also  the  date  used  to  determine  the  final  TIG/TIS  eligible  pool  for  senior  rater endorsement/stratification and forced distribution allocations. Stratification—Quantitative comparison of an individual standing among peers within a definable group and within a specific evaluators scope of authority (i.e., direct rating chain). Statutory Tour—A controlled tour of active duty service. Usually, a precise number of years at a specific location. Total Force Service Center (TFSC)—Formerly known as the Air Force Contact Center (AFCC). When referenced, use the applicable components TFSC; i.e., RegAF would use the TFSC at AFPC and the ANG AFR would use the TFSC at ARPC. Unit Commander/Military or Civilian Director—The military service member designated as the director of, or in command of, a unit (PAS code[s]).  A civilian equivalent, assigned to the position of director, or unit director, responsible for the unit (PAS code [s]). See paragraph 1.6.7. Whole  Airman  Factors—Factors  included  in  the  whole  person  assessment  include  job performance;  leadership;  professional  competence;  breadth  and  depth  of  experience;  job responsibility; academic and professional military education; and specific achievements.  308 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 Attachment 2 APPEAL GUIDANCE FOR APPLICANTS (LOCAL REPRODUCTION AUTHORIZED) A2.1.  Overview.  If you intend to file an appeal, you should read this attachment.  The Military Personnel Section (MPS), and Commander Support Staff (CSS/HR Specialist) technicians must be  familiar  with  the  contents  of  this  attachment.    In  this  attachment,  the  term  "evaluation" encompasses all versions of enlisted and officer performance reports, training reports, letter of evaluations, promotion recommendation forms, retention recommendation forms and any other forms used by SERB and RIF separation boards. Complying with the following guidelines will not guarantee  you  a  favorable  decision;  however,  not  complying  can  cause  the  board  to  delay  its decision, return your application without action, or not have sufficient information to reach a fair and equitable decision. A2.2.  Documenting  Your  Appeal.  You  must  provide  convincing  documentation  for  your appeal.  The willingness of evaluators to change an evaluation is not enough. Y ou must offer clear evidence that the original evaluation was unjust or wrong.  Quality, not quantity of documentation is the issue.  If the reason you are including a particular item of evidence is not obvious, explain why you have attached it to the application or what it proves.  Do not bother to submit general documents (letters of appreciation, character reference statements, nonspecific inspection reports, etc.).  If your application has many attachments, use tabs to separate them.  Before submitting your appeal, review the documents you have attached and make sure they are: A2.2.1.  Credible - does the support come from a person who is credible; was in a position to have firsthand knowledge of the situation and provide a reasoned evaluation?  (Or are they former  or  subsequent  supervisors,  peers,  friends,  onetime  customers,  etc.?)    If  you  are submitting a document, does it prove what it is supposed to?  EXAMPLE:  Shift schedules, OJT records, and feedback notices do not prove when supervision began. A2.2.2.  Relevant - to the time and issue.  Evaluations assess performance over a very specific period of time and your support must relate to that period.  Does your documentation stick to the issues (i.e., the basis for your appeal)?  EXAMPLE:  If you are appealing based on a “personality  conflict,”  general  character  references,  job  recommendations,  or  letters  of appreciation would do little to support the alleged “conflict” and usually are not relevant. A2.2.3.  Believable - from a common sense standpoint.  Look at your evidence dispassionately and ask, “Can I buy this?” A2.3.  Statements.  The most effective evidence consists of statements from the actual evaluators who signed the contested evaluation.  These statements should: A2.3.1.  Cite important facts or circumstances that were unknown when the evaluators signed the evaluation. A2.3.2.  Detail the error or injustice. A2.3.3.  Explain how and when it was discovered. A2.3.4.  Include the correct information. A2.3.5.  Relate to the contested reporting period. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 309 A2.3.6.  Address the allegations and substantially challenge or disprove comments or ratings in the evaluation. A2.3.7.  Contacting  Retirees.    To  contact  a  retired  person,  place  your  memorandum  in  a stamped envelope. A2.3.7.1.  Address the envelope partially by writing your name and return address, and the retired person's name. A2.3.7.2.  Enclose  the  partially  addressed  envelope  in  a  separate  envelope  to  the Worldwide  Locator  (HQ  AFPC/DPDXIDL,  550  C  St.  West,  Suite  50,  Joint  Base  San Antonio-Randolph TX 78150-4752). A2.3.7.3.  Include the retired person's grade, full name, and SSN, if known. A2.3.7.4.  Include a note explaining about the appeal and asking the Worldwide Locator to forward your memorandum. A2.4.  Time Limit Waivers.  The applicant can request a waiver of the 3-year time limit by citing unusual circumstances that prevented filing the appeal in a timely manner.  However, ratees are responsible for reviewing their records at least annually for accuracy and the board can consider the due diligence of the applicant to apply for correction.  Applications that do not include a waiver will be returned without action.  Grounds for a waiver do not include: A2.4.1.  Failing to understand the appeals process. A2.4.2.  Being discouraged from appealing by superiors, peers, or counselors. A2.4.3.  Failing to understand how serious an impact an evaluation could have on your career in later years. A2.4.4.  Not reviewing your records during the intervening years. A2.5.  Common Appeal Reasons and Related Documentation Requirements.  Some common reasons  for  appealing  and  types  of  documentation  are  outlined  below.    Complying  with  these guidelines will not ensure approval of a request. A2.5.1.  Impact on Promotion or Career Opportunity.  An evaluation is not erroneous or unfair because the applicant believes it contributed to a non-selection for promotion or may impact future  promotion  or  career  opportunities.    The  Board  recognizes  that  non-selection  for promotion is, for many, a traumatic event, and  the desire to overturn that non-selection is powerful  motivation  to appeal.    However,  the  Board  is  careful  to  keep  the  promotion  and evaluation issues separated, and to focus on the evaluation only.  The simple willingness by evaluators  to  upgrade,  rewrite,  or  void  an  evaluation  is  not  a  valid  basis  for  doing so.    EXAMPLE:    Requests  to  add  optional  statements  (such  as  DE/PME,  assignment/ job/command "push" recommendation, add an omitted award or stratification) to an evaluation or PRF will normally not form the basis for a successful appeal.  As these statements are not mandatory for inclusion, their omission does not make the evaluation inaccurate.  You must prove the evaluation is erroneous or unjust based on its content. A2.5.2.  Ratings and Comments Inconsistent with Prior or Subsequent Evaluations.  Ratings are not erroneous or unjust because they are inconsistent with other ratings you have received.  An evaluation documents performance during a specific period and reflects your performance, conduct, and potential at that time, in that position.  An ability to function well in one position 310 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 at a given time may change in another job at another time.  Sometimes an individual can stay in the same job and a change in supervisors will produce a change in performance standards which, depending on how well the individual adapts, could cause a marked change in the next evaluation.  The Board will not approve requests to void evaluations simply because they are inconsistent with other evaluation evaluations. A2.5.3.  Comments  Inconsistent  with  Assigned  Ratings.    Retrospective  views  of  facts  and circumstances,  months  or  even  years  after  the  evaluation  was  written,  will  usually  not overcome the Board's presumption that the initial assessment remains valid.  You are unlikely to convince the Board simply by comparing an evaluator's comments and ratings. A2.5.4.  Deflationary  Rating  Programs.    Evaluators  must  accurately  assess  personnel  and control  inflation.    Therefore,  to  appeal  on  this  basis,  you  must  clearly  establish  that  the evaluator did not use the Air Force evaluation policy in effect at the time and, as a result, you were not rated fairly in comparison to your peers evaluated at the same time. A2.5.5.  Personality  Conflict.    In  worker-supervisor  relationships,  some  disagreements  are likely to occur since a worker must abide by a supervisor's policies and decisions.  Personnel who do not perform at expected standards or require close supervision may believe that an evaluator is personally biased; however, the conflict generated by this personal attention is usually  professional  rather  than  personal.    To  convince  the  Board  that  an  evaluator  was unfavorably biased, you must cite specific examples of the conflict or bias.  Provide firsthand evidence that clearly shows how the conflict prevented the evaluator from preparing a fair and accurate evaluation.  If other evaluators support an appeal because they were unaware of a conflict at the time, they should provide specific information (and cite their sources) which leads them to believe the evaluation is not an objective assessment. A2.5.6.  Coercion by Superiors.  The Board seriously and carefully evaluates any allegation of coercion by superiors.  The Air Force requires endorsers, reviewers, and commanders to review evaluations  for  quality  and  to  control  inflationary  tendencies.    These  officials  must  reject poorly prepared evaluations and downgrade or reject inflated evaluations.  Evaluators who change their evaluations after talking with a superior have not necessarily been coerced.  Clear evidence must exist proving that the superior violated the evaluator's rating rights.  Supporting statements must identify the person who did the coercing, list the specific threats that were made, and identify any witnesses who can corroborate the incident. A2.5.7.  Undue Emphasis on Isolated Incidents.  Although you may feel that evaluators have over stressed an isolated incident or a short period of substandard performance or conduct, the evaluators are obliged to consider such incidents, their significance, and the frequency with which they occurred in assessing performance and potential.  Only the evaluators know how much an incident influenced the evaluation; therefore, the opinions of individuals outside the rating  chain  are  not  relevant.    Retrospective  statements  from  evaluators  prepared  several months (or even years) after the incident or following a period of improved performance do not carry as much weight as assessments made when the facts and circumstances were fresh in their minds. To convince the Board, evaluators must provide specific information about the incident and why they now believe it was overly emphasized.  AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 311 A2.5.8.  Lack  of  Counseling  or  Feedback.  Only  the  rater  can  confirm  if  counseling  was provided.    While  current  Air  Force  policy  requires  performance  feedback  for  personnel,  a direct correlation between information provided during feedback sessions and the assessments on evaluations does not necessarily exist.  EXAMPLE: If after a positive feedback session, an evaluator discovers serious problems, he or she must record the problems in the evaluation even when it disagrees with the previous feedback.  There may be occasions when feedback was not provided during a reporting period, or a specific issue was not addressed; the lack of counseling or feedback, by itself, is not sufficient to challenge the accuracy or validity of an evaluation.  Evaluators must confirm they did not provide counseling or feedback, and that this directly resulted in an unfair evaluation.  You must also supply specific information about the unfair evaluation so the Board can make a reasoned judgment on the appeal.  Finally, every Airman should know the existing standards for indebtedness, weight, fitness, etc.  Lack of counseling in these areas provides no valid basis for voiding an evaluation. A2.5.9.  Alleged Discrimination or Unfair Treatment.  Air Force members must report any form of discrimination to their supervisors or commander.  If you file a complaint late in a reporting period or after an evaluation closes, it may appear that you complained to create doubts about the evaluation's fairness and accuracy.  If you believe that you have been the victim of discrimination,  your best evidence is an official equal opportunity  and treatment (EOT) investigation, reviewed and validated by appropriate officials.  As an alternative, you may  use  statements  from  officials  in  the  rating  chain  or  other  credible  sources  who  have firsthand knowledge of the discrimination.  You must prove that an evaluator was biased and that the bias affected the person's objectivity to a point that a fair and accurate evaluation was impossible. A2.5.10.  Evaluation Completed on Wrong  Form.  The Board does not void an evaluation because it was completed on the wrong form.  The evaluation will either be re-accomplished or superimposed on the correct form. A2.5.11.  Administrative Issues.  The Board does not normally void evaluations because of administrative errors.  To convince the Board, you must prove that the evaluation would have been  substantially  different  without  the  error.    Normal  procedure  is  to  correct  the administrative error rather than void the evaluation. A2.5.12.  Evaluation Inconsistent with Awards or Decorations Covering the Same Reporting Period.  Citations are not specific enough to offset the comments and ratings in an evaluation.  Awards and decorations are usually submitted by members of the rating chain who are fully aware of the contested evaluation.  Therefore, an approved award or decoration alone does not challenge the accuracy of an evaluation. A2.5.13.  Personal  Opinions  and  Unsupported  Allegations.    Do  not  make  statements  you cannot support with evidence.  Your personal opinions will not convince the Board to approve your application.  Unsubstantiated conjecture about the motives of your evaluators, or how or why your evaluation turned out as it did, do not contribute to your case.  You must provide factual, specific, and substantiated information that is from credible officials and is based on firsthand observation or knowledge.  Statements or Memorandum for Records (MFRs) written by yourself on the events which you believe lead to the contested evaluation are not creditable evidence unless supported by another creditable official. 312 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 A2.5.14.  Mismarked Ratings.  The instructions governing the Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems clearly require evaluators (and no one else) to mark evaluations, and prohibit them from signing blank or unmarked forms.  You will need statements from all evaluators who signed the evaluation.  These statements must fully explain how the error occurred and why the evaluators did not notice the error when they signed the evaluation. Sometimes the typist or administrative section is blamed for such errors, in which case a statement from them can help.  If the unit has a policy which requires raters to sign blank forms, or prohibits them from marking their ratings, a statement from the unit commander (or other person that imposed and enforced the policy) will be needed.  The Board usually directs the evaluation be corrected or re-accomplished rather than voided. A2.5.15.  Evaluation Not Endorsed by Mandatory Endorser.  An evaluation not endorsed at the  required  level  is  normally  corrected  instead  of  voided.    Identify  the  proper  mandatory endorser and obtain the omitted endorsement.  You can have the evaluation re-accomplished or have the endorsement placed in the correct section of a blank form and signed.  Include statements from the evaluators explaining the error. A2.5.16.  Lack of Observation.  Applications based on the fact that you and your evaluators were geographically separated, working on a different shift, or your evaluators were new to the job, require conclusive documentation showing they had no valid basis on which to assess performance.  Many individuals have to perform duties without the benefit of direct daily supervision; therefore, separation alone is not a good argument.  Finally, endorsing officials have to be in the rating chain only on or after the evaluation's close-out. A2.5.17.  Evaluation Not Written by Designated Rater.  The Air Force does not require the designated  rater  to  be  your  immediate  supervisor.    Inaccurate  designations  and  failures  to change raters can occur when personnel are reassigned, work centers reorganized, functional areas or units realigned, etc.  To prove  your case,  you will need statements from both the individuals who signed the evaluation and from the individuals who believe they should have written  the  evaluation.    They  should  cite  the  from  and  thru  dates  of  their  supervision  and explain what happened.  The “erroneous” evaluator must clearly explain why he or she wrote and signed the evaluation when they were not the rater.  Likewise the “correct” evaluator must explain why he or she did not write the evaluation even though they were supposed to.  Also helpful is a statement from the unit commander, if possible, providing specific information. A2.5.18.  Insufficient Supervision.  To appeal based on insufficient supervision, you need: A2.5.18.1.  Computer-generated  products  or  other  documents  that  substantiate  when supervision began and ended. A2.5.18.2.  Understand  that  OJT  records,  feedback  notices,  and  performance  feedback worksheets do not document the date supervision began.  They document only that an OJT entry was made, a feedback notice produced, or a feedback session took place. A2.5.18.3.  Often, evaluators feel that days of supervision minimums are not sufficient time to evaluate a ratee.  However, Air Force standards establish that the minimum days are adequate to be able to provide a valid assessment.  This standard applies Air Force-wide and appeals based on the rater’s belief that minimums are not enough time are not approved. AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 313 A2.5.19.  Memorandum of Mitigation.  You can get a memorandum of mitigation to attach to an evaluation from an evaluator who signed the original evaluation or from someone in the rating chain at the time of the original evaluation.  The memorandum must present information that was not known at the time of the evaluation's preparation and must explain the comments or ratings.  You cannot  use a memorandum of mitigation simply to add information to an evaluation when there was not enough space on the original evaluation to include it.  The memorandum must be no more than a single, typed page.  It must not discuss promotion status or potential or any other subject or material if this information was not allowed in the original evaluation.  Do not emphasize comments by using bold type, underlines, unusual fonts, etc. A2.5.20.  Lack of Training.  You will require supporting statements from rating chain officials who can give specific information about the training problem and its impact on the evaluation.  Since failing to provide training and failing to document training are different problems, OJT records, reviews of OJT records, and OJT inspection reports do not prove training was not conducted, only that training was not documented. A2.5.21.  Forged  Signature.    Allegations  of  a  forged  signature  on  an  evaluation  must  be confirmed  by  a  notarized  statement  from  the  actual  evaluator  or  by  the  results  of  an investigation. A2.5.22.  Fitness:  If you are requesting a change pertaining to the fitness area, you must justify why the fitness area is incorrect and provide relevant, supporting documents (i.e., past fitness history, profiles, medical authority input, etc.).  Any request without supporting documents will be returned or not favorably considered. A2.5.23.  Re-accomplishing  an  evaluation.    If  you  are  requesting  an  evaluation  be  re- accomplished, you must furnish a substitute evaluation in your appeal case.  The substitute evaluation must: A2.5.23.1.  Be signed by all the evaluators who signed the original evaluation (this includes the commander on EPRs).  If an evaluator cannot be located, you must submit evidence of all  attempts  to  locate  the  missing  evaluator  (i.e.  certified  mail  receipt,  emails,  postal service,  etc).    After  all  attempts  have  been  exhausted,  contact  HQ  AFPC/DP2SPE  for guidance. A2.5.23.2.  Be on the correct form not only for your grade, but also for the time the original evaluation  was  written.    EXAMPLE:    If  you  are  re-accomplishing  a  Promotion Recommendation Form (PRF) for a CY93 Board, the Aug 88 version of the AF Form 709 must be used, not the Jun 95 edition of the form.  Similarly, if you are re-accomplishing an EPR which has a close-out date of Jan 95, the substitute must be on the Jan 93 edition of the AF Form 910/911, not the Jun 95 version.      314 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 A2.6.  Special Information on Appealing AF Form 709, Promotion Recommendation Form (PRF).  (NOTE: The MLR process does not apply to the ResAF). A2.6.1.  General Information.  A material error in the PRF itself; substantive changes to the record of performance used to assess your performance-based potential; or, a material error in the PRF preparation process, may justify changes to  your PRF.  Normally, comments and recommendations  are  required  from  the  senior  rater  who  signed  the  PRF  and  the  MLR President  who  reviewed  it.    If  the  SR  is  deceased  or  retired  and  not  available,  the  MLR president who originally reviewed the PRF can act instead.  When the senior rater is available but  the  original  MLR  President  is  deceased  or  retired  and  not  available,  the  current  MLR President can act in his or her place.  (NOTE:  An evaluator is considered not available when they are incapacitated or, after reasonable efforts, cannot be located or contacted.  You should include in your application documentation that shows when and how you attempted to contact an evaluator, such as certified mail receipts, and so forth.  An evaluator will not be substituted or bypassed simply because they will not support an application, or because you do not believe you will have time to locate or contact them prior to a specific date or event). A2.6.1.1.  Substantive additions, deletions, changes, or corrections to an officer's record of performance include voiding a referral or negative evaluation; adding a previously missing OPR  or  TR;  removing  a  negative  endorsement  or  adding  a  positive  one;  replacing  an evaluation with a substantially different one, and so on.  The change must, in effect, remove negative information from an officer’s record or add positive information which was not previously  known.    A  simple  administrative  change  to  an  evaluation  rarely  meets  this criteria. A2.6.1.2.  SR and MLR  Presidents who provide  comments and recommendations must carefully consider what, if any, impact the correction or change may have had on the final PRF content, rating, or the preparation process.  They will need to explain the change to the record of performance, its impact on the PRF, and how the requested PRF action relates to the changed record of performance.  Appeals based on errors in the preparation process must  also  be  fully  explained  and  substantiated.    SRs  must  weigh  the  impact  of  the processing error on the PRF and explain how the error justifies the requested PRF change. A2.6.1.3.  The  ML  that  initially  processed  the  PRF  can  best  route  PRF  appeals  to  the appropriate MLR President.  Since MLs may have different procedures for processing PRF appeals, contact the appropriate one for instructions.  If the ML no longer exists, contact HQ AFPC/DP2SPE for instructions. A2.6.2.  PRF Appeal Requirements.  It is impossible to list exact instructions for each type of appeal; so, if necessary, contact HQ AFPC/DP2SPE or ARPC/PB for guidance on appeals not covered in this instruction.  The following list describes minimum required documentation for the Board to reach a fair and equitable decision on your appeal: A2.6.2.1.  Voiding a PRF.  You must provide substantial evidence proving the PRF does not contain a valid promotion potential assessment, and that it is not possible to correct the form. A2.6.2.2.  Changing the (Promotion Recommendation) requires the concurrence of both the SR and MLR President.  The PRF should “provide key performance factors from the officer’s entire career.”  Obviously, the space on the form is limited and it is not usually AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 315 possible  to  describe  every  achievement  in  an  officer’s  career.    The  SR  bears  the responsibility of selecting what to include in the PRF, and what to leave out; which portions of  the  officer’s  career  to  concentrate  on,  and  which  portions  to  have  supported  by  the record.  While he or she may request inputs from subordinate commanders, to do so is not mandatory.  To change the promotion recommendation, the SR will need to demonstrate there was a material error in the PRF; a material error in the record of performance which substantially impacted the content of the PRF; or, a material error in the process by which the  PRF  was  crafted.    In  all  instances,  the  requested  change  to  the  promotion recommendation  must  be  related  to  the  documented  error.    Appeals  to  rewrite  the promotion  recommendation  simply  to  include  different,  but  previously  known  or documented accomplishments will not be approved. A2.6.2.3.  Changing the overall promotion recommendation to a "promote" rating requires the concurrence of both the SR and MLR President.  The SR provides detailed information about  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  requested  change  and  the  rationale  for  the correction.  The MLR President reviews the request and recommends for or against the change.  The SR and MLR President should not support a requested change to the PRF unless a material error exists. A2.6.2.4.  Changing the overall promotion recommendation to a "DP” rating must be fully justified and requires the concurrence of both the SR and MLR President.  In the promotion process, DP ratings are strictly controlled, and awarded after a competitive review of the SR’s pool of eligibles identifies the top officers.  The MLR validates the SR’s decision and conducts  a  similar  competitive  review  in  awarding  carry-over  or  aggregate  DPs.    In determining whether to seek award of a DP via an appeal, SRs and MLR Presidents must, as much as possible, replicate the original competitive process.  SRs and MLRs needing assistance in identifying their original pool of eligibles should contact HQ AFPC/DP2SPE, 550 C Street West, Suite 7, Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph TX 78150-4709 to obtain a MEL and copies of records of performance which may be needed for the board in question.  The SR details the circumstances surrounding the requested change, the rationale for the correction, and the method (an earned DP allocation, aggregation or carry-over) by which the DP rating would have been awarded originally.  As with other PRF appeals, there must be a material error in the PRF, record of performance, or process, and it must be shown how that error resulted in an erroneous rating.  In addition: A2.6.2.4.1.  When the SR identifies an "earned DP allocation," he or she certifies that the applicant's corrected record would have been awarded a DP rating in competition with  the  SR’s  original  pool  of  eligibles.    After  reviewing  the  circumstances  of  the appeal  and  the  applicant's  record,  the  MLR  President  recommends  whether  the  DP rating should be confirmed. A2.6.2.4.2.  If the SR believes a DP rating would have been awarded under aggregation or carry-over, the MLR President reviews the request, the circumstances surrounding the error, and its impact on the strength of the applicant’s record.  The MLR President, after a competitive review (see para 8.7), determines if the corrected record would have been  sufficiently  strong  to  have  earned  a  DP  at  the  original  MLR,  and  makes  the appropriate recommendation. 316 AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 A2.6.3.  Changing PRFs reviewed by a USAF Student Evaluation Board or a USAF Evaluation Board for Officers in Competitive Categories Other Than Line of the Air Force.  The same requirements listed above apply except after meeting the SR’s requirement, forward the appeal to HQ AFPC/DP2SPE for processing. HQ AFPC/DP2SPE serves as the ML for these boards and will secure a recommendation from the MLR President. A2.6.4.  Board Review.  The Board is extremely careful in considering appeals of PRFs.  The decision  whether  or  not  to  grant  or  deny  the  appeal  rests  with  the  Board,  which  has  the independent responsibility to make the determination.  SR, MLR President, and other inputs and/or recommendations are factors which the Board will consider in making its determination.  It is not bound by any of the recommendations.  The Board determines the weight it will give to all such inputs. A2.7.  Special Information on Appealing AF Form 3538, Retention Recommendation Form (RRF). A2.7.1.  The Board carefully evaluates RRF appeals and obtaining the support  outlined below does not guarantee approval, but is the minimum required for the Board to reach a fair and equitable decision. A2.7.2.  Voiding an RRF.  Evidence requirements are similar to evidence requirements for voiding  other  evaluation  types.    You  must  provide  substantiating  evidence  that  the  form contains an unjust or inaccurate assessment of your potential for continued service. A2.7.3.  To change the narrative comments, or the retention recommendation, you must have the support of the evaluators who signed the form.  The first evaluator is generally the primary person to substantiate the form is inaccurate.  He or she details the circumstances surrounding the  error  and  explains  why  it  should  be  corrected.    The  second  evaluator  reviews  the circumstances  and  provides  a  recommendation.    On  occasion,  the  same  person  may  be responsible for the first and second evaluators' portions of the form.  If major changes are needed, fill out a new form and attach it to the request for correction.  AFI36-2406  8 NOVEMBER  2016 317 Attachment 3 NON-RATED PERIOD MEMORANDUM EXAMPLE (use appropriate organization letterhead)  (Attachment XX) Non-rated Period(s) Memorandum DATE MEMORANDUM FOR XX SQ/CC  FROM:  RANK, LAST NAME, FIRST NAME, MI OF REQUESTING MEMBER (LAST 4 of SSN) SUBJECT:  Non-rated Period(s) on (Enlisted/Officer) Performance Report 1.
