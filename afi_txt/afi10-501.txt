A  PAD  is  a  Headquarters  Air  Force  (HAF)  document  that provides  strategic  level  guidance  to  HAF  staff  and  Major  Command  (MAJCOM)  commanders about  how  to  achieve  SecAF  and  CSAF-directed  objectives.    PADs  require  detailed,  cross-functional  and/or  cross-MAJCOM  planning  and  guidance  to  implement  major  Air  Force programs  aligned  with  national,  joint,  or  service  initiatives.    A  PAD  has  a  broad  scope  that typically affects multiple HAF functional areas, MAJCOMs, or other organizations and consists of a Basic Plan and supporting functional staff annexes.  For example, AF/A2 and its effort used a  PAD  to  re-designate  the  Air  Force  Intelligence,  Surveillance,  and  Reconnaissance  Agency from  a  Field  Operating  Agency  (FOA)  to  a  Numbered  Air  Force  (NAF)  under  Air  Combat Command (ACC). 1.2.  Program  Guidance  Letter.  A  PGL  is  a  HAF  document  that  provides  strategic  level guidance  to  MAJCOM  commanders  and  HAF  staff  about  how  to  achieve  SecAF  and  CSAF-directed  objectives.    PGLs  are  used  when  SecAF/CSAF  direction  does  not  require  detailed, cross-functional and/or cross-MAJCOM planning requirements of a PAD.  A PGL has a narrow scope that typically  affects  a single HAF functional  area,  for  example AF/A1 and  its oversight for Air Education and Training Command (AETC) and/or Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC).  A PGL is never subsidiary to a PAD and will not be used to implement PAD directives. 1.3.  Programming  Plan.  PPlans  are  detailed  planning  documents  used  to  implement  PADs, PGLs, or individual MAJCOM/Direct Reporting Unit (DRU)/FOA initiatives.  This document is written  below  HQ  USAF-level  and  is  used  to  initiate  and  record  major  actions.    A  PPlan  is  a directive,  coordinated  document,  consisting  of  a  Basic  Plan  and  supporting  functional  staff annexes,  which  defines  required  actions,  and  outlines  the  responsibilities for  achieving  a  given program  objective.    The  primary  types  of  actions  for  which  PPlans  are  developed  include  unit activations and inactivations and realignments involving the physical move of people or assets.  Some major actions, such as transferring a function and/or assets from one command to another, require  an  inter-MAJCOM  or  interagency  PPlan  with  one  command  being  OPR  and  the  others being OCR. 1.4.  Programming  Message.  A  PMsg  may  be  used  by  a  MAJCOM/DRU/FOA  in  lieu  of  a PPlan  when  less  comprehensive  documentation  will  suffice  to  implement  a  program  objective.  For example, a PMsg is often utilized when limited functional involvement is required to execute the  action.    A  PMsg  may  also  be  used  as  an  interim  measure  to  establish  the  overall  goal  and provide  basic  guidance  pertaining  to  a  major  program  action  while  more  comprehensive documentation  is  being  developed.    Some  major  actions  require  an  inter-MAJCOM  or interagency PMsg with one command being OPR and the others being OCR.   6  AFI10-501  8 APRIL 2015 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Development/Management Tools. 3.1.1.  There  are  several  project  management  tools  available  to  effectively  assist  in developing  and  managing  PADs,  PGLs,  PPlans,  and  PMsgs.    Work  Breakdown  Structure (WBS)  and  Integrated  Master  Schedule  (IMS)  are  project  management  tools  which  are designed  to  successfully  plan,  organize,  and  accomplish  initiatives.    Additionally,  the Doctrine,  Organization,  Training,  Materiel,  Leadership  &  Education,  Personnel,  Facilities and  Policy  (DOTMLPF-P)  construct  can  be  utilized  during  WBS  and  IMS  development  to facilitate  the  decomposition  of  tasks  critical  to  implementing  the  initiative.    Examples  are located  within the  PAD/PGL  Portfolio  Management  site  https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afdbt/PAD-PGL_Portfolio/default.aspx template  at the  PAD 3.1.2.  DOTMLPF-P is an acronym pertaining to the eight possible material and non-materiel elements  involved  in  resolving  capability  gaps  used  for  assessing  current  capabilities, identifying  gaps  in  the  context  of  strategic  direction,  and  managing  change  to  assist  in defining the range in scope and the extent of guidance needed to accomplish the effort. 3.1.3.  WBS  is  a  hierarchical  and  incremental  decomposition  of  the  project  into  phases, deliverables, and work packages.  It is  a tree structure, which shows a subdivision of effort required to achieve an objective; for example a program, project, and contract.  In a project, the WBS is developed by starting with the end objective and successively subdividing it into manageable  components  in  terms  of  size,  duration,  and  responsibility  (e.g.,  systems, subsystems,  components,  tasks,  subtasks,  and  work  packages)  which  include  all  steps necessary to achieve the objective. 3.1.4.  Defining  and  publishing  an  IMS  provides  an  integrated,  detailed,  and  standardized schedule  for  the  OPR  to  communicate  what  needs  to  be  accomplished  to  all  of  the  team members,  the  time  required,  and  the  interaction  between  project  elements.    The  IMS effectively illustrates progress, interrelationships, and dependencies thereby helping to enable the effective execution of activities towards project success. 3.2.  Mandatory Requirements for Management Tools. 3.2.1.  PAD OPRs will use the DOTMLPF-P methodology during development of the WBS and IMS.  The WBS and IMS that support all PAD initiatives will be documented in the PAD Functional Annex Y.   10  AFI10-501  8 APRIL 2015 Chapter 4 PAD LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE 4.1.  Initiate Phase. Figure 4.1.  PAD Initiate Phase  4.1.1.  SecAF, CSAF, or their designee will direct  the initiation of a PAD to  achieve stated objectives and assign a specific HAF Functional as PAD OPR, based on the subject matter. 4.1.2.  The  PAD  OPR  shall  request  a  PAD  number  for  identification  and  routing  purposes from  the  PAD/PGL  Portfolio  Manager.    A  PAD  initiation  request  is  required  for  a  PAD number assignment.  A  PAD initiation request  shall include, at  a minimum,  OPR assigned, proposed  PAD  title,  initial  scope,  background,  authority/tasked  by,  PPlan  and/or  PMsg requirements, programming (manpower and budget) considerations, and strategic milestones.  Initiation  request  template  can  be  found  on  the  PAD/PGL  Portfolio  Management  site (https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afdbt/PAD-PGL_Portfolio/default.aspx).    The  request  will  be sent  to  the PAD/PGL PfM at:   usaf.pentagon.saf-usm.mbx.usmx-workflow@mail.mil for review. 4.1.2.1.  Programming (manpower and budget) considerations will be coordinated, by the PAD  OPR,  through  SAF/FMPE  (budgeting/programming)  and  AF/A1M  (manpower) offices that  may  affect  PAD implementation and future year resources availability. identify  potential  requirements  and  concerns to 4.1.2.2.  Strategic milestones shall include, at a minimum, completion date for the Basic Plan, completion date for the functional annexes, and other strategic milestones critical to achieving  PAD  implementation  such  as:    capabilities  that  the  initiative  will  implement, initial operational capability (IOC), and full operational capability (FOC). 4.1.2.3.  The request will be subject to approval by the PAD/PGL PfM.  Once approved by  the  PAD/PGL  PfM,  the  PAD/PGL  PfM  will  assign  a  PAD  number.    PAD  numbers shall  be  assigned  sequentially  within  each  fiscal  year  with  “D”  at  the  beginning  of  the sequence to designate PADs (e.g., D14-01, D14-02). AFI10-501  8 APRIL 2015   11  4.1.3.  After PAD number assignment, the PAD/PGL PfM shall inform the EPIC of the PAD initiation during the next status update. 4.1.4.  The PAD OPR will begin the process of building the PAD Basic Plan after the PAD number assignment. 4.2.  Build Phase. Figure 4.2.  PAD Build Phase  4.2.1.  The  PAD  OPR  will  develop  the  PAD  Basic  Plan.    A  template  is  available  at  the PAD/PGL (https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afdbt/PAD-PGL_Portfolio/default.aspx). Portfolio  Management site 4.2.1.1.  The  Basic  Plan  shall  include,  at  a  minimum,  a  preface,  table  of  contents  and sections  for  Purpose,  Authority/References,  Background,  Objectives,  Concept  of Employment,  Assumptions,  Guidance  (with  special  instructions),  Strategic  Milestones, Effective Date, and PAD OPR. 4.2.1.1.1.  The  Guidance  section  shall  include  at  a  minimum  the  responsibilities, special  instructions,  and  tasks  of  the  HAF  functionals  and  below  HAF-level functionals   For  example,  PPlans,  PMsgs, Memorandums of Understanding, or Organizational Change Requests. (MAJCOMs,  DRUs,  FOAs). 4.2.1.1.2.  Strategic milestones will be specific, measureable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound.    At  a  minimum,  they  will  capture  all  major  objectives  critical  to achieving  PAD  implementation  and  will  be  listed  in  chronological  order.    This  will   12  AFI10-501  8 APRIL 2015 include, but not be limited to all time-bound tasks identified in the initiation request, guidance  section,  functional  annexes  Estimated  Completion  Date  (ECD),  PAD approval  date,  individual  PPlan/PMsg  Build  Phase  ECD,  individual  PPlan/PMsg Execution Phase ECD, manpower programming changes implemented, organizational changes implemented, facility requirements identified, facility requirements sourced, strategic  basing  decided,  IOC,  and  FOC.    Strategic  milestones  will  be  used  by  the PAD OPR to assess completion progress and will be reported to the PAD/PGL PfM.  PAD  OPRs  may  be  required  to  brief  any  overdue  PAD  strategic  milestones  greater than 30-calendar days overdue to the EPIC. 4.2.2.  The PAD OPR will submit the draft PAD Basic Plan to the PAD/PGL PfM for review.  The review will encompass an ICOA initiated by the PAD/PGL PfM among the active PAD and  PGL  OPRs.    The  ICOA  will  be  conducted  to  identify  conflicting  guidance  and/or unintended  consequences  between  active  PADs/PGLs  and  the  draft  Basic  Plan.    The PAD/PGL PfM will coordinate adjudication of the ICOA results through the draft PAD OPR.  The  PAD/PGL  PfM  will  certify  the  adjudicated  ICOA  results  and  assign  the  PAD  final signature  authority  (USecAF  or  VCSAF  under  consultation  with  CSAF  and  SecAF  as required). 4.2.3.

Functional annexes will be initiated no later than (NLT) 30-calendar days from the  ICOA  certification  of  the  Basic  Plan  and  should  be  completed  within  90-calendar days  from  the  ICOA  certification  date.    The  PAD  OPR  will  be  required  to  brief  any overdue annexes to the EPIC. 4.2.3.2.  All  functional  annexes  are  required  as  part  of  the  PAD  and  shall  include,  at  a minimum,  sections  for  Purpose,  References,  Objectives,  Assumptions,  Guidance,  Time Phased  Actions  critical  to  the  annex,  and  annex  OCR/POC  (name/office/number).    If  a PAD OCR determines that a functional annex is not required for a particular effort, then a justification paragraph will be annotated, by the OCR, at the top of the annex. 4.2.3.3.  The  PAD  OPR  will  develop  a  Strategic  Communications  Plan  as  a  functional annex (Functional  Annex V).   The Strategic Communications Plan defines the project’s structure  and  methods  of  information  collection,  screening,  formatting,  and  distribution of  information.    The  overall  objective  of  the  Strategic  Communications  Plan  is  to promote the success of a project by meeting the information needs of project stakeholders and outline the goals of the communications efforts to reach and inform each group.  The Strategic Communications Plan will identify the means and frequency that the PAD OPR will openly notify/communicate to initiative stakeholders (e.g., Congress, DoD, affected Air  Force  organizations  and  their  people,  ARC  leadership,  State/Local  leaders).    The Strategic  Communications  Plan  will  include  at  a  minimum  Purpose,  Objective, Assumptions/Requirements,  PAD  OPR  Governance  Structure  (including  organizational chart), Key Messages, Stakeholder Identification, and Communication Actions Matrix. 4.2.3.3.1.  The  PAD  OPR  Governance  Structure  section  (including  organizational chart) will describe the command and control for the PAD initiative starting from the HAF  2-letter  down  to  the  action  officer(s)/SME(s).    The  PAD  OPR  relationship between  PAD  OCRs  and  PPlan/PMsg  OPRs  will  also  be  defined.    An  organization chart will be included depicting the command and control relationships. 4.2.3.3.2.  Key Messages section will identify any messages critical to the success of the PAD, gain buy-in, support PAD capabilities, and engage stakeholders (e.g., Total Force  Integration  Message).    These  key  messages  will  be  woven  into  the communications materials and events that are being scheduled as part of the Strategic Communications Plan. 4.2.3.3.3.  Communication  Actions  Matrix  section  will  define  details  regarding  the communications activities that are used during the course of the PAD lifecycle.

The PAD OPR will develop a WBS and IMS as a functional annex (Functional Annex  Y).    The  WBS  is  based  on  defining  the  products  necessary  to  deliver  the  target capabilities.    The  WBS  breaks  down  work  products  into  smaller  elements  where  each level  of is decomposed  to  the  level  where  individual  deliverables  can  be  executed  independently and  still  aggregate  to  generate  the  end  product,  and  creates  a  product-oriented  WBS  to feed the activity-based IMS that is essential for establishing a reliable schedule baseline and program plan.  A WBS shall include, at a minimum, sections for WBS number, WBS level,  deliverable  items,  OPR,  and  OCR.    A  WBS  template  (Functional  Annex  Y)  is located  within  the  PAD  template  at  the  PAD/PGL  Portfolio  Management  site (https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afdbt/PAD-PGL_Portfolio/default.aspx). increasingly  detailed  work  product  definition, 4.2.3.4.1.  The PAD OPR will develop an IMS as part of Functional Annex Y.  The WBS  provides  the  basic  structure  for  an  IMS  which  effectively  illustrates  progress, interrelationships,  and  dependencies  across  the  entire  PAD  project  to  include  the functional annexes.  An IMS shall include, at a minimum, sections for IMS number, schedule  ID, activity/task, start date, finish date, OPR, and OCR.  An IMS template (Functional Annex Y) is located within the PAD template at the PAD/PGL Portfolio Management site (https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afdbt/PAD-PGL_Portfolio/default.aspx). 4.2.3.4.2.  The completed IMS will include all activities to deliver products identified in  the  WBS,  provide  a  logically  sequenced  schedule  of  all  activities  to  deliver  a capability, link IMS activities to the strategic milestones, contain activities that have predecessor  and  successor  tasks,  and  be  baselined  and  placed  under  configuration management.    The  Strategic  Communications  Plan  (Functional  Annex  V)  will  be integrated into the IMS. Figure 4.3.  IMS Example 4.2.4.  The PAD OPR will submit the draft PAD Basic Plan and all functional annexes to the PAD/PGL PfM for review.  Following the PAD/PGL PfM outcome of the review, the PAD OPR shall staff the draft PAD Basic Plan and all functional annexes for coordination through HAF 3-letter and MAJCOM/CVs, as applicable.  Once all 3-letter/MAJCOM/CV comments are adjudicated, the PAD OPR will staff the updated draft PAD Basic Plan and all functional  AFI10-501  8 APRIL 2015   15  annexes  for  coordination  through  HAF  2-letter  offices.    Once  2-letter  comments  are adjudicated,  the  PAD  OPR  will  submit  the  final  PAD  to  the  PAD/PGL  PfM  for  review.  Pending  PAD/PGL  PfM  approval,  the  PAD  OPR  shall  staff  the  fully  coordinated  PAD  to either  USecAF  or  VCSAF  under  consultation  with  CSAF  and  SecAF  as  required  for signature  and  final  approval.    The  signed  PAD  will  be  posted  by  the  PAD  OPR  to  the PAD/PGL (https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afdbt/PAD-PGL_Portfolio/default.aspx). Portfolio  Management site 4.3.  Execution Phase. Figure 4.4.  PAD Execution Phase  4.3.1.  The  PAD  OPR  will  lead  all  phases  of  the  PAD  implementation  effort.    This  will include, but not be limited to directing and monitoring PAD OCRs and PPlan/PMsg OPRs in implementing  all  time-phased  actions.    The  PAD  OPR  will  assign  a  number  to  supporting PPlans  or  PMsgs.    PPlan  numbers  shall  be  based  on  the  parent  PAD  and  assigned sequentially within each fiscal year with the name of the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA and “DN” as the  prefix  of  the  number  sequence.    For  example,  a  PAD  is  assigned  “D15-01”  and  AETC will develop a supporting PPlan.  In this example, the PAD OPR will assign “AETC DN15-01” to AETC.  PMsgs shall be assigned sequentially within each fiscal year with the name of the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA and “DG” as the prefix of the number sequence.  For example, a PAD is assigned “D15-01” and ACC will develop a supporting PMsg. In this example, PAD OPR will assign “ACC DG15-01” to ACC. Table 4.2.

The PAD OPR will provide monthly (or as directed) status updates, reporting progress of PAD events outlined in the Strategic Milestones, Functional Annex Time Phased Actions, and  IMS  (Functional  Annex  Y)  to  the  PAD/PGL  PfM.    The  PAD  OPR  will  be  required  to brief  to  the  EPIC  any  of  the  following  events:    any  30-calendar  day  overdue  PAD  events   16  AFI10-501  8 APRIL 2015 outlined in the  aforementioned items,  the PAD is at  risk of not achieving  IOC/FOC, or the PAD is overcome by events. 4.3.3.  The PAD OPR may request formal change to an approved PAD, as necessary, in order to  accommodate  changes  in  SecAF  or  CSAF  guidance,  when  it  becomes  clear  that accomplishment of specific PAD objectives is not achievable, or as the PAD OPR otherwise deems appropriate.  A PAD change request shall include, at a minimum, OPR assigned, PAD title, initial scope, change request justification, PPlan and/or PMsg detail, and status of time-phased  actions.    Change  request  template  can  be  found  on  the  PAD/PGL  Portfolio Management (https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afdbt/PAD-PGL_Portfolio/default.aspx).

A proposed PAD change shall be documented in  a  redraft of the existing PAD (with changes annotated, as appropriate, within the document) or, if changes are minimal, in Memorandum for Record format.  The PAD OPR will also take into consideration the impact on the original WBS and IMS and shall update both documents accordingly. 4.3.3.2.  The PAD OPR shall submit the proposed PAD change to the PAD/PGL PfM for an  ICOA  by  the  active  PAD/PGL  OPRs  to  readdress  potential  conflicting  guidance  or unintended consequences.  The PAD/PGL PfM will coordinate adjudication of the ICOA results through the PAD OPR.  Based on the scope of the change, the PAD/PGL PfM will recommend  additional  staffing  coordination  with  the  HAF  and  MAJCOMs,  as appropriate.    Pending  PAD/PGL  PfM  recommendation,  the  PAD  OPR  shall  staff  the proposed PAD change to USecAF or VCSAF, under consultation with CSAF and SecAF as  required,  for  signature.

Closure Phase. AFI10-501  8 APRIL 2015   17  Figure 4.5.  PAD Closure Phase 4.4.1.  The  PAD  OPR  initiates  the  closure  of  a  PAD  once  it  is  determined  that  the  PAD  is complete  (i.e.,  all  tasks  are  accomplished  and  all  objectives  are  met),  or  completion  is  not possible due to changes in guidance, conditions, or other factors (e.g., the PAD is overcome by events).  4.4.2.  The PAD OPR shall document and submit the closure request to the PAD/PGL PfM.  A  PAD  closure  request  shall  include,  at  a  minimum,  OPR  assigned,  PAD  title,  closure justification,  and  a  final  status  of  Strategic  Milestones  in  the  Basic  Plan.    Closure  request template site (https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afdbt/PAD-PGL_Portfolio/default.aspx).

The PAD/PGL PfM shall review the PAD closure recommendation and determine if an ICOA is needed.  An ICOA for a PAD closure recommendation is not needed if all tasks and objectives are met.  If the closure recommendation is a result of the PAD being no longer needed  due  to  changes  in  SecAF  or  CSAF  guidance,  or  is  overcome  by  events,  then  the PAD/PGL  PfM  shall  conduct  an  ICOA  to  determine  and  resolve  any  unintended consequences  between  the  active  PADs/PGLs  and  the  PAD  closure  recommendation.    The PAD/PGL PfM will coordinate adjudication of the ICOA results through the PAD OPR.  The PAD/PGL PfM will certify the adjudicated ICOA results and direct the PAD OPR to initiate the closure memorandum. 4.4.4.  The closure memorandum will summarize the closure recommendation.  It will be co-signed by the PAD OPR (the responsible HAF 2-letter) and the PAD/PGL PfM. 4.4.4.1.  If  all  tasks  and  objectives  in  the  PAD  effort  are  complete,  the  signing  of  the closure memorandum will signify the official closure of the PAD.   18  AFI10-501  8 APRIL 2015 4.4.4.2.  If  the  PAD  closure  recommendation  is  based  on  changes  in  SecAF  or  CSAF guidance, or is overcome by events, then the closure memorandum will be reviewed by the EPIC. 4.4.4.2.1.  In the case of a signed PAD, upon EPIC review, the closure memorandum will be staffed by the PAD OPR to  the original  signatory  authority  for  final  closure approval or as recommended by the EPIC. 4.4.4.2.2.  If  the  PAD  was  not  signed,  upon  EPIC  review,  the  closure  memorandum will signify the official closure of the PAD or as recommended by the EPIC. 4.4.5.  After  the  approval  of  PAD  closure,  the  PAD  OPR  will  notify  all  subordinate  PAD OCRs and PPlan/PMsg OPRs of the PAD closure. The PAD OPR will post the entire PAD effort in a single consolidated Portable Document Format (PDF) to the PAD/PGL Portfolio Management (https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afdbt/PAD-PGL_Portfolio/default.aspx).  The  consolidated  PDF  will  be  a  lifecycle  document  and  will  include,  in  this  order:    the closure memorandum, basic plan, functional annexes, and supporting PPlans/PMsgs. site 4.4.6.  After  PAD  closure,  the  OPR  may  compile  an  After  Action  Report  (AAR)  using  AF Form  4330  to  capture  Lessons  Learned  and  upload  AAR  to  the  Air  Force  Joint  Lessons Learned at https://www.jllis.mil/apps.

In the case of a signed PGL, upon EPIC review, the closure memorandum will  be  staffed  by  the  PGL  OPR  to  the  original  signatory  authority  for  final  closure approval or as recommended by the EPIC. 5.4.4.2.2.  If  the  PGL  was  not  signed,  upon  EPIC  review,  the  closure  memorandum will signify the official closure of the PGL or as recommended by the EPIC. 5.4.5.  After  the  approval  of  PGL  closure,  the  PGL  OPR  will  notify  all  subordinate  PGL OCRs and PPlan/PMsg OPRs of the PGL closure.  The PGL OPR will post the entire PGL effort  in  a  single  consolidated  PDF  to  the  PAD/PGL  Portfolio  Management  site (https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afdbt/PAD-PGL_Portfolio/default.aspx).   The  consolidated PDF will be a lifecycle document and will include, in this order:  the closure memorandum, basic plan, functional annexes, and supporting PPlans/PMsgs. 5.4.6.

Observations to be documented are those which result in improvements in military operations.  AAR  Observations  should  describe  how  the  mission  could  be/was  improved, potential risks to mission degradation and how to mitigate those risks. Conflicting  Guidance—  A  situation  where  the  simultaneous  implementation  of  multiple PAD/PGLs  unintentionally  creates  conflicts  in  doctrine,  guidance  or  use  of  resources.  Conflicting guidance can occur when a shift in doctrine occurs and PAD/PGLs are not changed to  reflect  the  doctrine  change.    Resource  conflicts  generally  occur  within  the  same  functional community or core function and occur when the implementation of multiple PAD/PGLs exceed available resources. Program Action Directive (PAD)— A PAD is a formal HAF-level planning document used to accomplish major SecAF or CSAF approved initiatives such as the reorganization or formation of  a  MAJCOM,  organization,  unit,  or  function.    PADs  have  well  defined  objectives,  assign specific tasks to OPRs and OCRs, and establish specific milestones.  Examples of PADs include establishing  Air  Force  Global  Strike  Command,  transforming  Air  Force  Intelligence,  and carrying out directives from the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission. PAD/PGL OPR Community— An informal group made up of principal OPRs from each active PAD and PGL.  As required by the PAD/PGL PfM, this group is  tasked to perform  PAD/PGL PfM ICOA. PAD/PGL PfM ICOA— A review activity directed by the PAD/PGL PfM and conducted by all active  PAD/PGL  OPRs  to  review  proposed  PAD/PGLs,  changes  to  existing  PAD/PGLs,  or PAD/PGL  closure  requests  to  identify  conflicting  guidance  or  unintended  consequences  that need to be resolved prior to approving the requested approval/change/closure action. Program  Guidance  Letter  (PGL)—  A  HAF-level  formal  planning  document  that  establishes direction,  assigns tasks,  and  provides  guidance  (for  example,  Morale,  Welfare,  and Recreation/Services integration or Civil Air Patrol reorganization). Programming  Message  (PMsg)—  A  PMsg  may  be  used  by  a  MAJCOM  in  lieu  of  a  PPlan when  less  comprehensive  documentation  will  suffice  to  implement  a  program  objective.    For example, a PMsg is often utilized when limited functional involvement is required to execute the action.  A PMsg may also be used as an interim measure to establish the overall goal and provide basic guidance pertaining to a major program action while more comprehensive documentation is being developed. Programming Plan (PPlan)— A formal planning document written below HQ USAF-level that helps  accomplish  and  record  major  actions.    A  PPlan  is  a  directive,  coordinated  document, consisting  of  a  Basic  Plan  and  supporting  functional  staff  annexes,  which  defines  the  actions required, and outlines the responsibilities for achieving a given program objective.  The primary types  of  actions  for  which  PPlans  are  developed  include  unit  activations  and  inactivations; realignments  involving  the  physical  move  of  people  or  assets;  base  closures;  beddown  of weapons  systems;  unit  conversions  from  one  weapons  system  to  another;  beddown  and/or integration of specialized systems or unique organizational constructs; and increases or decreases in a unit's Primary Aircraft Inventory.   36  AFI10-501  8 APRIL 2015 Unintended Consequences— A situation where PAD/PGL implementation creates unnecessary or  unanticipated  resource  commitments.    This  situation  can  occur  when  a  more  feasible  option becomes readily available after starting PAD/PGL implementation.
