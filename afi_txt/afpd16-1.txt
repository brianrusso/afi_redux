SC is a common function across military services and United States (US) Government agencies; therefore this publication adopts the DoD SC definition and incorporates standard joint terminology.  This revision also reflects the transfer of responsibility for DoDD 4500.54E, DoD Foreign Clearance Program (FCP), from AF/A3 to AF/A10 due to Headquarters Air Force (HAF) reorganization.

Overview. 1.1.1.  SC is an important tool of national security and foreign policy and an integral element of  the  United  States  Air  Force  (USAF)  mission.    It  encompasses  all  DoD  interactions  with foreign  defense  establishments  to  build  defense  relationships  that  promote  specific  US security  interests,  develop  allied  and  friendly  military  capabilities  for  self-defense  and multinational  operations,  and  provide  US  forces  with  peacetime  and  contingency  access  to host nations. 1.1.2.  US strategic guidance underscores the importance of defense relationships with allies and  partners  to  advance  defense  objectives  and  reduce  risk  to  US  military  forces.    This includes  enabling  partners  to  act  independent  of,  alongside  and/or  in  support  of  US  forces.  These relationships also  serve to prevent conflicts and aid US forces in the development of partner capability and capacity through the effective application of SC activities. 1.1.3.  DoDD  5132.03  establishes  as  DoD  policy  that  SC  activities  shall  be  planned, programmed, budgeted, and executed with the same high degree of attention and efficiency as  other  integral  DoD  activities.    DoDD  5100.01,  Functions  of  the  Department  of  Defense and Its Major Components, establishes the policy that “the Air Force is the Nation’s principal air and space force…” and charges the Department to “organize, train, equip and provide air, space,  and  cyberspace  forces  for  the  conduct  of  prompt  and  sustained  combat  operations, military  engagement,  and  security  cooperation  in  defense  of  the  Nation…”    This  policy directive establishes Air Force SC policy. 1.2.

Prepare and synchronize SC policies, objectives, and activities with the Office of the Secretary  of  Defense  (OSD),  the  Joint  Staff  (JS),  Combatant  Commands  (CCMDs),  other Military  Departments  (MILDEPs),  Defense  Security  Cooperation  Agency  (DSCA), Department  of  State  (DoS,  US  Embassy  Country  Teams),  and  other  US  agencies,  as appropriate. 1.2.2.  Produce a Security Cooperation Flight Plan (Air Force Security Cooperation Strategy) which directly supports the Air Force Strategic Master Plan.

This plan will incorporate organize, train, and equip requirements to support all SC activities.  It  will  include  a  resource  plan  for  Service  activities  in  CCMD  AORs  as  well  as  how  the activities support achievement of campaign objectives.  The CSP will be synchronized with the CCMD campaign plans. 6 AFPD16-1  12 NOVEMBER 2015 1.2.4.  Produce  an  AFI  for  SC  Activity  Managers  who  serve  as  AF  focal  points  for  SC activities.  These activities will be synchronized across the spectrum of AF operations. 1.2.4.1.  Activity Managers serve as the primary point of contact or subject matter expert for their assigned SC activity. 1.2.4.2.  Where  AF  funding  is  involved,  Activity  Managers  monitor  all  aspects  of planning,  programming,  budgeting,  and  execution  of  an  assigned  activity,  and  advocate for their activity, through Program Element Monitors (PEM). 1.2.4.3.  Activities without a dedicated Program Element Code (PEC) and a discrete PEM collaborate with SAF/IA to assist in advocating for SC resources within the AF corporate structure. 1.2.5.  Document  all  SC activities  in  the  Global  Theater  Security  Cooperation  Management Information System (G-TSCMIS). AFPD16-1  12 NOVEMBER 2015 7 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.
