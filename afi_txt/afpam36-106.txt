Upon request, an employee is permitted to review this record.An automated record is generated when certain personnel actions occur and is sent to the supervisor.The following personnel actions will generate a new Supervisor’s Employee Brief:  Appointment,Transfer, Promotion, Change to Lower Grade, Reassignment, Conversion, Merit Increase and QualityStep Increase.  Based on local requirements, briefs may be generated more frequently.  The contentsof the Supervisor’s Employee Brief follows:3.1.1. Part A will contain current personal employee data.  The supervisor will enter employee’shome address, home telephone, and necessary emergency information on each brief as soon as itis received from the civilian personnel flight by obtaining up-to-date information from theemployee.3.1.2.

Under AFI 36-401, Training and Development, the supervisor (or a higher leveloperating official) must keep a copy of the training needs and training plans that are approved for employ-ees.  This information may be part of the Supervisor’s Employee Work Folder; however, it is not main-tained on the Supervisor’s Employee Brief.5. Complaints of Indebtedness. Supervisors may retain debt complaint letters and employee’s repliesfor not more than 2 years from the date of the complaint letter.6. Leave Schedules. According to AFI 36-808, Absence and Leave, supervisors prepare a leave schedulefor their  subordinates each year.  This may be maintained in the Employee’s  Work Folder or in a centraloffice file.7.

Supervisors keep a copy of AF Form 1378, Civilian Per-sonnel Position Description, or AF Form 1003, Air Force Core Personnel Document, for each basicposition in the organization.  The file may  contain copies of organizational charts, official statements ofthe functions of the organization, and staffing authorization  documents.  Higher levels of supervision inthe overall  organization may also retain copies of these documents.  Position  descriptions or core docu-ments containing classified information  are filed as explained in AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Pro-gram Management.  Position sensitivity is maintained on the AF Form 1378 or AF Form 1003 andchanges to  position sensitivity are accomplished according to AFI 31-501 and AFI 36-107, Personneland  Position Actions.  8.

As referenced by AFI 36-506, Use and Administration of LocalCivilians in Foreign Areas During Hostilities, employees assigned to emergency-essential positions mustsign a DD Form 2365, DOD Civilian Employee Overseas Emergency- -Essential Position Agreement.The original is filed in  Supervisor’s Employee Work Folder, and a copy is sent to the  CPF.11. Records Authorized at a Higher Level. When the administrative office of a major organizationneeds to maintain a supplemental record for use in overall strength control, organizational planning, andthe efficient operation of the total organization, the following may be used:311.1. An automated listing of positions and employees for each organization.11.2. An organization chart containing this information.12. Automated Personnel Management System (APMS). APMS is not a specific data system, butrather a system which may be developed locally, outside of DCPDS.  In addition to the information con-tained in the Supervisor’s Employee Work Folder, organizations may develop local automated systems tomeet legitimate management needs.  The information contained in an APMS is outside of that containedin DCPDS and should not duplicate that information.  Any locally developed automated personnel systemmust comply with AFI 37-132, Air Force Privacy Act Program, and The Privacy Act Systems of RecordsDirectory.12.1. Requests to establish an APMS must be sent through the local CPF to the parent MAJCOMDirector of Civilian Personnel who must coordinate on any local system containing civilian personneldata before it is implemented.  This also applies to any existing system which includes or has beenchanged to include civilian personnel data.  The parent MAJCOM Director of Information Manage-ment determines whether such requests constitute a new records system that must be included in theFederal Register or whether an existing Federal Register issuance already covers the requested datasystem.13. Access to SF 66, Official Personnel Folder (OPF). The CPF maintains for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), an OPF on each serviced employee. (Duplicate folders at any other organizationlevel are not permitted.)  Operating officials, supervisors, and employees may have access to SFs 66 asfollows:13.1. Designated Officials.  Although operating officials and supervisors may refer to OPFs in con-sidering employees for promotion or other assignments, these folders are restricted by the OPM; thatis, they are not public records and are available to review for official purposes only.  Therefore, accessto information in these folders is limited locally to designated officials.13.2. Employee Access.  An employee may see any of the contents of his or her official personnelfolder except for certain examination papers, investigative reports, loyalty and security investigativeinformation, and confidential questionnaires and employment inquiries.  This restricted information iscovered in detail in Federal Personnel Manual, Chapter 294, Availability of Official Information.13.3. Handling the Folder.  Each person who uses an OPF is responsible for: (1) safeguarding theconfidential nature of the information gained from the folder; (2) not removing or adding any docu-ments; and (3) promptly returning each folder.14. Disposition and Safeguarding of The Supervisor’s Employee Work Folder .  The following pro-cedures are used in disposing of the Supervisor’s Employee Work Folder:14.1. When a supervisor leaves the organization, the Supervisor’s Employee Work Folder is retainedfor the gaining supervisor.14.2. When an employee moves to a different organization on the same base, the losing supervisorsends the complete up-to-date Employee Work Folder to the gaining supervisor.14.3. When an employee is transferred to another Air Force installation or another agency, theEmployee Work Folder is  destroyed after 60 days.414.4. When an employee is separated for any other reason other than entrance into military service oran adverse action, the supervisor destroys the Employee Work Folder after 60 days.14.5.

Unless otherwise specified in a  collective bargaining agreement, reprimands maintained in thework folder must be destroyed 2 years from date of notice of decision to reprimand, and an oraladmonishment recorded on the AF Form 971 must be deleted 2 years from the date of admonishment.14.8. These records require procedures that ensure safekeeping and storage in a manner that will pro-tect against casual access to them, that will ensure disclosure of them to Air Force officials or othersoutside of the Air Force only when appropriate, and that will not violate personal privacy.  Describingexplicitly every use of these records or describing all circumstances when they will be disclosed out-side of the Air Force is not feasible.  All supervisors and employees maintaining these records must becautioned that they are to use discretion and good judgment when asked to furnish the records; andfurnish the records only as permitted by the Privacy Act.BILLY J.
