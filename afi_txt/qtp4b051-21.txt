Needs help only on hardest parts.  Can determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task. None Training References: Additional Supporting References: CDC Reference: â¢  AFI 48-144, Drinking Water Surveillance Program, Sept 2010 â¢  USAFSAM Drinking Water Surveillance Technical Guide, 2011 â¢  Example:  Sampling, Analysis, and Monitoring (SAM) Plan, ESOH Service Center â¢  DOEHRS Water Survey Forms 4B051 Training Support Material: None Specific Techniques: Conduct hands-on training and evaluation. Criterion Objective: Notes: Given a scenario, develop a liquid/water sampling strategy successfully completing all checklist items with limited trainer assistance. A sampling strategy describes the details--âwhatâ, âwhenâ, âwhereâ, and âhowâ--of the sampling event. This training module focuses on planning the sampling event, not the tasks of identifying areas of concern that need to be sampled or sample collection. You will sample water/liquids in many diverse situations. In situations such as routine monitoring, a strategy is already defined. For example, per AFI 48-144 each installation shall have an Environmental Sampling, Analysis, and Monitoring (ESAM) Plan outlining locally developed procedures for conducting the drinking water surveillance program. These procedures should include routine monitoring, monitoring of aircraft watering points, increased monitoring for nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) agents during contingencies or heightened Force Protection Condition, and monitoring performed before placing new connections and repaired water mains or storage tanks into use. Other non-routine situations such as characterizing a potential water source at a new deployed location will require you to develop a strategy best suited for the situation. It is not possible to address all situations in this training module; therefore, it generically addresses developing a sampling strategy for water/liquids. You will have to develop skills to apply the generic steps within the operational context of the situation at hand whether it is in-garrison, deployed, or emergency response. Scenario: The trainee has been tasked to deploy to Haiti in response to the catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake which destroyed essential services and vital infrastructure to include water distribution facilities. The short-term solution was bottled water. The initial assessment team determined a primary and secondary water source. The primary source is a lake adjacent to an agricultural area. The secondary source is a river that runs parallel to the metropolitan area.    1      AFQTP 4B051-21                                                                 Journeyman Training Guide:  Water/Liquid Sampling   TASK STEPS  1.  Identify the source/type of water/liquid to be sampled.1 2.  Define the objective/purpose of the sampling.2 3.  Identify contaminants of concern.3 4.  Identify sample location.4 5.  Identify collection method/equipment.5 6.  Identify sample volume.6 7.  Identify sample container.6  8.  Identify preservation method.6 9.  Define sampling tactics. 10. Utilize OEHMIS (DOEHRS or equivalent), as applicable.    LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:  NOTES:  1.  Types of liquids you may sample are potable water (piped, packaged, or bottled), non-potable water (surface or ground), or unknown liquids.  2.  The objective/purpose for sampling includes characterizing the hazard (initial screening to determine presence/absence of contaminants of concern or special assessments to quantify contaminants), and monitor drinking water safety as part of routine surveillance.  The situation and objective for sampling can significantly influence the sampling strategy.  For example, when sampling drinking water quality to assess compliance with health standards, strategies are thoroughly outlined in regulatory statutes. In contrast, initial sampling of surface water during an OESHA will take some thought and planning.  Local emergency plans and checklists could also spell out courses of action for sampling in contingency situations.  3.  Common contaminants of concern are heavy metals, organic and inorganic compounds, radiologicals, fecal coliform, and other biologicals.  State agencies will provide requirements for the respective state.   4.  Your installation ESAM Plan outlines all drinking water sampling sites used to monitor drinking water safety.  A conceptual site model, if available, should also detail areas and contaminants of concern.  If you are collecting samples for the purpose of monitoring drinking water safety, you must use a method approved by the appropriate primary EPA regulatory agency.  Standard Methods for the Examination of Drinking Water and Wastewater is another source of analytical methods.  Equipment factors that contribute to the selection of a sampling device used for sampling surface waters in streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, lagoons, and surface impoundments are: width, depth, flow and accessibility of the location being sampled.  Whether the sample will be collected onshore or offshore the equipment should be constructed of material that will not interfere with sample integrity via leaching and sorption of target analytes.  6.  Sample volume required, the container, and required preservation method will all be specified in either the Standard Methods for the Examination of Drinking Water and Wastewater or the analyzing lab.  These will vary depending on the contaminant of concern. 5.    2  AFQTP 4B051-21                                                                 Journeyman Training Guide:  Water/Liquid Sampling   TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS       STS Line Item 4.15.3.2:  Develop a water/liquid sampling strategy 1.

What should be included in a SAM plan?  A:  A listing of all regulatory guidance that governs your drinking water sampling, analysis, and monitoring. Identification of all drinking water sampling sites used to determine compliance with the SDWA. BE will maintain certification documents from the primacy (state or federal agency that has primary enforcement responsibility) on these sampling sites where appropriate (e.g., lead and copper sampling sites and bacteriological sites). Annual and long-range drinking water sampling schedule. Description and classification (e.g., community/non-community, transient/non-transient) of each Public Water System and approval of the description by the primacy. Typically, your responsibilities with regards to these types of systems include recreational areas and geographically separated units supported by the parent Wing or Medical Group. Locally developed procedures for conducting the drinking water surveillance program. These procedures should include a schedule for routine monitoring, monitoring of aircraft watering points, increased monitoring for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear.

Complete Training Module 4.15.3.8 and Training Module 4.15.3.9 before completing this training module.  These prerequisite items should be re-evaluated when completing this module. AFI 48-114, Swimming Pools, Spas and Hot Tubs, and Bathing Areas  4B051  â¢  Sterile sample containers â¢  DPD kit Conduct hands-on training and evaluation. Given sampling supplies and equipment, collect a water sample from a swimming pool successfully completing all checklist items with NO trainer assistance. Per AFI 48-114, spas and hot tubs are not sampled routinely for bacteriological quality, but is recommended in instances of illness outbreaks (reference: Centers for Disease Control, various publications). AFI 48-114, gives information on illnesses related to spa/hot tub use. Spas and hot tubs should be sampled routinely for pH, chlorine and temperature. Use aseptic methods at all times to avoid contaminating the sample.     6  AFQTP 4B051-21                                                                 Journeyman Training Guide:  Water/Liquid Sampling   TASK STEPS  1.  Determine appropriate sample time and location (maximum swimmer load).1 2.  Measure pH and chlorine (see Training Modules 4.15.3.8 and 4.15.3.9), as applicable.2 3.  Use aseptic methods at all times to avoid contaminating the sample. 4.  Uncap a sterile sample container.3 5. Hold the sample container near the base at an angle of 45o. 6.  Fill the sample container at a depth of approximately 0.3- 1meter (1-3 feet).4 7.  Cap the sample container. 8.  Properly label the sample container. 9.  Properly store/transport the sample container.5 10.  Utilize DOEHRS, if applicable.  LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:    NOTES:  1.  Sampling locations should reflect water quality within the entire recreational area. You must be aware of sites upstream and adjacent to recreational areas that may influence water quality such as stormwater or wastewater discharge points.  For natural bathing areas take samples over a range of environmental and climatic conditions, especially during times when maximal pollution can be expected (periods of tidal, current, and wind influences, storm water runoff, wastewater treatment by-passes).  Collect samples during periods of maximum swimmer load. BE shall perform water quality sampling at natural bathing areas based on risk. Risk factors to consider include, but are not limited to, proximity to suspected pollution sources, level of bathing area use, historical water quality data, and occurrence of sewage spills or other pollution events. If local or state regulatory agencies have current data, those data may be used and BE can determine what, if any, additional parameters need to be evaluated. If BE decides not to sample at natural bathing areas, the rationale behind the decision shall be documented.  2. PH and Chlorine must be annotated for the purpose of comparison for routing sampling. Chlorine reacts with the pool water to form hypochlorite and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) which kills pathogens and is an indicator of water quality. Combined Chlorine: the amount of chlorine that has reacted with inorganic (nitrates, etc.) and organic nitrogen-containing molecules (urea, etc.) to make weak disinfectants that are unavailable for disinfection and free chlorine is the chlorine that is left over and is available to for disinfection.  3.  The size of the container will vary with the number and variety of tests to be performed.  Refer to AFI 48-114 and local lab standards for analytical requirements and recommendations.  When sampling chlorinated sources, the sample container must contain a dechlorinating agent.   4.  Fill container in one slow motion sweeping down through the water with the mouth of the container always ahead of the hand. Avoid contaminating the sample container with floating debris. Ensure the inside of the cap remains untouched while holding the inside of the cap downward.  5.  Lab guidance recommends holding samples at <10oC during transport until analysis. Sampling should test for that E. coli and enterococci be used as the indicator organisms for evaluating the microbiological suitability of the water in freshwater natural bathing areas.  7  AFQTP 4B051-21                                                                 Journeyman Training Guide:  Water/Liquid Sampling   TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS     STS Line Item 4.15.3.3:  Collect water samples from swimming pools, hot tubs, spas, natural bathing areas or other non-potable sources 1.

Given a HAPSITEÂ® (GC/MS), perform pre-operational check and operate instrument successfully completing all checklist items with limited assistance on only the hardest parts. Notes: *The HAPSITEÂ® is a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) proven to provide verifiable data for critical health-risk decisions. The HAPSITEÂ® systems deliver fast, dependable on-site analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air, water, and soil for emergency response, environmental, hazardous waste, industrial hygiene, process monitoring, and medical applications. The HAPSITEÂ® Headspace sampling system supports the HAPSITEÂ® Smart Chemical Identification System in detecting and identifying VOCs in water or soil on-site or from another location.  INFICON recommends storing the HAPSITEÂ® Smart in extended standby mode. This keeps the NEG (pump) operating at 400Â°C and the ion pump ON to maintain proper vacuum conditions. Extended standby ensures the battery is charged and ready for deployment/response. While extended standby is recommended, it is not a substitute for system use and it is not a feature to extend the time period between system operations. Using the system or running a weekly Blank Run is the best method to ensure overall operational readiness.  The Guidance Document (HAPSITEÂ® Field Guide) referenced above is designed to provide userâs the capability to maximize the use of deployment technology at both garrison and deployed environments in both routine and emergency response situations.        11  AFQTP 4B051-21                                                                 Journeyman Training Guide:  Water/Liquid Sampling   TASK STEPS  START UP FROM STANDBY MODE: (These steps are ONLY for resuming use when the HAPSITEÂ® has been placed in STANDBY MODE.) 1.

Given a DR 2800 Spectrophotometer, perform pre-operational check and operate instrument successfully completing all checklist items with limited trainer assistance on only the hardest parts. DREL 2800 Complete Water Quality Lab with Meters is designed to function as a fully equipped portable laboratory, able to run approximately 100 tests on 20 different parameters. We cannot cover all of the tests in this QTP so we will concentrate on one test, the test for Cyanide. Before starting the Cyanide test it is recommended to use a water bath to maintain the optimum temperature for the reaction in this test (77 Â°F/25 Â°C). Samples at less than 73.4 Â°F/ 23 Â°C require longer reaction times, and samples at greater than 77 Â°F (25 Â°C) yield low results. All samples to be analyzed for cyanide should be treated by acid distillation except when experience has shown that there is no difference in results obtained with or without distillation. To complete acid distillation, see Acid Distillation on page 249 of the DR 2800 Spectrophotometer PROCEDURES MANUAL      21  AFQTP 4B051-21                                                                 Journeyman Training Guide:  Water/Liquid Sampling    TASK STEPS  Test Preparation: 1.

Given a DR 2800 Spectrophotometer, perform pre-operational check and operate instrument successfully completing all checklist items with limited trainer assistance on only the hardest parts. DREL 2800 Complete Water Quality Lab with Meters is designed to function as a fully equipped portable laboratory, able to run approximately 100 tests on 20 different parameters. We cannot cover all of the tests in this QTP so we will concentrate on one test, the test for Cyanide. Before starting the Cyanide test it is recommended to use a water bath to maintain the optimum temperature for the reaction in this test (77 Â°F/25 Â°C). Samples at less than 73.4 Â°F/ 23 Â°C require longer reaction times, and samples at greater than 77 Â°F (25 Â°C) yield low results. All samples to be analyzed for cyanide should be treated by acid distillation except when experience has shown that there is no difference in results obtained with or without distillation. To complete acid distillation, see Acid Distillation on page 249 of the DR 2800 Spectrophotometer PROCEDURES MANUAL      31  AFQTP 4B051-21                                                                 Journeyman Training Guide:  Water/Liquid Sampling    TASK STEPS  Test Preparation: 1.

Given sampling supplies and references, collect a potable water sample for chemical analysis successfully completing all checklist items with NO trainer assistance. When comparing the tasks of collecting chemical and radiological samples, there are some differences in sample container types, sample volume, and preservation methods; however, the steps for collecting a sample for either are the same.

Identify sample location, sampling equipment and supplies, and parameters.1 2.    Prepare sample container, if necessary, per appropriate guidance.2 3.    Preserve sample as required.3 4.    Remove faucetâs aerator or strainer, if installed. 5.    Flush water line long enough to get a sample representative of the source (see Notes for exceptions).4 6.    Collect required volume and recap the container.5 7.    Mark the liquid level on the outside of each container. 8.    Label the container.6 9.    Document field information (i.e., name, date, time, location, sample number, analyte, etc.) on appropriate form/log. 10.  Utilize OEHMIS (DOEHRS or equivalent), as applicable.    LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:  NOTES:  1.  The ESAM Plan, if available, contains much of the information needed to determine sample location, parameters, and sampling equipment and supplies.  The Plan identifies all drinking water sampling sites used to determine compliance with the SDWA and locally developed procedures for conducting the drinking water surveillance program.  Other sources for this information are: standard Methods, servicing laboratory guidance, and respective State Environmental Protection Agency statutes.  For training purposes, Standard Methods, 21 Ed, Table 1060:I lists sampling and handling requirements for various analytes. 2.  Sample containers obtained from a laboratory may contain preservative. 3.  Preservation methods you will use are generally limited to pH control, chemical addition, the use of amber and opaque bottles, and refrigeration. Preserve samples as recommended by the ESAM Plan, Standard Methods, or the servicing laboratory.  4.  For most chemical and radiological sampling, flush the line 3 to 5 pipe volumes or until the water is being drawn directly from the source.  If the pipe volume is unknown, flush with tap fully open for at least 2-3 minutes before sampling. EXCEPTIONS: 1) some sample methods require âfirst drawâ samples, for example, lead and copper. Do not flush the lines when first draw samples are required; 2) when sampling for VOCs, flush the line until the temperature stabilizes--about 10 minutes. 5.  Most radiological and chemical analysis require 1 liter sample volume check with servicing laboratory for specific sample volume.  For certain analytes, larger or small samples are necessary. Radiological analyses sample containers vary in size from 0.5 to 18 liters. Do not pre-rinse the containers with sample water.  Pre-rinsing results in loss of any pre-added preservative and certain components can sometimes adhere to the sides of the container biasing results.  Do not overfill the container.  Except when sampling for volatile organic compounds (VOC), leave air space in the container to allow for thermal expansion.

Uncap container of 100 ml water sample using proper antiseptic techniques.1 2.  Add one packet of ColilertÂ®, Colilert-18Â®, or ColiSureÂ® media to the sample. 3.  Recap sample container and swirl the bottle to mix media with water. 4.  Preheat the sample in a water bath (only if using Colilert-18Â® or ColiSure).2 5.  Incubate sample for the proper amount of time.3 6.  Observe each sample for color change using a comparator.4 7.  Properly interpret presence/absence of total coliform.5 8.  Examine positive total coliform samples for florescence using an ultraviolet lamp.6 9.  Properly interpret presence/absence of E. coli. 10.  Record results on appropriate form/log.7 11.  Utilize OEHMIS (DOEHRS or equivalent), as applicable.   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:  NOTES:  1.  Ensure antiseptic methods are used throughout the process including rubber gloves and ensuring the cap faces downward  2.  When using Colilert-18Â®, preheat sample at 35oC for 20 minutes or 44.5oC for 7 - 10 minutes.  When using ColisureÂ®, without being placed on any surface.  preheat sample to room temperature.   3.  Time depends on method used. If using Colilert-18Â®, incubate for 18-22 hours. Otherwise, incubate for 24-28 hours at 35o C +/- 0.5 degrees.  4.  The sample should be compared against a commercial color comparator to ensure accurate interpretation.  5.  When using ColilertÂ® and Colilert-18Â®, interpret results as follows:  â¢  If no yellow color is observed, the sample is negative for total coliform. â¢  If color is not uniform, mix by inversion then recheck. â¢  If color change is questionable (less yellow than the comparator), the sample may be incubated an additional 4 hours (but no more than 28 hours total).  If the sample is coliform positive, the color will intensify. If it does not intensify, the sample is negative. â¢  If yellow is observed equal to or greater than the comparator, the sample is total coliform positive, confirm presence/absence of E. coli.  When using ColiSureÂ®, interpret results as follows:  â¢  If yellow/gold is observed, the sample is negative for total coliform. â¢  If red or magenta is observed, the sample is positive for total coliform, confirm presence of E. coli.  6.  Use a long-wavelength (365-nm) UV lamp (preferably 6W bulb).  Compare each positive total coliform sample against a commercial reference comparator.  The presence of fluorescence indicates a positive test for E. coli.  Face light away from your eyes towards the sample.  7.  The time the sample is placed and removed from the incubator, the temperature at which the incubator is at the beginning and end of incubation and the result must be documented on the log.     53  AFQTP 4B051-21                                                                 Journeyman Training Guide:  Water/Liquid Sampling   TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS       STS Line Item 4.15.3.12:  Perform presence-absence method  (Bacteriological / E. coli) 1.

Is a temperature of 36.1oC an acceptable incubation temperature for the P/A test method?    A:  No, the sample should be incubated at 35ÂºC Â± 0.5ÂºC for 24 hours.  (Source: 4B051 CDC)  2.  When checking sample results at the end of the incubation period, what action may be taken if the sample is yellow, but lighter than the comparator?  A:  If there are questions as to whether the water sample is yellow enough, compare it to the color comparator you can order with the media.  If the sample is lighter than the comparator, incubate for another four hours, but do not exceed 28 hours.  (Source: 4B051 CDC)  3.  A yellow, red, or magenta color that is at least equal to the comparator confirms the presence of what?  A:  When yellow is observed, the sample contains total coliform organisms.  (Source: 4B051 CDC)  4.  Describe the characteristics of an E. coli positive sample?   A:  If you have determined the sample contains total coliform organisms, you can confirm if the sample contains E. coli by placing a 6-watt 365 mm ultraviolet lamp within 5 inches of the sample container.  If the sample fluoresces (glows) the presence of E. coli is confirmed.  If the sample is yellow but does not fluoresce, the sample is positive for total coliform, but negative for E. coli.
