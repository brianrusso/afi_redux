Compliance  statements  have been tiered. Organizational designations have been updated. The role and responsibilities of 635 SCOW  have  been  eliminated  as  that  unit  no  longer  participates  in  the  SRRB.  Redundant  lead MAJCOM/A4P  responsibilities  have  been  eliminated.  Use  of  the  MAJCOM  Validation  Tool 2 AFI23-120  13 APRIL 2016 requirements  is  explained.  Narrative  on  advanced  forecasting  tools  has  been  removed. Justification of the SRRB process has been added. Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS)/LGPS roles and responsibilities for the SRRB process have been expanded. 1.  Overview.  The SRRB is an annual collaborative effort to develop the total AF Future Years Defense  Program  (FYDP)  flying  hour  spares  requirement  for  AFCS  funding  approval.    It establishes  the  guidelines,  roles  and  responsibilities  for  preparation  of  Headquarters  Air  Force Materiel  Command  (HQ  AFMC)  Working  Capital  Fund  (WCF)  and  Fund  Holders’  budget submissions based upon projected spares computations.  These reparable and consumable items are  managed  through  the  Supply  Division  of  the  Consolidated  Sustainment  Activity  Group (CSAG-Supply).  This  instruction  provides  guidance  on  the  CSAG-S  (Air  Force  reparable  and consumable items) requirements submitted in the Program Objective Memorandum (POM). 2.  Spares  Requirements  for  Budget  Submission.  The  Air  Force  established  the  SRRB  to combine  separate  AFMC,  MAJCOM  and  ANG  budgeting  processes  for  flying  hour  spares requirements and to  validate the Air Force Cost  Analysis  Improvement  Group (AFCAIG) Cost per Flying Hour (CPFH) budget submission for CSAG-S requirements. 2.1.  The SRRB  comprises representatives from  SAF/FM, HQ USAF/A4PY, the Air Force Sustainment  Center  Supply  Requirements  Branch  (AFSC/LGPS),  Air  Force  Life  Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) and Air Force Nuclear Weapon Center (AFNWC) Weapon System Single Managers, the Lead MAJCOMs and Fund Holders. 2.2.  Each  Fund  Holder  submits  a  POM  identifying  their  flying  hour  spares  requirements.  These requirements are validated and incorporated into the AFCAIG CPFH Program process.  Non-fly spares requirements are incorporated into MAJCOM organizational and maintenance program processes and excluded in this instruction. 2.3.  AFMC  uses  the  validated  requirement  to  develop  buy  and  repair  funding  requests  and assist  in  sales  and  revenue  projections  for  the  WCF  budget.    Pipeline,  safety  level,  and readiness  spares  package  requirements  are  essential  to  meet  the  Aircraft  Availability  (AA) goals for each Mission Design Series and are included in the WCF Budget. 2.4.  Results  of  the  annual  SRRB  process  reflect  the  total  projected  MAJCOM  demand replenishment  requirements  for CSAG-S spares essential to  achieve the Air Force fleet  AA targets derived from assigned mission taskings. 2.5.  The  CSAG-S  budget  reflecting  the  SRRB  outcome  is  submitted  by  the  AFSC  to AFMC/FMR  and  in  turn  to  SAF/FMBOR.    HQ  USAF/A4PY  coordinates  CSAG-S  budget submissions with AFCS members. 3.  Responsibilities and CPFH Development: 3.1.  The SRRB.  HQ USAF/A4PY and AFSC/LGPS co-chair the SRRB.  They manage this multi-phased  process  and  are  responsible  for  determining  and  validating  the  flying  hour spares  requirements,  and  submitting  the  validated  requirement  to  the  AFCS  for  funding consideration  during  the  Air  Force  POM  deliberations.    Air  Force  Special  Operations Command  (AFSOC)  and  Transportation  Working  Capital  Fund  (TWCF)  follow  guidance from their Corporate Structure. 3.1.1.  The SRRB is a multi-functional group of Weapon System (WS) stakeholders from the  collective  logistics  community  that  collaborate  to  analyze  and  refine  aircraft  spares AFI23-120  13 APRIL 2016 3 requirements for future years.  Two aspects justify the criticality of this effort:  the lead-time for aircraft spares (18-24 months) and that spare parts cost over $3B of the Flying Hour Program (FHP) budget.  The SRRB goal is to prepare the AFCAIG CPFH team for the fiscal year POM efforts. 3.1.2.  The  SRRB  uses  the  D200A  Secondary  Item  Requirements  System  (SIRS),  a subsystem  of  the  Requirements  Management  System  (RMS),  to  compute  the  CSAG-S base level maintenance demands for flying hour spares.  The base level not reparable this station  (NRTS)  and  base  condemnations  forecast  is  compared  to  the  requirement submitted  by  the  Fund  Holders.    Disconnects  are  addressed  through  a  face-to-face meeting  and  teleconferences,  with  adjustments  made  based  upon  known  changes  or forecast  deficiencies.    Finalized  computations  are  stated  in  current  year  dollars.  Computations  are  based  upon  Sub-group  Master  National  Stock  Number  (SGM-NSN) level demands placed on the supply system or the quantities of each SGM-NSN forecast to  be  consumed  by  the  MAJCOMs  per  weapon  system.    Note:    While  the  goal  of  the SRRB is to submit the same forecast for both RMS and the Fund Holders, ultimately the Item  Manager  (IM)/Equipment  Specialist  (ES),  and  the  Fund  Holders  should  be  able  to defend their own particular requirement.  In some cases, a consensus cannot be reached due to slight differences in the individual processes.  In others, a disconnect may require additional research/review for final resolution.  The current goal of the SRRB is to have an overall requirement disconnect of less than 3 percent. 3.1.3.  The Fund Holders’ final SRRB SGM-NSN line requirements (“eaches”) are priced out using the current D043 Price File or approved pricing and converted to a CPFH factor by  dividing  the  total  dollar  requirement  for  each  weapon  system  market  basket  by  the programmed flying hours used to build the forecast, resulting in a CSAG-S spares CPFH factor template for each year of the FYDP. 3.1.4.  The  CSAG-S  Spares  CPFH  factors  templates  are  provided  to  the  Air  Force  Cost Analysis  Agency  (AFCAA)  to  provide  an  independent  risk  analysis  of  the  values.  AFCAA  also  applies  Office  of  the  Undersecretary  of  Defense  Comptroller  (OUSD-C) approved known or estimated WCF rate/price changes (which include projected inflation) to convert the FYDP template values into then-year CPFH values for development of the budget requirement. 3.1.5.  The  then-year  CSAG-S  spares  CPFH  factors  are  converted  to  future  year  budget requirements  by  multiplying  the  factors  by  the  most  current  approved  flying  hours contained in the Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment System (ABIDES) for each  year  of  the  FYDP.    AFSOC  and  TWCF  will  use  guidance  from  their  Corporate Structure and submit their own requirements through their POM process. (T-2). 3.1.6.  The results of AFCAA’s risk and budget requirement analyses are presented to the Executive AFCAIG for final validation and approval of the requirement.  The results of the  Executive  AFCAIG  are  presented  to  the  AFCS  for  funding/risk  consideration  and approval. 3.1.7.  Once  approved  by  the  Executive  AFCAIG,  the  Fund  Holders  include  the  flying hour  spares  requirement  forecast  in  their  POM  submission  to  the  AFCS  for  funding consideration in accordance with Air Staff-provided Annual Planning and Programming 4 AFI23-120  13 APRIL 2016 Guidance (APPG) and POM Preparation Instructions (PPI).  AFSOC and TWCF use their own programming guidance. 3.2.  Air  Force  Lead  Commands.    Participate  in  the  SRRB  process  by  validating  the programmatic changes that need to be incorporated into the Centralized Asset Management (CAM)  flying  hour  spares  forecast  computation.    This  validation  takes  place  through approval  of  templates  developed  in  the  SRRB  Input  and  Retrieval  Web  Tool  at https://msdis.hill.af.mil/srrb_v2.  Each Lead Command designates a primary and alternate point of contact to work with CAM Requirements Branch (HQ AFMC/A4FR) throughout the SRRB and CPFH factors development process. 3.3.  Air Force Fund Holders.  Fund Holders forecast spares requirements utilizing base level supply Net Sales consumption.  The projection is based on the same baseline timeframe and flying hours used by RMS.  Fund Holders designate an Office of Primary Responsibility to identify  and  validate  these  requirements  and  coordinate  CPFH  factors  and  funding requirements with their Financial Management (FM) and Planning (A8P) organizations and other Fund Holder organizations as required.  3.4.  AFMC. 3.4.1.  AFSC.    Implements  methods  and  maintains  models  to  compute  wholesale  and retail  materiel  requirements  for  Air  Force  centrally  procured  items,  including  items subject  to  coordinated  procurement  by  other  agencies  and  military  departments.  AFSC/LGPS  acts  as  the  AFMC  Office  of  Primary  Responsibility.    AFSC/LGPS  also implements  methods  to  accomplish  inventory  stratification  for  each  item  under  its management  control.    AFSC/LGPS  is  the  SIRS  system  functional  OPR  for  the  RMS.

The  SRRB  Computation  Process.  The  SRRB  process  begins  with  a  joint  SRRB  “Call letter” issued from HQ USAF/A4PY each calendar year.  The letter provides general guidance to the SRRB primary participants on the SRRB process, expectations, and schedule to prepare for the upcoming budget year submission. 4.1.  HQ  USAF/A4PY  and  AFSC/LGPS  conduct  periodic  teleconferences  with  the  SRRB members  throughout  the  various  stages  of  the  process  to  ensure  continued  progress.    An annual  Collaboration  Meeting  is  sponsored  by  the  Fund  Holders  on  a  rotating  basis. AFLCMC Program Managers, Single Managers, AFSC representatives or MAJCOMs/Fund Holders may identify weapon system programmatic changes that need to be incorporated into the  flying  hour  spares  forecast  computation.    These  changes  are  communicated  to  other SRRB members through templates that are available through the SRRB Input and Retrieval Web  Tool  located  at  https://msdis.hill.af.mil/srrb_v2  (DD  Form  2875  required).    Lead MAJCOM  representatives  and  Fund  Holders  review  and  discuss  the  program  changes  to ensure the Air Force has complete and validated information to be used by the RMS. 4.2.  The  RMS  asset  cutoff  date  of  31  March  of  the  current  year  is  used  in  the  SRRB forecasting  process  and  reflects  the  most  recent  validated  historical  consumption  data  (8 quarters)  immediately  preceding  the  SRRB  closeout.    RMS  computes  a  worldwide requirement for CSAG-S reparable and consumable items.  The MAJCOM Validation Tool (MVT)  provides  individual  MAJCOM  requirements  that  are  used  to  submit  eaches requirements  based  on  MAJCOM/Funds  holders  inputs  that  utilize  the  same  cutoff  date  as RMS  data.  MVT  folder  can  be  found  on  the  SRRB  Input  and  Retrieval  Web  Tool (https://msdis.hill.af.mil/srrb_v2).    Historical  consumption  at  the  NSN  level  is  used  to produce  historic  NSN  consumption  rates  by  dividing  the  eaches  in  the  historical  market basket by the hours flown in the same time frame.  These historic NSN consumption rates are multiplied by the planned future fly hours to calculate eaches requirements for each year of the FYDP and create a projected future market basket.  These requirements are adjusted for time  change  items,  TCTO’s  and  other  known  changes.  The  MVT  and  RMS  data  are  then compared  for  differences.    The  top  high  drivers  are  reviewed  and  adjudicated  through  the SRRB  disconnect  meeting  based  on  the  SRRB  Call  Letter  timeline.    After  the  projected eaches requirements are finalized, the final future NSN consumption rates are calculated by dividing  the  eaches  in  the  projected  future  market  basket  by  the  planned  future  fly  hours.  (Air  Force  Special  Operations  Command  (AFSOC)  follows  guidance  from  their  Corporate Structure) 4.2.1.  SRRB  Timeline.    SRRB  process  initiates  with  a  Call  Letter  with  an  attached Schedule/Timeline.    All  SRRB  stakeholders  must  adhere  to  the  annual  call  letter  and schedule/timeline  deadlines  to  ensure  the  entire  SRRB  process  is  captured  in  a  timely manner. 4.3.  HQ AFMC/FMR and AFSC/LGP use the validated SRRB requirement as the basis for the demand portion of the buy and repair funding requested in the budget.  The AFMC/FMR staff will use the funded Air Force customer requirement as the basis for revenue from which AFI23-120  13 APRIL 2016 7 to develop the CSAG-S budget and ensure its compliance with applicable SAF/FMBOR and OUSD-C guidance.

The CSAG-Mx repairs a wide range of customer assets, including aircraft, missiles, aircraft engines, and engine modules,  landing  gears,  electronics,  composites,  and  computer  hardware  and  software.  In addition,  the  CSAG-Mx  centers  are  the  primary  suppliers  of  repair  services  to  the  Supply Management Activity Group (SMAG-R). Consolidated  Sustainment  Activity  Group–Supply  Division  (CSAG-Supply)—The  CSAG-Supply  provides  policy,  guidance,  and  resources  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  Air  Force  for  spare parts,  in  war  and  peace.  The  CSAG-Supply  manages  weapons  system  spare  parts,  fuels, equipment, and items used for non-weapon system applications. Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group (CSAG)—The CSAG established 1 October 2008, is  an  innovative  approach  to  business  in  the  AFWCF.    The  mission  of  the  CSAG  is  supply management  of  reparable  and  consumable  items,  and  maintenance  activities.    CSAG  combines the activities of the Material Support Division (MSD) of the Supply Management Activity Group and  the  Depot  Maintenance  Activity  Group  (DMAG).    Under  CSAG,  business  operations formerly  known  as  DMAG  are  now  related  to  the  Maintenance  Division.    Likewise,  business operations formerly known as MSD are now referred to as the Supply Division. CSAG-S  Supply  Division—Supply  Division  activities  are  authorized  to  procure  and  manage reparable and consumable items for which the Air Force is the Inventory Control Point.  These items are generally related to weapon systems and ground support, and include both depot level reparables and consumables. CSAG-M  Maintenance  Division—Maintenance  Division  activities  are  authorized  to  perform:  (a)  overhaul,  conversion,  reclamation,  progressive  maintenance,  modernization,  software development,  storage,  modification,  and  repair  of  aircraft,  missiles,  engines,  accessories, components, and equipment; (b) the manufacture of parts and assemblies required to support the foregoing; and (c) the furnishing of other authorized services or products for the Air Force and other agencies of the Department of Defense.  As needed by the AFMC or higher authority, the Maintenance Division may furnish the above mentioned products or services to agencies of other departments  or  instrumentalities  of  the  U.S.  Government,  and  to  private  parties  and  other agencies, as authorized by law. Depot-Level Reparable Item—A reparable item of supply that is designated for repair at depot level or that is designated for repair below the depot level, but if repair cannot be accomplished at  that  level,  shall  have  its  unserviceable  carcass  is  either  forwarded  to  the  depot  for  repair  or condemnation, or reported to the ICP for disposition. Depot Level Reparable—An item of supply (except explosive ordnance and major end items of equipment) that is not normally expended or used up beyond recovery in the use for which it was designed or intended; an AF item that, when broken, can usually be made useful again through repair.    Reparable  items  are  characterized  by  an  Expendability,  Recoverability,  Reparability Category (ERRC) code of XD(x). Eaches—Term used to describe the count (quantity) of individual parts per NIIN AFI23-120  13 APRIL 2016 11 Expendable—Item is part of the end item or next higher assembly when installed; not a stand-alone or individual piece part. Fund  Holders—Fund  Holder  designation  establishes  advocacy  for  the  POM  identifying  their flying  hour  requirements  for  different  appropriations.    Funds  Holders  are  CAM  (active MAJCOMS), Air National Guard (ANG), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). Lead  Command—Lead  Command  designation  establishes  advocacy  for  weapon  systems  and their  support  systems  and  equipment  directly  associated  with  the  weapon  systems  during  their life cycle and clarifies responsibilities for all using and supporting organizations.  The designated Lead Command provides a primary input into the process of developing and maintaining a force structure  with  a  balance  of  complementary  capabilities.    Lead  Command  designation  is  not exclusive  to  Major  Commands  (MAJCOMs);  Field  Operating  Agencies  (FOAs)  and  Direct Reporting Units (DRUs) may also be designated.  Lead Command Assignments are contained in AFPD 10-9 Attachment 2. Materiel  Support  Division—Changed  to  CSAG  –  Supply.    A  division  of  the  Air  Force Consolidated  Sustainment  Activity  Group  (CSAG)  that  exists  within  the  AF  Working  Capital Fund  (WCF).    MSD  was  implemented  in  October  1997  as  part  of  the  Air  Force  stock  fund directed  by  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  in  Defense  Management  Decision  (DMD) 904.    It  incorporates  the  previous  Reparable  Support  Division  (RSD)  and  System  Support Division (SSD). Non-Expendable—Item  is  classified  as  “equipment”  and  can  perform  its  function  as  a  stand-alone item with power. Program  Objective  Memorandum—The  final  product  of  the  annual  programming  process within the Department of Defense which translated planning guidance into programs by aligning resources  with  specific  requirements  to  support  operations,  training,  maintenance  and  base support. Requirements  Management  System—A  collection  of  software  systems  that  capture  and process supply item demands and usage and computes future requirements of these items. Spares—Assets  that are put  on a shelf to  be used in  an  end-item  as required and may be non-expendable or expendable upon install. Weapon System Market Basket—The collection of all NIINs that comprise the required parts for a weapon system in a specific year.  The total value (dollar requirement) of a weapon system market basket is the sum of the individual part counts (eaches) times their respective prices.  The CPFH  of  a  weapon  system  market  basket  is  the  total  dollar  requirement  divided  by  the programmed flying hours used to build the market basket forecast.
