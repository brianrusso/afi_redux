Roles and Responsibilities.  This instruction outlines aircrew procedures applicable to safe operation  of  the  T-1A.    With  the  complementary  references  cited,  this  instruction  prescribes standard  operational  procedures  to  be  used  by  all  aircrew  operating  T-1A  aircraft.    Errors, omissions,  or  recommended  changes  to  this  publication  are  handled  in  accordance  with paragraph 1.5 of this instruction. (T-1). 1.2.  Pilot-In-Command  Responsibility  (Aircraft  Commander).  In  conjunction  with  other governing directives, this instruction prescribes T-1A procedures under most circumstances, but is  not  to  be  used  as  a  substitute  for  sound  judgment  or  common  sense.   The  pilot-in-command (PIC) is ultimately responsible for the safe and effective operation of the aircraft. (T-1). 1.3.  Deviations.  Deviations from the procedures in this instruction require specific approval of the MAJCOM/A3 unless an urgent requirement or an aircraft emergency dictates otherwise.  In such a case, the PIC will take the appropriate action to safely recover the aircraft. (T-1). 1.4.  References.  The primary references for T-1A operations are technical order (TO) 1T-1A-1, Flight Manual-T-1A Series Aircraft, and applicable supplements; AFMAN 11-247, T-1A Flying Fundamentals;  and  this  instruction.    Training  units  may  develop  local  standards  from  the procedures contained in  these documents.    Local  standards may be used  to  augment initial  and mission  qualification  training  defined  by  AFI  11-2T-1,  Volume  1,  T-1A  Aircrew  Training.  Although  local  standards  may  expand  these  basic  procedures,  in  no  case  will  they  be  less restrictive. (T-1). 1.5.  Recommended Changes and Waivers: 1.5.1.  Submit suggested improvements to this instruction on AF Form 847, Recommendation for  Change  of  Publication,  to  the  parent  MAJCOM  through  standardization/evaluation (stan/eval) channels.  AF Form 847 is listed as an adopted form in AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program [FMP].  Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out the form. (T-1). 1.5.2.  USAF/A3O is the approval authority for changes or revisions to this instruction. (T-1). 1.5.3.  Policy  and procedures are enacted to  provide quality  and consistency in  training and evaluation  whether  at  an  undergraduate  or  graduate   Occasionally,  unique circumstances  may  warrant  special  consideration  and  possible  waiver  of  policy  provisions.  At  the  same  time,  because  it  is  important  to  preserve  fidelity  of  training,  evaluation,  and policy implementation throughout the command, a process must be established for review of proposed waivers. (T-1). level. 1.5.4.  Waivers  that  change  the  intent  of  the  policy  outlined  in  this  instruction  are  not authorized without AETC/A2/3/10 (T-2) approval.  Unless otherwise stated in this document, Wing/CCs (T-3) are the approval authority for individual personnel exceptions to the policy outlined in this instruction caused by special or unusual circumstances. (T-1). 1.5.5.  AETC  Units.    Coordinate  T-2  waivers  through  AETC/A3VO  as  appropriate.  Squadron  commanders  will  submit  all  T-2  waiver  requests  through  command  channels  in AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015   5  electronic  format.    Waiver  requests  must  provide  justification  why  the  individual  or  unit cannot comply with requirements.  AETC/A3VO and the units will file a copy of approved waivers to  this volume according to  AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms  Management. (T-1). 1.5.6.  Operations  Group  (OG)  Commander.    The  OG/CC  of  local  supplements  will  handle waivers to unit supplemental guidance. (T-2). 1.6.  Definition  of  Specific  Terms.  For  the  purposes  of  this  instruction,  the  term  “student” refers  to  any  crewmember  enrolled  in  specialized  undergraduate  pilot  training  (SUPT), undergraduate  combat  systems  officer  training  (UCT),  pilot  instructor  training,  fixed-wing qualification training and combat systems officer (CSO) instructor training.  The use of the term “CSO” refers to students enrolled in UCT and instructor combat systems officer (ICSO) upgrade training; and qualified CSOs and ICSOs. 1.7.  Crew  Requirements.

Briefing guides are a reference list of items that may apply to particular missions. (T-2). 2.4.2.2.  Items  listed  may  be  briefed  in  any  sequence.    Those  items  covered  by  written squadron  standards  and  understood  by  all  participants  may  be  briefed  as  “standard.”  Each  guide  may  be  expanded  as  necessary  to  cover  other  important  items  of  the  flight.  Brief  only  those  items  applicable  to  the  particular  mission  and  in  sufficient  detail  to prevent any misunderstanding between crewmembers. (T-2). 2.4.2.3.  The  flight  briefing  will  be  structured  to  accommodate  the  capabilities  of  each crewmember in the flight. (T-2). 2.4.2.4.  If appropriate, an alternate mission will be briefed for each flight.  The alternate mission will be less complex than the primary and should parallel the primary mission.  If the  alternate  mission  does  not  parallel  the  primary  mission,  brief  the  specific  mission elements  that  are  different.    Mission  elements  or  events  may  be  briefed  airborne  if practical and flight safety is not compromised. (T-2). 2.4.2.5.  All missions, student and continuation training (CT), will be debriefed using the debriefing guide in Attachment 5 as a reference. (T-2). 2.4.3.

(T-2).   10  3.2.  Taxiing: AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015 3.2.1.  Obstacle  Clearance.  When  obstacles  affect  only  one  wingtip,  the  marshaller  may also  act  as  the  wing  walker  and  direct  the  aircraft  while  monitoring  the  affected  wingtip.  This requirement does not apply at the home station when fixed taxi routes are marked and provide a minimum of 10 feet of wingtip clearance from obstacles and other aircraft. (T-2). 3.2.2.  Taxi Interval.  Do not taxi staggered.  Maintain a minimum of 150 feet behind other aircraft while taxiing. (T-2). 3.2.3.  Ice and/or Snow Conditions.  Do not taxi during ice and/or snow conditions until all portions of the taxi route and runway have been checked for safe conditions.  Conditions to consider  are  snow  berm  locations  and  reported  taxiway  runway  condition  reading  (RCR) along the planned taxi route.  With ice or snow present, taxi on centerline with a minimum of 300 feet of spacing behind other aircraft.  For removal of snow and ice, refer to the aircraft TO  command  guidance,  and  TO  42C-1-2,  Anti-icing,  De-icing,  and  Defrosting  of  Parked Aircraft. (T-2). 3.2.4.  CSOs.

The T-1A will normally take off with a full fuel load from the home field.  The aircraft commander will decide whether to take off at the home field or out base with less than  a  full  fuel  load.    Factors  to  consider  include  weight  and  balance,  mission requirements, aircraft performance, weather conditions and fuel conservation. (T-3). 3.3.4.2.  Declare  “minimum”  or  “emergency  fuel”  to  the  controlling  agency  any  time  it becomes  apparent  the  fuel  remaining  at  final  touchdown  will  be  less  than  the requirements indicated in paragraphs 3.3.4.3 and 3.3.4.4.  After declaring minimum or emergency fuel, add the fuel status call and amount of fuel remaining (in minutes) to each new  air  traffic  control  facility.    Once  established  in  the  local  traffic  pattern,  add  fuel status with each radio transmission. (T-2). 3.3.4.3.  Minimum fuel for the T-1A is 500 pounds. (T-2). 3.3.4.4.  Emergency fuel for the T-1A is 300 pounds. (T-2). 3.3.4.5.  Aircrews must be aware that minimum fuel for landing may be greater than the fuel requirements of paragraphs 3.3.4.3 and 3.3.4.4, to ensure aircraft center of gravity limitations  are  not  exceeded  in  some  configurations  or  aircrew  and/or  passenger  and/or cargo  complements.    If  a  form  F  requires  fuel  to  be  in  the  tank  to  remain  within  CG, crews  will  not  plan  on  using  this  fuel  for  the  planned  sortie.    Example:  If  the  form  F AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015   11  requires  that  237  pounds  be  on  board  to  remain  within  landing  CG,  then  the  crew  will have a new minimum fuel of 737 pounds and new emergency fuel of 537 pounds. (T-2). 3.3.5.  Performance Data.  The minimum climbout factor for all takeoffs is 2.5.  Reference Zero  will  occur  no  later  than  the  departure  end  of  the  runway  for  all  initial  takeoffs  and touch-and-go departures. (T-2). 3.3.6.  Runway:  Note:  The minimum usable runway for takeoff, touch-and-go and landing is computed between arresting cables located on or above the runway surface. (T-2). 3.3.6.1.  The minimum runway length for T-1A takeoffs is 6,000 feet, critical field length (CFL),  or  the  distance  required  to  reach  reference  zero  whichever  is  greater.  EXCEPTION: Reference Zero calculations may take into account runway distance past a departure end arresting cable, however in  no case may “Reference  Zero”  occur past  the departure end of the runway. (T-2). 3.3.6.2.  The  minimum  runway  length  for  full-stop  landings  is  6,000  feet  or  computed landing distance, whichever is greater.  If a runway has landing distance available (LDA), the  LDA  must  be  at  least  6,000  feet  or  landing  distance  whichever  is  greater.    If  the tabular data landing distance is within 1,000 feet of the total usable runway for landing, aircrews must use the longer of the performance chart or tabular data landing distance.  If the  tabular  data  landing  distance  is  not  within  1,000  feet  of  runway  available,  aircrews may use tabular data landing. (T-2). 3.3.6.3.  The minimum usable runway length for touch-and-go landings must be equal to or greater than the applicable touch-and-go distance but never less than 6,000 feet.  (See T.O.  1T-1A-1-1  for  touch-and-go  distances  for  15,500  to  12,000  pounds  gross  weight.)  Touch-and-go  distances  reflect  the  most  restrictive  of  the  go  or  stop  option  from  the appropriate decision point (flaps and throttles).  From these points, the applicable touch-and-go distance allows acceleration, rotation, and climb to Reference Zero by departure end,  or  deceleration  to  stop  within  the  runway  remaining.    For  airfields  with  Declared Distances  as  defined  in  AFMAN  11-217,  Volume  1,  Instrument  Flight  Procedures, aircrews  will  use  the  shortest  of  Take-Off  Runway  Available  (TORA),  Accelerate-Stop Distance  Available  (ASDA)  or  Landing  Distance  Available  (LDA)  to  determine  the usable runway length for touch-and-go landings. (T-2). 3.3.6.3.1.  Touch-and-go 30-flap and 10-flap landings may be accomplished at 41 and 42  degrees  Celsius  if  all  of  the  following  conditions  are  met  (no-flap  touch-and-go landings are not authorized above 40 degrees): (T-2). 3.3.6.3.1.1.  The  aircraft  commander  will  ensure  that  PFPS  is  used  to  accurately meet  the  required  climb  gradient.    The  required  climb  gradient  may  be  reduced IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 3. 3.3.6.3.1.2.  Aircraft gross weight is 14,000 pounds or less. 3.3.6.3.1.3.  Field pressure altitude is 3,000 feet or less. 3.3.6.3.1.4.  Runway is dry. 3.3.6.3.1.5.  The shortest of TORA, ASDA, or LDA is greater than 9,000 feet. 3.3.6.4.  Minimum runway width for single-ship takeoffs and landings is 100 feet. (T-2).   12  AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015 3.3.6.5.  Minimum runway width for normal formation takeoffs is 150 feet.  If the runway is less than 150 feet wide, use the feed-on procedure for takeoff as described in AFMAN 11-247.  The minimum runway width for feed–on takeoffs is 100 feet. (T-2). 3.3.6.6.  Takeoffs  and  touch-and-go  landings  will  not  be  accomplished  on  unplowed runways when ice or snow is present.  These operations are permitted on plowed runways provided  the  plowed  portion  is  a  minimum  of  100  feet  wide  and  meets  the  minimum length requirements of paragraphs 3.3.8.1 through 3.3.8.3.  Additionally, the RCR of the plowed surface must be 12 or greater. (T-2). 3.3.6.7.  The  operations  group  commander  may  waive  the  requirements  in  paragraphs 3.3.6.1 through 3.3.6.6 on a case-by-case basis. 3.3.7.  Spacing: 3.3.7.1.  Takeoff.  Do  not  begin  the  takeoff  roll  until  preceding  aircraft  are  airborne  or clear  of  the  runway.    EXCEPTION:  Does  not  apply  to  the  wingman  during  15-second interval formation takeoffs. (T-2). 3.3.7.2.  Landing.  Land on runway centerline with 6,000 feet minimum spacing behind other  aircraft  unless  the  aircraft  is  airborne.    This  includes  touch-and-go  and  full  stop landings, and applies to single-ship and formation operations. (T-2). 3.3.8.  Low Approach.  During low approaches, do not allow the aircraft to touch down.  A restricted low approach is defined as no lower than 500 feet above ground level (AGL) or as directed by the controlling agency.  Minimum altitude to initiate a practice single-engine go-around is 100 feet AGL. (T-2). 3.3.9.  Crosswind Limitations.  The maximum crosswind limitation for takeoff and landing is 25 knots for a dry runway, 15 knots for a wet runway, and 10 knots for an icy runway. (T-2). 3.3.10.  Traffic Patterns: 3.3.10.1.  Tactical  Pattern.  A  tactical  pattern  is  one  turn  to  downwind  and  one  turn  to final either from initial or the closed pull up.  Single-engine and no-flap tactical patterns are prohibited (simulated or actual).  If necessary to configure during the break, establish the desired AOB prior to any configuration change.  The minimum speed in the break is 160 KIAS. (T-2). 3.3.10.2.  Closed  Pattern  (Tactical  or  Rectangular).  The  minimum  airspeed  to  begin the closed pull-up is 160 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS).  Maintain 160 KIAS minimum during  the  pull-up.    On  downwind,  maintain  minimum  speeds  for  fuel  weight  and configuration. (T-2). 3.3.10.3.  Bank Angles.  Pilots should adjust pattern spacing as to not exceed 30 degrees of  bank  in  the  final  turn  or  on  final.    Pilots  should  not  exceed  45  degrees  of  bank anywhere in the traffic pattern, to include the break during tactical overhead patterns. (T-2). 3.3.11.  No-Flap Landings.  Do not practice no-flap full-stop landings. (T-2). 3.3.12.  Circling  Approaches.  Do not  practice single-engine circling approaches or single-engine low-closed patterns. (T-2). AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015   13  3.3.13.  Simulated Dual Engine Flameout Patterns.  Do not practice simulated dual engine flameout patterns. (T-2). 3.3.14.  Crew Seat Change Procedures: 3.3.14.1.  The minimum altitude for seat  changes is  1,000 feet  AGL.   Seat  changes will not be conducted during a critical phase of flight. (T-2). 3.3.14.2.  Crew  seat  changes  on  the  ground  will  not  be  performed  with  the  engines running  unless  there  is  a  pilot  at  the  controls  at  all  times  to  guard  the  brakes.    Seat changes  with  only  two  crewmembers  on  board  will  not  be  performed  with  the  engines running. (T-2). 3.3.14.3.  At  the  discretion  of  the  aircraft  commander,  CSOs  may  unstrap  shoulder harnesses when occupying the jump seat and aft crew seats to facilitate training during air intercept operations or the low-level portion of formal training syllabus; and continuation training sorties. 3.3.15.  Delayed Braking: 3.3.15.1.  Delayed  braking  is  defined  as  the  time  and/or  distance  between  aircraft touchdown  and  brake  application.  Delayed  braking  is  also  defined  as  the  time  and/or distance  between  initiating  an  abort  and  brake  application.    Although  utilized  to  reduce brake energy, delayed braking increases landing distance significantly. 3.3.15.2.  Do not  let concern over brake energy  override  good judgment  in  stopping the aircraft.    Apply  the  brakes  based  on  the  runway  remaining,  not  on  hot  brakes  speed.  Apply  brakes  as  necessary  to  ensure  the  aircraft  does  not  depart  the  runway.    Do  not hesitate to use maximum braking if necessary.  Note: Charted stopping distances do not account  for  possible  decreased  braking  effectiveness  due  to  rubber  deposits,  especially when wet. (T-2). 3.3.15.3.  The ability to  delay braking during an abort is dependent upon several factors (e.g.  aircraft  speed,  runway  remaining,  RCR,  inoperative  aircraft  systems,  tailwind component, etc.).  Upon initiating an abort, if any doubt exists as to whether the aircraft will  stop  in  the  confines  of  the  runway,  immediately  apply  maximum  braking  until  the aircraft has slowed to a safe taxi speed.  As a guide, do not delay braking if the runway remaining is less than RCR-corrected CFL. 3.3.15.4.  When  landing,  do  not  delay  braking  when  runway  remaining  is  less  than  the RCR  corrected  landing  distance.    The  flare  component  of  the  landing  distance  is  not calculated separately and provides an added margin of safety.  Refer to TO 1T-1A-1-1 for additional  assumptions  concerning  landing  distance  and  landing  ground  roll  distance calculations.    If  any  doubt  exists  as  to  whether  the  aircraft  will  stop  in  the  runway remaining,  immediately  apply  maximum  braking  until  the  aircraft  has  slowed  to  a  safe taxi speed. (T-2). 3.3.16.  After landing.  Do not perform any after landing checklist items until the aircraft is clear of the active runway. (T-2). 3.4.  Maneuvering Parameters:   14  AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015 3.4.1.  C ritical Phases of Flight.  The following flight regimes are critical phases of flight: (T-2). 3.4.1.1.  Takeoffs and landings. 3.4.1.2.  Traffic pattern operations (instrument and visual) after initiating the base turn. 3.4.1.3.  Low-level navigation (below 1,000 feet AGL). 3.4.1.4.  Precontact (astern) and contact positions. 3.4.1.5.  Airdrop maneuver (IP to target). 3.4.2.  CSOs will only perform pilot monitoring duties.  (T-2) 3.4.2.1.  Exceptions: CSOs in CRS initial qualification training may fly autopilot coupled approaches  with  an  IP  in  the  left  seat.    These  CSOs  will  adhere  to  the  following restrictions: (T-2). 3.4.2.1.1.  CSOs will only fly with the autopilot engaged. 3.4.2.1.2.  Minimum weather for CSO-flown autopilot coupled instrument approaches is  a  ceiling  of  700  feet  and  visibility  of  2  sm,  or  approach  minimum  weather, whichever is greater. 3.4.2.1.3.  Transfer  of  aircraft  control  from  the  CSO  to  the  pilot  during  autopilot coupled instrument approaches will be initiated no later than 100 feet above approach minimums and no later than the missed approach point, but in no case lower than 300 feet  above  touchdown  zone  elevation  (TDZE)  or  airfield  elevation  (approaches terminating in a circle). 3.4.2.1.4.  CSOs are prohibited from flying the aircraft below 1,000 feet AGL unless being radar vectored for an IAP, cleared direct the initial approach fix for an IAP, or established on a segment of the approach. 3.4.2.1.5.  CSOs  are  prohibited  from  controlling  the  aircraft  during  visual  traffic pattern operations, go-around and/or missed approach and circling to land procedures and will only perform pilot monitoring duties. 3.4.2.1.6.  CSOs  are  prohibited  from  controlling  the  aircraft  during  takeoffs  and landings  (to  include  touch-and-goes)  and  will  only  perform  copilot  or  pilot monitoring duties. 3.4.3.  Cruise  Checklist.  If  actual  cruise  time  will  be  a  short  duration  (approximately  15 minutes), the cruise checklist does not have to be accomplished.  Aircrews transiting between airfields located in close proximity to each other (approximately 15 minutes) and remaining below  transition  level,  may  accomplish  the  pattern  checklist  in  lieu  of  the  after-takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, and before-landing checklists. (T-2). 3.4.4.  Transfer  of  Aircraft  Control.  At  all  times,  crew  members  must  know  who  has control of the aircraft.  Transfer of aircraft control will be made with the statement “Pilot (or copilot),  you  have  the  aircraft.”    The  individual  receiving  control  of  the  aircraft  will acknowledge  “Pilot  (or  copilot)  has  the  aircraft.”    The  individual  assuming  control  of  the aircraft will maintain control until relinquishing it as stated above. (T-2). AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015   15  3.4.4.1.  Crew  members  occupying  the  jump  seat  are  prohibited  from  manipulating  the autopilot controls or throttles. (T-2). 3.4.5.  Altitudes: 3.4.5.1.  Minimum altitude for visual flight routes VFR point-to-point navigation is 3,000 feet  AGL.    Aircrew  may  descend  below  3,000  feet  AGL  as  required  for  low-level entry/VFR arrival.  Do not descend outside of the area covered by the low-level or VFR arrival  chart.    If  flying  below  3,000  feet  AGL,  the  chart  must  be  annotated  with applicable vertical obstruction data. (T-2). 3.4.5.2.  Complete approach to stalls, traffic pattern stalls, slow flight, unusual attitudes, and flight characteristic demonstrations above 5,000 feet AGL. 3.4.6.  Weather Requirements.  Approach to stalls, traffic pattern stalls, slow flight, unusual attitudes, steep turns and flight characteristics demonstrations will be conducted in day visual meteorological conditions (VMC). (T-2). 3.4.7.  Stalls.  Do  not  practice  approach  to  stalls  or  traffic  pattern  stalls  beyond  the  stick shaker.  Note: A qualified IP must be at a direct set of controls for all practice approach to stall or traffic pattern stall training. (T-2). 3.4.8.  Asymmetrical Thrust Demonstration.  The yaw damper may be on or off.  The high speed maneuver will be performed at approximately 220 KIAS and the low speed portion at approximately 150 KIAS.  Calculate and use a maximum continuous thrust (MCT) to avoid over boosting the engines. (T-2). 3.4.9.  Yaw Damper Failure Demonstration.  The demonstration must be conducted below flight level (FL) 280. (T-2). 3.4.10.  Unusual  Attitudes.  Initiate recoveries above 130 KIAS and below 270 KIAS.  Do not exceed 45 degrees angle of bank.  Maximum pitch attitudes are 25 degrees nose up and 20  degrees  nose  down.    ompute  and  use  no  more  than  MCT  to  avoid  exceeding  engine limitations. (T-2). 3.5.  Night Operations: 3.5.1.  Night  Prohibited  Maneuvers.  In  addition  to  the  maneuvers  listed  in  paragraph 3.4.5., the following missions are prohibited at night: (T-2). 3.5.1.1.  Formation. 3.5.1.2.  Low level navigation. 3.5.1.3.  Air intercept. 3.5.2.  Taxiing.  Taxi spacing will be a minimum of 300 feet and on taxiway center line.  The landing/taxi  lights  will  normally  be  used  during  all  night  taxiing.    EXCEPTION:  Landing and/or taxi lights may be turned off when they might interfere with the vision of the pilots of an aircraft landing or taking off.  Pilots will bring the aircraft to a stop when the area cannot be visually and safely cleared. (T-2). 3.5.3.  Pattern  Restrictions.  Night  VFR  rectangular  patterns,  tactical  patterns,  visual straight-in approaches and circling approaches may be flown with the following restrictions: (T-2).   16  AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015 3.5.3.1.  Simulated single-engine and no-flap approaches and patterns, as well as, circling approaches may be flown at night if the ceiling and visibility is at least 2,000 feet and 3 statute miles (sm) or circling minimums, whichever is greater. 3.5.3.2.  Fields  used  for  this  training  must  be  familiar;  that  is,  instructors  must  have accomplished  either  T-1A  daylight  VFR  pattern  operations  or  a  daylight  circling approach at the airfield prior to night operations. 3.5.3.3.  Visual  or  instrument  glide  path  guidance  (including  global  positioning  system (GPS) vertical navigation received from a published area navigation (RNAV) instrument approach) must be available and used for all off-station night landings. 3.5.4.  Filing: 3.5.4.1.  Night  operations  require  the  filed  destination  and  alternate  (when  required)  to have an operable straight-in approach and glide path guidance.  Acceptable forms of glide path  guidance  are  visual  lighting  systems,  precision  guidance  systems,  and  also  include GPS vertical navigation retrieved from a published RNAV instrument approach.  Aircrew may perform enroute instrument approach work at facilities without glide path guidance, but may not descend below the minimum descent altitude (MDA).  Note:  For landing out of night circling approaches, the only runway required to have glide path guidance is the runway of intended landing.  (T-3) 3.5.5.  Lighting.  If requested by runway supervisory unit controllers or the air traffic control tower,  aircrews  may  turn  off  strobe  lights  during  the  hours  of  darkness  while  in  the  home base traffic pattern. (T-3). 3.6.  Take-off  and  Landing  Minimums  and  Pilot  Weather  Category  (PWC).  PWCs  are designed  to  reduce  the  exposure  of  pilots  with  limited  experience  to  the  risks  inherent  during periods  of  low  ceiling  and  visibility.    See  AFI  11-2T-1,  Volume  1,  for  PWC  certification requirements. 3.6.1.  Requirements: 3.6.1.1.  Certified  PWC  1  pilots  require  weather  equivalent  to  published  ceiling  and visibility approach minimums. (T-2). 3.6.1.2.  PWC 2 pilots require weather minimums of no less than a ceiling of 300 feet and visibility  of  1  sm  (5,000  feet  runway  visual  range  [RVR])  or  published  approach minimums,  whichever  is  greater.    EXCEPTION:  PWC  2  pilots  may  utilize  published ceiling and visibility approach minimums at home station.  (T-2). 3.6.1.3.  Published  ceiling  and  visibility  approach  minimums  may  be  utilized  if  at  least one certified PWC 1 pilot is occupying one of the pilot seats. (T-2). 3.6.1.4.  When  overriding  mission  requirements  dictate,  operations  group  commanders may  individually  authorize  any  qualified  T-1A  pilot  to  use  published  approach minimums. (T-3). 3.7.  Weather and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR): 3.7.1.  Weather Restrictions: AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015   17  3.7.1.1.  The  T-1A  will  not  be  flown  in  areas  of  forecast  or  reported  severe  turbulence, severe  icing,  freezing  rain,  or  freezing  drizzle.    If  severe  icing  or  turbulence  is encountered on a mission, but was not forecast, notify appropriate weather personnel or Air Traffic Control (ATC). (T-2). 3.7.1.2.  Do  not  cruise  or  conduct  multiple  pattern  operations  in  actual  moderate  icing conditions. (T-2). 3.7.1.3.  If  required  weather  minimums  cannot  be  maintained  during  a  low  level,  abort the route. (T-2). 3.7.1.4.  Do  not  exceed  30  degrees  of  bank  in  instrument  meteorological  conditions (IMC) unless safety of flight dictates otherwise. (T-2). 3.7.1.5.  Aircrews  will  utilize  all  means  necessary  (ATC,  WX  radar,  PIREPS,  SOF)  to avoid thunderstorms by 20 NM at or above FL 230 and 10 NM below FL 230. (T-2). 3.7.2.  Filing: 3.7.2.1.  Destination.  Do not file to a destination unless the ceiling and visibility for the estimated  time  of  arrival  (ETA)  (plus  or  minus  1  hour)  is  at  or  above  the  appropriate PWC  or  suitable  published  minimums,  whichever  is  greater.    EXCEPTION:  If  two  or more suitable alternate airfields are available, aircrews may file flight plans to the home field when the terminal weather is forecast to be below published landing minimums.  If this exception is used, aircrews will compute divert fuel for the most distant alternate. (T-2). 3.7.2.2.  Alternate.  See AFI 11-202, Volume 3 and AETC Sup. 3.7.3.  Remote or Island Destination.  Aircrews going to a remote or island destination will have fuel on board to hold 1 hour and 15 minutes (1+15) at the destination fix in place of an alternate.  Forecast weather will meet the following restrictions for ETA plus 2 hours: (T-2). 3.7.3.1.  The  prevailing  surface  crosswind  component  must  be  within  operational  limits IAW paragraph 3.3.9. 3.7.3.2.  When  filing  to  the  remote  or  island  destination,  the  precision  or  nonprecison approach selected must have both the ceiling and visibility be at or exceed the published minima.    If  a  precision  approach  is  available,  the  ceiling  and/or  visibility  may  be intermittently  below  the  non-precision  approach  minima  but  in  no  case  will  it  be  lower than  the  precision  approach  weather  minima.    Furthermore,  for  filing  purposes,  an airborne surveillance radar (ASR) approach will not be used as the airfield’s nonprecision approach. 3.7.4.  Takeoff: 3.7.4.1.  Minimums.  Base  the  decision  to  launch  local  (home  station)  sorties  on  the existing  weather  and  forecast  for  planned  landing  plus  1  hour.    Base  the  decision  to launch non-local (off-station) sorties on the existing weather at takeoff time.  Pilots will utilize  ceiling  and  visibility  to  determine  adequate  departure  weather.    PWC  2  pilots require a ceiling of at least 300 feet and visibility of 1 sm or published suitable approach minimums, whichever is higher, unless flying with a PWC 1 pilot.  EXCEPTION: PWC   18  AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015 2  pilots  may  use  suitable  published  approach  minimums  less  than  300  feet  and  1  sm  if departing the pilot’s home station. (T-2). 3.7.4.2.  IFR Departures.  In addition to the approved IFR departure methods outlined in AFI  11-202,  Volume  3,  and  AFMAN  11-217,  Volume  1,  aircrew  members  have  the following restrictions:  (T-2). 3.7.4.2.1.  Unable  to  Meet  Required  Climb  Gradient.  When  higher  priority methods of departing IFR are not possible and if authorized according to AFI 11-202, Volume  3,  aircrews  may  depart  VFR  or  climb  in  VMC  to  a  safe  IFR  altitude  (e.g. Min  Enroute  Altitude,  Min  Safe  Altitude,  etc.)  provided  a  minimum  2.5  climbout factor is met, and the weather permits a VMC emergency return to the departure field from an appropriate minimum IFR altitude. (T-2). 3.7.4.2.2.  Visual  Climb  Over  Airport  (VCOA).  Pilots  may  fly  published VCOAs after  completion  of  MAJCOM-approved  training.    Note:  Ensure  airspeeds  during maneuvering  are  appropriate  for  aircraft  configuration  and  bank  angle.    Target airspeed during VCOA departure is 180 KIAS. (T-2). 3.7.5.  Penetration  and  Approach.  During  actual  IMC,  a  precision  approach  (instrument landing system [ILS] or precision approach radar [PAR]) monitored by surveillance radar is the  preferred  approach.    This  does  not  prevent  instrument  training  for  other  types  of approaches if the ceiling and visibility are at or above required minimums for the approach being flown. (T-2). 3.7.5.1.  After commencing a penetration or approach, if weather subsequently is reported below the required minimums (ceiling or visibility), the approach may be continued to a missed  approach  or  landing.    Aircrew  must  ensure  the  aircraft  has  sufficient  fuel  to execute a missed approach and land  at  the alternate airfield  with  required fuel  reserves. PWC  2  decision  height  (DH),  decision  altitude  (DA)  or  MDA  will  be  determined  by reference  to  the  runway  threshold  elevation  (THRE)  or  touchdown  zone  elevation (TDZE) for straight-in approaches and field elevation for circling approaches.  Use field elevation if THRE or TDZE is unavailable. (T-2). 3.7.5.2.  The  use  of  PWC  2  minimums  on  a  precision  approach  ILS,  PAR  or  a  GPS approach  flown  to  lateral  navigation  (LNAV)/vertical  navigation  (VNAV)  minimums may require pilots to execute a missed approach prior to the published DH/DA.  In these instances, upon reaching PWC 2 minimums and making the decision not to continue the approach,  the  pilot  should  start  a  climb  immediately  while  proceeding  to  the  missed approach  point  (MAP)  or  missed  approach  waypoint  (MAWP).    Upon  reaching  the MAP/MAWP,  continue  the  missed  approach  procedure  or  ATC  issued  climb  out instructions, as applicable. (T-2). 3.7.5.3.  PWC 2 pilots  may  set  published  approach weather minimums  if the weather is equal  to  or  greater  than  1,500  feet  and  3  sm  (ceiling  and  visibility).    If  the  reported weather  is  below  1,500  feet  and  3  sm,  PWC  2  pilots  will  set  PWC  2  minimums  or published  approach  minimums  whichever  is  greater.    Additionally,  if  a  PWC  2  pilot having  set  appropriate  PWC  2  approach  minimums  in  the  aircraft,  encounters  VMC during the approach and is able to maintain visual contact with the runway environment, AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015   19  the  PWC  2  pilot  may  elect  to  continue  the  approach  to  the  published  approach minimums. (T-2). 3.8.  GPS Navigation: 3.8.1.  The  T-1A  is  Global  Navigation  Satellite  System  (GNSS)-equipped  and  meets  the requirements  for  IFR  GPS  operations  in  the  National  Airspace  System  (NAS)  Federal Aviation  Administration  (FAA)-controlled  airspace)  and  is  approved  for  RNAV  1  terminal (departure and arrival) and RNAV 2 en route operations (“T” and “Q” routes) (see TO 1T-1A-1  for  aircraft  certification  information).    T-1A  aircrews  may  use  GPS  as  the  primary navigational  source  for  all  IFR  operations  from  terminal  departure  through  en  route navigation  to  non-precision  approach  provided  the  aircraft  contains  a  current  Jeppesen® database. (T-2). 3.8.2.  T-1A  aircrews  will  check  Jeppesen®  NAVDATA  Alerts/Change  Notices/Notices  to Airmen (NOTAM) prior to every flight in which the Jeppesen® database will be relied upon. (T-2). 3.8.3.  The flight director must be utilized for all published RNAV operations in which GPS is the primary navigation source. Autopilot use is highly encouraged. (T-2). 3.8.3.1.  Aircrews  are  expected  to  maintain  route  and  course  centerlines  for  all  RNAV operations. (T-2). 3.8.4.  When flying “or GPS” approaches the underlying navigational aids (NAVAID) must be operational  and properly  displayed on the  “pilot  monitoring” instruments.   Day  VMC  is required for GPS overlay approaches if the underlying NAVAID cannot be displayed. (T-2). 3.8.5.  Since  the  T-1A  control  display  unit  (CDU)  does  not  display  RNAV  waypoint  type (flyby  or  flyover),  and  to  meet  the  requirements  of  AFMAN  11-217,  Volume  1,  aircrews must be vigilant to ensure that flight director guidance corresponds to each waypoint type as published in FLIP while flying published RNAV terminal and en route procedures.  In rare instances of a database error, pilot intervention of flight director guidance may be required to ensure the procedure is flown as published. (T-2). 3.8.6.  MAJCOM  review  and  approval  of  the  Jeppesen®  database  is  required  for  IFR operations outside the NAS. (T-2). 3.8.7.  Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). 3.8.7.1.  Preflight  Planning.  Aircrew  must  check  predictive  RAIM  prior  to  filing published RNAV terminal or en route procedures. (T-2). 3.8.7.1.1.  If  RAIM  is  not  available  along  the  planned  or  actual  route  of  flight  for more  than  5  continuous  minutes,  aircrews  should  alter  routing  or  plan  the  flight utilizing traditional navigational sources. (T-2). 3.8.7.1.2.  If  the  only  suitable  approach  at  an  intended  destination  requires  GPS, aircrews  must  check  predictive  RAIM  prior  to  filing  for  that  airfield.    If  predictive RAIM  forecasts  an  outage,  weather  must  allow  for  a  VFR  arrival,  approach,  and landing IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3. (T-2). 3.8.7.2.  Aircraft  Operations.  Aircrews  will  check  predictive  RAIM  utilizing  the aircraft FMS prior to: (T-2).   20  AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015 3.8.7.2.1.  Takeoff for any RNAV departure procedure (DP). 3.8.7.2.2.  Commencing  any  RNAV  standard  terminal  arrival  (STAR)  or  RNAV instrument approach procedure. 3.8.8.  RNAV  (GPS)  Instrument  Approach.  “DME/DME”  and  “WAAS”  notations  on published  “RNAV”  instrument  procedures  are  not  applicable  to  the  T-1A.    If  a  published RNAV procedure requires either, and has no provision for GNSS or GPS, T-1A aircrew may not  file  or  fly  the  procedure.    Additionally,  T-1A  aircrews  are  not  authorized  to  fly instrument  approaches  labeled  “RNAV/RNP.”    Suitable  procedures  for  the  T-1A  will  state “GPS Required” or “GNSS.” (T-2). 3.8.8.1.  The T-1A is certified for circling, LNAV MDA, and LNAV/VNAV DA minima for RNAV approaches.  The T-1A is not WAAS-equipped, therefore aircrew will not use: “GLS” or “LPV” minimums. (T-2). 3.8.8.2.  Aircrews must closely monitor the electronic attitude director indicator (EADI) and CDU for FMS messages during RNAV approaches.  The following CDU messages require  termination  of  an  RNAV  approach  and  coordination  with  ATC  for  an  alternate clearance  or  execution  of  a  missed  approach:  “GPS-FMS  DISAGREE,”  “GPS  NOT AVAILABLE,”  “NO  GPS  RAIM,”  “NO  APPR  GPS  RAIM”  (see  TO  1T-1A-1  for message descriptions).  These messages are not all inclusive and aircrews will coordinate for an alternate clearance anytime FMS/GPS integrity is in doubt. (T-2). 3.8.8.3.  The  T-1A  FMS  utilizes  an  uncompensated  barometric-vertical  navigation (BARO-VNAV)  aiding  system.    Cold  temperature  limitations  apply  to  T-1A  RNAV approach operations as specified in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1.  Additionally, aircrews may  not  descend  to  LNAV/VNAV  minimums  with  remote  altimeter  settings.  (See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, for additional guidance.) (T-2). 3.8.8.4.  Since  the  T-1A  CDU  does  not  display  RNAV  instrument  approach  segment distances in tenths of a mile and to meet the requirements of AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, aircrews  must  ensure  that  once  established  on  the  unverified  segments  of  the  approach, the  electronic  horizontal  situation  indicator  (EHSI)  distance  is  evaluated  to  ensure  an appropriate published charted value.  If the value is appropriate based on current aircraft position, crews may continue the approach.  Deviations from expected values should be treated  conservatively  and  crews  will  abort  the  approach  if  the  evaluated  distance  does not correspond to within 0.1 nm of the FLIP published value. (T-2). 3.8.8.5.  Depending upon RNAV approach procedure coding, in rare instances the T-1A FMS  can  strip  “step  down”  waypoint  fixes  from  the  J3-America  database  which  are located along the intermediate approach segment.  Flying these approaches is acceptable provided that the only change at the stripped waypoint is an altitude and the aircrew can identify  the  point  through  an  alternate  means  (e.g.  nm  distance  to  the  FAF).    Manual insertion of a waypoint into the approach is strictly prohibited.  (T-2). 3.8.9.  RNAV  1  Terminal  Procedures.  The T-1A is certified for FLIP published RNAV 1 [1  nm  total  system  error  (TSE)]  DPs  and  RNAV  1  STARs.  RNAV  DPs  and  STARS  are RNAV 1 unless depicted otherwise.  Some RNAV 2 procedures exist within the NAS,  and aircrews may fly these procedures using RNAV 1 guidance. RNAV DPs and STARs must be retrieved,  in  their  entirety,  by  procedure  name  from  the  FMS  database  and  aircrews  must AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015   21  ensure  that  the  proper  departure  or  arrival  runway  is  selected.    Manual  entry  of  waypoints using latitude/longitude or place/bearing is prohibited. (T-2). 3.8.9.1.  Since  RNAV  1  procedures  require  lateral  deviation  of  no  more  than  0.5  nm, aircrews  must  not  exceed  one  dot  on  the  course  deviation  indicator  (CDI)  of  the  EHSI (approximately  0.5  nm)  while  in  the  “Terminal  Mode,”  with  the  display  select  panel (DSP)  set  to  “FMS,  FMS”  and  flight  director  set  to  “NAV.”    Additionally,  aircrews should monitor cross track utilizing the MFD or CDU “Progress” page. (T-2). 3.8.9.1.1.  Some RNAV 1 terminal procedures may begin or terminate outside of the FMS “Terminal Mode” 30 nm area.  In these instances, one dot displacement on the CDI will not approximate the required RNAV 1 lateral accuracy. (T-2). 3.8.9.1.2.  Any time a segment of an RNAV 1 terminal procedure is flown outside of the  30  nm  “Terminal  Mode”  area,  aircrews  must  monitor  cross  track  utilizing  the MFD or CDU to ensure the aircraft remains within the 0.5 nm lateral tolerance of the RNAV 1 routing. (T-2). 3.8.9.2.  Aircrews must  closely monitor the EADIs and CDU for  FMS  messages during RNAV  1  procedures.    The  following  CDU  messages  indicate  position  errors  exceeding RNAV  1  tolerances,  and  require  termination  of  RNAV  1  procedures  and  coordination with  ATC  for  an  alternate  clearance:  “GPS-FMS  DISAGREE,”  “GPS  NOT AVAILABLE,” “NO GPS RAIM.” (See TO 1T-1A-1 for message descriptions.)  These messages  are  not  all  inclusive  and  aircrews  will  coordinate  for  an  alternate  clearance anytime FMS/GPS integrity is in doubt. (T-2). 3.8.9.3.  Course difference of up to 3 degrees is acceptable when comparing FMS loaded RNAV  1  departure  or  arrival  procedures  (RNAV  STARS  and  SIDs)  from  the  aircraft database to the FLIP published courses. (T-2). 3.8.9.4.  During RNAV 1 DPs, aircrews will select “NAV” on the flight director as soon as practical after takeoff to ensure lateral RNAV guidance is available and followed. (T-2). 3.8.10.  RNAV 2 En Route Procedures.  The T-1A is certified for FLIP published RNAV 2 (2  nm  TSE)  en  route  operations  in  Required  Navigation  Performance  airspace  (“Q”  or  “T” designated routes found in FLIP).  These procedures will be depicted and identified on FLIP as  “RNAV  2.”    Whenever  possible,  RNAV  2  routes  should  be  extracted  from  the  FMS database,  in  their  entirety,  by  inserting  the  starting  and  ending  waypoints  and  utilizing  the route name in  the “VIA” line of the flight  plan  pages of the CDU.  Selecting  and inserting individual, named fixes from the database is permitted utilizing the “TO” lines, however all fixes  along  the  published  route  to  be  flown  must  be  inserted.    Manual  entry  of  waypoints using latitude/longitude or place/bearing is prohibited. (T-2). 3.8.10.1.  Since CDI lateral deviation is automatically set by the FMS to 5 nm outside of the 30 NM terminal  area (with FMS selected on the DSP), aircrews  must monitor cross track utilizing the MFD or CDU to ensure the aircraft remains within the 1.0 nm lateral tolerance of the RNAV 2 routing. (T-2). 3.8.10.2.  Aircrews must closely monitor the EADIs and CDU for FMS messages during RNAV  2  procedures.    The  following  CDU  FMS  messages  indicate  position  errors   22  AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015 exceeding  RNAV  2  tolerances  and  require  termination  of  RNAV  2  procedures  and coordination with ATC for an alternate clearance: “GPS-FMS DISAGREE,” “GPS NOT AVAILABLE,”  “NO  GPS  RAIM.”  (See  TO  1T-1A-1.)    These  messages  are  not  all inclusive  and  aircrews  will  coordinate  for  an  alternate  clearance  anytime  FMS  and/or GPS integrity is in doubt. (T-2). 3.8.10.3.  Course  difference  of  up  to  3  degrees  is  acceptable  when  comparing  the  FMS loaded RNAV 2 route from the aircraft database to the FLIP published courses. (T-2). 3.9.  Low Level: 3.9.1.  Weather.  Comply with VFR cloud clearance requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 3.  For  locally  published  routes,  slow  routes  (SR),  and  instrument  routes  (IR),  aircrew  will ensure  a  minimum  ceiling  and  visibility  of  1,500  feet  and  3  sm.    For  VFR  training  visual routes (VR) see AFMAN 11-217, Volume 2. (T-2). 3.9.2.  Ground  Speed.  Planned  ground  speeds  on  military  training  routes  are  210  and  240 knots (maximum planned ground speed is 270 knots).  Aircrews should avoid actual ground speeds  exceeding  300  knots.    Maximum  IAS  on  a  slow  speed  training  route  (SR)  is  250 KIAS. (T-2). 3.9.3.  Altitudes.  Plan altitudes which provide adequate terrain and obstacle clearance.  The minimum allowable altitude on all low levels is 500 feet above the highest terrain or obstacle or greater if specified in FLIP, within 2,000 feet of the aircraft. (T-2). 3.9.4.  Obstacle Clearances.  Towers and other manufactured obstacles are more difficult to see  than  high  terrain.    Aircrew  will  fly  a  minimum  of  500  feet  above  the  highest  unseen obstacle within 2 NM of the aircraft.  Once the obstacle is visually acquired, aircrews will fly a minimum of 500 feet above, or laterally avoid the obstacle by a minimum of 2,000 feet. (T-2). 3.9.5.  Maneuvering.  During  low-level  operations,  aircrews  will  not  exceed  45  degrees  of bank unless required for safety of flight. (T-2). 3.9.6.  Daylight Restrictions.  Enter the route no earlier than 30 minutes after sunrise (1 hour for mountainous terrain) and exit the route no later than 30 minutes prior to sunset (1 hour for mountainous  terrain).    See  AFI  11-202  Volume  3,  General  Flight  Rules  and/or  14  CFR §95.11 for the definition of mountainous terrain. (T-2). 3.10.  Airdrop: 3.10.1.  Altitude.  The simulated airdrop maneuver is performed at a minimum of 1,000 feet AGL or 500 feet  above  planned route altitude.  When accomplished in  a military operating area  (MOA),  flight  lead  will  determine  an  appropriate  altitude.    Whenever  a  flight  path conflict  with  lead exists, wingman should  attempt to  cross high in  relation to  lead.  On the route, wingman will never fly below lead or 500 feet AGL, whichever is higher, unless safety dictates otherwise.  EXCEPTION: Wingman may fly below lead’s altitude during a climbing egress from a simulated airdrop or during route exit. (T-2). 3.10.2.  Configuration.  Airdrop  configuration  is  10  degrees  flap  setting  and  140  KIAS minimum. (Airspeed may be higher as briefed by flight lead.) (T-2). 3.11.  Formation Restrictions: AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015   23  3.11.1.  Takeoff, Approach, and Landing: 3.11.1.1.  Visual formation departures are not authorized when IMC will be encountered.  Separate departures (a separation of 1 minute or as determined locally) will be made with a join-up on top. (T-2). 3.11.1.2.  When  IMC  will  be  encountered,  formation  instrument  approaches  are  not authorized. (T-2). 3.11.1.3.  Drag approaches are authorized to expedite formation recoveries, but they must comply with the separation criteria. (T-2). 3.11.2.  Maneuvering: 3.11.2.1.  Practice lost wingman will be performed in day VMC above 1,000 feet AGL. (T-2). 3.11.2.2.  Formation is prohibited in IMC.  Formations on an IFR clearance will maintain clear of clouds.

Only  T-1A  formation-current  IPs  may  fly  safety  chase  for  aircraft  under emergency conditions (or impending emergency conditions). (T-2). 3.12.  Simulated Air Refueling: 3.12.1.  Turbulence  Restriction.  Do  not  fly  precontac    or  contact  positions  in  conditions exceeding  light  turbulence.    Turbulence  is  limited  to  no  greater  than  moderate  up  to  the astern position. (T-2). 3.12.2.  Separation.  Receiver  aircraft  will  maintain  1,000  feet  below  air  refueling  base altitude  until  visual  contact  is  established  with  the  tanker.    Rendezvous  closure  will  not  be continued when the in-flight visibility is such that the receiver does not have visual contact with the tanker at 1 nm. (T-2). 3.12.3.  Weather.  Weather  criteria  for  flying  precontact  and  contact  positions  are  an  in-flight visibility of 1 mile and clear of clouds. (T-2). 3.12.4.  Altitude  Restriction.  Do  not  conduct  closures  to  precontact  or  contact  from  the  1 mile visual position above FL 310. (T-2). 3.13.  Air Intercept: 3.13.1.  Maximum  Participating  Aircraft.  Maximum  participating  aircraft  during  air intercept is two. (T-2).   24  AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015 3.13.2.  Separation.  A  ircraft  will  coordinate  to  accept  MARSA  (Military  Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft) and will maintain a minimum of 1,000 vertical feet of separation during role reversals. (T-2). 3.13.2.1.  During  role  reversals,  participating  aircraft  will  ensure  a  minimum  of  1  nm separation  utilizing  the  air-to-air  (A/A)  function  of  the  aircraft  TACAN  (Tactical  Air Navigation)  and  diverging  courses  before  swapping  intercept  altitudes.    The  mission commander may direct the altitude swap with the aircraft commander’s concurrence. (T-2). 3.13.2.2.  Both aircraft will report established on altitude with the proper altimeter setting before commencing subsequent intercepts. (T-2). 3.13.2.3.  Both  aircraft  will  squawk  an  ATC  assigned  or  VFR  transponder  code  (as applicable) during air intercept operations. (T-2). 3.13.3.  Maneuvering.  Aircraft  will  not  exceed  45  degrees  of  bank  and  2  Gs;  and maneuvering  will  occur  in  the  horizontal  plane  only.    Maximum  use  of  the  autopilot  is recommended. 3.13.3.1.  Maximum  planned  intercept  airspeed  for  participating  aircraft  is  0.6  indicated MACH number (IMN). (T-2). 3.13.3.2.  Target  aircraft  are  limited  to  30  degrees  of  bank  and  should  not  exceed  60 degrees of heading change either side of planned intercept course. (T-2). 3.13.3.3.  Target  aircraft will cease maneuvering (roll wings level) no later than passing the  attacking  aircraft’s  3/9  line  (determined  visually  or  on  aircraft  systems)  unless required  to  maintain  airspace  boundaries,  avoid  weather  and/or  hazards  or  directed  by ATC. (T-2). 3.13.3.4.  Both A/A TACANs and automatic dependent surveillance broadcast  (ADS-B) (GDL-90)  functions  are  required  to  be  operable  on  both  aircraft  during  air  intercept.  EXCEPTION:  This  does  not  apply  to  air  intercept  training  utilizing  simulated  targets. (T-2). 3.13.4.  Altitude Restriction.  Air intercept will not be conducted below 5,000 AGL. (T-2). 3.13.5.  Airspace.  Air intercept will only be accomplished in special use airspace. (T-2). 3.13.6.  Weather.  Day-VMC only with a minimum of 1,000 feet vertical (above and below) and 1 NM horizontal cloud clearance and 5 nm in-flight visibility. (T-2). 3.13.7.  Terminate.  Intercepts  will  terminate  via  an  interplane  radio  call  no  later  than  the point at which the attacking aircraft acquires a zero aspect on the target aircraft; or to initiate role reversal; or for break-up recovery. (T-2). 3.13.8.  Mission  Commander.  A  certified  air  intercept  instructor  pilot  or  instructor  CSO will  be  designated  as  mission  commander  between  the  two  participating  aircraft  during mission  planning  and  is  responsible  for  ensuring  proper  coordination,  de-confliction  and execution of the mission. (T-2). AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015   25  3.13.9.  Aircraft  Maneuvering  Calls.  During  air  intercept  training,  CSOs  will  direct  the pilot  to  maneuver  the  aircraft  utilizing  the  following  standardized  interphone  terminology: (T-2). 3.13.9.1.  “Easy  (right  or left).”  Command to  roll to,  and maintain 15 degrees of bank, right or left, as directed. 3.13.9.2.  “Turn  (right  or left).”  Command to  roll to,  and maintain 30 degrees of bank, right or left, as directed. 3.13.9.3.  “Hard  (right  or  left).”  Command  to  roll  to,  and  maintain  45  degrees  of  bank, right or left, as directed. 3.13.9.4.  “Roll out.”  Command to roll wings level from any established turn. 3.13.9.5.  “Tighten down.”  Command to increase bank angle from 15 to 30 degrees or 30 to 45 degrees. 3.13.9.6.  “Ease turn.”  Command to decrease bank angle from 45 to 30 degrees or 30 to 15 degrees. 3.13.9.7.  “Hold.”  Command to maintain angle of bank during transitions into or out of a turn. 3.14.

(T-2). 3.15.1.8.  CSOs  may  only  perform  PM  duties  during  simulated  emergency  procedures. (T-2). AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015   27  3.16.  Uncontrolled  Airfields:  (See  AFI  11-202,  Volume  3.)    Note:  VFR  pattern  maneuvers may only be flown at airfields with an approved MAJCOM letter of agreement (LOA). (T-2). 3.16.1.  Each  operations  group  commander  will  develop  a  training  program  to  prepare aircrews  to  operate  in  the  uncontrolled  airfield  environment.    Prior  to  implementation, AETC/A3V  must approve the training program.  As a minimum, the program should include a discussion of all applicable codes of FAA regulations, advisory circulars, and Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM), Official Guide to Basic Flight Information and ATC Procedures, references  on  uncontrolled  and  non-towered  airport  operations.    Training  will  emphasize standard  common  traffic  advisory  frequency  (CTAF)  radio  phraseology  and  instrument approach procedures in a non-radar environment. (T-2). 3.16.2.  Each  operations  group  commander  will  develop  procedures  for  each  uncontrolled airfield  utilized.  (T-3).    These  procedures  should  include  (at  a  minimum):  normal  pattern operations,  pattern  breakout  procedures  and  emergency  procedures.  Other  information  may be included at the OG/CCs discretion. (T-2). 3.16.3.  With  a  certified  IP  in  either  pilot  seat,  T-1A  aircrews  may  conduct  VFR  pattern operations at uncontrolled public-use airfields, with the following restrictions: (T-2). 3.16.3.1.  They will be flown in the day only. 3.16.3.2.  They will be flown single ship only. 3.16.3.3.  Weather at the field must be equal to or greater than 3,000 feet and 3 sm. 3.16.3.4.  Winds must be within limits for each runway to which the aircrew operates. 3.16.3.5.  All patterns and approaches will be flown to a low approach unless landings are specifically  permitted  in  the  LOA.    In  the  event  an  unplanned  landing  is  required,  the OG/CC will ensure fire or crash recovery and maintenance line personnel, as appropriate, are  available  for  the  subsequent  launch.    (T-3).    Aircrews  will  make  CTAF  radio  calls prior to taxiing and taking the runway for takeoff. 3.16.3.6.  A ircrews will monitor the published CTAF frequency and will, at a minimum, make radio calls and position reports at approximately 10 miles from the airfield to report intentions; entering downwind; entering final; and departing the airfield. 3.16.3.7.  No more than two aircraft total (military or civilian) may be in the pattern.   If additional aircraft enter the pattern for the purpose of performing multiple approaches, T-1A  aircrews  will  depart  the  airfield  as  soon  as  practical.    If  additional  aircraft  enter  the pattern  for  full  stop  landings  only,  aircrews  do  not  need  to  depart  the  airfield,  but  may breakout of the pattern and re-enter once the aircraft has landed.  If two or more aircraft are already in the traffic pattern, aircrew will not attempt to enter the pattern. 3.16.3.8.  Standard rectangular patterns will be flown left hand traffic, unless the airfield traffic pattern indicators or FLIP depict otherwise.  No tactical patterns will be flown. 3.16.3.9.  Except  for  climbout  after  takeoff,  the  maximum  airspeed  for  operations  at  an uncontrolled airfield is 200 KIAS. 3.16.3.10.  Instrument  approaches  will  be  flown  under  an  IFR  clearance,  unless  waived IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3.  If cleared to switch to CTAF or IFR cancellation occurs,   28  AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015 radio  calls  will  be  made  to  report  the  final  approach  fix  or  inbound  segment  of  the approach; and upon termination or completion of the approach. 3.16.3.10.1.  Instrument approaches may be flown at non-LOA uncontrolled airfields for  the  purposes  of  descending  below  the  weather  to  cancel  IFR  and  proceed  VFR (e.g., to facilitate entering a military training route). 3.16.3.11.  Aircrews  will  immediately  notify  the  supervisor  of  flying  if  any  hazardous conditions exist at an uncontrolled airfield that would prevent normal operations. 3.16.3.12.  Aircrews  should  refer  to  FAA  AIM,  Traffic  Advisory  Practices  at  Airports Without Operating Control Towers, for more information regarding uncontrolled airfield operations. AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015   29  Chapter 4 OPERATING RESTRICTIONS 4.1.  Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy: 4.1.1.  Missions originating from the home station should not normally launch with a known malfunction.    Official  aircraft  status  is  determined  IAW  AFI  21-103,  Equipment  Inventory, Status  and  Utilization  Reporting.    However,  aircraft  commanders  may  utilize  the  MEL (Table  4.1)  to  determine  the  acceptability  of  an  aircraft  for  a  mission  without  further approval. (T-2). 4.1.2.  It  would  be  impractical  to  prepare  a  list  that  would  anticipate  all  possible combinations of equipment malfunctions and contingent circumstances.  The MEL identifies the minimum equipment and systems required to launch the aircraft under normal conditions.  The  MEL  represents  MAJCOM  restrictions  only  and  does  not  include  all  equipment  or systems essential to airworthiness, e.g., rudder, elevator, flaps, ailerons, tires, etc.  Consider equipment and/or systems with no listed exceptions as grounding items. (T-2). 4.1.3.  The aircraft commander is responsible for exercising the necessary judgment to ensure the  aircraft  is  not  accepted  with  inoperative  equipment  or  systems  that  may  result  in  an unsafe  degradation  and/or  an  undue  increase  in  crew  workload.    The  aircraft  commander shall  account  for  the  possibility  of  additional  failures  during  continued  operation  with inoperative systems or components.  The MEL is not intended for continued operation over an indefinite period with systems and/or subsystems inoperative. (T-2). 4.1.4.  Once  airborne,  aircraft  commanders  must  weigh  all  pertinent  factors  when  deciding whether  to  continue  or  abort  a  sortie  for  an  aircraft  malfunction.    Factors  include  weather conditions at home base and divert base, student’s mission requirements, etc. (T-2). 4.1.5.  Operations  group  commanders  may  waive  restrictions  listed  in  the  MEL  or  unlisted items and/or equipment on a flight-by-flight basis if there is no compromise of flight safety or  Air  Force  directives.    This  authority  may  not  be  delegated  below  the  deputy  group commander. (T-3). Table 4.1.  T-1A Minimum Equipment List (Excluding functional check flight [FCF]).

Note:  Brief  items  applicable  to  the  mission  in  sufficient  detail  to  prevent  any misunderstanding  between  crewmembers.    “Knock-It-Off”  (KIO)  and  “Terminate”  are  terms used between aircraft during formation, air refueling, and air intercept operations.  “Time-Out” is used by any crewmember within individual aircraft. A7.2.  Knock-It-Off  (KIO)  Situations.    KIO  will  be  called  when  safety  of  flight  is  a  factor. Situations requiring a KIO include: A7.2.1.  A dangerous situation is developing. A7.2.2.  An unbriefed or unscheduled flight enters the working area and is detrimental to the safe conduct of the mission. A7.2.3.  Weather is below minimums for the area or route. A7.2.4.  Any  aircraft  exceeds  maneuvering  limits  such  that  safety  of  flight  is  compromised (for example, over G, min airspeed, etc.). A7.2.5.  Loss of Situational Awareness. A7.3.  Knock-It-Off Actions: A7.3.1.  Acknowledge with call sign. A7.3.2.  Clear flight path. A7.3.3.  Cease maneuvering and climb and/or descend to a safe altitude. A7.3.4.  Maintain visual. A7.4.  Terminate  Situations.  Terminate will be used to discontinue maneuvering when safety of flight is not a factor. Situations requiring a Terminate include: A7.4.1.  BINGO fuel is reached. A7.4.2.  When desired learning objectives are met or are unattainable. A7.4.3.  Exceeding area boundaries. A7.4.4.  Below  minimum  altitude  or  within  minimum  range  which  does  not  compromise safety. A7.4.5.  Out  of  position  (offset  maneuvering  cone,  cell,  etc.)  with  no  expectation  of expeditious return to position. A7.5.  Terminate Actions: A7.5.1.  Acknowledge with call sign. A7.5.2.  Clear flight path. A7.5.3.  Cease maneuvering and climb and/or descend to a safe altitude. A7.5.4.  Maintain visual.   56  AFI11-2T-1V3  16 JULY 2015 A7.6.  Time-Out Situations.  “Time-Out” is the common assertive statement for use by all crew members. The use of “Time-Out” will: A7.6.1.  Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness. A7.6.2.  Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs. A7.6.3.  Notify  all  crewmembers  when  someone  sees  the  aircraft  or  crew  departing  from established  guidelines,  the  briefed  scenario,  or  that  someone  is  simply  uncomfortable  with the developing conditions. A7.7.  Time-Out Actions.  As soon as possible after a “Time-Out” has been called, the aircrew will take the following actions: A7.7.1.  Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft and ensure terrain clearance. A7.7.2.  The initiating crewmember will voice their concerns to the crew. A7.7.3.  The  PIC  will  provide  all  other  crewmembers  with  the  opportunity  to  voice  inputs relative to the stated concerns. A7.7.4.  After considering all inputs, the PIC will direct the course of action. A7.8.  Separation  of  Aircraft.  Aircraft  flying  the  offset  maneuvering  exercise  inside  the minimum range of 600 feet or forward of the 3/9 line will call “KNOCK-IT-OFF.” A7.9.  Lost  Sight/Blind  (N/A  -  Cell  Formation).  Maneuver  away  from  lead’s  last  known position and transmit “blind” with (altitude).  Lead will be directive to ensure altitude separation.  If in IMC, initiate lost wingman procedures.
