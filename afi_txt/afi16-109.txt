Overview.  Changes  in  the  international  security  environment  and  the  nature  of  threats  to U.S. national security continue to increase the range of potential conflict  zones and expand the number  of  potential  coalition  partners  with  whom  U.S.  forces  will  engage.  In  addition,  the  Air Force’s  “global  footprint”  and  enduring  commitment  to  its  identity  as  an  Expeditionary  Air, Space,  and  Cyberspace  Force  reinforce  the  reality  that  future  missions  will  require  personnel with a more sophisticated understanding of the international security environment. The Air Force established the International Affairs Specialist Program to meet these challenges by deliberately developing  a  cadre  of  Airmen  with  international  insight,  foreign  language  proficiency,  cultural understanding, and political-military savvy. Air Force International Affairs Specialists combine professional  military  skills  with  an  intimate,  nuanced  understanding  of  the  history,  language, culture,  and  political-military  issues  of  the  countries  and  regions  in  which  the  Air  Force  may operate. They employ this unique combination of knowledge and skills to understand the specific regional context in which air, space, and cyberspace power may be applied, in order to integrate this  understanding  into  plans  and  operations,  and  build  effective  relationships  with  our  global partners--relationships  which  are  increasingly  important  critical  enablers  for  our  Expeditionary Air, Space and Cyberspace Force. 1.2.  International  Affairs  Specialist  (IAS)  Program.  The  IAS  Program  is  the  Air  Force program  that  deliberately  develops  officers  with  unique  international  skills  to  fill  a  variety  of important positions worldwide. The IAS program has two components; the Foreign Area Officer and  Political-Military  Affairs  Strategist.  Fully  consistent  with  the  force  development  concepts, officers  are  typically  identified  at  the  mid-career  point  for  deliberate  development  in  the  IAS program.  These  officers  will  be  carefully  managed  to  remain  viable  and  competitive  in  their primary Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) while developing a strong foundation in international affairs. (T-1) 1.2.1.  Foreign  Area  Officer  (FAO).  The  FAO  program,  formerly  the  Regional  Affairs Strategist  (RAS)  program,  is  a  DoD-mandated  requirement  to  deliberately  develop  officers with  regional  knowledge,  experience  and  expertise,  as  well  as  language  skills.    FAO development  typically  begins  in  the  7-10  year  commissioned  service  window  but  some developmental  opportunities  exist  as  part  of  Intermediate  Developmental  Education  (IDE) and Senior Developmental Education (SDE).  Officers designated for FAO development will complete  foreign  language  training,  embark  on  an  in-region  immersion,  and  earn  a regionally-focused graduate degree to gain a detailed knowledge of regional history, culture, language,  and  political-military  affairs.  They  will  then  embark  upon  a  well-managed  dual-track career path,  alternating between FAO and core career field  assignments.  Assignments in the officer’s core specialty, when possible, will be complementary to the FAO’s regional specialization.    Typically,  FAOs  serve  overseas  in  language-coded  billets,  bringing international affairs skills to bear in high-visibility, high-impact jobs for the U.S. Air Force, Joint, Interagency, and Intergovernmental staffs. NOTE:  There is no deliberate development venue for ARC officers. AFI16-109  11 JULY 2017 5 1.2.2.  Political-Military  Affairs  Strategist  (PAS).  PAS,  a  one-time,  career-broadening assignment,  exposes  officers  to  political-military  affairs.  This  service-specific  program typically  begins  in  conjunction  with  IDE.  Selected  officers  acquire  a  broad  knowledge  of political-military  affairs  through  developmental  education  and  subsequently  serve  in  one developmental  assignment  to  gain  political-military  experience.  PAS  officers  develop  a unique skill set that translates across AFSCs, garnering a strong understanding of interagency partnerships key to operations in the irregular warfare domain. They typically serve on U.S. Headquarters staffs where their broad knowledge of political military affairs allows them to be effective action officers. 6 AFI16-109  11 JULY 2017 Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Program  Information.  The  Foreign  Area  Officer  and  the  Political-Military  Affairs Strategist programs are secondary career fields for Line of the Air Force officers. SAF/IA serves as the Functional Authority, while SAF/IAP is the Functional Manager. The SAF/IAPA Director serves as the Career Field Manager. 3.2.  General  Requirements.  IAS  officers  must  be  qualified  in  a  primary  Air  Force  career specialty,  remain  eligible  for  worldwide  deployment  or  assignment,  and  be  eligible  for  Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmentalized Information clearance upgrades. (T-1). 3.3.  Application  and  Selection.  Under the  IAS Program,  DTs will vector active duty officers for IAS development at the mid-career point (7-12 years commissioned service). Please refer to IAS portal page (www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/air-foce-ias) for application instructions. (T-1) 3.3.1.  FAO.    Officers  are  typically  selected  for  FAO  development  within  the  7-10  year commissioned  service  window,  but  some  developmental  opportunities  exist  as  part  of  the foreign  language  Overseas  Developmental  Education  (at  both  the  IDE  and  SDE  level)  and with  the  Mansfield  Fellowship  and  Olmsted  Scholarship.  Interested  line  officers  must indicate  a  desire  for  FAO  development  on  their  Airman  Development  Plan  (ADP);  ARC officers will do the same on the Reserve Officer Development Plan (R-ODP) or equivalent. The  comments  section  of  the  ADP  must  include  the  officer’s  Defense  Language  Aptitude Battery (DLAB) score and, if applicable, Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) scores. DLAB  scores  are  mandatory  for  selection  to  FAO  development.  Officers  may  list  regional and  language  preferences,  but  must  include  the  statement  “I  agree  to  accept  any  FAO developmental  opportunity  offered  and  am  a  volunteer  for  worldwide  deployment  or assignment.”  Officers  must  ensure  they  have  achieved  the  minimum  DLAB  score  (see Attachment  2).  Core  AFSC  Functional  Managers  will  review  ADPs  and  select  the  most qualified officers for FAO development. (T-1). 3.3.1.1.  Direct Utilization (DU). DU is an option for officers who are fully qualified for FAO certification and require no additional development. SAF/IAPA will hold a biannual DU  board  chaired  by  the  IAS  CFM.  The  board  will  verify  the  officer’s  career  field release and select qualified officers to fill FAO career field requirements. (T-1) 3.3.2.  PAS.  Officers  are  selected  for  PAS  development  typically  within  the  10-12  year commissioned  service  window  in  conjunction  with  IDE,  but  some  developmental opportunities  exist  as  part  of  the  English-speaking  Overseas  Developmental  Education  (at both the IDE and SDE level) and the Foreign Policy Advisor (POLAD) Fellowship.  Officers should indicate a desire for PAS development on their Airman Development Plan (ADP). Air Force  Reserve  (AFR)  officers  should  utilize  the  R-ODP  or  equivalent  to  communicate  a desire  for  PAS  development.  DTs  will  vector  officers  for  developmental  education.  The Developmental  Education  Designation  Board  (DEDB)  will  designate  officers  for  a  PAS development  program.  AFR  officers  will  be  considered  for  PAS  development  programs based on the program for which they are selected.  AFI16-109  11 JULY 2017 9 3.3.2.1.  DU.    Line  of  the  Air  Force  Development  Teams  may  fill  a  percentage  of  their annual PAS quota with officers in the grade of O-4 or O-5 who have expressed a strong desire for PAS duty and hold an International Relations degree. SAF/IAPA will establish the portion of the overall annual quota to be filled by DU and hold an annual DU board chaired  by  the  IAS  CFM.  The  board  will  verify  the  officer’s  career  field  release  and select the most qualified officers. 3.4.  Education  and  Training.  RegAF officers  selected for deliberate development  in  the  IAS Program  will  receive  appropriate  formal  education  and  training.  SAF/IAPA  will  match  FAO candidates  to  annual  education  and  training  allocations.  The  ARC  will  typically  select  officers with  pre-existing  FAO  skills  (i.e.,  a  regionally  focused  master’s  degree  and  professional-level proficiency in one of the dominant languages in their regions of expertise), who are able to fill FAO billets without additional education and training. ARC DT Boards will provide appropriate vectors to members who express a desire in their R-ODP or equivalent to enter the IAS program. (T-1) 3.4.1.  FAO.    Officers  selected  for  FAO  development  will  complete  a  regionally-focused advanced academic program (such as Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), the Olmsted Scholar Program,  the  Mansfield  Fellowship  Program,  or  foreign-speaking  foreign  I/SDE),  will become proficient in one of the dominant languages in their regions of expertise, will serve at least  6 months in  the country/region  of specialty, and will  complete the  Joint  Foreign  Area Officer  I  course  offered  in  Monterey,  CA  biannually.  If  an  officer  is  not  vectored  for deliberate  development,  SAF/IAPA  can  still  approve  Tuition  Assistance  (TA)  for  a  second Master’s Degree, in accordance with AFI36-2649, Air Force Voluntary Education. 3.4.1.1.  Advanced Academic Degree.  Officers who do not already possess a regionally focused advanced academic degree will complete one of the following programs:  Naval Postgraduate  School,  Olmsted  Scholar  Program,  Mansfield  Fellowship  Program,  or Foreign I/SDE. 3.4.1.1.1.  Constructive  Credit  Waiver  (CCW).    When  an  officer  has  significant experience in international affairs/relations providing specific knowledge of a foreign country, region, or geographic area, SAF/IAPA may decide to submit a waiver in lieu of  the  graduate  degree  requirement.  Experience  should  include  at  least  weekly interaction with host nation military or civilian personnel in the target language and a minimum  assignment  of  24  months  (non-austere)  or  12  months  in  an  austere environment (traditional drilling reserve periods do not meet this intent).  Experience conducting  Building  Partner  Capacity  (BPC),  Security  Cooperation,  Security  Force Assistance  (SFA),  Humanitarian  Assistance/Disaster  Relief  (HA/DR),  Liaison  or Advisor to Host Nation (HN) activities are among the types of qualifying experiences that  SAF/MR  will  consider  for  waivers  to  the  Grad  Edu  requirement.    Specific assignments  that  meet  this  intent  include  Defense  Attaché  (DATT),  Air  Attaché (AIRA), Security Cooperation Officer (SCO), Afghanistan/Pakistan (AFPAK) Hands, Ministry  of  Defense  Advisor  (MoDA),  FAO,  Bilateral  Affairs  Officer  (BAO),  and civilian  equivalents,  to  include  Foreign  Service  Officer  (FSO)  and  the  following Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  civilian  series:  Foreign  Affairs  Series (0130);  International  Relations  Series  (0131);  and  International  Cooperation  Series (0136). 10 AFI16-109  11 JULY 2017 3.4.1.2.  Foreign  Language  Proficiency.    Officers  who  are  not  already  proficient  in  at least one of the dominant languages in their regions of expertise will attend the Defense Language  Institute  (DLI)  or  other  designated  institution  for  foreign  language  training. FAO  officers  shall  maintain  language  proficiency,  as  a  minimum,  at  the  Interagency Language  Roundtable  (ILR)  2  level  of  proficiency  in  two  or  more  modalities  on  the DLPT and/or Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI). 3.4.1.3.  In-Region Experience.  To become fully-qualified under OSD guidelines, FAOs must  have  duty  experience  of  not  less  than  six  months  (preferably  one  year)  in  the country/region  of  specialty,  involving  significant  interaction  with  host-nation  nationals and/or  host-nation  entities  in  the  foreign  countries  or  regions  in  which  they  specialize. Significant interaction involves working directly with host-nation entities (such as study abroad,  as  a  military  exchange  officer,  as  a  student  at  an  in-country  school,  or  as  a security  assistance  officer),  in  order  to  gain  an  in-depth  understanding  of  the  language and culture of the country and region. For deliberately developed FAOs, SAF/IAPA will fund  and  arrange,  in  coordination  with  the  Air  Force  Culture  and  Language  Center (AFCLC),  the  In  Region  Training  (IRT),  which  includes  in-country  transportation (directly related to program activities), airfare, lodging (hotel, dormitory, or home-stay), language  classes,  books  and  materials,  visas,  and  meals.  FAOs  will  be  on  official  TDY orders for the duration of their IRT. (T-1). 3.4.1.4.  Joint  Foreign  Area  Officer  Level  I  Course.    This  in-residence  course  offered biannually on the Presidio of Monterey provides newly assessed FAOs and their spouses with an orientation to the FAO career field. Attendance at this course is coordinated with SAF/IAPA, and includes briefings from Senior FAOs and other experts on a wide array of topics.  FAOs who weren’t able to attend while in Monterey will get the opportunity to attend at a later date. In the event a FAO has already served in an in-region RAS billet, this requirement will be considered fulfilled. 3.4.2.  PAS.    Officers  selected  for  PAS  development  will  complete  a  political-military oriented IDE program as designated by the DEDB or RDEDB as applicable. These programs include, but  are not  limited to,  Air Command and Staff College (ACSC) with  the Political- Military  Affairs  Strategist  specialization,  English-speaking  foreign  IDE  &  SDE  programs, and the USAF POLAD Fellowship. (T-1) 3.4.2.1.  ACSC-PAS.  Officers will participate in the normal ACSC curriculum, but will take two PAS-approved electives and attend a series of SAF/IAPA-sponsored lectures. 3.4.2.2.  English-Speaking  Overseas  Developmental  Education  (ODE).    IDE  and  SDE programs  in  foreign  nations  where  the  school  is  conducted  in  English  and  SDE-equivalent  programs  such  as  the  Geneva  Centre  for  Security  Policy-International Training, the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies Course, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Defense College-Senior Course. 3.4.2.3.  POLAD  Fellowship.    The  goal  of  the  POLAD  Fellowship  is  to  increase interagency  capability  within  the  Air  Force  by  training  mid-level  officers  and  fielding qualified  advisors  for  Senior  Leaders.  Under  the  auspices  of  the  Office  of  the  Foreign Policy  Advisor  (SAF/IA-POLAD),  Headquarters,  United  States  Air  Force,  POLAD Fellows  develop  regional  expertise  and  interagency  capacity  working  at  the  State Department  and  through  coursework  at  Georgetown  University.  Regionally-focused AFI16-109  11 JULY 2017 11 studies  (e.g.  the  Middle  East,  Europe,  Asia/Pacific,  Africa,  and  Latin  America)  aim  to prepare the candidate for their follow-on assignment. Fellows will also gain exposure to foreign  policy  and  defense  policy  issues  that  require  interagency  coordination  (e.g. counterterrorism, security cooperation, humanitarian aid, etc.). 3.4.2.4.  Selected International Relations graduate degrees may, on a case-by-case basis, be considered as fulfilling the PAS development pipeline requirement. 3.5.  Utilization.  Officers vectored for IAS development will servein appropriate developmental assignments. (T-1) 3.5.1.  FAO.    Officers  selected  for  FAO  development  will  enter  a  dual-track  career  path, serving  in  a  FAO  utilization  tour  immediately  following  training,  and  then  alternating between primary career field and FAO assignments for the remainder of their careers. Many FAO assignments are overseas, and several are unaccompanied. Assignments in the officer’s core  specialty,  when  possible,  will  be  complementary  to  the  FAO  officer’s  regional specialization.  AFPC  OATs  and  DTs  will  carefully  manage  this  dual-track  career  path  to ensure officers remain viable and competitive for promotion in their primary AFSC. 3.5.1.1.  Olmsted  Scholar  Follow-On  Assignments.    Officers  selected  for  the  Olmsted Scholarship Program will be designated as a FAO. Immediate follow-on assignments for Olmsted  graduates  will  be  worked  on  a  case-by-case  basis  focused  on  the  needs  of  the Air  Force.  AFPC  OATs  and  DTs  will  carefully  manage  this  dual  career  path  to  ensure officers remain competitive in both their primary AFSC and RAS career fields. 3.5.1.2.

PAS  officers  will  normally  serve  in  an  international  Political-Military  Affairs assignment  on  their  first  or  second  post-IDE  assignment.  Additional  developmental opportunities  may  be  available  as  determined  by  the  officer’s  core  career  field  DT  and  the needs of the Air Force. 3.6.  Skills  Sustainment.  These  programs  are  designed  to  maintain  and  enhance  the  foreign language skills and cultural awareness of RegAF IAS officers. They support guidance contained in  CORONA taskers, DoDI 1315.20, the Air Force  Language  Flight  Plan, and the Quadrennial Defense Review.  Individuals  taking part in  this training  are volunteers and must obtain release through  appropriate  supervisory  channels.  FAOs  must  ensure  they  maintain  professional  level proficiency  in  their  region  and  language  while  alternating  between  core  career  field  and  FAO assignments. SAF/IAPA will be responsible for tracking and managing FAOs’ cultural, regional and language capabilities as well as coordinating annual training plans for FAOs.  All FAOs are required  to  accomplish  at  least  40  hours  annually  of  language  and/or  cultural  training.    On  a funds available basis, SAF/IAPA will sponsor a portion of this requirement. (T-1). 3.6.1.  Defense Language Proficiency Test.  FAOs must maintain language proficiency at the ILR  2  level  in  their  regional  language  as  outlined  in  paragraph  3.4.1.2.  and  are  required  to take a DLPT and OPI annually or biennially IAW AFI 36-4002.  For FAOs who are assigned to a duty location where language proficiency testing is unavailable, refer to AFI 36-4002 for waiver process.  . Failure to meet this requirement will result in reduction or loss of FLPB as described  in  AFI  36-4002,  and  may  hinder  future  progression  as  a  FAO.  SAF/IAPA  will support its FAOs in attaining and/or maintaining the minimum DLPT and OPI score required by  providing  the  most  updated  language  resources  database  and/or,  as  the  program  budget allows, fund participation in language enhancement venues. (T-0). 3.6.2.  Language Enhancement Programs.  SAF/IA will develop and administer programs to help  maintain  and  enhance  the  foreign  language  proficiency  of  FAOs.  These  may  include, but are not limited to the following: 3.6.2.1.  Language and Area Studies Immersion Program (LASI).  LASI is a one-month intensive  area  studies  and  immersion  course  which  includes  classroom  instruction,  one- on-one tutoring, and cultural excursions to improve foreign language skills as well as an enhanced  understanding  of  the  host  country’s  culture  and  way  of  life.  Programs  are conducted in a wide variety  of languages both  overseas and, where  political  or security considerations dictate, through Continental United States (CONUS) isolation immersion. SAF/IA funds the LASI program (via contract), which includes in-country transportation (directly  related  to  program  activities),  airfare,  lodging  (hotel,  dormitory  or  home-stay), language classes, books and materials, visas, and meals. Officers will be on TDY orders for their LASI. 3.6.2.2.  Individual  Tutoring  Programs.    FAOs  may  be  eligible  for  one-on-one  foreign language  tutoring  on  a  funds-available  basis.  Officers  must  locate  a  U.S.  General Services Administration (GSA) approved service provider who accepts the Government-wide  Commercial  Purchase  Card  (GPC)  and  then  obtain  SAF/IA  approval,  prior  to enrolling. For application instructions, please reference the SAF/IAPA MilSuite page. (T-1) AFI16-109  11 JULY 2017 13 3.6.3.  Regional  Studies  Enhancement  Programs.    Because  the  international  security environment  is  dynamic,  FAOs  must  remain  current  on  the  political-military,  economic, social,  and  cultural  issues,  as  well  as  U.S.  policy  objectives  relevant  to  their  regional specialization.  SAF/IA  will  facilitate  FAO  application  to  and  attendance  at  programs designed  to  help  enhance  the  regional  expertise  of  FAOs.  These  may  include,  but  are  not limited  to,  area  studies  courses  at  the  United  States  Air  Force  Special  Operations  School (USAFSOS),  the  Foreign  Service  Institute  (FSI),  Joint  Foreign  Area  Officer  Courses,  and Regional  Security  Studies  Centers.  Air  Force  Reserve  officers  who  utilize  these  programs must comply with AFI 36-2254v1, Reserve Personnel Participation. (T-1) 3.6.4.  Eligibility.    Language  enhancement  and  enhanced  regional  studies  programs  are designed  and  administered  to  improve  the  foreign  language  proficiency  and  regional expertise  of  FAOs  as  they  alternate  between  core  career  field  and  FAO  assignments. Applicants must meet the following eligibility requirements: (T-1) 3.6.4.1.  All applicants must have a minimum of three years retainability. 3.6.4.2.  LASI  and  tutoring  applicants  must  have  a  current  DLPT  score  on  file.    FAOs with  scores  between,  and  including,  L1/R1/S1  and  L2+/R2+/S2+  in  the  language  of interest will have priority consideration. 3.6.4.3.  LASI  applicants  must  have  a  valid  tourist  passport  and  must  not  currently  be stationed  in  the  country  of  interest.  In  some  circumstances,  an  official  passport  may  be used; SAF/IAPA is the final decision authority on such requests. 3.6.5.  Application  Procedures.    SAF/IA  will  post  current  program  offerings  on  the International Airmen Division website. Officers interested in participating in these programs must  obtain  their  commander’s  approval  and  submit  an  application  (found  on  the International Airmen Division website, under IAS Program) to SAF/IAPA at least ten weeks prior to the course start date. (T-1) 3.6.6.  Application Processing.  SAF/IA will: 3.6.6.1.  Coordinate student registration with the contractor and submit country clearance requests as required. 3.6.6.2.  Notify  applicants  of  approval  or  disapproval  prior  to  the  course  start  date  and assist with publication of travel orders. 3.6.6.3.  Provide  approved  applicants  with  a  read-ahead  package  to  include  course information, student responsibilities, and after-action requirements. 14 AFI16-109  11 JULY 2017 Chapter 4 AIR FORCE SPECIALTY CODE CLASSIFICATION 4.1.
