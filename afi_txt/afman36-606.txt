Program  Authorities.  The  AF  fulfills  Civil  Service  Reform  Act  requirements  for executive management through a series of functionally-oriented CF programs. Each CF program is administered by a CFT located within the AFPC. The CFTs manage the careers of permanent officer-equivalent  civilians  within  their  CF  by  developing  highly  competent  leaders  through  a variety  of  training  and  developmental  programs.  Additionally,  the  CFT  provides  for  the systematic  development  of  potential  candidates  for  Senior  Executive  Service/Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service (SES/DISES) positions through various force development initiatives, to include participation in the Civilian Strategic Leader Program (CSLP) and KCPs. Additional  information  about  CFT  objectives,  structure  and  responsibilities  is  outlined  in  AFI 36-2640. 2.1.1.  Functional  Advisory  Councils  (FACs).  Functional  communities  establish  Advisory Councils chaired by the Functional Authority (FA), or designee, to address unique functional needs.  FAC  Chairs  may  further  designate  individuals  or  groups  to  carry  out  certain authorities. If so designated, a written record is maintained by the CFT. Groups (panels) may be  established  to  manage  such  areas  as  promotion  plans,  referral  issues,  positions,  training, leadership development, workforce analysis and overall program effectiveness. Panels meet on  a  regular  and  recurring  basis.  Specific  panels  may  be  addressed  in  the  individual  CF chapters within this Manual. 2.1.2.  DTs.  Senior  members  of  the  FAC  form  CF  DTs.  Refer  to  the  annual  Force Development/DT guidance for DT rank structure.  DTs provide mentoring and career advice to  members  of  the  CF  through  the  vectoring  process.    DTs  also  rate  candidates  for developmental  opportunities  such  as  Career  Broadening  (CB),  Civilian  Developmental Education (CDE), CSLP and/or KCPs. During this process, the DT evaluates the candidates’ records  to  determine  if  they  are  ready  for  these  developmental  programs.  The  DT  also provides  vectors  identifying  appropriate  follow-on  assignments  for  candidates  selected  to participate in CDE, Career Broadening (CB), KCPs and CSLP. 2.2.  General.  The  Functional  Manager  (FM)  or  designee  shall  establish  criteria  and  provide direction to CFTs on which positions will be centrally managed by the CF. CF centrally managed positions are either competitive or excepted service permanent appropriated fund positions in the General  Schedule  (GS),  and  their  equivalents  under  other  pay  systems  such  as  the  Defense Civilian  Intelligence  Personnel  Management  System  (DCIPS)  and  Acquisition  Demonstration and Laboratory Demonstration projects (AcqDemo, LabDemo). 2.3.  Coding  Positions.  The  Headquarters  AF  (HAF)  CFM  designates  centrally  managed positions  within  the  CF  unless  delegated  to  the  CFT.  The  installation’s  servicing  classification function  and  the  CFTs  at  AFPC  identify  centrally  managed  CF  positions  by  coding  and maintaining position data in the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS). These data fields  include  the  CF  Identifier,  CF  Type  and  Mobility.  Civilian  Personnel  Sections  (CPSs) and/or  the  servicing  classification  function  must  verify  CF  centrally  managed  coverage  before filling  vacancies.  (T-3).  The  CFT  and  servicing  CPS  conduct  periodic  position  reviews  to identify and correct erroneous position coding.   14  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 2.3.1.  Temporary  and  Term  Employees.  Temporary  and  Term  positions  are  not  centrally managed; therefore, central funding of PCS costs is not authorized. 2.3.2.  Over-hire Positions. Over-hire positions are not centrally managed; therefore, central funding of PCS costs is not authorized. All ART officer positions are centrally managed by the ART Officer Career Management Program (AOCMP). 2.3.3.  Reimbursable  Fund  Positions.  If  centrally  managed,  reimbursable  fund  positions  are eligible for centrally funded PCS. 2.4.  Position  Classification.  Except  as  noted  below,  positions  are  classified  by  offices maintaining  classification  authority  for  the  installation  or  organization,  to  include  servicing CPSs, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), AFPC, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI)  and  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  (AFRC)/A1C.  When  questions  of  consistency  or standardization  in  classification  arise,  AF/A1C  provides  guidance  and  assistance  to  AFPC, MAJCOMs and comparable personnel activities and CPSs. 2.4.1.  CB  and  Force  Renewal  Positions.    AFPC,  in  coordination  with  CFMs,  classifies  CB and force renewal (Student Intern, Recent Graduates, PALACE Acquire and COPPER CAP) positions  funded  through  the  Central  Salary  Account  (CSA).  Employees  accepting  a  CB developmental  assignment  agree  to  pursue  the  objectives  and  activities  specified  in  the developmental plan and core personnel document. Changes to the established core personnel document are not authorized for the duration of the CB assignment. 2.4.2.  Civilian  Strategic  Leader  Program  (CSLP).    CSLP  is  an  AF  Corporate  Career Development Program and a component of the talent management strategy for strategic level leaders.  The  CSLP  office  serves  as  the  focal  point  for  all  CSLP  positions,  facilitates  the selection board process and manages the assignment process in coordination with the CFTs. 2.5.  Restructuring  Positions.  Centrally  managed  positions  are  filled  at  the  full  performance level  unless  a  special  need  arises  requiring  filling  the  position  below  the  target  grade. Commanders/Civilian  Equivalents  will  ensure  that  requests  for  approval  to  accommodate  a special needs situation(s) are made in advance, in writing, with justification, and directed through the respective CFT to the FM or designee. (T-3).  The FM may delegate the authority to approve restructuring a centrally managed position to the respective CFM or CFT Chief. 2.5.1.  Restructured  positions  are  advertised  to  the  AF  standard  Area  of  Consideration (AOC):  DoD-wide,  Transfer,  Reinstatement,  Interagency  Career  Transition  Assistance  Plan (ICTAP), Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (VEOA),  Military Spouse  and Schedule A eligibles IAW 2.16.3. Area of Consideration (Competitive). 2.5.2.  The  CPS  and/or  classification  authority  ensures  any  restructured  position  remains properly coded to reflect the full performance, or target, grade and retains the appropriate CF designations  (Career  Field  Identification  (ID)  letter/number  (CFID),  CF  type  and  mobility reason). Section B – Workforce Development 2.6.  Strategic Planning.  CFTs provide assistance and information to the CFM, FM and FA on the  management  of  the  total  civilian  workforce,  including  college  recruitment,  employee development trends, hiring/promotion data, demographics, career progression and other relevant CF  information.  CFTs  also  oversee  the  data  management  of  the  civilian  CFs;  develop  and AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   15  conduct  studies  of  internal  and  external  civilian  CF  trends;  perform  civilian  CF  research, analyses and surveys; and manage the development of civilian strategic and business plans. 2.6.1.  The  objectives  of  civilian  workforce  development  are  to  create  a  strategy  to effectively  develop  leaders  to  meet  mission  requirements  and  efficiently  use  financial resources.  The workforce strategy is: 1) to identify capabilities and talent requirements; 2) to develop  a  management  framework  to  meet  force  renewal,  functional  and  corporate requirements; and 3) to ensure the framework is flexible enough across CFs to meet unique mission requirements. 2.6.2.  Efficient  use  of  AF  financial  resources  involves:    1)  identifying  the  framework  for executing financial resources/priorities, and 2) assessing an acceptable degree of risk and/or alternative funding. 2.7.  Tuition  Assistance  (TA).  TA  funds  tuition  and  course-related  fees  for  accredited  college and  university  courses.  It  is  distinguished  from  long-term  training  that  is  defined  as  training during duty hours of over 120 consecutive days. 2.7.1.  Civilian  Tuition  Assistance  Program  (CTAP).  AF  civilian  post-secondary  TA  is intended to support civilians in their continued self-development and includes coursework at the  associate,  bachelor  and  master  levels.  TA  is  for  courses  that  contribute  to  occupational and institutional competencies, special interest needs and readiness by supporting the current and  anticipated  needs  of  the  AF.  This  includes  courses  that  will  provide  employees  the breadth  of  knowledge  and  problem-solving  tools  that  aid  in  critical  thinking,  allowing individuals to address a wide range of problems and weigh alternative solutions. 2.7.2.  CTAP  is  voluntary  education,  not  training  identified  by  management.    It  is administratively  managed  through  the  AF  Automated  Education  Management  System (AFAEMS)  to  identify  and  approve  requests  and  obligate  resources.    Courses  that  are mandated by law or regulation as a job requirement and courses identified on training plans for AF interns are covered by AFI 36-601, Air Force Civilian Career Program Management, and AFI 36-602, Civilian Intern Programs. 2.7.3.  CTAP Rules. 2.7.3.1.  CTAP Eligibility.  TA is available to all permanent full-time appropriated fund employees  with  an  acceptable  performance  appraisal.

The  employee  also  must  be  taking  at  least  a  half-time academic course load (typically six credit hours or equivalent). computer 2.7.3.2.  CTAP  Funding.    TA  may  be  funded  through  DoD,  AF  Program  Element  (PE) 88751  or  MAJCOM,  installation,  center,  unit  and/or  organizational  resources.    The appropriate acquisition and DCIPS Intern Program funding source will support DAWIA and National Intelligence Program (NIP)-funded TA, respectively. 2.7.3.3.  Applicable CTAP Coursework Rules. 2.7.3.3.1.  TA  is  for  courses  that  contribute  to  occupational  and  institutional competencies,  special  interest  needs  and  readiness;  the  courses  support  the  current and anticipated needs of the AF. 2.7.3.3.2.  Courses must  be from a fully  accredited academic institution listed in the DoD Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) directory, i.e., a college/university that meets  regional  and/or  national  standards  as  defined  by  the  US  Department  of Education and listed in the DoD directory at http://dodmou.org. 2.7.3.3.3.  Courses  may  be  delivered  in  a  classroom  setting,  by  e-learning,  College Level  Examination  Program  (CLEP)  and/or  Defense  Activity  for  Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES) Subject Standardized Test (DSST) testing. 2.7.3.3.4.  Coursework  is  considered  employee-initiated  self-development  and  must be  completed  on  the  employee’s  personal  time.    In  cases  where  attendance  in approved  course  requires  the  employee  to  be  absent  from  the  duty  station  during normal alternative  work arrangements/schedules;  however,  the  employee  must  maintain  a  40-hour  per  week work schedule. supervisor  may approve duty hours, the 2.7.3.4.

Waiver  of  the non-DAWIA  semester,  quarter  hour  or  fiscal  year  cap  will  be  permitted  only  in cases  of  pending  assignment  to  a  remote  location  not  serviced  by  the  current academic in  course completion. institution,  which  will  cause  undue  hardship/delay 2.7.3.4.4.  Employees may use non-DAWIA TA in conjunction with Pell Grants, but may  not  use  it  in  conjunction  with  active  or  reserve  Military  TA  and/or  with Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (DVA)  educational  benefits,  or  with  any  federally-insured student loan. 2.7.3.4.5.  Non-DAWIA/DCIPS CTAP will not be used for courses that apply toward a  professional  goal  and/or  coursework  at  a  lower  or  equal  level  of  education  to  one already obtained. 2.7.3.4.6.  CTAP is not for the sole purpose of providing an employee the opportunity to  obtain  an  academic  degree.    If  in  the  accomplishment  of  CTAP  coursework  an employee  receives  an  academic  degree,  the  degree  is  considered  an  incidental  by-product. 2.7.3.4.7.  Non-DAWIA/DCIPS  CTAP  will  not  be  used  for  tuition  for  repeated courses or courses equivalent to course content already completed. 2.7.3.4.8.

CTAP  using  DAWIA,  NIP  and/or  non-DAWIA funding  is  not  a  guaranteed  employee  benefit/condition  of  employment,  nor  will  past approved tuition assistance guarantee future funding. 2.7.3.10.  CTAP  Records  Management.    DCPDS  is  the  official  record  for  all  completed civilian  training  and  CTAP.    Employees  should  use  MyBiz+  Self  Service  Education  to update DCPDS with completed course information. 2.8.  Palace Acquire (PAQ)/Copper Cap (COP) Intern Programs.  AFI 36-602 addresses the various  intern  programs  and  the  methods  and  procedures  for  recruiting,  selecting,  training, evaluating, promoting and separating CF interns. 2.9.  Leadership Development. 2.9.1.  Identification  of  Exceptional  or  High  Potential  Performers.  Centrally  managed  CF positions are considered potential “feeder” positions to qualify for application to higher level and  SES/DISES  positions.  CFs  may  develop  procedures  to  identify  exceptional  or  high potential  performers,  to  include:  guiding  and  monitoring  employee  training  consistent  with developmental  templates  or  their  career  path;  assuring  employees  have  gained  the  training, development and career growth experiences needed  for further advancement; and arranging career  enhancing  job  rotations,  details  and  special  project  assignments.  At  a  minimum,  and through  the  operation  of  their  respective  DTs,  each  CFT  will  nominate  high-potential candidates from within the CF for inclusion in Career Development Programs. 2.9.2.  Developmental  Templates.  The  AF  Civilian  Leadership  Development  Continuum  at Attachment 2 and the developmental templates depicted in the individual CF chapters reflect the  competencies  valued  by  the  AF  and  provide  a  clear  progression  model  from  entry  to senior leader levels. These guides clearly define the framework within which employees may plan their careers. Supervisors and managers are encouraged to use these tools when engaged in mentoring activities or discussing career opportunities with their subordinates. 2.10.  Career Development Positions.  There are two primary types of developmental positions: CB  and  career  enhancing.  Each  provides  developmental  work  experiences  intended  to  prepare employees for higher level supervisory and managerial positions. 2.10.1.  CB  Positions.  The  centrally  managed  CB  Program  is  an  integral  part  of  the  AF’s leadership  development  framework  depicted  in  the  AF  Civilian  Leadership  Development Continuum  included  at  Attachment  2.  It  is  designed  to  build  occupational  and  institutional competencies  while  enhancing  leadership  perspective.  The  program  is  an  integral  part  of structured development and is corporately managed. The primary focus of the program is to AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   19  develop current mid-level AF employees, typically GS-12 through GS-14 (and equivalents in other  appropriated  fund  pay  systems);  however,  in  certain  instances assignments  may  be  to positions  at  the  GS-15  and  equivalent  level  to  meet  specific  career  development requirements. Positions may also be within Joint and Combatant Commands, where the AF is the executive agent, under appropriate training agreements and directives; for example, other DoD  components  and  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  (OSD).  CB  assignments, although of relatively short duration, are sufficiently complex and demanding to increase and broaden  experience.  Assignments  may  be  between  specialties  or  disciplines  within  a  CF  or across  functional  lines  from  one  CF  to  another  where  skills  pairing  has  been  approved. (Note: Individual CF chapters in this directive may contain further details). 2.10.2.  Centrally Managed CB Program Positions. CB assignments can be used to facilitate employees gaining experiences at the operational and strategic levels. Within the operational arena,  assignments  should  focus  on  development  within  a  functional  community  to  gain breadth of experience (this could be accomplished across occupational lines within a single CF).  At  the  strategic  level,  CB  assignments  should  focus  on  HAF,  MAJCOM  or  Joint experience.  These  positions,  while  placed  at  an  organization  for  a  career  broadening assignment,  are  considered  to  be  overhead  positions  (not  part  of  the  local  Unit  Manning Document (UMD) or critical for accomplishment of the mission). As such, CB authorizations generally  are  not  to  be  used  to  establish  new  supervisory  positions  within  an  organization. DTs  or  CFMs  determine  position  location  and  work  assignments  to  accomplish  specific career  development  objectives;  therefore,  the  location,  occupational  series  and  grade/pay band level may change from one assignment to the next. 2.10.2.1.  Key Attributes of CB Program Positions. 2.10.2.1.1.  AFPC centrally manages and funds. 2.10.2.1.2.

Limited  in  duration,  normally  30-36  months;  the  FM  or  designee  and AFPC  must  approve  an  extension  of  up  to  an  additional  12  months.    Because  these positions are used for corporate development, Commanders/Civilian Equivalents will ensure that assignment duration is limited to a maximum of 48 months. (T-3). 2.10.2.1.6.  Filled  by  competitive  reassignment,  change  to  lower  grade/pay  band, temporary promotion or DT vectoring process utilizing approved ranking criteria. formal  development  plan 2.10.2.1.7.  A is  necessary.  Commanders/Civilian Equivalents  will  ensure  the  plan  outlines  the  knowledge,  skills,  abilities  and competencies  to  be  gained  through  the  career  broadening  assignment,  along  with methods of development, applicable references and estimated hours/months required for each competency. (T-3). 2.10.2.2.  Using DT Vectors to Fill Career Broadening Positions. 2.10.2.2.1.  At  the  direction  of  their  DT,  CFs  may  require  candidates  to  submit  a development  plan  and/or  résumé  as  part  of  the  CB  selection  process.  When  this   20  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 mechanism  is  used,  CFs  must  publicize  the  fact  that  opportunities  for  these  career broadening assignments are limited to those who submit a development plan and who receive  a  vector  from  the  DT.  Additionally,  if  these  CB  opportunities  are  open  to temporary promotion candidates, Commanders/Civilian Equivalents will ensure that a vacancy  announcement  is  posted  and  the  requirement  for  interested  employees  to submit a development plan and/or résumé is clearly stated in the body of the vacancy announcement. (T-3). The announcement should also direct applicants to contact their CF for specific information. 2.10.2.2.2.  CFs must ensure employees are made aware that the DT vector process is utilized.  At  a  minimum,  CFTs  must  accomplish  notification  using  multiple communication  methods  such  as:  vacancy  announcements,  list  servers,  newsletters, bulletin boards, websites, and any other available means. (T-3). 2.10.2.2.3.  Commanders/Civilian  Equivalents  will  ensure that  developmental objectives  for  individuals  selected  for  CB  assignment  are  clearly  identified,  and periodic  evaluations  of  progress  are  conducted  to  ensure  employees  meet  those objectives, per AFPC. (T-3). 2.10.2.2.4.  The designated selecting authority may make selections for CB positions from  a  competitive  certificate  of  promotion,  reassignment  and/or  change-to-lower-grade  eligibles.  In  these  instances,  the  CB  Program  Office  must  first  announce  the career  broadening  position  vacancy  through  the  normal  competitive  process  and establish a 90-day register from which to refer qualified candidates to the CFT. career broadening 2.10.2.3.  DoD  Priority  Placement  Program  (PPP)  Exemption.  Selections  made  for assignment  to  the  CB  program  are  exempt  from  the  PPP.  The  exemption  permits placement  into  a  CB  position  by  reassignment,  change-to-lower  grade/pay  band  or temporary  promotion.  Outplacements  by  reassignment  or  change-to-lower  grade/pay band are also exempt from clearing PPP for those who have completed a centrally funded and  managed position. Commanders/Civilian Equivalents will ensure a follow-on assignment is firmed up within the last six months of the career broadening assignment. (T-3).  This exemption does not apply  to  outplacement  actions  onto  permanent  positions  through  promotion;  therefore, Commanders/Civilian Equivalents will ensure the DoD Automated Stopper and Referral System (ASARS) is cleared for promotion actions. (T-3).  CB temporary promotion may lead to permanent promotion without further competition when a one-time clear of PPP has been accomplished before a follow-on assignment can be effected. This applies only when  full  AF-wide  competition  was  afforded  during  the  career  broadening  selection process. In each instance, the ASARS must be cleared prior to placement. assignment, follow-on to a 2.10.2.4.  CB  Outplacement.  Efforts  begin  one  (1)  year  prior  to  completion  of  the  CB program. Refer to AFI 36-2640 for specific guidance. Outplacement efforts involve one, or  a  combination,  of  the  activities  listed  below.  As  such,  DTs  and  CFTs  have  a responsibility  to  assess  AF-wide  goals,  needs  and  mission  requirements  within  their communities, and take an active role in seeking outplacement assignments for graduating CBs. 2.10.2.4.1.  Referral  and  selection  are  through  the  normal  centrally-managed competitive process. AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   21  2.10.2.4.2.  Management  Initiated  Reassignment.  The  CFT  will  continually  monitor existing/incoming CF fill requests for which the graduating CB was DT-vectored or is qualified  and  has  indicated  a  preference,  including  those  which  match  the occupational series and grade/bands identified in the career broadening Memorandum of  Agreement  (MOA).  After  identifying  a  match,  the  CFT  will  provide  a  CB-generated résumé to the selecting official for consideration. (T-3). 2.10.2.4.3.  CF  Proactive  Efforts.  Proactive  efforts  include,  but  are  not  limited  to, such  activities  as:  1)  informing  the  community  of  upcoming  graduating  CBs;  2) issuing  emails  to  functional  leaders  and  actively  marketing  the  types  of  series, grade/pay band levels and skills of the CBs; 3) sending out information bulletins on list-servers about program objectives, priority placement flexibilities and availability of  CBs  to  fill  projected  and  unanticipated  vacancies;  4)  involving  mentors  in  the outplacement process; and/or 5) outplacement vectoring by the DT. These are just a few options; the intent is to be assertive in using all the resources available in placing the next generation of civilian leaders. 2.10.2.4.4.  Finalizing  the  Outplacement.  Commanders/Civilian  Equivalents  will ensure a  placement is finalized and all necessary arrangements such as PCS orders, release date, new reporting date, etc. are settled and agreed to by all parties concerned within six months but no later than 60 days prior to the end of the CB assignment. (T-3). 2.10.2.4.5.  Commanders/Civilian  Equivalents  will  ensure  outplacement  from  a CONUS  CB  assignment  to  an  overseas  location  is  managed  IAW  AFMAN  36-204, Overseas  Employment.  The  CB  Office  will  initiate  the  appropriate  overseas employment  agreement  and  obtain  the  necessary  signatures,  provide  a  copy  to  the overseas CPS and retain the signed copy in the employee’s overseas folder in the CB Office. (T-3). 2.10.2.4.6.  Failure  to  accept  a  post-broadening  assignment  in  violation  of  the employee’s signed mobility agreement may result in the employee’s separation from the AF. 2.10.2.5.  Payment of Career Broadeners. 2.10.2.5.1.  Salary. Salaries for CBs are funded from the AF’s CSA. 2.10.2.5.2.  Annual  Performance  Awards.    Annual  performance  awards  are  funded from the CSA with instructions and administration of the funds conducted by the CB Program Office, Resource Office and the pay system's applicable reviewing authority. 2.10.2.5.3.  GS Performance Awards. Performance awards may take the form of time-off and/or monetary awards. Time-off awards may be approved by the supervisor for GS positions and so annotated as part of the appraisal package. 2.10.2.5.4.  GS  Quality  Step  Increases  (QSIs).  QSIs  are  not  authorized  in  the  CB program because it is a developmental program. CB positions are designed to broaden the  skills  of  high  potential  AF  employees  for  future  leadership  positions.  These developmental positions normally last between 30-36 months (with a maximum of 48   22  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 months)  and  are  accompanied  by  formal  developmental  plans.  The  individual  is expected to be learning and developing his/her skills during that period of time. 2.10.2.5.5.  GS  Incentive  Awards.  Monetary  incentive  awards  are  processed  and approved locally, and paid out of the local installation’s funds. The AFPC CSA pays the  incentive  award  for  the  CB;  however,  the  organization  granting  an  incentive award  to  a  CB  must  contact  the  AFPC/FM  Resources  Section  to  complete  the necessary transfer of funds to reimburse the CSA. (T-2). 2.10.2.5.6.  Overtime.  The  CSA  does  not  fund  overtime  payments;  the  local installation will fund any required overtime. The organization granting overtime must contact  AFPC/FM  Resources  Section  to  complete  the  necessary  transfer  of  funds  to the CSA. (T-3). 2.10.2.5.7.  PCS Costs. The central PCS account funds PCS for employees, with the exception of ART officers, moving into and out of CB positions. If the outplacement from a CB position outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) is not to a CF centrally  managed  position,  PCS  entitlements  may  be  limited.  (See  paras.  2.22.  and 2.23.) 2.10.2.6.  CB  Assignments  Overseas.  Employees  accepting  a  CB  assignment  at  an overseas location must sign an Overseas Return Agreement IAW AFMAN 36-204. 2.10.3.  Career Enhancing Positions. Career Enhancing positions are a permanent part of an organization’s  infrastructure  and  are  centrally  managed  separately  by  each  CF.  These  are time-limited with continuing work assignments, and they normally involve work that is AF-wide  in  scope,  responsibility  and  complexity.  Key  attributes  of  career  enhancing  positions include: 2.10.3.1.  Centrally managed. 2.10.3.2.  Established against positions on the local UMD (locally owned and funded). 2.10.3.3.  Personnel servicing provided locally (same as other local positions). 2.10.3.4.  Require an AF-wide mobility agreement as determined by each CF. 2.10.3.5.  Limited in duration as determined by the CF, normally two to three years. 2.10.3.6.  May be filled through any appropriate, competitive staffing procedure. 2.10.4.  CSLP.  The  overarching  goal  of  CSLP  is  to  develop  selected  GS-14s/15s  or equivalents  through  challenging  leadership  assignments  with  roles  and  responsibilities  that have AF enterprise and/or DoD-wide impact. 2.10.4.1.  Eligibility.  To  be  eligible  for  CSLP,  employees  must  meet  the  following criteria: 2.10.4.1.1.  Currently  be  assigned  to,  or  previously  held,  a  permanent  GS-14  or  15 position. (This is not a promotion program/opportunity). 2.10.4.1.2.  Have at least 12 months in the current position. 2.10.4.1.3.  Have at least 12 months of supervisory experience. 2.10.4.1.4.  Have a Bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution. AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   23  2.10.4.1.5.  Not have previously held a CSLP leadership position of the same type at the GS-14 or 15 grade levels. A waiver may be requested and coordinated through the CSLP office and functional DT, then approved by the Deputy AF/A1. 2.10.4.1.6.  Employees wishing to apply for CSLP positions should be referred to the myPers website. 2.10.4.2.  Assignment opportunities. 2.10.4.2.1.  Installation Level Positions.  Normally these positions are funded by the MAJCOMS and/or the installation (i.e., Wing Executive Director and Group Deputy Directors). 2.10.4.2.2.  Headquarters Air Force Level Positions. Positions are funded by the CSA and  are  located  within  the  Headquarters  AF.  These  positions  are  critical  to  shaping the future of the AF through policy development and program management. 2.10.4.2.3.  Joint Level Positions. Positions are funded by the CSA and are located at the Joint Staff or Combatant Command. These positions are often directly involved in supporting  issues  of  national  security  and  require  interaction  with  all  levels  of  the Department of Defense. They may aid in shaping Department-wide policy and/or may participate in the planning, programing, budget and execution process. 2.10.4.3.  Annual  Process  Overview.    There  are  four  major  components  to  the  CSLP annual process. 2.10.4.3.1.  Position  Validation.  CSLP  positions  will  be  identified  by  AFPC  using both  manpower  data  and  coordination  with  the  MAJCOMs,  HAF,  and  Joint  and COCOM  organizations.    All  civilian  Wing  Executive  Director  and  Group  Deputy Director positions should be filled using this program.  Each year, AFPC will validate the list of upcoming vacancies based on previous assignment of a CSLP participant to the position. (T-2).  All positions identified as open for fill in the CY are added to a list as available for the next year’s program.  The Civilian Force Development Panel (CFDP)  will  validate  the  position  list  annually.  (T-2).    Requests  to  add  or  delete  a CSLP  position  are  coordinated  through  the  CSLP  office  and  AF/A1D.  The  final approval authority for all additions or deletions is the Deputy AF/A1. 2.10.4.3.2.  Member Identification, Screening and Application. AFPC will conduct an open  call  for  CSLP  candidates  and  task  DTs  to  identify  potential  placement  of  GS-14/15  candidates  based  on  the  list  of  projected  vacancies  and  requirements  of  the position.  If  the  CSLP  call  does  not  produce  a  sufficient  number  of  candidates,  the CSLP Selection Board will solicit other nominees for consideration. Individuals who are  nominated  may  opt  out  of  consideration  with  no  penalty;  however,  feedback  on why they chose not to compete should be collected. 2.10.4.3.3.  Member  Boarding.  All  members  who  are  vectored  by  the  DT  will  meet the  CSLP  Selection  Board.  The  Board  will  make  recommendations  for  CSLP placement at HAF, Joint, COCOM or installation.  (See 2.10.4.2.) (T-2). 2.10.4.3.4.  Candidate  Matching.  After  the  Board  results  are  approved,  the  CSLP office will review the list of vacancies against the list of candidates approved by the   24  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 Developmental Education Designation Board (DEBD) and coordinate the assignment with the hiring officials. 2.10.4.4.  DTs must: 2.10.4.4.1.  Review/vector all potential GS-14/15 candidates. 2.10.4.4.2.  Screen  members  for  suitability  and  ensure  candidates  are  ready  for experiential development. 2.10.4.4.3.  Nominate identified members to the CSLP Selection Board. 2.10.4.4.4.  Identify the follow-on assignment. 2.10.4.5.  CSLP Assignment Overview. CSLP candidates who have been selected and are awaiting assignment are considered CSLP selects and are in the select pool for up to two years or  until they accept  a CSLP assignment.   If they do not  get an assignment by the two-year point, they will be asked to reapply for the next CSLP Board. 2.10.4.5.1.  Assignment  Process.    A  CSLP  slate  is  used  to  refer  a  list  of  names  of CSLP selects to the hiring official.  A valid slate consists of three or more candidates.  Selects  will  only  be  slated  for  positions  at  their  current  grade  and  for  the  positions identified  for  them  by  the  Selection  Board,  i.e.,  Joint,  COCOM,  HAF  and/or Installation at GS-14 or GS-15. 2.10.4.5.1.1.  CSLP selects may opt-in or opt-out of up to two assignments while waiting to be slated.  If the select opts out of a third assignment, the employee will be  removed  from  the  program  and  levied  a  five-year  penalty.  If,  after  being referred to the hiring official, the employee declines the interview or, if selected, declines  the  assignment,  the  employee  will  be  removed  from  the  program  and levied a five-year penalty. (See 2.10.4.8) 2.10.4.5.1.2.  If  there  are  no  CSLP  selects  available,  or  if  the  slate  has  less  than three  boarded  candidates  available,  the  CSLP  office  will  confer  with  the  CFTs.  There are three acceptable categories by which CFTs may identify candidates  to the  CSLP  office  in  the  following  order:    1)  Nominate  a  qualified  individual currently  attending  Senior  Development  Education  (SDE)  who  requires outplacement;  2)  identify  high-potential  reassignment  candidate(s)  from  a  DT-vetted  KCP  list  that  have  not  been  targeted  for  assignment;  or  3)  identify  high-potential  reassignment  candidates  graduating  from  the  CB  Program  who  are awaiting a follow-on assignment. 2.10.4.5.1.3.  Hiring officials must select from the slate provided by AFPC.  If the hiring official determines the candidate is not suitable for the position, they must request  an  exception  by  providing  a  strong  justification.      Requests  will  be processed  through  the  owning  installation’s  MAJCOM,  forwarded  to  the  CSLP office  and  forwarded  to  AF/A1D  for  coordination  and  Deputy  AF/A1  for approval. (T-3). 2.10.4.5.1.4.  When no CSLP candidates are available from the selection process, a  locally  funded  CSLP  position  may  be  filled  via  an  AF  internal  vacancy announcement. The servicing organization will announce the CSLP vacancy and issue  the  referral  certificate.  If  selected  via  an  open  vacancy  announcement,  the AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   25  member is  required to  sign  a CSLP  Mobility Agreement.   Commanders/Civilian Equivalents will ensure that CSA-funded CSLP positions are only filled through the approved board process. (T-3). 2.10.4.5.2.  Approval  Process.  The  Deputy  AF/A1  will  approve  any  deviation  from the slating process. (T-2). 2.10.4.6.  Mobility Requirements. Employees who are selected for a CSLP assignment by an  approved  DT  process  will  be  given  credit  as  being  CSLP  members.    Because  these positions rotate every three to four years, all candidates selected for CSLP positions must sign  a  Mobility  Agreement  (MOA)  and/or  a  participant  MOA  (for  Joint  assignments). (See  sample  civilian  mobility  MOA  at  figure  2.2.)    The  MOA  is  a  condition  of employment and must be signed by the employee prior to assignment. 2.10.4.7.  DoD  Priority  Placement  Program  (PPP)  Exemption.      A  selection  made  for  a CSLP  assignment  funded  by  Central  Salary  Account  (CSA)  is  not  subject  to  PPP clearance, based upon formal developmental and training purposes as provided by 5 CFR Part 410 (reference b). These selections are established for the sole purpose of providing corporate career broadening opportunities and for which there are no continuing mission requirements. 2.10.4.7.1.  The exemption permits placement onto a CSLP position by reassignment, or change to a lower grade/pay band.  Outplacements by reassignment or change-to-lower  grade/pay  band  to  a  follow-on  position  that  has  been  pre-identified  in  the employee‘s  formal  developmental  plan  or  memorandum  of  agreement  are  also exempt from clearing PPP for those who have completed a CSLP assignment. 2.10.4.7.2.  This exemption does not apply to the CSLP MAJCOM/Installation owned placement actions, as they are permanent in nature and subject to continuing mission requirements.  PPP  must  be  cleared  via  the  Automated  Stopper  and  Referral  System (ASARS)  IAW  the  PPP  handbook,  Chapter  4,  Matching  and  Filling  Positions.  PPP must also be cleared for follow-on assignments. 2.10.4.8.  CSLP  Deferments,  Withdrawals  and  Extensions.  The  Deputy  AF/A1  is  the approval  authority  for  all  deferment,  withdrawal  and  extension  requests.  Requests  for waivers will be considered on a case-by-case basis. They must be requested in writing by the  employee  and  contain  a  recommendation/endorsement  from  the  first  GO  or  SES  in the employee’s supervisory chain.  Next, the request will be routed and coordinated with the  applicable  CFM.    The  CSLP  office  requires  waiver  documentation  to  support withdrawal or declination prior to opting in or out of a current vacancy.  All withdrawals, declinations, waivers and extensions will be tracked and metrics reported each year to the CFDP. An employee  who is  relieved from duty  for cause, withdraws from the program without  approval  or  declines  a  CSLP  position  is  eliminated  from  the  program  unless  a waiver is approved.  Employees will be placed in a five-year penalty status from applying for  any  future  CSLP  opportunities  from  the  date  the  action  occurred  or  the  waiver  was denied. 2.10.4.8.1.  Deferment.    Management  and/or  individual  deferments  for  mission essential  or  humanitarian  reasons  for  a  CSLP  assignment  must  be  supported  with reasonable justification.  All deferment requests must be submitted when unforeseen   26  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 circumstances  arise,  not  when  a  CSLP  assignment  opportunity  is  offered  to  the member.  Requests will be routed through AFPC and approved by the Deputy AF/A1.  Requests  will  also  be  routed  and  coordinated  with  the  applicable  CFM.    Only  one approved  deferment  is  allowed  while  in  the  CSLP,  and  the  deferment  will  be  for  a specified  period  of  time  not  to  exceed  one  year  from  the  date  the  request  was approved.    Employees  who  do  not  opt-in  during  the  year  following  an  approved deferral  will  be  subject  to  the  appropriate  withdrawal  or  declination  policies.    The following are reasons for deferral: 2.10.4.8.1.1.  Mission  Essential.    The  Deputy  AF/A1  will  serve  as  approval authority for mission essential deferment considerations.  The approval authority will  normally  approve  a  mission  essential  deferment  if  the  employee’s  program participation would have an adverse mission impact.  Strong justification from the employee and the employee’s first GO/SES in the rating chain is required. 2.10.4.8.1.2.  Humanitarian.  The Deputy AF/A1 will serve as approval authority for  humanitarian  deferral  considerations.    The  approval  authority  will  normally approve  a  humanitarian  deferment  under  the  conditions  below,  although  other factors  could  be  considered.    If  granted,  approval  will  be  without  prejudice  if requested prior to notification of assignment request for opt-in, unless it occurred during  the  time  of  notification.    Humanitarian  requests  generally  include circumstances or events beyond the employee’s control that were not known prior to application. 2.10.4.8.1.2.1.  The recent death of a spouse or child or children. 2.10.4.8.1.2.2.  The  terminal  illness  of  a  family  member  when  death  is imminent.  A supporting note from the attending physician is required. 2.10.4.8.1.2.3.  A  serious  financial  problem  that  is  beyond  the  control  of  the employee (e.g., the loss of a home or possessions through fire, theft or natural disaster). 2.10.4.8.1.3.  Withdrawal from program. An employee seeking to withdraw from the program after official notification of selection must provide justification to the CSLP  office.    Requests  will  be  routed  through  the  CSLP  office  for  approval  by the  Deputy  AF/A1.    Requests  will  also  be  routed  and  coordinated  with  the applicable  CFM.  The  Deputy  AF/A1  will  approve  withdrawal  and  will  also determine if a five-year penalty is warranted. 2.10.4.8.1.4.  Removal  for  cause.    When  a  request  from  the  Senior  Rater, management,  DT  or  organization  is  made  to  remove  a  civilian  from  the  CSLP position for cause, that request must be approved by the Deputy AF/A1.  A letter will  be  permanently  filed  in  the  individual’s  official  personnel  file  and  the employee will be permanently ineligible for any future CSLP opportunity. 2.10.4.8.1.5.  Extension  request.    The  minimum  assignment  is  expected  to  be  36 months.    Requests  for  an  extension  beyond  36  months  will  be  initiated  by  the employee  and  the  current  leadership  providing  the  justification,  with  the concurrence  of  the  employee’s  functional  CFM.  The  request  will  be  processed through  the  CSLP  office.    The  CSLP  office  is  the  approval  authority  for  all AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   27  extensions up to three months beyond the end-of-tour date.  The Deputy AF/A1 is the  approval  authority  for  extensions  greater  than  three  months  beyond  the  end-of-tour date. 2.10.4.9.  Individual  Development  Plan  (IDP).    The  employee  and  supervisor  are responsible for creating and insuring completion of an IDP. 2.10.4.10.  CSLP Training Opportunities.  While on a CSLP assignment, employees may be offered the opportunity to attend additional training utilizing central training funds. 2.10.4.11.  Outplacement - completion of CSLP assignment.  The CSLP office facilitates the employee’s outplacement with the servicing functional CFT with consideration of the enterprise goals, needs and mission requirements in conjunction with the development of the individual. 2.10.4.11.1.  Nine months prior to the assignment completion date, the functional community is notified of the need to outplace the employee. 2.10.4.11.2.  Six months from the assignment completion date, if no outplacement has been identified, the CFDP reviews to identify outplacement opportunities. 2.10.4.11.3.  The  CFT  will  continually  monitor  existing/incoming  career  field  fill requests for which the CSLP participant is  qualified.  After identifying a match, the CFT  will  request  an  updated  resume  and  provide  the  documents  to  the  selecting official  for  consideration.    This  referral  must  be  accompanied  by  an  endorsement from the DT Chair/Co-Chair. 2.10.4.11.4.  The CFTs will coordinate and manage all necessary arrangements such as  PCS  orders,  release  date,  new  reporting  date,  etc.  in  agreement  with  all  involved parties. 2.10.5.  Key  Career  Positions  (KCPs).  The  civilian  workforce  is  comprised  of  centrally managed and non-centrally managed positions. Centrally managed positions consist of career positions  and  KCPs.  Career  positions  are  transitional  for  individuals  with  technical competency  and  management  skills  to  move  from  functional  expertise  to  functional leadership.  KCPs  target  competencies  required  at  the  strategic  leadership  level  and  are vectored through DTs as part of the corporate process.  KCPs are an integral part of the AF’s Civilian  Position  Management  Framework  depicted  in  the  AF  Civilian  Leadership Development Continuum included in Attachment 2. 2.10.5.1.  The  KCPs  provide  the  stepping  stones  for  individuals  to  gain  experience  that may  qualify  them  to  move  from  functional  experts  to  functional  leaders.    They  are frequently filled with high potential career-developed candidates who have demonstrated a  sustained  commitment  to  personal  development  and  adaptability  to  change.    KCP candidates have access to centrally-funded development opportunities to include training and TA. 2.10.5.2.  Key Requirements. 2.10.5.2.1.  Centrally managed by CFs and in a major occupational series. 2.10.5.2.2.  Signed MOA with AF-wide mobility agreement. See figure 2.2.   28  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 2.10.5.2.3.  Assignment  length  is  36-48  months.  An  extension,  up  to  12  months, requires CFM or designee approval. Total assignment cannot exceed 60 months. 2.10.5.2.4.  Provide critical experience in developing CF leadership. 2.10.5.2.5.  KCPs must be vectored by the CF DT process unless a position becomes vacant and there are no DT-vetted candidates.  The position may then be filled with a non-vectored applicant, e.g., through an announcement in USAJOBS. 2.10.5.2.5.1.  At the direction of the DT, a CFT may require candidates to submit a development plan and/or résumé as part of the selection process. 2.10.5.2.5.2.  The  CFT  must  publicize  if  opportunities  are  limited  to  those  who submit a development plan and/or résumé. At a minimum, CFTs must accomplish notification  using  multiple  communication  methods  such  as:  AMS  Robot messages,  list  servers,  newsletters,  bulletin  boards,  websites  and  other  available means. (T-3). 2.10.5.2.5.3.  The  CFTs  will  further  define  criteria  for  their  KCPs  in  their designated chapters in this AFMAN. 2.10.5.2.5.4.  The preferred way to fill KCPs is through the DT slating process. If no  candidates  are  identified  by  the  DT,  an  internal  AF  competitive  certificate should  be  used.  A  CF  DT,  or  its  designated  selecting  authority,  may  make selection  from  a  competitive  certificate.  Staffing  teams  will  announce  the  KCP vacancy and establish a 90-day  register from which to refer qualified candidates to  the  CF  team  (CFT)  or  designee  for  coordination.  The  CFT  will  present  the referral  certificate  to  the  DT  or  designated  selecting  official.  (T-3).  A  PPP exemption does not apply to KCPs, as they are permanent in nature and subject to continuing  mission  requirements.  Commanders/Civilian  Equivalents  will  ensure PPP  is  cleared  via  ASARS  IAW  the  PPP  handbook,  Chapter  4,  Matching  and Filling Positions. (T-3). 2.10.5.3.  Assignments. KCPs are used to facilitate employees’ gaining experience at the operational  and  strategic  levels. Within  the  operational  arena,  assignments  should focus on development within a functional community to gain breadth of experience. This could also be accomplished across occupational lines within a single CF. At the strategic level, assignments should focus on gaining HQ staff, MAJCOM staff, Field Operating Agency (FOA)  or  Joint  experience.  Unlike  CB  positions,  KCPs  are  a  permanent  part  of  an organization‘s infrastructure but are centrally managed by the specific CF. Each CF DT, along with the MAJCOM/FOA/unit, will identify position location and work assignments to  be  accomplished  and  are  subject  to  change  based  on  AF  and  CF  needs.  Employees accepting  KCP  assignments  at  overseas  locations  must  also  sign  Overseas  Return Agreements IAW AFMAN 36-204. 2.10.5.4.  Outplacement from KCPs. 2.10.5.4.1.  Officials  in  all  CFs  who  are  responsible  for  filling  vacant  positions  will give the highest priority (after compliance with any mandated DoD-wide priorities or local  pre-Reduction  In  Force  (RIF)  actions)  to  using  a  management  directed reassignment process to outplace employees graduating from KCPs and the following AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   29  functional  development  programs.  (T-3).  In  the  absence  of  an  agreement  by  the official responsible for filling a vacant position with the proposed outplacement plan, the CF DT Chair(s) responsible for the vacant position has final authority to initiate action  and  fill  the  vacant  position  with  the  corporate  development  program outplacements described below: 2.10.5.4.1.1.  In-residence  Civilian  Developmental  Education  (CDE)  defined  as Intermediate  Developmental  Education  (IDE)  and  Senior  Developmental Education  (SDE),  including  Professional  Military  Education  (PME),  Legislative, RAND, AF National Laboratories Technical fellowships and Academic programs. 2.10.5.4.1.2.  Boarded  CSLP  participants,  Deputy  Director  Installation  Support (DDIS)  and  enterprise  CB  in  Joint  and  HAF.  This  does  not  include  employees who occupy a CSLP position but were not placed through a Boarded process nor CBs managed by the functional authorities. 2.10.5.4.2.  The  management  directed  reassignment  process  may  be  used  to  place program  graduates  into  vacant  positions  and  may  not  be  used  to  displace  any employee from their current position. 2.10.5.4.3.  Commanders/Civilian Equivalents will ensure outplacement efforts begin one year prior to completion of the KCP assignment and involve one or more of the activities listed below. (T-3). 2.10.5.4.3.1.  Inform CF DT members about incumbents vacating a KCP. 2.10.5.4.3.2.  May  send  emails  to  functional  leadership  and  actively  market  the types of series, grade/pay band levels and skills of the incumbents. 2.10.5.4.3.3.  May  send  bulletins  about  program  objectives  and  availability  of individuals outplacing from KCPs to fill projected and unanticipated vacancies. 2.10.5.4.3.4.  Involve  mentors  in  the  outplacement  process,  if  a  mentor  has  been identified. 2.10.5.4.3.5.  Outplace based on DT vectoring. 2.10.5.4.4.  CFTs will consider employee preferences and the occupational series and grade/bands identified in the MOA and will monitor recruit/fill requests for possible matches.  Once  a  match  is  identified,  the  CFT  will  provide  a  career  brief,  résumé, endorsement from the DT Chair/Co-Chair or designee and other pertinent information to the selecting official. (T-3). Personal career goals and geographic and assignment preference should be considered but are not guaranteed. If reassignment/outplacement is  not  accepted,  adverse  action,  such  as  change  to  lower  grader  or  removal  from employment may be enforced per the MOA. 2.10.5.5.  Finalizing  the  Outplacement.    An  outplacement  should  be  finalized  and  all necessary arrangements such as Permanent Change of Station (PCS) orders, release date, new  reporting  date,  etc.,  should  be  settled  within  six  months  but  no  later  than  60  days from the end of the KCP assignment. 2.10.5.6.  Payment of KCP Incumbents. 2.10.5.6.1.  Salaries and overtime pay are locally funded and not centrally funded.   30  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 2.10.5.6.2.  Incentive  and  annual  performance  awards  are  locally  funded  and  not centrally funded. 2.10.5.6.3.  The  central  PCS  account  funds  the  PCS  for  employees  moving  into  and out of KCPs (at the GS-13/14/15 or equivalent level). KCPs are authorized use of the Defense  National  Relocation  Program  (DNRP)  when  moving  to  a  CONUS  or  non-foreign OCONUS location IAW the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR). This instruction has been reviewed by the Per Diem, Travel and Transportation Allowance Committee staff  in  accordance  with  DoDI  5154.31,  Commercial  Travel  Management:  The  Per Diem,  Travel  and  Transportation  Allowance  Committee  (PDTATAC),  Volume  5, dated 8 October 2015, as PDTATAC Case RR16001. Section C - Participation 2.11.  Career  Mobility.  Effective  force  development  depends  upon  filling  high-level  positions with highly qualified employees who have a variety of work experiences.  This experience may be  acquired  at  various  geographic  locations  throughout  the  AF  or  at  organizations  or organizational levels in the same geographic area.  These varied experiences provide employees a range of challenges and demands that may not be experienced in a single type of position or at only  one  installation  or  organizational  level.    The  career-minded  employee  should  seek  such work experiences in more than one organization or location in a lifetime career.  This depth and breadth of experience may be the factor that makes an employee the best qualified for referral.  To  attain  appropriate  depth  and  breadth  of  experience  in  preparation  for  the  next  level  of challenges,  employees  should  remain  assigned  no  less  than  four  years  in  CONUS  centrally managed positions and no less than the prescribed overseas tour in OCONUS centrally managed positions.    See  figure  2.1.  for  a  sample  CONUS  Employment  Agreement.    AFMAN  36-204 provides  samples  of  OCONUS  Employment  Agreements.    Employees  seeking  positions  with increased  responsibilities  are  encouraged  to  apply  for  promotion(s)  and/or  make  themselves available for reassignment to fulfill AF mission needs. 2.11.1.  De-emphasis on Geographic Mobility.  Breadth and depth of experience are among the most relevant criteria for selections in civilian hiring and promotions.  Therefore, instead of  hiring  based  on  the  employee’s  record  of  geographic  mobility,  selecting  officials  will evaluate  employee  history  based  on  the  positions  held  and  expertise  developed  in  each position, regardless of the position’s geographic location.  Prior geographic mobility will not be  a  selection  factor  for  hiring  and  promotions.    AFI  36-202,  Civilian  Mobility,  provides additional guidance on mobility. 2.11.2.  Types of mobility include: 2.11.2.1.  Organizational  Mobility.  Organizational  mobility  is  movement  between organizational  levels  (e.g.,  base  to  MAJCOM);  between  major  subdivisions  within  an organizational  level;  between  MAJCOMs  and  comparable  organizations  or  other  major subdivisions  within  the  AF;  and  between  the  AF  and  other  Components/Agencies  with the DoD, other federal agencies, or private organizations. 2.11.2.2.  Functional  Mobility.  Functional  mobility  is  movement  between  specialties  or disciplines within a CF or movement across CFs. 2.11.2.3.  Geographic Mobility. Each of the above types of developmental mobility may or  may  not  involve  geographic  mobility,  since  a  variety  of  assignments  are  possible AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   31  within  the  same  geographic  area  without  changing  a  place  of  residence.  Geographic mobility  is  a  change  in  permanent  duty  assignment  from  one  location  to  another  that requires the employee to undergo a PCS. 2.11.3.  Mobility  Requirements.  When  a  mobility  agreement  is  necessary,  the  employee, AFPC  and/or  the  servicing  CPS  representative  sign  a  written  statement  of  conditions  (see sample  mobility  agreement  at  figure  2.2.)  The  mobility  agreement  is  a  condition  of employment  and  should  be  signed  by  the  employee  prior  to  the  assignment  or  prior  to making a final commitment. 2.11.3.1.  The following AF positions require mobility as a condition of employment  or assignment: 2.11.3.1.1.  Interns.  Reference  AFI  36-602  for  detail  on  Pathways  Recent  Graduates and PAQ/COP Intern mobility. 2.11.3.1.2.  CB and Career Enhancing. These positions require a mobility agreement as  a  condition  of  assignment  to  ensure  the  positions  are  vacated  after  a  specified period and to ensure continuous development of employees. 2.11.3.1.3.  Long-Term  Training  (LTT).  As  part  of  the  application  package  for  an LTT  developmental  opportunity,  an  employee  will  be  required  to  sign  an  AF-wide mobility  agreement,  with  the  exception  of  attendance  at  in-residence  Air  Command and  Staff  College,  which  does  not  require  a  mobility  agreement  unless  there  is  no position in the local area for the employee to fill upon return following graduation. 2.11.3.1.4.  CSLP.  As  a  key  leadership  development  experiential  program,  CSLP positions are few in number and require movement of the employee upon completion of their tenure in the position to ensure continued flow of employees. 2.11.3.1.5.  KCPs.  KCPs  are  specific,  CF-identified  GS-13  to  GS-15  (or  equivalent) positions  which  are  a  subset  of  CF  centrally-managed  positions  that  are  used  to develop  critical  AF  leadership  competencies.  Grade  exceptions  have  been  made  in some CFs. 2.11.3.1.6.  Specific  CF  Positions.  Contact  the  specific  CFT  for  further  details  on centrally managed positions’ mobility requirements. 2.12.  Individual  Development  Plan  (IDP).  Completion  of  an  IDP  is  essential  for  career minded employees who aspire to  higher-level responsibilities. CFs  may use  development plans for training nominations selections  and  management/leadership development opportunities, i.e., CB,  CDE,  assessments,  interviews,  career  counseling,  and  workforce  analysis.  Employees complete development plans through online tools. 2.12.1.  Applicability. 2.12.1.1.  Training  and  Development.  CFTs,  employees  and/or  supervisors  may  identify training  and  development  opportunities,  such  as  TA,  management  development  courses and assignments, for employees. 2.12.1.2.  Management  and  Leadership  Development.  Management  and  leadership development  of  the  civilian  workforce  is  an  essential  component  of  long-term  mission readiness.  The  AF  Civilian  Development  Continuum  (Attachment  2)  is  the  corporate   32  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 prototype  to  sustain  senior-level  civilian  development  and  prepare  high-potential employees for leadership opportunities. These programs prepare the civilian workforce to compete  for  shared  leadership  positions  and  provide  executive  credentialing  for  high-potential  managers.  AF-wide  nomination  and  selection  criteria  are  used  for  AF-wide competitive development programs (CSLP, KCP and CB positions), as well as CDE. 2.12.1.3.  Workforce  Analysis  and  Management  Advisory  Service.  CFs  utilize development  plan  data  for  a  variety  of  workforce  analysis  and  reports  to  senior leadership. 2.12.2.  Eligible Categories. The following categories of employees are eligible to complete a development plan: 2.12.2.1.  Permanent  AF  full-time,  part-time  and  intermittent  employees  serving  on  a competitive appointment. 2.12.2.2.  Permanent  AF  full-time,  part-time  and  intermittent  employees  in  the  excepted service provided they are eligible for non-competitive conversion to a competitive service appointment. 2.12.2.3.  Permanent  AF  full-time,  part-time  and  intermittent  employees  in  the  excepted service who have not held a competitive appointment are eligible for CF excepted service positions only. 2.13.  Currency  and  Accuracy  of  Employee  Data.  Employees  are  ultimately  responsible  for ensuring  the  accuracy  of  their  data  in  DCPDS,  and  are  required  to  review  their  records periodically to make certain their education, awards, etc. are properly documented and they have an accurate and updated résumé. Employees are able to use the MyBiz+ Self Service module to update  certain  information  in  their  personnel  record  to  include:  licenses,  occupational certifications,  education,  training,  work  information  (phone  number,  email  address,  physical work  address),  home  phone  number,  handicap  code,  ethnicity  and  race  category,  language  and emergency contact information. 2.13.1.  Acquisition  Professional  Development  Program  (APDP).  APDP  certifications entered  in  MyBiz+  by  employees  are  not  automatically  updated  in  the  DCPDS  acquisition certification  data  fields.  Employees  are  encouraged  to  use  the  ACQNow  website  to  review current  APDP  certifications,  records  and  requirements.  The  ACQNow  site  is  automatically updated as requirements are completed. 2.13.2.  Education  Changes.  Updates/changes  to  an  employee’s  education  by  the  employee are  listed  as  “Self  Certified.”  For  positions  which  require  positive  education  (a  specific degree  or  24  hours  of  related  course  work),  employees  are  responsible  for  ensuring  their transcripts  are  on  file  for  review  to  prove  qualifications  are  met.  Employees  can  submit education, license, language and occupational certifications and get additional information on Self Service by going to the myPers website and searching for “Self Service.” 2.13.3.  Employee Résumé. Employees may be asked to submit résumés in support of CF and force  development  processes,  such  as  nominations  for training  and  development, selection/assessment boards, competency assessments, or upon request by selecting officials for competitive referrals. Additionally, employees may submit a comprehensive résumé, via myPers, that is profiled in their electronic Official Personnel File (eOPF) and can be used for AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   33  Human  Resources  purposes  (i.e.,  to  verify  qualifications  for  a  management  initiated reassignment; Reduction-in-Force (RIF), etc.). 2.14.  Affirmative  Employment  Program  (AEP)  Planning.  Guidance and responsibilities for the Affirmative Employment Program Plan (AEPP) reside under the auspices of AF/A1Q. Section D - Filling Positions 2.15.  Filling Centrally Managed Positions.  The AFPC servicing staffing team must follow the CF  approved  procedure  when  filling  centrally  managed  positions.  (T-3).  Centrally  managed positions are filled using the guidance in AFMAN 36-203. 2.15.1.  Promotion  Panel  Responsibilities.  Functional  promotion  panels  or  workgroups  are responsible  for  developing  AF-wide  merit  promotion  criteria  and  assessments  for  centrally managed  positions  in  their  CF.  CFTs  annually  review  the  results  of  the  application  of  the assessments and make adjustments to them to ensure their currency. Over time, they ensure that assessments reinforce the technical, business and leadership competencies outlined in the CF’s  developmental  career  paths.  They  also  assure  that,  taken  as  a  whole,  assessments  are logical,  consistent,  fair,  represent  the  expectations  of  the  CF  and  support  corporate  FD objectives.  The  CFTs  maintain  responsibility  for  identifying,  approving  and  validating promotion  criteria  and  assessments  for  non-centrally  managed  positions  in  their  individual CFs. 2.15.2.  Defense  Civilian  Intelligence  Personnel  Management  System  (DCIPS).  DCIPS  has special  authorities  for  compensation  and  filling positions,  details  and  promotions;  however, standard  CF  promotion  plans  and  assessments  are  used.  Refer  to  AFI  36-1101,  Civilian Intelligence Personnel Management System, for guidance. 2.15.3.  AF Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI).  AFOSI has special authorizations for filling positions, details and promotions.  Refer to  AFOSII 36-201, Civilian Personnel, and Chapter 17 of this manual for guidance. 2.15.4.  Air Reserve Technician (ART). HQ AFRC/A1C has authority and responsibility for filling positions, details, reassignments and promotions for ART officer positions. 2.16.  Methods of Filling Positions. 2.16.1.  CFT  Actions.  Centrally  managed  positions  are  filled  through  both  competitive  and non-competitive  methods.    In  most  instances,  the  movement  of  a  person  into  a  centrally managed  position  is  in  the  best  interest  of  the  AF.  There  may  be  some  cases  where  a  paid PCS would not be necessary to fill a centrally managed CFT position. 2.16.1.1.  The CPS can help identify which positions may be filled with local candidates based  on  local  market  conditions  (i.e.,  existing  pool  of  local  employees,  prevalence  of retired  military,  unemployment  in  the  area,  etc.).    If  local  market  conditions  provide  a sufficient pool of candidates, the gaining organization must clearly identify on the request for  personnel  action  (RPA)  that  a  paid  PCS  is  not  in  the  interest  of  the  government.  Examples include, but are not limited to: 2.16.1.1.1.  A civilian personnel office in the San Antonio area is filling a GS-0201-12,  Human  Resource  Specialist  (Civilian  Personnel  Section  Chief)  position.    A government-funded  PCS  may  not  be  in  the  best  interest  of  the  AF  due  to  the overwhelming GS-0201-11/12 population in the local commuting area.   34  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 2.16.1.1.2.  A  GS-2010-12  Logistician  position  at  Hill  AFB  needs  to  be  filled.    A government-funded  PCS  may  not  be  in  the  best  interest  of  the  AF  due  to  the overwhelming GS-2010-11/12 population in the commuting area. 2.16.1.2.  There could be other compelling reasons that a PCS move is not in the interest of the government, but rather in the interest of the employee.  In such cases, the AF must not  fund  the  PCS.    Examples  of  PCS  moves  not  in  the  interest  of  the  government  may include, but are not limited to: 2.16.1.2.1.  Employee  completes  OCONUS  service  agreement,  but  for  personal reasons  remains  at  OCONUS than  six  months  without requesting/obtaining  the  Commander/Civilian  Equivalent  approval  to  extend  time limit for beginning return PCS travel. location  for  more 2.16.1.2.2.  Employee  has  not  completed  all  48  months  of  AF  CONUS  Service Agreement  (see  figure  2.1.)  and  does  not  meet  eligible  waiver  requirements  for  a second AF-funded move. 2.16.2.  Officials  in  all  CFs  who  are  responsible  for  filling  vacant  positions  will  give  the highest  priority  (after  compliance  with  any  mandated  DOD-wide  priorities  or  local  pre-Reduction-In-Force  (RIF)  actions)  to  using  a  management  directed  reassignment  process to outplace employees graduating from the following corporate development programs: (T-3). 2.16.2.1.  In-residence Civilian Developmental Education (CDE) defined as Intermediate Developmental  Education  (IDE)  and  Senior  Developmental  Education  (SDE)  including Professional  Military  Education  (PME),  Legislative,  RAND,  AF  National  Laboratories Technical fellowships and Academic programs. 2.16.2.2.  Boarded  CSLP  participants.    This  does  not  include  employees  who  occupy  a CSLP position but were not placed through a boarded process. 2.16.3.  Area of Consideration (Competitive). The normal area of consideration for all locally and  centrally  managed  permanent  non-bargaining  unit  positions  is  DoD-wide,  Transfer, Reinstatement,  ICTAP,  VEOA, Military Spouse and Schedule A eligibles.  Additionally,  no prior  approval  for  this  expanded  AOC  will  be  required  from  the  Career  Field  Management Teams (CFMTs) for centrally managed positions. Check with local Civilian Personnel offices for  status  of  bargaining  unit  positions.    Exceptions  to  the  standard  AOC  will  be  limited  to positions subject to the Developmental Team process, career broadener/intern outplacements and  placements  to  minimize  adverse  action  (displaced  employees).  Expanding  the  AOC  to include  DoD,  transfer  eligibles  and  applicants  with  prior  competitive  status  will  provide optimum  flexibility  for  management  and  allow  the  flow  of  high  quality  candidates  across component  lines,  to  include  the  COCOMs,  with  regards  to  diversity  of  background, experiences,  demographics  and  perspective.  There  may  be  instances,  however,  in  which  an expanded AOC is warranted.  If the CFT determines qualified AOC candidates are available, Commanders/Civilian Equivalents will ensure that an external recruit fill personnel action is not  approved.  (T-3).  The  servicing  staffing  team  conducts  the  fill  actions  in  support  of temporary  appointments,  term  appointments,  and  details.  They  may  also  fill  encumbered positions upgraded by classification, as defined in AFMAN 36-203. 2.16.4.  Exempting  Positions  from  the  CF  Referral  Process.  When  a  special  one-time exemption from filling a position through normal CF processes is necessary, the organization AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   35  will  submit  an  e-mail  request  through  their  CPS  and  MAJCOM,  to  the  CFT,  along  with justification,  to  exempt  the  position  from  the  CF’s  central  referral  process.  The  CFT  will route the request to the CF FM, or designee, for approval. (T-3). 2.17.  Requesting Fill Action. 2.17.1.  Servicing  Staffing  Team.  Once  CF  and  DT  vector  priorities  are  cleared,  the  AFPC servicing staffing team will begin the fill process. 2.17.2.  Clearing the DoD PPP. When filling centrally managed positions, it is necessary to comply with DoDI 1400.20, DoD Program for Stability of Civilian Employment. In the event of a PPP “match” AFMAN 36-203 outlines the specific procedures to be followed. 2.17.3.  Considering  Spouse  Preference  Eligibles.  Similarly,  Commanders/Civilian Equivalents will ensure that the consideration of candidates entitled to “Spouse Preference” is  IAW  merit  promotion  procedures  and  guidance  governing  Military  Spouse  Preference  , including  DoDI  1404.2,  Employment  of  Spouse  of  Active  Duty  Military  Members  Stationed Worldwide;  AFI  34-310,  Nonappropriated  Fund  Personnel  Program  Management  and Administration Procedures; and AFMAN 36-203. (T-3). 2.17.4.  Clearing  CF  Priorities.  In  addition  to  observing  all  statutory  and  regulatory placement priorities, individual CFs may also establish procedures for the consideration and placement  of  certain  types  of  employees  in  advance  of  normal  methods  of  filling  centrally managed  positions.  Examples  of  such  CF  priorities  include:  outplacement  of  employees completing  a  career  broadening  assignment;  employees  completing  long-term  training  and other formal training/development programs such as CSLP; or KCP assignment. If the CFT determines  a  vectored  outplacement  candidate  from  a  training/development  program  is available  and  qualified,  Commanders/Civilian  Equivalents  will  ensure  that  a  recruit  fill personnel action is not approved without CFT approval. (T-3). 2.18.  Methods for Filling Unique Positions.  See area of consideration, para. 2.16.3. 2.18.1.  Joint or Unified Command Positions. AF CFTs centrally manage positions in Joint or Unified Commands for which the AF is the executive agent. The FM or designee may grant exceptions  to  this  guidance.  Referral  by  the  servicing  staffing  team  is  the  sole  source  of internal and external candidates for permanent fill actions of centrally managed positions. If a staffing need is identified to utilize an OPM or DEU/DEO certificate and the CF approves, the  AFPC  servicing  staffing  team  utilizes  the  assessment  approved  by  the  CFT. Commanders/Civilian  Equivalents  will  ensure  that  the  processes  outlined  in  para.  2.17.  are followed. (T-3). 2.19.  Missed  Consideration  from  a  Referral  Certificate.  Commanders/Civilian  Equivalents will ensure that individuals receive priority referral if consideration was denied due to errors in the DCPDS database or other administrative errors beyond the candidate’s control.  See AFMAN 36-203, Table 2.3., for additional information. If the administrative error is discovered prior to a selection  from  a  referral  certificate,  candidates  who  missed  consideration  are  referred  on  a supplemental  certificate.  If  a  selection  has  been  made,  and  a  job  offer  extended  and  accepted, Commanders/Civilian  equivalents  will  ensure  that  priority  consideration  is  granted.  (T-3). Priority consideration terminates when priority referral is made or 12 months from the date the HR Specialist notifies the employee of priority referral, whichever is earlier.   36  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 2.20.  Overseas  Employment.  See  AFMAN  36-204  for  information  on  overseas  employment and return placement programs as they relate to employees in centrally managed positions. 2.21.  PCS  and  Waivers  to  Service/Employment  Agreement.  An  employee  in  a  centrally managed  position  is  assigned  to  a  specific  activity,  i.e.,  permanent  duty  station  (PDS). AFPC/DP3D  is  the  final  approval  authority  for  all  service  agreement/employment  agreement waivers  as  well  as  PCS  orders  issuance  approval.  Locally  funded  moves  are  not  covered  in AFMAN 36-606. 2.21.1.  CONUS Assignments. Employees are required under a service agreement (DD Form 1618) to complete a minimum of 12 months. (JTR, par. 5840-B). The basis of the restriction is  the  prudence  and  cost  associated  with  moving  an  employee  twice  within  a  12-month period.  (JTR,  par.  5502-C).  The  Air  Force  requires  a  minimum  48-month  tour  length  for employees  in  CONUS  CFT  centrally  managed  positions.  The  48-month  Employee Agreement (see figure 2.1) incorporates the minimum JTR 12-month requirement. 2.21.1.1.  Employee  in  Months  1-12  -  Basis  for  Waivers/Release  for  CONUS  Tour (Service) Agreement/AF Employment Agreement (JTR, par. 5844). 2.21.1.1.1.  Reasons  Beyond Employee  Control-Acceptable to Air  Force for Release from Service Agreement/Air Force Employment Agreement (JTR, par. 5844).  Note: JTR,  par.  5844A  references  commanding  officer/designee  of  assigned  activity  as making  determination  of  acceptable  reason  for  release;  however,  since  the  affected employees  are  all  centrally  managed,  the  commanding  officer/designee  makes  a recommendation  to  AFPC/DP3D  who  makes  the  final  approval.    The  reasons  listed below for release do not infer second paid move is in the interest of the AF. 2.21.1.1.1.1.  Illness not induced by misconduct. 2.21.1.1.1.2.  Enlistment/call to active duty in the Armed Forces. 2.21.1.1.1.3.  Exercise of statutory re-employment rights within a time limitation that precludes completion of a tour of duty. 2.21.1.1.1.4.  Release  for  the  convenience  of  the  Government,  e.g.,  separation because  of  physical/mental  disqualification,  lack  of  skill  to  perform  duties  for which recruited or any other duties to which the employee could be assigned. An employee  separated  because  of  illness  induced  by  misconduct  or  because  of misconduct is not separated for the Government's convenience. 2.21.1.1.1.5.  Separation as a result of RIF. 2.21.1.1.1.6.  When  Air  Force  does  not  require  employee's  services  for  entire tour/service/employment agreement period. 2.21.1.1.2.  Release  due  to  Transfer  to  Other  Departments/Agencies.  Except  as indicated  in  JTR,  par.  5502-C,  an  employee  who  transfers  to  another  DoD component/Government  agency  must  be  released  from  the  tour  of  duty  requirement specific  in  the  employee's  current  service/AF  employment  agreement  (JTR,  para. 5844-C).  Note:    If  the  transfer  involves  PCS  allowances  to  a  new  PDS,  the  gaining activity is responsible for all PCS costs. The employee must continue in Government service  for  at  least  12  months  after  the  employee  reported  at  the  PDS  from  which AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   37  departing to satisfy the obligation for costs incurred by the losing activity in moving the employee to that PCS. 2.21.1.1.3.

Employee  in  Months  1-12  -  Waiver  and  PCS  Processing  Steps.  This process  involves  an  employee  with  a  basis  for  release  from  an  existing  service agreement/AF employment agreement IAW para. 2.21.1.1.1., and whose move is one of  the  exceptions  listed  in  para.  2.21.1.1.3.  The  selecting  official  for  a  centrally managed position at the new duty station is to follow these steps: 2.21.1.1.4.1.  Provide  an  explanation  as  to  why  the  proposed  transfer  is  in  the interest of the government. 2.21.1.1.4.2.  Provide a signed statement that an equally qualified employee is not available within the commuting area of the activity concerned and that the losing activity agrees to the transfer. Describe efforts that were made to find a candidate who would not require a waiver. 2.21.1.1.4.3.  Submit  the  package  to  the  Servicing  CPS  at  the  new  location  who will  provide  the  waiver  recommendation  to  the  commander/designee  at  the assigned duty location for coordination. 2.21.1.1.4.4.  Waiver  request  package  is  forwarded  to  the  applicable  CFT  Chief for  review  to  ensure  the  supporting  documentation  supports  the  waiver  request. CFT  Chief  forwards  the  request  package  to  the  Functional  Manager  (FM)/DT Chair  or  designee  for  concurrence/non-concurrence  and  coordination.  A concurrence must articulate that: 1) the waiver is in the best interests of the CF; 2) the  need  to  select  the  employee  outweighs  the  additional  cost  of  a  second  PCS; and  3)  supporting  documents  show  sufficient  efforts  were  made  to  locate  a candidate most qualified for the position who would not require a waiver. 2.21.1.1.4.5.  If  the  FM/DT  Chair  concurs,  the  CFT  Chief  submits  the  waiver package  to  AFPC/DP3DW  for  review.  AFPC/DP3DW  reviews  package  for compliance and recommends approval/disapproval to AFPC/DP3D who makes a final decision. 2.21.1.1.4.6.  If  the  FM/DT  Chair  or  designee  does  not  concur,  the  package  will be returned to the selecting official with notice of the decision.   38  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 2.21.1.3.  Employee  in  Months  1-12  -  Financial  Effect  of  Waiver.  An  approved  waiver releases the employee from all financial liabilities associated with failure to complete the service  agreement  (DD  Form  1618)/Air  Force  Employment  Agreement.    If  a  waiver  is not approved and the employee fails to complete the terms of the service agreement (DD Form  1618),  the  employee  is  in  violation  of  the  agreement.  (JTR,  para.  5846).  The employee  must  reimburse  the  Government  the  costs  paid  for  relocation  expenses  based on  that  service  agreement  and  is  not  eligible  for  subsequent  travel  and  transportation allowances. A service agreement violation includes failure to: 2.21.1.3.1.  Meet/comply  with  the  conditions  specified  in  an  agreement  for  reasons unacceptable to the Air Force. 2.21.1.3.2.  Report for duty. 2.21.1.3.3.  Return  to  the  country/geographic  locality  in  which  the  home  of  record (actual residence) is located in connection with a renewal agreement. 2.21.1.4.  Employee with Service Agreement Waiver Request - No PCS in Months 1-12. Employee should submit the request through the supervisor and servicing CPS who will obtain  the  local  Commander/designee's  recommendation,  based  on  para.  2.21.1.1.1.  or 2.21.1.1.2., and forward to AFPC/DP3D for final approval. 2.21.1.5.  Employee  in  Months  13-48  -  Waivers/Release  -  AF  Employment  Agreement-AF-Funded PCS. 2.21.1.5.1.  Basis for waiver and PCS funding. AF does  not  require a formal waiver approval  process  when  the  basis  for  the  release  is  one  of  the  below-listed  reasons. Any  other  basis  needs  to  be  reviewed  by  the  CPS  and  coordinated  as  outlined  in 2.21.1.1.4. 2.21.1.5.1.1.  Employee is separated as a result of RIF. 2.21.1.5.1.2.  Employee is called to active duty or enlistment in the Armed Forces. 2.21.1.5.1.3.  Employee  is  selected  for  promotion  within  13-48  months  of  last PCS. 2.21.1.5.1.4.  OCONUS returnees with tour length that was less than 48 months. 2.21.1.5.1.5.

Release for the Government's convenience (e.g., separation because of  physical/mental  disqualification,  lack  of  skill  to  perform  duties  for  which recruited  or  any  other  duties  to  which  the  employee  could  be  assigned).  An employee  separated  because  of  illness  induced  by  misconduct  or  because  of misconduct is not separated for the Government's convenience. 2.21.1.5.1.7.  Employees  who  signed  a two-year  CONUS  Transportation agreement  in  FY13  are  exempt  from  the  48-month  time  on  station  requirement; they  must  comply  with  the  two-year  agreement  signed  in  FY13.  However,  an employee with PCS orders showing an Entrance on Duty (EOD) date on or after 1 Mar 2014 must sign a new Air Force CONUS Employment Agreement to comply with the 48-month requirement. AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   39  2.21.1.5.2.  Employee in Months 13-48 - Waiver-PCS Processing Steps. If waiver of the  AF  employment  agreement  is  based  on  reasons  not  listed  in  sub  paras.  of 2.21.1.5.1,  the  selecting  official  follows  the  steps  outlined  in  para.  2.21.1.1.4  for approval/disapproval by AFPC/DP3D. 2.21.1.5.3.  Employee  in  Months  13-48  -  Effect  of  disapproved  AF  Employment Agreement waiver/release-AF PCS. If the employee has not completed months 13-48 of  the  AF  Employment  Agreement,  the  employee  does  not  incur  any  financial liability.

OCONUS Assignments. An employee appointed/transferred to an OCONUS position is required to complete a prescribed tour of duty (JTR, Appendix Q, Part 3) at the OCONUS PDS  for  return  travel  and  transportation  allowances.  (JTR,  par.  5820-E).  The  employee executes a service agreement (DD Form 1617 entitled Transportation Agreement) (JTR, par. 5832)  for  the  applicable  situation,  based  on  employee  status  (JTR,  par.  5828)  and  IAW applicable  agreement  in  AFMAN  36-204.  The  employee  obligation  is  a  minimum  of  12 months to avoid financial obligations. To obtain eligibility for return travel and transportation allowances, the member must remain for the prescribed tour, unless there is an AFPC/DP3D approved waiver or release from the service agreement (DD Form 1617). 2.21.2.1.

Reasons  Beyond Employee  Control-Acceptable to Air  Force for Release (JTR, par. 5844-B). In addition to reasons listed at para. 2.21.1.1.1., the following are applicable JTR, par. 5844-B2): 2.21.2.1.1.1.  The  employee’s  immediate  presence  is  required  in  the  geographic locality  in  which  the  actual  residence  is  located  because  of  an  unforeseen emergency. Actual residence is explained in JTR, pars. 5824 and 5826. 2.21.2.1.1.2.  Completion  of  the  agreed  tour/service/employment  agreement would  result  in  extreme  personal  hardship  because  of  circumstances  beyond  the employee’s control, such as conditions seriously affecting the health, welfare and safety  of  the  employee;  serious  illness  or  death  in  the  immediate  family;  or  the imminent  breakup  of  the  family  group.  For  verification  requirements  involving "extreme  personal  hardship"  see  para.  2.21.2.1.1.4.  Falsification  of  facts  ICW employment is not a reason beyond the employee's control. 2.21.2.1.1.3.  There  are  significant  changes  in  the  employee's  employment situation  or  loss  of  economic  benefits  such  as  a  significant  salary  loss  resulting from a downgrading of the grade level the employee accepted upon assignment, or  a  significant  loss  in  OCONUS  quarters  allowance  payments  resulting  from  a downgrade  as  distinguished  from  a  reduction  in  quarters  allowance  payment which may be reduced for other reason.   40  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 2.21.2.1.1.4.  Verification.  The  nature  and  extent  of  the  "unforeseen  emergency" or  "extreme  personal  hardship"  must  be  established  to  the  determining  official's satisfaction. Verification must be received from a reliable and trustworthy source such as private, state or local welfare agencies; an attending physician; or a local cleric. (JTR, par. 5844-D). 2.21.2.1.2.  Release  due  to  Transfer  to  Other  Departments/Agencies.    See  para. 2.21.1.1.2. 2.21.2.2.  OCONUS Employee Performing Prescribed Tour with more than one planned PCS-Waiver  Processing  Steps.  This  process  involves  an  OCONUS  employee  who  has been  selected  for  a  position  that  requires  a  funded  PCS  and/or  return  travel  and transportation  allowances  and  release  from  an  existing  service  agreement/Overseas employment  agreement.  Follow  the  steps  outlined  in  para.2.21.1.1.4.  Refer  to  JTR,  par. 5828 for detail about service agreement. AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   41  Figure 2.1.

PCS Funding and Allowances.  2.22.1.  Each  CF  will  have  a  pre-approved  list  of  designated  positions  which  includes  title, grade  and  series  of  centrally  managed  and  key  career  positions.  The  centrally-funded  PCS Account funds a relocation to fill positions specifically identified by each CF in advance of funds obligation. The Civilian PCS Account centrally funds the following moves and related expenses: 2.22.1.1.  Move of an AF employee selected for a CFT managed position, either from a referral  certificate  or  through  a  management-initiated  assignment,  where  approved  in advance by the FM or designee.   44  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 2.22.1.2.  Move of an individual selected from a certificate for a CFT managed position if the person is a current Federal employee. 2.22.1.3.  First-duty station move for an external reinstatement eligible applicant. 2.22.1.4.  Return PCS when the Civilian PCS Account funded the move of an employee to  an  overseas  location  or  U.S.  territory,  except  where  the  employee  is  selected  for  a position offering reimbursement of authorized PCS expenses. 2.22.1.5.  Return  move  of  an  employee  who  retires  overseas  when  the  Civilian  PCS Account funded the initial overseas move. 2.22.1.6.  Temporary  quarters  subsistence  expense  (TQSE)  and  miscellaneous  expenses of an employee returning from another component in an overseas area or a U.S. territory to a stateside CFT centrally managed position, including those affected by PPP. 2.22.2.  AF  organizations  must  provide  funding  to  cover  all  PCS  costs  that  result  from decisions  to  implement  programmatic  actions  involving  ramp-ups,  stand-up  of  new organizations, reorganizations, realignments and military-to-civilian or contractor-to-civilian conversions requiring a CF PCS action.  Organizations are responsible for programming the cost  and  providing  funding  to  implement  all  policy  and  operational,  training  and  resource requirements  relating  to  their  force  shaping  actions.  This  guidance  applies  to  future programmatic  actions  approved  in  the  Corporate  Structure  without  PCS  costs  factored  into the original decision and to actions self-initiated by the organization or functional leadership that  impact  the  centrally  managed  Civilian  PCS  Account.  Exceptions  require  AF/A1  pre-approval. 2.22.3.  Allowances. 2.22.3.1.  House Hunting Trip (HHT). For eligible employees (JTR, Ch 5, Part B, Section 12), AF authorizes employees and/or their spouse a maximum of five (5) days, including travel days, to search for permanent housing at the gaining PDS. 2.22.3.2.  Temporary  Quarters  Subsistence  Expense  (TQSE).  For  eligible  employees (JTR, Ch 5, Part B, Section 9), AF authorizes TQSE for employees as follows: 2.22.3.2.1.  Within  CONUS  Moves.    Authorized  a  maximum  of  21  days  TQSE- Actual Expense (AE) reimbursement method only. 2.22.3.2.2.  Overseas Returnees (Includes non-foreign overseas returnees). Employees are authorized the option of 30 days TQSE-Lump Sum (LS) or 60 days TQSE (AE) reimbursement methods. The employee may not change the TQSE method after travel begins. (JTR, par. 5774-D5b). the (AE)  beyond 2.22.3.2.3.  Extending  TQSE  (AE)  Past  the  Initial  Period.  The  criteria  for  extending TQSE initial  period  shall  be  uniformly  applied.  The authorizing/order-issuing  official  must  determine  there  are  compelling  reasons  to continue occupying temporary quarters.  Extensions are not automatic and will only be  granted  on  a  case-by-case  basis  and  in  situations  where  there  is  a  demonstrated need for additional time due to circumstances beyond the employee’s control and that are acceptable to the AF. Circumstances that exist at the time of transfer, such as high cost of housing, high interest rates or a poor housing market may not be sufficient to warrant  extending  the  TQSE  (AE)  period.  JTR,  par.  5802-B2  lists  examples  of AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   45  compelling  reasons  or  circumstances  which  might  be  considered  beyond  the employee’s  control,  although  they  are  not  all-inclusive.  AFPC/FMAC  Resources Office:  (AFPCDPIEAResourcesOffice@us.af.mil)  is  the  authorizing/order  issuing official  for  all  CFTs  except  the  AOCMP,  which  is  managed  by  AFRC/A1C.  To clearly  demonstrate  the  need  for  a  TQSE  extension,  the  employee  must  submit  the following information and documentation to the authorizing/order issuing official: 2.22.3.2.3.1.  Date employee reported for duty at the new PDS. 2.22.3.2.3.2.  Date employee began TQSE. 2.22.3.2.3.3.  Date  employee’s  dependents  began  occupying  temporary  quarters and qualifying for TQSE. 2.22.3.2.3.4.  Number of TQSE days initially authorized. 2.22.3.2.3.5.  Number of days taken for HHT, if any. 2.22.3.2.3.6.  Anticipated date permanent quarters will be occupied. 2.22.3.2.3.7.  Number of days’ extension requested. 2.22.3.2.3.8.  Copy  of  contract  to  purchase  or  lease  permanent  quarters  showing closing or occupancy date. 2.22.3.2.3.9.  If  request  is  based  on  delay  in  HHG  delivery,  include  a  statement from  the  Traffic  Management  Office  (TMO)  showing  date  of  HHG  pickup  and anticipated  date  of  delivery/receipt.  If  applicable,  this  should  also  include  a statement explaining the delay in delivering out of temporary storage. 2.22.3.2.3.10.  If request is based on delay in processing mortgage application, a statement  from  the  mortgage  company  showing  date  employee  applied  for  the mortgage, the normal processing time and the reason for the delay. An extension request due to a closing date originally scheduled outside the initial TQSE period is  not  a  valid  request  since  the  employee  had  an  option  to  enter  into  a  contract knowing the initial period of TQSE would expire prior to the final transaction. 2.22.3.2.3.11.  Other  supporting  documentation  as  deemed  appropriate  by  the employee or agency. 2.22.3.3.  Waiver Process for Real Estate Time Extensions beyond the One-Year Period (Two  Year  Maximum).  AF  may  grant  an  extension  if  extenuating  circumstances prevented the sale/purchase transaction to be completed within the one-year time period and the delayed transaction is reasonably related to the PCS. (JTR, par. 5908-C). 2.22.3.3.1.  Employee has a one-year time limit that begins on the date the employee physically reports for duty  at  the new PDS and ends  on the one-year anniversary of the report-for-duty date. (JTR, par. 5908-C3) For example, the one-year time limit for an employee who physically reports for duty on Wednesday, 6 November 2013, is 6 November 2014. 2.22.3.3.2.  Waiver  requests  will  be  addressed  case-by-case;  the  AF  has  broad discretion about whether to approve a waiver. The waiver applicant should explain, in detail,  why  the  extenuating  circumstances  caused  the  delay,  i.e.,  what  made   46  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 transaction  completion  unavoidable  within  the  one-year  period.  The  employee  must submit  supporting  documentation  with  the  waiver  request  to  the  authorizing/order-issuing  official  prior  to  the  expiration  of  the  initial  one-year  period.  (T-3). AFPC/FMAC  Resources  Office  (AFPCDPIEAResourcesOffice@us.af.mil)  is  the authorizing/order issuing official for all CF’s except the AOCMP, which is managed by AFRC/A1C. Example: to support a waiver request based on a depressed housing market as the "extenuating circumstance," the AF should consider, and the applicant should  address  with  supporting  documentation,  whether  the  decline  in  the  housing market was as severe as the employee suggested. 2.23.  PCS  Relocation  Services.  AF  is  authorized  to  offer  relocation  services  to  eligible  employees (JTR,  par.  5924).  The  DoD  National  Relocation  Program  (DNRP),  for  which  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of Engineers (USACE) is the DoD Executive Agent, provides services through third-party contractors.  The National  Relocation  Program  Office  (NRPO)  located  in  the  USACE  Baltimore  District  Real  Estate Division  administers is  available  at: http://www.nab.usace.army.mil/BusinessWithUs/RealEstate/DNRP.aspx..

GHS Qualifying Tour Considerations: 2.23.2.1.  The move must be from one location to another in the U.S. (including Alaska, Hawaii  and the District  of Columbia), or  in  a non-foreign  area, such  as the Canal  Zone area, or a U.S. territory or possession (e.g., Guam). 2.23.2.2.  An  employee  who  returns  from  a  completed  tour  of  duty  from  a  foreign  PDS and is reassigned/transferred to a different CONUS or non-foreign OCONUS PDS, other than the one from which the employee transferred when assigned to the foreign PDS may be eligible for GHS. 2.23.2.3.  Various employees are not  eligible, e.g., a new  appointee (JTR, par. 5926-B). Employees who traveled overseas on a first duty station move and employees who were hired locally overseas are not eligible. (JTR, par. 5908-D3). 2.23.3.  GHS and Residence  Criteria. DNRP Guidelines  (DNRP  Handbook, Sec 7,  Para. II) state the employee's residence (former residence for overseas returnees from a foreign area) must meet requirements under the JTR, Chap. 5, Part B14 and the residence must be: 2.23.3.1.  Located in the U.S., including U.S. territories and possessions. 2.23.3.2.

DNRP GHS-AF Pre-Enrollment 60-Day Listing of Property.   48  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 2.23.4.1.  AF  requires  an  eligible  employee  who  elects  to  enroll  in  GHS  to  market  the home  for  sixty  (60)  days  (from  the  date  of  listing)  prior  to  enrolling  in  DNRP  GHS. Following the AF imposed 60-day marketing period, and once the employee is enrolled in  the  DNRP  GHS,  DNRP  requires  an  eligible  employee  to  market  the  home  for  an additional sixty (60) days prior to accepting the GHS offer. 2.23.4.2.  The listing agreement must include an exclusion clause to allow the employee to  cancel  the  agreement  without  incurring  a  broker’s  commission  should  the  employee elect to accept the appraised value offer. The clause also permits the employee to assign an offer to the contractor relocation company to relieve the employee of the responsibility of closing the sale with the buyer. An employee who receives an acceptable offer for the property  based  on  appraised  fair  market  values  within  the  60-day  AF-imposed  pre-enrollment  marketing  period  will  not  be  enrolled  in  DNRP  GHS.  Instead,  AF  will reimburse the employee for the home sale based on the employee's authorization for real estate benefits on the PCS orders. (JTR, par. 5908). 2.23.5.  GHS/DNRP Enrollment Time Limit. 2.23.5.1.  An eligible employee must elect to use GHS and complete the sale transaction prior  to  the  one-year  real  estate  time  limit.  (DNRP  Handbook,  Section  3,  Para.  III). DNRP  program  office  will  not  consummate  sale  transaction  beyond  the  one-year  JTR limit for sale transactions. It is the employee's responsibility to seek a waiver to the one-year time period  for real estate transactions with  evidence of extenuating circumstances that the AF finds acceptable due to unavoidable circumstances. See 2.22.3.3. for details regarding waiver requests for one-year limit on real estate sale/purchase transactions. 2.23.5.2.  Due  to  GHS  marketing  requirements  and  administrative  processing  timelines, an eligible employee should enroll NLT 120 days before the one-year expiration date to allow  time  for  AF-imposed  60-day  home  marketing  plus  the  60-day  DNRP-required home marketing plus completion of sale transactions. 2.23.6.  GHS Application Procedures. An employee who meets eligibility requirements must navigate to the DNRP web address:  http://www.nab.usace.army.mil/BusinessWithUs/RealEstate/DNRP.aspx  and  select  the DNRP Online Relocation Services Request Form. 2.23.6.1.  All eligible employees are required to complete the HR POC info on the DNRP Online  Relocation  Services  Request  Form.  Applicants  funded  by  AFPC  must  cite  the POC  name  listed  in  block  28,  Item  G,  of  the  PCS  order  and  include  the  email  address AFPCDPIEARESOURCESOFFICE@us.af.mil. 2.23.6.2.  Air  Reserve  Technician  Officer  Career  Management  Program  applicants  must cite  the  POC  name  provided  by  AFRC/A1CS  staff  and  include  the  email  address: afrc.a1csa@us.af.mil. 2.23.6.3.  All applications are to be submitted to the DNRP office and the applicant is to provide:  1) a copy of the Listing Agreement (if already available); 2) an Addendum to Listing Agreement from the DNRP website; and 3) a copy of the PCS order authorizing Relocation Services. AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   49  2.23.6.4.  The  DNRP  office  provides  an  auto-generated  e-mail  application  to  the  orders approving  official  (AFPC/FMAC  or  AFRC/A1CS)  who  processes  the  action  (e.g.,  adds fund citation) and returns the approved application to the DNRP office for further action with  one of the contractor companies.  In turn, a DNRP services counselor contacts the employee and explains the available services. 2.23.6.5.  GHS Residential Sale. For sale situations involving a divorce or separation, or title held with other than an eligible family member or dependent, contact AFPC/FMAC (AFRC/A1CS  for  ART  Officers)  for  further  information  regarding  limited  pro  rata reimbursement. (JTR, par. 5908-H2). 2.23.7.  Home  Marketing  Incentive  Payment  (HMIP).    For  employees  with  PCS  orders that reflect an EOD date on or after 1 Mar 14, AF does not authorize use of HMIP. Alternatively, homeowners may use the DNRP GHS after marketing the residence for 120 days (AF 60-day requirement  before  enrollment  plus  60-day  DNRP  requirement  once  enrolled),  or  they  may use the Real Estate entitlement for reimbursement of allowed closing costs during a residence sale. (JTR, par. 5908). 2.23.8.  Property  Management  Services.  An  employee  transferring  to  a  centrally  managed position,  who  meets  the  DNRP  GHS  eligibility  requirements,  may  select  Property Management  (PRPM)  services  in  lieu  of  GHS.  An  employee  may  self-procure  PRPM services  through  a  rental  agency  and  be  reimbursed  up  to  10  percent  of  the  monthly  rent. (JTR,  par.  5930-C).  The  AF  ordering-authorizing  or  authenticating  official  may  approve PRPM services. An employee who elects to use PRPM services may later sell the residence within  the  applicable  time  limits.  (JTR,  par.  5908-C).  However,  an  employee  may  not  use GHS pursuant to the same PCS orders. The reimbursement amount an employee receives for the  sale  of  a  residence  may  not  exceed  the  maximum  amount  allowed  (JTR,  par.  5912-B1) less  the  amount  paid  for  PRPM  services.  If  the  amount  paid  for  PRPM  services equals/exceeds the maximum amount allowed (JTR, par. 5912-B1), then no reimbursement is allowed for the residence sale (JTR, pars. 5908-A2 and 5934-D). 2.24.  Administrative Responsibilities. 2.24.1.  CFTs. CFTs centrally administer managerial/leadership training and development for CF employees and centrally funded force renewal positions. This training and development includes  selected  CB  and  career  enhancing  assignments,  job  rotation,  short-  and  long-term training,  management  and  executive  seminars,  education,  and  self-improvement  activities intended  to  systematically  develop  employees  for  filling  AF  positions  of  increased responsibility. 2.24.2.  Local Base Training Offices. Local base training offices retain the responsibility for funding and administering tactical level training, such as that required for job proficiency. 2.24.3.  CFT  Training  and  Development  Course  Listing.  The  myPers  website  is  populated with  courses  offered,  nomination  due  dates,  specific  eligibility  criteria  and  application procedures for all training and development opportunities offered by the CFTs. 2.24.4.  Career Paths. CFTs develop and maintain career planning diagrams which represent specific  progression  possibilities  from  entry-level  positions  to  career  positions  at  the  SES level. Individual CF chapters may contain specific career planning diagrams, or refer to the AF Civilian Leadership Development Continuum diagram at Attachment 2.   50  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 2.25.  Funding.  The  AF  centrally  funds  key  training  and  development  opportunities  for  CFs. AF/A1XY is the program element manager for all AF civilian training funds, and they provide AFPC  with  budget  authority  for  their  programs.  The  AFPC  Resource  section  submits  budgets and financial plans based on requirements developed by individual CFTs as well as the needs of other centrally managed programs. CFTs and other centrally managed programs prioritize their training  requirements  and  submit  their  requests  through  the  AFPC  Resource  section,  which processes those requests, pays training providers and tracks overall training funds. 2.26.  Continued Service Agreement (CSA).  AFPC will initiate a CSA for all employees who attend  training  over  80  hours  that  is  funded  or  managed  by  CFTs.  Refer  to  AFI  36-401, Employee Training and Development, for specific guidance. 2.27.  Repayment  of  Training  Funds.  Employees who fail  to attend or  successfully complete scheduled  training  due  to  circumstances  within  their  control  must  reimburse  the  AF  for  all training  costs  (excluding  salary)  associated  with  their  attendance.  AFPC,  the  final  training authority, may waive this requirement in whole, or in part, based on the employee's justification. 2.28.  Short-Term  Training  (STT).  Short-term  training  consists  of  training  for  less  than  120 consecutive duty days accomplished either in government or non-government facilities. 2.29.  Long-Term  Training  (LTT).  Long-term  training  is  full-time,  in-residence,  off-the-job training that consists of more than 120 consecutive duty days accomplished either in government or  non-government  facilities.  The  intent  of  LTT  is  to  develop  selected  employees  in  order  to keep the AF abreast of professional, managerial, technical and scientific achievements. Available programs  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  those  offered  through  Civilian  Developmental Education (CDE) (i.e., Professional Military Education (PME), fellowships, and specific college graduate programs). They may also include attendance at the AF Institute of Technology (AFIT) graduate programs, Education with Industry (EWI), or programs tailored to the specific needs of a CF. 2.30.  Civilian  Developmental  Education  (CDE).  Most  long-term  civilian  education  and development  is  offered  through  CDE  (AFI  36-2301,  Developmental  Education).  CDE  includes long-term  academic  programs  at  major  universities,  experiential  programs  such  as  the  DoD Executive Leadership Development Program, the Excellence in Government Fellows and RAND Fellowships,  Professional  Military  Education  (PME)  and  Executive  Development  Programs. PME includes both Intermediate and Senior Service Schools. TDY costs for CDE employees are centrally funded. Salaries of individuals selected for LTT through CDE are funded through the Central  Salary  Account,  enabling  management  to  fill  behind  the  selectee  during  the  period  of LTT. All eligible AF employees may apply for these programs. 2.30.1.  Competitive Selection. Nominations for CDE are solicited in the spring of each year. Employees  must  submit  an  AF  Form  4059,  Air  Force  Civilian  Competitive  Development Nomination Form, or electronic nomination form, signed by their supervisor and endorsed by their wing commander (or equivalent with senior rater authority) or the first SES/GO in their chain of command. The DT is responsible for recommending specific courses, rank-ordering applicants  for  various  programs,  and  providing  meaningful  outplacement  assignments  upon graduation. Nominees are then evaluated by a board comprised of senior executives/general officers  representing  the  various  functional  communities,  who  rate  candidates  for  selection and  determine  which  courses  or  development  opportunities  selectees  should  attend.  The Developmental Education Designation Board (DEDB) approves selections. AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   51  2.30.2.  Continued Service Agreement (CSA). A CSA is necessary for all CDE programs and courses. Employees sign the AF CSA, Attachment 11 of AFI 36-401, Employee Training and Development. The continued service period does not begin until the first duty day following completion  of  the  program  or  course.  The  standard  service  commitments  for  CDE  are  as follows: 2.30.2.1.  Short-term Executive Development – one year. 2.30.2.2.  Long-term programs less than $40,000 – three years. 2.30.2.3.  Long-term programs between $40,000 and $59,999 – four years. 2.30.2.4.  Long-term programs $60,000 or more – five years. 2.30.3.  LTT Follow-on Assignment. Employees attending LTT through CDE are expected to move to positions that best utilize their newly acquired skills and meet the mission needs of the Air Force. The endorsing official on the AF Form 4059, Air Force Civilian Competitive Development Nomination Form, or electronic nomination form, recommends an appropriate follow-on  assignment  which  is  either  validated  by  the  DT  or  the  DT  will  recommend  an alternative outplacement assignment using other developmental programs which may include CSLP, CB assignment or KCP. The CF team and DT are responsible for outplacement of the employee. Refer to AFI 36-2640, chapter 3, for specific outplacement guidance. Section F - Acquisition Professional Development Program (APDP) 2.31.  Concept.  The  Defense  Acquisition  Workforce  Improvement  Act  (DAWIA),  November 1990,  provided  centralized  management  and  professional  development,  education,  training  and career  opportunities  to  the  acquisition  workforce.  In  order  to  maintain  the  highest  professional standards  among  acquisition  workforce  members,  requirements  in  education,  training  and experience were established for every type of acquisition position. The requirements are listed in AFI  63-101/20-101,  Chapter  9,  Acquisition  Workforce  Management  and  Professional Development  and  AFI  36-1301  (DODD  5000.52),  Management  of  Acquisition  Key  Leadership Positions. Specific information may be found on the SAF/AQ APDP web site. 2.32.  CFT  Roles.  The  Acquisition-related  CFTs  within  AFPC  are  responsible  for  ensuring DAWIA and DoD requirements are applied in the competitive processes for centrally managed acquisition  positions;  performing  quality  reviews  of  records  of  employees  certified  to  ensure consistency across  command  lines;  and  answering  or  resolving  questions  concerning  creditable experience or training. CFTs must ensure the legal requirements of DAWIA are met when filling acquisition positions. DAWIA requirements that should be met for acquisition positions include the  appropriate  APDP  certification  level  in  the  correct  functional  discipline,  Acquisition  Corps membership  for  critical  acquisition  positions  and  statutory  requirements  for  KLPs.  DT  Chairs may  require  CFT  review  of  waiver  requests  prior  to  submission  to  the  Director  of  Acquisition Career Management (DACM). Section G - Grievances and Complaints 2.33.  Employee Complaints.  Commanders/Civilian Equivalents will ensure that all complaints (other than EEO complaints), grievances, and appeals concerning CF issues or centrally managed positions receive the coordination and approval of the respective DT Chair prior to final action and IAW AFMAN 36-203, para 2.27.  EEO complaints regarding administration of CF issues are   52  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 to be handled IAW AFPD 36-27, Equal Opportunity (EO) and AFI 36-2706, Equal Opportunity Program, Military and Civilian. 2.34.  Settlement  of  Disputes.  Commanders/Civilian  Equivalents  will  ensure  that  settlement negotiations in a local dispute involving a CF’s policies or positions receive the coordination and approval  of  the  CF’s  DT  Chair  and  the  Director,  AFPC,  prior  to  finalizing  the  agreement. Commanders/Civilian  Equivalents  will  ensure  that  settlement  agreements  without  this  required approval are not  processed until  approval  is  received.  (T-3). This  includes the placement of an individual into a centrally managed position as part of the settlement agreement. Section H - Program Evaluation 2.35.  Periodic  Evaluation.  Periodic  evaluations  are  accomplished  by  functional  chiefs  or managers  and  each  CF  Advisory  Council.  Self-evaluation  by  AFPC  and  CFTs  is  based  on  an analysis  of  progress  in  meeting  stated  Functional  Advisory  Council  or  Executive  Board  objectives, to include defining customer requirements, analyzing performance of work processes and  implementing  measures  to  streamline/continuously  improve  personnel  management servicing. AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   53  Chapter 3 3. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT (PM) CF PROGRAM (CFP) 3.1.  Scope.  This chapter is limited to personnel assigned to CFID “R.”  If a topic is not covered in (https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/login/redirect/home) for additional information. the  myPers  website this chapter, see  Chapter 2 or 3.2.  CF  Mission.  The  PM  CFT  plays  a  critical  role  in  developing  civilians  to  support  current and projected mission capabilities. Program Managers lead and manage AF programs to deliver and sustain AF warfighting capabilities. PM duties touch every aspect of the acquisition process, including  technology  development  and  integrating  engineering,  program  control,  test  and deployment,  configuration  management,  production  and  manufacturing,  quality  assurance  and logistics  support.  Program  Managers  serve  in  a  variety  of  capacities,  primarily  in  program offices. As they gain acquisition experience and demonstrate leadership, business and technical acumen, individual responsibilities should include planning, organizing and developing program management techniques and determining organizational structure, personnel, training needs and security  requirements.  Ensuring  acquisition  programs  meet  cost,  schedule  and  performance objectives is critical to the success of this CF. 3.3.  CF  Governance  Structure.  The  Program  Management  Advisory  Council  (PMAC) provides  oversight  of  the  acquisition  PM  workforce.  The  Advisory  Council  addresses  force development and CF management initiatives and issues impacting the entire CF. This ensures the workforce  is  being  developed  in  a  manner  to  produce  effective  leaders  through  planned development activities, and ensures career paths are clear and compatible with opportunities and the  needs  of  the  AF.  The  PM  CFT  and  Military  Assignments  Team  located  at  AFPC  present workforce issues for resolution through the CF Manager. Table 3.1.  Advisory Council Composition.

Executive  Panels.  The  PMAC  may  establish  ad  hoc  panels  to  formulate  various enhancement  and  development  initiatives,  identify  concerns  and  provide  recommendations. Senior acquisition personnel from across the AF, with support from the CFT, participate on the panels. 3.3.2.  DT.  The  Functional  Manager  establishes  DTs  to  provide  and  execute  education, training  and  experience  vectors  to  foster  development  of  employees  in  the  PM  CF.  The PMAC  appoints  members  of  the  Civilian  DT.  Roles  and  responsibilities  for  the  DT  are defined  in  AFI  36-2640  and  specifics  are  documented  in  the  CF’s  DT  Charter.  Two permanent DTs are established: 3.3.2.1.  Senior Level. The PMAC serves as the Senior Level DT and vectors GS-15 and equivalent  employees.  The  team  also  assesses  candidates  for  the  AF-wide  competitive development programs. 3.3.2.2.  Intermediate  Level.  A  panel  composed  of  GS-15  and  equivalent  members designated  by  the  PMAC  serves  as  the  Intermediate  Level  DT  for  GS-13/14  and equivalent employees who meet the technical breadth and depth anchors. This is chaired by the CFM, SAF/AQH or designee. 3.4.  CF Unique Positions. 3.4.1.  PM Key Leadership Positions (KLP) and Administration.  AFI 36-1301, Management of  Acquisition  Key  Leadership  Positions  (KLPs),  provides  guidance  for  the  executive  level management of KLPs, a subset of Critical Acquisition Positions (CAPs). This instruction also describes  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  AF  Personnel  Assignment/Employment  Teams, and other participants, in the qualification for assignments to and management of KLPs. 3.4.1.1.  Developmental Entry-Level Programs. 3.4.1.1.1.  PALACE Acquire (PAQ) Intern Program. The PM CFT is responsible for the  recruitment,  development  and  training  of  all  PM  PAQ  interns.

Pathways  participants  normally  enter  the  PM CFT at the GS-04 to GS-05 grades. Upon satisfactory completion of the degree and training program, participants may be non-competitively converted to a GS-07 to GS-12  PAQ  position.  Non-competitive  conversion  of  a  Pathways  Program  position  is dependent on the accession needs and availability of permanent placement positions within the PM CFT. 3.5.  CF Unique Requirement.  Using the Master Development Plan/Developmental Template, the  CF  Manager  (SAF/AQH)  develops  and  maintains  a  63A-1101  Acquisition  Managers  CF Education and Training Plan (CFETP) to guide individuals toward the experience, education and training important for successful performance and career progression. The CFETP is mandatory through  the  grade  of  GS-12.  The  CFETP  identifies  education  and  self-development  activities, acquisition certification levels, desired training and typical assignments for entry-level, mid-level and senior-level acquisition/program managers. The CFETP is maintained in e-Pubs and on the AF  Portal-Acquisition functional  area-Acquisition  Program  Management  CF  page, http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/saf_aq/publication/cfetp63ax-1101/cfetp63ax-1101.pdf. 3.6.

Scope.  This chapter is limited to personnel assigned to CFID “D.” If a topic is not covered in this chapter, see Chapter 1. 4.2.  CF  Mission.  The  Civil  Engineer  CF  Team  (CECFT)  plays  a  critical  role  in  developing civilians  to  support  current  and  projected  mission  capabilities.  The  CECFT  implements  policy established  by  the  Civil  Engineer  (CE)  Functional  Advisory  Council  and  engages  with  the  CE workforce  to  help  achieve  career  objectives  for over  12,000  civilians.  The  CECFT  works  to provide  the  framework  to  build  and  maintain  a  professional  civil  engineer  civilian  workforce with the CE capabilities necessary to accomplish AF missions. The mission of AF Civil Engineer is  to  maintain  an  installation’s  physical  plant  through  all  life  cycle  phases  to  include  planning, acquiring,  sustaining,  managing,  operating  and  divesting.  The  physical  plant  is  comprised  of buildings,  support  facilities,  real  property  and  infrastructure  such  as  roads,  runways  and  utility systems.  Additionally,  Civil  Engineers  manage  natural  resources  such  as  air,  land  and  water  to ensure installations have the natural assets necessary to support current and future missions. The CE  CF  encompasses  a  large  number  of  occupational  areas  beyond  the  civil  engineering discipline  (0810  series)  such  as  architects,  electrical  engineers,  realty  specialists,  housing managers,  environmental  professionals,  financial  managers,  biologists,  community  planners, firefighters,  electricians,  carpenters,  painters  and  more.  To  find  the  most  up-to-date  CE information, see the CECFT SharePoint site at https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-MS-AF-25. 4.3.  CF  Governance  Structure.  The  CE  Functional  Advisory  Council  (FAC)  provides oversight of the civil engineer workforce on matters pertaining to recruiting, force development, requirements and retention. The CE FAC works to ensure the civilian workforce can develop in a manner  capable  of  producing  effective  leaders.  Through  the  CE  FAC,  human  capital  strategies are created, CF management initiatives are implemented and career paths are developed to meet the needs of the AF. Additional information on CE FAC responsibilities and authorities can be found in the FAC charter available on the CECFT SharePoint site. 4.3.1.  Advisory Council Composition. The CE FAC is composed of members from the CE community  as  well  as  members  from  staff  agencies.  The  AF  Deputy  Civil  Engineer (AF/A7C2)  will  chair  the  CE  FAC,  the  Civil  Engineer  CF  Manager  (CE  CFM)  will  be  the vice chair, and it should be comprised of senior civilian* representatives from the Air Staff, Major Commands (MAJCOMs) and the CE Field Operating Agency (FOA).   58  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 Table 4.1.

PALACE  Acquire  (PAQ)  Internship.  AFI  36-602  addresses  the  various  intern programs (i.e., COPPER CAP, PALACE Acquire, etc.), and the methods and procedures for recruiting, selecting, training, evaluating, promoting and separating CF Team’s interns. 5.5.  CF Unique Requirements.  Commanders/Civilian Equivalents will ensure that any unique or  additional  position  requirements  are  covered  in  the  job’s  position  description  or  position coding. 5.6.  Career  Paths  and  Career  Progression  Models.  The  Force  Support  Force  Development Model covers the following: 5.6.1.  Development Path. During the first ten years, civilians should develop solid technical and operational experience. A functional leader should gain technical competencies in their core  occupational  area  at  different  organizational  levels,  i.e.,  Installation,  MAJCOM,  FOA and/or  Air  Staff,  as  well  as  different  geographic  locations.  To  be  an  enterprise  leader,  the Force  Support  civilian  should  gain  depth  and  subject  matter  expertise  in  their  chosen occupation  up  through  the  GS-12  and  GS-13  grade  levels  and  then  begin  gaining  breadth. Members should acquire experience in two of three core functional areas (personnel, services and  manpower).  To  be  competitive  as  a  force  support  functional  leader,  employees  should complete  a  flight  chief  assignment  in:  Airman  and  Family  Services,  Community  Services, Force  Development,  Sustainment  Services  or  Manpower  and  Personnel.  These  flights provide  significant  tests  in  leadership,  organization  and  resource  management,  and  develop core functional expertise. 5.6.2.  Education. Attaining grade appropriate formal and military education is paramount to developing credible and competent leaders. To be most competitive, GS-09s through GS-13s should have attained a bachelor’s degree and GS-14s through GS-15s should have attained a master’s  degree.  GS-09s  through  GS-11s  are  expected  to  complete  Basic  Development Education  (BDE),  GS-12s  through  GS-13s  are  expected  to  complete  Intermediate Developmental  Education  (IDE)  and  GS-14s  through  GS-15s  are  expected  to  complete Senior Developmental Education (SDE). 5.6.3.  Mobility. Functional leaders may remain at a single location; however, opportunities may  be  limited.  Organizational  and  functional  mobility  are  key  elements  of  enterprise leadership in order for the Force Support civilian to gain a broad perspective of the AF. CB, KCP and CDE are used to enhance civilian development and typically require geographical mobility. AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   63  Figure 5.1.

Functional Advisory Council (FAC) Structure.  The Career Management Board (CMB) serves  as  the  Advisory  Council  for  the  Air  Reserve  Technician  Officer  Career  Management Program (AOCMP). 19.1.1.  The AFRC/CC chairs the CMB. The Board is composed of AFRC/CV, AFRC/CCC, 4 AF/CC, 10 AF/CC, 22 AF/CC and AFRC/DS. AFRC/A1 and AFRC/FM attend the CMB as advisory members. Only primaries may attend unless otherwise approved by AFRC/CC. 19.1.2.  The CMB approves and provides overall policy guidance on education, training and experience equating to force management and development of AF Reserve (AFR) personnel regardless  of  reserve  status,  i.e.  Air  Reserve  Technician  (ART),  Active  Guard  Reserve (AGR), Traditional Reservist (TA) or Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA). The board also  develops  objectives,  requirements,  guidance,  planned  assignments  and  career progression for reserve high potential officers, regardless of status. As necessary, the Board reviews  the  progress  and  metrics  of  fielded  programs  to  ensure  established  objectives  are satisfied. 19.2.  Executive Panels.  AFR Force Management and Development Council (AFR FMDC) and the Force Management Development Working Group (FMD WG) are the established executive panels and make up the first two levels of the CMB tri-level hierarchy. 19.2.1.  The  AFR  FMDC  reviews  and/or  develops  proposed  policy  guidance  on  education, training and experience equating to force management and development of AFR personnel. As  necessary,  the  Council  reviews  the  progress  and  metrics  of  fielded  programs  to  ensure established  objectives  are  satisfied.  It  also  provides  oversight  and  manages  taskings  and efforts of the AFR FMD Working Group (AFR FMD WG). The AFR FMDC is chaired by the  AFRC/CV  and  composed  of  AFRC/DSD,  AF/REG,  AF/REP,  AF/REX,  ARPC/CC, RMG/CC,  HQ  AFRC/A1,  HQ  AFRC  A-Staff  Directors  and  a  wing  commander  and  wing command chief from each Numbered Air Force (NAF) serving as the NAF representative for a  two-year  tour.  An  AFRC/FM  representative  attends  the  AFR  FMDC  as  an  advisory member. Attendance is for primaries only. 19.2.2.  The  AFR  FMD  WG  is  the  entry  point  for  all  initiatives  on  education,  training  and experience equating to force management and development of AFR personnel. As necessary, the  AFR  FMDWG  reviews  the  progress  and  metrics  of  fielded  programs  to  ensure established  objectives  are  satisfied.  The  AFR  FMD  WG  is  chaired  by  the  AFRC/A1K  and composed  of  AF/REG,  AF/REPP,  AF/REXX,  AFRC/A1D,  AFRC/A1C,  AFRC/A1L, AFRC/A1M,  ARPC/DPA,  IR-RIO/CC,  three  CFM  representatives  and  three  MFM representatives.  The  AFRC/FM  representative  attends  the  AFR  FMD  WG  as  an  advisory member. 19.3.  Centrally Managed Positions and Career Program Referral. 19.3.1.  All  ART  Officer  positions  are  centrally  managed.  No  other  AF  career  program includes  ART  positions.  Filling  ART  Officer  positions through is  accomplished AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   109  AFRC/A1CSA,  who  serves  as  the  trusted  agent  of  the  CMB.  Generally,  entry-level  and trainee positions should be filled from external sources, such as ART Special Examining Unit (SEU)  competitive  certificates,  Veterans  Readjustment  Appointment  (VRA),  VEOA, reinstatement candidates, etc. 19.3.2.  AFRC  acquires,  develops  and  retains  a  qualified,  productive  and  well-motivated managerial  force  of  ART  officers  capable  of  assuring  the  success  of  varied  and  ever-changing missions. 19.3.3.  Local  AFR  commanders,  assisted  by  CPSs  and  AFPC,  manage  all  AFRC  positions not centrally managed by AFRC and the career development of AFRC personnel not covered by  this  program.  This  includes  ART  enlisted  positions  and  non-ART  positions  and  the assigned  individuals.  For  AFRC  positions/employees  not  covered  by  AOCMP,  AFPC provides  referral  certificates  to  selecting  officials  through the  local  merit  promotion  system or other authorized recruitment sources. 19.4.  Career Mobility/Mobility for  Key Positions.  AFR command-wide geographic mobility is a condition of employment for all ART officer positions. Before assignment for any covered position,  each  employee  or  appointee  must  sign  a  Mobility  Certificate  committing  to  accept assignment to AFRC jobs at other locations. The form is Air Reserve Technician (ART) Program Certificate of Understanding, AFRC Form 121. The AOCMP places personal and career needs of the individual subordinate only to the best interests of AFRC when determining assignments. 19.5.  Management Initiated Reassignments.  AFRC/CC/CV is in the direct supervisory chain of all ART officers. All ART officers must sign a command-wide mobility agreement; therefore, AFRC/CC/CV maintains the authority to direct the reassignment of any and all ART officers to positions  for  which  they  qualify.  AFRC  must  approve  all  permanent  ART  officer  actions,  e.g., reassignment,  promotion,  change  to  lower  grade  and  initial  appointment.  The  filling  of  ART officer  positions  by  temporary  promotions,  which  exceed  120  days,  is  through  career  program referral. In unusual situations, AFRC/CC/CV may approve reassignments/change to lower grade outside the auspices of the career program, in which case the employee would not be entitled to pay  retention,  Relocation  Services  (RS)  Program  or  Home  Marketing  Incentive  Program (HMIP). A PCS may be allowed, but IAW the JTR management may elect not to offer a house hunting trip or TQSE. 19.6.  Training and Development. 19.6.1.  Employees may acquire training and experience by the following methods: 19.6.1.1.  Classroom  instruction,  correspondence  courses,  on-the-job  training  and  self- development. 19.6.1.2.  Details and temporary promotions or other assignments. 19.6.1.3.  Long-Term Training (LTT); college or university short courses; Air Education and Training Command; AFIT, OPM and other government training opportunities. 19.6.2.  Developmental  Education  (DE),  formerly  PME,  courses  are  beneficial  to  career development objectives of ART officers. Officers should plan for  and complete DE courses by  in-residence  seminar  or  by  correspondence  during  appropriate  phases  of  their  careers. ART  officers  may  apply  for  DE  in  either  a  military  or  civilian  status  IAW  applicable  Air Force Instructions. Courses are identified in AFI 36-2301, Developmental Education.   110  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 19.6.3.  A  vital  element  in  the  career  progression  of  ART  officers  is  an  active  duty assignment under Title 10. Each ART officer  should  plan for  such  a tour  and actively seek selection, as opportunities are available. 19.7.  Career Paths. 19.7.1.  Security. Series 0080. 19.7.2.  Intelligence Specialist.

An ART is a full-time civilian employee who, as a condition of employment, must be an active member in the AFR unit in which employed. The individual's assigned  Reserve  position  is  identical  to,  or  so  closely  related  to,  the  civilian  position  that either  position  substantially  requires  the  same  basic  knowledge  and  skills.  The  military nature of the ART officer position creates a uniqueness that dictates consideration of both the civilian  and  military  aspects  of  the  position.  Therefore,  determination  of  assignments includes consideration of the "whole person." Commanders/Civilian Equivalents will ensure that  all  planning  and  scheduling  of  assignments  complies  with  laws  and  regulations governing civilian employees, despite military responsibilities. 19.8.2.  Goals. The primary goal of the program is to acquire, develop and retain a qualified, productive and motivated managerial force of ART officers capable of assuring the success of varied and changing missions. 19.8.3.  Objectives. The objectives of the program are to: 19.8.3.1.  Survey projected losses of ART officers in all grades. 19.8.3.2.

All ART officer positions are covered under the ART Officer Career Management Program (AOCMP); therefore, registration in AOCMP is not required. 19.8.7.  Staffing Positions: 19.8.7.1.  As far in  advance as  possible,  the supervisor submits a Request for Personnel Action (RPA/SF-52) to the servicing CPS to fill a position on a permanent basis, unless the unit commander wants to delay the action. The local CPS clears local priorities and routes the RPA to AFRC/A1CSA general inbox (9RHQAFRC-BPR). The AFRC staffer will then clear the PPP and proceed with filling the existing or anticipated vacancy. 19.8.7.2.  AFRC/A1CSA, as requested by the selecting supervisor and CPS: 19.8.7.2.1.  Prepares  and  issues  a  vacancy  announcement,  which  is  open  for  a specified  period  of  time  (e.g.,  five  work  days)  during  which  time  interested  AF permanent  employees  nominate  themselves  for  possible  consideration.  After  the announcement  closing  or  cut-off  date,  AFRC/A1CSA  screens  candidates  based  on military and civilian qualifications, and identifies qualified candidates for promotion (or,  as  appropriate,  competitive  reassignment/change  to  lower  grade)  and  refers  all qualified candidates to the selecting supervisor. 19.8.7.2.2.  AFRC/A1CSA  utilizes  appropriate  personnel  systems  such  as  USA Staffing, Modern Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS), AFR (military or BR) Data System, etc. Further detailed guidance is contained in appropriate AFRC guidance (e.g., AFRCI 36-111). 19.8.7.2.3.  As  appropriate,  requests  an  OPM  certificate  of  eligible  candidates  from the  ART  SEU  or  other  appropriate  sources  (e.g.,  VRA,  VEOA,  reinstatement, transfer,  etc.).  Determines  each  applicant's  availability  and  makes  a  preliminary review  of  former  and  present  military  status  to  determine  tentative  eligibility  for Reserve assignment. 19.8.7.2.4.  As  appropriate,  refers  candidates  from  other  sources  (e.g.,  VEOA,  VRA and reinstatement candidates). 19.8.7.3.  As  appropriate,  the  selecting  supervisor  may  request  the  vacancy  be  re-announced.  Appropriate  waiting  period  may  be  required.  (e.g.,  announce  after  closing date, 30 days, etc.). 19.8.7.4.  Selections are tentative until AFRC approval has been obtained. The servicing CPS/AFPC processes the action. 19.8.7.5.  Proposed  management-directed  assignments  to  ART  officer  positions  require AFRC approval prior to the action being effected. 19.8.8.  PCS. Because ART officers must sign a mobility agreement, employees selected for an ART officer position requiring a geographical move receive a paid move (to include first duty  station  move)  IAW  the  JTR.  AFRC/A1CSA  manages  centralized  funds  for  the Relocation  Services  (RS)  program  portion  of  PCS  moves  made  under  the  AOCMP.  The appropriate Unit funds other entitlements for PCS moves. AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   115  19.8.9.  Overseas  Assignments  and  ART  Eligibility.  ARTs  going  to  non-ART  overseas positions have return rights to their ART position only if they are still militarily qualified. If an  ART  loses  Reserve  status,  or  is  unwilling  to  accept  placement  into  their  previous  ART position, ARFC will provide return placement into the ART position and take action for an employee  who  is  ineligible  or  unwilling  to  maintain  active  Reserve  membership.  In determining  active  Reserve  eligibility  and  continued  employment  in  the  ART  position, employees should be treated as though they never left the ART position. Employees are not automatically  entitled  to  a  non-ART  position  if  they  are  no  longer  eligible  or  willing  to maintain Reserve eligibility. 19.8.10.  Supplemental  Guidance.  AFRC  will  provide  further  guidance/instruction  as appropriate (e.g., AFRCI 36-111). 19.8.11.

The Pathways Program (Intern) is the CF’s Developmental Entry-Level  Program.  Pathways  participants  normally  enter  the  WCF  at  the  GS-04  to  GS-05  grades. Upon  satisfactory  completion  of  the  degree  and  training  program,  participants  may  be  non-competitively  converted  to  a  GS-07  to  GS-12  position.  Non-competitive  conversion  of  a Pathways  Program  Intern  is  dependent  on  the  accession  needs  and  availability  of  permanent placement positions within the WCF. 20.5.  CF  Unique  Requirements.  Unique  WCF  position  requirements  are  covered  in  the applicable position description and/or position coding. 20.6.  Career  Paths  and  Progression  Models.  The Weather CFM develops and maintains the Weather  career  field  development  roadmap  to  guide  WCF  civilians  towards  experience, education  and  training  important  for  successful  performance  and  career  progression.  The development  roadmap  suggests  education  and  self-development  activities,  desired  training  and typical assignments for entry-level, mid-level and senior-level WCF personnel.   118  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 Figure 20.1.

CF  Mission.  The  mission  of  the  Operations  Career  Program  is  to  train,  develop  and prepare civilians to execute operational policy; develop and integrate operational strategies, plans and  concepts;  and  determine,  validate  and  develop  capability  requirements  to  execute  National Military Strategy. The vision of the Ops CFP strives to have a diverse, skilled and experienced civilian  workforce  that  possesses  the  capabilities  to  successfully  achieve  current  and  future Operations  and  AF  mission  requirements.  The  Operations  CF  encompasses  over  20  different occupational series in both white and blue collar occupations. The Ops CF includes assignments in aircraft, space and cyberspace operations and management that analyze, maintain and support weapon  systems  worldwide;  execute  operational  policy;  develop  and  integrate  operational strategies,  plans  and  concepts;  and  determine,  validate  and  develop  capability  requirements  to execute  national  military  strategy.  Each  functional  area  provides  the  foundational  knowledge, skill  and  experience  combined  with  technical  education  requirements  necessary  to  support  the AF  mission.  To  find  the  most  up-to-date  information  on  this  CF,  see  myPers  Ops  site (https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/answers/detail/a_id/14066/p1,2/c/1075).  The  Operations CF  Team  (CFT)  implements  policy  established  by  the  Operations  Executive  Board  (OEB)  and engages  with  the  Ops  workforce  to  accomplish  career  management  objectives  for  over  7,000 civilians  working  in  operations.  Ops  CFT  team  members  (administrators)  come  from  the Ops community and are assigned to a three-year career broadening position at HQ AFPC. As one of twenty-two plus CFs located at AFPC, the Ops CFT is an important member of the AF's overall career management team. The team’s mission is to provide the framework to build and maintain a professional civilian workforce of AF operators that support the Ops and AF missions. 21.3.  CF  Governance  Structure.  The  Operations  Executive  Board  (OEB)  provides  oversight of  the  operations  community.  The  OEB  addresses  CF  management  initiatives  and  issues impacting  the  entire  Ops  CF  including,  but  not  limited  to:  workforce  requirements,  recruiting, force  renewal,  force  development  and  retention.  This  includes  ensuring  the  workforce  is  being developed in a manner to produce effective leaders through planned development activities, and ensuring career paths are clear and compatible with opportunities and the needs of the AF. The Ops  CFT  presents  workforce  issues  for  resolution  through  the  CFM  and  FM  as  required.

DT.  The  OEB  Chair  serves  as  the  DT  Chair  and  approves  members  of  the  civilian DT per table in para 21.3.2. General roles and responsibilities for the DT are defined in AFI 36-2640. The Ops DT is made up of an Intermediate DT and a Senior DT panel, with the DT Chair  presiding  over  both  teams.  The  Ops  CFP  does  not  cover  military  DTs  or  military operators. 21.4.  CF Unique Positions.  The Ops CFP has one unique developmental program at this time, the  PALACE  Acquire  (PAQ)  Program  that  is  governed  by  AFI  36-602.  The  Ops  CFT  is responsible  for  the  recruitment,  development  and  training  of  Ops  PAQ  interns  in  coordination with  MAJCOMs.  The  program  offers  recent  college  graduates  a  well-planned  three-year development and training program. Personnel should contact the Ops CFT PAQ administrator or the myPers website for program specifics. 21.5.  CF  Unique  Requirements.  Commanders/Civilian  Equivalents  will  ensure  that  any unique position requirements such as the requirement for a pilot certificate, air traffic controller certificate, etc., are addressed in the job’s Core Position Description or position coding. (T-3). 21.6.  Career  Paths  and  Career  Progression  Models.  Because  the  Ops  CF  is  comprised  of many  different  series,  career  paths  can  be  varied.  The  OEB  has  defined  Centrally  Managed positions  as  operational  and  strategic  level  positions  (GS-13  through  GS-15  grade  level). Centrally  Managed  positions  also  include  four  types  of  developmental  positions:  Career Broadening, Key Developmental (i.e. CSLP, DSLDP), Key Career Position, and PQA. Each of these positions provides developmental work experiences intended to prepare Ops team members for higher-level supervisory and managerial positions. Individuals advance through progressively more  complex  assignments,  which  may  include  career  broadening  assignments  in  other functional areas or rotational training assignments at the mid-management level. There are three Ops  levels  of  career  development  which  drive  the  OCFP:  Tactical,  Operational  and  Strategic. Each  developmental  level  identifies  suggested  competencies  and  the  path  an  AF  Ops  civilian should follow throughout their career. Figure 21.1. highlights a typical career progression in Ops. This  development  concept  grooms  Operations  civilians  for  strategic  level  senior  management positions  at  MAJCOM,  Joint  Command  and  HAF,  and  meets  CF  requirements  for  succession planning  and  leadership  development  internally.  The  end  result  should  be  Operations  leaders with broad and diverse experiences and expertise who are highly competitive for positions within the  Ops  community  and  throughout  the  AF.  Developmental  templates  are  used  to  assist  and guide  discussions  between  Ops  career  team  members  and  their  supervisors/managers  for suggested  career  paths and  plans  for  an  Ops  career  professional.

If a topic is not covered in this chapter, see Chapter 2. 22.2.  CF Mission.  The Office of the General Counsel enables the AF to accomplish its mission by  providing  actionable,  candid  and  independent  legal  advice  and  counsel,  effective  advocacy and  creative  problem  solving.  The  JAG  Corps’  mission  is  to  deliver  professional,  candid, independent counsel and full-spectrum legal capabilities to the commands and the warfighter. 22.3.  CF  Governance.  The  Legal  Civilian  CF  (CCF)  Functional  Advisory  Council  structure includes oversight of the legal community civilian workforce. This  oversight includes  ensuring individuals  are  identified  and  encouraged  to  continue  in  the  AF  Legal  CF,  developing  the workforce in a manner which produces effective leaders through planned development activities, and ensuring career paths are clear and compatible with opportunities and AF requirements. The Advisory Council (also known functionally as the Policy Council) provides oversight and policy direction  to  the  DTs  and  the  Chief,  CFT  in  matters  of  force  development,  CF  management initiatives and issues affecting the legal CF.

This chapter is limited to personnel assigned to CFID “6.” If a topic is not covered in ((https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/login/redirect/home) for additional information. the  myPers  website this or chapter, see  Chapter 2 23.2.  CF  Mission.  The  Medical  CF  Team  (MEDCFT)  plays  a  critical  role  in  developing civilians  to  support  current  and  projected  health  service  requirements.  Air  Force  Medical Services  (AFMS)  civilians  lead  and  manage  essential  medical  services  to  support  and  sustain essential  AF  mission  capabilities.  Medical  duties/specialties  have  an  integral  role  across  AF mission requirements, to include flight medicine, battlefield medicine (on the ground and in the air),  force  health  protection,  wellness  and  health  services  for  warfighters,  their  families  and retirees.  The  Medical  Civilian  CF  Program  (MCFP)  seeks  to  train,  develop  and  prepare  our civilian  corps  to  supervise,  lead  and  execute  healthcare  operations;  develop  and  integrate operational  strategies,  plans  and  concepts;  and  to  otherwise  fulfill  capability  requirements necessary to support National Military Strategy as prescribed by senior leadership. 23.3.  CF  Governance  Structure.  The  Medical  Civilian  Functional  Advisory  Council (MCFAC, shown in table 23.3.1.), provides developmental oversight of the medical workforce. The MCFAC membership is proposed by AF/SG1/8, FM, and adjudicated by the AF/SG FA. In coordination  with  the  FM  and  FA,  the  composition  may  be  adjusted  to  meet  the  mission dynamics.  The  MCFAC  addresses  force  development  issues  applicable  to  the  entire  CF.  This includes  ensuring  the  workforce  is  developed  in  a  manner  that  produces  medical  professionals and  effective  leaders  through  deliberate  development  activities  and  to  ensure  career  paths  are clear  and  compatible  with  opportunities  and  needs  of  the  AF.  The  MEDCFT  located  at  AFPC presents workforce issues for resolution through the CFM. AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   127  Table 23.1.  Medical Civilian Functional Advisory Council Composition.

DT.  The  FM  establishes  DTs  to  provide  and  execute  education,  training  and experience  vectors  to  foster  development  of  employees  in  the  medical  CF.  Roles  and responsibilities for DTs are defined in AFI 36-2640. 23.3.2.  Executive Panels. The MCFAC utilizes a Medical Civilian Advisory Panel (MCAP) to formulate various enhancement and development initiatives, identify concerns and provide   128  AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016 recommendations.  Senior  medical  personnel  from  across  the  AF,  with  support  from  the MEDCFT, may participate on the panels as requested by the CFM. 23.4.  CF Unique Positions.  The Medical CFT does not participate in PAQ or Pathways Intern program. 23.5.  CF  Unique  Requirements.  Multiple  occupations  in  the  medical  series  require  special licensure  and/or  board/other  certifications.  Refer  to  OPM  Qualifications  Standards  for  the specific occupational series and specialty for requirements. 23.6.  Career Paths and Career Progression Models. 23.6.1.  Leadership  Development.  As  career  members  progress  in  grade  and  responsibility, they become eligible to compete for Unit/MAJCOM/FOA/HQ opportunities as subject matter experts  and/or  as  supervisors  of  a  functional  area  of  expertise  or  administration.  While  all medical  positions  are  assigned  to  a  Corps  for  purposes  of  management  and  oversight, members may request  vectoring  for consideration for leadership roles that may be filled by an appropriately developed and eligible civilian member from any Corps. CF members may move from one occupational series to another, and possibly shift from one Corps oversight to another, when they are both eligible and selected for a position managed by another medical corps. 23.6.2.  Medical CF Pyramid. The development program ultimately grooms medical civilians to  operational  and  strategic  levels  for  upper  and  senior  management  positions  at  the  HAF, Major  Commands,  FOAs  and/or  DoD  level  positions.  The  career  development  program  is designed to meet CF requirements for succession planning and leadership development. The end  result  should  be  civilian  medics  prepared  with  broad  and  diverse  experiences  and expertise  and  thereby  highly  competitive  for  positions  within  the  medical  community.  A sample career pyramid, adjusted as dictated by FA or FM, follows at figure 23.1. AFMAN36-606  2 MAY 2016   129  Figure 23.1.  Medical Force Development Pyramid.    GABRIEL O.
