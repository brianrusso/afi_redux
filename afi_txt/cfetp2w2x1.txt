This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and  training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support  resources, and minimum core task requirements for the Nuclear Weapons specialty.  The CFETP  will provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career  field training.  NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty  position qualification training.  2.  The CFETP consists of two parts. Both parts of the plan will be used by supervisors to plan,  manage, and control training within the career field.  This plan will be used as the sole source of  initial training documentation.  Supervisors will maintain both Part I and II in the master training  plan.  Only Part II is required for individual training records; however, all personnel should be familiar with Part I.  2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A  explains how to use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other); Section D indicates  resource constraints. Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities; Section E  identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt.  2.2.  Part II includes the following:  Section A is the Course Objective List and Section B  identifies available support materials.  An example is Qualification Training Packages (QTPs),  which may be developed to support proficiency training.  Section C identifies the training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are  both mandatory and optional courses, correspondence course requirements and exportable  courses; Section D identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.  Section E contains  the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support  training, proficiency codes used to indicate training/information provided by Air Education and  Training Command (AETC), core tasks and the certification for On-the-Job Training (OJT) where supervisors determine if airmen satisfied training requirements.  3.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals within the Nuclear Weapons  specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career.  This plan  will enable training today’s workforce for tomorrow’s jobs.  At unit level, supervisors and  trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall  goals of this plan.  3  Abbreviations/Terms Explained  Advanced Training (AT).

Purpose.  The Nuclear Weapons CFETP provides information necessary for the 2W2X1  AFCFM, MFM's, commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop,  manage, and conduct an effective career field training program.  The plan outlines the training  that individuals in AFSC 2W2X1 must receive in order to develop and progress throughout their  career.  The plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency  training.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into  the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  For nuclear  weapons technicians, this training is conducted by AETC at the 363rd Training Squadron,  Sheppard AFB.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task/knowledge qualification  requirements, and correspondence course requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, 9-skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade  training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skill and knowledge required to do  the job. Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected airman.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or  OJT provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required  for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes, some are:  1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate the training program.  In addition, it helps supervisors identify training requirements so individuals receive training at  the appropriate point in their career.  1.2. specialty and identifies education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s  career.  1.3.  Lists training courses available, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method.  1.4. process.  2.  Uses.  The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive  and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.  2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, non-resident, field, and  exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will coordinate with the AFCFM and MFMs to develop acquisition strategies  for obtaining resources needed to provide training.  2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial,  upgrade, and proficiency requirements.  OJT, resident training, and contract training or  exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements.  MAJCOM-developed training to support  this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into the plan.  2.3.  Each individual must complete the mandatory training requirements (core tasks) specified in  this plan for skill level upgrade.  The Part II lists courses to support training.  3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority for the CFETP.  MAJCOM and AETC representatives will identify and coordinate on the career field training  requirements.  The AETC training manager for this specialty (363TRS/TRR, Sheppard AFB)  will initiate an annual review Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the career field-  training  7  of this document.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will  eliminate duplicate training.  Section B - Career Progression and Information:  1.  Specialty Description.  1.1.  Specialty Summary.

Enlisted Professional Military Education (EPME). 1.1. Basic EPME (Distance Learning). Air Force EPME is a time-in-service (TIS)-based model that ensures targeted delivery of institutional competencies (ICs) throughout the Continuum of Learning across an enlisted Airman’s career through distance learning. Basic EPME Requirements will be developed in three phases across an Airman’s career. Refer to AFI 36-2301, Developmental Education, for the most current guidance and TIS requirements. 1.1.1. Phase 1. Phase 1 is the resident Airman Leadership School (ALS), which meets all EPME requirements (basic and comprehensive). RegAF Airmen must complete and pass Phase 1 to be eligible to enroll in Phase 2 EPME. Air Reserve Component (ARC) Airmen may accomplish ALS via DL and/or via the resident or satellite program. 1.1.2. Phase 2. Phase 2 (Course 15) meets the basic requirements for NCOs. All RegAF and ARC Airmen must enroll within the TIS window. Failure to enroll, complete, and pass Phase 2 within one year of enrollment renders Airmen ineligible to reenlist and compete for promotion until this requirement is met. The ARC will determine the consequences for failure to complete required Phase 2 within established timeframes. 1.1.3. Phase 3. Phase 3 (Course 14, Version 6) meets the basic requirements for SNCOs. RegAF Airmen must complete and pass Phase 2 to be eligible to enroll in Phase 3. See promotion policy for guidance related to course completion and senior rater endorsement. 1.2. Comprehensive EPME (In-residence).  The comprehensive learning experience EPME are in-residence courses that builds upon the Basic EPME requirements to achieve higher proficiency levels and is delivered in three phases. Refer to AFI 36-2301, Developmental Education, for the most current guidance and TIS requirements. 1.2.1. Phase 1 EPME. The ALS resident program delivers both basic and comprehensive learning requirements. The ALS DL course is available for ARC Airmen and meets all basic requirements. 1.2.2. Phase 2 EPME NCOA Intermediate Learning Experience (ILE) is a resident opportunity that delivers comprehensive learning requirements.

Implementation.  This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC.  The  qualitative requirements proficiency code key will be used to determine the level of training and  knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses as indicated in column  4 of the STS.  2.1. Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, this STS:  2.1.1  Lists in column 1 the most common tasks, knowledge, and the technical references (TR)  necessary for airman to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level AFSC in the Nuclear  Weapons ladder of the Munitions and Weapons Maintenance Career Field.  These are based on  an analysis of the duties in this CFETP.   21  2.1.2.  Identifies in column 2 (by a 5 or a 7), specialty-wide minimum core task training requirements for award of 2W251 and 2W271 AFSCs.  2.1.3.  Provides in column 3, OJT certification columns to record completion of task and  knowledge training requirements.  Task certification must show a certification/completed date.  2.1.4.  Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements in column 4. Columns 4A  and 4C (1) show the level to which task/knowledge training has been accomplished by the AETC  Training Center for 2W231 and 2W271 courses respectively, as described at  https://etca.randolph.af.mil.  Column 4B (2) indicates the career knowledge provided in the 5-skill level CDC.  Column 4C (2) indicates the career knowledge provided in the 7-skill level  CDC.  Use of / in the Proficiency Level column denotes level of training that will be attained under  existing constraints. (Example: 2b/X [unfunded] or 2b/a [partially funded])  3.  Job Qualification Standard.  The STS becomes a JQS for OJT training when placed in  TBA, OJT Training Record. For OJT, the tasks/knowledge in column 1 are trained and qualified  to the “go/no go” level.  “Go” means the individual can perform the task without assistance and  meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures and possesses  the required knowledge as determined by the trainer.  When used as a JQS, the following  requirements apply:  3.1.  Documentation.  Document training IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.  3.2.  Upgrade Certification Procedures:  Prior to upgrade, all personnel, regardless of duty  position, must satisfactorily complete upgrade training requirements.  Trainees must also meet  AFSC experience requirements outlined in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD), this CFETP, task certified on all upgrade core tasks and have a minimum of 12   months performing nuclear weapon system maintenance tasks, as a certified team member or  team chief as outlined above.  Additionally, all 7-skill level trainees must complete the formal  2W271 course, the 7-level CDC (Completion of 7-level CDC’s is mandatory prior to attendance  of the in-residence 7-Level course) and work centers added local training requirements.  Completion of non-mandatory tasks pertinent to the unit mission will continue to be accomplished, as resources become available for training.    3.3.  When a CDC is not available, the supervisor will identify STS training references the  trainee requires for career knowledge and ensures, as a minimum, trainees cover the mandatory  items in the AFECD.  3.4.  For two-time CDC course exam failures, supervisors will recommend to unit training  managers the trainee be either eliminated from the AFSC or the AF, or recommend a waiver for  wing commander evaluation.  NOTE: Career Knowledge must be documented prior to  submitting a CDC waiver by identifying all STS items corresponding to the areas covered by the  CDC; have the trainee complete a study of STS references and undergo an evaluation by the certifier, and receives certification on the STS.  4.  Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  The STS is used as a guide for development of promotion tests used in WAPS.  Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) questions  are developed at the USAF Airman Advancement Division by 2W2 Senior NCOs with extensive  practical experience in the Nuclear Weapons Career Field judged by test development team  members to be the most appropriate knowledge areas for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based on the study references listed in the WAPS catalog.  5.  Recommendations.  Report unsatisfactory performance of individual apprentice course  graduates to AETC during telephone field interviews, through the customer service information  line (CSIL) at DSN 736-5236, or directly to the schoolhouse at DSN 736-0539.  All questions or change recommendations  22  regarding the CFETP will be routed through the  respective MAJCOM Functional Manager (MFM).
