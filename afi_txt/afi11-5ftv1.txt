Scope.  AFMC  produces  a  three-volume  set  of  Flight  Test  (FT)  instructions  containing attachments for each Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS) Group flown in AFMC.  These instructions are numbered AFI 11-5FT Volumes 1, 2, and 3, and contain the training, evaluation criteria,  and  operations  procedures,  respectively,  for  each  SUAS  Group.    AFMC  uses  these instructions in lieu of AFI 11-5GP Group-specific volumes for Research Developmental Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) flying operations.  The purpose of this instruction is to establish roles and responsibilities,  standardize  policy,  and  define  basic  processes  for  the  training  of  operators involved  with  SUAS  flight  RDT&E  activities.    The  intent  of  this  instruction  is  to  complement existing flight test approval processes and ensure AFMC and USAFA units effectively manage technical  and  safety  risks  during  the  conduct  of  SUAS  RDT&E  activities  by  properly  training and  certifying  SUAS  Operators.    In  this  instruction  the  term  “RDT&E  activities”  shall  include participation  of  AFMC  owned/possessed  SUAS  in  laboratory  tests,  experiments,  technology demonstrations,  or  war  gaming  exercises.    Note:  AFRL  is  the  lead  AFMC  organization  for SUAS  flight  research  and  test  activities.  USAFA  RDT&E  activities  follow  AFMC  lead command guidance. 1.2.  Unit Supplements.  The SUAS unit will supplement this instruction if required to include: 1.2.1.  Training for operators not specifically covered in this instruction. 1.2.2.  Ground  and  flying  training  requirements  needed  to  qualify  operators  for  the  unit's mission. 1.2.3.  Ground  and  flying  training  requirements  needed  for  conversion  and  difference training. 1.2.4.  Local Area Operating procedures. 1.2.5.  The unit may direct additional required training not covered in this instruction in order to  meet  any unit specific requirements.   The unit commander will publish any unit specific training  requirements  in  a  supplement  to  this  instruction.    All  original  and  any  permanent changes  to  the  content  of  the  supplement  must  be  coordinated  through  AFRL/DO  and approved  by  HQ  AFMC/A3V  using  the  AFMC  Form  73  process.    For  training  plans associated with unit supplements, changes will also be submitted through AFRL/DO to HQ AFMC/A3V using the AFMC Form 73 process or through MAJCOM approved software. 1.2.6.  Unit  supplements  will  be  coordinated  with  AFRL/DO  for  coordination/staffing  prior to  being  sent  to  HQ  AFMC/A3V,  508  W.  Choctawhatchee  Ave,  Suite  4,  Eglin  AFB,  FL 32542-5713,  or  emailed  to  AFRL/DO  Workflow  for  review  and  submission  to  HQ AFMC/A3V  for  approval  prior  to  publication.    Include  AFMC/A3V  on  the  distribution  list for approved supplements. 1.3.  Recommended Changes.  Send recommended changes on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to AFRL/DO for coordination/staffing prior to HQ AFMC/A3V, 508 W.  Choctawhatchee  Ave,  Suite  4,  Eglin  AFB,  FL  32542-5713  or  email  them  to  AFRL/DO AFI11-5FTV1  27 AUGUST 2015   5  Workflow for review and submission to HQ AFMC/A3V.  HAF/A3O is the approval authority for interim changes (IC) and revisions to this instruction. 1.4.  Waivers.  Unless  otherwise  specified  in  this  instruction,  HQ  AFMC/A3V  is  the  waiver authority for this instruction.  All waivers will be routed through appropriate training channels to unit commanders and coordinated with AFRL/DO prior to submission to HQ AFMC/A3V.  Use an AFMC Form 73, AFMC Flight Operations Waiver Request, to process the waiver. 1.4.1.  Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk. 1.4.1.1.  “Tier 0” (T-0) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance is determined and waived by respective non-Air Force authority. 1.4.1.2.  “Tier  1”  (T-1)  requirements  are  reserved  for  requirements  that  non-compliance may  put  airman,  mission,  or  program  strongly  at  risk,  and  may  only  be  waived  by  the MAJCOM/CC  or  delegate  with  concurrence  of  publication  approver.    When  multiple MAJCOMs are affected, then T-1 is appropriate. 1.4.1.3.  “Tier 2” (T-2) requirements are reserved for requirements that potentially put the mission at risk or potentially degrade the mission or program, and may only be waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate. 1.4.1.4.  “Tier  3”  (T-3)  requirements  are  reserved  for  requirements  that  non-compliance has  a  remote  risk  of  mission  failure,  and  may  be  waived  by  the  Wing/CC  but  no  lower than the OG/CC. 1.5.  Responsibilities. 1.5.1.  SUAS  flight  test  unit  commanders  and  AFRL  supervisors  at  all  levels  must  monitor the progress of operator training to ensure timely progression through the appropriate training phases and to identify areas in which an operator needs more training. 1.5.2.  The unit SUAS Training Manager/office will: (T-3) 1.5.2.1.  Develop and implement programs to carry out required operator training.  SUAS operator training in preparation for SUAS research activities will occur concurrently with program test planning and well enough in advance so that all required operators are fully qualified  and  certified  prior  to  the  Test  Approval  Authority  (TAA)  flight  authorization approval. 1.5.2.2.  Ensure all course prerequisites are completed before entering a crewmember into any phase of training. 1.5.2.3.  Track training progress (entry and training completion dates as a minimum) via a locally developed process. 1.5.2.4.  Maintain  operator  training  records  by  electronic  means  using  MAJCOM approved training software or, if no such means available, by using paper copies for all assigned/attached  operators.    As  a  minimum,  conduct  end  of  half  reviews  of  active training records. 1.5.2.5.  Maintain an Operator Letter of Certification (Letter of Xs or LOX) by electronic means  using  MAJCOM  approved  training  software  or,  if  no  such  means  available,  by using paper copies.  This letter documents all operator mission certifications.  The Letter   6  AFI11-5FTV1  27 AUGUST 2015 of  Xs  must  be  updated  monthly  and  certified  by  the  unit  commander,  or  operations officer.  The Letter of Xs in conjunction with the AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Aircrew Training, and AFMC Form 68, Flight Training Record, signed at the conclusion of training serve to  document each operator’s certifications.  For those qualifications or events  that  only  require  a  Form  67,  Ground  Training  Record  (e.g.  Evaluator  Training) and  do  not  require  an  AFMC  Form  68  as  part  of  training,  also  document  completed training on the AF Form 1381. 1.5.2.5.1.  The  Letter  of  Xs  must  be  updated  and  made  available  upon  request  to AFRL/DO and/or AFMC/A3V at the end of each semi-annual training cycle. 1.5.2.6.  Ensure  no  SUAS  test  activity  is  conducted  unless  operators  are  trained  and certified  in  appropriate  systems  and  mission  events  as  applicable,  and  proper documentation  is  provided  to  AFRL/DO  training  section.    All  SUAS  test  flight  activity must  be  correlated  to  an  approved  test  plan  and  within  its  scope,  guidance,  restrictions, and safety planning. 1.6.  Accepting  Previous  Qualification.  Unit  commanders  may  accept  an  operator's  basic SUAS  qualification,  mission,  and  upgrade  training  from  other  AFMC  units  or  non-AFMC sources  such  as  other  MAJCOM  units,  contractor  units,  or  external  industry  partners.  Acceptance will be predicated on applicable validation such as the AF Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew  Qualification,  AF  Form  1381,  USAF  Certification  of  Aircrew  Training,  or  other appropriate documentation presenting  evidence  of specific SUAS Operator (SUAS-O) training, certification,  and  experience.  Use  the  AF  Form  4348  to  document  rated/formal  MDS qualification  certification,  such  as  accepting  a  Form  8  qualification.    Document  all  accepted qualifications,  other  than  rated/formal  MDS  qualifications,  on  AF  Form  1381.    Annotate acceptance by either 1) annotating “Previous Qual” above the date (if known) in the date block for  qualifications  accepted  or  2)  annotating  “(Accepted)”  next  to  the  accepted  qualification.    If another unit's qualification training is accepted, the unit commander will ensure AFMC-specific training  items  are  covered  in  adequate  detail.    IAW  AFI  11-502  Volume  1,  para  1.5.7.5.,  in-processing  must  include  completion  of  at  least  one  SUAS  local  familiarization  flight  (LAO training normally accomplishes this) under the supervision of a SUAS-Instructor (SUAS-I).   If additional  training  is  required,  document  additional  requirements  via  Memo  for  Record  in  the individual’s SUAS-O’s training folder.  Units may require at their discretion a flight or ground station evaluation by a SUAS-Evaluator (SUAS-E). identified  for 1.6.1.  Proficiency (Grandfathered) Qualifications.  Where a new SUAS training qualification documentation  requirement  becomes tasks  already  being  performed, appropriately experienced SUAS-Os may be documented as “Proficiency Qual” and qualified for those tasks prior to the appropriate standardized training AFMC Forms 67 and 68 for that task being developed.  SUAS-Os must accomplish the appropriate AFMC Forms 67 and 68 for  that  task  (once  developed)  and  maintain  them  in  their  training  records.    The  word “Proficiency  Qual”  will  be  annotated  in  AFMC  Form  68  block  8,  Flight  Evaluation Completion  Date,  for  those  members  deemed  qualified  based  on  tasks  already  being performed.  The unit Director of Operations (SUAS Lead) will be the approval authority for all proficiency qualifications. 1.6.2.  Inter-fly.    Inter-fly  is  the  exchange  and/or  substitution  of  SUAS  operator  members and/or  aircraft  system  between  commands  or  other  organizations  outside  of  AFMC.  AFI11-5FTV1  27 AUGUST 2015   7  Normally,  inter-fly  will  be  limited  to  specific  test  programs  but  may  include  basic  flight currency  as  determined  by  the  unit  Director  of  Operations  (SUAS  Lead).    As  a  minimum, operators will be already qualified or be provided difference/conversion training in the SUAS design  and  series,  as  well  as  systems  or  configurations  required  to  fly  the  aircraft  and/or mission.  AFRL/DO may authorize inter-fly agreements by mutual agreement with the other participating unit.  A formal inter-fly agreement is not required for intra-AFMC evaluators to perform evaluations, or members that occasionally act as “guest help” where AFRL/DO and the operating unit has accepted the credentials of the guest SUAS operator through the flight test safety review process and “Guest” status is reflected on the Letter of Xs.  Any training, qualifications, or certifications provided by the guest unit must reflect in the individual’s host unit  master  training  folder  and  LOX.    Inter-fly  involving  the  transfer  of  aircraft  between MAJCOMs must be coordinated and approved through HQ AFMC/A3O.  (T-2) 1.6.3.  GFRs  will  approve  contractor  SUAS  operator  qualifications  and  training  in accordance  with  DCMA  INST  8210.1,  applying  sound  judgment  to  meet  the  intent  of  the policies where not well-defined for SUAS operations.  (T-3) 1.7.  Training Guidelines. 1.7.1.  SUAS research or flight test units may conduct operator Phase I initial qualification, requalification, conversion, or difference training and Phase II mission qualification training concurrently.    This  training  will  be  IAW  AFI  11-502  Volume  1  and  CJCSI  3255.01,  Joint Unmanned Aircraft Systems Minimum Training Standards, requirements.  (T-2) 1.7.2.  Definitions. 1.7.2.1.  SUAS  have  been  defined  by  HQ  USAF/A3  as  the  class  of  UAS  smaller  than MQ-1 Predator (less than 1320 lbs).  SUAS are classified into 3  Groups as described in AFI 11-502 Volume 3, Attachment 5, Figure A5.1, “DoD UAS Categories/Groups.” 1.7.2.2.  AFI 11-502 Volume 3 requires designation of a Lead SUAS-O having ultimate authority as to the operation of the aircraft, equivalent to the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) of a manned aircraft.  SUAS-Os act a Lead SUAS-O (PIC-equivalent) of a SUAS when they are  the  primary  controller,  and  Lead  SUAS-O  responsibilities  normally  transfer  with  a handoff,  unless  briefed  otherwise.    See  AFI  11-5FT  Volume  3  for  further  requirements applicable to Lead SUAS-Os (11-202 PIC equivalents). 1.7.2.3.  SUAS  Operators  (SUAS-O)  are  defined  in  AFI  11-502  Volume  3  (para  1.3)  as individuals  qualified  and  responsible  for  the  safe  ground  and  flight  operations  of  the unmanned  aircraft  and  onboard  systems.    SUAS-Os  launch  and  land  the  aircraft  via laptop, radio control (R/C), or through an autonomous interface. The aircraft can also be controlled  during  the  mission  section  through  the  same  control  interface.  When referencing SUAS-Os, standard terminology will be used to avoid confusion and ensure interoperability with  legacy unmanned platforms. SUAS operators will use the standard terminology  (i.e.  LRE  and  MCE  pilot/sensor)  of  the  larger  Group  4/5  UAS/RPA Categories  to  the  max  extent  possible.  SUAS  Operators  are  classified  as  an  External Operator (EO) and/or Internal Operator (IO), which correlates to LRE and MCE aircrew. 1.7.2.3.1.  SUAS-O qualifications shall state the SUAS Group qualification first, then the  Aircraft  Type  Category  (Fixed  Wing,  Rotary,  Powered  Lift),  then  qualification (External, Internal), then Airframe name, followed by Control interface (Laptop, R/C,   8  AFI11-5FTV1  27 AUGUST 2015 Autonomous) and Autopilot (if equipped); for example, “GP1/FW/Internal Pilot/RQ-11/Laptop/Kestrel™ autopilot”. 1.7.2.3.1.1.  SUAS  External  Operator.  Qualifications  for  SUAS  External Operators are airframe-centric, with primary focus on skills involving direct real-time  aircraft  control  through  a  handheld  (RC-type/joystick)  controller.    The primary pilot skill is in controlling the aircraft’s flight controls through controller-hand-eye coordination.  The Family of Systems  for SUAS External  Operators is defined by the SUAS Group, Aircraft Type Category (fixed wing, rotary, powered lift),  and  Control  interface  (aircraft  interface).    Basic  familiarity  with  onboard autopilot systems and modes (if installed) is required for Internal Operator (GSO) manipulation  of  the  autopilot  during  mission  legs.  This  interaction  does  not constitute  primary  piloting  skills  (i.e.  does  not  require  proficiency/training  as SUAS  External  Operator).    Operations  using  tethered  handheld  R/C-type controllers  through  a  ground  station  link  (as  opposed  to  a  direct  R/C  link)  also require a qualified SUAS External Operator. 1.7.2.3.1.2.  SUAS  Internal  Operator.  Qualifications  for  Internal  Operators  are autopilot-centric, with primary focus on skills involving operating a computer or laptop running the ground station’s autopilot interface software and displays, such as  waypoint  navigation,  user  menus,  normal  and  contingency  programming,  and autopilot-override (“override mode”) inputs.  The primary IO skill is in operating the  aircraft  through  commanding  the  autopilot  from  the  ground  station.    The Family  of  Systems  for  SUAS-O  pilots  is  defined  by  the  SUAS  Group,  Aircraft Type  Category  (fixed  wing,  rotary,  powered  lift),  and  Control  interface  (aircraft interface).  Basic familiarity  with  airframe performance and control techniques is also  necessary,  although  this  is  secondary  to  primary  IO  skills.    Operating  the aircraft  through  direct  real-time  control  is  not  the  primary  IO  skill.    Typically, SUAS autopilot override (“override mode”) control is available as a backup, but not of sufficient fidelity nor used for fine or critical control tasks such as normal takeoff  and  landing.    In  these  cases,  either  autonomous  autopilot  control  or handoff  with  a  SUAS  External  Pilot  shall  be  used  to  perform  these  tasks.  Advanced  SUAS  ground  stations,  such  as  hybrids  with  a  cockpit-type  layout  or joystick  controller,  and  those  suitable  for  high-fidelity  autopilot  override/direct commands  to  the  flight  controls,  enabling  takeoff  and  landing,  require  SUAS External Pilot qualification to perform those tasks. 1.7.2.3.2.  Although  SUAS-Os  may  be  both  Internal  and  External  qualified  on  a particular  system,  SUAS-Os  shall  not  serve  in  both  positions  simultaneously  in systems requiring handoffs, unless specifically authorized as part of an approved test plan.    SUAS-Os  shall  not  serve  as  Lead  SUAS-O  (Pilot-In-Command-equivalent) for/or in direct control of two or more UAVs simultaneously, unless approved to do so by the waiver authority for this instruction. 1.7.2.3.3.  Payload Operators (PO) operate whatever payload is carried by the aircraft, if applicable, (datalinks, sensors, navigation systems, etc.) and typically have neither authority nor direct control over the aircraft’s trajectory, propulsion, or flight controls.  POs  must  operate  under  the  authority  and  supervision  of  a  separate  Lead  SUAS-O AFI11-5FTV1  27 AUGUST 2015   9  (11-202  PIC  equivalent).    At  a  minimum,  payload  operators  will  be  qualified  to operate all aircraft and mission systems under their control. 1.7.2.4.  SUAS Classifications.  See Table 1.1 for SUAS Classifications.  See section 2.3 for  requirements  regarding  training  and  qualification  requirements  relating  to  different SUAS classifications. 1.7.2.5.  SUAS  Groups.  When  determining  which  SUAS  Group  to  place  a  particular vehicle  in,  use  the  DoD  UAS  Groups  matrix  (AFI  11-502  Volume  3,  Attachment  5, Figure A5.1) as defined by maximum weight, speed, and altitude.  The DoD criteria yield insight  into  air  vehicle  kinetic  energy  levels  and  consideration  for  resultant  mishap damage effects.  Training Managers must specify on the Letter of Xs which DoD Group each UAV in their inventory belongs to. Note that the word “Categories” appears in the matrix but all AFI 11-502 or 11-5FT guidance uses the “Group” designations.  For those SUAS  that  can  operate  in  multiple  Groups,  the  normal  operating  weight,  altitude,  and speed will be used to determine the primary SUAS Group. 1.7.2.6.  SUAS  Type  Category/Family  of  Systems  (FOS).    This  section  outlines  the different type categories and classes of a variety of current SUASs, mirroring the classic FAA  usage.    The  major  drivers  for  these  distinctions  are  training  and  technique differences  in  lift/drag  and  thrust  operating  principles  for  control  of  the  vehicle.    These very  different  kinds  of  aircraft  require  different,  and  sometimes  conflicting,  operator techniques, training, and habit patterns.  Although the vast majority of AFMC SUAS are Fixed-Wing,  the  remaining  types  are  not  beyond  potential  use,  and  similar  training distinctions  and  considerations  must  be  taken  into  account  for  SUAS  operators  and qualifications.    For  AFMC  operations,  multiple  qualification  and  difference  training  is addressed in the AFMC Supplement to 11-502 Vol 2 paragraph 5.2.16. Table 1.1.

Training  folders  are  required  for  all  SUAS  operators  authorized  to  perform  SUAS flight duties or entered into any phase of training.  The training folder is used to organize and track training and to document completed training and may contain multiple SUAS platform specific training documentation.  SUAS Operators/Training Managers  will maintain training folders  electronically  if  possible  or  manually  in  paper  format.    Electronic  signatures  on training forms  are authorized. Construct and maintain folders IAW  paragraph 1.8.4.  Avoid using  PII  unless  necessary.  For  example,  it  is  allowable  to  use  the  last  four  of  the  SSN instead of the full number. 1.8.2.  Access  to  electronic  training  folders  will  be  restricted  to  authorized  personnel  via  a password or other means. Active training folders will be readily accessible to instructors and trainers,  supervisory  personnel,  and  the  individual  operators  in  training.    Instructors  and trainees  will  review  training  folders  for  each  specific  training  session  and  complete  the necessary forms in a timely manner. 1.8.3.  The  individual  is  primarily  responsible  for  accomplishing  required  training  and maintaining  currencies.    The  training  manager  is  responsible  for  supervising  and  reviewing each training folder for accuracy and required training as well as tracking aircrew currencies.  Certifications  are  maintained  by  the  local  unit  via  the  Letter  of  Xs,  with  monthly  updated copies  provided  to  the  AFRL/DO  training  office,  SUAS-I/Training  Manager.    If  the individual  changes  units,  the  individual  and/or  unit  Lead  SUAS-I/Training  Manager  will ensure the training folder (in electronic or paper format) and certifications are forwarded to the gaining unit. 1.8.4.  Organize training folders as follows: 1.8.4.1.  Place a label with the trainee's name, grade, SUAS, and operator position on the folder, if in paper form.  Multiple systems can be listed or “Multiple SUAS Operations” can  be  used.    Maintain  a  current  AF  Form  1381  (on  the  inside  cover  if  in  paper  form).  Annotate  all  completed  Phase  I/initial  qualification  training  (IQT)  and  Phase  II/mission qualification  training  (MQT)  and  acceptance  of  non-AFMC/previous  qualifications  if applicable. 1.8.4.2.  Divide  the  folder  into  separate  sections  as  described  below.  File  completed training sessions as a set (applicable AFMC Forms 67, 68, and 69) with the most recent set on top.  The set will be ordered with the AFMC Form 67 on top, the AFMC Form 68 in the middle, and the AFMC Forms 69 last. AFI11-5FTV1  27 AUGUST 2015   11  1.8.4.3.  Section  One  will  contain  ground  and  flying  training  documentation  for  Phase I/IQT.    Section  Two  will  contain  ground  and  flying  training  documentation  for  Phase II/MQT.    Section  Three  will  contain  ground  and  flying  training  upgrade  documentation for  instructor  and/or  flight  examiner  upgrade  training.    Section  Four  will  contain  any other commander approvals/authorization, letters certifying previous qualifications, waiver approvals, email coordination, mission and/or upgrade qualifications, memorandums for record, and flight evaluation records if no Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) is separately maintained.  AFMC does not require separate FEFs for SUAS. correspondence training to include training letters, 1.8.5.  Entry into Training. Prior to  beginning externally (non-AFMC) provided training, or each Phase I or Phase II qualification, the flying unit commander or operations officer (unit SUAS Lead) must authorize the training.  The training may be authorized on a signed Letter of Xs or with an Entry into Training letter maintained in Section Four of the training folder. Use the AF Form 80, IAW AFI 11-502 Volume 2, to document above-unit approval for entry into training for SUAS-Os seeking to  gain  and maintain SUAS multiple qualifications.  Do not  enter  SUAS-O  personnel  into  more  than  one  training  program  at  the  same  time.    In  all cases  the  training  office  must  track  training  start  and  completion  due  dates.    Trainees  and Operators  must  complete  all  required  ground  and  flight  training  required  for  the  specific SUAS intended for operation.   If the trainee is unable to complete any aspect of Phase I or Phase  II  during  the  course,  a  training  deficiency  letter  will  be  forwarded  to  the  trainee’s supervisor  and  a  determination  made  on  whether  to  correct  the  deficiency  or  remove  the individual from the training program. 1.8.6.  Training Forms: 1.8.6.1.  HQ  AFMC/A3V  approved  SUAS  training  forms  used  to  document  all  AFMC SUAS aircrew training are provided in electronic format by AFRL/DO. AFMC/A3V will approve  all  SUAS  training  forms.    These  AFMC/A3V-approved  forms  are  the  only authorized training forms.  EXCEPTION: If the training plan form/syllabus for a unique mission  is  not  available,  units  may  develop  a  unique  training  plan  for  AFRL/DO concurrence  and  AFMC/A3V  approval.    After  approval  the  unit-specific  plan  must  be referenced  in  a  unit  supplement  to  this  instruction,  or  may  be  maintained  locally  after approval  by  HQ  AFMC/A3V.    Units  will  maintain  electronic  training  forms  using MAJCOM approved software, if possible.  (T-2) 1.8.6.2.  Training  Form  Usage.  To  ensure  the  most  current  syllabus  is  used,  Training Managers and SUAS-Is will only download the forms when Phase I or Phase II training is initiated as training forms frequently change and previous editions of training forms are obsolete. 1.8.6.3.  Training Form Update Cycle. AFRL will always have the most current edition of all  forms.    AFMC/A3V  will  approve  all  training  forms.  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  training forms will be updated each year. 1.8.6.4.  The  AF  Form  1381,  Certification  of  SUAS  Operator  Training,  is  used  to document and certify all individuals’ certifications and qualifications, and is the official source of what is reflected on the Letter of Xs.  Completion of training and certification will  be  documented  on  the  AF  Form  1381  or  suitable  computer  product,  maintained inside  the  front  cover  of  the  individual’s  training  folder,  and  copies  forwarded  to   12  AFI11-5FTV1  27 AUGUST 2015 AFRL/DO to support qualifications shown on the Letter of Xs.  The AF Form 1381 must be signed by the SUAS-O’s TD Director or designated official such as the Lead SUAS-I/Training Manager (electronic “signatures” are permitted). 1.8.6.5.  The  AFMC  Form  67,  Ground  Training  Record,  is  used  to  record  all  ground training required before the trainee's first flight.  This form provides for the overprint of required  ground  training  tasks.    Any  additional  ground  training  (simulators,  cockpit procedural  trainers,  etc.)  accomplished  during  the  flying  training  phase  will  be documented  on  the  AFMC  Form  69.    Table  1.2  provides  detailed  instructions  for completing the AFMC Form 67. Table 1.2.  Instructions for completing AFMC Form 67, Ground Training Record.

(i.e.,  BAT3 External Operator training.) The  left  column  will  list  the  tasks  and  subtasks  requiring specific trainee knowledge.  In the right  columns, the instructor conducting the training will print his name and the date that the specific training event was completed.    The  trainee  will  sign  and  date  when  the  last  training  item  is completed. The instructor completing the last required training item on the form will sign and date.  The instructor’s signature certifies that all the required ground training events have been accomplished. Record  any  pertinent  comments  or  direction  regarding  specific training. 1.8.6.6.  The  AFMC  Form  68,  Flying  Training  Record,  is  used  to  record  all  flying training.    This  form  provides  for  the  overprint  of  required  training  tasks  and  end-of-course proficiency levels for each ground/flying training task.  It also records the number of  events  accomplished  and  proficiency  level  attained  by  the  trainee.    AFMC  Form  68 lesson  plans  establish  the  minimum  required  training  events  to  be  completed  for  initial qualification  (QUAL),  requalification  (REQUAL),  and  instructor  upgrade  (INST).    The AFMC  Form  68  is  the  official  certifying  document  for  any  locally-conducted  Phase  I qualification,  and  each  Phase  II  qualification.    Table  1.3.  provides  detailed  instructions for completing the AFMC Form 68. 1.8.6.6.1.  Grading and Grade Definitions. Each AFMC syllabus training event must be  graded.    Unless  noted  otherwise  (with  a  “D”  in  the  events  required  column)  all training events on the AFMC Form 68 must be accomplished until Proficiency, “P”, is  achieved.  The AFMC Form  68 indicates the  required events  and  grades for each training  event.  A  grade  of  “P”,  Proficient,  “T”,  Training  Required,  or  “D”, AFI11-5FTV1  27 AUGUST 2015   13  Demonstration/Discussion  will  be  given  at  the  instructor’s  discretion  using  the following definitions: 1.8.6.6.1.1.  (P)  Proficient.    The  student  demonstrated  the  knowledge  and  skill necessary to successfully complete the event without instructor intervention and, in  the  instructor’s  opinion,  will  be  able  to  repeat  the  event  successfully  in  the future. 1.8.6.6.1.2.  (T)  Training  Required.    The  student  did  not  demonstrate  the knowledge  and  skill  necessary  to  successfully  complete  the  event.  The  student must continue training in that event until a grade of “P” is achieved. 1.8.6.6.1.3.  (D)  Demonstration.    The  event  was  discussed/demonstrated  inflight by the instructor, and either 1) was not  yet attempted by the trainee for a “T” or “P”  grade  (if  required),  or  2)  requires  only  instructor  discussion  and/or demonstration , and a “P” or “T” grade is not nor will be assigned for the event.

All listed events require a proficiency level “P” or must be identified with a “D”.  Break the tasks out by general  areas topics,  ground  operations, emergency procedures, etc.).  The right six columns (excluding the far  right,  total  events)  correspond  to  the  sorties  accomplished. Record the  number  of  events accomplished  and  proficiency  level  attained  (#/P,  #/T,  or  #/D) during the sortie.  The trainee must attain a proficiency level of "P" on  the  accomplishment  of  the  last  event;  otherwise  he  or  she remains  in  a  training  status  until  proficiency  is  attained.    If  two lesson  plans  are  conducted  concurrently,  i.e.,  requalification training and instructor upgrade, and similar events are required on both; listed  will  be accomplished.

If  the  student  demonstrates  proficiency  in  at least  75  percent  of  the  minimum  required  events,  the  instructor,  with  certifying official  concurrence,  may  proficiency  advance  that  item.    For  example:  if  the minimum number of required takeoffs was 4 and the student is proficient for at least three  takeoffs,  then  the  instructor  may  recommend  advancing  that  training  item.  Comments  and  justification  on  the  associated  AFMC  Form  69  will  describe  which items  were  advanced.  The  Certifying  Official  signature  in  Block  9  serves  as concurrence  for  proficiency  advancement.    If  training  is  complete,  the  number  of required  sorties  may  also  be  reduced  using  these  same  guidelines.    If  the  student reaches proficiency and then regresses, proficiency must be regained before training is complete. 1.8.6.6.3.  Training  events  listed  may  be  completed  in  any  order;  however,  student progression will be based on level of performance.  At first, training will be designed to  familiarize  the  student  with  the  normal  operation  and  flight  characteristics  of  the SUAS.  The  student  will  then  advance  to  the  more  challenging  system  operations.  The  instructor  will  be  responsible  for  constructing  a  profile  for  each  training  flight based  on  the  student's  proficiency  and  the  minimum  number  of  events  to  be completed. 1.8.6.7.  The  AFMC  Form  69,  Flying  Training  Comments,  is  used  to  document  flying training.    This  form  is  used  in  conjunction  with  AFMC  Form  68,  or  can  be  used independently  to  document  training  (e.g.  recurrency  training).  It  provides  for  narrative descriptions  of  the  trainee's  progress  and  a  means  for  documenting  the  training  office review. Maintain  with  AFMC Form  68 in  the  appropriate section of the training folder.  A separate AFMC Form 69 will accompany each type of SUAS flight training received AFI11-5FTV1  27 AUGUST 2015   15  (i.e.  each  AFMC  Form  68).  The  instructor  will  document  any  significant  problems  the student has in completing a training event in enough detail so that subsequent instructors can provide appropriate training. Table 1.4 provides detailed instructions for completing the AFMC Form 69. Table 1.4.  Instructions for Completing AFMC Form 69, SUAS Flying Training Comments.

STRENGTH:  Comments  will elaborate on trainee’s strengths  and indicate  student  progress.  AREAS  FOR IMPROVEMENT:  Describe  the  trainee’s  weaknesses,  identify  problem  areas,  and areas record  unusual circumstances.  RECOMMENDATIONS:  Recommendations  will include  tasks  requiring  further  training  and  the  type  of  training required. If more space is needed, use the next blank section. Upon completion  of  all  training  requirements,  a  statement  such  as “Recommended  for  evaluation”  or  “All  training  requirements  for night operations completed” are appropriate.  However, a statement such as “cleared for night operations mission” is not appropriate as only  the  designated  government  flight  evaluator  or  Certifying Official may certify an individual for operations. Instructor will sign at completion of sortie.    Trainee will sign and date at completion of sortie.    The individual in the trainee’s chain of command, or designee, will review the comments before the next training sortie. He or she will highlight  any  comments  that  are  pertinent  to  follow-on  training.  Annotate  this  review  by  initials  of  person  conducting  review  and date  of  review.

This section outlines training needed to qualify a SUAS Operator for duties in an assigned position for a specific unmanned aircraft system.  AFMC Initial Qualification Training (IQT), requalification, conversion/difference, or instructor duty training. called  Phase training, also can I include training for 2.1.1.  Before  entering  qualification  training,  each  member  must  have  unit  commander’s approval.    Unit  commanders  may  authorize  a  SUAS  Operator  to  be  qualified  in  multiple SUAS  vehicles  if  mission  needs  dictate  (IAW  11-502  Vol  2,  Paragraph  5.2.16).  Appropriate documentation must be maintained in the individual’s training folder as dictated in section 1.8 of this instruction. 2.1.2.  All AFMC SUAS Phase I/IQT training plans (Forms 67 and 68) will be managed by AFRL/DO.   AFMC/A3V will approve all training plans.  The training  plans maintained by AFRL/DO  are  the  only  ones  authorized  to  execute  locally-conducted  Phase  I/IQT  training. EXCEPTION:  Unit-specific training forms may be maintained locally after approval by HQ AFMC/A3V.    To  ensure  use  of  the  most  current  training  plans,  training  instructors  will download the current training forms and materials just prior to starting each IQT session.  (T-2) 2.1.3.  Trainees  must  complete  all  academic  and  demonstration  requirements  as  directed  in the applicable courseware and satisfy all criteria set forth by the training plans and instructor.  For research or test programs utilizing systems with an existing Formal Training Unit course, training  officers  must  use  the  MAJCOM-approved  training  plans  and  courseware  for  the specific SUAS.  If there is no approved training plan, units will submit a proposed training plan  though  the  chain  of  command  to  AFMC/A3V  for  approval.  Section  1.8  of  this instruction  provides  instruction  for  using  the  required  AFMC  ground  and  flight  training forms. 2.1.4.  Flying training lessons will be completed in  order, if practical.   However, if mission scheduling or student progress dictates otherwise, the unit commander or designated training supervisor  may  change  the  order.    There  will  be  a  minimum  time  lapse  between  training missions and every effort will be made to complete qualification training requirements within the  prescribed  time  period.    All  applicable  IQT  requirements  for  a  specific  SUAS  must  be completed prior to commencement of MQT for the same SUAS, unless concurrent Phase I/II training is approved by AFMC/A3V. 2.2.  Instructor Requirements.  For qualification flight training in all SUAS, the instructor must be in a position to take immediate positive control of the aircraft. This requirement could be met through another set of controls (i.e. buddy box) or close enough to take over using the student’s controls.    The  SUAS  instructor  will  be  the  primary  safety  observer  any  time  a  trainee  is controlling the SUAS during IQT.  The SUAS-I will be physically located with the trainee and will be able to assume direct control of the SUAS if required.  (T-3) 2.3.  Conversion/Difference  Training.  Conversion typically  required  when dissimilarities within (or between) series of the same mission designation aircraft are significant training is AFI11-5FTV1  27 AUGUST 2015   17  enough to warrant more in-depth training, usually including flight training. Within the scope of AFMC  SUAS  operations,  conversion  training  applies  when  transitioning  to  a  different  SUAS Group or SUAS Control interface (IAW multiple qualification described in 11-502 Vol 2 AFMC Supplement  para  5.2.16).    Conversion  training  requires  completion  of  an  in-depth  Phase  I/IQT program  (or  a  formal  school  initial  qualification  course,  if  one  exists  for  that  particular  SUAS type).    Trainees  placed  in  IQT  are  in  Unqualified  status  for  that  system,  and  at  completion  of training  receive  either  Basic  or  Mission  qualification.    Formal  IQT  courses  also  typically culminate  with  an  evaluation  by  a  SUAS-E;  although  in  AFMC,  an  evaluation  is  not  normally required  for  additional  Conversion  certifications  within  the  same  SUAS  Group.  Conversion training  across  different  SUAS  Groups  or  Control  interface  is  considered  a  new  qualification requiring a Form 8/8a QUAL evaluation.  If gaining and maintaining qualification across two or more  SUAS  Groups  or  Control  interface,  the  SUAS-O  will  be  considered  Multiple  Qualified IAW  AFI  11-502  Volume  2  para  5.2.16,  requiring  approval  on  the  AFMC  Form  80  prior  to entering  training.    Conversion  training  will  usually  require  open/closed  book  testing.  Unit Commanders will determine if open/closed book testing is not required.  (T-3) 2.3.1.  Difference training is typically required when transitioning within (or between) series of the same mission/design aircraft. Within the scope of AFMC SUAS operations, difference training  applies  when  transitioning  to  another  aircraft  in  the  same  SUAS  Group  or  using  a different  Autopilot  without  changing  the  Control  interface.    Difference  training  may  be accomplished with a Phase II/MQT training plan conducted by a qualified SUAS-I, with no regression to  Unqualified, and no SUAS-E evaluation.    If no qualified SUAS-I/E or formal school  exists  to  provide  conversion  or  difference  training,  the  unit  training  office  will develop,  and  coordinate,  with  the  Lead  SUAS-I/Training  Managers,  training  programs  that maximize  use  of  highly  experienced  personnel  as  the  initial  cadre  to  self-instruct  and  build experience. 2.3.2.  Notwithstanding  the  guidance  in  2.3  above,  the  varying  configurations  of  SUAS platforms  may  make  it  difficult  to  always  provide  precise  criteria  for  conversion/difference training for all types. If differences between aircraft are great enough such that the individual needs more than cursory training in basic operation skills, the unit commander will determine if  conversion  training  requiring  completion  of  a  Phase  I/IQT  program  is  required.  Upon review  and  concurrence  from  AFRL/DO,  the  unit  commander  may  factor  in  non-DOD professional  or  recreational  SUAS  experience.  Use  the  AF  Form  4348,  IAW  AFI  11-502 Volume  2,  to  document  completion  of  conversion/difference  training  when  a  Form  8/8a evaluation  is  not  required.    In  addition,  for  each  individual  on  the  Letter  of  Xs,  units  will document all Form 8/8a qualifications, and Form 4348 and other certifications on a single AF Form 1381 and continuation sheet, if necessary.   18  AFI11-5FTV1  27 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 3 PHASE II - MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING 3.1.  General.  Use this instruction when completing mission qualification training (MQT), also called  Phase  II  training,  in  AFMC.    Units  will  establish  mission  ground  and  flying  training requirements for those aircraft, missions, and crewmembers (to include mission and operational support crew) not addressed in this instruction. Upon HQ AFMC/A3V approval, document this training in unit supplements.  Forms 67 and 68 may be published in unit supplements and/or unit maintained  websites.  Simulator  requirements,  based  on  availability  and  applicability,  will  be included  in  the  unit  developed  programs.    Use  AFMC  Forms  67/68/69  to  document  simulator training.    When  structuring  programs,  flying  units  will  ensure  that  mission  operational  and training areas are compatible. 3.1.1.  All AFMC SUAS Phase II/MQT training plans (Forms 67 and 68) will be managed by AFRL/DO.    AFMC/A3V  will  approve  all  training  plans.  The  training  plans  maintained  by AFRL/DO are the only  ones authorized to  execute Phase  II/MQT missions.  EXCEPTION:  Unit-specific  Phase  II  training  forms  may  be  maintained  locally  after  approval  by  HQ AFMC/A3V.  To ensure use of the most current  training plans, the training instructors will download  the  current  training  form  just  prior  to  starting  training  for  each  Phase  II  mission qualification.  (T-3) 3.1.2.  Phase II mission event qualification is lost upon loss of event currency exceeding six months.

The duration of the unqualified time is from the date the SUAS-O became unqualified until the specific retraining start date. 3.2.  Customized  MQT.  Programs  are  allowed  to  tailor  their  MQT  plans  to  individual operators.  This  is  based  on  the  individual’s  current  qualification,  experience,  currency, documented  performance,  available  training  assets,  and  formal  training.  Applicable  portions  of MQT  may  be  used  to  create  a  requalification  program  for  operators  who  have  regressed  from mission  ready  to  specifically  address  the  deficiencies  that  caused  the  regression.    Tailored training plans must still be routed through AFRL/DO and approved by AFMC/A3V. 3.3.  Theater  Indoctrination  Training.  AFMC  SUAS  units  conducting  SUAS  flying operations  in  deployed  locations  outside  of  the  CONUS  will  ensure  SUAS-Os  are  thoroughly trained  for  specific  theater  operations.  This  training  may  be  accomplished  in  conjunction  with normal  pre-mission  planning.  As  a  minimum,  this  training  will  include  a  thorough  review  of ICAO  procedures,  theater  unique  requirements  and  procedures,  the  use  of  non-DOD/NOAA approach  procedures,  required theater  weather conditions, local area procedures, host nations agreements, specific theater NOTAMs, Airspace Control Plan, Airspace Control Order, Air Tasking Order, SPINS, and Foreign Clearance Guide.  (T-2) instrumentation  for  specific  operations, 3.4.  Local  Area  Orientation  (LAO).  AFMC  SUAS  units  will  establish  ground  and  flying training  requirements  for  LAO.  Newly  assigned  operators  will  not  perform  SUAS-O  duties, except under the supervision of an instructor, until they complete this training. Ground training AFI11-5FTV1  27 AUGUST 2015   19  will  include,  as  a  minimum,  a  briefing  on  the  local  area  visual  flight  rules  (VFR)  procedures, restrictions,  navigation  aids,  and  unit  aircraft  differences  (e.g.  test  instrumentation).    LAO training  will  also  include  an  introduction  to  AFMC  command  and  unit-specific  rules  and directives  if  the  crewmember  is  new  to  AFMC  and/or  the  unit.  LAO  flying  training  may  be conducted concurrently with Phase I or Phase II training. Only one LAO is required for SUAS-Os qualifying in multiple aircraft at one installation.  Document this training in Section Four of the individual’s training folder.  (T-3) 3.5.  SUAS  Flight  Test  Orientation  (FTO)  Training.  All AFMC operators must receive one-time Flight Test Orientation Training prior to executing flight test missions. The training outlines the  required  minimum  reviews  required  for  documentation,  test  equipment,  test  support,  test execution, and decision criteria. To augment ground training, some aircraft test training may also include flight training.  (T-3) 3.5.1.  The  SUAS  Flight  Test  Orientation  Training  syllabus  is  maintained  by  AFRL/DO.  If required, Flight Test flying training (AFMC Form 68) may be published in MDS attachments or unit supplements to this instruction. 3.5.2.  Document  SUAS  Flight  Test  Orientation  Training  in  Section  Four  of  the  training folder and on the AF Form 1381. 3.5.3.  Any  supervisor  (commander,  operations  officer,  or  branch  chief)  or  instructor qualified  in  that  mission  may  complete  the  applicable  ground  training.    Flight  training,  if specified, will be conducted by a SUAS-I qualified in the Flight Test mission. 3.6.  Special  Mission  Qualifications  and  Certifications.  The  unit  commander  will  select SUAS-Os  qualified  in  the  unit’s  mission  to  maintain  additional  special  qualifications  and certifications. Special mission events are not considered core mission events and are not required for  mission  ready  status.  SUAS-Is  are  authorized  to  teach  any  special  mission  events  in  which they are qualified and current unless specifically restricted. 3.6.1.  Autopilot  Gain  Tuning  (AGT)  Training.  All  AFMC  Internal  Operators  must  receive one-time  Autopilot  Gain  Tuning  Training  for  each  specific  autopilot  system  prior  to executing flight test missions performing that task on that autopilot system.  SUAS External Operators  supporting  gain  tuning  missions  as  an  additional  crewmember  must  receive familiarization  training  in  AGT  mission  procedures  and  terminology  for  that  autopilot system, including a mission rehearsal or simulation. 3.6.1.1.  The Autopilot Gain Tuning training plan description and syllabus is maintained by AFRL/DO. 3.6.2.  Night  Operations (NT) Training.   Night  SUAS operations are not  normal  for AFMC operators  and  qualification  must  normally  be  obtained  via  formal  IQT  course.    If  AFMC elects to develop and publish a Night Operations training plan/syllabus it will be maintained by AFRL/DO.  All AFMC operators must receive Night Operations training and certification prior to executing missions during hours of darkness or using NVGs. 3.6.3.  Stores  Release  (SR)  Training.  All  AFMC  operators  must  receive  one-time  Stores Release  Training  prior  to  executing  flight  test  missions  releasing  stores  or  payloads.    As  a minimum, Stores Release training will include normal arming, safing, release and separation, inadvertent/unintentional  ground  and  inflight  release,  arming  and  release  malfunctions,   20  AFI11-5FTV1  27 AUGUST 2015 jettison,  hung/misfired  store  recovery  and  landing,  environmental  considerations,  range safety, aircraft instrumentation, and range clearance and test control procedures.  If energetic release systems or stores (explosives, stored energy springs, etc) are used, training will also include  special  handling  requirements  unique  to  positively  determining  a  disarmed  state  in order to safely launch and recover the aircraft with the energized system or store aboard. 3.6.4.  Weapons Delivery (WD).  This section describes procedures for aircrew air-to-surface training  and  is  applicable  to  all  AFMC  SUAS  carrying  or  releasing  any  live  explosives,  or kinetically  impacting  any  target.    Weapons  delivery  training  will  be  IAW  AFI  13-212, Volume 1, Range Planning and Operations, and if applicable, T.O. 1M-34, Aircraft Weapons Delivery Manual, and aircraft specific -34 T.O.s.  AFI 11-214 provides procedures for air-to-surface  training  for  MAJCOMs  with  tactical  missions.    AFMC  does  not  have  a  tactical mission,  but  invokes  AFI  11-214  for  air-to-surface  training.    Developmental  air-to-surface testing will be conducted in accordance with test and safety review board guidance. 3.6.5.  Additional special mission qualifications and/or certifications, and associated training plans, may be defined by the unit, with AFRL/DO concurrence and AFMC/A3V approval. AFI11-5FTV1  27 AUGUST 2015   21  Chapter 4 PHASE III - CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  General.  AFMC  SUAS  operators  will  accomplish  the  basic  currency  and  proficiency requirements specified in Table 4.1  Failure to meet these minimum requirements and regain basic  currency  within  6  months  of  expiration  will  result  in  the  SUAS-O  regressing  to Unqualified  status  in  that  event  per  AFI  11-502V1  paragraph  1.7,  necessitating Requalification  training  per  AFI  11-502V1  paragraph  1.8    The  SUAS  operating  unit commander  may  specify  additional  requirements  necessary  to  ensure  operators  maintain proficiency  and  mission  readiness.    These  requirements  will  be  included  in  SUAS  specific supplements to this instruction.  (T-2) Table 4.1.  SUAS Operator Currency and Semiannual  Basic Proficiency Requirements.

IOs  are  not  required  to  complete  events  normally  performed  solely  under  External Operator/manual pilot flight control, as indicated above by an asterisk (i.e. radio control piloted takeoff, landing, and go around procedures).  In such cases, conduct appropriate GCS Handoffs in lieu of those events.  In order to use autopilot controlled takeoff and/or landing capability, IOs must complete these requirements.   3.   For systems with only one-way handoffs, only the applicable handoff applies.  4. Events will include scenarios such as lost communication procedures, engine out procedures, etc.    Event  may  be  updated  using  ground  station  simulations/mission  rehearsals  provided  all   22  AFI11-5FTV1  27 AUGUST 2015 SUAS operator test team members are present, and team coordination is practiced. 4.2.  Basic Sortie Credit.  In order to log a sortie for currency or proficiency, the logging SUAS-O must perform at a minimum:  Launch Sequence, one Takeoff/Launch event, one VFR traffic pattern (as applicable), and one Landing/Recovery event, and log at least 0.2 hours (10 minutes) primary  (Lead  SUAS-O/Pilot-in-Command-equivalent)  or  Instructor  time.    NOTE:    Launch Sequence includes preflight checklists, aircraft preparation, engine start, and all other procedures up lieu  of  Pilot-conducted  Takeoff/Launch  and/or Landing/Recovery  events,  Internal  Operators  shall  perform  the  appropriate  GCS  handoff(s) to/from an External Operator as applicable for the system. takeoff/launch. In to initiating  4.3.  Simulator  Training.  Simulator  training  is  not  required;  however,  some  GCS  vendors provide  a  Hardware-in-the-Loop  capability  allowing  simulated  missions  in  a  lab  environment.  Additionally  the  radio  control  hobby  industry  provides  several  radio  control  aircraft  training simulators.    The  use  of  the  above  tools  for  training,  practice,  and  mission  rehearsals  is  highly encouraged. As the lead command for SUAS research and test operations, AFMC allows units to use simulator training to maintain currency but the subsequent sortie must be live.  Units unable to  schedule  live  sorties  for  currency  and  desiring  to  use  simulators  instead  to  regain  currency must request a waiver through AFRL/DO to AFMC/A3V. 4.3.1.  The  AFSOC-approved  Aerovironment,  Inc™,-provided  “Small  UAS  Simulator”  for use with the Raven®, Wasp®, and Puma systems is also approved for use within AFMC to maintain  (NOT  regain)  “Basic  Sortie  –  Simulated”  currency  in  the  Raven®,  Wasp®,  and Puma systems. 4.4.  Aircrew  flight  equipment.  Aircrew  flight  equipment  and  SERE  training  requirements  as described  in  AFI  11-301  and  AFI  16-1301  do  not  apply  to  SUAS  operators.  Proper  PPE  is required as determined by the Safety Review Board. 4.5.  Phase II/Mission Event Currency/Proficiency.  AFMC SUAS Operators will maintain or accomplish the currency and proficiency requirements specified in Table 4.2 prior to performing those  mission  tasks.    Maintain/regain  currency  to  meet  mission  requirements  as  needed. Paragraph  3.1.2  of  this  instruction  outlines  Requalification  requirements  for  failure  to meet  these  requirements.    The  SUAS  operating  unit  commander  may  specify  additional requirements  necessary  to  ensure  operators  maintain  proficiency  and  mission  readiness.    These requirements will be included in SUAS specific supplements to this instruction. (T-2) Table 4.2.  SUAS Operator Phase II/Special Mission Event Currency Requirements.
