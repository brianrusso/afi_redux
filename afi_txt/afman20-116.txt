Overview.  The  DoP  and  the  Air  Vehicle  PM  collaborate  to  implement  a  planned, integrated,  and  comprehensive  propulsion  safety  effort  that  complies  with  the  requirements  in DoDI 5000.02, AFI 63-101/20-101 and AFI 91-202.  Section 2.2 describes the use of the system safety methodology in MIL-STD-882E as tailored by propulsion-specific guidance, criteria, and procedures. Section 2.3 describes the additional safety management tasks executed by the DoP. Propulsion safety efforts contribute to the overall operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness of USAF and international air vehicle systems. in  MIL-STD-882E 2.2.  Propulsion-specific  System  Safety  Implementation  Requirements.  This section defines relationships  between  the  two  communities  (propulsion  systems  and  the  aircraft  systems)  in executing the system safety methodology for propulsion systems, implementing the requirements in  DoDI  5000.02,  AFI  63-101/20-101,  and  AFI  91-202  for  program  offices  to  use  the  system safety  methodology integrate  safety,  occupational  health,  and environmental  risk  management  into  the  systems  engineering  process.  This  section  does  not summarize  or  repeat  all  of  the  system  safety  requirements  from  the  aforementioned  referenced documents.  The  DoP  has  provided  supplemental  procedures  and  criteria  included  in  this publication  to  tailor  that  methodology  for  propulsion  systems.  The  additional  use  of  engine-specific  quantitative  probability  criteria,  i.e.  non-recoverable  in  flight  shutdown  and  engine related loss of aircraft (correlating to uncontained failures, fires, or total loss of thrust), provides a basis for more detailed risk assessment and comparison. to 2.2.1.  DoP ensures Engine TMS managers: 2.2.1.1.  Define, document, and adopt safety risk management matrices and/or tables. 2.2.1.2.  Report  annually  the  propulsion  safety  risk  management  situational  status  and guidance  to  their  respective  Centers,  the  appropriate  PMs,  International  partners, Headquarters  Air  Force  Material  Command  (AFMC)  safety  office,  and  lead-MAJCOM safety offices. 2.2.1.3.

Air  vehicle  program  office(s) the  MIL-STD-882E  system  safety methodology  into  the  air  vehicle  program’s  systems  engineering  process  IAW  DoDI 5000.02.  The PM’s lead systems engineer (LSE) will work with the Engine TMS Manager and the Propulsion Safety Manager to evaluate and respond to hazard identifications and risk assessment notifications.  This process involves integration of the propulsion-specific safety risks into the overall program’s system safety process.  As a critical part of this system safety process, the PM obtain formal risk acceptance IAW DoDI 5000.02. 2.2.4.  Propulsion system safety risk assessment types (for use with  Table 2.4 for DoP Risk Assessment Timelines): 2.2.4.1.  Baseline risk assessment must be developed following a new propulsion hazard or  safety  risk  surfacing,  depending  on  the  seriousness  of  the  new  hazard  or  risk  as described in this publication. Note: Baseline risk is the MIL-STD-882E “initial risk” that is retained in the PM and DoP hazard tracking system. 2.2.4.2.  Interim risk assessment  will be developed, depending on the seriousness  of the new  hazard  or  risk  as  described  in  this  publication.    The  interim  risk  will  represent  the reduction, if any, of the baseline risk due to inspections, life limits, flight restrictions or other maintenance.  If interim actions are not feasible, the interim risk equals the baseline 14 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 risk.  Note: Interim risk usually results from the “non-hardware” fixes possible to reduce risk exposure. 2.2.4.3.  If  any  corrective  action  plans  are  dependent  upon  receipt  of  funding,  final  risk will  be  calculated  once  funding  is  obtained  and  a  fleet  implementation  plan  for  the corrective action is developed.  Final risk is the average risk over the baseline exposure period  (typically  the  remaining  weapon  systems  life)  that  accounts  for  the  baseline period,  interim  actions,  if  any,  and  final  corrective  actions.  Note:  This  risk  is  the  MIL-STD-882E “target risk” that is retained in the PM and DoP hazard tracking system, which reflects  the  risk  level  that  will  be  attained  pending  funding  and  implementation  of corrective actions. 2.2.5.  At a minimum, risk assessments contain the following: 2.2.5.1.  Background:  Description  of  events,  photos,  drawings  or  diagrams,  and investigation  results  of  sufficient  detail  to  describe  the  history  and  impact  of  the  new events. 2.2.5.2.  Failure  Mode  and  Effects:  Hazardous  condition  description  and  an  explanation of the cause of the condition and the effects. 2.2.5.3.  References: Prior applicable risk assessments and related source documents. 2.2.5.4.  Assumptions:  Suspect  population,  usage  rates,  ERLOA/NRIFSD  ratio,  metal containment  factor  if  applicable,  life  analysis  assumptions  if  applicable,  or  future  fleet flying hour estimation. 2.2.5.5.  Risk Quantification: Future events and rates estimation, explanation of statistical techniques utilized i.e. Weibull analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, probability estimation, if applicable life limited parts  Low Cycle  Fatigue (LCF) life, deterministic/probabilistic fracture mechanics life, or LCF initiation plus propagation statistical distribution. 2.2.5.6.  Conclusions/Recommendations: Summary of risk in terms of NRIFSD rate and predicted  ERLOA  recommended  interim  field  actions  with  supporting  rationale  and impact to risk, long term corrective action concepts, and impact to risk. 2.2.6.  In parallel to the propulsion safety risk determination, notification of new propulsion system  hazards  and  risks  to  the  respective  PMs  to  be  accomplished  using  a  systematic  and phased approach IAW Table 2.4.  This will result in an increased level of understanding of the  hazard,  risk,  root  cause,  corrective  action  plan,  and  risk  mitigation  effectiveness  as  the new  hazard  investigation  process  progresses.    The  following  describes  the  notification timelines and the phased reporting content to the PMs required for any newly discovered or on-going propulsion risks or hazards. 2.2.6.1.  The  existing  Deficiency  Reporting  System,  as  defined  by  T.O.  00-35D-54, establishes the notification timeline for deficiencies.  This same timeline will be utilized as  the  basis  for  reporting  new  hazards  and  risks  as  a  function  of  hazard  severity categories  based  on  MIL-STD-882E  terminology.    Note:  With  the  understanding  that propulsion  system  failure  modes  can  potentially  involve  extensive  investigation  and engine  testing  to  determine  root  cause,  deviations  from  the  below  indicated  “final” notification  timeline  can  be  made  if  mutually  agreed  to  between  the  Engine  TMS managers,  the  PMs,  and  the  risk  acceptance  authority.    Note:  If  the  new  hazard  is AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 15 associated with  an active Safety  Investigation Board, the Convening Authority provides notification  IAW  AFI  91-204,  Safety  Investigations  and  Reports.    The  timelines described  in  Table  2.4  does  not  apply  until  notification  and  authorization  to  share  the mishap information has been provided to the Engine TMS manager. 2.2.6.2.  The timelines in Table 2.4 begin at the “time of discovery of the new hazard.” If events  make  the  definition  of  a  “time  of  hazard  discovery”  unclear,  then  the  “time  of hazard discovery” must be defined by the Engine TMS manager in coordination with the using MAJCOM and the PM.  Notification of the hazard discovery must be accomplished via  an  e-mail  memorandum  from  the  Engine  TMS  manager  and  transmitted  IAW  the instructions in paragraphs 2.2.7., 2.2.8., and 2.2.9.

The term “Quantitative Level Of Fidelity” refers to an analytical analysis (usually statistical) based on numerical data of the number of aircraft or engine parts involved, their operating hours and any other pertinent numerical facts combined with defined assumptions needed to complete the analysis (e.g. assume a 60% inspection effectiveness based on past experience of similar inspections). 2.2.7.  Catastrophic  hazard  notification  timeline:  Note:  A  propulsion  hazard  has  a catastrophic  severity  if  it  meets  the  catastrophic  definition  in  Table  2.1  or  in  MIL-STD-882E. 16 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 2.2.7.1.  Catastrophic hazard “baseline” notification must be provided within 24 hours of new  hazard  discovery  to  the  PM,  IEMP  Chief,  Air  Force  Safety  Center  Office (AFSEC/SEFE),  and  Lead  MAJCOM  Logistics  Functional  Authority  (A4).    The “baseline”  notification  provides  the  initial  “best  understanding”  notification  of  the  new failure  mode,  a  qualitative  assessment  of  risk,  the  preliminary  timeline  for  root  cause investigation, rationale for identification of this hazard as being potentially a catastrophic hazard,  and  recommendation  on  limitation  of  operations  or  continued  operations  while the investigation is underway. 2.2.7.2.  Catastrophic  hazard  “interim”  notification  must  be  provided  within  15  days  of new  hazard  discovery  to  the  PM,  IEMP  Chief,  AFSEC/SEFE,  and  Lead  MAJCOM Logistics Functional Authority (A4). The intent of the “interim” notification is to provide an updated assessment of the hazard including an initial detailed risk assessment, number of  engines  involved,  root  cause  investigation  findings/plans,  and  risk  mitigation implementation/development. 2.2.7.3.  Final  catastrophic  hazard  notification  must  be  provided  within  60  days  of  new hazard discovery to the PM, IEMP Chief, AFSEC/SEFE, and Lead MAJCOM Logistics Functional  Authority  (A4).

Critical hazard notification timeline: Note: A hazard has a critical severity if it meets the critical definition in Table 2.1 or in MIL-STD-882E. 2.2.8.1.  Critical Hazard “Baseline” Notification must be provided within 10 days of new hazard discovery to the PM, IEMP Chief, AFSEC/SEFE, and Lead MAJCOM Logistics Functional  Authority  (A4).    The  intent  of  the  “baseline”  notification  is  to  provide  the initial “current understanding” notification of the new failure mode/hazard, a qualitative assessment  of  risk  and  the  preliminary  timeline  for  root  cause  investigation.    Rationale for identification of this hazard as being potentially a critical hazard must be provided. 2.2.8.2.  Critical Hazard “Interim” Notification must be provided within 30 days of new hazard discovery to the PM, IEMP Chief, AFSEC/SEFE, and Lead MAJCOM Logistics Functional  Authority  (A4).

The  intent  of  the  “final”  notification  is  to  provide  the  root cause  determination,  fully  developed  risk  assessment  IAW  paragraph  2.2.5.,  fully developed corrective action plan and the Safety Quad Chart (Figure 2.1). 2.2.9.  Less than critical hazards classification and notification timeline: Note: A hazard has a less than critical severity if it meets the “marginal” or “negligible” definitions in MIL-STD- 882E.  AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 17 2.2.9.1.  Less than critical hazard baseline notification must be provided, within 30 days of new hazard discovery to the PM,  IEMP Chief, Air Force Safety Center Office,  Lead MAJCOM/Logistics  Functional  Area  Authority  (A4  or  three-letter),  and  HQ  AFMC Safety.  This notification must be accomplished via an e-mail memorandum signed by the DoP  and  may  be  delegated  one  level  below.    The  preliminary  notification  provides  the initial “current understanding” notification of the new failure mode/hazard, a qualitative assessment of risk, the preliminary timeline for root cause investigation, and rationale for identification of this hazard as being potentially a less than critical hazard. 2.2.9.2.  Less  than  critical  hazard  interim  notification  must  be  provided  to  the  PM  and IEMP  Chief  within  60  days  of  new  hazard  discovery.    The  intent  of  the  interim notification is to provide an updated assessment of the hazard including an initial detailed risk assessment, number of engines involved, root cause investigation findings/plans and risk mitigation implementation/development. 2.2.9.3.  Final less than critical hazard notification must be provided to the PM and IEMP Chief within 180 days of new hazard discovery.  The intent of the final notification is to provide  the  root  cause  determination,  fully  developed  risk  assessment  IAW  paragraph 2.2.5., fully developed corrective action plan, and the Safety Quad Chart (Figure 2.1).

DoDI 5000.02, Enclosure 3, requires formal risk acceptance by the appropriate authority  in  the  program  execution  chain  prior  to  exposing  people,  equipment,  or  the environment  to  a  known  hazard.    The  PM  is  required  to  document  that  the  risks  have been  accepted  by  the  following  acceptance  authorities:  the  Component  Acquisition Executive  for  high  risks,  PEO-level  for  serious  risks,  and  the  Program  Manager  for medium and low risks.  The user representative must, as defined in MIL-STD-882E, be part of this process throughout the life cycle and will provide formal concurrence prior to all serious- and high-risk acceptance decisions.”  The following paragraphs describe the AF process for complying with the DoDI 5000.02 requirement for hazards identified by the propulsion enterprise. 2.2.10.2.  For  air  vehicle  systems  in  development,  the  PM  must  work  closely  with  the DoP  community  to  respond  to  the  DoP  hazard  notifications  described  above.    This process  involves  the  PM  integrating  DoP-identified  risks  with  program  office’s  system safety  risk  management  effort  and  working  with  the  DoP  community  to  evaluate  and implement  appropriate  design  changes  or  mitigations.    During  development,  there  is  no requirement for formal risk acceptance on a specific timeline until an activity is planned that involves the exposure of people, equipment, or the environment to the hazard. 2.2.10.3.  For  air  vehicle  systems  in  sustainment,  the  DoDI  5000.02  risk  acceptance requirement  creates  the  necessity  for  rapid  decision-making  on  whether  to  suspend system  operations  (i.e.  “grounding”  a  system)  or  obtain  appropriate  risk  acceptance  to allow  operations  to  continue.    Table  2.5  defines  the  AF  risk  acceptance  timelines  that constitute full compliance with the DoDI 5000.02 risk acceptance requirement for fielded systems. Table 2.5.

For High risk hazards, the Component Acquisition Executive (CAE) (SAF/AQ) is the risk acceptance authority IAW MIL-STD-882E. 2.2.10.4.1.  In response to the baseline DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines the air vehicle risk to be high, the PM will notify the risk acceptance authority, IEMP Chief and user representative within 24 hours with a recommendation to temporarily accept  the  risk  or  suspend  system  operations.    For  the  purposes  of  complying  with DoDI  5000.02,  this  baseline  notification  constitutes  the  initial  risk  acceptance  and AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 19 will be in effect for no more than 20 days (until the interim notification).  Within 24 hours  of  the  baseline  notification,  both  the  risk  acceptance  authority  and  the  user representative must concur with the PM’s risk acceptance recommendation or direct the suspension of system operations. 2.2.10.4.2.  In response to the interim DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines the air vehicle risk to be High, the PM will notify the risk acceptance authority, IEMP Chief and user representative within five days with a recommendation to temporarily continue  to  accept  the  risk  or  to  suspend  system  operations.    For  the  purposes  of complying  with  DoDI  5000.02,  this  interim  notification  constitutes  an  extension  of the temporary risk acceptance that will be in effect until the final notification.  Within 24  hours  of  the  interim  notification,  both  the  risk  acceptance  authority  and  the  user representative must concur with the PM’s risk acceptance recommendation or direct the suspension of system operations. 2.2.10.4.3.  In response to the final DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines the air vehicle risk to be High, the PM will submit within ten days a recommendation to the  risk  acceptance  authority,  IEMP  Chief  and  the  user  representative  to  formally accept  the  risk  for  the  timeframe  required  to  implement,  validate,  and  verify  the recommended mitigations or to suspend operation of the system.  For high risks, the risk acceptance package must also be coordinated with the AF Chief of Safety. 2.2.10.5.  For Serious risk hazards, the PEO is the risk acceptance authority. 2.2.10.5.1.  In response to the baseline DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines the  air  vehicle  risk  to  be  Serious,  the  PM  will  notify  the  risk  acceptance  authority, IEMP  Chief  and  user  representative  within  24  hours  with  a  recommendation  to temporarily  accept  the  risk  or  suspend  system  operations.    For  the  purposes  of complying  with  DoDI  5000.02,  this  baseline  notification  constitutes  the  initial  risk acceptance  and  will  be  in  effect  for  no  more  than  35  days  (until  the  interim notification).    Within  24  hours  of  the  baseline  notification,  both  the  risk  acceptance authority  and  the  user  representative  must  concur  with  the  PM’s  risk  acceptance recommendation or direct the suspension of system operations. 2.2.10.5.2.  In response to the interim DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines the  air  vehicle  risk  to  be  Serious,  the  PM  will  notify  the  risk  acceptance  authority, IEMP  Chief  and  user  representative  within  five  days  with  a  recommendation  to temporarily  continue  to  accept  the  risk  or  to  suspend  system  operations.    For  the purposes  of  complying  with  DoDI  5000.02,  this  interim  notification  constitutes  an extension  of  the  temporary  risk  acceptance  that  will  be  in  effect  until  the  final notification.    Within  24  hours  of  the  interim  notification,  both  the  risk  acceptance authority  and  the  user  representative  must  concur  with  the  PM’s  risk  acceptance recommendation or direct the suspension of system operations. 2.2.10.5.3.  In response to the final DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines the air vehicle risk to be Serious, the PM will submit within ten days a recommendation to the risk acceptance authority, IEMP Chief and the user representative to formally accept  the  risk  for  the  timeframe  required  to  implement,  validate,  and  verify  the recommended mitigations or to suspend operation of the system. 20 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 2.2.10.6.  For  Medium  and  Low  risk  hazards,  the  air  vehicle  program  office  is  the  risk acceptance authority. 2.2.10.6.1.  In response to the baseline DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines the  air  vehicle  risk  to  be  Medium  or  Low,  the  PM  will  notify  the  IEMP  Chief  user representative within 24 hours with a recommendation to temporarily accept the risk or  suspend  system  operations.    For  the  purposes  of  complying  with  DoDI  5000.02, this  baseline  notification  constitutes  the  initial  risk  acceptance  and  will  be  in  effect until  the  final  notification  (there  is  no  interim  risk  acceptance  for  less  than  critical hazards).    Within  24  hours  of  the  baseline  notification,  the  user  representative  must concur  with  the  PM’s  risk  acceptance  recommendation  or  direct  the  suspension  of system operations. 2.2.10.6.2.  In response to the interim DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines the  air  vehicle  risk  to  be  Medium  or  Low,  the  PM  will  work  closely  with  the  DoP community to evaluate proposed mitigations in support of the final DoP notification. 2.2.10.6.3.  In response to the final DoP hazard notification, if the PM determines the air  vehicle  risk  to  be  Medium  or  Low,  the  PM  will  submit  within  ten  days  a recommendation to the  user representative to  concur with  acceptance of  the risk for the  timeframe  required  to  implement,  validate,  and  verify  the  recommended mitigations or to suspend operation of the system. 2.2.11.  Lead Command response to propulsion hazard or risk notification: 2.2.11.1.  The AF lead command for a system is the designated “user representative” as required  in  DoDI  5000.02  for  concurrence  prior  to  a  risk  acceptance  decision  by  the designated risk acceptance authority. 2.2.11.2.  Any baseline or interim hazard or risk notification must be responded to within 24  hours  of  receipt.    The  intent  of  the  response  will  be  to  satisfy  the  DoDI  5000.02 requirement  for  user  representative  concurrence  on  risk  acceptance,  and  the  lead command  must  concur  with  the  hazard  classification  and  coordinate  and  establish  a mutual  understanding  if  aircraft  grounding  or  operational  limitations  are  being considered. 2.2.11.3.  Formal risk acceptance packages from the PM will be evaluated and concurred with or rejected prior to PM submittal to the risk acceptance authority.  The intent of this concurrence review will be to accept the existing plans for risk mitigation or elimination in the specified time period. if interim  or  corrective  action  plan  risks  change  due 2.2.12.  Propulsion  hazard  risk  assessment  revision  (updates)  and  notification  will  be accomplished to  delayed implementation,  reduced  interim  or  corrective  action  effectiveness,  increased  unpredicted failures  or  for  other  issues  that,  in  the  judgment  of  the  Engine  TMS  manager,  warrant notification.  A PM update notification is  not  required unless the revised propulsion hazard risk increases.    AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 21 2.3.  Propulsion Safety Management Program. 2.3.1.

Engine  CIP  provides  the  only  source  of  critical sustaining engineering support for in-service Air Force engines to maintain flight safety (highest priority),  correct  service  related  deficiencies,  improve  system  Operational  Readiness  (OR)  and Reliability  &  Maintainability  (R&M),  reduce  engine  Life  Cycle  Cost  (LCC),  and  sustain propulsion  systems  throughout  their  service  life  not  under  Warranty,  Contractor  Logistics Support (CLS) or “power by the hour” type maintenance.  Additionally, CIP supports testing and maturation of newly fielded engines.  CIP develops solutions to in-service engine problems for the  AF,  other  U.S.  military  Services  and  International  participants.    The  objective  of  CIP  is  to correct  design;  manufacturing;  and/or  the  maintenance  procedures  of  parts,  components,  and support  equipment  that  limit  worldwide  engine  safety,  reliability,  durability,  and  operational capability that cannot be corrected under warranty or other contract provisions.  CIP establishes an agreed upon prioritized list of projects and tasks each calendar year, and funds the tasks above the “cut line” using AF Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E), other military Services and international partners and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) participant funds. 3.2.  Execution Management Roles. 3.2.1.  The DoP is responsible to: 3.2.1.1.  Ensure assignment and documented identification of CIP Program managers and TMS engineering managers for applicable engine TMSs. 3.2.1.2.

TMS engineering managers plan and budget for incorporation of completed CIP tasks into aircraft. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 23 3.2.3.  The  Technical  Airworthiness  Authority  (TAA)  approves  aircraft  airworthiness  type design and MILHDBK516C, Airworthiness Certification Criteria. IAW  AFI  62-601,  USAF  Airworthiness, certification  documents 3.2.4.  Lead Development Test Organization (LDTO): 3.2.4.1.  Serve as the Development  Test  and Evaluation  agent  in  support  of the systems engineering test and evaluation process, system integration and test, and transition to and certification  of  readiness  for  dedicated  Operational  Test  and  Evaluation  IAW  AFI  99-103, Capabilities-Based Test and Evaluation. 3.2.4.2.  Coordinate  the  development  test  strategy  for  each  CIP  project  or  task  that requires engine-level testing. 3.2.5.  Lead MAJCOM/Services: 3.2.5.1.  Communicate operational  goals  and  requirements for specific engine TMS CIP and  assist  the  DoP  and  Propulsion  Director  of  Engineering  (DoE)  in  establishing requirement priorities. 3.2.5.2.  Coordinate  on  EHM  requirements  and  advocate  for  program  funding  and  CIP support. 3.2.5.3.  Provide appropriate representatives to the Engine CIP Working Group (ECWG). 3.2.6.  AFLCMC Financial Management Functional: 3.2.6.1.  Manage financial activities during program execution. 3.2.6.2.  Monitor  obligations  and  expenditures  against  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of Defense (OSD) goals and provide monthly status charts to Program Manager. 3.2.7.  International CIP Participation: International participants can only join the USAF CIP program  through  membership  in  the  International  Engine  Management  Program  (IEMP).  International partners with the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) follow established separate guidance for CIP participation.  International participants benefit through cost sharing as well as improvements to the engine TMSs in their fleet.  Maintaining common configuration with CIP engines maximizes the benefits  for all members.  Common configuration benefits  both the  USAF  and  the  international  partners  or  participants  by  reducing  operational  cost, reducing  safety  risks  and  allowing  our  allies  to  fly  and  fight  together  with  the  USAF  at greater efficiency.  Each Engine TMS owner participates in cost pools of the tasks benefiting each TMS and there is no ‘task’ related selective participation.  CIP-derived improvements in components,  procedures,  technical  data  and  repairs  are  not  to  be  shared  with  non-IEMP members  and  engine  manufacturers  are  not  permitted  to  release  CIP  information  to  non-IEMP countries. Note: See Attachment 4 for guidance to compute the Engine CIP Fair Share Rate. 3.2.7.1.  Member  countries  are  invited  to  yearly  CIP  User’s  Conferences  and  planning meetings.   24 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 the IEMP  or 3.2.7.2.  Participating  countries  receive  proposed  Engineering  Change  Proposals  (ECPs) through for review/coordination.    Note:  Countries  will  receive  copies  of  approved  ECPs  and develop/follow their own implementation  plan.   Foreign militaries may  appoint Foreign Liaison Officers (FLOs) to perform as a single Point of Contact (POC) for CIP efforts. Joint  Configuration  Change  Boards (JCCB) 3.2.7.3.  Countries  may  submit  task  proposals  through  IEMP  country  managers  for inclusion in CIP.  The CIP TMS engineering manager determine if the task is considered fleet  common  or  unique.    Tasks  determined  to  be  fleet  common  will  be  added  to  the ECWG  and  racked  and  stacked  to  determine  priorities  with  other  tasks.    Tasks determined to be FMS unique will not be considered for the annual ECWG prioritization.  Note:  OEMs  submit proposals  for EAB approved FMS unique tasks like all other tasks on the approved list.  Costs of an FMS unique task will be borne by the benefiting FMS country or countries.  In case of a dispute in determination of FMS uniqueness of a task, the DoP will make the final decision. 3.2.7.4.  After  a  country’s  initial  membership  in  the  CIP  is  established,  continuous membership  is  required  to  maintain  CIP  benefits.    If  a  country  experiences  a  lapse  in service, the CIP TMS engineering manager ensures equitable costs are facilitated for all members by applying a reinstatement cost. 3.2.7.5.  International partner’s participation in an engine enhancement program for non-CIP  engines  will  be  a  unique  cooperative  process  between  the  engine  contractor,  DoD components, and International partners. 3.3.  CIP Processes.  The four inherent CIP processes are requirements generation, requirements approval, program execution, and product transition. 3.3.1.  CIP Requirements Generation:  Requirements originate from CIP partners, the USAF, other  Services,  IEMP  countries  and  OEMs.    The  requirements  are  generated  from  field mishap  reports,  service  and  material  deficiency  reports,  CIP  Users’  Conferences,  and maintenance data.  In addition, CIP proactively uses experience from the test and evaluation community,  the  Life  Cycle  Management  and  Sustainment  Centers,  engine  laboratories,  and OEM commercial experience to generate requirements. 3.3.1.1.  Prior  to  the  ECWG,  the  CIP  TMS  engineering  manager  will  complete  the requirements generation process depicted in  Figure 3.1 using Attachment 3 Engine CIP Scorecard  Process  Guide.  NOTE:    The  F135  Propulsion  Advisory  Board  (PAB)  will follow  JPO  established  processes  to  determine  requirements  generation.  Note:    This process relies on developing and selecting strategic options based primarily on safety and reliability and maintainability needs. 3.3.1.2.  Engine  Health  Indicators  (EHI)  Goals.    Top-level  engine  health  must  be managed  by  the  EHI  defined  in  Chapter  5.    The  TMS  engine-specific  plan  for  setting and achieving these goals will be documented in the ELMP.  Achievement of these goals is  the  primary  objective  of  the  requirements  generation  process.    Specific  customer-set goals  must  be  defined  for  safety,  availability,  reliability,  maintainability,  and affordability.  Note: Issue dependent metrics may also be used.  AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 25 3.3.1.3.  Customer Requirements Forums.  In addition to the top-down view provided by the  EHI  goals,  a  bottom-up  approach  must  also  be  used  to  identify  specific  engine deficiencies  and  customer  requirements.    These  inputs  will  be  collected  via  USAF, Services,  international  partner  and  FMS  participant  customer  requirements  solicitations and/or  forums;  e.g.,  MPWG  and  World-Wide  User’s  Conferences.  Additionally,  top driver  information  must  be  collected  from  Deficiency  Reports  (DRs)  and  other  usage statistics;  e.g.,  Average  Time  on  Wing  (ATOW),  Mean  Time  Between  Removal (MTBR), Unscheduled Engine Removal (UER), Maintenance Man Hours (MMH). 3.3.1.4.  Planning  Forums.    Considering  engine  health  metric  goals  and  the  specific engine issues, the CIP TMS engineering manager generates a list of proposed solutions to resolve  specific  known  issues  and  propose  systemic  improvements  for  long-term achievement  of  these  goals  (e.g.,  Service  Life  Extension  Programs).    These  issues  and solutions will be consolidated into specific engineering tasks for which the cost, schedule, and expected improvement in the engine health metric can be identified.  The Propulsion DoE will ensure: 3.3.1.4.1.  Presentation of tasks to appropriate forums such as Propulsion Safety and Technical Reviews. 3.3.1.4.2.  Development  of  plans  to  implement  the  CIP  tasks  and  coordination  with stakeholders (e.g., DoP, TMS engineering managers, CIP PMs, Lead MAJCOMs). 26 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 Figure 3.1.  CIP Requirements Generation Process. 3.3.2.  CIP  Requirements  Approval  Process:    The  CIP  requirements  approval  process  will utilize the ECWG, EAB and F135 PAB forums  to  integrate the user, technical,  acquisition, and  sustainment  communities.    Note:    The  PAB  will  follow  JPO  established  processes  to determine requirements approval.  AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 27 3.3.2.1.  The  ECWG  includes  participation  from  TMS  engineering  managers,  CIP  PMs, the  IEMP  Chief  and  Lead  MAJCOMs.    The  ECWG  will  annually  provide  future  year requirements and prioritization for the  TMS-specific engine needs to  the  TMS engineer managers and CIP PMs. 3.3.2.2.  The EAB is a decision-making forum chaired  annually by the  DoP.   Using the Engine TMS-specific requirements generated by the ECWG, the Propulsion DoE: 3.3.2.2.1.  Ensure the needs for all the engines in the CIP portfolio are collected into a single combined requirement. 3.3.2.2.2.  In  the  year  prior  to  program  execution,  rank  the  entire  combined  task  list without FMS unique tasks and establish a cut line determined upon projected funding by applying a scoring process  that is  focused on the achievement  of the AF defined engine health metrics. 3.3.2.2.3.  Technically  validate  data/outputs  from  the  ECWG  and  prior  to  the  EAB (initial approval) and provide to the DoP for final approval. 3.3.2.2.4.  Execute funded requirements and retain unfunded requirement information resulting from DoP annual approval process. 3.3.3.  CIP  Execution  Process:    The  CIP  task  list  must  be  coordinated  with  the  DoP.    CIP TMS engineering and program managers will accomplish technical evaluations of proposals prior to start of contract negotiations. 3.3.3.1.  CIP TMS engineering managers, with Propulsion DoE oversight, work with the CIP  PMs  and  OEMs  in  planning  and  execution  of  engineering  work  and  substantiation and  validation  of  improvements.    Engine  TMS  engineering  managers  will  oversee  the logistic  implementation  plan  of  each  EPD  and  provide  inputs  to  the  CIP  Program Manager. 3.3.3.2.  CIP  changes  must  be  submitted  to  the  CIP  Branch  Chief  for  consideration  and decision  action  guidance.    Safety  related  changes  must  be  submitted  immediately;  all others as established by the CIP Branch Chief. 3.3.3.3.  When the validation and substantiation of a task is complete and accepted by the CIP TMS engineering manager, all engineer development work ends, and the OEM will submit an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP).  Based on the nature of changes, the CIP TMS  engineering  manager  classifies  the  ECP  into  one  of  three  categories:  Class  I, Special Series Class II, and Class II. 3.3.3.3.1.  A  Class  I  ECP  covers  changes  in  form,  fit,  and  function  of  a  component and is approved by the System Configuration Control Board. 3.3.3.3.2.  A  Special  Series  Class  II  ECP  covers  improvements  that  do  not  involve changes  in  form,  fit,  or  function;  e.g.,  changes/corrections  in  engineering  drawings.  The Propulsion DoE is the authority to approve Special Series Class II ECPs. 3.3.3.4.  OEM support in production incorporation must be included in the CIP contract.  The  CIP  TMS  engineering  manager  works  closely  with  the  OEM  during  production incorporation  and,  once  the  production  incorporation  is  complete,  officially  notify  the CIP PM who will ensure closure of the CIP task. 28 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 3.3.4.  CIP  Product  Transition  Process.    The  final  step  in  the  successful  CIP  process  is  to transition the developed and validated products to the customer.  The process is outlined in Figure 3.2.  For hardware re-designs, the CIP TMS engineering manager ensures integration of activities. For CIP products that must be fielded quickly (e.g., safety) or are classified as a modification  (form-fit-function  replacements)  will  be  fielded  via  retrofit  using  procurement funds.  These items will be identified IAW the POM process to receive funding.   Note: To facilitate  this  critical  coordinated  effort,  the  PCoE  BP-06-24B,  Propulsion  Systems Modification  Management  Process,  is  utilized.    Despite  the  return-on-investment  (ROI) benefits of many CIP tasks, procurement budget limitations cause CIP products to be fielded using  a  “preferred  spare”  attrition  method  utilizing  Operations  and  Maintenance  (O&M) funding.    This  simplifies  the  transition  process,  but  typically  triples  the  time  necessary  to complete fielding. 3.3.4.1.  As  reflected  in  Figure  3.2,  the  modification  management  process  utilizes  the results  of  the  CIP  tasks  combined  with  other  means,  to  identify  engine  modification candidates  requiring  funds.    Modification  requirements  will  be  incorporated  into  the ELMP. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 29 Figure 3.2.  CIP Product Transition Process. 3.3.4.2.  DoP ensures coordination with the lead MAJCOMs and key stakeholders in the propulsion community. 3.3.4.3.  The  lead  MAJCOM  plans  and  support  incorporation  of  expected  CIP  products by way of attrition/retrofit.  30 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 Chapter 4 WHOLE ENGINE SPARE REQUIREMENTS COMPUTATION 4.1.  Propulsion Requirements System (PRS).  Whole spare engine requirements computations establish  acquisition  and  distribution  of  spare  engine  levels.    The  acquisition  computation establishes  the  quantity  of  whole  spare  engines  the  AF  needs  to  buy  for  the  System  until retirement.    The  distribution  computation  establishes  the  quantity  and  locations  where  the  AF will place its spare engines based on current planning policy and engine reliability.  In addition, other  computations  are  accomplished  for  repair  and  retention  requirements.    The  AF  standard system used for the computation of whole spare engine requirements  is D087Q, also  known as PRS.  An overview of PRS is provided in Figure 4.1. Figure 4.1.  PRS Overview. 4.1.1.  Documentation. DoP ensures adequate supporting documentation is maintained for the whole  spare  engine  requirements  computations  to  establish  an  effective  system  of management controls.  This includes documentation to support assumptions made, verify the accuracy  of  data  used,  validate  the  currency/applicability  of  data,  identify  data  (factor) changes  and  trends,  and  re-create  the  requirements  computation  if  required.    Sources  used and pertinent assumptions made during the computation of whole spare engine requirements will  also  be  documented.    Engine  TMS  manager  retains  with  the  computation  results supporting documentation for the time periods specified in Table 4.1.  AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 31 Table 4.1.

If Document is from… Retain for After… Acquisition Computation 2 years Distribution/Retention Computation  2 years  Buyout Acquisition Computation 10 Years The data is replaced in the computation. The data is replaced in the computation. The day the buyout computation is approved. 4.2.  PRS Management. 4.2.1.  The  AF  PRS  (D087Q)  manager  is  under  the  responsibility  of  AFMC/CC,  which  is assigned  to  AFLCMC  Logistics  Systems  Division  (AFLCMC/HIA)  Weapon  System Management  Information  System  (WSMIS)  program  office.    The  D087Q  manager  loads appropriate input data into  the PRS database  and send notification to  MAJCOM Command Engine Managers (CEMs), Engine TMS actuaries, and the PRS functional managers. 4.2.2.  DoP will: 4.2.2.1.  Initiate and monitor the Engine Spare Requirements Computation process. 4.2.2.2.  Ensure the accuracy of the computation 4.2.2.3.  Manage the schedule for the spare whole engine distribution computation 4.2.2.4.  Ensure compliance with computation 4.2.2.5.  Oversee the proper documentation of whole engine computation model software, PRS logic, and processes. 4.2.3.  MAJCOM CEMs will: 4.2.3.1.  Review  and  coordinate  all  computation  inputs  and  accomplish  the  individual MAJCOM distribution computations. 4.2.3.2.  Review  data  prior  to  running  the  PRS  model,  resolve  errors,  validate information, and provide unique command inputs during the allocation process. 4.2.3.3.  Collaborate across commands on constrained engine programs 4.2.3.4.  Interact  with  the  PRS  functional  manager,  the  Engine  TMS  actuarial,  the  TMS manager,  and  other  MAJCOM  CEMs  to  develop  (peacetime  and  wartime)  spare  engine requirements. 4.2.4.  The  Engine  TMS  manager  accomplish  spare  whole  engine  stock  level  acquisition computations  and  roll-up  spare  whole  engine  stock  level  distribution  computations  for  the TMS.    The  Engine  TMS  Actuary  forecast  actuarial  removal  intervals  for  use  in  the  whole engine stock level distribution and overhaul computations. 4.2.5.  DoP will charter activities to ensure coordination and integration with all stakeholders: 4.2.5.1.  The ERO (Engine Review Organization): 32 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 4.2.5.1.1.  Collect,  develop,  and  coordinate  factors  used  in  the  spare  engine requirements acquisition/distribution computations for engines still in production. 4.2.5.1.2.  Ensure  factors  used computations are current and complete. in  spare  engine  acquisition  and  distribution 4.2.5.1.3.  Document  briefings  presented,  decisions  reached,  action  items,  and  status of actions. 4.2.5.1.4.  Develop  factors  to  reflect  the  transition  from  peace  to  surge  to  sustained war.  The DoP will determine the need to develop mature or actual factors, or both.  The  peace,  surge,  and  sustained  war  factors  that  are  established  under  the  ERO responsibility  are:  Shop  Visit  Rate (SVR); Not Reparable This  Station  (NRTS); and Pipeline  Times,  as  provided  by  the  MPWG,  to  include  Base  Repair  In-work  Times and Depot Repair In-work Times. 4.2.5.1.4.1.  Transportation standards will be obtained from T.O. 2-1-18, Aircraft Engine  Operating  Limits  and  Factors  guidance  and  utilized  as  a  factor  for  spare engine requirements. 4.2.5.1.4.2.  Within  each  type  factor,  values  are  used  for  three  time  frames: peacetime,  war  surge,  and  war  sustained.    Factors  are  established  from  data analysis  supported  by  documented  assumptions  and  rationale.    The  sustained values  may  be  the  same  as  the  peacetime  values  when  data  are  not  available.  Supporting  data,  rationale,  assumptions,  and  decisions  are  documented.  Explanations are included in the documentation for decisions without supporting data. 4.2.5.1.4.3.  Mathematical modeling and computer simulation are used to develop factors or document why they are not used. 4.2.5.1.4.4.  The factors are developed using the assumptions that engines have a zero  wear  out  rate  and  that  all  unserviceable  spare  engines  are  capable  of  being repaired. 4.2.5.1.4.5.  Engine  factor  changes  are  approved  for  use  in  requirements calculations  when  coordination  has  been  obtained  from  the  Lead  Command  and the PM. 4.2.5.1.4.6.  Factors are re-validated at least annually and updated as necessary. 4.2.5.1.4.7.  Concurrence  from  the  OEM  is  obtained  and  documented  prior  to release of OEM engine factors to another manufacturer. 4.2.5.1.4.8.  Consider  using  the  official  factors  for  engine  acquisition  programs when  there  is  significant  military  or  commercial  performance  and  reliability experience. 4.2.5.1.4.9.  Factors  for  the  TMS  or  combined  TMS  are  developed  at  either worldwide  or  command level  depending  on  mission,  operation,  support differences, or requirements calculations methods.  AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 33 4.2.5.1.4.10.  Estimated repair pipeline times for the engine are developed to flow through each segment of the pipeline per T.O. 2-1-18.  Note: This is the average time  to  accomplish  all  necessary  pipeline  processes.    Elements  are  frequency  of occurrence,  required  manpower,  facilities,  tools,  equipment,  parts  and  technical data.  Standard pipeline times for mature engine TMS, as documented in T.O. 2-1-18, serve as  a  goal  for each maintenance, transportation and supply activity to achieve and will not consider delays for induction to maintenance and supply. 4.2.5.1.5.  Spare  engine  computations  representing  maturity  use  standard  pipeline times and a mature SVR.  The mature SVR considers the impact of both Unscheduled Engine Removals (UER) and Scheduled Engine Removals (SER) over time. 4.2.5.1.5.1.  The  mature  estimate  will  reflect  the  point  in  the  engine’s  life  cycle when only small changes are expected to occur in the slope of the UER rate curve per flying hour. 4.2.5.1.5.2.  SER is evaluated to determine if there is a stable slope, or if “peaks and valleys” exist.  If a stable SER exists, that value is used in the computation.  Where “peaks and valleys” are expected to  exist, the Engine TMS Manager will make a recommended buy decision after considering the impact at points such as the  peak  SER  value,  the  minimum  SER  value  and  selected  mid-  range  values between the peak and minimum.  Note: Groups such as the EAB, Senior Steering Groups,  MPWG  may  also  be  utilized  to  develop  factors  and  used  to  compute spare engines. 4.2.5.2.  Aerospace Engine Life (AEL) Committee: 4.2.5.2.1.  Validates,  at  least  annually,  changes  to  factors  used  in  development  of Actuarial  Removal  Interval  (ARI)  tables  for  the  distribution  computation  or  when necessary  to  correct  accuracy  of  forecasting  ARI  Tables.    AFLCMC/LP  Operating Instruction  20-012,  Aerospace  Engine  Life  Committee  (AELC)  for  Engines,  and provides  direction  on  the  AEL  process  and  outlines  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the AELC members. 4.2.5.2.2.  Recommends  changes  to  factors  (provided  by  actuaries  from  engine history)  based  on  changes  in  engine  reliability,  employment  of  weapon  system,  and maintenance  philosophies  that  affect  the  ARI  table  development.    Timing  ensures incorporation of approved factor changes in the development of ARI tables for use in the next PRS and repair computation cycle. 4.2.5.2.3.  Example  of  factors  to  be  reviewed  are:  AF/A3O  projected  peace  and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) flying hours, scheduled/unscheduled engine removal  rates,  non-usage  removal  rates,  changes  in  operating  limits  and  component life expectancy, base and depot screens, Jet Engine Intermediate Maintenance (JEIM) return  rates/NRTS,  changes  in  force  structures  and  utilization  rates,  application percentages, hour to cycle ratios, and periodic inspection requirements.  Development of factors will exclude quick turn removals. 4.2.5.2.4.  The  Engine  TMS  manager,  prior  to  the  AEL  convening,  forwards necessary  data  to  MAJCOM  CEMs  for  review  of  proposed  factor  changes  for development of ARI tables. 34 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 4.2.5.2.4.1.  The data includes rationale for the changes and projected impacts of the changes in the removal forecasts. 4.2.5.2.4.2.  The  CEMs  review  and  assess  the  impacts  of  the  proposed  changes and  provide  any  alternative  or  additional  factor  change  recommendations  to  the Engine TMS actuaries for inclusion in the review process. 4.2.5.2.4.3.  The Engine  TMS actuaries present  supporting data and rationale for their proposal to the AEL. 4.2.5.2.4.4.  If consensus of affected MAJCOMs is  not  achieved, the DoP  defers to the Lead MAJCOM for the factor changes resolution. 4.2.5.2.4.5.  The  Engine  TMS  manager  maintains  documentation  of rationale/justification for approved factor changes. 4.2.5.2.4.6.  Engine  TMS  manager  review  forecast  accuracy  metrics  for  engine removals and ARIs quarterly. 4.3.  Acquisition Stock Level Computation. 4.3.1.  Spare  whole  engine  acquisition  requirements  are  computed  using  PRS.  The  PM obtains  and  reviews  PRS  initial  acquisition  computations  prior  to  establishing  an  engine spares requirement for a new system. For CLS engines, the Lead MAJCOM and PM may use PRS to validate the contractor spare engine requirements estimates. 4.3.1.1.  Spare engine acquisition are limited to the smallest number of engines essential to  support  the  largest  programmed  requirement  for  each  increment  of  the  weapon system’s production contract. 4.3.1.2.  During  Engineering  &  Manufacturing  Development  (EMD)  phase,  the  PM  and Lead  MAJCOM,  in  coordination  with  the  DoP,  performs  an  analysis  to  determine  the cost effectiveness of making a buyout decision for the TMS engine.  If the TMS engine is a commercial or commercial derivative engine, a life cycle cost analysis is conducted that considers  the  benefits  of  a  fixed  inventory  and  the  associated  costs  for  support  and modifications. 4.3.2.  There are four types of acquisition computations. 4.3.2.1.  Initial:  The  initial  computation  is  the  first  computation  performed  for  a  new TMS.  The  Engine  TMS  manager  will  determine  when  sufficient  data  are  available  to perform the baseline (initial) PRS computation. 4.3.2.2.  Annual:  A  computation  is  performed  annually  after  the  initial  computation  to address  any  changes  (program  data,  pipelines,  maintenance  concept,  and  actuarial  data) that  have  occurred.    The  results  are  published  in  the  Engine  Life  Management  Plan (ELMP). 4.3.2.3.  Buyout: The Engine TMS manager performs a buyout computation to determine the final procurement quantity of spare whole engines for the TMS prior to the end of the engine  production  run.  Buyout  computations  are  completed  lead-time  away  from  the closure of the engine production line. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 35 4.3.2.4.  Others:  Changes  to  force  structure,  weapon  system  procurement  schedules, mission,  or  overall  program  changes  will  drive  additional  computations  during  the acquisition cycle. 4.3.3.  Acquisition  Computation  Process  Description:  This  process  is  followed  for  any  type of acquisition computation (see Figure 4.2). 4.3.3.1.  Initiate  Computation:  The  Engine  TMS  manager,  in  coordination  with  the  PM and  Lead  MAJCOM,  will  accomplish  the  whole  spare  engine  acquisition  computation and  will  initiate  a  review  of  the  PRS  model  input  factors  to  determine  if  an  updated computation  is  required.  If  required,  the  Engine  TMS  manager  initiates  the  action necessary  to  produce  the  updated  computation.    War  planning  scenario  used  for computation  must  be  consistent  with  current  distribution  war  scenario  data.    The  CEM will  provide  any  unique  command  requirements  such  as  additives,  Forward  Operating Locations (FOLs), etc.  Documentation of all additives explain how the additive quantity was  determined  and  why  the  requirement  could  not  be  expressed  through  the conventional  methodology  (i.e.,  PRS).  The  MAJCOM  CEM  and  the  Engine  TMS manager keep all documentation as long as the additive is required. 4.3.3.2.  Peace Flying Hours: The peacetime program will be extracted from the latest PA document by the Engine TMS manager. The force structure bed-down reflected in the PA document  will  be  updated  to  reflect  the  latest  approved  bed-down  changes.  If  the  PA document  does  not  contain  the  needed  peacetime  information,  the  CEMs  obtain  and provide  the  peacetime  information  (flying  hours  and  basing  structure)  to  be  used  in  the computation.  Any  force  structure  bed-down  changes  not  contained  in  the  latest  PA  will have documentation and justification for inclusion in the computation. 4.3.3.3.  War  Flying  Hours:  The  wartime  program  will  be  extracted  from  the  latest  war computation data provided by AF/A3O.  Wartime hours related to the squadrons will be revised  to  maintain  consistency  with  any  changes  identified  in  the  peacetime  program information.    If  the  wartime  program  data  is  not  ascertainable  or  provided,  previous wartime  information  may  be  used.    MAJCOMs  CEMs  may  provide  updated  force structure  to  be  used  in  the  computation.    Any  force  structure  bed-down  changes  not contained  in  the  latest  wartime  data  will  have  documentation  and  justification  for inclusion in the computation. 4.3.3.4.  Actuarial Removal Intervals: The ARIs are developed by the ERO as previously detailed in Paragraph 4.2.5.1. 4.3.3.5.  Repair  Pipeline  Times:  The  field  level  and  depot  repair  pipeline  times  are developed by the ERO in accordance with Paragraph 4.2.5.1.4.10. 4.3.3.6.  Transportation  Pipeline  Times:  The  transportation  pipeline  times  are  the standards  published  by  the  Uniform  Material  Movement  and  Issue  Priority  System (UMMIPS). Refer to DoD 4140.1, Volume 8, DoD Supply Chain Materiel Management Procedures: Materiel Data Management and Exchange, for guidance. 4.3.3.7.  Maintenance Concept: The MPWG will provide the maintenance concept (both peace and war), including NRTS rate, to  be used in  the computation, once approved by the ERO. 36 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 4.3.3.8.  Concurrence  of  Computation  Input  Factors:  Prior  to  accomplishing  the computation,  the  Engine  TMS  manager  documents  the  Engineering,  PM,  Lead MAJCOM/A4, and DoP concurrence of the input factors. 4.3.3.9.  Acquisition  Stock  Level  Computation:  The  Engine  TMS  manager  loads  the information into PRS and runs the model. Figure 4.2.  Acquisition Computation Flow Chart.  4.3.4.  Coordination  and  Approval  of  Results:  The  Engine  TMS  manager  accomplishes coordination with applicable stakeholders and submit to applicable PMs for endorsement and to the DoP for approval. 4.3.5.  Implementation  Plan:  The  Engine  TMS  manager  develops  a  computation implementation plan that is coordinated with Lead MAJCOM and PMs and approved by the DoP. 4.3.6.  Buyout  Support  Period: Before the  closure of the engine production line, the Engine TMS manager performs  a buyout computation that determines the number of spare engines required to support the applicable MDS during its planned life.  The buyout computation will document whether the computation reflects maturity [Maturity = fleet age > 500,000 Engine Flying Hours (EFHs)] or another support period. 4.3.6.1.  During  engine  production,  the  Engine  TMS  manager  determines  the  actual number  of  spare  engines  required  to  support  an  MDS.    The  Engine  TMS  manager initiates  a  computation  that  will  reflect  the  actual  number  of  spare  engines  required  to support an MDS over a period of time.  Note: Period being next two to three years, with the requirement being computed quarter-by-quarter. 4.3.6.2.  The computation reflects maturity when fleet age is greater than 500,000 EFHs. 4.3.6.3.  When  required  to  perform  a  buyout  computation  for  an  immature  engine (Immature = fleet age<500,000EFH), the first step is to identify the time period when the MDS  will  be  fully  supported  from  a  spare  engine  perspective.  Unless  separately AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 37 identified  by  either  AF/XO  or  the  Lead  MAJCOM,  the  period  to  be  fully  supported begins  with  the  delivery  of  the  last  MDS  with  the  TMS  being  computed.    Actuarial factors and pipeline times representing the supported period are developed for use in the buyout  computation.    Computation  results  are  used  by  the  Engine  TMS  manager  in recommending a spare engine procurement quantity.  Note: Depending on the estimated period  of  immaturity  in  years,  evaluating  requirement  at  various  points  may  also  be required. 4.3.7.  Small  Fleet  (ten  or  fewer  aircraft):  Before  a  TMS  reaches  maturity  and  near  term supportability  problems  are  expected  by  the  System  or  Propulsion  managers,  the  Engine TMS  manager  initiates  a  small  fleet  computation.    The  actual  number  of  spare  engines required use the projected “actual” SVR and pipeline times. 4.3.8.  Special  Stock  Levels:  Engine  TMS  managers  generate  special  stock  levels  for  small engine inventories and air breathing drone engines. 4.3.8.1.  The following percentages are used to  establish stock levels  when ten or fewer new MDS aircraft are to be procured or remain in the inventory: 4.3.8.1.1.  For single engine aircraft, 50 percent. 4.3.8.1.2.  For twin-engine aircraft, 40 percent. 4.3.8.1.3.  For aircraft with more than two engines, 30 percent. 4.3.8.2.  The  owning  MAJCOM  and  Engine  TMS  manager  jointly  determine  the operating  unit's  stock  level  for  air  breathing  drone  engines  based  on  the  operational concept, maintenance concept, and programmed flying hours. 4.3.9.  Whole Engine Requirements Considerations for QEC Kit Acquisition: The PM, with Engine TMS manager input, must determine the quantity of QEC kits to be bought. They will be bought as life-of-type items and are regulated by the quantity of spare engines. 4.3.9.1.  QEC Configurations: If there is more than one engine configuration: 4.3.9.1.1.  Requirement  for  each  configuration  is  determined  by  computing  the proportions of each configuration installed on each aircraft. 4.3.9.1.2.  The  total  raw  computational  requirement  is  multiplied  by  the  portion  of each configuration (do not round off the requirement). 4.3.9.1.3.  Each  new  requirement  to  the  ready  rate  table  are  used  to  determine requirements for each configuration. 4.3.9.1.4.  All  configuration  requirements  are  added  together  to  determine  total requirement. 4.4.  Distribution Stock Level Computation.  The purpose of the distribution computation is to determine  spare  whole  engine  operational  requirements  and  distribution  for  using  MAJCOMs and Engine TMS managers. 4.4.1.  Spare whole engine distribution stock level requirements are computed using PRS. 4.4.2.  Distribution Stock  Level  Computation Process  Description:  The  computation will be conducted at least annually (one of several events in the whole engine requirements process, 38 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 see Figure 4.3).  The computation, which requires a classified processing capability, includes participation  from  MAJCOM  CEMs,  Engine  TMS  manager  and  actuary,  PRS  functional managers, and D087Q and WSMIS representatives. 4.4.2.1.  Peacetime and Wartime Flying Hours: The peacetime program is extracted from the  latest  USAF  Program,  Aerospace  Vehicles,  and  Flying  Hours  (PA)  document.    The wartime program is extracted from the latest war computation data provided by AF/A3O 4.4.2.1.1.  The  data  is  downloaded  electronically  by  the  D087Q  manager  and formatted for input into the PRS database. 4.4.2.1.2.  If the PA (peacetime) document does not contain the needed information, the  MAJCOM  CEMs  obtain  and  provide  the  information  (flying  hours  and  basing structure)  to  be  used  in  the  computation.    If  the  wartime  program  data  is  not ascertainable or provided, previous wartime information may be used. 4.4.2.1.3.  Any  force  structure  bed-down  changes  not  contained  in  the  latest  PA and/or wartime program  data will have adequate documentation and justification for inclusion in the computation. 4.4.2.1.4.  Notification  will  be  sent  to  all  participants  for  endorsement  prior  to  the computation. 4.4.2.2.  Actuarial  Removal  Interval  (ARI):  An  ARI  is  developed  for  engine  scheduled and  unscheduled  removals  for  all  maintenance  levels  for  both  peace  and  war  by  the Engine TMS Actuaries through mathematical models, simulations, statistical trends, and historical analysis. 4.4.2.2.1.  The Engine TMS manager will: 4.4.2.2.1.1.  Maintain  documentation  of  supporting  data,  rationale,  assumptions, and decisions as an appendix to the published ARI tables. 4.4.2.2.1.2.  Screen  engine  removals  to  exclude  engines  removed  to  facilitate other maintenance. 4.4.2.2.1.3.  Consider time remaining on life-limited components. 4.4.2.2.2.  The Engine TMS actuary furnishes ARI data for PRS computation at least 14 duty days prior to PRS conference. 4.4.2.3.  Repair Pipeline Times: Repair pipeline standards in T.O. 2-1-18 is used for the PRS  computation.  The  TMS  MPWG  will  review  pipeline  times  at  least  annually  and recommend changes to the standards contained in T.O. 2-1-18 when required. 4.4.2.4.  Transportation  Pipeline  Times:  T.O.  2-1-18  is  used  for  transportation  pipeline times. 4.4.2.5.  Basing/Maintenance  Concept:  The  computation  uses  the  basing  structure contained within the PA/wartime program  document.   Note:  Addition of bases  required to  account  for  spare  engines  pre-positioned  at  en  route  locations  to  support  transiting strategic  airlift  aircraft  may  also  be  included  as  FOL.    Units  that  have  multiple configurations  of  engines  that  cannot  be  interchanged  due  to  engineering  or  safety  of flight considerations may also be considered. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 39 4.4.2.6.  Coordination of Computation Input Factors: All input factors will be coordinated with  the  MAJCOM  CEMs  and  Engine  TMS  managers  prior  to  accomplishing  the computation 4.4.2.7.  Distribution  Stock  Level  Computation:  The  D087Q  manager  loads  the information  into  PRS.    The  MAJCOM  CEM  runs  the  computation  for  their  individual command.    The  Engine  TMS  manager  rolls-up  computation  across  all  MAJCOMs  for each TMS. 4.4.2.8.  Post  Computation  Actions:  The  Engine  TMS  manager  determines  spare  engine availability versus requirement immediately following the computation. 4.4.2.8.1.  Non-Constrained  Allocations:  If  engine  availability  is  non-constrained, engines  are  negotiated  with  using  commands  in  accordance  with  the  PRS computations  or  MAJCOM/A4  approved  additives.    MAJCOMs  provide  written justification for additives. 4.4.2.8.2.  Constrained Allocations: A constrained engine is when the computed spare engine  requirements  exceed  the  total  available  spare  engine  inventory.    If  engine availability is constrained, the lead command coordinates an equitable allocation with using  MAJCOMs  and  Engine  TMS  manager.    The  lead  command  MAJCOM/A4 certifies the allocations.  Prior to the Lead MAJCOM coordination, the following will be accomplished: 4.4.2.8.2.1.  Engine  TMS  manager  provides  suggested  allocation  to  Lead MAJCOM/A4 after accomplishing the following: 4.4.2.8.2.1.1.  Allocate 100% peacetime requirement (Base Stock Level (BSL) and  Repair  Cycle  Requirement).  Determine  negotiated/projected  Depot returns. 4.4.2.8.2.1.2.  Adjust Depot pipeline requirement, if required. 4.4.2.8.2.1.3.  Compute wartime percentage against remaining engines. 4.4.2.8.2.2.  Lead MAJCOM: 4.4.2.8.2.2.1.  Allocate 100% peacetime requirement for all locations. 4.4.2.8.2.2.2.  Coordinate  equitable  allocation  of  War  Readiness  Engines (WRE). 4.4.2.8.2.2.3.  Resolve using MAJCOMs’ issues. 4.4.2.8.2.3.  Using  MAJCOMs:  Identify  command  specific  requirements  and issues. Note: Provide justification for additives, if applicable. 4.4.2.8.3.  DoP will: 4.4.2.8.3.1.  Endorse the Lead MAJCOM certified allocations. 4.4.2.8.3.2.  Resolve  distribution  stock MAJCOM/A4 based on the computation and allocation process. level  discrepancies  with the  Lead 4.4.2.8.3.2.1.  Notify each MAJCOM/A4 of their authorized Base Stock Level and War Readiness Engines. 40 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 4.4.2.8.4.  MAJCOM CEM notify applicable bases of their approved base stock level engines  and  applicable  WRE  engine  levels,  with  information  copy  to  respective Engine TMS manager.  Note: These levels remain in effect until the next computation cycle,  unless  changes  have  occurred  requiring  a  mid-cycle  re-computation,  or  as  a result of negotiations between the MAJCOM CEM and the Engine TMS Manager. 4.4.2.8.5.  Redistribution  of  Engines:  If  required,  the  Lead  MAJCOM  CEM  is responsible  for  developing  a  redistribution  plan  to  include  the  TMS,  the  losing MAJCOM, the gaining MAJCOM, and the schedule for transfer.  All engine transfers will be in accordance with T.O. 2-1-18.  The plan will be provided by message to all users no later than 30 September prior to the beginning of the FY. Figure 4.3.  Whole Engine Requirements.  4.4.3.  Consolidation  Computation  Process.  Engine  configurations  with  a  high  reliability  of on  wing  time  may  require  a  consolidation  computation  process  in  addition  to  the  PRS distribution  stock  level  computation  process.    This  process  may  be  required  when  peace requirements offset war requirements to an unacceptable WRE level.  Use of a consolidation computation is a Lead MAJCOM option. 4.4.3.1.  The  consolidation  computation  process  use  the  raw  requirements  computed  by PRS to determine peace and war requirements for units within a regional/Main Operating Base (MOB) support structure and will: 4.4.3.1.1.  Identify the bases/units that will be supported by a regional/MOB location. 4.4.3.1.2.  Consolidate the peace requirement for the individual units/bases under the regional/MOB location. 4.4.3.1.3.  Combines  the  war  requirements  of  those  units  that  deploy  to  the  same location as one requirement for that deployed location. 4.4.3.1.4.  Total and assign to the regional/MOB location. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 41 4.4.3.2.  The following is an example of the Consolidation  Computation process  for the F108-100  engine  which  uses  regional  centers  for  resupply  support  of  bases  within  their geographical region.  (Table 4.2 PRS Consolidation Worksheet). 4.4.3.2.1.  Enter  PEACE  raw  requirement  for  each  unit  in  the  “Base  Raw  Peace Rqmt” column. 4.4.3.2.2.  Total all units PEACE raw requirements within each geographical area in the "Total Regional Raw Peace Rqmt" column on the Regional Center line. 4.4.3.2.3.  Apply  conversion  factor  from  Table  4.3.  (Confidence  Level  Table)  by locating  the  range  that  the  sum  of  the  raw  requirements  equal  and  select  the  whole engine  requirement  for  the  appropriate  confidence  level  and  enter  in  the  “Regional Peace Engine Rqmt” column for each Regional Center. 4.4.3.2.4.  Continue process until all peace requirements are determined. 4.4.3.2.5.  Total  the  “Regional  Peace  Engine  Rqmt”  column  at  the  bottom  as  the “Total  Base  Peace  Rqmt”.    Enter  the  “Depot  Peace  Rqmt  from  the  PRS  Comp” directly below the base level total. 4.4.3.3.  Consolidation  Computation  Process  for  war  Table  4.2.  (PRS  Consolidation Worksheet). 4.4.3.3.1.  Determine 30-day  average peak war raw requirement for  each  until  along with war deployed location and enter the raw requirement in the “Unit Raw War Peak Rqmt” column. 4.4.3.3.2.  For  units  from  the  same  Continental  United  States  geographic  area  that deploy to the same war location, total war raw requirements for the location and enter in “Total Raw War Rqmt by Location” column. 4.4.3.3.3.  Determine  war  engine  requirement  from  Table  4.3  (Confidence  Level Table) by locating the range that the sum of the raw requirements equal and select the whole engine requirement for the appropriate confidence level, and enter this number in “War Engine Rqmt” column for each deployed location. 4.4.3.3.4.  Continue this process for each geographic area and war location. 4.4.3.3.5.  Total  “War  Engine  Rqmt”  column  at  the  bottom  as  the  “Total  War  Base Lvl  Rqmt”.    Enter  the  “Depot  War  Rqmt  from  the  PRS  Comp”  directly  below  the base level total. 42 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 Table 4.2.  PRS Consolidation Worksheet.  AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 43 Table 4.3.  Confidence Level Table. 4.4.3.4.  Consolidated Requirement will be determined as follows: 4.4.3.4.1.  Total  the  war  requirements  in  the  “War  Engine  Rqmt”  column  for  all deployed  locations  and  units  within  each  geographic  area  and  enter  in  “Regional WRE” column on the line of the Regional Center.  44 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 4.4.3.4.2.  For  the  “Regional  BSL”  column,  add  the  total  peace  requirement  from “Regional  Peace  Engine  Rqmt”  column  to  the  WRE  identified  in  the  “Regional WRE”  column  and  enter  on  the  Regional  Center  line.    (This  gives  the  Regional Center an engine for resupplying units in Peace time.) 4.4.3.4.3.  Total the “Regional BSL” and the “Regional WRE” columns for base level requirements  at  the  bottom.   Enter  the  Depot  requirements  from  the  PRS computations immediately below the base level total.  The sum of these two numbers is the total Consolidation Requirement. 4.5.  Target  Serviceable  Requirement  (TSR).  TSR  is  a  portion  of  the  computed  peacetime requirement that is necessary to be serviceable in support of special demands and where periodic spikes in removal outpace forecasted production.  TSR is not an additive requirement. TSRs are not authorized for constrained engines. 4.5.1.  TSR  is  established  at  MAJCOM  discretion.    Computation  of  TSR  will  be accomplished by analyzing PRS model results using 80% confidence factor as a baseline and varying  ready  rates  up  to  99%.  The  delta  between  80%  and  the  higher  confidence  factor becomes the TSR. 4.5.2.  Validation  and  Approval  of  TSR:  Documentation  of  all  TSRs  explain  how  the  TSR quantity  was  determined.    The  requesting  MAJCOM/A4  provides  justification  to  the  DoP with  copy  to  the  Engine  TMS  manager.    The  MAJCOM  CEM  and  Engine  TMS  manager keep  all  documentation  as  long  as  the  TSR  is  required  and  for  two  years  after  TSR  is removed. 4.6.  Additive  Requirements.  An  Additive  is  a  requirement  not  computed  through  normal computational methodology and manually added to the PRS requirement.  If PRS can compute the  requirement  with  validated  rates  and  factors  then  an  additive  is  not  appropriate.    Additive requirements  for  retaining  assets  otherwise  considered  for  disposal  or  termination  are  not appropriate.    Additives  are  not  authorized  for  constrained  engines  and  are  only  valid  for  the current PRS comp cycle. 4.6.1.  Additive requirement examples: 4.6.1.1.  Training: Assets required to provide spare engine(s) used by Air Education and Training  Command  (AETC)  field  training  teams  or  detachments  that  do  not  have  war flying hours in PRS. 4.6.1.2.  Special  Projects/Unit  Segmentation:  Assets  required  to  provide  spare  engine(s) in support of undefined tasks as directed by AF or MAJCOMs. 4.6.1.3.  Small fleet multi engine aircraft: 4.6.1.3.1.  Foreign Object Damage (FOD)/Bird-strike history combined with a normal failure could exceed computed BSL. 4.6.1.3.2.  Real-world  peace  obligation  to  support  multiple  long-term  commitments where no spare engines are computed. 4.6.2.  Documentation  of  Additive  Requirements:  Documentation  of  all  additives  explain how the additive quantity  was determined and why the requirement could not  be expressed through the PRS methodology. The requesting MAJCOM A4M or designee will forward the AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 45 justification letter to the DoP with copy to the Engine TMS manager.  The MAJCOM CEM and Engine TMS manager keep all documentation as long as the additive is required and for two years after additive is removed. 4.7.  Overhaul  Computation.  The  Overhaul  Computation  process  includes  a  whole  engine repair  computation  and  negotiations  of  repair  quantities  to  determine  the  number  of  whole engines requiring maintenance, depot and/or field, for the current and FYDP. 4.7.1.  DoP  accomplish  whole  engine  repair  computations  annually  in  sufficient  time  to  be used for the annual Repair Negotiations with MAJCOM CEMs. 4.7.1.1.  MAJCOM  CEMs  and  Engine  TMS  managers  will  negotiate  a  production requirement  for  each  TMS  based  on  computed  numbers  and  coordinate  results  with  the applicable PMs.  Once the negotiated repair levels are set, the operating commands, PMs, and/or  the  Centralized  Asset  Management  (CAM)  office,  will  commit  to  funding  the negotiated number of engine inductions during a particular time, and the repair activities will  agree  to  repairing  and  returning,  as  serviceable,  an  agreed  to  number  of  whole engines. 4.7.1.2.  MAJCOM CEMs notify the Engine TMS managers when projected flying hours used for computation of the repair requirements change outside the published flying hour document.    The  Engine  TMS  manager  determine  if  the  repair  requirements’  re-computation is necessary.  If the flying hour change will impact  repair requirement, the Engine  TMS  manager  will  re-accomplish  computation  and  negotiate/collaborate  repair requirement increases/decreases with funds holder, Lead MAJCOM and PM. 4.7.2.  Repair  Computation  Process.  The  repair  computation  will  use  the  Engine  Overhaul Requirements Computation Worksheet, Figure 4.4. 46 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 Figure 4.4.  Computation of Engine Repair Requirements (Output Quantity) Worksheet. 4.7.2.1.  Computation of Whole Engine Repair Requirements.  4.7.2.1.1.  Engine  Hours  –  Peace  (Line  1).  The  whole  engine  repair  requirements computation  begins  with  the  flying  hours  for  the  engine  and  MAJCOM  being projected.  These flying hours represent the peacetime flying hours projected for the engine  and  are  based  on  the  PA  data  received  from  Air  Staff  to  include  projected over-fly hours received from the MAJCOMs. 4.7.2.1.2.  ARI  Factor  (Line  2).  For  the  purposes  of  calculating  the  whole  engine repair  requirement,  only  the  Overhaul  Removal  Interval/With  Maximum  Time (OHRI/WMT) is used.  The OHRI/WMT reflects the average number of flying hours between  engine  overhauls  and/or  2-level  maintenance  (2LM)  repairs,  which  both occur at a depot or contractor facility. 4.7.2.1.3.  Usage  Change  (Line  3).  The  result  of  this  calculation  (Line  1  divided  by Line 2) represents the usage changes for overhaul and/or 2LM action for the engine for the computed period. 4.7.2.1.4.  Base  Stockage  Objective  (Line  4).  The  BSL  objective  represents  the number  of  engines  a  MAJCOM  is  required  to  have  available  or  “in  stock”  at  their installations.    BSL  can  be  either  computed  by  the  PRS  or  negotiated  by  the  Engine TMS manager and MAJCOM. 4.7.2.1.5.  Safety Level Requirement (Line 5). The safety level represents the number of engines a MAJCOM is required to maintain over and above their BSL to support the  unevenness  of  generations.    These  are  usually  maintained  at  the  depot/repair facility.  Propulsion Division approval is required. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 47 4.7.2.1.6.  (Line  6)  Total  Stockage  Requirement.  In  addition  to  the  whole  engines required to support the projected flying hour program, a certain number is needed to maintain a certain stock level for the applicable MAJCOM.  This total stockage level is comprised of a BSL objective and the depot safety level requirement (if approved). 4.7.2.1.7.  Beginning  Inventory  (Line  6,  1st  Column).  The  beginning  inventory represents the adjusted MAJCOM spare asset position at the end of the period prior to the time frame being computed. 4.7.2.1.8.  Asset Variance (Line 7). The total stockage requirement is compared to the assets on hand or projected to be on hand at the beginning of the period (end of the previous  quarter).    The  delta  between  the  requirement  and  the  beginning  inventory represents the additional engines that must be repaired to maintain the stock level.  If more engines are in the inventory at the beginning of a computation period than are required to meet the stock level of the MAJCOM, these assets can be used to offset either the flying hour requirement or other obligations.  This calculation will normally only  result  in  a  delta  during  the  first  quarter  of  the  computation  or  of  a  fiscal  year since a new BSL is only established once a year. 4.7.2.1.9.  Serviceable  Obligation–Loss  and  Serviceable  Obligation–  Other  (Lines  8 and 9). Engines may also be obligated for other uses which will increase the overhaul requirement.    Service  Obligation–Loss  refers  to  those  serviceable  assets  that  have been  obligated  to  another  use  such  as  a  training  requirement  or  a  Foreign  Military Sales (FMS) customer.  Service Obligation–Other represents those serviceable assets that  have  been  obligated  to  another  service  within  the  DoD,  payback  to  another MAJCOM, Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM), etc. 4.7.2.1.10.  Gross  Overhaul  Requirements Requirement is calculated using the sum of the following: (Line  10).  The  Gross  Overhaul 4.7.2.1.10.1.  Engines needed to support the forecasted flying hour program (Line 3). 4.7.2.1.10.2.  Assets  needed  to  cover  the  difference  between  BSL  plus  safety requirements  and  inventory  on  hand  at  beginning  of  the  period  being  computed (Line 7). 4.7.2.1.10.3.  The  engines  obligated  by  the  MAJCOM  for  another  use  (Lines  8 and 9). 4.7.2.1.11.  Projected  Serviceable  Receipts  (Line  11).  Prior  to  the  calculation  of  the final (net) overhaul output requirement, the Gross Overhaul Requirement is offset by any serviceable assets the MAJCOM or engine TMS manager expects to receive from any  source  (e.g.,  new  production,  return  of  low  time  assets  from  Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG), Quality Deficiency Returns where the  user  was  not  charged  an  overhaul  cost,  aircraft  undergoing  modification  or  re-engine, transfers from other services, etc.). 4.7.2.1.12.  Net  Overhaul  Requirements  (Line  12).  The  net  overhaul  requirement  is Gross  Overhaul  Requirement  (Line  10)  offset  by  Projected  Serviceable  Receipts (Line 11).  This requirement represents the number of engines that must be available 48 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 as output from depot level repair facility to satisfy all of the MAJCOMs requirements for that engine during the period. 4.7.2.1.13.  Current  Schedule/Adjusted  Requirements  (Line  13).  This  requirement considers  any  adjustment  between  current  scheduled  production  and  repair requirement.    In  the  first  quarter,  enter  current  project  directive  (or  contract) negotiated  output  quantity.    Compare  this  quantity  with  the  figure  on  line  12.    If current  schedule  is  greater  than  line  12,  subtract  the  overage  from  the  next  quarter entry  on  line  12  and  enter  result.    Continue  until  the  overage  is  absorbed.    If  the current schedule is less than the figure on line 12, the shortage will be added to next quarter line 12 requirement.  After initial adjustment has been accomplished, lines 12 and  13  will  be  equal.    These  quantities  become  the  Adjusted  Requirement.    This number serves as the basis for negotiation process and is eventually converted to the number of engines that must be input into the repair pipeline. The input requirement is what is ultimately converted to a dollar requirement for publication into the Depot Purchased  Equipment  Maintenance  (DPEM)  Brochure  via  Centralized  Access  for Data Exchange. 4.7.3.  Approval:  The  Engine  TMS  manager  coordinates  the  repair  computation  with  the MAJCOM CEM and PM for approval by the DoP or designee. 4.7.4.  Increases  to  Computed  Requirement:  A  negotiated  increase  is  a  requirement  not computed through normal computational methodology and manually added to the computed repair  requirement.    Increased  repair  requirement  documentation  will  be  prepared  by  the requesting organization.  Documentation explains how the additional repair requirement was determined and why the requirement could not be determined via repair computation process.  The requesting MAJCOM CEM and Engine TMS manager keep all documentation as long as the increased repair is required and for two years after increase is removed. 4.7.5.  The  Engine  TMS  manager  converts  Overhaul  Output  requirements  to  Input  and Funding requirements. 4.7.6.  Repair  requirement  increases  subsequent  to  the  repair  meeting  are  documented  and retained as described under paragraph 4.8.4 above. 4.7.7.  Approval of Repair Increases: Whole engine repair requirement increases during year of execution above the programmed objective memorandum will follow CAM guidance. 4.8.  Retention  Computation.  The  purpose  of  the  retention  computation  is  to  identify  engine retention  requirements,  inventory  long  supply  and  potential  excess  quantities  for  planning appropriate management action.  The Engine TMS manager performs the retention computation at  least  annually  following  the  PRS  computation  cycle,  or  as  needed  to  cover  special  program needs. 4.8.1.  Approval  Process:  The  DoP  or  designee,  which  may  be  delegated  no  more  than  two levels, is the final approval authority for excess decisions.  If the DoP disapproves proposal, no  further  action  is  required.    If  the  DoP  approves  excess  quantities,  the  Engine  TMS manager  coordinates  with  other  DoD  agencies  to  ensure  a  valid  requirement  does  not  exist for the TMS.  AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 49 4.9.  Whole Engine Reclamation and Disposal. 4.9.1.  Engines  are  sent  to  reclamation  only  after  being  determined  requirements  for  these engines do not exist within DoD. 4.9.2.

General. 5.1.1.  The  ELMP,  in  coordination  with  using  MAJCOMs  and  PM,  is  a  living,  dynamic strategy to ensure engine Operational Safety Suitability and Effectiveness (OSS&E) goals are established and Integrated Product Support (IPS) objectives are achieved throughout the life cycle at an affordable cost (Refer to DoDI 5000.02 series, AFI 63-101/20-101, and AFPAM 63-128 for additional details on IPS). 5.1.1.1.  Planning begins during the system Materiel Solution Analysis Phase. 5.1.2.  The ELMP details: 5.1.2.1.  How  objectives  of  IPS  Element,  as  applicable  to  the  engine  TMS,  will  be achieved. 5.1.2.2.  How  to  assure  OSS&E  is  consistent  with  guidance  of  AFMCI  63-1201, Implementing  Operational  Safety  Suitability  and  Effectiveness  (OSS&E)  and  Life  Cycle Systems Engineering (LCSE), while also minimizing engine operating cost.  This includes describing  the  actions  and  quantifying  the  resources  required  to  achieve  and  maintain OSS&E and affordability goals, and identifying the impact of resource constraints. 5.1.3.  DoP,  with  PM  concurrence,  may  exempt  the  ELMP  requirement  for  commercial derivative  engines  in-service  on  AF  commercial  derivative  aircraft,  certified  by  the  Federal Aviation  Administration,  and  maintained  by  Contractor  Logistics  Support  (CLS)  to  the manufacturer specifications. Exemptions may also be granted for those engines managed by lead Service other than the AF. 5.2.  Responsibilities. 5.2.1.  The DoP ensures: 5.2.1.1.  Approved  ELMPs  are  published  and  provided  to  PMs,  IEMP  Chief  and  using MAJCOM/A4s. 5.2.1.2.  ELMPs  are  annually  revalidated  and  updated,  as  necessary.    Full  coordination with  PM  and  MAJCOM/A4  is  required  at  a  minimum  every  three  years  or  when significant changes occur to the approved strategies.  Engine metric exhibits are updated annually without requiring full coordination. 5.2.2.  Engine  TMS  managers  are  the  POC  for  developing,  maintaining  and  executing  an ELMP for their engine TMS to: 5.2.2.1.  Develop  requirements  to  achieve  health  metric  goals  and  incorporate  into  the ELMP. 5.2.2.2.  Obtain  Lead  MAJCOM,  PM  and  CIP/sustainment  stakeholders’  coordination and issues resolution on the ELMP. 5.2.2.3.  Work  with  Lead  MAJCOM  and  PM  to  ensure  budgetary  documents  [e.g.; Program  Objective  Memorandum,  Budget  Estimate  Submission,  Modification  Proposal AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 51 (AF  Form  1067),  and  Modernization  Improvement  Program  Sheets]  are  updated  and submitted to reflect funding required for implementing the ELMP. 5.2.2.4.  Report  to  the  DoP  on  execution  of  approved/funded  ELMP  activities  and initiatives. 5.2.2.5.  Develop ELMP adjustments to achieve goals and reflect funding commitments. 5.2.2.6.  Monitor the engine sustainment activities to achieve optimized effectiveness and minimize life cycle cost while achieving readiness objectives. 5.3.  ELMP Content. 5.3.1.  The ELMP includes how to: 5.3.1.1.  Track  and  report  OSS&E  using  the  engine  fleet  health  indicators/metrics described in Chapter 8. 5.3.1.2.  Assess  future  performance  expectations  based  upon  the  ELMP  and  resource commitments. 5.3.1.3.  Report on lower level metrics which impact overall OSS&E performance.  These lower  level  metrics  are  listed  in  Chapter  8  and  are  used  to  isolate  the  root  cause(s)  of OSS&E deficiencies and address how each is to be corrected. 5.3.1.4.  Track and report costs and forecast future costs based on resource decisions and commitments. 5.3.1.5.  Achieve and maintain engine affordability. 5.3.2.  Strategies and activities that are addressed: 5.3.2.1.  Performance Based Logistics (PBL). 5.3.2.2.  Propulsion  System  Integrity  Program  (PSIP)  consistent  with  MIL-STD  3024 Rev. CHG-1, Propulsion System Integrity Program. 5.3.2.3.  Operational Usage and Verification. Periodic verification events (mission usage surveys,  LtF/ACI  engine  teardowns,  Accelerated  Mission  Tests  (AMT),  etc.)  and inspections  will  provide  data  needed  to  ensure  engine  components  reach  mature  life limits,  while  retaining  required  performance  characteristics  and  provide  inputs  into  the CIP, maintenance program,  spares requirements,  modification programs,  and Science & Technology  (S&T)  programs.    Data  gathered  from  these  programs  is  used  to  establish program priorities and develop execution and out year budget requirements. 5.3.2.4.  Engine Health Management (EHM) (how it will be achieved): 5.3.2.4.1.  Operational diagnostics and prognostics. readiness through affordable, integrated, embedded 5.3.2.4.2.  ET&D  and  RCM  to  enable  the  commander  to  make  decisions  based  on weapon system capability to meet real-time operational needs; including impacts and requirements from both efforts on engine life. 5.3.2.4.3.  Identify  enterprise  IT  tools  within  a  net-centric  environment  to  provide holistic view of propulsion system condition when available. 52 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 5.3.2.5.  LtF/ACI Program (If applicable, when and how it will be accomplished): 5.4.  ELMP  Updates.  The  ELMP  is  updated  when:  new  goals  are  set  and  changes  occur throughout the year.  Fact-of-life changes, such as updates to schedule and funding adjustments, do  not  require  a  re-coordination  of  the  ELMP  unless  they  drive  a  significant  change  in  the approved strategies.  However, there will be recurring dialog between the using MAJCOMs, PM, S&T community, and TMS Stakeholders in order to proactively analyze factors that may impact engine  OSS&E  and  life  management,  such  as:  system  modification,  system  mission  change, logistics support concept changes, system service life extensions, parts obsolescence/diminishing manufacturing  sources  and  material  shortages,  and  emerging  technologies.    At  a  minimum, ELMP re-coordination occurs at least every three years even if there are no significant changes to the approved strategies.  Updating metrics and program status information in the Appendices does not require re-coordination in the off years. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 53 Chapter 6 ENGINE LEAD THE FLEET/ANALYTICAL CONDITION INSPECTION (LTF/ACI) PROGRAM 6.1.  Purpose and Objectives. 6.1.1.  The  DoP  institutes  an  LtF/ACI  Program  to  determine  actual  distress  modes  of  an engine  and  its  subsystems  to  provide  better  understanding  of  distress  modes  by  monitoring engines/modules/Line  Replaceable  Units  (LRUs)/Shop  Replaceable  Units  (SRUs)  during operational use.  Once these distress modes are identified, better maintenance planning will be achieved to allow the fleet to continue to operate safely. 6.1.2.  LtF/ACI Program Objectives: 6.1.2.1.  Accelerate  usage  of  LtF/ACI  engines/modules/LRUs/SRUs  ahead  of  the remaining  fleet  to  identify  potential  premature  engine  component  failures,  enable  early analysis  of  trends/failure  modes/rates,  and  assist  in  defining  the  required  corrective actions prior to fleet maturity. 6.1.2.2.  Accurately  update  scheduled  maintenance  requirements  and  safely  extend  T.O. hardware inspection limits. 6.1.2.3.  Rapidly advance engine/module/accessory maximum life limits, so that they are consistent with the capability of the hardware. 6.1.2.4.  Enable  early  analysis  of  trending  data  to  improve  planning  and  forecasting  in procuring initial and follow-on spares. 6.1.2.5.  Identify hardware service life deficiencies and the areas that require re-design/re- work before extensive production commitments are made and/or limited funds exhausted on obsolete hardware. 6.1.2.6.  Develop CIP tasks to address design deficiencies and CIP repair tasks to address wear out modes and allow for rework and re-use of hardware. 6.1.2.7.  Identify hardware life impacts on system life cycle costs. 6.1.2.8.  Detect  any  unique  durability  problems  that  might  force  special  scheduled inspections. 6.1.2.9.  Evaluate  the  engine  controls  and  accessories  to  include  engine  monitoring systems. 6.1.2.10.  Provide  lead-time  for  solving  maintenance  issues,  developing  maintenance plans, and resource provisioning. 6.2.  Active and Passive LtF/ACI Engine/Module Groups.  The DoP will establish Groups and be the authority to explain definition maturity and use of whole engines or modules.  Below EFH definitions  and  use  of  whole  engines  or  modules  will  be  used  if  the  DoP  has  not  otherwise established for the LtF/ACI. 6.2.1.  Active Groups: 6.2.1.1.  Immature fleets (<500,000 EFH) use full engines. 54 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 6.2.1.2.  Mature fleets (>500,000 EFH) use modules. 6.3.  Passive Group.  The Passive Group will be comprised of engines/modules that have greater than average number of cycles but are not members of the Active Engine/Module Group. 6.4.  Process. 6.4.1.  ACIs  will  be  accomplished  to  reveal  defects  that  may  not  otherwise  be  detected through normal T.O. and programmed depot maintenance inspections. 6.4.2.  ACIs will be used to substantiate a life limit extension. 6.4.2.1.  Generate  safety  analysis  based  on  inspection  results  in  conjunction  with historical failure data, failure mode and analysis. 6.4.2.2.  Quantifies the potential risk of a life limit increase. 6.4.3.  LtF/ACI  engines/modules  will  have  roughly  the  same  cycles  per  EFH,  hot  time  per EFH, mission/operations time, and augmentor usage per EFH as compared to the rest of the fleet. 6.4.4.  There are two basic types of ACIs: 6.4.4.1.  Field Level 6.4.4.1.1.  Performed  at  engine  field  maintenance  facility  by  depot  and/or  Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) engineering. 6.4.4.1.2.  Performed to examine one area of the engine (e.g., hot section). 6.4.4.1.3.  Performed to identify issues with a subset of engines without the downtime associated with a depot level ACI. 6.4.4.2.  Depot Level 6.4.4.2.1.  Performed  at  the  depot  or  OEM  overhaul  facility  by  depot  and/or  OEM engineering. 6.4.4.2.2.  Complete inspection of all parts of the engine for an extensive engineering review. 6.4.5.  ACIs are performed in two primary steps. 6.4.5.1.  Dirty  layout  –  engine  disassembled  into  modules  and  laid  out  for  engineering evaluation. 6.4.5.2.  Clean layout – engine disassembled to the piece part level and cleaned. 6.5.  LtF/ACI Program Management  . 6.5.1.  DoP will: 6.5.1.1.  Assist MAJCOMs in identifying and distributing LtF/ACI engines evenly among operational squadrons to ensure full range of missions and environments are encountered by the LtF/ACI fleet. 6.5.1.2.  Determine and establish predetermined intervals for ACI engines/modules. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 55 6.5.1.3.  Ensure funds are available for ACI requirements, and that ACI requirements are addressed in appropriate contractual documents. 6.5.1.4.  Provide  the  logistics  community  with  the  results  of  the  ACI  to  allow provisioning within lead-time for supportability. 6.5.1.5.  Establish  Memorandum  of  Agreements  (MOAs)  with  using  MAJCOM/A4s describing LtF/ACI Program management and responsibilities. 6.5.1.6.  Ensure  Engine  TMS  managers  collaborate/consult  with  such  activities  as MAJCOM/A4s,  OEMs,  sustainment/engineering  activities,  AFRL  for  support,  advice, and  participation  in  developing  LtF/ACI  Program  plans  and  implementation  for  each engine type. 6.5.1.6.1.  Ensure  LtF/ACI  assets  are  processed  and  positive  inventory  control  is applied to serial numbered controlled items. 6.5.1.6.2.  Report  monthly,  by  the  seventh  duty  day  of  each  month,  status  of  the LtF/ACI engine/modules/LRUs/SRUs to the MAJCOM/A4 and DoP. 6.5.1.6.2.1.  Provide  engines/modules/LRUs/SRUs serial  number,  average EFH/Total  Accumulated  Cycles  (TACs)  accumulated  for  the  wing,  EFH/TAC’s accumulated  (month  &  total),  maintenance  performed,  and  a  brief  explanation why the engines did not meet the desired flying goal. 6.5.1.6.3.  Request supply Project Codes for LtF/ACI part requisitions. Note: Refer to AF  Handbook  (AFH)  23-123V1,  Materiel  Management  Reference  Information,  for additional information. 6.5.1.6.4.  Coordinate parts requisitions for backordered parts with the individual unit monitor. The requisition number, part number, national stock number, and quantity of each item required will be handled through the item managers for expedited shipment to the requesting unit. 6.5.1.6.5.  Coordinate  with  participating  field  units  to  schedule  Time  Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) compliance at the earliest opportunity. 6.5.2.  MAJCOMs will: 6.5.2.1.  Participate and resource support for the LtF/ACI Program. 6.5.2.2.  Designate units that will be required to participate in the LtF/ACI Program. 6.5.2.3.  Ensure LtF/ACI program monitoring systems and direction are established at the appropriate Numbered AF units and participating field units. 6.5.2.3.1.  Establish  scheduling,  maintenance,  records  keeping  functions,  parts requisition LtF/ACI engines/modules/LRUs/SRUs. procedures, and reporting procedures for 6.5.2.3.2.  Designate  LtF/ACI  Program  monitors  at  organizational  and  intermediate levels. 6.5.2.4.  Give  LtF/ACI  engines/modules/LRUs/SRUs  priority  attention  and  ensure  all maintenance actions documented. 56 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 6.5.2.5.  Ensure  LtF/ACI  engines/modules/LRUs/SRUs  are  dedicated  to  the  flying schedule to the maximum extent possible. 6.5.2.6.  Ensure participating Maintenance Groups strive to accelerate LtF/ACI engines at twice the normal flying rate until the engine/modules/accessories are, at a minimum, two years ahead of the top 10% (high time) fleet engines.  Note: Calculate “twice the normal flying  rate”  by  doubling  the  average  monthly  total  operating  time  for  the  squadron’s passive engines.  For unique fleets with high utilization rates; a reasonable goal can be set between the normal flying rate and 2x the rate. 6.5.2.7.  Maintain  LtF/ACI  engine  status  and  provide  to  the  Engine  TMS  manager  or other stakeholders as may be established. 6.5.2.8.  Ensure  LtF/ACI  engines  removed  from  an  aircraft  down  for  maintenance  more than ten duty days are reinstalled into an aircraft active in the flying schedule. 6.5.2.9.  Ensure  the  Engine  TMS  manager  is  notified  immediately  when  accessories  or major components are removed for maintenance. 6.5.2.10.  Obtain  Engine  TMS  manager  approval  prior  to  the  removal  of  any  major component from an LtF/ACI engine for cannibalization to another engine or a waiver of the LtF/ACI engine’s maintenance for continued service. 6.5.2.11.  Use  engine  specific  LtF/ACI  Project  Code  when  requisitioning  and  shipping assets. 6.5.2.12.  Clearly mark all LtF/ACI program assets being returned to the depot or to the contractor with the reason for removal and a description of the defects. 6.5.2.13.  Requisition  LtF/ACI  components  through  normal  supply  channels  and  inform the Engine TMS manager part number, national  stock number, quantity, and requisition number. 6.5.2.14.  Not  replace  LtF/ACI  engine  parts  and/or  components  with  earlier  released versions without documented prior approval of the Engine TMS manager. 6.5.2.15.  Provide assistance (manpower, facilities, and expendables) in performing mini- ACIs.  Note:  Mini-ACI  permits  a  quick  turnaround  on  engines  that  do  not  require  a complete teardown. 6.5.2.15.1.  Requested  ACI  support  will  be  within  capabilities  of  each  field maintenance unit. 6.5.2.15.2.  The  Engine  TMS  manager  provides  a  list  of  expected  fall  out  parts  and requisition accordingly when a mini-ACI is to be performed at the intermediate level. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 57 Chapter 7 ENGINE HEALTH MANAGEMENT (EHM) 7.1.  General.  EHM  processes  support  DoDI  4151.22,  Condition  Based  Maintenance  Plus (CBM+)  for  Materiel  Maintenance,  Air  Force  Policy  Directive  (AFPD)  63-1/20-1,  Integrated Life  Cycle  Management;  and  AFI  20-115,  Propulsion  Management  for  Aerial  Vehicles  for  AF propulsion assets. Additional information/guidance, is also at the Condition Based Maintenance Plus  DoD  Guidebook;  T.O.  00-25-257,  Engine  Health  Management  Plus  (EHM+)  General Information Users’ Manual; AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management. 7.1.1.  EHM  is  the  application  of  CBM+  concepts  to  aircraft  engines  and  will  be implemented  into  all  new  acquisition  propulsion  systems  and  current/fielded  propulsion systems  where  technically  feasible  and  beneficial.    The  enterprise  goal  of  EHM  is  to  tie together ET&D and RCM to enable a predictive maintenance end state capability.  However, implementation  of  EHM  will  vary  depending  on  the  TMS  support  concept,  MAJCOM requirements, and data availability. 7.1.2.  Engine  Trending  &  Diagnostics  (ET&D).    ET&D  integrates  hardware,  software, maintenance,  diagnostic  and  prognostic  processes  to  quantify  and  monitor/manage  engine health.    A  variety  of  software  applications  on  ground-based  computers  are  the  primary analysis  tools  to  diagnose  and  monitor  engine  health.    ET&D  activities  help  maintainers determine if maintenance must be performed before the next flight and/or the next scheduled engine removal based on engine operating data.  The primary goal is to: 7.1.2.1.  Prevent or limit damage to propulsion systems by prediction or early detection of performance degradation and/or failures. 7.1.2.2.  Minimize  the  deployment  footprint  by  standardizing  and  consolidating  ET&D hardware, software, test instrumentation, techniques/procedures, and base level tasks. 7.1.3.  ET&D  Data  Sources  and  Utilization.    ET&D  utilizes  data  from  a  variety  of  sources including:  on-board  aircraft  and  engine  data  collection  devices,  test  cell  data  collection devices,  maintenance  records/data  systems,  Non-Destructive  Inspection  (NDI)  and  oil analysis  data.    ET&D  analyses  will  be  used  to:  predict,  detect  and  conduct  pre-emptive analysis of adverse trends; forecast time and material requirements to optimize supportability and  maintenance  man-hours;  develop  engine  trend  algorithms  and  provide  support  to  field users by diagnosing engine performance problems; determine engine operational parameters in  support  of  mishap/problem  investigations;  and  reduce  life  cycle  costs  and  optimize reliability through improved measurement of life used on critical components. failure  management  strategies, 7.1.4.  Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). RCM is an analytical process to determine the  appropriate including  preventive  maintenance requirements and other actions that are warranted to ensure safe operations while balancing readiness  and  costs.    Through  utilizing  the  RCM  process,  maintainers  learn  to  optimize Expected  Time  on  Wing  (ETOW)  through  disciplined  analysis  and  structured  processes  to identify  cost  effective  and  technically  sound  maintenance  practices.    These  practices  affect field  and  depot  maintenance,  supply,  training,  engineering,  operator  procedures,  technical data, and other areas to ensure the most effective maintenance practices are used. 58 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 7.1.4.1.  RCM Data Sources and Utilization. RCM utilizes data from a variety of sources; e.g.,  including:  maintenance  records/data  systems,  primary  failure  and  root  cause records/data  systems,  cost  data  systems.    RCM  analyses  is  used  to:  reduce  shop  flow days,  improve  reliability  by  phasing  out  time-based  removals  and  increasing  ATOW  or MTBR, and reduce life cycle costs. 7.2.  New Acquisitions.  EHM is included in the selection of maintenance concepts, technologies and processes for all new aircraft engines based on readiness, requirements, life cycle cost goals and  RCM-based  functional  analysis.    EHM  tenets  include:  designing  engines  that  require minimum/need-driven  maintenance,  appropriate  use  of  embedded  diagnostics  and  prognostics, improved  maintenance  analytical  and  production technologies,  automated  maintenance information generation, trend based reliability and process improvements, integrated information systems  response  based  on  equipment  maintenance  condition,  and  smaller  maintenance  and logistics support footprints. 7.2.1.

General  Information.  The  DoP  and  Engine  TMS  managers  develop  and  utilize  EHI  to drive a desired behavior with standardized engine metrics that provide leadership an overview of readiness and sustainment issues.  The metrics and indicators are organized by the capability or attribute that they measure. 8.1.1.  Each  Metric/Indicator  will  be  divided  into  four  sections:  Metric  Objective,  Metric Description, Metric Methodology, and Metric Interpretation. 8.1.2.  Those metrics that have established goals will display stoplight indicators on the same page  as  the  graph  and  support  data.    The  goals  will  be  generated  for  each  engine  Type, Model, Series (TMS).  The stoplight indicators cover the current reporting period; however, stoplight  indicators  for  future  periods  are  subjective  assessments  and  require  management decision.    Note:  Metrics  that  provide  a  historical  trend  will  not  be  assigned  a  goal  and relevant stoplight indicators. 8.1.3.  The Engine TMS managers will obtain and report EHI to the DoP.

Safety. 8.2.1.  Engine System Safety (ESS): The goal of the ESS metric is to maximize flight safety. 8.2.1.1.  Metric  Objective:  The  ESS  metric  will  be  a  composite  over-arching measurement of safety risk for a given TMS.  All the safety issues on each TMS will be tracked and an overall system risk related to the individual risk of each identified safety issue established. 62 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 8.2.1.2.  Metric  Description:  The  issues  identified  by  this  metric  ensure  those  that  are identified  by  the  Engine  Risk  Management  Process,  which  is  detailed  in  the  PCoE,  BP 99-06E. 8.2.1.2.1.  A  safety  issue  will  be  identified  from  a  number  of  sources,  to  include, Deficiency  Reports  (DRs),  IFSD,  NRIFSD,  ERLOA,  test  and  evaluation,  research and  development,  field,  overhaul,  and  mishaps.  Identified  safety  issues  will  be assessed for relative risk. 8.2.1.2.2.  Assessed  risk  will  be  mitigated  through  several  methods,  to  include material  changes,  process  changes  and  maintenance/inspection  practices.  Each  risk mitigation action will be tracked via the ESS metric. 8.2.1.3.  Metric Interpretation: The ESS will present the number of known safety issues, grouped according to their risk color code defined by PCoE BP 99-06E. 8.2.1.3.1.  Each individual safety issue will be assigned a stoplight indicator of Red, Yellow,  or  Green  according  to  its  assessed  risk  level  and  its  related  risk  mitigation actions.  TMSs that have one or more red issues are scored an engine safety status of red.    TMSs  that  have  zero  red  issues  but  one  or  more  yellow  issues  are  scored  an engine safety status of yellow.  TMSs that have zero red issues and zero yellow issues are scored an engine safety status of green. 8.2.2.  NRIFSD: The goal of this metric is to minimize the NRIFSD rate. 8.2.2.1.  Metric  Objective:  This  safety  indicator  provides  quarterly  trending  of  NRIFSD rate for a given TMS.  Refer to PCoE BP 99-06E for actions to be taken when exceeding established PST on this indicator. 8.2.2.2.  Metric  Description:  Any  engine  shutdown  in-flight,  either  due  to  an  engine malfunction or by the aircrew following flight manual procedures whereby: the engine is unable to restart, or further investigation determines that a restart attempt would not have been successful, or further investigation determines that continued operation would have caused the engine to fail, or the aircraft cannot maintain level flight at a safe altitude as determined by the situation. 8.2.2.3.  Metric  Methodology:  NRIFSD  rate  is  calculated  as  the  number  of  NRIFSD  in the fleet within a time interval divided by the EFHs within the same interval, multiplied by 100,000.  This metric will show the six quarter rolling average and a cumulative value for  each  quarter  of  the  fiscal  year.    Number  of  NRIFSD  is  defined  as  the  NRIFSD  rate within  a  time  interval  multiplied  by  the  EFHs  within  the  same  interval  divided  by 100,000. 8.2.3.  ERLOA: The goal for this metric is to minimize the ERLOA rate. 8.2.3.1.  Metric  Objective:  This  safety  indicator  provides  quarterly  trending  of  ERLOA for  a  given  TMS.    Refer  to  PCoE  BP  99-06E  for  actions  to  be  taken  when  exceeding established PST on this indicator. 8.2.3.2.  Metric  Description:  An  engine  related  mishap  resulting  in  destruction  of  an aircraft. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 63 8.2.3.3.  Metric Methodology: ERLOA will be calculated as the number of engine related loss of aircraft in the fleet life per 100,000 engine flying hours. ERLOA will show the six quarter  rolling  average  and  cumulative  value  per  quarter  for  each  fiscal  year.    Mishap data  is  obtained  from  the  Air  Force  Safety  Automated  System  (AFSAS)  database maintained by the USAF Safety office. 8.3.  Availability. 8.3.1.  Net Serviceable Metric: This metric is used as a tool for managing serviceable engines to  an  ideal  level.    The  standards  for  this  metric  are  established  within  the  PRS  model  to portray the current net serviceable quantity of engines for peace and wartime in a risk format. Figure 8.1.  Net Serviceability Metric.  8.3.1.1.  Metric  Description:  This  metric  graphically  portrays  the  risk  to  peace  and  war posture based on the current net serviceable engine quantity. 8.3.1.1.1.  Peace:  The  number  of  serviceable  engines  required  to  support  peacetime operations. 8.3.1.1.2.  WRE: The number of serviceable engines required to support the Air Force war tasking. Engines required to  support a weapon system from  the start of the war until re-supply is established. 8.3.1.2.  Metric Methodology: 8.3.1.2.1.  Net  Serviceable:  The  number  of  total  serviceable  engines  minus  installed and  obligations.  Data  for  computing  the  metric  can  be  found  in  the  Propulsion Automatic  Re-  supply  Report  in  CEMS.  Serviceable  due-ins  will  be  in  serviceable built-up  status.  Obligations  to  base  possessed  aircraft  are  excluded  in  the  net serviceable computation. Obligations to depot possessed aircraft that exceed the base level Primary Aircraft Inventory are also excluded. 8.3.1.2.1.1.  Net Serviceable (Weekly Snapshot) = Total Net Serviceable – RAW + Total Serviceable Due-in. 8.3.1.2.1.2.  Net Serviceable (Monthly Average)  =  Sum  of  Weekly  Snapshots ÷ Number of Weeks in Month. 8.3.1.2.1.3.  Net Serviceable (Quarterly Average) = Sum of Monthly Averages ÷ 3. 64 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 8.3.1.3.  Metric  Interpretation:  Peace  and  war  stock  levels  used  in  the  metric  are computed  by  PRS.    An  80%  confidence  factor  will  be  used  in  the  PRS  computation  to account for “peaks and valleys” associated with spare engine demands. 8.3.1.3.1.  Peace Levels: 8.3.1.3.1.1.  Red  =  High  risk  due  to  net  serviceable  level  at  or  below  zero (mitigation  rules  allow  utilizing  engines  temporarily  from  PDM  facility  in  some instances). 8.3.1.3.1.2.  Yellow = Medium risk due to net serviceable level between zero and the  PRS  established  peacetime  resupply  quantity  (of  engines  being  produced  at time of need for during peace operations, calculated by PRS). 8.3.1.3.1.3.  Green = Low/no risk due to net serviceable level between peacetime resupply quantity and 125% of negotiated WRE that supports peace operations. 8.3.1.3.1.4.  Yellow/Green  =  Excess  due  to  net  serviceable  level  greater  than 125% of negotiated WRE. 8.3.1.3.2.  WRE Levels: 8.3.1.3.2.1.  Red  =  High  risk  as  net  serviceable  level  is  below  the  70%  PRS computed confidence level. (Not to be confused with 70% of negotiated WRE). 8.3.1.3.2.2.  Yellow = Medium risk as net serviceable level is equal to or greater than  the  PRS  computed  confidence  of  70%  and  less  than  the  MAJCOM negotiated level. 8.3.1.3.2.3.  Green  =  Low/no  risk  as  net  serviceable  level  is  equal  to  or  greater than the MAJCOM negotiated level. 8.3.1.3.2.4.  Upper  and  Lower  Control  Limits  =  100%  to  125%  of  negotiated WRE. 8.3.1.4.  For reporting purposes, the following WRE/TSR color ratings are used: 8.3.1.4.1.  Yellow/Green  =  WRE/TSR  is  greater  than  125%  of  the  MAJCOM negotiated level. 8.3.1.4.2.  Green  =  WRE/TSR  is  between  100%  and  125%  of  the  MAJCOM negotiated level. 8.3.1.4.3.  Yellow  =  WRE/TSR  is  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  PRS  computed confidence level of 70% and less than the MAJCOM negotiated level. 8.3.1.4.4.  Red = WRE/TSR is less than the PRS 70% confidence level. 8.3.2.  BSL: This metric determines if there are sufficient spare engines to support the peace and war mission to an 80% ready rate for combat and non-combat coded units. 8.3.2.1.  Metric Description: 8.3.2.1.1.  Engine BSL is the number of spare engines (serviceable and unserviceable) required at bases to support peace and war requirement to an 80% ready rate.  Note: WRE is a subset of BSL. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 65 8.3.2.1.2.  Computed  BSL:  BSL  is  computed  by  PRS  to  support  the  peace  and  war requirement to an 80% ready rate. 8.3.2.1.3.  Negotiated  BSL:  BSL  can  be  negotiated  in  place  of  the  computed requirement  (constrained  or  non-constrained).    This  quantity  will  be  determined  by the Lead MAJCOM/A4 in coordination with the using MAJCOMs. 8.3.2.1.4.  On Hand: Actual number of spare engines available at the bases, including in- transit engines (repairable and serviceable); excludes base level obligations. 8.3.2.2.  Metric Methodology: 8.3.2.2.1.  Data  from  the  Propulsion  Automatic  Re-supply  Report  in  CEMS  will  be used for the BSL Computations. 8.3.2.2.2.  Metric  Computations:  On  Hand  BSL  (Weekly  Snapshot)  equals  the  Total Qty  NET  on  Hand  +  Total  Qty  Serviceable  Due-in  +  Total  Qty  Repairable  Due-in.  Serviceable  due-ins  will  be  in  serviceable  built-up  status.    Obligations  to  base possessed aircraft are excluded in the net serviceable computation. 8.3.2.2.3.  On Hand BSL (Monthly Average) = Sum of Weekly Snapshots ÷ Number of Weeks in Month. 8.3.2.2.4.  On Hand BSL (Quarterly Average) = Sum of Monthly Averages ÷ 3. 8.3.2.3.  Metric Interpretation: 8.3.2.3.1.  Green  =  On  hand  assets  greater  than  or  equal  to  90%  of  the  Computed BSL. 8.3.2.3.2.  Yellow  =  On  hand  assets  are  less  than  90%  of  the  Computed  BSL  and greater than or equal to 90% of the negotiated BSL. 8.3.2.3.3.  Red = On hand is less than 90% negotiated BSL. 8.3.2.4.  Occasionally  the  negotiated  BSL  may  be  set  above  the  computed  level.    Color Ratings in this event are: 8.3.2.4.1.  Green = At or above 90% of the negotiated level. 8.3.2.4.2.  Yellow=  Below  90%  of  the  negotiated  level  but  at  or  above  90%  of  the computed level. 8.3.2.4.3.  Red = Below 90% of the computed level. 8.3.3.  ENMCS:  This  metric determines if the flow of parts is  adequate to support the  field requirements. 8.3.3.1.  ENMCS applies only to uninstalled engines undergoing repair or build-up where work  stoppage  resulted  because  spare  parts  were  not  available  and  supply  requisitions have been submitted.  An engine is not be considered ENMCS when in work and a work stoppage occurs for lack of manpower, tools, work space, or parts that are in repair cycle processing due-in from maintenance. 8.3.3.2.  Metric Description: 66 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 8.3.3.2.1.  Average  quantity  and/or  percent  of  uninstalled  engines  in  work  stoppage awaiting parts from the supply system over a given time period. 8.3.3.2.2.  Acceptable  quantity  and/or  percent  of  the  uninstalled  engines  in  NMCS status. 8.3.3.2.2.1.  For  non-trainer  aircraft  engines,  criteria  will  be  less  than  10% ENMCS and/or 10 engines. 8.3.3.2.2.2.  For  trainer  aircraft  engines,  criteria  will  be  less  than  20%  ENMCS and/or 20 engines. 8.3.3.2.3.  ENMCS%: The average percent of the uninstalled ENMCS engines during a given time period. 8.3.3.2.4.  #  ENMCS  Engines:  The  average  quantity  of  ENMCS  engines  during  the time period. 8.3.3.3.  Metric Methodology: 8.3.3.3.1.  Data  Collection:  The  NMCS  Uninstalled  Engine  Status  Report  in  CEMS data  will  be  used  for  determining  ENMCS%.    Refer  to  T.O.  00-25-254-2, Comprehensive  Engine  Management  System  Manual  for  DSD:  D042  to  navigate  to the NMCS Uninstalled Engine Status Report. 8.3.3.3.2.  ENMCS% = NMCS Days ÷ Asset Days 8.3.3.3.2.1.  ENMCS  Days:  Total  number  of  days  of  serviceable  and  reparable engines ENMCS within the reporting period. 8.3.3.3.2.2.  Asset Days: Total number of days serviceable and reparable engines were uninstalled within the reporting period. 8.3.3.3.3.  CEMS  compute  and  display  the  monthly  NMCS  percent  on  the  end  of month report. 8.3.3.3.4.  #ENMCS  Engines  (Monthly  average)  =  NMCS  Days    ÷  #  of  days  in reporting period. 8.3.3.3.5.  #ENMCS  Engines  (Quarterly    Average)  =  Sum  of  monthly  ENMCS engines ÷ 3. 8.3.3.4.  Metric Interpretation: 8.3.3.4.1.  Green = Less than 10% ENMCS. 8.3.3.4.2.  Red =10% or more ENMCS. 8.4.  Reliability. 8.4.1.  ATOW and MTBR: ATOW and MTBR are similar metrics that provide a macro-level indication of whole-engine and engine component reliability. 8.4.1.1.  Metric  Description:  Time  on  wing  is  the  fundamental  indicator  of  an  engine’s reliability.    An  effective  maintenance  plan  based  upon  principles  of  RCM  will  increase the time on wing of an engine to the hardware’s inherent capability.  MAJCOMs, Depots, AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 67 and  field  units  will  use  ATOW  or  MTBR  as  the  primary  metric  to  measure  RCM effectiveness and overall engine reliability health. 8.4.1.1.1.  Total and inherent ATOW or MTBR will be reported by the Engine TMS manager.    Both  measures  will  exclude  all  serviceable  built  up  removals  and  quick turn removals.  The inherent ATOW or MTBR will also exclude removals for Foreign Object  Damage  (FOD),  fuel/oil  contamination  (non-engine  related),  and  other maintenance  faults  exclusive  of  the  design.    See  list  of  Non-Inherent  removals  to exclude (Figure 8.2). 8.4.1.2.  Metric Methodology: 8.4.1.2.1.  Engine  programs  can  use  either  MTBR  or  ATOW  to  measure  reliability. MTBR is used to measure whole-engine or engine component reliability and ATOW is used to measure whole-engine reliability.  The goals for MTBR and ATOW are the same. Reliability reports will be titled to reflect the method selected. 8.4.1.2.2.  MTBR is defined as: MTBR = EFHfleet ÷ #removals, where engine flying hours for the fleet (EFHfleet) and number of engine/engine component removals were captured over some period of time, typically each quarter year. 8.4.1.2.3.  ATOW  is  calculated  as:  ATOW  =  ∑  EFH  removed  engine  ÷  #removals, where  ∑  EFH  removed  engine  is  the  sum  of  flying  hours  since  the  last  removal  on only the engines removed in a given quarter.  This is calculated manually as CEMS and  Propulsion  Actuarial  Client/Server  (PACS)  do  not  automatically  report  this number. 8.4.1.2.4.  Quarterly data from CEMS is used for EFH and number of removals. EFHs are  found  on  CEMS  product  G232,  Aircraft  Engine  Experience  Analysis  Report. Removals will be obtained from CEMS product G341, Aircraft Engine Removal and Loss Report. 8.4.1.2.5.  ATOW or MTBR is calculated quarterly by the Engine TMS actuary, using a  four  quarter  rolling  average  to  smooth  any  seasonal  variation,  and  posted  on  the Actuary site (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/21162/act/shared%20documents/forms/allitems.aspx). SharePoint 8.4.1.2.5.1.  MTBR  or  ATOW  will  be  undefined  if  no  engines  are  removed  in  a quarter;  therefore,  such  quarters  are  ignored  in  the  four  quarter  rolling  average calculation. 8.4.1.2.6.  For  each  TMS,  Total  and  Inherent  reliability  value  is  reported  for  each quarter.    If  the  ATOW  methodology  is  used  to  represent  reliability  for  an  engine TMS,  then  the  Total  and  Inherent  reliability  values  are  represented  as  total  ATOW and inherent ATOW.  If the MTBR methodology is used to represent reliability for an engine program, then the Total and Inherent reliability values are represented as total MTBR and inherent MTBR. 8.4.1.2.7.  Total  and  Inherent  reliability  values  are  calculated  the  same  way  when using ATOW or MTBR.  Total and Inherent reliability values differ based upon what removals are counted. 68 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 8.4.1.2.8.  Total  reliability  will  be  calculated  using  all  removals  reported  in  CEMS except  Transaction  Condition  Code  LB  =  Serviceable  Depot  Removal  and Transaction Condition Code LQ = Quick Turn Removal. 8.4.1.2.9.  Inherent reliability is calculated by excluding all non-inherent (or induced) removals. Non-inherent  removals are either those with Transaction Condition Codes LB and LQ or with the HOW MAL Codes (HMCs) shown in Figure 8.2 below. 8.4.1.2.10.  Engine  TMS  managers  will  optimize  Inherent  reliability.    SEMs  will  be trained in the procedures for reporting accurate data. 8.4.1.2.11.  TCTO compliance may be scheduled or unscheduled maintenance usually to correct or mitigate design problems and therefore will be chargeable to the engine Inherent  reliability.  All  TCTO  removals  are  included  in  Inherent  reliability,  unless transaction condition codes LB or LQ apply. 8.4.1.2.12.  An “unserviceable removal” will be an action that drives the engine into I-level maintenance. 8.4.1.2.13.  The Lead MAJCOM/A4 is responsible for resolving inaccurate reporting of engine removals. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 69 Figure 8.2.  Non-Inherent HOW MAL Codes. 8.4.1.3.  Metric Interpretation:  8.4.1.3.1.  IDR  provides  a  baseline  for  establishing  a  TMSs  reliability  goal  in collaboration with the Lead MAJCOM. 8.4.1.3.2.  The IDR for immature fleets (<500,000EFH)/populations is determined by using  the  engine’s  first  run  interval,  where  the  first  run  interval  is  the  anticipated average  EFH  on  all  engines  when  first  removed  for  maintenance,  including  UERs.  Deviations  are  authorized  for  the  use  of  a  higher  number  when  major  upgrades  are incorporated or a lower number when thrust is increased. 8.4.1.3.3.  The  IDR  for  mature  fleets  (>500,000EFH)/populations  determination,  (if historical  data  is  not  sufficient  or  applicable  to  determine  the  first  run  interval, inherent reliability) will be assumed to be such that 10% of the engines are currently on wing longer than the inherent reliability.  This will be done using a recent time-on- wing histogram and locating the 90th percentile. 70 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 8.4.1.3.4.  Engine TMS managers submit their  IDR with  justification and a graph of the ATOW or MTBR metric looking back three years through the Propulsion Director of Engineering (DoE) to the DoP for approval. 8.4.1.3.5.  Engine  TMS  managers  submit  to  the  DoP  a  graph  of  Total  ATOW  or MTBR  and  Inherent  ATOW  or  MTBR,  with  a  color  rating  based  on  the  inherent ATOW or MTBR relative to the goal established in collaboration and agreement with the Lead MAJCOM. Table 8.2.  ATOW or MTBR Color Rating.  8.4.1.3.5.1.  The  IDR  is  calculated  using  "hours  since  base  maintenance"  for  the past three years as reported in the CEMS G341Q Data, Aircraft Engine Removal and  Loss  Report,  excluding  non-inherent  (or  induced)  removals.  Note:  The  IDR workbook  located  on  the  AFLCMC  Actuarial  EIM  (SharePoint)  web  site  will generate  a  histogram  of  this  data  locating  the  90  percentile,  which  is  consistent with  assuming  that  10%  of  the  engines  are  currently  on  wing  longer  than  the inherent reliability. 8.4.1.3.5.2.  The Engine TMS manager initially establishes a baseline MTBR goal at 67% of IDR. In coordination with MAJCOMs the MTBR goal will be updated based on relevant information from sources such as removal trends, top removal drivers,  forthcoming  CIP  incorporations,  Propulsion  PSIP  enhancements,  RCM decisions,  build  policies  and  EHM  enhancements  to  adjust  MTBR  goals  up  or down accordingly. 8.4.2.  SVR  (Shop  Visit  Rate):  The  SVR  is  another  indicator  used  to  measure  a  TMS’s reliability.    This  indicator  tracks  the  number  of  engines  removed  from  aircraft  and subsequently sent to an intermediate maintenance shop or a depot for repair. 8.4.2.1.  Metric  Methodology:  The  number  of  engines  removed  from  aircraft  for  all reasons (SER + UER + TCTO ER) and subsequently sent to an intermediate maintenance shop  or  a  depot  for  repair  within  a  time  interval  divided  by  the  EFH  within  the  same interval,  multiplied  by  1000.  Excludes  quick  turn  (LQ)  and  serviceable  (LB)  engine removals. 8.4.2.2.  Metric Interpretation: The total SVR is considered inverse of the total ATOW or total MTBR; therefore the goals for total SV will be the inverse of those goals listed for the total ATOW or total MTBR. 8.4.3.  SERs:  The  SER  (Scheduled  Engine  Removal)  rate  is  a  trend  metric;  therefore,  this indicator will be presented to show the historical trend of SER. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 71 8.4.3.1.  Metric Description: SERs are the removals as scheduled by the applicable T.O. Scheduled removals for TCTO compliance are not included. 8.4.3.2.  Metric  Methodology:  The  number  of  engines  removed  from  aircraft  and subsequently sent to an intermediate maintenance shop or a depot for repair as scheduled by the applicable T.O. within a time interval divided by the EFH within the same interval, multiplied by 1000. Excludes quick turn (LQ) and serviceable (LB) engine removals. 8.4.4.  UERs: The UER (Unscheduled Engine Removal) rate is a trend metric, therefore this indicator will be presented to show the historical trend of UER. 8.4.4.1.  Metric  Description:  UERs  are  removals  caused  by  an  inherent  engine malfunction(s).  Engine  removals  resulting  from  TCTO  inspections  performed  with engine uninstalled are classified as UER.  Note:  Inherent engine removal HMC’s include unscheduled,  scheduled  and  non-usage.    There  are  also  unscheduled  non-inherent removal codes.  Actuaries currently include only unscheduled removals in this metric. 8.4.4.2.  Metric  Methodology:  The  number  of  engines  removed  from  aircraft  and subsequently  sent  to  an  intermediate  maintenance  shop  or  a  depot  for  repair  divided  by the  EFH  within  the  same  interval,  multiplied  by  1000.  Excludes  quick  turn  (LQ)  and serviceable (LB) engine removals. 8.5.  Maintainability. 8.5.1.  Maintenance Man-Hours Per Engine Flying Hour (MMH/EFH): 8.5.1.1.  Metric Objective: Be a macro level metric to measure maintainability of a TMS. 8.5.1.2.  Metric Description: This metric measures man-hours required for fault isolation and  checkout,  engine  removal  and  replacement,  engine  buildup  and  teardown,  module component and part repair or adjustment, component removal and replacement, installed maintenance  and  all  scheduled  inspections,  service  and  maintenance  include  TCTO accomplishments. 8.5.1.3.  Metric  Methodology:  Total  MMH/EFH  rate  as  reported  in  the  Logistics, Installations, and Mission Support – Enterprise View (LIMS-EV) system. 8.5.1.4.  Metric  Interpretation:    In  coordination  with  MAJCOM/A4s  and  engine  TMS manager,  the  MMH/EFH  goal  is  recommended  by  each  engine  TMS  manager  at  their respective Maintenance Planning Working Group. 72 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 Table 8.3.  MMH/EFH Goals.  8.5.2.  Organizational Maintenance Man Hours per Engine Flying Hours (OMMH/EFH): 8.5.2.1.  Metric  Objective:  This  indicator  measures  the  operational  maintainability  of  a TMS by quarterly showing the trend of OMMH/EFH. 8.5.2.2.  Metric  Description:  This  metric  measures  man-hours  required  for  activities chargeable to engines that take place at the organizational level of maintenance. 8.5.2.3.  Metric  Methodology:  Organizational  MMH/EFH  rate  is  reported  in  the  LIMS-EV system. 8.5.2.4.  Metric  Interpretation:  In coordination with  MAJCOM/A4s and PM, the Engine TMS manager determines the OMMH/EFH goal. 8.5.3.  Intermediate Maintenance Man Hours per Engine Flying Hours (IMMH/EFH): 8.5.3.1.  Metric Objective: This indicator is aimed at measuring maintainability of a TMS at the intermediate level by quarterly showing the historical trend of IMMH/EFH. 8.5.3.2.  Metric  Description:  This  indicator  measures  man-hours  required  for  those activities chargeable to engines that take place at the intermediate level of maintenance. 8.5.3.3.  Metric Methodology: The IMMH/EFH rate will be as reported in the LIMS-EV system. 8.5.3.4. Metric  Interpretation:  In coordination with  MAJCOM/A4s and PM, the Engine TMS manager determines the IMMH/EFH goal. 8.5.4.  TCTO Maintenance Man Hours per Engine Flying Hours (TCTO MMH/EFH): 8.5.4.1.  Metric  Objective:  This  indicator  is  aimed  at  measuring  the  TCTO  related maintenance  activities  of  a  TMS  by  quarterly  showing  the  historical  trend  of  TCTO MMH/EFH. 8.5.4.2.  Metric Description: This metric measures man-hours required for those activities chargeable to engines that take place as a result of TCTOs. 8.5.4.3.  Metric Methodology: TCTO MMH/ EFH rate will be as reported in the LIMS-EV system. 8.5.4.4.  Metric  Interpretation:  In coordination with  MAJCOM/A4s and PM, the Engine TMS manager determines the TCTO MMH/EFH goal. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 73 8.6.  Affordability. 8.6.1.  CPEFH. 8.6.1.1.  Metric Objective: 8.6.1.1.1.  Monitor engine TMS operating cost contribution to overall weapon system cost. 8.6.1.1.2.  Determine  if  supply  support,  the  air  logistics  complexes  and  MAJCOM operating  units  are  working  effectively  to  control  and  reduce  operating  and  support costs. 8.6.1.2.  Metric  Description:  CPEFH  provides  total  operating  cost  to  operate  an  engine type.  CPEFH is calculated by the Engine TMS manager using standard OSD O&S cost elements  and the following formula:  Depot  Level Reparable (DLRs) + General  Support Division (GSD) + DPEM + O & I Level Maintenance.  Flying hours are shown but not a part of calculation. 8.6.1.3.  Metric Methodology: 8.6.1.3.1.  Information required for calculation will be obtained from Air Force Total Ownership  Cost  (AFTOC)  database  and/or  contract  reports  for  those  engine  TMS supported by contractor logistics support (CLS). 8.6.1.3.2.  AFTOC elements used include Level 2 and 3 Cost Analysis Improvement Group  (CAIG)  elements  (https://aftoc.hill.af.mil):  Depot  Level  Reparable  (Flying DLR)  –  CAIG  element  2.3.1,  Consumables  (GSD)  –  CAIG  element  2.2.1,  Depot Maintenance  (not  DLRs)  –  CAIG  element  4.1.3.1,  Organizational  Maintenance  – CAIG element 1.2.1, and Intermediate Level Maintenance – CAIG element 1.2.2. 8.6.1.3.3.  Engine  Flying  Hours  will  be  as  reported  in  CEMS  and  available  on  the Actuary site (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/21162/act/shared%20documents/forms/allitems.aspx) for each Engine Management Group SharePoint 8.6.1.3.4.  Accuracy of AFTOC data for the Depot Maintenance (CAIG Element 4.0) is verified by comparing to actual historical data. Each fiscal year whole engine input schedule and sales price are checked. If the resulting amount is within +/- 5% of the AFTOC  amount,  no  further  action  is  required.  If  the  variance  exceeds  +/-  5%,  then the actual historical data will be used. Note: Notify AFTOC and the MAJCOM of the discrepancy  and  request  a  review  by  AFTOC  to  determine  the  source  of  the discrepancy. 8.6.1.4.  Metric Interpretation: Engine TMS manager will evaluate cost increase/decrease and use as a product support integration tool between various product support providers and the MAJCOMs. 8.6.2.  Cost Reduction: 8.6.2.1.  Metric Objective: 8.6.2.1.1.  Track  development,  implementation,  and  benefit  of  efforts  to  drive  down overall propulsion costs. 74 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 8.6.2.2.  Metric  Description:  Cost  reduction  is  a  metric  for  an  engine  TMS  or  program that is measured by comparing cost versus benefit of engine affordability initiatives. 8.6.2.3.  Metric Methodology: 8.6.2.3.1.  Information  required  for  calculation  will  be  obtained  from  a  variety  of sources;  e.g.,  CEMS  and  AFTOC  database.  Engine  TMS  or  program  managers  will input and track cost reduction initiatives by projected versus actual cost and benefit. 8.6.2.4.  Metric  Interpretation:  Engine  TMS  or  program  manager  implement  cost reduction initiatives to drive down engine contribution to overall life cycle costs. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 75 Chapter 9 ENGINE LEADING HEALTH INDICATORS (LHIS) 9.1.  General.  This chapter directs the LHI process for propulsion systems health reporting and the  criteria  for  evaluating  these  indicators.  Applicability  of  this  quarterly  process  is  to  assess future WRE outlook.  The objective is to drive a desired program behavior with standardized risk identification  and  provide  leadership  a  comprehensive  overview  of  readiness  and  sustainment issues.  The indicators will  be organized by the capability or attribute that they are intended to measure.  There  are  six  elements  that  trigger  changes  in  WRE  outlook:  Requirements, Production,  Supportability,  Safety/Quality,  Operational  Trends,  and  Funding/Resources.  (See Figure 9.1.) Figure 9.1.  LHI Overview.  9.1.1.  The Lead Engine TMS manager is accountable to the DoP for status and information collected from stakeholders. 9.1.2.  Engine TMS managers will complete an LHI assessment quarterly within the FY and update with current data as applicable. 9.1.2.1.  Engine  TMS  managers  will  coordinate  with  Lead  Command,  AFLCMC,  DLA, AFSC,  other  MAJCOMs  as  required,  source  of  supply,  OEMs,  and  SOR  when performing  LHI  assessments  and  accessing  program  status.    Final  authority  of  program status  rests  with  the  Lead  Engine  TMS  manager  based  on  information  collected  from stakeholders. 76 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 9.1.2.2.  Each element will be assigned a red, yellow green rating based on 6, 12, and 36 months  impact  to  WRE.    The  Lead  Engine  TMS  manager  assigns  the  rating  based  on overarching risk to fleet health using the complete assessment as a tool: 9.1.2.2.1.  Rate  each  assessment  sub-element  to  assist  in  determining  the  overall element rating. In the Response column, provide justification for the suggested rating. Ensure  justification  references  the  sub-element  and  can  stand  alone  as  a  bullet  as back-up. 9.1.2.2.2.  Rate elements/sub-elements red if risk goes uncorrected, it will negatively impact WRE or require extreme measures to mitigate the risk. 9.1.2.2.3.  Rate elements/sub-elements yellow if watch item for risk to WRE; yellow sub-elements are not currently a risk to WRE but need to be investigated. 9.1.2.2.4.  Rate  elements/sub-elements  green  if  low  risk  to  WRE  and  no  issues  are projected within lead-time (e.g., future POM to cover issue). 9.1.3.  The overall Engine TMS engine rating is  based on the  Lead Engine TMS manager’s cumulative subjective assessment and presented to the DoP.  The DoP is accountable for the resolution action plan. 9.1.3.1.  There  is  no  set  rule  for  how  many  reds,  yellows  or  greens  make  an  overall element  red,  yellow  or  green;  the  Lead  Engine  TMS  manager  determines  based  on impacts to WRE. 9.1.3.2.  If  the  rating  is  red,  the  sub-element  of:  (W)  –Watch,  (I)  –  Investigating,  (A)  – Action must be identified. 9.1.3.3.  Briefing charts: 9.1.3.3.1.  Change to rated LHI elements will be indicated by an oval circle/previous quarter color rating on the LHI Overview briefing chart. 9.1.3.3.2.  Red rated elements/sub-elements requiring action will have backup slide(s) that clearly identify the risk, impact, and mitigation plan. 9.1.3.3.3.  Yellow  rated  elements/sub-elements  do  not  require  a  back-up  slide  but  is up to discretion of PM.  DARLENE J.

EHM Systems are comprised of various hardware and  software  components,  including  but  not  limited  to,  on-board  aircraft  and  engine  data collection devices and test cell data collection devices. Additional data sources may include, but are  not  limited  to,  maintenance  and  oil  analysis  data  available  from  other  data  systems.  EHM Systems  use  a  variety  of  software  applications  on  ground-based  computers  to  process  data  and diagnose and monitor engine health. Expected Time on Wing (ETOW)—ETOW is the projected average time on wing expected to result  from  application  of  a  specific  maintenance  work-scope  to  a  specific  engine.  ETOW  is calculated from the statistical distribution of times on wing predicted for a specific engine build. ETOW is a forward looking indicator, as opposed to ATOW which is a historical indicator. Factor—A value used in assessments and in computing requirements. Factors are developed for peace (readiness), and for war (surge and sustained). Forecasted Factors—Factors developed which predict what the official factors will be when the engine  has  reached  stability.

Propulsion Requirements System (PRS)—(WSMIS /PRS (D087Q)) is the Air Force standard system  for  the  computation  of:  whole  engine  stock  levels  for  both  acquisition  and  distribution, overhaul  requirements,  and  retention  requirements.  PRS  must  provide  WSMIS/SAM  (D087C) with the computational data needed to assess whole engines and modules for Status of Resources and Training (SORTS). Propulsion Safety Threshold (PST)—A risk management term used to refer to the DoP defined Risk Thresholds for Non-Recoverable In-flight engine Shutdown (NRIFSD) and Engine Related Loss  of  Aircraft  (ERLOA).  It  is  used  to  determine  if/when  corrective  action  is  necessary  to reduce risk to an acceptable level. Propulsion System—Any air breathing AF propulsion item to include gas turbine engines, reciprocating engines, fuel cells driven propulsive fan/distributed fan, battery driven propulsive fan/distributed fan systems for manned and unmanned aerial vehicles as well as missiles.

Sustainability  Assessment  Module  (SAM)—SAM  predicts  the  combat  capability  of  tactical, strategic,  and  airlift  weapon  systems  for  a  given  set  of  operations  plans,  logistics  assets,  and logistics  performance  factors.  SAM  provides  insight  into  how  well  the  on-hand-logistics resources (spares,  engines, and consumables) support the wartime tasking. SAM also  identifies potential  logistics  limitations  (i.e.,  resources  and  processes)  which  need  to  be  improved  to increase the probability that required performance levels will be met. Target  Serviceable  Requirement  (TSR)—TSR  is  the  portion  of  the  computed  peacetime requirement that is necessary to be serviceable in support of special requirements.

Consistent  with  the  USAF  Engine  Health  Indicator  (EHI)  guidance  of  Chapter  8, this scorecard will serve as a tool for the DoP Propulsion Division Chiefs, and Lead MAJCOMs to reach funding decisions regarding candidate projects and tasks. The scorecard is not the sole determinant, but rather one tool to help guide this decision process. A2.2.  All  propulsion  systems  are  monitored  for  the  health  of  their  programs  using operationally  relevant  health  metrics  of  Safety,  Availability,  Reliability,  Maintainability  and Affordability compared to customer identified goals. The CIP is utilized to address shortfalls and develop strategy plans which are documented in the individual ELMP. Candidate CIP tasks can be identified from a variety of means including: A2.2.1.  Operationally  identified  deficiencies  surfaced  through  mishap  and  deficiency reports. A2.2.2.  Maintenance data trends. A2.2.3.  Test  and  evaluation  programs  including  accelerated  mission  tests,  lead  the  fleet programs and analytical inspections. A2.2.4.  Depot maintenance and repair improvements. A2.2.5.  Top  material  cost  drivers  as  identified  by  the  AFTOC  system.  AFTOC  is  the authoritative source across the Air Force for financial, acquisition, and logistics information. A2.3.  Process  Guidance:  The  scoring  process  is  composed  of  two  parts  as  shown  in  Figure A2.1. A2.3.1.  The CIP TMS Engineering Manager will generate a candidate project/task list which will  be  scored  by  the  engineering  manager  using  the  objective  criteria  listed  below  in paragraph A2.3.8.2.2. A2.3.2.  The  subjective  prioritization  of  the  candidate  projects/tasks  will  be  conducted  by three  functional  groups  independently.  These  consist  of  a  TMS  Team  score,  a  MAJCOM score and scores from the Chief Engineers. A2.3.3.  Each functional group subjectively scores the candidate tasks, ranking each task on the  task  list  from  0-5  (5  being  the  highest  and  0  the  lowest).  To  provide  for  maximum discrimination, each group is asked to place an equal number of tasks within each rank (0 to 5). A2.3.3.1.  The TMS team will complete their subjective scoring first, then the scorecard with the TMS Team results will be forwarded to the appropriate MAJCOM lead for their scoring input. A2.3.3.2.  Once  the  MAJCOMs  have  completed  and  returned  their  scorings,  the  Chief Engineers will review the scoring to date and provide their scoring input. A2.3.3.3.  The  TMS  Program  Manager  is  responsible  for  the  timely  distribution  and collection of the scorecards to ensure all data is available for subsequent consideration in preparation for the ECWG. 88 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 A2.3.4.  This  section provides specific guidance  on the categorizing and  scoring of projects and tasks. The scoring criteria is presented in Table A2.1 and a scoring sample is provided in Table. A2.3.5.  At the completion of the engineering objective scoring and the functional scorings, as well as the non-scored project tasks, the CIP Branch Chief will compile all the scores and rankings and then present the results to the Director of Engineering (DOE) for review prior to proceeding to the EAB. A2.3.5.1.  As much as possible, combine non-separable items  into one project/task (e.g. include all costs of a given test into one scored project – test costs at Government facility, fuel, contractor support, etc). A2.3.5.2.  Do  not  lump  separable  items  into  one  all-encompassing  project/task  (e.g.,  do not put multiple tests into one large test task). As a general rule, if parts of a project or task would warrant different scores, they should be scored as separate projects or tasks. A2.3.6.  Non-scored projects/tasks: A2.3.6.1.  The following types of efforts constitute general program support and are not scored.  These  tasks  will  be  identified  on  the  task  scorecard  as  “PM”  (Program Management) type tasks. This is not to be confused with risk reduction efforts, which are program  content  (see  guidance  below).  The  use  of  these  categories  and  dollar  amounts will  be  absolutely  the  bare  minimum  required.  See  Chapter  8,  Engine  Health Indicators/Indicators Metrics, for summary definitions. A2.3.6.1.1.  “PM”:  (a)  Award  Fee  (if  applicable),  (b)  General  Product  Support  (not linked  to  a  scored  task),  (c)  MILSTRIP,  (d)  Minor  common  support  (e.g.,  test equipment and data management. A2.3.6.2.  The following types of risk reduction activities will not be scored. These tasks will be identified on task scorecard as “RR” (Risk Reduction) type tasks: A2.3.6.2.1.  “RR”:  (a)  LtF/ACI,  (b)  AMT  (w/o  task  validation  –  See  A3.3.7.  below for AMT w/task validation), (c) Mission analysis, (d) Parts life analysis. A2.3.7.  The TMS risk reduction efforts/plans will be presented at the ECWG meetings and then consolidated for the entire propulsion community for presentation/approval at the ELMP review.  Approved  elements  will  be  shown  above  the  cut  line  at  the  EAB;  non-approved elements  will  be  shown  below  the  cut  line.  Depending  upon  available  funding  and  other issues, items may be moved above/below the cut line at the EAB. A2.3.8.  Scored projects and tasks: A2.3.8.1.  Each distinct effort (project or task) will be scored relative to the TMS health status it is targeted to improve. Use the health metric that most justifies doing the project or  task  to  arrive  at  the  score  for  these  criteria.  If  more  than  one  targeted  metric  is currently rated “Yellow” or “Red,” use the metric resulting in the highest score justifying the  proposed  project  or  task.    DoP  health  metrics  are  defined  in  Chapter  8,  Engine Health Indicators. A2.3.8.2.  Tasks that are common across multiple TMSs are to be rated against the worst case health metric status for all the TMSs affected. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 89 A2.3.8.2.1.  Validation  tests  (including  AMTs  used  for  validation)  are  scored  the same  way  the  projects(s)/task(s)  being  validated  are  scored  -  use  the  highest applicable project or task score. A2.3.8.2.2.  Specific scorecard criteria are described below: A2.3.8.2.2.1.  Category  1,  Current  Health  Measure  Status.  Using  the  health measure  that  was  targeted  to  be  improved  by  implementing  the  project  or  task, assign the applicable score. Color rating of health metric is assigned according to criteria  defined  in  Chapter  5,  Engine  Health  Indicators.  Specific  goals  are documented in the ELMP for each engine program. A2.3.8.2.2.2.  Category  2,  Projected  Health  Measure  Status.  Using  the  projected status of the health measure that was targeted to be improved by the task, assign the  applicable  score.  The  projected  health  measure  status  should  look  five  years into  the  future  based  on  current  funded  implementation  efforts.  Do  not  include any benefits from the proposed new task list. Benefits from the proposed new CIP tasks will be accounted for on the applicable “TMS CIP Requirements Summary” slide. In specific instances where five years is an insufficient timeframe, a longer range  projection  can  be  recommended  –  annotate  any  instances  where  the  five-year  projection  is  not  used.  Color  rating  criteria  is  to  be  IAW  requirements defined in Chapter 8, Engine Health Indicators. Specific goals are documented in the ELMP for each engine program. A2.3.8.2.2.3.  Category 3, Safety Risk  Item.  If the CIP task has been initiated to address a red safety risk item, the task will earn points. An item is a red safety risk item  if  corrective  action  is  required  per  Table  8.1,  Chapter  8  Engine  Health Indicators. A2.3.8.2.2.4.  Category 4, Carry-Over/New Task. If the CIP task was initiated and funded  in  prior  year(s)  it  is  classified  as  a  carry-over.  If  the  task  is  new,  it  is considered a new start. A2.3.8.2.2.5.  Category 5, Technical Risk. If the proposed corrective action being proposed  has  been  designed  and  approved  for  use  on  other  USAF  systems,  the technical risk is less. The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) definitions are used to assign ratings per Table A2.3. A2.3.8.2.2.6.  Category 6, Benefits/Improvements. Each CIP task should be based on the customer’s request to improve one of the health metrics; however, since a task can affect more than one metric (e.g., Safety and WRE), this category allows tasks  to  earn  points  for  their  benefits  to  each  metric.  Tasks  can  score  points  for improvements  to  any  of  the  metrics  (a  maximum  of  5  points  total).  Consult  the Scoring Summary Table for specific score values/criteria for each metric. A2.3.8.2.2.7.  Category  7,  Implementation  Plan  Resources.    Points  for  this category  will  be  based  upon  the  status  of  implementation  resources.  Approved means that the required resources to implement the output product of the CIP task have  been  approved  by  the  Lead  MAJCOM  in  System  Requirement  Review Board  (SRRB)  (for  3400)  or  the  future  MAJCOM  POM  (for  3010).  Projected means  that  the  implementation  plan  has  been  developed  by  the  MPWG  and 90 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 included in the ELMP (3400), or is being submitted in the POM (3010). However, a projected status will not be shown indefinitely. Once a task has met the SRRB and/or  been  through  the  POM  process,  if  implementation  funding  has  not  been approved, it can no longer be considered as projected and will receive no points in this  category.  Upon  subsequent  re-submittal  and  approval,  it  would  then  be considered approved. A2.3.8.2.2.8.  Category  8,  TMS  Life  Remaining.  Each  CIP  task  will  earn  points based  on  the  TMS  length  of  life  remaining.  For  engine  models  with  multiple series of engines, use the series with the most years remaining to score all tasks, unless  the  task  is  applicable  to  only  one  series  that  has  fewer  years  of  life remaining. A2.3.8.2.2.9.  Category  9.  Multi-Engine  Benefits.  If  more  than  one  engine  TMS benefits from a CIP task, it can earn 2 to 5 extra points depending on the number of engine TMS’s it benefits.

The  Engine  CIP  is  a  sustainment  engineering  effort  intended  to  address  the long-term needs of the propulsion systems, through engine safety, reliability and maintainability enhancement  tasks  supported  through  yearly  contracts  with  the  engine  Original  Equipment Manufacturers  (OEM).  The  CIP  is  a  multi-faceted  program  that  combines  efforts  of  the  Life Cycle Management Center, Type Model Series (TMS) Engineering Function, Major Commands (MAJCOMs)  and  in  many  cases  the  US  Navy  and  International  partners  and  customers  who operate US made weapon systems. Based on the fact that the CIP is a cross service program with international participation, the roles/responsibilities along with critical processes must be defined and documented for consistence and equitable implementation based on benefits. A3.2.  Roles and Responsibilities. A3.2.1.  DoP: Provides the guidance on the Fair Share Rate computation process. A3.2.2.  AF  CIP  Program  Manager:  implements  the  Fair  Share  Rate  computation  guidance. Responsibilities include: A3.2.2.1.  Every  October,  solicit  the  active  engine  inventory  as  of  1  January  each  year from (Engine Sustainment Operations Office, International Engine Management Program (IEMP) office, and the Navy. A3.2.2.2.  Determine the final fair share rate using the contracted task amounts and active engine inventory as of 1 January of the execution year. Issue the final fair share letter to the IEMP office for funding. A3.2.3.  Engine Inventory Manager: Maintains USAF engine inventory data, both active and inactive and provides the data to AF CIP Program Manager upon request.  Source of data is CEMS. A3.2.4.  IEMP: Is an AF program, chartered to support the follow-on technical and logistical needs of participating international users through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process. This  support includes the management  of international  participation  in  the CIP program,  as governed  by  AFMAN  16-101,  International  Affairs  and  Security  Assistance  Management. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to: A3.2.4.1.  The  yearly  collection  and  documentation  of  international  engine  inventories, both  active  and  inactive.  The  IEMP  will  solicit  participating  members  in  October  to obtain  the  international  partner  inventory,  as  of  1  January  each  calendar  year.  These inventories will be provided to the AF CIP Program Manager. A3.2.4.2.  The  IEMP  will  maintain  line  management  authority  over  participating members  Letter  of  Offer  and  Acceptance  (LOA)  lines  for  CIP  participation.    After contract  award,  the  AF  CIP  Program  Manager  will  issue  the  final  fair  share  letter  to IEMP.  IEMP  will  provide  funding  through  the  AF  Form  616,  Fund  Cite  Authorization, process  within  45  days  of  receipt  of  the  fair  share  letter,  or  by  2  January,  whichever comes later. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 95 A3.2.4.3.  The  IEMP  will  participate  in  CIP  task  development  and  the  TMS  Team ranking  process.  Each  year  the  IEMP  will  solicit  international  users  for  potential  CIP tasks.  During  the  annual  CIP  TMS  engineering  meetings,  the  IEMP  will  attend  along with International partners and participate along with the AF TMS engineer in evaluating and determining CIP task benefits. A3.3.  Rules  of  Inventory  Participation.  Since the CIP is  a cost  share program,  with  funding requirements  being  determined  based  on  users  engine  inventory  count  as  of  1  January  each calendar year, it is important to understand that engines can and are maintained in various states. Dependent  upon  which  state  and  engine  is  classified  determines  if  that  engine  would  be considered for CIP fair share funding.  Rules for determining an engine status are listed below: A3.3.1.  Active  Engine  Inventory.  Active  engines  are  those  identified  as  being  active  for service within a user’s fleet.   Only  engines in  an  active status  receive CIP benefits  through the  incorporation  of  Engineering  Changes  (ECs)  developed  under  the  CIP  program.  Inventory of active engines as of 1 January will be used to compute the fair share rate for that year. A3.3.2.  Inactive Engine Inventory. Inactive engines are those engines that are not expected to  receive  EC  implementation  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  and  will  not  be  included  in  yearly inventory  counts  used  to  determine  the  CIP  fair  share  rates.    Examples  of  inactive  engines include: A3.3.2.1.  Destroyed engines/modules. A3.3.2.2.  Static engine/module displays. A3.3.2.3.  Engines/modules in non-recoverable storage. A3.3.2.4.  Engines/modules designated for long-term parts cannibalization. A3.3.2.5.  USAF engines stored at AMARG. A3.3.2.6.  International  engines  stored  in  an  AMARG-like  condition  (Refer  to  AFMAN 16-101 for additional guidance. A3.3.3.  Transfer  of  engines  from  active  to  inactive  inventory  and  vice  versa.  Based  on mission  requirements,  engines  can  be  moved  from  active  inventory  to  inactive  inventory during  the  year.  However,  active  inventory  at  the  beginning  of  each  calendar  year  will  be used  in  fair  share  computation.    Fair  shares  will  not  be  recomputed  during  the  year  for movement  of engines between active and inactive inventories or any other reasons,  such as changes in task costs during execution year. A3.3.4.  Equivalent  Engine.  When  a  new  series  is  created  off  of  a  TMS  for  some  minor configuration  changes,  the  new  series,  for  CIP  funding  purposes,  may  be  considered  as  a percentage  (say  85%)  equivalent  to  the  original  TMS  (determined  by  TMS  engineering  in coordination  with  IEMP).    The  percentage  equivalency  is  used  to  compute  an  equivalent inventory  for  the  new  series,  which  is  used  to  determine  the  CIP  contribution  amount.  For example: F110-132 series is 75% equivalent to F110-129 TMS and has an active inventory of 84.  F110-132  will  participate  in  the  fair  share  as  F110-129  with  F110-129  equivalent inventory of 63 (84 x 0.75) engines. 96 AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 A3.4.  Computation of Fair Share Rate.  The fair share rate of a TMS provides a common cost basis  for  computing  the  CIP  contribution  amount  of  each  participating  member  commensurate with its engine inventory for that TMS. Examples of cost pool, TMS Fair Share Rates and Fair Share Rate Computations can be found in Figure A3.1. A3.4.1.  Cost  Pool.  The  methodology  used  in  computing  fair  share  rates  follows  the accounting principles used in job costing.  CIP tasks are grouped in cost pools depending on TMS  or  group  of  TMSs  they  provide  benefits  to.    The  total  cost  of  a  cost  pool  is  equally allocated to the worldwide inventory of TMS or TMSs benefiting from that cost pool. Cost per engine in a pool = (Cost of all tasks in the pool) ÷ (Total number of engines of all TMSs in the pool). A3.4.2.  TMS  Fair  Share  Rate.  The  fair  share  rate  of  a  TMS  will  be  the  sum  of  per  engine cost of all cost pools in which the TMS is included.  If a TMS benefits from say three cost pools, its fair share rate will be the sum of per engine allocation from those three cost pools. TMS  Fair  Share  Rate  =  Sum  of  per  engine  cost  allocations  of  all  cost  pools  in  which  the TMS is included. A3.4.3.  Country Contribution Amount for a TMS. TMS Contribution Amount = (TMS Fair Share  Rate)  x  (Country’s  TMS  Active  Engine  Inventory)  as  of  1  January  of  CIP  calendar year. AFMAN 20-116  28 AUGUST 2017 97 Figure A3.1.
