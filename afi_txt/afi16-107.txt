Program Foundation. Military Personnel Exchange Programs between the USAF and the air forcesof a foreign nation are established under a formal international agreement.  The agreement sets generalconditions for the exchange program and, among other things, provides for the establishment, modifica-tion, and cancellation of individual exchange positions within the exchange program. 3.1.1.  DUSD(ISP) conducts Department of State consultation under Case Act (1 USC 112b(c)) inaccordance with DoD Directive 5530.3, International Agreements, June 11, 1987, with Change 1.   3.1.2.  USAF negotiations for exchange agreements will comply with DoDD 5230.20, its implement-ing instruction, and DoDD 5530.3, with Change 1.  SAF/IAPA drafts all USAF MPEP agreements andcoordinates them with the CONUS and Regional Program Management Offices, affected MAJCOMs,AF/XO, AF/DP, AF/SG, SAF/GCI, SAF/IA Country Directors, SAF/XC, DUSD(ISP), and theNational Guard Bureau as applicable.   3.2.  General Requirements. The MPEP operates with a one-for-one reciprocal exchange of US and for-eign personnel.  Each exchange places substantially equivalent, qualified personnel into similar positionsso both services benefit.  Foreign exchange personnel fill existing USAF Unit Manpower Document(UMD) positions.  Since the MPEP utilizes existing positions on USAF Unit Manpower Documents, theMPEP does not increase Air Force end strength. 3.3.  New Exchange Programs. The SECAF has re-delegated authority to develop, oversee, and executeinternational programs and activities affiliated with the Department of the Air Force to SAF/IA.  As partof these general responsibilities, SAF/IA has direct responsibility for the MPEP.   3.3.1.  Requests for New Exchange Program. USAF units requesting the establishment of a newexchange program and or positions must submit their proposal to the appropriate CONUS ProgramManagement Office.  The CONUS Program Management Office will forward the proposal to SAF/IAPA for coordination and final approval or disapproval. Any foreign unit requesting a new exchangeprogram must submit their proposal through their Air Chief.  The Air Chief either sends the request tothe CSAF, or submits it to SAF/IAPA, through their air attaché in Washington, DC, for coordinationand final approval or disapproval.  Include the following documents and information with the pro-posal:  3.3.1.1.  Position Description and Requisition Report (PDRR). PDRRs outline the position’sessential elements.  They must fully and clearly describe the duties, qualifications, minimum num-ber and type of accrued flight hours, mandatory certifications, training course requirements,required grade, security clearance, and experiences needed by the candidate in full detail, so theUSAF and foreign air force can identify the best-qualified candidate for the exchange position,and schedule required training.  PDRRs not submitted as outlined in Attachment 2 will bereturned.  3.3.1.2.  Justification for the Exchange. The justification must describe in detail why theexchange is being requested.  It should include, but is not limited to, the political-military benefitsthe exchange will bring to both air forces, how the exchange will enhance the air force-to-air forcerelationship, and the desired duration of the exchange. AFI16-107   2 FEBRUARY 2006113.3.1.3.  Suggested Reciprocal Position. Regardless of who requests establishment of theexchange, a suggested reciprocal position is required.  For example, Country X wants to enter intoan exchange of F-16 pilots but does not maintain F-16s in their inventory.  Country X would sug-gest a similar airframe with similar capabilities. 3.3.1.4.  Delegation of Disclosure Authority Letter (DDL): New or modified exchange positionpackages must include a DDL.  Governed by AFI 16-201, Air Force Foreign Disclosure and Tech-nology Transfer Program, the DDL identifies information, information systems, and networks towhich the exchange officer requires access in order to perform the duties outlined in the PDRR.The DDL is submitted at the time of the proposal.  Failure to submit a DDL could result in signif-icant delays in approving the proposal.  The host unit, in coordination with the applicable MAJ-COM Foreign Disclosure Office (FDO), will develop the DDL.  The MAJCOM FDO will forwardthe DDL to SAF/IAPA and SAF/IAPD via appropriate communication channels to determine fea-sibility of disclosure.  The foreign air force is not required to provide a DDL. 3.3.1.5.  Security Plan (SP). New or modified exchange position packages must include a Secu-rity Plan (reference Attachment 8 for a recommended format).  The SP provides written docu-mentation that appropriate access to USAF communication and computer systems, informationsystems, networks, enclaves, and work areas, as outlined in the proposed PDRR and DDL, havebeen approved by the USAF supervisor, the local Information Assurance Office, the Foreign Dis-closure Office, and the CONUS Program Management Office, and that all applicable requirementslisted in AFI 16-201 and AFI 33-202, Volume 1, Network and Computer Security have been metbefore the proposal is forwarded to the appropriate approval authority.  In short, the SP identifieshow the exchange personnel will gain access to work areas and information listed in the DDL.The foreign air force is not required to submit an SP.  The SP will: 3.3.1.5.1.  Identify the exchange position number, Unit Manpower Document (UMD) positionnumber, and organization of assignment. 3.3.1.5.2.  Identify the physical location of the individual’s work area and any other local orga-nizations the exchange officer will be required to visit during their tour. 3.3.1.5.3.  Identify the name, organizational address, and telephone number of the USAFsupervising official.  3.3.1.5.4.  Identify computers, communication systems, and other equipment the exchangeofficer is authorized to use along with any applicable conditions, user licensing requirements,restrictions, and or safeguards.   3.3.1.5.5.  Identify physical access requirements (e.g., escorted or unescorted access to thework area or any other areas, badge requirements, etc.) 3.3.1.5.6.  State that the exchange personnel will be instructed to identify himself as a memberof his parent service in all written, electronic and telephonic communications as referenced inAFI 33-202, Volume 1 and AFI 33-119, Air Force Messaging. 3.3.1.5.7.  List the actions US personnel will be responsible for taking to ensure that classifiedand controlled unclassified military information in their work areas or common work areaswill be controlled during the exchange tour.  3.3.1.5.8.  Identify how visitors will be informed about the existence of the exchange person-nel and the applicable disclosure and security requirements. 12AFI16-107   2 FEBRUARY 20063.3.1.5.9.  If applicable, state that contract employees tasked to provide training for exchangepersonnel have an approved and documented Technical Assistance Agreement (TAA). 3.3.1.5.10.  Identify the points of contact and applicable actions to be taken should securityplan violations occur. 3.3.1.6.  Site Surveys. Site surveys are essential to determining whether to approve the establish-ment of a position within the exchange program.  They are required prior to approving new posi-tions and should include unit sponsor information; identify whether the exchange officer will besubject to unit deployment; describe availability of housing, dependent schools, and medical facil-ities; outline force protection issues; and identify driver license and vehicle registration require-ments (reference Attachment 9).  If a site survey was previously accomplished at that location, anew site survey is not required, but the information must be validated.  This information should belisted in the Notes History section of the PDRR. 3.3.1.6.1.  Site Surveys for Exchange Positions Hosted by USAF Units. The  USAF  hostunit conducts site surveys in concert with the MAJCOM.  Site Surveys must ensure securityaccess (OPSEC, COMSEC, physical, etc.) is finalized and meets the requirements establishedin the PDRR and DDL.     3.3.1.6.2.  Site Surveys for Exchange Positions Hosted by Foreign Units. The  RegionalProgram Management Office will conduct a site survey and may request assistance from thelocal Air Force Office of Special Investigations Detachment or the U.S. Embassy’s RegionalSecurity Officer.   3.4.  Revalidating, Submitting Requisitions, and Selecting Personnel for Exchange Positions Hostedby Foreign Air Force Units. SAF/IAPA will transmit a revalidation requirement notification to theRegional Program Management Office based on the cumulative duration of a position's language andpre-employment training as it relates to the USAF assignment cycle timeline.   3.4.1.  Revalidation. Prior to requesting a replacement, the Regional Program Management Officewill contact the foreign air force to revalidate the PDRR (reference paragraph 3.3.1.1. for require-ments).  Revalidation is required for all positions even if there are no changes to the current PDRR.Because many nominees have not undergone language training prior to selection, they will berequired to take the Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB).  Therefore, the PDRR must includethe position’s required DLAB and Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) scores.  (ReferenceAttachment 11.)  If the position includes flying duties, the Regional Program Management Officewill request assistance from the servicing MAJCOM to assess flight safety.  Revalidation will be doc-umented with all appropriate signatures on the PDRR and submitted to SAF/IAPA for approval as out-lined in Attachment 2.   3.4.2.  Requisitions. Upon approval of the PDRR and in compliance with the AFPC assignment cycletimeline, the regional program management office will submit the PDRR to AFPC/DPASF (Officer)or AFPC/DPAAS4 (Enlisted), and courtesy copy SAF/IAPA.   3.4.3.  Selecting USAF Exchange Personnel. US Air Force personnel selected for exchange dutymust be able to successfully carry out their professional responsibilities and manage their personalaffairs in a highly visible and potentially stressful environment.  Based on the requirements listed inthe PDRR, AFPC will forward nominations to the Regional Program Management Office, with cour-tesy copy to SAF/IAPA.  The Regional Program Management Office will review the nominationAFI16-107   2 FEBRUARY 200613package and forward to the host unit for approval.  The Regional Program Management Office willnotify SAF/IAPA and AFPC or ANG/DP in writing of approval or disapproval, to include the nameand position of the host-country approving authority.  If approved AFPC will load the assignmentattaching USAF exchange personnel to the host unit and the member’s servicing Military PersonnelFlight will publish Permanent Change of Station orders.  If the nomination is disapproved, the hostunit will provide specific rationale and justification for the disapproval, and AFPC will forward amore qualified nomination.   3.5.  Revalidating, Submitting Requisitions, and Selecting Personnel for Exchange Positions Hostedby USAF Units. SAF/IAPA will transmit a revalidation requirement notification based on the cumulativeduration of a position's language and pre-employment training as it relates to the USAF assignment cycletimeline.     3.5.1.  Revalidation. CONUS Program Management Offices will request USAF host units revalidateexisting foreign exchange positions by updating the PDRR before personnel are replaced (referenceparagraph 3.3.1.1. for requirements).  Revalidation is required for all positions even if there are nochanges to the current PDRR.  Revalidation will be documented with all appropriate signatures on thePDRR (see Attachment 2).  The MAJCOM or Agency FDO, in coordination with the CONUS Pro-gram Management Office, will update the DDL (if required) and forward it along with the revalidatedPDRR and SP to SAF/IAPA and SAF/IAPD via appropriate communication channels for review andapproval.  SAF/IAPD, SAF/IAPA, and HQ USAF organizations with an interest in the position reviewthe documentation to ensure the position is current, and disclosure policy is consistent with the dutiesas described in the PDRR.  SAF/IAPA will send approved documentation to the CONUS ProgramManagement Office who will forward the documentation to the host unit commander/supervisor. 3.5.2.  Requisitions. Upon approval, SAF/IAPA will forward the revalidated PDRR to the parent ser-vice and notify them of replacement requirements. 3.5.3.  Selecting Foreign Exchange Personnel. Based on the requirements listed in the PDRR, theparent air force will forward nominations to SAF/IAPA, through their air attaché in Washington, DC.Nominations should include a career brief/Curriculum Vitae (CV) that outlines the officer's name,rank, service history, English language capabilities, level of security clearance, date the security clear-ance was granted, and date the security clearance will expire.  For flying positions, the nominationpackage should also include the individual’s flying hours, altitude chamber and centrifuge certifica-tions, and other special qualifications as applicable.  SAF/IAPA will review and forward replacementnomination packages to the applicable CONUS Program Management Office.  The CONUS ProgramManagement Office will review the nomination package and forward to the host unit for approval.The CONUS Program Management Office will notify SAF/IAPA in writing of approval or disap-proval.  If approved, SAF/IAPA will request that AFPC publish orders attaching foreign exchangepersonnel to the host unit.  Should the nomination be disapproved, the unit will provide specific ratio-nale and justification for the disapproval.   3.5.4.  Assigning Foreign Exchange Personnel. When the nomination package is approved, the par-ent government will submit an Extended Visit Authorization Request and security assurances throughthe parent government’s embassy in Washington, D.C. in accordance with DoDD 5230.20.  UponSAF/IAPA request, AFPC/DPASF will publish special orders.  These orders will identify theexchange officer by name; their service number (if applicable); parent service; exchange post numberand location; dates of assignment; dates and details of pre-employment training (if applicable and14AFI16-107   2 FEBRUARY 2006available); security clearance information, to include date granted and date of expiry; and privilegesgranted.  AFPC/DPASF will forward copies to the applicable CONUS Program Management Office,SAF/IAPA, parent government embassy, unit of assignment, and individual concerned.  These orders,in conjunction with the Extended Visit Authorization Request, authenticate exchange personnel secu-rity clearances and are the sole authority for travel of foreign exchange personnel to the United Statesfor the purpose of the exchange assignment.  Foreign exchange personnel will not initiate travel priorto receipt of these orders.  (This does not apply to non-MPEP travel such as International MilitaryEducation and Training, Professional Military Education exchanges, or other travel conducted underInvitational Travel Orders or the Extended Visit System.) 3.6.  Familiarization, Qualification, and Other Pre-employment Training. Exchange officers mustpossess the grade, skill, training, and academic qualifications described in the applicable PDRR.  The par-ent service will schedule and conduct training needed by the exchange officer to meet the listed manda-tory qualifications.  The host service will schedule and conduct familiarization, orientation, and otherpre-employment training listed in the PDRR as required training.   3.6.1.  When assigning USAF personnel to exchange positions, the applicable branch within theAFPC Assignments Division (AFPC/DPA) will assess the outbound individual's qualifications and, ifrequired, schedule appropriate training to ensure currency. 3.6.2.  If inbound foreign exchange personnel require operational transition or Mission QualificationTraining, the host unit and applicable training office of the gaining MAJCOM will assess the inboundindividual's qualifications, flying history, altitude chamber and centrifuge certifications (referenceAFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program, para 2.1.5.5. and AFI 11-404, CentrifugeTraining for High-G Aircrew, para 1.2.), and English language skills in relation to the applicablePDRR, develop an appropriate training plan, and coordinate with the applicable branch in AFPC/DPAto obtain any required training quotas. 3.7.  Language Requirements. Personnel selected for exchange duty must speak the host language flu-ently, or receive enough language training to speak with a minimum level of professional proficiency asidentified in the PDRR.   3.7.1.  Language Training for Foreign Exchange Personnel. Unless English is the parent country’sprimary language (e.g., Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom), nomination packages mustinclude the nominee’s English Comprehension Level (ECL) and Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI) testscores.   3.7.1.1.  ECL. The ECL test is a four-option, multiple-choice test of listening and reading com-prehension which is used to assess the English language proficiency of international military stu-dents being considered for assignment or training in the United States.  The emphasis is oninformal American English, the kind of language that might be used in a military training environ-ment.  ECL scores are valid for 105 calendar days. 3.7.1.2.  OPI. An OPI is a test of a candidate's English language listening comprehension andspeaking ability, conducted under controlled conditions by two certified OPI raters.  Candidatesare rated on an 11-point scale, ranging from "0" (no functional proficiency) to "5" (educatednative-speaker proficiency), with plus levels (0+, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+) assigned to candidates who dem-onstrate inconsistent proficiency at the next higher base level.  The appraisal factors considered atAFI16-107   2 FEBRUARY 200615each level (though not equally weighted) are vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, fluency, lin-guistic tasks, and socio-linguistic/cultural awareness.  OPI ratings are valid for six months. 3.7.1.3.  Required Scores. Foreign personnel filling exchange positions as pilots, instructors,doctors, and lawyers must score at least 85 out of 100 on the ECL and at least 2+/2+ on the OPI.Nominees who have not achieved the required test scores but are otherwise qualified for theexchange position will be scheduled to attend the 16-week Advanced English Language Program.In addition, unless English is the parent country’s primary language, all pilot nominees arerequired to attend the nine-week Specialized English Training Course (SET) regardless of ECL/OPI scores.  The SET course focuses on building language skills and terminology associated withtechnical training.  Foreign personnel filling all other exchange positions must score at least 80 outof 100 on the ECL and at least 2/2 on the OPI.  Nominees who have not achieved the required testscores but are otherwise qualified for the exchange position will be scheduled to attend the12-week Language Proficiency Skills course.  If, upon completion of language training, the nom-inee still hasn’t achieved the required test scores, the Defense Language Institute English Lan-guage Center will notify SAF/IAPA of the circumstances surrounding the individual’sperformance.  SAF/IAPA will notify the host unit, through the CONUS Program ManagementOffice, and if circumstances warrant, query if they are willing to accept the nominee’s test scores.If the host unit agrees, SAF/IAPA may grant a test score waiver.   3.7.2.  Language Training for USAF Exchange Personnel. Unless English is the host country’s pri-mary language (e.g., Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom), nomination packages must includethe nominee’s Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) and or Defense Language Aptitude Battery(DLAB) scores.  Neither AFPC nor the Regional Program Management Office should forward nomi-nations without a valid DLPT or DLAB score.  If the individual does not meet the language profi-ciency (DLPT) requirements outlined in the PDRR, but achieves the required language aptitude(DLAB) score, they will be scheduled for foreign language training.  Reference Attachment 11 forrequired DLAB scores, DLPT scores, and language training course length.   3.7.2.1.  Language Training for Spouses of USAF Exchange Personnel. Spouses  may  alsoreceive MPEP-funded language training.  If the sponsor is scheduled for foreign language trainingat the Defense Language Institute, the spouse may audit the course on a space available basis.  Ifspace is not available, or other constraints apply, the spouse may attend a publicly available certi-fied language course or obtain a professional tutor, subject to authorization by the applicableRegional Program Management Office. 3.8.  Tour Length. Unless otherwise specified in the MPEP Memorandum of Agreement/Understanding(MOA/U), exchange tours are two years, plus travel and training time. 3.8.1.  Tour adjustment of USAF exchange personnel. Regional Program Management Officeswill request approval for minor adjustments to tour length (e.g., to coincide with a PCS port call) fromHQ AFPC/DPASF or ANG/DP as appropriate, with an info copy to SAF/IAPA.  HQ AFPC/DPASFwill provide approval or disapproval to the regional program management office with info copy toSAF/IAPA.  For longer extensions, the Regional Program Management Office must also gain hostcountry and SAF/IAPA approval.  Extension of tours beyond one year will not be considered, andrequests for tours beyond 36 months will not normally be approved.  The Regional Program Manage-ment Office must complete the tour adjustment request before submitting a replacement requisition.   16AFI16-107   2 FEBRUARY 20063.8.2.  Adjusting tours of foreign exchange personnel. Foreign exchange personnel who desire touradjustments must have the approval of their parent service.  Host unit commanders of foreignexchange personnel will send a written request with justification for tour adjustment to the CONUSProgram Management Office. The CONUS Program Management Office will endorse the request foradjustment and forward it to SAF/IAPA.  SAF/IAPA will coordinate the request with the air attach ofthe parent service and advise the CONUS Program Management Office of approval or disapproval.  Ifthe parent nation approves the adjustment, SAF/IAPA will request HQ AFPC/DPASF publish amend-ments to orders.  Once the amendments are published, SAF/IAPA will provide copies to all interestedparties.  3.9.  Modifying and Adding Positions. Modifying and adding positions to a pre-existing internationalagreement will be conducted in the same manner as outlined in paragraph 3.3.1. 3.10.  Deleting Positions. In accordance with the existing international agreement, either party canrequest that a position be deleted when it is determined that the position no longer serves the purpose forwhich it was established.  USAF units hosting an exchange position will submit formal requests for dele-tion to the appropriate CONUS Program Management Office.  The CONUS Program Management Officewill forward requests to SAF/IAPA.  Foreign units hosting an exchange position will notify their Air Staffof a decision or desire to delete an existing position.  The foreign air staff will submit a proposal of dele-tion to SAF/IA, through their air attach in Washington, DC.  SAF/IA will forward the request to SAF/IAPA.  Upon receipt, SAF/IAPA will staff the request through the appropriate USAF agencies that have avested interest in that particular exchange.  If the decision is made to delete the position, exchange person-nel currently serving in the affected billets should be permitted to fulfill their tours unless otherwiseagreed by the host and the parent nation.   AFI16-107   2 FEBRUARY 200617Chapter 4   ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL RESTRICTIONS 4.1.  Duty Positions of Exchange Personnel. Host services identify duty positions for foreign exchangepersonnel, and exchange personnel normally fill positions with responsibilities equal to their grade andqualifications.  Exchange personnel perform their duties: 4.1.1.  Under the parent government’s administrative control. 4.1.2.  Under the host government’s operational control. 4.2.  Legal Restrictions.

They may not perform duties on behalf of the parent govern-ment during their tour.  If operational requirements dictate that the parent government must utilizetheir exchange personnel to perform parent country tasks, they must first gain host governmentapproval to temporarily remove and reassign the affected personnel from their exchange tour.  Ifapproved, exchange personnel will normally be required to extend their tour to fulfill their assignmentobligations unless otherwise agreed by the host and the parent nation.   4.2.1.1.  U.S. organizations wishing to utilize USAF exchange personnel to perform parent coun-try tasks will submit formal requests to the appropriate Regional Program Management Officeoutlining the purpose, duration, and rationale for reassigning the affected personnel from theirexchange tour.  The Regional Program Management Office will forward requests to SAF/IAPA.SAF/IAPA will coordinate the request with the foreign air attach in Washington, DC.   4.2.1.2.  Foreign organizations wishing to utilize their exchange personnel to perform parent coun-try tasks will submit formal requests to SAF/IAPA, through their air attach in Washington, DC.Upon receipt, SAF/IAPA will coordinate the request through the appropriate USAF agencies thathave a vested interest in that particular exchange.   4.2.2.

All disclosures and releases of military information andmateriel to foreign nationals resulting from international affairs and security assistance activities must beauthorized in accordance with AFPD 16-2, Operations Support, Disclosure of Military Information toForeign Governments and International Organizations and AFI 16-201.  To avoid creating false impres-sions of U.S. intent or potentially disclosing classified or controlled unclassified information, USAFexchange officers will not use or provide any US government information without prior approval fromtheir servicing Foreign Disclosure Office. 4.4.1.  USAF personnel will disclose CMI or CUMI to foreign exchange officers only when they pos-sess the appropriate security clearance and have a need-to-know based on their positional duties.USAF special orders assigning foreign exchange personnel to USAF units identifies the securityclearance granted by the officer’s parent government and formally recognizes the technical eligibilityof foreign exchange personnel to access U.S. CMI and CUMI as specified in the DDL.  Commandersor supervisors of foreign exchange personnel permit access to CMI and CUMI in accordance with theDDL and only to the extent necessary for exchange personnel to perform their duties. 4.4.2.  Commanders, supervisors, and co-workers of foreign exchange personnel must be thoroughlyfamiliar with the DDL.   4.4.3.  Exceptions to approved DDLs are processed through MAJCOM/Agency FDOs in accordancewith existing disclosure procedures, and require SAF/IAPD approval. 4.4.4.  Foreign exchange personnel may be granted access to and use of appropriate information sys-tems (consistent with the requirements of AFI 33-202 Volume 1, Network and Computer Security) aslisted in the DDL, but not access to information listed below without prior SAF/IAPD approval: 4.4.4.1.

Information that could help build an independent, strategic, national nuclear capabilitywith nuclear devices and weapons, or strategic weapons launch or delivery vehicles. 4.5.  Foreign Exchange Personnel Visits. The U.S. installation commander or organization mustapprove visits of foreign exchange personnel. 4.5.1.  U.S. supervisors of foreign exchange personnel must obtain U.S. installation commander ororganization approval if an exchange of military information is expected during a visit (e.g., when for-eign exchange personnel attend meetings, briefings, planning conferences, etc.).  Supervisors mustadvise the installation or activity commander, or contractor facility director of the foreign disclosurelimitations before the visit.  If a visit to a U.S. installation is not expected to result in an exchange ofmilitary information (e.g., cross-country flights, competitive sporting events, open house activities,etc.), then disclosure limitations need not be forwarded.  In all cases, however, the unit to be visitedmust be informed that the individual is a foreign exchange person.  Foreign exchange personnel willperform the visit on official TDY orders and not on Invitational Travel Orders. 4.5.2.  Foreign exchange personnel may not perform TDY in a third country without approval of theparent service and prior clearance.

Ground and or Airborne Alert Duty. Participating in armed ground or airborne alert duty couldplace U.S. and foreign exchange officers in situations involving active or imminent hostilities or mayjeopardize the interests of either the parent or host government.  Therefore, unless both the parent and hostgovernments provide prior approval, U.S. and foreign exchange personnel may perform armed alert dutyonly in units under the operational control of a combined command [e.g., North American AerospaceDefense Command (NORAD), or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)] to which the both theparent and host governments belong.  In the case of NORAD, the NORAD Commander, with the concur-rence of the parent service, must approve alert duty.     4.8.  Dress and Appearance. USAF exchange personnel will comply with guidance contained in AFI36-2903, Dress and Appearance of Air Force Personnel.  Consistent with the intent of U.S. laws, theLaws of Armed Conflict, and the Geneva Conventions, exchange personnel must, at all times, retain theiridentity and status as members of their parent military service.
