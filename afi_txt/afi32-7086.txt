SUMMARY OF CHANGES This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.  This revision updates and replaces AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Material Management, 1 Nov 2004, in its entirety.  This revised  AFI  connects  the  Hazardous  Materials  Management  Process  (HMMP)  to  the  AF Environmental  Management  System  (EMS).    It  introduces  “HAZMAT  Tracking  Activity (HTA)” terminology to describe key aspects of the “HAZMART” function. It corrects references to  laws  and  regulations,  and  clarifies  the  definition  of  HAZMAT  at  paragraph  1.4.    HMMP functional  responsibilities  are  streamlined,  but  remain  largely  the  same  with  an  emphasis  on collaboration.    This  AFI  also  eliminates  the  mandatory  requirement  for  Major  Command (MAJCOM)  HMMP  teams.    A  section  has  been  added  on  HAZMAT  management  policy  and guidance linkages to address Air Force Audit Agency findings.  This revision complies with AFI 33-360  waiver  tier  requirements  described  above  and  incorporates  revised  roles  and responsibilities  based  on  Program  Action  Directive  (PAD)  12-03,  Enterprise-Wide  Civil Engineer Transformation, and associated Programing Plan (P-Plan).  AF-specific policy remains in this AFI, however, additional and more detailed information can be found in the non-directive process  HAZMAT  management  playbook  published  on  the  AF  Civil  Engineer  (CE)  Portal: https://app.eis.af.mil/a7cportal/Pages/default.aspx.

HMMP Scope.  HAZMAT management responsibilities are distributed across the core AF functions  of  Acquisition,  Logistics  Readiness  (Materiel  Management),  Maintenance,  CE, Surgeon  General  (SG)  (Bioenvironmental  Engineering  or  BE),  Safety  (SE),  and  Contracting.  Each  of  these  functions  remains  responsible  for  its  inherent  HAZMAT  management  policies, standards,  and  procedures  (see  “Linkages,”  paragraph  1.7.).    The  HMMP  coordinates  these distributed  functional  activities  and  responsibilities  to  enable  effective  AF  enterprise-wide HAZMAT  management  and  oversight.    To  existing  functional  HAZMAT  policies  and procedures,  the  HMMP  also  adds  specific  cross-functional  HMMP  teaming,  HAZMAT authorization,  HAZMAT tracking,  and  ozone  depleting  substance  (ODS)  management requirements. 1.2.  HMMP  Purpose.  The  HMMP  is  an  essential  element  of  the  AF  EMS,  established  in response to  the requirements  of EO 13423 (see  AFI 32-7001, Environmental Management).   It coordinates  and  integrates  the  AF  activities  and  infrastructure  required  for  the  ongoing identification, authorization and tracking of HAZMAT. The purpose of the HMMP is to facilitate the management of the procurement and use of HAZMAT to: (1) support Air Force missions; (2) protect  the  safety  and  health  of  personnel  on  Air  Force  installations  and  communities surrounding Air Force installations by ensuring proper authorization of HAZMAT; (3) minimize Air  Force  use  of  HAZMAT  consistent  with  mission  requirements;  and  (4)  maintain  Air  Force compliance with environmental requirements for HAZMAT usage. 1.3.  HMMP Objectives. 1.3.1.  The  HMMP  accomplishes  these  purposes  by  coordinating  the  effective  management and minimization of AF  dependence on HAZMAT within acceptable levels  of mission and ESOH risk, while reducing associated total ownership cost. 1.3.2.  The specific objectives of the HMMP are to: 1.3.2.1.  Establish  a  collaborative  framework  for  collecting  and  maintaining  HAZMAT data  on  the  standardized  Air  Force  HAZMAT  tracking  system.    The  Enterprise Environment,  Safety,  and  Occupational  Health  Management  Information  System (EESOH-MIS)  is  the  standardized  Air  Force  HAZMAT  and  hazardous  waste  tracking system. 1.3.2.2.  Support  compliance  with  applicable  HAZMAT  management  laws,  regulations and EOs, especially EO 13423 and EO 13514, which require federal agencies to comply with  Emergency  Planning  and  Community  Right-to-Know  Act  (EPCRA)  sections  (§§) 301-313 and to minimize the use of HAZMAT.  Support compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) and Air Force EPCRA implementing guidance. 1.3.2.3.  Provide  a  key  part  of  the  installation’s  Waste  Minimization  Program  to  meet Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) requirements. AFI32-7086  4 FEBRUARY 2015   5  1.3.2.4.  Serve  as  a  key  information  resource  allowing  the  AF  EMS  at  all  levels  to develop  plans,  establish  aspect  inventories,  identify  impacts,  set  objectives  and  targets, and monitor implementation of corrective actions. 1.3.2.5.  Support  the  work  area  supervisor  with  information  necessary  to  facilitate compliance  with  applicable  hazardous  material  risk  communication  requirements, especially the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  (OSHA)  Hazard Communication  (HAZCOM)  Standard  (29  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  [CFR] 1910.1200). 1.3.2.6.  Support  all  functional  areas  involved  in  HAZMAT  management  with  data  on HAZMAT usage and location. 1.4.  HAZMAT Definition and Exceptions. 1.4.1.  For purposes of this AFI, the term HAZMAT includes all items that are: 1.4.1.1.  Covered  under  EPCRA  or  other  applicable  host  nation,  federal,  state,  or  local tracking or reporting requirements; 1.4.1.2.  Covered  under  the  OSHA  HAZCOM  Standard  (29  CFR  1910.1200)  or  the OSHA  Occupational  Exposure  to  Hazardous  Chemicals  in  Laboratories  Standard  (29 CFR 1910.1450); 1.4.1.3.  Class I or Class II ODS. 1.4.2.  Exceptions.  The term HAZMAT, as used in this AFI, excludes: Munitions, as defined by AFI 21-200, Munitions and Missile Maintenance Management; pharmaceuticals managed by  an  installation  pharmacy  or  formulary;  radioactive  materials  (RAM),  as  defined  in  and managed IAW AFI 40-201, Radioactive Materials Management; and Hazardous Waste. 1.5.  HMMP Teams.  At HAF and installation levels, Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health  Councils  (ESOHC)  must  establish  cross-functional  HMMP  teams  to  coordinate  the inherent functional HAZMAT management responsibilities and to oversee the implementation of the specific additional requirements in this AFI. 1.5.1.  HMMP Team Chain of Command. At HAF and installation levels, the Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health Council (ESOHC) chair will establish, via formal charter, a cross-functional  HMMP  team.  CE  will  lead  the  HMMP  team.  The  team  will  report  to  the ESOHC  chair,  except  for  the  HAF  HMMP  team,  which  will  report  to  the  HAF  ESOHC Steering  Committee.  Individual  team  members  are  also  responsible  for  reporting  to  their functional  chain  of  command  on  HMMP  issues.  Geographically  Separated  Units  may  be supported  by  the  supporting  installation  HMMP.    Although  HMMP  teams  will  not  be required  at  the  MAJCOM-level,  MAJCOM  ESOHCs  should  consider  reauthorizing MAJCOM  HMMP  teams,  as  a  best  practice.    In  the  absence  of  MAJCOM  HMMP  teams, individual MAJCOM functionals  will assist  their counterparts on installation  HMMP teams with  policy,  resource  advocacy,  and  conflict  resolution.    The  Air  Force  Civil  Engineering Center, Environmental Directorate (AFCEC/CZ) will provide installation CE environmental functional oversight. 1.5.2.  HMMP  Team  Composition.  The  HMMP  team  will  include,  but  is  not  limited  to, representatives from CE (representing Environmental and Fire Emergency Services), SG, SE, Legal  (JA),  Maintenance,  Logistics  Readiness  (Material  Management  and  Traffic   6  AFI32-7086  4 FEBRUARY 2015 Management),  Contracting,  and  HAZMART  supervisors.  Other  functional  areas  such  as Finance, Requirements, Plans, Manpower, Public Affairs, HAZMAT users, Communications and Information, and tenant organizations are also members of the HMMP team, as required. Contracted  functions  may  have  contractor  representation  on  the  HMMP  team.  The  team charter will specifically identify HMMP team members and document frequency of meetings decided. 1.5.3.  HMMP  Team  Training.    Ensure  HMMP  team  personnel  obtain  and  document applicable  HAZMAT  training  requirements  IAW  AFOSH,  OSHA,  other  applicable environmental standards, and local requirements. HAZMART supervisors and HMMP team members should use the Air  Force  Institute of Technology (AFIT) Civil  Engineer School’s HMMP  Course  (WENV-222)  as  the  primary  source  of  HMMP  training.    See  the  HMMP program page on the eDASH SharePoint site (https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/edash/) for a listing of  HAZMAT  training  and  training  sources.  Also,  HMMP  team  members  will  be  familiar with both EESOH-MIS and the self-inspection checklists. 1.6.  HAZMAT Tracking Activity (HTA).  Any unit that uses HAZMAT must be supported by an HTA, where inventory receipt and issue data are captured into EESOH-MIS.  This AFI uses the term “HAZMART” to describe the location, organization, or function that performs the HTA requirement. 1.7.  AF  HAZMAT  Guidance  Linkages.  This  AFI  is  not  the  governing  document  for  all aspects of AF HAZMAT management.  It is a cross-functional, coordinating directive guidance document  that  connects  functional  AF  HAZMAT  management  policies,  standards,  and procedures  and  that  supplements  those  documents  with  additional  directive  guidance  on  the authorization and tracking of HAZMAT.   The key  authoritative sources of functional  guidance that should be used in conjunction with this AFI include: 1.7.1.

At the installation-level, the standard Air Force HMMP functions as a partially decentralized  operation.  The  installation  ESOHC  chair  charters  the  HMMP  team  to  provide oversight  and  coordination  of  the  HMMP.  At  an  installation,  the  standard  Air  Force  HMMP consists of the following elements, covered in this chapter: 3.1.1.  HAZMART.    A  HAZMART  is  an  HTA  where  inventory  receipt  and  issue  data  are captured in EESOH-MIS. 3.1.2.  HAZMAT Monitoring Process.  This process, described in paragraph 3.3., establishes the  standardized  installation  procedures  for  ensuring  that  all  HAZMAT  (as  defined  in  this AFI)  used  by  government  and  contractor  organizations  on  an  installation  is  channeled  into the HMMP for authorization and tracking. 3.1.3.  HAZMAT  Determination  and  Authorization  Process.  This  process,  described  in paragraph  3.4.,  establishes  the  standardized  procedures  for  requesting,  authorizing,  and tracking HAZMAT used on an installation by either government or contractor organizations. 3.1.4.  EESOH-MIS.  EESOH-MIS  is  the  standard  AF  HAZMAT  tracking  system  used  by installation personnel to request, authorize, and track HAZMAT. 3.1.5.  Special  Installation-level  HMMP  Considerations.  Installation  personnel  implement special  HAZMAT  planning,  identification,  tracking,  authorization,  and  management measures  for  ODS  and  for  deployments.    Functional  HMMP  team  members  ensure  their HMMP responsibilities, where appropriate, are included in contracts when they outsource or privatize  their  functions.    HMMP  teams  also  establish  procedures  to  ensure  the  HMMP supports  AF  EMS  continual  improvement  activities.    Team  members  participate  in  the installation EMS cross-functional team IAW AFI 32-7001. 3.2.  HAZMART.  A  HAZMART  is  the  only  entity  on  an  installation  authorized  to  issue government-owned  HAZMAT  from  any  source  (e.g.  GPC,  AF  Form  9,  or  any  DoD  standard supply  system).  Each  installation  must  have  at  least  one  HAZMART  established  by,  and accountable  to,  the  Logistics  Readiness  Squadron  (LRS)  commander  or  equivalent.  (T-1).  In addition,  HAZMARTs  can  be  established  within  other  organizations  to  facilitate  HAZMAT tracking across the installation. However, those installations, such as Geographically Separated Units, that are supported by another location are not required to have a separate HAZMART. All HAZMARTs (whether contractor or government operated) shall: 3.2.1.  Track the receipt and issue of HAZMAT in EESOH-MIS. (T-1). 3.2.2.  Record  the  receipt  of  HAZMAT  against  the  correct  SDS  in  EESOH-MIS.    Forward SDSs  not  already  loaded  into  EESOH-MIS  to  the  installation  HMMP-identified  SDS gatekeeper. (T-1). 3.2.3.  Ensure that all requests for HAZMAT have an authorization prior to issue. (T-1). 3.2.4.  Immediately forward to the HMMP team information on any requested material that is not  currently  loaded  in  EESOH-MIS  and  that  is  potentially  hazardous.  (T-1).  The  HMMP team determines whether the material meets the HAZMAT definition in paragraph 1.4.   18  AFI32-7086  4 FEBRUARY 2015 3.2.5.  Minimize  HAZMAT  usage  or  waste  by  reusing/redistributing  excess  HAZMAT through Free-issue programs, or through the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Reutilization, Transfer, Donation, and Sales program. Before ordering or purchasing HAZMAT, determine if  it  is  possible  to  obtain  the  HAZMAT  from  the  installation  free-issue,  reuse,  and redistribution program, as the preferred HAZMAT source. (T-2). 3.2.6.  Perform the following minimum issue and turn-in services for out-of-production Class I ODS. (T-1).  More detailed guidance can be found in the non-directive process HAZMAT management playbook published on the AF CE Portal. 3.2.6.1.  Forward  to  the  MAJCOM  A4  Halon  focal  point  for  special  approval  Halon requisition requests that surpass the quantity threshold in paragraph 3.6.1.1.5. 3.2.6.2.  Assist  units  with  the  supply  procedures  needed  to  turn-in  excess  and unserviceable Class I ODS to the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve. 3.2.7.  Assist users in identifying HAZMAT stock numbers and/or part numbers, and finding appropriate SDSs. (T-2). 3.2.8.  Comply with HMMP Team-developed procedures as applicable. (T-2) 3.3.  HAZMAT  Monitoring  Process.  The  HMMP  Team  shall  establish  local  procedures  to ensure  that  materiel  brought  onto  the  installation,  regardless  of  payment  method  (e.g.;  SBSS; GPC; AF Form 9 etc.) or user (e.g. government or contractor) is evaluated to determine whether it is a HAZMAT and therefore must be authorized and tracked. (T-1). 3.3.1.  The non-directive process HAZMAT management playbook published on the AF CE Portal contains guidance and templates for accomplishing installation HAZMAT monitoring.  Supply  materiel  monitoring  procedures  below  are  consistent  with  the  LRS  procedures  in AFMAN 23-122, but apply to all installation supply locations. 3.3.2.  Local  materiel  monitoring  procedures  shall  incorporate  the  following  minimum requirements (T-1): 3.3.2.1.  Unless the requestor is already authorized to use the material in EESOH-MIS or the  material  has  been  specifically  exempted  from  authorization  and  tracking  by  the installation HMMP team, any installation supply location that receives a customer request for a materiel item that meets any of the following criteria shall redirect the customer to submit  the  request  for  HAZMAT  determination  and  authorization  IAW  the  procedures established under paragraph 3.5. 3.3.2.1.1.  The item has an NSN with an IEX Code of 9. 3.3.2.1.2.  The item has an NSN with a Hazardous Characteristic Code. 3.3.2.1.3.  The item falls within a Federal Supply Class listed in Federal Standard 313 (FED-STD-313),  Material  Safety  Data,  Transportation  Data  and  Disposal  Data  for Hazardous Materials Furnished to Government Activities. 3.3.2.1.4.  The item meets other installation-established criteria. AFI32-7086  4 FEBRUARY 2015   19  3.3.2.2.  If  a  contract  is  reasonably  expected  to  require  a  contractor  to  bring  or  to  use HAZMAT on an installation, the requiring activity working with the Contracting Office shall include the following contract requirements to ensure that contractor materials can be evaluated for authorization and tracking under the HMMP. 3.3.2.2.1.  Federal  Acquisition  Regulation  (FAR)  Clause  52.223-3,  Hazardous Material Identification and Material Safety Data. 3.3.2.2.2.  FAR  Clause  52.223-5,  Pollution  Prevention  and  Right-to-Know Information. 3.3.2.2.3.  FAR  Clause  52.223-19,  Compliance  with  Environmental  Management Systems. 3.3.2.2.4.  AFFARS  Clause  5352.223-9001,  Health  and  Safety  on  Government Installations. 3.3.2.2.5.  FAR Clause 52.223-7, Notice of Radioactive Materials. 3.3.2.2.6.  The locally developed HAZMAT tracking and reporting tasks necessary to ensure contractor compliance with this AFI. 3.3.2.3.  Installation  HMMP  teams  must  develop  local  procedures  to  ensure  that  the HAZMAT  monitoring  process  does  not  impede  time-critical  mission-essential  materiel requests. 3.4.  HAZMAT Determination and Authorization Process. 3.4.1.  All HAZMAT brought onto an installation for use shall be authorized via the process described in this section (T-1). Note that HAZMARTs do not require separate authorizations to  perform  the  supply  functions  of  ordering,  receiving,  stocking,  and  storing  HAZMAT. Support  agreements  may  specifically  delegate  CE,  SE,  and/or  BE  authorization responsibilities to the tenant. Even if the base delegates CE authorization authority to a tenant unit,  the  tenant  unit  must  still  notify  the  base  CE  of  all  HAZMAT  requests  before  final authorization. (T-1). 3.4.2.  Work area supervisors shall use EESOH-MIS to initiate a request for HAZMAT. This action  is  only  required  for  the  first  time  use  of  a  HAZMAT  in  a  Work  Area;  to  submit revisions to an existing authorization because of changes to the process, requiring document, procedures,  HAZMAT;  and  for  use  of  the  HAZMAT  in  a  different  process.  Work  area supervisors  must  notify  the  HMMP  Team  of  any  changes  to  the  information  on  an authorization. (T-1). 3.4.3.  For  any  requested  material  that  is  not  currently  loaded  in  EESOH-MIS,  the  HMMP team will determine whether it meets the HAZMAT definition in paragraph 1.4. (T-1). 3.4.4.  The Authorizing Offices (CE, SE, and BE), operating on behalf of the HMMP team, shall  require  the  use  of  the  least  hazardous  available  material  to  the  reasonable  extent possible (T-1). For HAZMATs that drive a significant aspect or impact, every effort must be made to find an alternative and if required by TO, a candidate process will be submitted (see playbook for the candidate process instructions).   20  AFI32-7086  4 FEBRUARY 2015 3.4.5.  Each  of  the  Authorizing  Offices  (CE,  SE,  and  BE)  shall  make  an  independent determination  of  whether  to  authorize  the  process  and  HAZMAT  use  as  specified  by  the requestor, authorize with additional restrictions, or not authorize the request. (T-1). 3.4.5.1.  If  one  of  the  Authorizing  Offices  does  not  approve  the  authorization,  then  the request is denied. 3.4.5.2.  Authorizing  Offices  can  choose  to  blanket  authorize  a  HAZMAT,  allowing future authorization requests for that material to be automatically be proxy-authorized by the tracking system for that specific Authorizing Office.  Transactions for these materials will still be tracked in EESOH-MIS. 3.4.5.3.  Authorizing Offices can also choose to exempt a HAZMAT from all tracking on an installation.  To be exempt, all the Authorizing offices must unanimously exempt the material from tracking.  Note: If one (or more) of the Authorizing Offices chooses to not exempt a proposed material,  the Authorizing  Offices that prefer exemption  may instead choose to blanket authorize the material.  This allows lower-risk materials to be tracked on  the  installation  for  one  of  the  Authorizing  Offices  without  adversely  impacting  the review workload of all of the Authorizing Offices. 3.4.5.4.  In  the  case  of  requests  by  a  contractor,  the  CE  authorization  is  for Environmental, Fire Emergency Services, and emergency response purposes only  (T-1). The  SE  and  BE  reviews  are  “for  information  purposes  only”,  and  do  not  involve evaluation  and  approval  of  the  contractor’s  safety  and  health  programs.  The  purpose  of the SE and BE review is to identify potential risks to government personnel and resources and  advise  CE  and  the  Contracting  Office  on  how  to  mitigate  identified  hazards  from planned contractor HAZMAT usage. 3.4.6.  Once all Authorizing Offices approve an authorization, the requestor can proceed with procurement through its servicing HAZMART. 3.4.7.  The requestor must comply with all restrictions specified by the Authorizing Offices. (T-1). 3.5.  EESOH-MIS.  Installation  HAZMAT  users,  HMMP  teams,  ESOH  functionals,  and  other installation personnel shall use EESOH-MIS to request, authorize, and track HAZMAT. (T-1). 3.5.1.  If  EESOH-MIS  is  not  available,  installations  may  use  the  AF  Form  3952  to accomplish HAZMAT requests and authorizations.   However, information from paper forms must  be  entered  into  EESOH-MIS  to  support  continued  tracking,  authorization,  and reporting. 3.5.2.  HMMP  team  shall  implement  a  management  effort  to  provide  for  the  quality assurance  of  the  EESOH-MIS  data  upon  which  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the HMMP depend. (T-1). 3.6.  Additional Installation-level HAZMAT Management Considerations. 3.6.1.  Ozone  Depleting  Substances  (ODS).    Under  international  agreements  and  Federal Law, Class I ODSs have been out-of-production in the U.S since 1995.  Class II ODS will be completely  phased-out  of  production  between  2020  and  2030.    The  non-directive  process HAZMAT  management  playbook  published  on  the  AF  CE  Portal  contains  a  list  of  ODS materials and additional installation-level ODS management guidance. AFI32-7086  4 FEBRUARY 2015   21  3.6.1.1.  Class  I  ODS  are  critical  to  AF  mission  capability,  and  are  stockpiled  at  the Defense Logistics Agency Class I ODS Defense Reserve. 3.6.1.1.1.  Use  of  any  Class  I  ODS  that  is  not  required  by  a  formal  technical document (e.g., TO or commercial technical manual) is strictly prohibited. (T-0). 3.6.1.1.2.  Installations are prohibited from purchasing Class I ODS from commercial vendors. (T-0). 3.6.1.1.3.  Facility  air  conditioning,  refrigeration,  and  fire  suppression  requirements for  Class  I  ODS  must  be  met  only  from  the  existing  facility  installed  base  or  CE stocks. (T-0).  Access to the Class I ODS Defense Reserve for facility requirements is prohibited.    Transfer  of  CE  Class  I  ODS  stocks  between  AF  installations  to  meet facility requirements is permitted. 3.6.1.1.4.  Air Force Hush Houses (engine and aircraft noise suppressing enclosures) that  use  Halon  1301  fixed  fire  suppression  systems  (FFSS)  cannot  access  the  DLA Class  I  ODS  Defense  Reserve  stockpile,  internal  base  CE  Halon  1301  supplies,  or commercial  purchases  of  Halon  1301.    If  a  hush  house  Halon  1301  FFSS  becomes inoperable due to loss of Halon, the installation can (1) replace the FFSS with one of the  non-Halon  alternative  designs  approved  by  the  WR-ALC  hush  house  program office  or  (2)  recharge  the  Halon  1301  FFSS  using  only  supplies  of  Halon  1301  that were installed in one of the other Air Force Hush House FFSS as of 1 January 2008. (T-1). 3.6.1.1.5.  Installations  may  obtain  ODS  from  the  Class  I  ODS  Defense  Reserve  to meet  only  valid  Air  Force  (or  other  U.S.  Military  Service)  weapon  system requirements. (T-0).  Only the LRS HAZMART may obtain and issue ODS from the Class I ODS Defense Reserve.  Requisitions that exceed specified thresholds for each ODS product will be cancelled by the Class I ODS Defense Reserve program office unless prior AF approval has been forwarded to  DLA.  For requisitioning quantities above  the  thresholds,  the  LRS  HAZMART  shall  work  with  the  requestor  to  obtain ODS  requisition  approvals  through  the  designated  MAJCOM/ANGRC  A4  Halon the  ODS  Defense  Reserve  website focal (http://www.aviation.dla.mil/UserWeb/aviationengineering/OZONE/) for requisitioning  procedures,  thresholds,  and  logistical  protocols.    Note:  Installations should  not  submit  multiple  sequential  requisitions  in  order  to  avoid  breaking  the automatic cancellation thresholds.  The HAF HMMP team monitors monthly Defense Reserve requisition reports, and will follow-up with installation HMMP teams on any requisitions that deviate from appropriate ordering patterns. (T-1). point.  See 3.6.1.1.6.  Other than Halon used in an emergency response, Class I ODS shall not be intentionally vented or discharged to the atmosphere. (T-0). 3.6.1.1.7.  Except  for  used  solvents,  no  Class  I  ODS  may  be  transferred  out  of government ownership for any reason.  (T-0).  Except for used solvents, installations shall  turn-in  all  excess  or  unserviceable  Class  I  ODS  to  the  DLA  Class  I  ODS Defense Reserve stockpile. (T-0).  See the ODS Defense Reserve website for turn-in procedures and logistical protocols.   22  AFI32-7086  4 FEBRUARY 2015 3.6.1.1.8.  Unless  the  requiring  activity  obtains  a  Class  I  ODS  Senior  Acquisition Official  (SAO)  approval,  AFFARS  clause  5352.223-9000  shall  be  placed  on  all solicitations  and  contracts.  (T-0).    This  clause  prohibits  contractors  from  providing any  service or product  with  any specification, standard, drawing, or other document that  requires  the  use  of  a  Class  I  ODS.  Note:  The  non-directive  process  HAZMAT management  playbook  published  on  the  AF  CE  Portal  contains  copies  of  AF-wide Class I ODS SAO approvals that cover installation air conditioning, refrigeration, and fire extinguisher service contracts. 3.6.1.2.  The  Air  Force  will  not  centrally  stockpile  Class  II  ODS  to  support  continuing requirements after the phase-out of Class II ODS production in the United States. 3.6.1.2.1.  Installations shall not procure new facility systems scheduled to remain in the  Air  Force  inventory  beyond  1  January  2020  that  require  Class  II  ODS  in  their operations or maintenance. (T-2). 3.6.1.2.2.  Installations  may  not  transfer  HCFC-22  out  of  government  ownership  for any  reason,  although  transfers  between  installations  is  permitted.    Installations  shall turn-in  all  AF  excess  or  unserviceable  HCFC-22  to  the  DLA  Class  I  ODS  Defense Reserve stockpile in order to support future DoD mission critical needs (T-0). 3.6.2.  HAZMAT  Deployment  Planning.  In  planning  for  deployments,  IDOs,  and  UDMs shall  notify  the  HMMP  team  of  upcoming  deployments  so  that  the  HMMP  team  can coordinate the following HAZMAT management tasks (T-1). Note: For additional guidance, refer  to  AFH  10-222,  Volume  4,  Environmental  Considerations  for  Overseas  Contingency Operations;  AFI  10-403,  Deployment  Planning  and  Execution;  AFI  10-404,  Base  Support and  Expeditionary  Site  Planning;  and  AFPAM  91-216,  USAF  Safety  Deployment  and Contingency Pamphlet. 3.6.2.1.  Pre-Deployment Requirements (T-1). 3.6.2.1.1.  Identify  deploying  unit  Class  I  ODS  usage  (materials  and  amounts) required  for  the  duration  of  the  deployment,  and  ensure  that  pre-approvals  are  in-place if the unit will need to requisition quantities greater than 3,000 pounds.   Note: Class  I  ODS  for  deployed  units  are  supplied  by  the  DLA  Class  I  ODS  Defense Reserve  stockpile  and  issued  through  either  the  gaining  installation  HAZMART  or through the deployed unit with HAZMAT management responsibilities 3.6.2.1.2.  Coordinate  HAZMAT  management, reporting responsibilities (for the duration of the deployment) with gaining MAJCOM/Theater Command and/or deployment location.  In particular, pre-deployment planning must assign  responsibility  for  the  tracking  of  out-of-production  Halon  received  during deployment  so  that  the  Air  Force  can  account  for  any  unused  quantities  and  ensure that they are returned to the Class I ODS Defense Reserve Stockpile for use in future deployments. tracking, and 3.6.2.1.3.  The  work  area  supervisor  or  unit  commander  shall  ensure  that  a deployment  folder  is  assembled  for  each  unit  Mission  Support  Kit  that  contains HAZMAT. This folder will include as a minimum: AFI32-7086  4 FEBRUARY 2015   23  3.6.2.1.3.1.  Copies of the current manufacturer-specific SDSs for each HAZMAT the deploying unit plans to use. 3.6.2.1.3.2.  Approved  authorizations  for  the  material  from  EESOH-MIS,  listing warnings and precautions. 3.6.2.1.4.  Ensure  that  HAZMAT  received  for  WRM  storage  is  tracked  by  EESOH-MIS  for  the  purposes  of  knowing  where  and  how  much  WRM  HAZMAT  is  on  an installation. 3.6.2.2.  Deployment  Requirements. Track  HAZMAT usage data  for the duration of the deployment  IAW  pre-deployment  planning  arrangements  (T-1).  Use  EESOH-MIS,  if available, for this. 3.6.2.3.  Re-Deployment Requirements. 3.6.2.3.1.  Notify  the  HAZMART  at  the  deployed  location,  if  available,  of  any serviceable HAZMAT the deployed unit is taking back to the home station (T-1). 3.6.2.3.2.  Update the home station EESOH-MIS upon return from the deployment to reflect all HAZMAT the deployed unit brought back to the installation (T-1). 3.6.2.3.3.  Ensure proper disposition of excess HAZMAT (T-0). 3.6.2.3.4.  Return all excess  Class I ODS to  the DLA Class  I ODS Defense Reserve stockpile (T-0). 3.6.3.  Privatizing  or  Outsourcing  Installation  HMMP  Functional  Responsibilities.    Any aspect  of  the  installation  HMMP  functional  responsibilities,  including  the  HAZMART  and HAZMAT authorization responsibilities, can be performed by contractors. 3.6.3.1.  The  individual  functional  office  (CE,  Maintenance,  Supply,  etc.)  initiating  the outsourcing  action  remains  responsible  for  the  performance  of  installation-level functional  requirements,  and  must  exercise  appropriate  and  adequate  contractor performance oversight. (T-1). 3.6.3.2.  The  HMMP  Team  shall  work  with  the  requiring  activity  and  the  contracting office  to  ensure  that  these  contracts  include  specific  requirements  to  comply  with applicable federal and military procurement policies and perform specific functional tasks identified in this AFI. (T-1). 3.6.4.  EMS  Continual  Improvement  and  HAZMAT  Material  Substitution.    Installation HMMP  teams  shall  work  with  the  EMS  Cross-functional  Team  to  support  the  following EMS continual improvement activities. (T-1). 3.6.4.1.  Plan.  Use EESOH-MIS data on HAZMAT processes, locations, and quantities to  develop  and  update  aspect  inventories  and  to  initiate  action  plans  to  reduce environmental  impacts,  consistent  with  installation  priorities,  through  HAZMAT reduction and material substitution. 3.6.4.2.  Do.  Use the HMMP as a source of environmental controls and as a method of pollution prevention.  When requesting HAZMAT, work area supervisors and authorizers collaborate  to  ensure  that  the  shop  requests  the  least  hazardous  material  allowed  to  be used in a particular process in the smallest reasonable quantity that meets mission needs.   24  AFI32-7086  4 FEBRUARY 2015 3.6.4.3.  Check.

Blanket Authorization—The blanket authorization approves the use of a particular unit of issue of an HAZMAT independent of process. Each of the Authorizing Offices (CE, SE, and BE) will make  an  independent  determination  of  whether  or  not  to  provide  a  blanket  authorization  for  a specific HAZMAT  and  HAZMAT container size. Blanket  authorizations must identify specific MSNs. Data Steward—The function charged with centrally creating and managing shared records and associated  data  in  EESOH-MIS.    Stewarded  areas  include  stock  numbers,  safety  data  sheets, chemicals, manufacturers, and other commonly-used shared data in EESOH-MIS. DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve—Stockpile for out-of-production Class I ODS and HCFC-22.  Only approved source of supply for Air Force Class I ODS usage requirements. Hazard Communication (HAZCOM)—The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard found in 29 CFR 1910.1200 requires supervisors to inform the workers they supervise of the occupational safety  and  health  hazards  of  chemicals  used  in  the  workplace  and  the  proper  procedures  and equipment to use to minimize the risks of injury or sickness. Hazardous  Material  (HAZMAT)—For purposes of this AFI, the term  HAZMAT includes all items  that  are  covered  under  EPCRA  or  other  applicable  host  nation,  federal,  state,  or  local tracking  or  reporting  requirements;  covered  under  the  OSHA  HAZCOM  Standard  (29  CFR 1910.1200)  or  the  OSHA  Occupational  Exposure  to  Hazardous  Chemicals  in  Laboratories Standard  (29  CFR  1910.1450);  Class  I  or  Class  II  ODS.    The  term  HAZMAT,  as  used  in  this AFI,  excludes:  Munitions,  as  defined  by  AFI  21-200,  Munitions  and  Missile  Maintenance Management;  pharmaceuticals  managed  by  an  installation  pharmacy  or  formulary;  radioactive materials  (RAM),  as  defined  in  and  managed  IAW  AFI  40-201,  Radioactive  Materials Management; and Hazardous Waste. Hazardous Material Management Process (HMMP)—The process, described in this AFI, for coordinating  and  integrating  the  AF  activities  and  infrastructure  required  for  the  ongoing identification, authorization and tracking of HAZMAT.  HAZMAT management responsibilities are  distributed  across  the  core  AF  functions  of  Acquisition,  Logistics  Readiness  (Materiel Management), Maintenance, CE, Surgeon General (SG) (Bioenvironmental Engineering or BE), Safety  (SE),  and  Contracting.    Each  of  these  functions  remains  responsible  for  its  inherent HAZMAT  management  policies,  standards,  and  procedures.    The  HMMP  coordinates  these distributed  functional  activities  and  responsibilities  to  enable  effective  AF  enterprise-wide HAZMAT  management  and  oversight.    To  existing  functional  HAZMAT  policies  and procedures,  the  HMMP  also  adds  specific  cross-functional  HMMP  teaming,  HAZMAT authorization,  HAZMAT tracking,  and  ozone  depleting  substance  (ODS)  management requirements. Hazardous Material Management Process (HMMP) teams— At HAF and installation levels, Environmental,  Safety,  and  Occupational  Health  Councils  (ESOHC)  establish  cross-functional HMMP teams to coordinate the inherent functional HAZMAT management responsibilities and to oversee the implementation of the specific additional requirements in this AFI.  The HMMP   30  AFI32-7086  4 FEBRUARY 2015 team  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  representatives  from  CE  (representing  Environmental  and Fire  Emergency  Services),  SG,  SE,  Legal  (JA),  Maintenance,  Logistics  Readiness  (Material Management  and  Traffic  Management),  Contracting,  and  HAZMART  supervisors.  Other functional  areas  such  as  Finance,  Requirements,  Plans,  Manpower,  Public  Affairs,  HAZMAT users,  Communications  and  Information,  and  tenant  organizations  are  also  members  of  the HMMP team, as required. Hazardous  Waste  (HAZWASTE)—Any  material  subject  to  the  hazardous  waste  manifest requirements of Environmental  Protection Agency  specified in  40 CFR Part 262 and meets  the definition in 40 CFR § 261.3 according to AFI 32-7042, Waste Management. HAZMART—The term used in this AFI for the location, organization, or function that performs the HTA requirement (see below). HAZMAT Tracking Activity (HTA)—Any unit that uses HAZMAT must be supported by an HTA,  where  inventory  receipt  and  issue  data  are  captured  into  EESOH-MIS.    An  HTA  is  the only entity on an installation authorized to issue government-owned HAZMAT from any source (e.g. GPC, AF Form 9, or any DoD standard supply system). Each installation must have at least one  HTA  established  by,  and  accountable  to,  the  Logistics  Readiness  Squadron  (LRS) commander or equivalent. (T-1). In addition, HTAs can be established within other organizations to facilitate HAZMAT tracking across the installation. This AFI uses the term “HAZMART” to describe the location, organization, or function that performs the HTA requirement. Inadvertent  Release—Unintended and unplanned releases.  Inadvertent  releases do not  include releases  resulting  from  the  intended  use  of  the  material  (e.g.,  the  release  of  Halon  in  actual firefighting or rendering a fuel tank inert). Ozone  Depleting  Substance  (ODS)—Refers  to  Class  I  and  Class  II  ODS,  as  defined  by  the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.  Also, as defined in 40 CFR Part 82, implementing CAA§ 602. Process—A uniquely defined “unit of work” bounded by (1) ESOH regulatory drivers, and (2) hazard  recognition,  evaluation,  and  control.  Shops  provide  the  TO  number,  title,  page,  and paragraph  information  that  identify  the  work  “step”  in  an  overall  process.  However,  this information is captured only as a "driver" for the identified process; TO “steps” are not the sole determinants in defining a process. Process—specific  Authorization—BE,  SE,  or  CE  approvals  to  authorize  the  use  of  a  given HAZMAT. Process-specific authorizations approve the use of a particular HAZMAT in a given process in specified amounts. Requiring  Document—The document that establishes or identifies the requirement for the use of the requested HAZMAT in a work area. The requiring document will be a TO, owner/operator manual, work specification, or drawing. Senior  Acquisition  Official  (SAO)—For the  purpose  of  ozone  depleting  substance management,  this  term  comes  from  US  law,  and  refers  in  the  Air  Force  to  the  SAF/AQ  three-letter  organization  that  coordinates  with  AF/A4L  and  AF/A4C  to  provide  centralized  HAF control of the ODS program. AFI32-7086  4 FEBRUARY 2015   31  User—Anyone or any organization utilizing hazardous material in the performance of their Air Force mission. Work Area—A definable location where personnel perform work. This can be outdoors (e.g., an aircraft trim pad) or indoor; administrative or industrial; or any installation-level location where a  hazardous  material  is  used  in  the  performance  of  a  specific  process.  Synonymous  with  work center.
