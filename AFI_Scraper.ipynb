      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 10Preface Force protection is a commander’s top priority in any military operation. For this reason, civil engineers must always be aware of the latest tactics, tech-niques, and procedures (TTPs) used to protect our forces, particularly in hos-tile environments. Engineers implement physical security measures to protect personnel and critical assets needed to achieve military objectives. To assist in these efforts, this handbook is intended to be a reference for constructing and  employing  expedient  fighting  positions,  obstacles,  shelters,  and  revet-ments. It focuses primarily  upon measures engineers can employ to protect airbases and mitigate the effects of direct- and indirect-fired weapons. This handbook should be used in conjunction with AFH 10-222, Volume 3, Civil Engineer Guide to Expeditionary Force Protection, as well as other 10-222 series AF Handbooks and 10-219 series AF Pamphlets. Although many of the TTPs described are designed to protect critical resources through hardening and  the  use  of  obstacles,  commanders  must  not  lose  sight  of  the  fact  that standoff provides the best chance of success in protecting the force. In addi-tion  to  the  information  contained  in  the  aforementioned  publications,  civil engineers should be familiar with the security engineering series of Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) and the latest guidance provided by those organiza-tions constantly testing materials and designs to provide better protection for our  military  forces.  These  include  organizations  such  as  the  Air  Force  Re-search Laboratory (AFRL) and the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Protective Design Center (PDC). This handbook does not address TTPs de-signed  to  defeat  the  vehicle-borne  improvised  explosive  device  (VBIED) threat. The Air Force Battlelab, through extensive testing, developed an ex-cellent  handbook  for  this  purpose.  AFH  10-2401, Vehicle  Bomb  Mitigation Guide  (FOUO),  focuses  on  the  threat  of  VBIED  attacks  and  describes  the latest TTPs that can be employed to defeat this tactic. This handbook does not contain information for designing collective protection shelters. This informa-tion can be found in AFMAN 10-2502 series publications and USACE Engi-neering Technical Letters (ETLs) 1110-3-490 and 1110-3-498. USACE ETLs can be downloaded from http://www.usace.army.mil/.    \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 11Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1. Overview. Although tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in modern warfare have evolved throughout history, the basic concepts of de-fense and the use of earthworks remain critical elements of force protection (FP).  Historically,  earthworks  consisted  of  three  parts:  a  ditch  or  trench,  a short mound of earth material (a parapet) on the enemy side of the ditch to disrupt the enemy’s flow, and a higher mound on the defenders’ side of the ditch for protection and to cover troop movements (Figure 1.1). Earthworks were often reinforced with wood, stone, and rocks and fortified with stakes to provide  additional  obstacles  to  slow  down  the  enemy’s  approach  or defend against larger weapons like the catapult and cannon. This concept of defense and other methods of fortification carry over to modern uses of earthworks. The  TTPs  covered  in  this  handbook  relate  to  the  construction  and  employ-ment  of  defensive  fighting  positions,  protective  shelters,  obstacles,  and  re-vetments. Although the TTPs are aimed at mitigating the effects of blast and fragmentation  effects  from  conventional  weapons,  many  of  these  measures can also provide protection against the effects of nuclear weapons. However, refer to AFTTP(I) 3-2.46, Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for  Nuclear,  Biological,  and  Chemical  (NBC)  Protection,  for  guidance  on constructing  fighting  positions  and  using  existing  shelters  for  protection against NBC effects. Before protective measures can be employed effectively in an expeditionary environment, it is necessary to understand the threat.   Figure 1.1. Historic Earthworks.   \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 121.2. The Threat. Direct- and indirect-fired weapons are common threats to airbases.  Direct-fired  weapons  are  projectiles  designed  to  penetrate  exterior protection. These weapons are highly accurate and capable of firing different types of projectiles including: (1) chemical or kinetic energy projectiles, (2) ball or tracer rounds, and (3) armor piercing rounds or high explosive shaped charges. Indirect-fired weapons include mortars, artillery shells, rockets, and bombs. These types of weapons are highly mobile and easily concealed. They can be fired from launchers or set on timers to allow aggressors time to es-cape  prior  to  launch.  Indirect-fired  weapons  do  not  require  a  clear  line  of sight to a specific target; aggressors rely on blast and fragmentation effects to damage or destroy their intended targets. Table 1.1 lists typical weapons and describes their effects. Planners must consider these potential threats.  Table 1.1. Typical Weapons and Their Effects. Weapon Effects Projectiles: small arms and aircraft cannons, direct- and indirect-fired projectiles, grenades, etc.  Bombs: high-explosive (HE), fire and incendiary, dispenser, cluster, etc. Rockets and Missiles: Tactical and battlefield support weapons, etc. Special Purpose Weapons: Fuel-air munitions, incendiary, demolition charges, etc. Penetration, spalling, blast, fragmentation. Blast, fragmentation, target penetration, ground shock, cratering, ejecta, extreme heat and fire. Target penetration, blast, fragmentation, ground shock, cratering, and ejecta. Airblast, intense heat, noxious gases, oxy-gen deprivation, in-structure shock, crater-ing, ground shock.  1.2.1. Blast and Fragmentation Effects. Exploding munitions produce ex-treme hazards such as blast and fragmentation. Mitigating the effects of these weapons must be a top priority for civil engineers during contingencies. Bed-down and sustainment efforts might become futile if the force itself is vulner-able  to  a  potentially  devastating  attack.  Blast  and  fragmentation  effects  are briefly described in the following paragraphs.   \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 131.2.1.1. Blast Effects. Explosive charges release an enormous amount of en-ergy instantaneously through thermal radiation and shock waves. The shock wave  is  a  compression  wave  that  causes  the  atmospheric  pressure  to  rise (overpressure) and peak in a fraction of a microsecond, followed by a slower (hundredths of a second) decline in atmospheric pressure, referred to as the positive phase of the shock wave. The pressure continues to decline to subat-mospheric pressure (negative phase of the shock wave), and then returns to normal (Figure 1.2). The positive impulse (intense pressure), represented by the area below the positive phase of the pressure-time curve, causes serious damage  and  destruction.  It  is  important  to  know  that  blasts  from  high-explosive  shells  or  rockets  occur  in  three  distinct  ways:  (1)  overhead  burst from artillery,  which can destroy structures from the top; (2) contact burst; artillery shells that explode upon impact, causing excavations and other struc-tures to collapse from ground shock or foundation instability; and (3) delay fuze bursts, which are projectiles designed to penetrate a target before deto-nating. Information on the effects of blasts on all types of structures can be found on the USACE PDC website at https://pdc.usace.army.mil.  Figure 1.2. Pressure-Time Curve.    \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 141.2.1.2. Fragmentation Effects. Fragmentation effects of weapons are char-acterized as either primary or secondary fragmentation. Fragmenting weapons are designed to propel debris from their casings (primary fragmentation) to-wards  a  target  to  damage  or  destroy  it.  Secondary  fragmentation  is  caused when the force of a blast causes objects to break apart, propelling additional debris  towards  critical  assets  at  extremely  high  velocities.  The  following paragraphs explain these effects in more detail. 1.2.1.2.1. Primary Fragmentation. Primary fragmentation is caused by the breakup or shattering of weapon casings upon detonation. The steel casings of  fragmenting  weapons  are  designed  to  produce  a  mass  amount  of  debris traveling at a high rate of speed (thousands of feet per second) when the pro-jectile  detonates  and  disintegrates.  Fragmentation  effects  caused  by detona-tion  of  a  high-explosive  bomb  have  a  greater  effective  range  than  blast  ef-fects. These types of weapons are very effective against unprotected person-nel and other soft targets. The destructive power of fragmenting weapons is maximized by using bombs specifically designed to achieve this effect or by using bombs with airburst functioning fuzes. Although fragmentation effects can be mitigated by well-designed obstructions on the ground, planners must also consider the effect of a direct hit or an airburst.  1.2.1.2.2.  Secondary  Fragmentation.  Secondary  fragmentation  is  caused when blast pressure from a weapon detonation exerts enough force upon ex-isting structures in close proximity to cause the structure to break apart and become  additional  projectiles  traveling  at  high  rates  of  speed.  Although  it may be impractical to harden temporary structures to resist the effects of blast or fragmentation without sufficient standoff, properly constructed protective structures such as berms and revetments can provide some degree of protec-tion without posing the risk of becoming fragmentation hazards themselves. To be effective, berms and revetments must be properly sited in relation to the assets they are intended to protect. Siting and constructing berms and re-vetments are covered in more detail in Chapter 5 of this handbook.     \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 151.3. Planning. Civil engineers must develop plans to employ physical secu-rity measures designed to mitigate the effects of an enemy attack. This is a unique challenge in the expeditionary environment, since mobility assets are usually  not  designed  to  be  capable  of  withstanding  attacks  from  different types  of  weapons.  For  this  reason,  standoff,  modern  application  of  earth-works, and other expedient methods are used to counter known threats.   1.3.1. Planning Factors. Some key factors engineers consider while planning for  physical  security  include  desired  levels  of  protection,  potential  threats, criticality and vulnerability assessments, and acceptable levels of risk. In ad-dition, planners must take into account the type of structures to be deployed, available  funding,  existing  infrastructure  (including  natural  and  manmade features),  available  standoff, and  local  resources  available,  such  as  contract support and indigenous construction materials. These factors, and any others unique to the deployed location, form the basis for force protection planning.  1.3.2. Levels of Protection. Physical security measures are employed to ob-tain  certain  levels  of  protection.  These  protection  levels  are  usually  based upon known threats and the results of intelligence and assessment reports. It is unrealistic to believe all assets can be protected and the threat completely eliminated. This perception causes valuable resources to be wasted or misal-located. Risk management is based on the assumption that some risks must be taken to ensure limited resources are applied against the highest priority as-sets first, rather than all assets equally. Criticality assessments usually result in the assignment of certain values to particular assets. They reveal the degree of debilitating impact that destruction of certain assets would have upon the mission; obviously, personnel come first. Unacceptable losses require higher levels  of  protection.  Assets  most  critical  to  the  mission  must  be  afforded higher  levels  of  protection,  especially  if  vulnerability  assessments  indicate these assets are not already sufficiently protected. Different levels of protec-tion  are  described  in  UFC  4-020-01,  DOD  Security  Engineering  Facilities Planning  Manual.  The  following  paragraphs  cover  the  assessments  usually conducted to assist commanders in determining levels of protection.   \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 161.3.3. Threat Assessment. This assessment is used to identify threats based on  key  factors  such  as  the  existence,  capability,  and  intentions  of  potential hostile forces and terrorist groups. Group activities and the operational envi-ronment are also considered. Potential threats are categorized in various ways (e.g., terrorists, saboteurs, spies, extremists, criminals). Any weapons, tools, and explosives likely to be used in an attack upon DOD personnel or critical assets are also identified during the assessment. 1.3.4. Criticality Assessment. The criticality assessment is the process used to systematically identify key assets (e.g., personnel, equipment, stockpiles, buildings) deemed mission critical by commanders based on their importance to  the  mission  or  function.  This  assessment  forms  the  basis  for  prioritizing assets requiring certain levels of protection. Commanders  must consider all assets that need protection, all required protective measures, and all available resources (e.g., time, materials, personnel, equipment). 1.3.5. Vulnerability Assessment. The vulnerability assessment is an evalua-tion conducted to determine if key assets are provided appropriate levels of protection. Protection levels are based on minimum standards where no spe-cific threat has been identified or on higher levels of protection where a spe-cific  threat  has  been  identified.  This  assessment  analyzes  the  threat,  likely tactics, and key targets that may be vulnerable to attack. 1.3.6. Risk Assessment. Risk assessments help commanders make decisions on  the  most  effective  ways  to  allocate  limited  resources  needed  to  protect personnel and critical assets. The assessment is based upon the results of the threat, criticality, and vulnerability assessments. Based on these assessments, the commander commits resources to achieve certain levels of protection for personnel and mission-critical assets. With limited resources, all assets cannot be afforded equal levels of protection. Risk Management provides the com-mander with the best information available to make resource allocation deci-sions. If plans do not incorporate these assessments, they will likely be too reactive and cause limited resources to be misdirected or wasted. For addi-tional information on the assessments used in determining levels of protec-tion, refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 3, Civil Engineer Guide to Expeditionary Force Protection.  \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 171.3.7. Resources. Planners must identify resources needed to implement se-curity measures throughout all stages of deployments. A limited amount of resources  usually  drives  the  need  to  apply  risk  management  to  ensure  the most critical assets are adequately protected. The following paragraphs cover the areas planners must consider.  1.3.7.1. Funding. Funding for FP resources must be given the highest prior-ity. Although civil engineers may not be directly involved with funding deci-sions at the highest levels, it is important to know that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has access to a special fund, known as the Combating Terrorism  Readiness  Initiative  Fund  (CbTRIF).  The  CbTRIF  is  a  joint-services  fund  designed  to  fund  projects  for  emergent  or  high-priority  force protection  equipment  or  construction.  These  funds  can  be  used  to  procure physical  security  equipment  to  reduce  vulnerabilities.  Requests  for  funding through  this  process  must  be  for  unanticipated  requirements  where  the  ur-gency for funding cannot be met through the normal Service funding process. However funds are obtained, ensure all FP requirements are clearly identified and address the exact purpose for which the requirements are needed, includ-ing vulnerabilities that commanders must addressed (unless classified). 1.3.7.2. Materials and Equipment. Class IV materials (i.e., construction and barrier materials) are available through many sources, including the Defense Logistics Agency’s Defense Supply Centers at https://www.dla.mil. Planners should  become  familiar  with  these  sources  and  the  different  types  of  con-struction materials that can be acquired. If construction materials and other equipment  resources  (e.g.,  earth-moving  and  material  handling  equipment) are  not  readily  available  in  the  deployed  area,  these  items  may  need  to  be purchased and brought forward to establish some level of protection during initial beddown. Planners must also be aware that locally available materials and  equipment  may  be  of  inferior  quality,  making  it  difficult  to  implement effective FP measures. When planning for materials and equipment, consider the  possibility  of  increased  threats  that  may  require  additional  resources. Also, consider the possibility of pre-positioning FP resources at or near the site as war reserve materiel; this will provide the capability to quickly imple-ment physical security measures in conjunction with initial beddown.   \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 181.3.8. Training. Every effort must be made to ensure civil engineers are suf-ficiently  trained  on  physical  security  TTPs  prior  to  deploying.  Hands-on training is needed to ensure deploying personnel are proficient in constructing critical  structures  such  as  guard  towers, berms,  ditches  and  protective shel-ters. There are several training venues available to assist civil engineers prior to expeditionary deployments. 1.3.8.1. US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Protective Design Center (PDC).  The  USACE  PDC  offers  several  training  courses  on  security  engi-neering and protective design. These courses are in-resident and range from two to eight days. Some courses cover the different software programs used to  estimate  blast  effects.  For  example,  the  Blast  Effects  Estimation  Model (BEEM) is an assessment tool used to estimate facility damage and personnel injuries resulting from an attack. The BlastX software performs calculations of shock wave effects. Keep in mind, engineers using this software must be extremely familiar with the different programs and their application to avoid miscalculating  or  misinterpreting  specific  outputs.  Mobile  Training  Teams (MTTs) can also be scheduled to conduct security engineering courses at a unit’s home station. However, the unit must pay all expenses related to bring-ing  MTTs  to  their  location.  The  PDC  also  has  an  on-line  open  forum  that allows  members  to  post  questions  and  receive  information  from  engineers who are experts in a variety of areas. For additional information, go to the PDC website at https://pdc.usace.army.mil. 1.3.8.2. Theater Construction Management System (TCMS). TCMS is a PC-based automated construction planning, design, management, and report-ing  system  that  is  used  by  military  engineers  for  contingency  construction activities. Its primary purpose is to support OCONUS (outside the Continen-tal  United  States)  requirements.  It  combines  state-of-the-art  computer  hard-ware and software with Army Facilities Component System (AFCS) design information to support and enhance the accomplishment of engineer mission activities in the theater of operation or other mission arenas. A wealth of in-formation, including drawings and specifications for expeditionary structures, such  a  guard  towers,  revetments,  and  various  obstacles,  can  be  retrieved through TCMS at http://www.tcms.net.   \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 191.4.  Protective  Construction.  Protective  construction  refers  to  the  design, construction,  and  layout  of  facilities  to  support  an  integrated  and  in-depth plan to protect personnel and critical assets from enemy attack. From a civil engineer perspective, these efforts should be focused on activities related to survivability. The mission cannot be successfully accomplished if the force is devastated  by  enemy  attacks.  Survivability,  defined  in  JP  3-34,  Engineer Doctrine for Joint Operations, involves a concept aimed at protecting all as-pects of a military operation (e.g., personnel, weapons, supplies) while simul-taneously maintaining the capability to deceive the enemy. Survivability tac-tics include building a strong defense; employing frequent movement tactics; using  camouflage,  concealment,  and  deception  (CCD);  and  constructing fighting and protective positions for personnel and equipment (Figure 1.3). In addition to guidance provided in this handbook, several publications (clas-sified FOUO) provide detailed guidance to ensure appropriate levels of pro-tection  are  provided  for  key  assets  based  on  specific  locations  and  threats. These documents, sometimes referred to as the security engineering series of UFCs, are listed in Table 1.2. In addition to UFCs, planners should be famil-iar  with  the  latest  TTPs  outlined  in  the  Joint  Contingency  Operations  Base (JCOB) Force Protection Handbook and the Joint Forward Operations Base (JFOB)  Force  Protection  Handbook.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 21Chapter 2 FIGHTING POSITIONS 2.1. Overview. Fighting positions are fortified structures used for protection against  hostile  fire.  They  can  also  be  used  as  central  points  from  which  to direct fire at offensive forces and provide overlapping fields of fire with adja-cent fighting positions. The positions are constructed either hastily or deliber-ately, depending on the availability of time, materials, and the threat. Ideally, they should be sited to take advantage of natural terrain that conceals them and obscures direct lines of sight while providing a means to direct fire to-wards the enemy. Overhead cover is constructed when time is not a factor. The most important point to remember when constructing a fighting position is to make sure it cannot be detected. Do not site these positions where the enemy expects to find them. Once detected, the “element of surprise” will be lost. Camouflage should be applied to these positions to further complicate the enemy’s ability to detect them. All of these tactics provide security forces with the capability needed to decisively eliminate attempts to penetrate camp boundaries or launch attacks upon military installations.  2.2. Safety. Safety is paramount to constructing fighting positions. Personnel have  been  killed  and  injured  as  a  result  of  improperly  constructed  fighting positions. FM 5-34, Engineer Field Data, FM 5-103, Survivability, and Gov-ernment  Training  Aid  (GTA)  05-08-001,  Survivability  Positions,  contain guidance for proper construction. Supervisors must ensure their personnel are trained on these procedures and should always supervise the actual construc-tion.  Once  constructed,  these  positions  must  be  inspected  frequently,  espe-cially after the area experiences heavy rainfall and immediately after an at-tack. Table 2.1 contains basic criteria for constructing fighting positions.   2.3. Materials.  During  contingencies,  engineers use  whatever  materials  are available to construct and fortify fighting positions. Attachment 2 lists pro-tective  characteristics  of  some  materials  that  can  be  used  for  these  efforts along with information that can be used to determine the required thickness of materials needed to mitigate the effects of various types of weapons.   \f",

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 232.4. Hasty Fighting Positions. Hasty fighting positions are used when time and materials are limited. They can be constructed using whatever objects or materials that inhabit the area (i.e., dirt, trees, logs, boulders, etc.). If an exist-ing depression is available, it can be used as a hasty fighting position. Hasty  fighting positions are constructed by digging a hole at least 18 inches deep for protection against indirect fire. The position should be able to accommodate the occupant, be at least 24 inches wide, and include parapets for frontal and flank cover. Ideally, the position is sited where natural cover from direct fire is  available  (i.e.,  trees,  large  rocks,  rubble,  etc.).  This  helps  to  conceal  the position and make enemy detection difficult. If natural cover is not available, use the soil excavated from the hole or other fill material in the surrounding area to construct parapets. NOTE: Do not leave fresh soil exposed – the en-tire position must be camouflaged. Parapets should be at least 18 inches high, 36  inches  thick,  and  6  inches  (one-helmet  distance)  away  from  the  hole.  If logs are used instead of soil or sandbags, they must be held firmly in place with  strong  stakes  2  to  3  inches  in  diameter  and  approximately  18  inches long. Frontal cover is constructed for protection against small caliber direct fire. Flank and rear cover is used to mitigate the effects of indirect fire burst to the flank and rear. Hasty fighting positions can be set up quickly with little effort, but provide a minimum amount of protection. If properly located, and the unit will remain in the area, improve the position as time permits to in-clude  overhead  cover.  Use  the  basic  criteria  presented  earlier  in Table  2.1 and  FM  5-103  when  constructing  hasty  fighting  positions.  The  following paragraphs contain brief descriptions of various hasty fighting positions.  2.4.1. Crater Positions. Crater positions, which are depressions in the ground caused by exploding shells or bombs, can provide protection under direct fire. These positions should be at least 2 to 3 feet wide and 18 inches deep. The trenching tool is used to dig a steep face or parapet for added protection.  2.4.2. Skirmisher’s Trench. A skirmisher’s trench can also provide immedi-ate cover. This position requires troops to lie down in the prone position and use  the  entrenching  tool  or  other  means  to  scrape  the  surrounding  soil  and build parapets between themselves and the direction of enemy fire.  \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 242.4.3.  Prone  Position.  The  prone  position,  illustrated  in  Figure  2.1,  is  an improved skirmisher’s trench that conforms to the position and body length of its occupant. It serves as a good firing position and provides better protec-tion from direct fire weapons than the crater or skirmisher’s trench. Parapets, 18 inches in height, should be constructed around the position for protection against  indirect  fire.  However,  because  this  is  essentially  a  hasty  position, overhead cover is not usually constructed.   Figure 2.1. Hasty Fighting Position.   2.5.  Deliberate  Fighting  Positions.  Deliberate  fighting  positions  are  de-signed to accommodate personnel, their equipment, and certain weapons to be  employed  from  the  position.  These  positions  are  more  protective  and should be constructed if a unit will be in a particular location for an extended time. Several types of deliberate fighting positions can be constructed based on (1) the weapon to be employed from the position, (2) the number of per-sonnel that will occupy the position, and (3) the amount of gear and equip-ment the position must accommodate. Supervisors ensure positions are prop-erly  constructed  and  overlapping  fields  of  fire  are  provided  with  adjacent fighting  positions.  The  next  few  paragraphs  describe  procedures  for  con-structing deliberate  fighting positions.  Although  some  guidance  is provided here, refer to FM 5-103 for details on constructing intercepting trenches for fighting positions sited in areas that may experience ground shock.   \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 252.5.1.  One-Person  Deliberate  Fighting  Position.  One-person  deliberate fighting positions (Figure 2.2) are constructed when time and materials are available and the tactical situation warrants additional protection. The exca-vation is relatively small, making it easier to use materials from the surround-ing  area  for  overhead  cover  and  camouflage.  This  position  must  allow  the individual to fire to the front and oblique while behind frontal cover. All of the basic construction criteria established for one-person deliberate fighting positions  also applies  to  fighting  positions constructed  on  larger  scales  and for different reasons. Critical aspects of constructing a one-person deliberate fighting position will be covered first; variations to these basics will follow. Figure 2.2. One-Person Deliberate Fighting Position.   2.5.1.1. Sectors of Fire. Sectors of fire are usually assigned by security per-sonnel and form the basis for siting positions. If possible, select an area that will provide natural frontal cover protection from enemy direct fire. If natural cover is unavailable where the position is sited, construct parapets.     \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 262.5.1.2.  Aiming  and  Sector  Stakes.  Aiming  and  sector  stakes  can  be  em-placed to help security personnel with firing and to define sectors of fire. Out-line the position as shown in Figure 2.3. For a one-person position, the hole is usually about the length of an M-16 (roughly 3 feet and 3 inches long) and as wide as two helmets (roughly 2 feet). NOTE: This usually is not done for hasty fighting positions.   2.5.1.3. Parapets. Prepare parapet retaining walls using logs or other natural materials. If logs are used, stake them down firmly with stakes about 2 to 3 inches in diameter and 18 inches long. The walls should be at least 6 inches (one-helmet distance) from the edge of the hole. Build the front wall first, at least two sandbags high (approximately 18 inches), 36 inches thick, and the length  of  two  M-16s  (approximately  6  feet  and  6  inches  long).  Sandbags should be 75 percent full. Next, build flank walls with the same height and thickness as that of the front wall, with the length being approximately equal to that of one M-16. The rear wall should be one sandbag high and one M-16 long. Dig the hole to armpit depth and slope the walls. Throw the excavated soil forward of the parapet retaining walls and pack it down hard.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 272.5.1.4.  Grenade  Sumps.  Determining  where  to  locate  grenade  sumps  de-pends  on  the  type  of  fighting  position  being  constructed.  For  a  one-person fighting position, grenade sumps (Figure 2.4) should be dug into the bottom front  face  of  the  position  at  approximately  a  30-degree  angle  and  12  to  18 inches deep, about the length of an entrenching tool. The width of the sump should  be  approximately  equal  to  the width  of  the  entrenching  tool  shovel. Use whatever tools are available to slope the floor towards the grenade sump. This will make it easier to kick a grenade into the hole and get out of the way so the blast goes into the back wall. For a larger, two-person fighting posi-tion, grenade sumps are usually dug at each end of the position to allow oc-cupants to move towards the opposite end away from the blast. Avoid locat-ing  grenade  sumps  under  overhead  cover,  especially  if  the  cover  is  con-structed across the middle of the fighting position. The blast could reflect off the cover and cause injuries or collapse the entire structure. A combination of grenade  sump  trenches  and  holes  can  be  used  for  special-purpose  fighting positions.  A  T-shaped  position  allows  for  additional  observation  or  firing zones but  may require additional grenade sumps. Make sure the blast from the sump is not directed towards any occupied sections of the position.  Figure 2.4. Grenade Sump – One-Person Fighting Position.     \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 282.5.1.5. Fighting Position Revetments. In wet, sandy, or poorly compacted soils,  revetments  are  used  to  reinforce  the  sides  of  fighting  positions  and trenches to prevent collapse (Figure 2.5). Revetting is also necessary when positions  are  dug  in  soils  with  large  amounts  of  clay  or  high  plasticity  as these  soils  may  liquefy,  displace,  or  shear  from  ground  shock.  Without  re-vetments, the walls of a position in sandy soils would have to be sloped to achieve  a  certain  depth.  However,  this  is  not  recommended  since  the  top opening of the position would be too wide, making it difficult to incorporate overhead  cover.  Revet  fighting  positions  using  material  held  in  place  with either braced or tied pickets. Pickets can be lumber, wooden poles, standard concertina wire pickets, metal poles, angular posts, or trees. Wooden pickets from trees or saplings should be at least 3 inches in diameter. The pickets are used to hold matting material (i.e., brushwood mats, lumber, wire mesh, geo-textile fabric, cloth mat, etc.) against the soil face. More rigid facing materials include plywood, landing mats, corrugated metal, and timbers. Use the field expedient  procedures  outlined  in  Attachment  3  to  classify  soils  and  deter-mine whether revetments are needed.  Figure 2.5. Fighting Position Revetment.     \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 292.5.1.6. Crawl Trenches. If time is available and the overall defensive pos-ture needs to be enhanced, crawl trenches can be constructed to connect fight-ing positions and prevent personnel from being exposed to enemy fire as they move about the area. The depth of these trenches is based on the availability of  time  and  resources.  Engineers  will  have  to  assist  others  with  excavation and  trench  reinforcement  (Figure  2.6).  Crawl  trenches  should  be  dug  in  a zigzagged pattern to prevent the enemy from being able to fire down a long section if the trench is breached. This pattern will also help to reduce the ef-fects of fragmentation if the crawl trench is hit with explosive munitions.   2.5.1.7. Ground Shock Intercept Trenches. Since fighting positions might be needed in areas subject to high levels of ground shock based on certain soil or geological conditions, civil engineers must have some general knowl-edge of geology and different soil types. Ground shock sufficient enough to collapse  fighting  positions  can  occur  when  these  positions  are  constructed over water tables too close to the bottom of the positions or in areas where the soil  is  located  within  25  feet  of  and/or  over  an  underlying  rock  formation, moist clay, or soils with high water content. Ground shock is intensified by reduced resistance through the soil or reflection from the underlying soil and rock formations. One way to reduce the effect of ground shock on fighting positions  involves  constructing  ground  shock  intercept  trenches.  Ground shock intercept trenches are meant to collapse from ground shock and thereby absorb enough of the ground shock to prevent fighting positions from collaps-ing. These types of trenches are dug approximately 12 inches wide to a depth that is at least 2 feet deeper than the fighting positions they are intended to protect. They should also be at least 6 feet longer than the width of the fight-ing position. Locate the trenches away from fighting positions at a distance approximately 1 1/2 to 2 times the depth of the trench, as illustrated in Figure 2.7.  Due  to  their  narrow  width,  these  trenches  can  easily  be  camouflaged. Table 2.2 can be used as a checklist to ensure revetments, crawl trenches, and ground shock intercept trenches are being properly constructed.          \f",

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 322.5.1.8. Fighting Position Overhead Protection and Cover. Fighting posi-tion overhead protection is used to mitigate the effects of blast and fragmen-tation from direct- and indirect-fired weapons. Cover provides concealment and  protects  against  weather.  Overhead  protection  and  cover  are  always needed unless it will  make the position easy to detect. The following para-graphs cover basic concepts for overhead protection and cover. Attachment 2 contains information on thicknesses for protection against certain weapons. However, always reference FM 5-103, GTA 05-08-001, and GTA 07-06-001, Fighting Position Construction Infantry Leader’s Reference Card.  2.5.1.8.1.  Roof  Supports.  For  standard  one-  and  two-person  fighting  posi-tions, 4-inch x 4-inch x 6-foot lumber or timber equivalents are normally used for roof supports. To form the base structure for overhead cover, logs or lum-ber 4 to 6 inches in diameter can be used. Table 2.3 compares cut timber to the equivalent size of processed lumber. If logs are used, secure them with stakes  approximately  2  to  3  inches  in  diameter  and  about  18  inches  long. Make sure bearing support beams are properly positioned. Set support logs back a distance equal to approximately 1/4 the depth of the hole and embed-ded approximately halfway into the ground as illustrated in Figure 2.8. Set overhead cover supports back about 1 foot or 1/4 the depth of the hole.  2.5.1.8.2. Stringers. Stringers are made from solid and sturdy material, such as  lumber  or  timber,  and  are  used  to  support  overhead  cover.  For  standard one-  and  two-person  fighting  positions,  4-inch  x  4-inch  x  8-foot  lumber  or timber  equivalents  are  normally  used  and  spaced  6  inches  on-center.  On-center  spacing  is  critical  to  the  safety  of  fighting  positions.  If  stringers  are placed too far apart, they will be less capable of carrying the dead weight of overhead cover. Stringer span (the unsupported distance between each end of material used as stringers) is also critical. Table 2.4, extracted from GTA 05-08-001, can be used to determine span and center-to-center spacing for wood-supporting soil cover to defeat various contact bursts. Figure 2.9 illustrates stringer placement for overhead cover. Ensure stringers are approximately the same  size  as  roof  supports,  are  laid  side  by  side  across  them,  extending  at least 1-foot past the supports on each side of the fighting position.   \f",

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 382.5.1.9. Concealment and Camouflage. The most important consideration in constructing fighting positions is making sure they cannot be detected. After overhead cover is constructed, use concealment and camouflage techniques to make the position undetectable. Concealment is anything that hides the fight-ing position from enemy observation. It may be natural material (i.e., bushes, leaves,  grass,  etc.)  or  artificial  material  (i.e.,  burlap,  nets,  etc.).  If  possible, locate fighting positions where natural cover, such as bushes, tall grass, trees, logs, stumps, mountainous terrain, or large rocks can help to conceal them. Take advantage of natural cover (i.e., wooded areas, hills, rock formations) for  concealment,  and  cover  shiny  objects  such  as  watches,  compasses,  and bayonets. Camouflage is used to blend the position with the surrounding ter-rain. The key to camouflaging fighting positions is to alter the appearance of the  asset  being  protected  in  a  manner  where  it  becomes  part  of  the  back-ground. Camouflage also makes use of natural and manmade material. Study the terrain and vegetation of the area. Natural cover could include materials such  as  trees,  brush,  grass,  leaves,  rocks,  or  boulders.  When  using  natural cover for concealment, be careful not to disturb the look of the natural sur-roundings – use materials commonly found in the area where an asset is to be concealed. If vegetation/foliage is used to camouflage a position, it must be replaced before it dries and turns colors, making the position stand out in its surroundings.  Since  fresh  soil  can  be  used  to  detect  a  fighting  position,  it must be disposed of far away from the position. Be careful not to leave tracks leading  to  or  from  the  position.  Do  not  use  too  much  material;  this  could make the position stand out from its surroundings. Once the position is com-pleted, inspect it from the enemy's viewpoint. As a final test of camouflage and concealment efforts, mark off 35 meters (38 yards) in the direction of the enemy  and  look  back  at  the  position  to  determine  if  it  is  undetectable  and blends in with the surrounding area.         \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 392.5.2.  Two-Person  Deliberate  Fighting  Position.  Two-person  deliberate fighting positions are most common. Basic requirements for these positions are essentially the same as those for one-person fighting positions with key differences. Although this position is preferred, it is not without drawbacks. Two-person  fighting  positions  require  more  digging  and  prove  difficult  to camouflage. It also provides a better target for grenades because the excava-tion is larger. Typical combat gear such as the M-16 rifle and helmet can be used to measure dimensions (Figure 2.12). For example, the length of a two-person  fighting  position  can  be  measured  using  two  M-16  rifles  (approxi-mately  6  feet  and  6  inches).  The  width  can  be  measured  with  two  helmets (approximately  2  feet).  The  following  paragraphs  describe  details  for  con-structing two-person fighting positions. Figure 2.12. Two-Person Deliberate Fighting Position.   2.5.2.1. Sectors of Fire. Unlike the one-person deliberate fighting position, the two-person fighting position involves two fields of fire. Fighters occupy opposite ends of the position after being assigned specific sectors of fire. This is referred to as clearing primary and secondary fields of fire.   2.5.2.2. Aiming and Sector Stakes. Place sector stakes and aiming stakes (if needed) at both ends of the fighting position to help stabilize the weapon dur-ing firing and assist in targeting when visibility is limited. Position grazing logs or sandbags between the sector stakes for each field of fire.  \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 402.5.2.3.  Parapets.  Construct  parapets  approximately  one-helmet  distance from the edge of the excavation. Start with the front parapet, and then con-struct the flank and rear parapets.  2.5.2.4. Outlining the Fighting Position. Outline the position on the ground using a tree limb or anything available. A two-person deliberate fighting posi-tion is usually rectangular in shape. The length of the deliberate two-person fighting  position  is  approximately  two  M-16s  long.  The  width  is  about  the length of two helmets. Scoop out elbow holes to help stabilize the weapon when firing.   2.5.2.5. Digging. Dig the position armpit deep, throwing the dirt forward to the front parapet, then towards the flank and rear parapets. Pack the dirt down hard. Remove any fresh dirt away from the position so it does not indicate recent excavation activity.    2.5.2.6. Grenade Sumps. Grenade sumps are constructed at each end of the two-person deliberate fighting position (Figure 2.13). This allows the blast to go straight up while occupants move to the opposite end of the position. The floor  should  be  sloped  towards  the  grenade  sumps  on  each  end  to  make  it easier to kick the grenade into the sump.  Figure 2.13. Grenade Sumps – Two-Person Deliberate Fighting Position.    \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 412.5.2.7. Additional Considerations. Conduct field soil sampling and deter-mine if revetments or some type of reinforcement is needed. Procedures for conducting soil sampling in the field can be found in Attachment 3. Also, determine  if  trenches  must  be  constructed  to provide  additional  cover from direct fire. To construct trenches and revetments, follow the same procedures described for one-person deliberate fighting positions.  2.5.2.8.  Overhead  Cover.  Employ  the  same  techniques  used  to  construct overhead cover for the one-person fighting position. Avoid digging grenade sumps  under  overhead  cover,  especially  if  overhead  cover  is  constructed across  the  middle  of  the  structure.  The  blast  could  not  only  reflect  off  the cover, but it could also collapse the structure.  2.5.2.9. Camouflage and Concealment.  Employ  the  same  camouflage  and concealment techniques as those for one-person deliberate fighting positions.     2.5.2.10. Modified Two-Person Deliberate Fighting Position. When fight-ing positions are designated to provide cover for adjacent fighting positions  or to cover dead space in close terrain, rectangular-shaped fighting positions can be modified to provide a wider sector of fire by extending one or both ends of the fighting position at an angle of about 45 degrees. Figure 2.14 and Figure  2.15  illustrate  how  two-person  deliberate  fighting  positions  can  be constructed with a rectangular shape for typical sectors of fire and modified (curved)  to  provide  a  larger  area  of  coverage.  Curving  the  hole  around  the frontal cover may be necessary in close terrain for better observation and fir-ing to the front and to the next flank position. A curved fighting position al-lows one person to maintain watch to the front while the other person rests or eats. It also enables occupants to observe and fire to the front when not being fired at, and to move back behind the frontal cover under heavy fire.        \f",

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 432.5.3. Machine Gun Fighting Position. The machine gun fighting position is basically a two-person fighting position with some differences. It is outlined as  a  T-shaped  fighting  position  with  two  firing  platforms  to  cover  primary and  secondary  sectors  of  fire  (Figure  2.16).  Due  to  the  gun’s  vibrations, sandbags  may  be  needed  to  line  the  floor  of  the  platform  and  stabilize  the tripod legs to prevent them from moving. Also, the walls of the platform may need to be reveted. Excavate to armpit depth and use the soil to build frontal, flank,  and  rear  parapets.  Dig  two  grenade  sumps  and  build  overhead  cover similar to that of a two-person fighting position. For this type of position, the ammunition bearer can dig a one-person fighting position to the flank of the gun position, essentially modifying the position into a three-person fighting position. The ammunition bearer should be able to see and fire to the front and oblique and also to cover the front of the machine gun. The ammunition bearer's position is connected to the machine gun position by a crawl trench that allows the ammunition bearer to bring ammunition to the gun or replace the gunner or assistant gunner (see Figure 2.17 and Figure 2.18). A three-person machine gun fighting position has several advantages; (1) there is a leader  in  each  position,  enabling  more  effective  command  and  control,  (2) this type of position allows for 360-degree observation and fields of fire, and (3) with three occupants, one person can provide security; one can do priority work; and one can rest, eat, or perform needed maintenance.  Also, this type of position is more difficult to suppress since it is occupied by three fighters.    Figure 2.16. Basic Machine Gun Fighting Position.     \f",

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 452.5.4. Modified Machine Gun Fighting Positions. When only one sector of fire is assigned for a machine gun, only one half of a position is dug, usually L-shaped (Figure 2.19). Time permitting, this position should be improved into  a  T-shaped  position.  Another  option  is  the  horseshoe-shaped  position (Figure 2.20). Although the horseshoe-shaped position allows for easy 180-degree traverse across the front, it provides less frontal cover and less protec-tion  from  indirect  fire  than  the  T-shaped  position.  For  this  reason,  the  T-shaped position is usually preferred.       Figure 2.19. L-Shaped Machine Gun Fighting Position.  Figure 2.20. Horseshoe-Shaped Machine Gun Fighting Position.    \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 462.5.5. Mortar Position. Civil engineers may be tasked to assist in construct-ing  mortar  positions  needed  to  defend  military  sites  (Figure  2.21).  These positions are constructed in a circular fashion and sized based on the weapon system to be employed. Typically, mortar positions are 6 to 8 feet in diameter at the bottom, about 5 feet deep, and have a 20-inch high berm for protection against enemy fire. These fighting positions must be dug deep enough to pro-tect  the  occupants  and  weapons  being  employed  without  restricting  direct lines of sight towards the enemy. The walls should be sloped outwards and reveted with sandbags or some other type of structural material to prevent the position from collapsing after repeated launch concussions. The upper diame-ter of the position can be 9 to 12 feet. Some mortar positions may not have overhead cover because of the weapon being employed, making it difficult to apply camouflage. A trench system is used for entry, and a separate position is excavated to protect the crew from enemy fire. The trench leads from the back of the mortar position away from the direction of fire, and extends for a short distance back from the position and turns at a 90-degree angle into an access trench to a covered position. The entrance trench should be reinforced to prevent collapse. Since there is no overhead cover, a drainage sump can be constructed near the entrance. Slope the floor towards the sump. This sump can also be used as a grenade sump.   Figure 2.21. Mortar Position.    \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 472.5.6.  Light  Antitank  Weapon  (LAW)  Fighting  Position.  Although  the LAW can be fired from other fighting positions, it is best to construct a dedi-cated LAW fighting position that is located and designed to accommodate the backblast from the weapon (Figure 2.22). Site the position such that the area to  the  rear  of  the  firing  area  is  away  from  trees,  walls,  parapets,  or  loose gravel that could deflect the backblast or blow debris from the backblast to-ward  other  fighting  positions  and  personnel.  The  LAW  fighting  position should be about the size of a large, straight two-person fighting position and have overhead cover located at one end of the fighting position. At the other end of the fighting position, the LAW gunner position may have a small plat-form for elbow rests cut into the top of the wall; the front face of the position should be inclined forward for better stability. If frontal protection is needed at the gunner's position, it should be minimal and stabilized. If there is raised rear protection, it must be low enough to ensure that the blast is not diverted toward another fighting position or back at the gunner. Also, make sure the rear wall of the fighting position is not too high for the LAW’s full range of fire. This could cause the blast to become entrapped in the fighting position for elevated shots. Locate grenade sumps at both ends of the position.  Figure 2.22. Light Antitank Weapon (LAW) Fighting Position.    \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 482.5.7.  Aboveground  Fighting  Positions.  Effective  aboveground  fighting positions  can  be  constructed  using  earth-filled  wire  mesh  containers.  Some container units are made from a steel mesh framework lined with non-woven geotextile  material.  Their  advantage  over  other  forms  of  protective  works includes their lightweight characteristics. They can be transported in a com-pressed,  “accordion”  style,  then  expanded  on-site  and  filled  with  locally available material (Figure 2.23) such as rocks, rubble, sand, gravel, or soil. This is extremely important from a logistical standpoint. The following para-graphs describe how these units can be used to construct a small aboveground fighting  position.  These  types  of  containers  can  also  be  used  to  construct other  types  of  protective  structures,  bunkers,  and  revetments.  Bunker  con-struction is covered in Chapter 3, and revetment construction is covered in Chapter 5. For details on constructing different types of structures using wire mesh container units, refer to the manufacturer’s instructions, the JFOB Force Protection Handbook or the JCOB Force Protection Handbook. In addition, detailed construction drawings and instructions on building a variety of pro-tective structures using earth-filled protective barrier can be downloaded from TCMS. During planning, civil engineer planners should gain access to this site  and  download  the  construction  schematics  and  instructions  needed  to implement effective FP measures immediately upon arrival.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 492.5.7.1. Site Selection and Preparation. Site  selection and preparation  are critical to the performance of structures built using wire mesh containers. Soil conditions and drainage patterns must be considered when siting these struc-tures.  Factors  that  influence  deterioration  of  near-surface  materials  are  ele-vated moisture levels, soil erosion, freeze/thaw cycles, decay of organic mat-ter, and compression of weak soils. Wire mesh container structures transmit their loads through the “fill walls” into the foundation below. The foundation needs to be stable enough to absorb these loads. The site should be flat and level  with  sufficient  strength  and  stability  to  support  the  structure  for  the amount  of  time  it  is  needed.  If  a  structure  cannot  be  sited  on  an  improved surface such as concrete, asphalt, or stabilized soil, the area should be graded to remove excess materials and loose surface soils to provide a smooth and level surface to prevent the structure from settling and shifting over time. To improve the surface area, dig a trench, approximately 20 inches beneath each wall of the structure (Figure 2.24). The width of the trench should extend 20 inches beyond the edge of each wall. Line the trench with a geotextile cloth (minimum weight 200 g/m2) and backfill it with a well compacted layer of coarse graded fill material or crushed rock. Test the foundation for strength and stability before starting any type of construction.  Figure 2.24. Improved Foundation.      \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 502.5.7.2. Materials. Civil engineer planners must work closely with the servic-ing logistics function to ensure the required materials are ordered and will be available when needed. In addition, heavy equipment, such as bulldozers and front-end  loaders,  and  hand  tools  (i.e.,  shovels,  rakes,  pliers,  wire  cutters, etc.) will be needed. As an example, the next few paragraphs describe how to construct an aboveground single-bay fighting position. NOTE: Always refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for proper construction procedures.       2.5.7.3. Single-Bay Fighting Position. To construct an aboveground single-bay fighting position using earth-filled containers, begin expanding the bays of the containers and laying out the framework (Figure 2.5) and connecting the joining pins. Make sure the flaps at the bottom of the units are folded out. Once these actions are completed, begin placing fill material in the center of the bays uniformly throughout the first layer. Generally, the bays are filled in lifts no greater than 9 inches and lightly compacted using manual hand tam-pers or by foot – do not use compacting equipment for this purpose. The bays should bulge along the sides while filling. This allows them to deform to their maximum state. Do not attempt to use restraints to prevent this deformation process.  To  accommodate  deformation,  pull  the  coil  hinges  located  at  the bottom  of  the  bays  out  approximately  4  inches  during  initial  filling.  If  the containers being used do not have coil hinges at the bottom of the bays, just pull the sides of each bay outwards. Since the example being used here in-volves  constructing  an  aboveground  single-bay  fighting  position,  a  second layer will be constructed on top of the first layer. When a second layer is to be constructed, halt filling approximately 4 inches from the top of each bay. Figure 2.25. First Layer – Single-Bay Fighting Position.   \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 512.5.7.4.  Second  Layer.  After  the  first  layer  is  complete,  align  the  second layer as depicted in Figure 2.26. Seal both layers together using the geotex-tile flaps located at the bottom of the second layer and use the plastic ties to connect them. Uniformly fill the second layer as previously described. Figure 2.26. Second Layer – Single-Bay Fighting Position. 2.5.7.5. Composite Panels. Align the 2- by 14-foot composite panels on top of the second layer of earth-filled units along the vertical walls as shown in Figure 2.27. Figure 2.27.

Drive the toggle connectors in as far as possible, cut them flush, then place the wa-terproof membrane on top of the roof as illustrated in Figure 2.28. Figure 2.28. Waterproof Membrane – Single-Bay Fighting Position.  2.5.7.7. Overhead Cover. Constructing overhead cover is the last step. Begin by  aligning  sections  of  containers  along  the  roof  as  shown  in Figure 2.29. Ensure the flaps at the bottom of the units are folded in. Fill the bays as pre-viously described and lightly compact.  After all of the bays are filled, place approximately  2  feet  of  fill  material  in  the  center  of  the  roof  to  complete overhead cover (Figure 2.30). Once completed, check to make sure there is no  excessive  deflection  of  the  roof  (up  to  1½  inches  is  acceptable).  Also, make sure the roof supports are centered on the sidewalls and sheet pilings are fully supported by the roof supports. Lastly, check to make sure all walls are straight and that there is no excessive settlement of the walls.       \f",

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 54Chapter 3 PROTECTIVE STRUCTURES 3.1.  Overview.  This  chapter  covers  different  types  of  bunkers  and  shelters that can be employed in the expeditionary environment (Figure 3.1). Bunkers and shelters should be designed to withstand near misses or direct hits from rockets,  artillery,  and  mortars  and  strategically  located  throughout  the  site. The types of protective shelters employed during contingencies are based on many  factors  including:  (1)  the  threat,  (2)  stage  of  the  deployment,  (3)  in-tended use of the structure, (4) available materials, (5) available equipment, (6) available man-hours, and (7) construction skills. During initial beddown, engineers must focus immediately upon designing and constructing protective shelters  needed  to  counter  known  and  potential  threats.  Initially,  expedient methods will likely be required. However, as contingency operations begin to stabilize and access to additional resources become available, engineers must focus  on  improving  designs  and  constructing  protective  shelters  that  afford more  protection  for  personnel  and  mission-critical  assets.    While  planning, keep in mind that the best protective shelters are those that provide the most protection and require the least amount of time and effort to construct.   Figure 3.1. Protective Structures.     \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 553.2. Expedient Protective Structures. When designing bunkers and shelters, consider the purpose (e.g., command post, observation post) and the degree of protection desired (small arms, mortars, bombs). These structures should be sited and constructed out of the path of natural drainage lines. If possible, site shelters on reverse slopes, in wooded areas, or in some form of natural fortifi-cation such as a ravine, valley, gully, hollow or depression for added protec-tion. NOTE: Reverse slopes of hills and mountains also provide some protec-tion  from  the  effects  of  nuclear  weapons  since  the  heat  and  light  from  the fireball of a nuclear blast and the initial radiation tend to be absorbed by hills and  mountains.  For  additional  information  on  NBC  protection,  refer  to AFTTP  (I)  3-2.46.  Once  constructed,  continuously  improve  the  protective capability of bunkers and shelters as time permits. The following paragraphs outline key factors to be considered when designing and constructing expedi-ent protective structures.  3.2.1. Overhead Protection for Expedient Protective Structures. Expedi-ent shelters should have some type of overhead cover. Although it may not be possible  to  provide  overhead  cover  for  every  asset,  fighting  positions  and mission-critical assets deemed vulnerable to certain threats must be provided appropriate levels of protection. Overhead cover can be constructed from  a combination of berms, revetments, or partially buried structures if engineers are not limited by the lack of time or resources. During the initial stages of a deployment, however, it is very likely that time and resources will be limited. This is why it is very important that civil engineers focus initially on defeat-ing  specific  threats  (e.g.,  direct-  and  indirect-fired  weapons)  and  protecting the  most  critical  assets,  rather  than  attempting  to  equally  protect  all  assets from all possible threats. See Attachment 2 for a list of the different types of materials that may be available in the expeditionary environment for use in constructing overhead cover to protect against various projectiles.       \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 563.2.2. Corrugated Metal Culvert Shelter. Aboveground metal culvert shel-ters can be constructed in areas where personnel are billeted or work in non-protected buildings or expeditionary structures and need shelter in the event of an attack (Figure 3.2). Covered with earth (18 to 24 inches), these struc-tures can provide a significant amount of protection. However, do not to use the  top  of  these  types  of  structures  to  support  overhead  cover  without  first reinforcing the base of the structure. Use lumber, timber, berms, revetments, or other expedient means of supporting the overhead cover. The shelter is 6 feet  high  and  consists  of  two  rows  of  55-gallon  drums  with  about  a  4-foot span between rows.  Two- by four-inch studs measuring 4 inches higher than the drums are centered inside each drum. The drums are then filled with soil. A  2-  by  8-inch  top  plate  is  connected  to  the  2-  by  4-inch  studs  lengthwise through the bunker. The corrugated metal pipe halves are bolted together and connected to the top plates. A 2-foot layer of sandbags is placed along each row of drums.  To protect  the  ends  of the bunker,  erect barrier walls  2  feet beyond the entrances. Additional protection is provided on the sides and ends by  increasing  sandbag  thickness.  This  shelter  provides  protection  against mortars and small caliber weapons. Figure 3.2. Corrugated Metal Culvert Shelter.   \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 573.2.3.  Fighting  Bunker  With  Overhead  Cover.  It  is  impractical  to  place enough earth cover on a structure to protect it against all weapons. However, by combining materials and using them in layers, protection is provided with less  excavation  and  effort.  The  designs  illustrated  in  Figure  3.3  through Figure 3.5 use five 2-inch or seven 1-inch layers of lumber as the base sup-port for the roof. Layers of materials are placed on the base in sequence to provide overhead protection. Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 contain a bill of mate-rials and required stringer thickness based on the thickness of earth cover for this design. These different layers are described in the following paragraphs.  3.2.3.1. Dust-Proof Layer. Tar paper, canvas, or tarpaulins are lapped and placed on top of the base of the roof to keep out dust and dirt.  3.2.3.2. Cushion layer. The cushion layer is intended to absorb the shock of detonation or  penetration.  Untamped  earth  is  the  best  material  for  this  pur-pose and should be at least  12 inches thick. Materials such as loose gravel transmit shock to the layer below and should not be used in the cushion layer. This layer extends on all sides for a distance equal to the depth of the shelter floor below the ground surface, or to a minimum of 5 feet.  3.2.3.3. Waterproof Layer. The waterproof layer is constructed of the same or  similar  materials  as  the  dust-proof  layer.  It  is  intended  to  keep  moisture from the cushion layer in order to retain the cushioning effect of the soft, dry earth and minimize the dead load the structure must carry.  3.2.3.4. Burster Layer. The burster layer is intended to cause a projectile to detonate before it can penetrate into the lower layers. This layer is made of 6 to 8 inches of rocks placed in two layers with the joints broken. It should be at  least  12  inches  thick.  Irregular-shaped  rocks  are  more  effective  for  this purpose than flat rocks because they can change a projectile’s angle of pene-tration.  If  rocks  are  not  available,  8-inch  logs  can  be  used.  They  must  be wired tightly together in two layers. The burster layer should extend on each side of the shelter a minimum of 6 feet. Lastly, cover the burster layer with two inches of untamped earth or sod as a camouflage layer.   \f",

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 613.3. Prefabricated Structures. Prefabricated structures provide a rapid con-struction  and  placement  capability.  The  most  commonly  used  prefabricated structures are the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) shel-ters and ISO shipping containers.  3.3.1. Expandable Tactical ISO Shelters. ISO shelters (Figure 3.6) are not as vulnerable to blast and fragmentation as tents and provide highly mobile, environmentally  controlled  space  for  a  variety  of  field  activities.  Several models  are  available,  including  non-expandable,  one-side  expandable,  and two-side expandable models. Tactical shelters are wired for 60 or 100 amp, three-phase electrical distribution and are integrated with internal fluorescent lights, 120 VAC, 20 amp electrical outlets, an external area light, and an in-terface  for  external  environmental  control  units.  Although  research  is  con-stantly being conducted to develop designs that are capable of resisting the effects  of  blast  and  fragmentation,  tactical  shelters  can  be  hardened  with sandbags, revetments, berms, concrete barriers, or other methods to provide some degree of protection. For additional details on the use of tactical shel-ters, refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 6. DOD also established a Joint Commit-tee  on  Tactical  Shelters  (JOCATAS)  to  prevent  the  duplication  of  tactical shelter  research  and  development  amongst  the  services.  JOCATAS  is  also responsible  for  approving  the  DOD  Standard  Family  of  Tactical  Shelters.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 623.3.2. ISO Bunkers. ISO bunkers are constructed using ISO containers hard-ened  with  earth-filled  protective  barriers  (Figure  3.7).  The  following  para-graphs briefly describe construction of an ISO bunker. There are several dif-ferent types of bunkers that can be constructed using earth-filled containers. For  additional  information  on  ISO  bunkers  and  other  types  of  bunkers  that can be constructed using ISO containers, refer to the manufacturer’s instruc-tions and TCMS. The next few paragraphs describe construction of an above-ground 20-foot ISO bunker. NOTE: When building these types of bunkers, keep  in  mind  the  ISO  containers  cannot  be  load-bearing  structures.  Steel framing or other structural support approved by an engineer with experience in structural analysis must be used to support the top cover. Before attempting to construct this bunker, planners must ensure the resources are available to complete all phases of the project. These resources include bunker kits; heavy equipment  such  as  bulldozers,  vibratory  rollers,  dump  trucks,  cranes,  fork-lifts, and front-end loaders; and technical guidance. Once a site is selected, follow  the  guidance  in  Chapter  2  for  site  selection  and  preparation.  Con-struction can begin once planners are satisfied all resource requirements have been met. Figure 3.7. ISO Bunker.                                                                                Earth-Filled Containers                                            ISO Container      \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 633.3.2.1. First Layer. The first layer of wire mesh containers for the ISO bun-ker requires three sections of containers equal to nine bays. Begin by collaps-ing  one  of  the  nine-bay  sections  to  make  a  section  that  is  eight  bays  long. Next,  break  down  another  nine-bay  section  into  two  units  with  four  bays each. Align the bays as illustrated in Figure 3.8, ensuring the flaps at the bot-tom of the units are folded out. Once the layout is complete, begin filling the units in 9-inch lifts (approximately). Start from the center of the bays and fill the bays in a uniform manner, ensuring some bays are not being filled faster than  others.  Lightly  compact  the  fill  material  after  each  lift  using  manual hand tampers or by foot – do not use compacting equipment for this purpose. Continue this process until all bays are filled. Compact the last layer in prepa-ration to construct the second layer of the ISO bunker. For more guidance on infill  procedures,  refer  to  Chapter  2,  the  manufacturer’s  instructions,  or TCMS.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 643.3.2.2.  Second  Layer.  The  second  layer  of  the  ISO  bunker  also  requires three  sections  of  containers  (nine  bays  per  section).  Note  that  the  material needed  to  construct  the  second  layer  is  identical  to  the  material  needed  to construct the base layout. This is because the second layer must be perfectly aligned with the first layer. Once again, begin by collapsing one of the three sections  (nine bays)  to  make  a  section  that  equates  to  eight  bays.  Take  an-other section (nine bays) and separate it into two separate sections consisting of four bays. Align these sections as illustrated in Figure 3.9, ensuring the flaps at the bottom are folded out. Once the layout is complete for the second layer, connect the plastic ties between the first and second layers, and begin filling the units using the proper fill procedures previously described.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 653.3.2.3. Roof Support. Once the second layer is complete, begin preparing the roof support.  To support the roof structure, four 18-foot, U-shaped sheet pilings are required.  Place two pieces of the sheet pilings end-to-end on top of each of the sidewalls of the structure as illustrated in Figure 3.10. Ensure the panels are centered on the sidewalls. Other materials such as 6- by 6-inch lumber can be used in lieu of sheet pilings for roof support if approved by an engineer  with  experience  in  structural  analysis.  This  structure  will  be  de-pended upon to shield personnel from attacks, and its structural integrity can-not be overemphasized.  For this reason, any tendency to improvise materials or procedures during construction should be avoided.    Figure 3.10. Roof Support — ISO Bunker.          \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 663.3.2.4.  Sheet  Piling  and  Waterproof  Membrane.  Once  the  sheet  pilings are firmly in place along the sidewalls, 24 18-foot U-shaped sheet pilings are laid across the structure, firmly on top of the roof supports as illustrated in Figure 3.11. When placing the sheet pilings, slide the pieces together from the ends to lock them in place. Again, any attempts to improvise should be avoided,  and  any  material  substitution  should  be  approved  by  an  engineer with  experience  in  structural  analysis.  Once  the  sheet  pilings  are  in  place across the structure, the waterproof membrane can be placed on top of them. Sandbags can then be placed on top of the waterproof membrane to level the roof (Figure 3.12). Figure 3.11. Sheet Piling – ISO Bunker.    Figure 3.12. Waterproof Membrane – ISO Bunker.    \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 673.3.2.5. Overhead Cover. After installing the waterproof membrane, the next step is to put the overhead cover in place. This requires 24 sections of con-tainers, 2 feet high, 2 feet wide, and 4 feet long. Place the units as illustrated in Figure 3.13, making sure the sandbags are beneath the edges of the units to prevent soil from leaking through and on to roof. Fill each unit with loose soil and lightly compact. Once this is complete, place approximately 2 feet of soil in the center of the roof. Once this is completed, refer to Table 3.3 and do a quick visual check to make sure the structure is intact.  Figure 3.13. Overhead Cover – ISO Bunker.   Table 3.3.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 683.4.  Reinforced  Concrete  Bunkers.  Reinforced  concrete  bunkers  are  used extensively  in  the  expeditionary  environment  to  provide  immediate  shelter from  imminent  or  repeated  attacks.  Figure  3.14  shows  reinforced  concrete culvert bunkers commonly found in SWA and a different type of reinforced concrete bunker developed by the USACE’s Engineer Research and Devel-opment Center (ERDC). The entrances of reinforced concrete culvert bunkers can be blocked by concrete barriers, additional sandbags, or some other bar-rier to prevent the effects of blasts and fragmentation from entering the struc-ture. The ERDC bunker is designed to eliminate a direct line of entrance for blast and fragmentation into the structures. These structures are usually de-signed to accommodate 25 to 30 personnel and can be placed above or below the ground (based on the threat). It is important to note that these bunkers are not effective against direct hits from 120 mm mortars and 122 mm rockets.  Therefore, these bunkers should be fully buried in a cut and cover configura-tion or covered by several layers of sandbags. Cover the roof of the bunkers with 2 to 3 layers of sandbags for protection against quick-fused 82 mm and 120 mm mortars. Cover bunkers with approximately 48 inches of sandbags or bury them with approximately 48 inches of soil cover for protection against quick-fused 122 mm rockets. Place at least layers of sandbags along the bun-ker walls for protection against blast and fragmentation effects of near-miss (4 feet) hits from 82 mm and 120 mm mortars and 122 mm rockets. Rein-forced concrete bunkers can be manufactured locally or acquired through the Logistics  Support  function.  For  additional  information  on  these  and  other types  of  bunkers,  obtain  access  to  TCMS.  The  ERDC  should  also  be  con-tacted  at  www.erdc.usace.army.mil  for  the  latest  designs  since  these  struc-tures are constantly being tested and improved.        \f",

Obstacles,  from  a  tactical  military  perspective,  can  be  de-scribed as any obstructions designed and employed to impede, oppose, block, or disrupt the movement or intentions of an opposing force. They can exist naturally,  be  expediently  constructed,  or  be  prefabricated  and  moved  into place when and where needed. While the employment of obstacles can have significant advantages, constructing them can be labor-intensive, and they can inhibit the movement of both enemy and friendly forces. For this reason, ob-stacles must be employed with a clear goal and understanding. This chapter covers  many  types  of  obstacles  that  can  be  employed  in  the  expeditionary environment to protect assets and enhance force protection efforts. For addi-tional details, refer to MIL-HDBK-1013/10, Design Guidelines for Security Fencing, Gates, Barriers, and Guard Facilities, and UFC 4-022-02.  4.2. Planning. Responsibility for developing a plan for using obstacles, the barrier plan, normally rests with civil engineers and security forces. The plan outlines how obstacles will be employed continuously and during periods of heightened  alert.  A  prioritized  list  of  key  facilities  and  critical  assets  to  be protected is used to develop the plan. Civil engineers work closely with secu-rity personnel to identify resources needed to adequately protect key facilities and assets. Although some installations may preposition these assets and em-ploy  them  upon  heightened  alert  or  increased  threats,  in  the  expeditionary environment,  limited  resources  may  not  allow  for  maintaining  barriers  in storage or prepositioned status for heightened alert.  Barriers may need to be employed  where  needed  continuously  to  provide  protection  in  high  threat environments.  This  determination  is  made  on-site.  The  barrier  plan  should summarize the number and types of barriers employed as well as additional requirements,  employment  locations,  if  and  where  barriers  will  be  preposi-tioned,  their  intended  purpose  (i.e.,  traffic  control,  perimeter  security,  etc.), and resources and equipment needed to move or relocate and install the barri-ers when needed (i.e., anchors, cables, forklift, trailer, etc.). A dedicated bar-rier team should be appointed, trained, and exercised regularly.  \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 714.3. Natural Obstacles. Natural obstacles can include steep slopes, escarp-ments,  ravines,  gullies,  ditches,  rivers,  streams,  canals,  swamps,  marshes, snow,  and  trees  (see  Table  4.1).  Trees  between  6  to  8  inches  in  diameter, dense shrubs, and other vegetation can be used to enhance efforts to restrict access to military sites. If complemented with other forms of barriers such as barbed  or  concertina  wire  (Figure  4.1),  trees  and  dense  vegetation  can  be used to enhance standoff. Barbed wire can be run low (9 to 30 inches above the ground) in tall grass, shrubs, or brush and anchored on small pickets or draped through shrubs to cause tripping hazards and injury to enemy person-nel attempting to encroach upon a military site. Dense trees and shrubs can also obscure direct lines of sight to a location and decrease the enemy’s tar-geting capability. Keep in mind a clear zone must always be maintained to prevent  enemy  personnel  from  advancing  too  close  to  the  site’s  perimeter.  There are some disadvantages of using trees and shrubs for the purposes just covered. In some regions, trees and shrubs can be labor-intensive to maintain.  Also, these natural barriers can be used by the enemy as cover while attempt-ing  to  breach  protective  barriers.  An  analysis  will  have  to  be  conducted  to determine if trees and vegetation can be used to enhance force protection ef-forts,  or  whether  these  areas  will  have  to  be  cleared  to  prevent  the  enemy from gaining an advantage in efforts to breach security measures.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 72Table 4.1. Description of Natural Obstacles. DESCRIPTION Steep slopes, particularly those with ruts, brush, and felled trees, can stop movement of different types of vehicles.  Vertical  or  near-vertical  1  1/2-meter  high  cuts  in slopes or walls can be used to stop vehicles. Thick rock  walls,  railroad  embankments,  and  steep  fills along  highways  are  examples  of  escarpments  that can be used. These  obstacles  can  stop  most  wheeled  vehicles.  However, they should be over 5 meters wide to be effective against tracked vehicles. To overcome rivers, streams, and canals, an enemy force must find a fordable shallow crossing, rely on special means for deep water fording, or find an ele-vated crossing. The width and depth of the water, the water  velocity,  and  the  condition  of  the  banks  and the bottom of the water determine the ease of cross-ing by shallow or deepwater fording. These natural barriers are effective obstacles to mo-bility. They can stop personnel and all types of vehi-cles when there is either no firm ground or the sub-merged ground is more than a meter below the water surface. Snow over one meter in depth can be a major obsta-cle for personnel and vehicles. Heavy  stands  of  trees,  eight  or  more  inches  in  di-ameter and spaced less than 20 feet apart will build up into an obstacle when tracked vehicles attempt to push them over and force their way through.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 734.4. Field Expedient Obstacles. During initial beddown it may be necessary to use whatever means available to construct obstacles for protection. How-ever, once material and equipment are more readily available, these measures should be complemented or replaced with more effective means of protection.  The  following  paragraphs  describe  expedient  methods  that  can  be  used  to construct and employ obstacles when time and materials are limited.  4.4.1. Abatis. During initial beddown, trees can be used to construct an aba-tis, one of the oldest forms of barriers (Figure 4.2). The term “abatis” is a French word meaning “a heap of material thrown.” It is constructed by cut-ting down trees, leaving them attached to the stump, and arranging them in a row with the branches facing towards the direction of the enemy to impede movement. To ensure the tree remains attached to the stump, cut the butt of the tree two-thirds through on the opposite side to which it is to fall. The trees are then forcefully pushed over in the required direction. The branches can be sharpened, making the barrier a primitive version of barbed wire. To be even more effective, tree branches can be interlaced with barbed wire if available.  Although  this  type  of  expedient  barrier  may  be  necessary  during  the  early stages  of  a  contingency  due  to  severely  limited  resources,  it  should  not  be used as a permanent barrier for a deployed site unless combined with more modern forms of obstacles to enhance the level of protection.  Figure 4.2. Abatis.    \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 744.4.2. Log Obstacles. During initial beddown, logs can be used to construct different types of obstacles and expedient barriers. The following paragraphs describe  some  of  the  different  ways  logs  can  be  used  to  restrict  movement around and throughout a deployed location. These are considered temporary measures.  Once  contingency  operations  begin  to  stabilize  and  material  and equipment  are  more  readily  available  (locally  or  through  supply  channels), these types of barriers should be complemented or replaced with more effec-tive  means  of  impeding,  blocking,  or  disrupting  movement.  Some  of  these methods will be covered later in this chapter.   4.4.2.1. Log or Lumber Wall. A log wall, as illustrated in Figure 4.3, can be constructed to block access to certain areas or to protect critical assets. This type of barrier construction consists of short sections of 4- to 6-inch logs or lumber stacked together between posts of the same size as the wall sections.  The posts are fastened together at the top and further held in place by guy wires or ropes fastened to stakes. Several 10- to 12-foot wall sections should be constructed toward the front of the position and placed in a staggered fash-ion rather than building one long wall which could be destroyed by a single detonation from enemy weapons. Figure 4.3. Log Wall.   \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 754.4.2.2. Log Hurdles. Log hurdles are used to form barriers approximately 18 inches high across a road. Individual logs may be as small as 10 inches in diameter if they are lashed or wired together and staked in place. Once log hurdles are wired together, stagger shorter logs (6- to 7-foot lengths) along the path in 10 to 12-foot segments, and place full width logs as illustrated in Figure 4.4. Hurdles can slow vehicles enough to allow security forces to en-gage an intruder or cause a vehicle to lose control. For more effectiveness, hurdles can be used in conjunction with other obstacles such as ditches and log cribs. Figure 4.4. Log Hurdles.      \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 764.4.2.3.  Log  Cribs.  Log  cribs  are  simple  obstacles  consisting  of  short  sec-tions of logs (or other materials such as steel planks if available) fashioned together as bins to contain dirt or rocks. Log cribs can be rectangular or trian-gular and are used to block vehicle paths of travel on narrow roads (Figure 4.5). When possible, fill the cribs with material excavated by digging a shal-low ditch in front of the cribs. Anchor revetment materials to prevent them from being easily pushed out of the way. These obstacles are effective against wheeled and tracked vehicles, especially in restricted areas like narrow moun-tain roads. Unless substantially built, these types of obstacles are not effective against heavy tracked vehicles. To make these obstacles more effective, log hurdles can be constructed ahead of the cribs to force vehicles to slow down prior to encountering them. Figure 4.5. Log Cribs.     \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 774.4.3.  Expedient  Posts.  The  next  few  paragraphs  cover  different  types  of posts that can be used to block access roads either permanently or temporar-ily.  The  method  used  will  depend  on  many  factors,  including  the  need  for access by friendly forces, the threat, availability of equipment and materials, and the need to maintain an active offensive and defensive capability.  4.4.3.1. Timber Posts. Timber posts can be used to stop vehicles if partially buried and driven into the soil at an angle between vertical and 50 degrees toward  the  direction  of  movement  (Figure  4.6).  The  posts  should  be  ap-proximately  10  feet  long  and  extend  3  1/2  to  4  feet  aboveground.  Set  the posts between 3 to 4 feet apart in rows with 10 feet between rows. They can be either aligned or staggered. Logs should be a minimum of 5 inches in di-ameter for hardwoods and about 10 inches in diameter for softwoods. Wire entanglements  can  be  used  in  conjunction  with  this  measure  for  increased effectiveness. Figure 4.6. Timber Posts.        \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 784.4.3.2. Steel Angled Posts. Steel pipes can be used as posts to block road-ways  and  entrances.  The  pipes  should  be  approximately  6  feet  long  and  4 inches  in  diameter.  They  are  spaced  approximately  4  feet  apart  and  driven into the surface approximately 3 feet at an angle between 30 to 45 degrees.  The post holes can then be backfilled with either soil or concrete to increase their strength. Vehicles attempting to penetrate these types of barriers at high speeds will experience major damage, and occupants will more than likely be severely injured. Steel angled posts can be installed parallel or perpendicular to  a  roadway.  To  prevent  access  by  individuals  on  motorcycles,  drill  holes into the top of each post and thread ½-inch diameter steel wire cable through each post as indicated in Figure 4.7.  Figure 4.7. Steel Angled Posts.           \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 794.4.4.  Berms  and  Ditches.  Civil  engineers  should  include  expedient  con-struction of shallow berms and ditches while planning beddown activities for deployments (Figure 4.8). Constructing these terrain features around the pe-rimeter of a deployed location will slow or prevent vehicles from penetrating the restricted boundary. It is important to remember that these features should be gradual and shallow. Shallow berms and ditches make it more difficult for speeding vehicles to avoid and provide less cover for intruders attempting to infiltrate  the  area.  While  planning,  consider  the  different  types  of  heavy equipment that will be required to construct berms and ditches.  4.4.4.1. Triangular Ditches and Hillside Cuts. Triangular ditches and hill-side cuts are relatively easy to construct and are very effective against a wide range of vehicles. Hillside cuts are variations of the triangular ditch adapted to hillside locations. These terrain structures may need to be reveted to pre-vent them from being easily filled or collapsed. Constructing additional ob-stacles, such as log hurdles (protected side) to complement these structures ,will  make  them  more  effective  in  slowing  and  stopping  vehicles  (Figure 4.9).  When placed at blind curves or hilltop transitions, log hurdles or spoil mounds can cause speeding vehicles to go out of control.  4.4.4.2.  Trapezoidal  Ditch.  A  trapezoidal  ditch  requires  more  construction time, but is more effective in stopping vehicles. With this type of construc-tion, a vehicle will be trapped when the front end falls into the ditch and the undercarriage is hung up on the leading edge of the ditch.  4.4.4.3.  Berms.  Berms  are  very  effective  in  reinforcing  existing  perimeter structures and stopping vehicles, and are relatively easy to construct. How-ever,  this  task  can  also  be  time-consuming,  and  engineers  need  to  ensure heavy equipment will be available to construct berms immediately upon arri-val to the deployed location.       \f",

Field expedient methods for constructing ob-stacles  such  as  log  cribs  can  be  very  effective  and  necessary,  particularly when a unit is on the move or simply does not have access to other types of materials.  However,  these  methods  can  be  labor-intensive  and  time-consuming. If available, prefabricated materials can also be filled with earth and  used  as  obstacles.  Examples  of  some  prefabricated  objects  that  can  be used along with sand, soil, rocks, or other natural materials include wire mesh containers,  sandbags,  and 55-gallon drums  (Figure 4.10). If  available,  they can  be  earth-filled  and  used  as  obstacles  for  various  purposes  (i.e.,  block roads and entry points, establish standoff, reinforce perimeters, control vehi-cle  traffic,  etc.). In  an  austere  environment,  individuals  are  limited  only  by their  imagination  in how readily  available fill  material  can be  used  in  con-junction  with  prefabricated  structures  and  materials  to  construct  effective obstacles. In addition, some of the same structures and materials that can be used to create obstacles can also be stacked and used as revetments, which will be covered in Chapter 5.   Figure 4.10. Earth-Filled Obstacles.    \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 834.4.6.  Urban  Rubble.  In  the  urban  environment,  large  chunks  of  concrete, junked  vehicles,  and  damaged  equipment  are  a  few  examples  of  items  that can be used as obstacles (Figure 4.11). Built-up areas can naturally restrict movement due to the amount of existing structures. These areas are normally not  used  to  beddown  personnel  deployed  to  overseas  locations.  However, they may exist nearby and could be used as a staging area for enemy forces to attack  the  base.  Security  personnel  may use  these  areas as  part  of  the base defense. The use of urban rubble as obstacles can be further enhanced by cra-tering streets, demolishing walls, and overturning or derailing heavy vehicles or railroad cars. Roadblocks can be built from rubble or construction materi-als.  Barbed  wire  can  be  used  to  surround urban  rubble  for  increased  effec-tiveness as obstacles. In this environment, personnel are only limited by their imagination. Figure 4.11. Urban Rubble.      \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 844.4.7. Concertina Wire Roadblocks. When laid in depth about 11 rows deep across a roadway, strung concertina wire can be used as a roadblock (Figure 4.12). It is more effective when supported by pickets, and can also be used in conjunction with steel hedgehogs. The materials needed to construct this ob-stacle  include  11  rolls  of  concertina  wire,  one  roll  of  barbed  wire,  30  long pickets, and 22 short pickets. This material is enough to construct a concer-tina wire obstacle approximately 33 feet in depth along the roadway. For en-gineers  experienced  in  laying  concertina  wire,  this  obstacle  can  be  con-structed  in  approximately  one  hour.  Table  4.2  contains  installation  proce-dures for the concertina wire roadblock.    Figure 4.12. Concertina Wire Roadblock.       \f",

A triple-strand concertina wire fence can be a very effective obstacle. This type of fence uses three rolls of stacked concertina  wire.  One  roll  is  stacked  on  top  of  two  rolls  running  parallel  to each  other,  forming  a  pyramid.  This  obstacle  can  delay  an  intrusion  long enough  to  allow  security  forces  to  engage  the  enemy.  Table  4.3  describes installation procedures for triple-strand concertina wire fence.

The remainder of this chapter focuses on those obstacles that are usually prefabricated and moved into place as needed, and those obstacles that are not usually considered expedient due to the time and materials needed for construction.  4.5.1. Chain Link Fencing. Chain link fencing can be used to form a con-tinuous obstacle around a site. Although they are considered obstacles to pe-destrian traffic, fences are not very effective unless reinforced using cables or other methods to prevent them from being easily breached. This can be ac-complished with cable at least ¾-inch in diameter. The cable is strung at 30 inches  and  35  inches  above  the  ground  (Figure  4.15).  Fences  can  also  be used in conjunction with other security measures such as berms, earth-filled containers,  surveillance  cameras,  motion  detectors,  etc.  Once  constructed, they  should  be  inspected  frequently  to  detect  evidence  of  breaches  and  to ensure any maintenance needed is identified. For additional details on design-ing security fencing, reference MIL-HDBK-1013/10, Design Guidelines for Security Fencing, Gates, Barriers, and Guard Facilities (will be republished as UFC 4-022-03). If it is determined that fence construction should be ac-complished  via  local  contract,  the  specifications  in  UFGS-32  31  00.00  10, UFGS-32 31 13.00 20, and UFGS-32 31 13.00 40 can be used in developing the contract Performance Work Statement (PWS).

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 894.5.2. Obscuration Screens. Perimeter obscuration screens are used to block direct lines of sight to sensitive areas or facilities from outside the perimeter of a site in an effort to reduce targeting opportunities from direct-fire weap-ons.  This  can be  done  in  various ways  using  trees,  dense  vegetation,  chain link fences with slats, wooden fences, camouflage netting, etc. Obscuration screens are not usually designed or constructed to provide protection against direct  fire.  If  installed  around  facilities,  place  obscuration  screens  on  the side(s)  facing  the  site’s  perimeter  to  reduce  exposure.  Obscuration  screens can also be placed on perimeter fences to block lines of sight into the camp area  (Figure  4.16).  When  using  obscuration  screens  on  fences,  make  sure personnel inside the site or facility are still able to see outside and observe any suspicious activities. Figure 4.16. Obscuration Screen on Perimeter Fence.             \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 904.5.3.  Predetonation  Screens.  Predetonation  screens  are  used  to  detonate antitank weapons and dissipate the effects between the area where the screen is constructed and the weapons’ primary target (Figure 4.17). The screen can be constructed of wood, solid fencing material, etc. It is usually constructed between 10 to 40 feet from the structures it is intended to protect. For addi-tional information on constructing and siting predetonation screens, refer to UFC  4-020-03FA.  A predetonation  screen may  have  several  effects.  Hope-fully, it will damage the fuze on the weapon, causing it to dud. The structure being protected  must  still  be  capable  of defeating  the kinetic  energy  of  the fired  round.  The  primary  purpose  is  to  detonate  an  antitank  rocket  when  it strikes the screen. In this case, the combination of standoff distance and the construction of the protected facility must defeat the gas jet from the shaped charge.  Antitank  rounds  emit  a  concentrated  stream  of  molten  metal  upon detonation (known as shaped charge) capable of penetrating several inches of steel. The predetonation screen must cause the round to detonate far enough from  the  asset  to  mitigate  the  damage  from  the  molten  material  and  spent rocket engine.  Figure 4.17. Predetonation Screening.          \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 914.5.4. Concrete Barriers. With the exception of the Jersey barrier, most con-crete barriers currently being used throughout Southwest Asia are from 8 to 12 feet tall, 4 to 6 feet wide, weigh between 10,000 and 20,000 pounds, and are usually reinforced with steel (Figure 4.18). Tall concrete barriers, such as the Texas barrier and Alaska barrier, are being used for various reasons, in-cluding protection from the effects of blast and fragmentation. The effective-ness of these barriers depends on their thickness, height, and distance from the asset being protected. If a barrier breaks apart as a result of a detonation, the debris generated from the barrier itself becomes secondary fragmentation and can be quite lethal, offsetting efforts to reduce the effects of fragmenta-tion. When planning to deploy these types of barriers throughout the site, the civil engineer planner must consider the heavy equipment (e.g., cranes, flat-bed  trailers)  that  will  be needed  to  transport  and  maneuver  these  structures into place. Once barriers are in place, earth-filled containers or soil berms can be used to reinforce them to prevent secondary fragmentation in the event the barrier  breaks  apart  from  the  force  of  a  detonation.  Detail  drawings  of  all types of concrete barriers can be downloaded from the AFCESA AT/FP In-stallation Engineering Community of Practice at: https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-CE-A7.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 924.5.5. Vehicle Barriers. Vehicle barriers are categorized as either active or passive. Active and passive barriers can be fixed or movable, depending on how  they  are made,  operated, or used.  Some  commercial  barriers  are dual-classified when they meet the requirements for both categories (e.g., fixed-active, portable, passive). Fixed vehicle barriers are permanently installed and usually  require  heavy  equipment  to  move  or  dismantle.  Examples  include hydraulically-operated  rotation  or  retracting  systems,  pits,  and  concrete  or steel  barriers.  Portable  vehicle  barriers  are  those  barriers  that  can  be  easily relocated  if  needed.  However,  heavy  equipment  may  be  required  in  some cases to lift and transport these types of barriers. The following paragraphs briefly describe some of the types of vehicle barriers that can be used in the expeditionary environment. For details on selection and application of vehicle barriers, refer to UFC 4-022-02. In addition, a list of DOD-certified anti-ram vehicle  barriers  can  be  downloaded  from  the  USACE  PDC  website  at https://pdc.usace.army.mil. The list is updated periodically as different types of anti-ram vehicle devices are crash-tested.     4.5.5.1. Active Vehicle Barriers. Active barriers are those with moving parts that require some action, either by personnel, equipment, or both. These are mechanical  devices  used  primarily  to  block  access  by  vehicles  that  are  a potential threat. A couple of examples of active vehicle barriers are shown in Figure 4.19 and Figure 4.20. In addition to those illustrated, active barriers include retractable bollards, beams, and sliding gates. Most of these barriers will require civil engineer support for setup and installation. More permanent types  of  active  barriers  are  usually  purchased  through  supply  channels, moved  into  place  using  heavy  equipment,  and  installed  in  accordance  with the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  For  planning  purposes,  UFC  4-022-02 contains barrier performance ratings and cost data for different types of active barriers.  It  may  also  be  possible  to  obtain  contract  support  for  on-site construction of active vehicle barriers. If this option is being considered, refer to  UFGS  34  71  13.19,  Active  Vehicle  Barriers,  when  constructing performance  work  statements.

Their effectiveness relies upon their ability to absorb  energy  and  transmit  that  energy  into  the  foundation.  The  following paragraphs briefly describe some types of passive vehicle barriers.   4.5.5.2.1.  Jersey  Barriers.  Jersey  barriers  (Figure  4.21)  are  typically  em-ployed for countermobility around entry control points and approach avenues.  They can be staggered on roads to create serpentine paths, forcing drivers to slow down to negotiate curves prior to reaching the entry point. They can also be used to establish site boundaries. To be an effective vehicle barriers, they must be anchored to the surface and/or cabled together (along straight paths) to provide added strength and resistance. Figure 4.21.

In the field environments, these obstacles can be constructed of ½-inch thick steel pipe about 8 inches in diameter and 7 feet long. The pipes are filled with concrete and anchored into a 4-foot concrete footing so they pro-ject 3 feet above the ground (Figure 4.22). The pipes should be spaced no more than 4 feet apart. Fixed bollards can be placed inside or outside existing fences to channel vehicle traffic away from certain areas or prevent vehicular access into certain areas. When planning for fixed barriers such as these, sev-eral factors such as future site expansion and possible relocation of facilities and other structures should be taken into consideration. These types of activi-ties  may  require  fixed  bollards  to  be  excavated  and  reconstructed  in  other areas. Also, be careful not to place permanent barriers in areas where emer-gency response vehicles may need to gain access in the event of an attack or other emergency.         Figure 4.22.

Steel posts, such as heavy-walled,  6-inch  diameter  pipes  or  steel  I-beams  approximately  7  feet long,  can  be  used.  A  30-inch  long  steel  pipe  sleeve  is  constructed  into  the base  and  slightly  recessed  from  the  top.  The  inside  diameter  of  the  sleeve should be just large enough to accommodate the posts. The number of rows and spacing may depend upon the availability of time, materials, threat, and location. Pipes can be filled with concrete for additional strength. Stagger the sleeves as indicated, maintaining 4 to 5 feet between posts and 18 inches to the  front  and  back  of  each  row.  Keep  rows  about  10  feet  apart.  Cover  the sleeves when not in use to keep out debris. When required, remove the covers and drop the posts into place (heavy equipment may be needed). Lift handles can  be  welded  to  the  posts  for  easy  removal,  and  concertina  wire  can  be strung throughout the rows to complicate removal by enemy forces. Figure 4.23.

Cubes and cylinders of concrete (Figure 4.24) can be cast in place or precast and moved into place. Place the obstacles in irregular patterns to prevent wheeled and tracked vehicles from moving between them or pushing the obstacles out of position. They can be used between buildings or on top of elevated roadways to block traffic. To be effective vehicle barri-ers, they must be cabled together. Figure 4.24.

Concrete  tetrahe-drons are pyramids with a triangular base, while dragon’s teeth are concrete pyramids with a square base (Figure 4.25). These obstacles are effective in stopping  vehicles  where  access  is  restricted  (i.e.,  roadways  between  build-ings). Dragon’s teeth are employed in multiple rows across an avenue of ap-proach.  Space  the  dragon’s  teeth  about  4  to  5  feet  between  teeth  and  rows across the avenue of approach; rows can be aligned or staggered.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 99Chapter 5 REVETMENTS 5.1. Overview. Revetments are generally defined as raised walls or structures designed to provide protection against bombs, rockets, grenades, small arms fire, and the effects of blast and fragmentation. Revetments can be as simple as a wall of sandbags or as elaborate as major construction projects involving permanent,  hardened  revetments  and  aircraft  shelters  (Figure  5.1).  Revet-ments  of  sufficient  height  can  be  used  to  provide  full  sidewall  protection around open stores of critical equipment and material assets. Revetments can also function as obstacles to vehicles and other forms of possible intrusion. In the expeditionary environment, revetments are commonly composed of a soil berm  and  some  type  of  structural  material  used  as  a  retaining  wall  to  hold back and stabilize the mass of earth. This type of revetment can be very effec-tive against blast and fragmentation effects. This chapter covers the different types of revetments that can be used for a variety of purposes in the expedi-tionary environment. Figure 5.1. Various Types of Revetments.     \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 1005.2. Berms. Time available to conduct comprehensive planning during initial stages  of  deployments  can  be  very  limited.  Logistical  support  needed  to immediately implement force protection measures may also be difficult at the height of a military campaign. Initially, earthen berms may be the engineer’s best  option  for  protecting  military  personnel  and  mission-critical  assets. Properly  sited,  constructed,  and  maintained,  berms  can  mitigate  blast  and fragmentation effects from near-miss explosions caused by mortars, rockets, or artillery shells. They are particularly effective against explosions that pro-duce  blast  effects  moving  at high velocities  and generating  low-angle frag-ments along the ground’s surface. In austere environments, berms can be used to define boundaries, act as barriers, reduce noise, and obstruct lines of sight. The  height  of  force  protection  berms  can  be  anywhere  from  6  to  12  feet. Required heights are usually based on the height of equipment or structures to be protected and known threats within the area or region. While berms and other types of revetments, such as those constructed from sandbags or timber, provide  similar  stopping  ability  for  high-explosive  detonations  and  projec-tiles,  earth  berms  provide  better  protection  against  multiple  or  repeated  at-tacks.  When  an  earth  berm  is  hit,  its  mass  tends  to  engulf  the  round,  and ejected matter falls back onto the berm. Berms can be freestanding, supported by  different  methods  of  revetting,  or  built  directly  upon  structures  for protection. They can also be used to reinforce other protective measures such as reinforced fences, concrete structures, sandbags, or earth-filled containers structures. Regardless of the purpose or type of berm being constructed, much soil  will  be needed.  Berm  construction also  requires heavy  equipment  (i.e., dump truck, backhoe, bulldozer, roller compactor, etc.) to move large masses of  soil  around  and  skilled  equipment  operators.  Engineers  must  take  these factors into consideration while planning for force protection.  It is important to note that earth berms, because of their shapes (i.e., low-sloped faces, lim-ited  heights,  etc.),  have  limited  effectiveness  in  protecting  certain  weapon systems  and  critical  aircraft  support  operations;  therefore,  additional  meas-ures may need to be employed. The next few paragraphs describe the use of berms in the expeditionary environment. Additional information on different types of berms can be downloaded from TCMS.     \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 1015.2.1. Free-Standing Berms. When designing free-standing berms, key ele-ments  to  consider  are  height,  thickness,  and  slope.  Also  keep  in  mind  the need to use natural vegetation, geotextile fabric, and/or a drainage system to prevent erosion. If camouflage and concealment are important, consider add-ing more vegetation and varying the berm’s width and height along the pe-rimeter  to  reduce  its  visual signature.  The  next  few  paragraphs  cover basic considerations for designing and constructing free-standing berms. 5.2.1.1. Berm Height. Berm heights (Figure 5.2) are usually determined by the height of the asset(s) to be protected. If the asset to be protected is 6 feet tall, the berm will need to be at least that height for adequate protection.  Figure 5.2. Berm Height.  5.2.1.2.  Berm  Thickness.  Required  thickness  is  usually  determined  by  the desired  level  of  protection  for  the  asset(s)  and  any  known  threats.  Security and Intelligence personnel will be involved in making this determination. A berm’s  thickness  is  measured  at  its  crest  (Figure  5.3),  which  is  where  the slope of the berm levels off. A small slope is still maintained at the crest to allow for drainage and prevent ponding. If the berm’s required thickness is determined  to  be  36  inches,  the  berm  must  be  36  inches  thick  at  its  crest. Attachment  2  contains  information  on  various  thicknesses  of  materials needed to protect against certain threats. For practical purposes (e.g., mainte-nance), the crest of a free-standing berm is usually between 2 and 3 feet. Figure 5.3. Berm Thickness.   \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 1025.2.1.3.  Berm  Slope.  The  slope  of  a  free-standing  berm  is  approximately equal to the soil’s internal angle of friction or angle of repose (Figure 5.4). The angle of repose is the steepest grade at which the type of soil used will remain in place without reinforcement. If granular or loose soils are used for construction, it will be difficult to obtain a steep slope since the angle of re-pose places limits on the capability to form a steep slope without reinforce-ment. If more cohesive soils (e.g., soils containing clay) are used, it is possi-ble to form a  steeper slope because the soil will remain in place at steeper angles than it would with loose or granular soils. A berm’s slope is described as its vertical to horizontal distance (V:H) as measured from the center of the berm. For force protection berms, the slope is normally between 1:1 and 1:2. Let’s suppose the height (vertical length) of a berm with a 1:1 slope needs to be 10 feet tall, with a 3-foot crest. Without considering the crest size initially, the horizontal length of the berm from the center would also be 10 feet (1:1 slope). However, with a 3 foot crest, the horizontal length of the berm (from its center) will be equal to the height of the berm plus 1 foot and 6 inches, or 11 feet and 6 inches. The additional length accounts for ½ the length of the berm’s crest (3 feet), which is a relatively horizontal surface. Using the same example, we can determine that the total horizontal length of an 11-foot berm with a 1:1 slope and 3 foot crest would be approximately 23 feet (11feet and 6 inches + 11 feet and 6 inches). Figure 5.5 illustrates the difference between berms with slopes between 1:1 and 1:2. Note that the slope gets less steep as the angle of repose decreases. If berm slopes need to be steeper than is possi-ble  with  the  type  of  soil  being  used,  reinforcement  will  be  required.  Some concepts of berm reinforcement are covered in the next few paragraphs.  Figure 5.4. Berm Slope.   \f",

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 1045.2.2. Structurally-Supported Berms. Berms can be supported by bracing or  other  means  of  structural  support  which  allows  them  to  be  constructed much closer to critical assets than free-standing berms (Figure 5.6). Precast concrete  retaining  walls  are  an  excellent  means  of  structural  support  for berms.  If  precast  concrete  obstacles  are  not  available,  expedient  retaining walls can be built using plywood, corrugated metal, landing mats, or what-ever sturdy material might be available with enough strength to provide the needed  support.  Bracing  material  can  be  tied  to  deadman  supports  that  are either  exposed  on  the  face  of  the  berm  or  buried  underneath  (Figure  5.7). When  constructing  these  types  of  berms,  remember  to  allow  enough  room between the structure and the face of the berm to allow personnel space to maneuver heavy equipment or other support needed to perform berm mainte-nance.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 1065.2.2.1.  Reinforcing  Berms.  Berms  can  be  used  to  provide  additional strength  to  other  barriers  such  as  concrete  structures.  If  an  existing  above-ground  concrete  wall  can  resist  airblast  loads  but  the  wall  thickness  is  not sufficient to prevent concrete spall from airblast and fragments, a soil berm placed against the wall is almost always the most economical way to prevent spall (Figure 5.8). Sandbags can be used to reinforce the berm’s face, espe-cially if the berm is constructed of granular materials. Berms can also be built directly upon the structure they are intended to protect (Figure 5.9). In some cases (dictated by the threat), berms can be built upon a structure and contin-ued  over  the  top  of  the  structure.  Engineers  with  experience  in  structural analyses must make the determination on whether any structure can support additional loading from berming. Figure 5.8. Berm Supported by Revetments.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 1075.2.2.2. Berms and Retaining Walls. If precast concrete revetments are not available for expediency, berms can be constructed against retaining walls if the proper materials are available. Building a berm against a retaining wall allows the berm to be located closer to the asset (Figure 5.10). Close place-ment  provides  a  greater  degree  of  protection  from  the  effects  of  blast  and fragmentation.  Retaining  walls  should  be  no  more  than  11  feet  high.  One- sided retaining walls may also be built with 6- by 12-foot posts, 4- by 4-foot horizontal runners, and a sheathing surface of at least 1½ inches of plywood, heavier gauge (16 gauge or better) corrugated metal, or landing mats. Posts should be set at least 4 feet into the ground and no more than 4 feet apart. On the berm side of the posts, starting at ground level, nail horizontal runners to the posts at no more than 2 feet apart for each runner. Fill in between the 4- by 4-foot runners by nailing short sections of 4- by 4-foot pieces to the posts between runners. Fasten the plywood or metal sheathing to the 4 x 4s. There are two ways to anchor the retaining walls to each post. The more protected way is to anchor each post approximately two-thirds the height of the berm to deadman anchors that will be located under the berm material. Use at least 3/8-inch  guy  cable  run  on  a  3:1  slope  (vertical  to  horizontal)  down  to  the deadman anchor. The alternative method is to anchor each post to three indi-vidual  deadman  anchors  placed  along  the  face  of  the  berm.  While  this  can help stabilize the berm, it exposes the anchors to more damage from blast.  Figure 5.10. Berms Supported by Retaining Walls.   \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 1085.3.  Sandbag  Revetments.  Walls  can  be  built  from  sandbags  in  much  the same way as bricks are used to construct walls. Keep in mind, however, that sandbag revetments require a lot of time and labor. In addition, sandbags tend to deteriorate in extreme weather environments. While planning, purchasing, or  ordering  sandbags,  keep  in  mind  that  all  sandbags  are  not  made  of  the same  material  and  are  therefore  not  of  the  same  quality.  For  limited  use, sandbags  of  lesser  quality  can  be  used.  However,  for  prolonged  use  under extreme  weather  conditions,  a  higher  quality  sandbag  may  be  needed.  The following paragraph covers the different types of sandbags that can be used and procedures for building sandbag revetments. 5.3.1. Types of Sandbags. Sandbags most commonly used during contingen-cies are made from cotton, polypropylene, or acrylic materials. The polypro-pylene sandbags tend to last longer than cotton sandbags. Acrylic sandbags (quickly replacing cotton and polypropylene bags) are rot and weather resis-tant.  The  US  Army  Engineer  Research  and  Development  Center  (ERDC) conducted  a  study  of  sandbag  materials’  ultraviolet  (UV)  resistance  to determine  which  products  provide  optimal  service  life  considering  unique exposure  conditions  in  areas  such  as  Southwest  Asia  (SWA).  The  study focused  on  identifying  what  material  maintained  tensile  strength  (property associated  with  the  material’s  integrity)  under  prolonged  exposure  to  UV radiation.  The  study  concluded  cotton  duck  material  performs  best  under these conditions, followed by acrylic  materials, which also performed well.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 1095.3.2.  Siting  Sandbag  Revetments.  Sandbag  revetments  may  not  provide effective protection from blast overpressure if not properly sited. These types of revetments may be effective against fragmentation effects; however, unless the shielding can be located very close to the asset as shown in Figure 5.11, blast  overpressure  may  still  impact  the  asset.  If  revetments  are  sited  close enough to the protected asset, they may be able to deflect the blast wave over the asset to prevent damage. If a structure can withstand the additional side load,  sandbag  revetments  can  also  be  built  with  a  straight  face  against  the wall of the structure (Figure 5.12).  Figure 5.11. Sandbag Revetment Close to Protected Asset. Figure 5.12. Sandbag Revetment Built Against a Structure.     \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 1105.3.3. Sandbag Revetment Construction Details. After properly siting the location for sandbag revetments, begin by filling the bags approximately 3/4 full with soil or a soil-cement mixture. Overfilling the sandbags will prevent them from being flattened or shaped. To fill in voids between bags, fill bags with less soil. The useful life of sandbags can be prolonged by filling them with a mixture of dry earth and cement, normally in the ratio of 1 part cement to 10 parts dry earth. The cement sets as the bags take on moisture. A ratio of 1:6 should be used for a sand-gravel mixture. To expedite the sandbag filling process, an expedient sandbag filler such as that illustrated in Figure 5.13, can be constructed if materials are available. Prefabricated sandbag fillers can also be purchased commercially (check with the servicing logistics function).   Figure 5.13. Expedient Sandbag Filler.     \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 1115.3.3.1. Free-Standing Sandbag Revetment. For a free-standing revetment, the sandbags should be sloped between 4:1 and 5:1 (vertical to horizontal) for any structure over 2 feet (Figure 5.14). Construct the bottom row of the re-vetment with sandbags placed as headers; then, alternate rows of headers and stretchers as indicated, staggering the joints between layers of sandbags. Each sandbag should be pounded with a flat object, such as a 2- by 4-inch board, to make the wall more stable. Stretchers should be placed with the sewn seams facing towards the reveted face, while headers are placed with the tied ends facing towards the reveted face. Ensure the top row of the revetment consist of headers. Before constructing sandbag revetments, determine if the base of the structure will need to be reinforced. Figure 5.14.

Use landing mats, corrugated metal sheets, reinforced ply-wood, or other structural facing material on the vertical surface of the revet-ment and tie it to the sloped face for support (Figure 5.15).

Metal bin revetments are designed to provide shelter or protection from low-angle, high-velocity fragments, shrapnel, and impro-vised explosive devices. They can also be used as anti-ram vehicle barriers. These  types  of  revetments  are  made  from  some  type  of  roll-formed  metal, typically 16-gauge or 18-gauge steel.  5.4.1. B-1 Revetment. The B-1 revetment comes in a kit that provides a 16-foot high, 82-inch wide, and 252-foot long steel bin revetment (Figure 5.16). Due to the large concentrated mass of fill material required for this revetment, it must be constructed on a stabilized ground surface or pavement. The cell sections of the revetment are assembled in place or can be assembled on the ground and lifted into place with the use of a crane. When filling, use a po-rous  material  or  a  1/2-  to  3/4-inch  gravel  layer  at  the  bottom  to  allow  for drainage, an impervious sheeting material along the sides to contain soil ma-terial,  and  a  waterproof  cap  to  prevent  fill  saturation  or  FOD  hazards.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 1155.5. Precast Concrete Revetments. The use of precast concrete revetments (also referred to as concrete retaining walls) is an effective expedient method for  protecting  critical  assets  (Figure  5.18).  They  can  be  used  in  areas  that require  protection  from  fragmentation,  airblast  from  near-miss  general-purpose  bombs,  and  high  explosive  artillery  shells,  rockets,  mortars,  and small arms. If used without berming, they provide good protection against a first  strike,  but  limited  protection  from  repeated  or  multiple  attacks  due  to susceptibility  to  fragment  damage  and  spalling.  During  repeated  attacks, weakened or displaced slabs can break apart and become secondary fragmen-tation, posing yet another threat. The edges of most revetments do not have overlapping surfaces at the corners. The corners may require additional rein-forcement  (e.g.,  sandbags).  If  concrete  revetments  can  be  acquired  locally, ensure  the  material  used  to  construct  these  revetments  meets  military  stan-dards  of  construction.  Also,  be  aware  that  equipment  (i.e.,  flatbed  trailer, forklift, crane, etc.) will be needed to move and place these revetments.   Figure 5.18. Precast Concrete Revetment.      \f",

This type of revetment can be from 5 to 15 feet high, 6 feet wide, and 6 inches thick. The freestanding units can be butted together  side-by-side  and  at  90-degree  corners;  they  can  also  be  enhanced with berms.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 1175.7. Soil-Cement Revetments. Soil-cement revetments provide greater pro-tection from fragmentation and require less surface area than earthen berms (Figure 5.20). The walls of these revetments can be constructed with a 10:1 vertical-to-horizontal slope with a crest at least two feet thick. However, be aware that formwork and proper mixing equipment are required for construc-tion.  Depending  on  the  wall’s  height,  the  foundation  may  require  a  higher bearing capacity than a soil berm and may have to be improved with a mix-ture  of  cement.  In  addition,  walls  with  significant  heights  may  need  to  be built in several lifts. If possible, build the formwork strong enough to allow forming  in  one  or  two  lifts.  If  lifts  are  used,  consider  using  some  form  of doweling between the lifts. The amount of water needed to moisten the mix-ture and allow cement hydration and the ratio of cement-to-soil (by weight) will  vary  based  on  soil  type.

Precast concrete culverts are constructed in various sizes,  but  are  usually  limited  to  8-foot  lengths  for  ease  of  handling.  If  the concrete  culvert’s  outside  diameter  is  at  least  30  inches,  it  can  be  used  for protective  construction.  Larger  diameter  culverts  (up  to  6  feet  in  diameter) can also be used. The culverts are stood up on end to stabilize the foundation and  positioned  closely  together.  If  possible,  obtain  straight-sided  culverts (without grooved ends) so they can be placed together vertically without any gaps between them. If the culverts have bell ends, place the larger bell ends down  and  fill  in  the  gaps  between  rows  with  filled,  smaller  diameter  PVC pipe or concrete culverts. Use at least two rows of culverts, and stagger the joints  as  indicated  in  Figure  5.21.  If  available,  drive  steel  dowels  or  pipes into the ground at the center of each pipe to stabilize them. Fill the culverts with dry sand or soil and cap the tops with at least 10 inches of concrete and a short length of exposed dowel or pipe. Tie the dowels together by welding reinforcing  bars  to  the  dowels  on  each  row  and  between  the  opposite  two adjoining culverts. Do not stack culverts on top of each other. Be aware that concrete  culverts  come  in  various  strengths  to  resist  traffic  loads.  Culverts with little traffic loading capacity are usually constructed with lower quality concrete and less reinforcing, making them unsuitable for use. Figure 5.21. Concrete Culvert Soil Bin.   \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 1195.9.  Timber  and  Lumber  Revetments.  There  is  little  difference  between timber and lumber revetments except the raw materials. They are both built like plywood walls, except that the inside facing material is either saplings or lumber (Figure 5.22). The facing timbers of the timber revetment are usually 2- to 3-inch sapling trunks laid parallel, one on top of the other and fitted to-gether to avoid gaps. The facing lumber of a lumber revetment is a minimum 2-inch  thick  board  or  2  inches  of  layered  plywood  sheathing.  For  a  timber revetment, the posts are usually 6 inches in diameter and spaced no more than 2 feet apart, while lumber revetments use 2- by 4-inch studs spaced about 12 inches apart. The posts are normally set 2 feet into the ground for bracing and have 3 tie-cables run between opposite posts. One cable provides a tie at mid-height, while the other two cables are at about 1/6 the height from the top and the bottom, respectively. As a minimum, every other post is tied. The ends of the revetments are blocked with additional posts of timber or lumber; there-fore, the minimum width of the revetment can be greater than the plywood wall type revetment. As a minimum, the walls are built in cells every 10 feet. A cross-braced wall is built within the lumber revetment by using 2 sets of 4- by 4-inch posts set 2 inches apart to create a slot on the inside of each wall. Then 2-inch thick lumber is stacked in the slot to create a cross-braced wall section.  For  the  timber  wall,  two  sets  of  the  6-inch  diameter  posts  are  set about 3 inches apart on each side of the wall. Cross members are notched and stacked to fit into the facing logs. Timber and lumber revetments are filled with soil to provide strength and stability for these expedient structures.  Figure 5.22. Timber and Lumber Revetments.   \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 1205.10. Sand Grid Revetments. Sand grids are prefabricated forms that expand into  honeycomb-shaped  cells  used  to  confine  fill  material  such  as  sand  or gravel. Original grids were 38 inches wide, 8 inches high, and 20 feet long when expanded. Grids with varying sizes (e.g., widths up to 8 feet) are now available. Figure 5.23 illustrates how sand grid revetments are constructed. Grids are laid out over metal pickets at each end and stacked one layer upon the next. The maximum freestanding height for a revetment 38 inches wide is 8  feet  (12  layers),  although  only  a  height  of  6  feet  (9  layers)  are  recom-mended unless additional picket anchors are added to the standard anchors. To  achieve  additional  height,  lower  rows  should  be  laid  with  either  wider sand grids or additional rows of sand grids run parallel, face to face. Middle and upper rows are made with narrower sand grids. Make sure all rows have anchor pickets or additional intermediate pickets extending to several adjoin-ing layers. If rows are run parallel, face to face, tie the rows together for sta-bility. To prevent erosion and soil loss with sand grids that are not notched, place a geotextile fabric between each layer of sand grid and cover the top layer with impervious sheeting and sandbags. For additional details on con-structing sand grids, refer to the manufacturer’s instructions or access TCMS. Figure 5.23. Sand Grid Revetment Construction.    \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 1215.11. Earth-Filled Container Revetments. Earth-filled container revetments have proven to be very effective in protecting critical assets in expeditionary environments. When planning to use these materials for revetment construc-tion, keep in mind that small hand tools and heavy equipment, such as front-end loaders, cranes with buckets and dump trucks, will also be needed. The following  paragraphs  describe  typical  construction  of  a  revetment  using earth-filled containers. For details on infill procedures, refer to Chapter 2. In addition,  detailed  information  on  constructing  various  types  of  revetments using wire mesh containers can be found in the manufacturer’s instructions or downloaded from TCMS. 5.11.1. Site Selection and Preparation. Revetments must be constructed on well-drained,  flat,  and  stable  surfaces.  If  necessary,  follow  the  guidance  in Chapter 2 to improve surface areas where revetments will be constructed. 5.11.2. Materials. Constructing a revetment 9 feet high and 8 feet long might require approximately 6 sections of wire mesh container sections, assuming there are 9 bays per section, and each bay is 56 inches high and 42 inches wide.  5.11.3. First Layer. Once a site is selected, lay out the units as depicted in Figure  5.24,  ensuring  the  attached  plastic  wire  ties  are  located  at  the  top. Overlap the coil hinges located at the common corners between sections, and insert  the  connecting  pin  (Figure 5.25).  Once  all  three  sections  of  the  first layer are connected, expand the bays 2 to 4 inches and begin filling the corner bays, and then every 8th to 12th bay thereafter with 1 foot of lightly com-pacted fill placed in two 6-inch lifts to anchor the layer for the remaining fill. Once anchored, fill the remaining bays. Use manual hand tampers or lightly compact the fill material by foot – do not use compacting equipment. 5.11.4. Second Layer. Arrange units as illustrated in Figure 5.26. Connect the second layer to the first layer using the plastic ties. Fill the units with soil and make sure it is very well compacted. Upon completing the second layer, conduct a quick visual inspection, making sure the walls are straight, there is no excessive movement of the walls, and that adequate clear distance is pro-vided between the walls.   \f",

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 1235.12. Siting Revetments. Revetments must be properly sited to mitigate the effects  of  blast  and  fragmentation.  Some  basic  principles  for  siting  large structural revetments are listed in Table 5.3. In general, revetments should be sited as close as possible to protected assets. If not, fragmentation effects may be  mitigated  but  the  blast  overpressure  can  still  cause  damage  since  blast waves  tend  to  reform  after  traveling  over  objects.  Figure  5.27  and  Figure 5.28 are examples of improperly and properly sited revetments. When siting revetments, safe operational clearance for assets such as aircraft must also be considered.  With  the  exception  of  revetments  designed  for  parked  aircraft, most revetments are designed to prevent straight-in access to the assets being protected. Aircraft revetments, in particular must be arranged in a manner that prevents  propagation  between  cells  of  multiple  revetments.  This  is  a  major concern  for  engineers.  When  aircraft  loaded  with  cannon  rounds,  rockets, missiles, and bombs are exposed to extreme heat from a detonation or from other  burning  aircraft,  the  weapons  may  tend  to  cook-off  and  detonate  or launch. By dispersing aircraft such that cells do not face each other and fuel drains away from other aircraft, propagation can be limited (Figure 5.29). If dispersal  is  not  possible,  such  as  on  an  aircraft  parking  or  refueling  ramp, clusters of revetments (Figure 5.30) can be used. Figure 5.31 illustrates  Table 5.3. Principles for Siting Large Structural Revetments. Action Align revetments in a manner that will block direct paths to the protected asset and prevent or mitigate the effects of fragmentation from a nearby weapons detonation  Extend revetments far enough past the protected asset to cut down the angles of exposure.   3  Where revetments are not connected, overlap them to eliminate any direct paths to the protected assets  If revetments cannot be overlapped (e.g., entrance corners), develop alternative methods for protecting the assets from the effects of blast and fragmentation at these openings (i.e., portable concrete revetments, sandbag revetments, etc.). 5  When angles of exposure cannot be decreased (e.g. aircraft revetments), do not place decoys in areas to block exposure Step 1 2 4   \f",

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 139Attachment 2 PROTECTIVE MATERIALS A2.1.  Overview.  When  planning  and  designing  fighting  positions,  shelters ,and other protective structures, it is important to know the characteristics of certain  materials  and  how  they  might  be  affected  by  certain  weapons.  The following  paragraphs  describe  materials  that  might  be  available  and  how these materials can be used effectively in the expeditionary environment.   A2.2. Characteristics of Materials. Engineers should be aware that different types  of  materials  offer  different  degrees  of  protection.  For  protective  con-struction efforts, certain materials can be used for shielding or as structural components to hold shielding materials in place. A2.2.1. Soil. Soil can be an effective shield against direct fire, indirect fire, blast, or fragmentation effects. Dense soils offer more protection and resis-tance to penetration. Coarse-grained soils provide better protection than fine-grained soils with the same density. Dry sandy soil provides better protection than silt, clay, and silty-clay soils. Saturated soils offer a less degree of resis-tance to penetrating projectiles, as illustrated in Figure A2.1. Wet clay is the most susceptible to ballistic penetration. Figure A2.1. Soil Resistance to Penetration.   \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 140A2.2.2.  Concrete.  Steel  reinforced  concrete  provides  excellent  protection against  direct  fire,  indirect  fire,  and  fragmentation.  However,  placement  of concrete structures is important, as they are subject to fail when a large deto-nation occurs nearby and can themselves become secondary fragmentation. A2.2.3.  Steel.  Steel  provides  excellent  protection  against  fragmentation  re-sulting  from  direct-  and  indirect-fired  weapons.  Obstacles  made  from  steel can be effectively utilized to resist the effects of many types of weapons.       A2.2.4.  Rocks.  Rocks  can  be  effective  against  direct  and  indirect  fire  and fragmentation.  Hard  rocks  can  deform,  stop,  or  deflect  projectiles.  Small rocks and gravel can be used similar to soil and is less susceptible to mois-ture. A disadvantage of using rocks is that they can become weakened after multiple hits or become projectiles if dislodged by blast or upon impact. A2.2.5. Brick and Masonry. Brick and masonry have similar characteristics of  rocks  against  penetration  and  fragmentation  effects.  However,  unrein-forced brick and masonry do not afford the same protection as concrete be-cause of less density. A2.2.6. Snow and Ice. Snow and ice may be the only material available at some  locations  and  may  be  effective  against  small  caliber  weapons  and nearby blast when used in mass or in combination with frozen soil.  A2.2.7.  Lumber  and  Timber.  Wood  (e.g.,  lumber,  plywood,  timber)  has limited value in stopping projectiles or fragments due to its low density. This material needs to be very thick to stop small caliber and anti-tank weapons. A2.2.8. Miscellaneous Materials.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 144Attachment 3 FIELD CLASSIFICATION OF SOILS A3.1. Overview. Tests described in this attachment will help in classifying different types of soil in the field environment. These tests are based on in-formation  contained  in  AFJMAN  32-1034,  Materials  Testing,  FM  5-410, Military Soils Engineering, and UFC 3-220-10N, Soil Mechanics. Engineers should become familiar with these references and ensure they are available during deployments.       A3.2.  Soil  Classification.  The  Unified  Soil  Classification  System  (USCS) divides  soils  into  one  of  three  major  categories  which  include  (1)  coarse-grained, (2) fine-grained, and (3) highly organic. These soils are further di-vided  into  major  categories  based  on  their  properties  and  characteristics.  Table A3.1 contains symbols used to group different types of soils and dis-tinguish soils with different characteristics. These symbols are combined to further describe soils (e.g., GW = well-graded gravel).  Table A3.1. Soil Groups and Characteristics    Soil Groups Symbol Soil Characteristics Group Gravel Sand Silt Clay Well graded Poorly graded High compressibility Low compressibility Organic (peat) Organic (silts and clays) Liquid limits under 50 Liquid limits over 50 G S M C W P H L Pt O L H  \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 145A3.3.  Field  Classification  and  Testing.  Although  most  tests  can  be  per-formed without laboratory equipment, using No. 40 and No. 200 sieves pro-vides  better  accuracy  and  speeds  up  testing.  Sieves  are  screens  attached across  the  end  of  a  cylindrical  metal  frame.  The  screen  allows  particles smaller than its openings to fall through and retains larger particles. Sieves with  screen  openings  of  different  sizes  allow  you  to  sort  soil  into  particle groups based on size (Figure A3.1).  A3.3.1. Visual Examination. A visual examination can be used to establish the color, grain sizes, and grain shapes of the coarse-grained portion, some idea of the gradation; and some properties of the undisturbed soil. While vis-ual examinations may require a large sample of soil, these tests can usually be conducted with a pint (approximately one canteen cup full) of soil. Soil sam-ples should be taken from the levels of soil that will be exposed during con-struction  and  are  related  to  the  structural  strength  of  the  construction.  For example, if soil needs to be tested for a fighting position, the sample should be taken from the exposed wall material that will be a part of the structure rather than the topsoil layer.     A3.3.1.1. Colors. Color helps to distinguish between soil types. It can also indicate  the  presence  of  certain  chemicals  or  impurities.  Colors  in  general become darker as moisture content increases and lighter as soil dries. Some fine-grained soils with dark, drab shades of brown or gray (including almost black)  contain  organic  colloidal  matter.  Clean,  bright  shades  of  gray,  olive green,  brown,  red,  yellow,  and  white  are  associated  with  inorganic  soils.  Gray-blue  or  gray-and-yellow  mottled  colors  frequently  result  from  poor drainage. Red, yellow, and yellowish-brown soils result from the presence of iron  oxides.  White  to  pink  soils  may  indicate  considerable  silica,  calcium carbonate, or aluminum compounds.        \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 146Figure A3.1. Standard Sieve Set.    A3.3.1.2. Grain Sizes. The sample size of gravels range down to the size of peas, about ¼-inch (e.g., materials retained on a No. 4 sieve). Sands start just below this size and decrease until individual grains are just distinguishable by the naked eye.  The eye can normally see individual grains about 0.07 milli-meters in size (about the size of the No. 200 sieve). Silt and clay particles, which are smaller than sands, are indistinguishable as individual particles.  A3.3.1.3. Grain Shapes. Shapes of visible particles can be determined while the sample is examined for grain sizes. Sharp edges and flat surfaces indicate angular  shapes,  while  smooth,  curved  surfaces  indicate  rounded  shapes.  Some particles may not be completely angular or rounded. These shapes are referred  to  as  either  subangular  or  subrounded,  depending  on  which  shape predominates.    \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 147A3.3.1.4. Distribution of Grain Sizes. While laboratory analysis is needed to determine accurate distribution of grain sizes, a field approximation can be made by separating larger grains from the remainder of the soil. Table A3.2 contains field methods for determining distribution of grain sizes.  Table A3.2. Distribution of Grain Sizes.    2 3     1 Separate  larger  grains  (gravel  and  some sand particles down to about 1/8-inch and larger)  from  the  remainder  of  the  soil.  Examine  the  remainder  of  the  soil  and estimate the proportion of visible individ-ual  particles  (larger  than  No.  200  sieve) and the fines (smaller than No. 200 sieve). Convert  these  estimates  into  percentages by weight of the total sample. Examine coarse-grained soil for gradation of  particle  sizes  from  the  largest  to  the smallest Estimate  the  percentage  of  the  fine-grained portion of the coarse-grained soil If  the  fines  exceed  50  percent,  the soil  is  considered  fine-grained  (silt--M,  clay--C,  or  organic--O).  If  the coarse  material  exceeds  50  percent, the  soil  is  coarse-grained  (gravel--G or sand--S) If  there  is  a  good  distribution  of  all sizes,  this  means  the  soil  is  well-graded (W). If there is an overabun-dance or lack of any size, this means the material is poorly graded (P) If  less  than  5  percent  (non-plastic fines)  of  the  total,  the  soil  may  be classified either as a GW, GP, SW, or SP  type,  depending  on  the  other  in-formation  noted  above.  If  the  fine-grained  portion  exceeds  12  percent, the  soil  will  be  either  M  or  C  and requires further testing to identify. If the fine-grained portion is between 5 and  12  percent  (non-plastic  fines  or fines  not  interfering  with  free  drain-age),  the  soil  is  borderline  and  re-quires  double  symbols  such  as  GW-GM  or  SW-SM.  Note:  Fine-grained soils (M, C, or O) require other tests to distinguish them further \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 148A3.3.1.5. Undisturbed Soil Properties. Using characteristics determined up to this point, evaluate the soil as it appeared in place. Gravels or sands can be described qualitatively as loose, medium, or dense. Clays may be hard, stiff, or soft. The ease or difficulty with which the sample was removed from the ground is a good indicator. Soils that have been cultivated or farmed can be further  evaluated  as  loose  or  compressible.  Highly  organic  soils  can  be spongy or elastic. In addition, the moisture content of the soil influences the in-place  characteristics.  This  condition  should  be  recognized  and  reported with the undisturbed soil properties.  A3.3.2. Sedimentation Test. The visual observation test is used to approxi-mate the proportions of sand and gravel in a soil by spreading the dry sample out on a flat surface and separating the gravel particles by hand. When No. 40 and No. 200 sieves are not available, separating the fines from the sand parti-cles is achieved by the sedimentation test. Place a small amount of the fine fraction of soil, such as a heaping tablespoon, in a transparent container, such as a jar. Break up any lumps of soil (especially the clays) by grinding the soil in  a  canteen  cup  and  add  it  back  to  the  container.  Cover  the  sample  with about 5 inches of water and agitate by stirring or shaking. The soil particles will settle out in the time periods indicated in Table A3.3.   Table A3.3. Sedimentation Test Settling Times.  Approximate Settlement Time (5 inches of water)  2 Seconds 30 Seconds 10 Minutes 1 Hour Grain Diameter  Differentiates (mm/inch) Coarse Sand – 0.4 / 0.0157 Fine Sand 0.072 / 0.0028 Sand – Fines Coarse Silt – 0.03 / 0.0118 Fine Silt 0.01 / 0.00039 Silt – Clay     \f",
      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 149A3.3.3. Results of Sedimentation Test. The test will differentiate the coarse fraction from the fine fraction of a soil. The coarse materials are larger than 0.4 mm and would be retained on a No. 40 sieve. Fine sands fall between 0.4 mm and 0.7 mm. The fine materials will be less than 0.072 mm and would be material passing a No. 200 sieve. To obtain the fines, wait 30 seconds after shaking  and  then  gently  pour  the  liquid  with  suspended  fines  into  another container.  Add  additional  water  to  the  original  container  and  shake  again.  Repeat the above process with the just used sample, again waiting 30 seconds and pouring the clearer liquid into the second container. Repeat until the liq-uid appears clear. Pour the water with the fines into a flat pan; dry the soil in the container (i.e., the sand) and the soil in the pan (i.e., the fines) by letting the  water  be  wicked  or  evaporated  off.  Determine  the  relative  amounts  of fines and sand.   A3.3.4. Modified Sedimentation Test.  For  the  numerous  tests  that  require use of all fines (i.e., the fines and fine sand materials passing a No. 40 sieve), the  above  procedure  can  be  modified  to  provide  this  test  material.  Take  a sample of the original material and separate out the gravel particles by hand.  Place a small amount of the fine fraction of soil in a transparent container and break up any lumps of soil (especially if clay) by grinding the soil in a can-teen  cup  with  an  improvised  wood  pestle  and  add  back  to  the  container.  Cover the sample with about 5 inches of water and agitate by stirring or shak-ing. Between 1 and 2 seconds after stopping the agitation, pour off the water with the suspended materials into a flat pan and dry the soil. The soil in the pan will contain particles in the fine and fine sand range.    A3.3.5. Breaking or Dry Strength Test and Powder Test.  Perform  these tests only on material passing the No. 40 sieve. Prepare a pat of soil about 2 inches  in  diameter  and  ½-inch  thick  by  molding  it  in  a  wet,  plastic  state.   Allow  the  pat  to  dry  completely.  Once  dried,  grasp  the  pat  between  the thumbs and forefingers of both hands and attempt to break it. Figure A3.2 illustrates  the  proper  way  to  hold  the  pat.  If  the  pat  breaks,  perform  the “Powder Test” by taking a portion of the broken pat and rubbing it with the thumb in an attempt to flake particles off. Table A3.4 can be used to draw conclusions from these tests.  \f",

The cast test is performed by mixing a representative por-tion of the sample with water until it can be molded or shaped without stick-ing to the fingers. Compress the soil into a ball or cigar-shaped cast. Observe the ability of the sample to withstand handling without crumbling. Use Table A3.5 to draw conclusions based on the cast test.   Table A3.5.

Roll  or  Thread  Test.  This  test  is  performed  only  on  the  material passing the No. 40 sieve. A portion of the sample is mixed with water until it can be molded or shaped without sticking to the fingers. Shape the sample into a ball or an elongated cylinder and roll the prepared soil cylinder (on a flat,  nonabsorbent  surface)  rapidly  into  a  thread  approximately  1/8-inch  in diameter. The technique is shown in Figure A3.3. If the moist soil rolls into a thread, it is said to have some plasticity. Plasticity is a property of the fine-grained portion  of  a  soil  that  allows  it  to be  deformed  beyond  the point  of recovery without cracking or appreciable volume change. This property per-mits  clay  to  be  rolled  into  thin  threads  at  some  moisture  content  without crumbling. Some minerals, such as quartz powder, cannot be made plastic no matter how fine the particles nor how much water is added. Thus, the degree of plasticity is a general index to the clay content of a soil. The number of times it can be lumped back together and rolled into a thread without crum-bling is a measure of the degree of plasticity of the soil. Materials that cannot be rolled in this manner are non-plastic or have a very low plasticity. Table A3.6 can be used to draw conclusions for the roll or thread test.   \f",

A representative portion of the sample is mixed with water until it can be molded or shaped without sticking to the fingers. Form a roll of soil about ½- to ¾-inches in diameter and 3 to 5 inches long. Lay the roll across the palm of one hand (palm up), and starting at one end, squeeze the roll be-tween the thumb and forefinger over the edge of the hand to form a flat, un-broken ribbon about 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick. Allow the ribbon as formed to hang free and unsupported (Figure A3.4). Continue squeezing and handling the roll carefully to form the maximum length of ribbon that can be supported only by the cohesive properties of the soil. Use Table A3.7 to draw conclu-sions.

A repre-sentative portion  of  the  sample  (enough  material  to  form  a  ball  of  material about  3/4-inch  in  diameter)  is  mixed  with  water  until  it  can  be  molded  or shaped without sticking to the fingers. The sample (soil pat) is then spread across the palm of the hand with the blade of a knife or small spatula. Shake the hand with the soil pat horizontally and strike that hand vigorously with the other hand. Check the soil for a reaction where water comes to the sur-face, producing a smooth, shiny appearance. This appearance is described as livery. Squeeze the sample between the thumb and forefinger using the other hand.  Check  to  see  if  the  surface  water  quickly  disappears,  the  surface  be-comes dull, and the material becomes firm, resisting deformation. Continue to apply pressure and check to see if cracks occur and the sample crumbles like a brittle material. Very fine sands and silts can be readily identified with the wet shaking test. However, it is rare to find fine sands and silts without some amount of clay, which causes varying reactions to the wet shaking test. Even a small amount of clay will tend to greatly retard this reaction when the water comes to the surface. Table A3.8 can be used to draw conclusions using the wet shaking test.    Figure A3.5.

      "AFH 10-222 Volume 14  1 August 2008 156A3.3.13. Wash, Dust and Smear Test. The wash, dust, and smear test in-volves  a  couple  of  methods  with  varying  results.  Only  material  passing through  the  No.  40  sieve  is  used  for  this  test.  For  the  first  method,  take  a small, completely dry sample of soil and drop it from a height of 1 to 2 feet above  a  clean,  solid  surface.  Acknowledge  the  results  to  determine  the amount of dust that is produced. Refer to Table A3.11 to draw conclusions.   The second method involves taking a small amount of soil and adding water to  it  until  it  is  moist  but  does  not  stick  to  the  fingers.  The  sample  is  then smeared  between  the  thumb  and  forefinger.  Acknowledge  the  results  and again use Table A3.11 to draw conclusions.  Table A3.11. Wash, Dust, and Smear Test Results and Indications.  Result Indications Fairly large amount of dust produced Very little dust is produced Sample is a silty sand (SM) Sample is clean sand. Check the grada-tion (SW or SP) First Method Second Method Test produces a gritty, harsh feel Test produces a rough but less harsh feel  Sample contains a small amount of silt. Check the gradation (SW or SP) Soil contains about 10 percent silt (SM)  A3.3.14. Feel Test. Perform feel tests only with material passing the No. 40 sieve. This is done by rubbing the sample between the fingers and observing the texture. Determine if it is floury, smooth, gritty, or sharp. Rub the sample on the inside of the wrist. Sand will feel gritty and silts (if dry) will dust read-ily and feel soft and silky. Clay will powder with difficulty, but feel smooth and  gritless  like  flour.  If  the  sample  is  clay,  squeeze  a  piece  of  the  undis-turbed  soil  between  the  thumb  and  forefinger  to  determine  its  consistency.  Remold the soil by working it between the hands and observe the results. If the sample becomes fluid, it is clay that is probably near the liquid limit. If the  sample  remains  stiff  and  crumbles  when  reworked,  it  is  probably  clay below the plastic limit.   \f",
